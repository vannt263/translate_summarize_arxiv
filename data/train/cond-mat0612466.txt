    ", the field has blossomed to the point where nearly all model many - body problems have now been solved@xcite , and much recent work has focused on applying dmft principles to real materials calculations@xcite .",
    "little work has emphasized nonequilibrium aspects of the many - body problem , where the strongly correlated system is driven by an external field that can possibly sustain a nonequilibrium steady state . in this contribution",
    ", we will review recent work that has been completed on expanding dmft approaches into the nonequilibrium realm .",
    "we will show how to work with so - called gauge - invariant green functions@xcite to illustrate that one can carry out calculations in a form that manifestly is independent of the gauge chosen to describe the driving fields .",
    "this approach is different from our previously published work , where we worked solely with green functions in the hamiltonian gauge ( where the scalar potential vanishes ) .",
    "we examine the problem of strongly correlated electrons driven by a spatially uniform electric field in the limit of infinite dimensions@xcite , where dmft can be applied to solve the problem exactly . in infinite dimensions ,",
    "the self - energy of the electrons is local , and the lattice problem can be mapped onto the problem of an impurity coupled to an effective time - dependent field ( which is adjusted so that the impurity green function and the local green function on the lattice are identical ) .",
    "the impurity problem in the dynamical mean field can be solved exactly for many different cases . in equilibrium ,",
    "a large number of strongly correlated models have been solved in infinite dimensions , like the falicov - kimball model@xcite , the hubbard model , the periodic anderson model , and the holstein model@xcite , ( for a reviews , see refs .   and ) .",
    "recently , there has been a significant effort in combining dmft with density functional theory ( dft ) to describe properties of real materials when dft is insufficient to properly describe the electron - electron interactions ( see ref .   for a review ) .",
    "it is now generally believed that dmft is a good approximation to the many - body problem in three dimensions , and it can accurately describe strong electron - electron correlation effects in bulk systems .",
    "the first attempt to employ dmft to describe nonequilibrium properties of a strongly correlated model was made by schmidt and monien in ref .",
    ", where they studied the spectral properties of the hubbard model in the presence of a time - dependent chemical potential by using iterated perturbation theory ( pt ) .",
    "recently , we have developed a generalized nonequilibrium dmft formalism to study the response of correlated electrons to a spatially uniform time - dependent electric field and applied that formalism to the falicov - kimball model@xcite .",
    "the falicov - kimball model@xcite , is the simplest model for strongly correlated electrons that demonstrates long range order and undergoes a metal - to - mott - insulator transition .",
    "it consists of two kinds of electrons : conducting @xmath0-electrons and localized @xmath1-electrons , which interact through an on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "the model was introduced to describe valence - change and metal - insulator transitions@xcite in rare - earth and transition - metal compounds .",
    "it was reinvented as a model to describe crystal formation@xcite resulting from the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "dmft was actually developed with the original solution of the falicov - kimball model in infinite dimensions and now there is an almost complete understanding of its general properties ( for a review , see ref .  ) .",

    "we summarize the successes of recent work to generalize dmft to nonequilibrium problems with a focus on solutions of the spinless falicov - kimball model on an infinite - dimensional hypercubic lattice in the presence of an external time - dependent electric field .",
    "there are many interesting and surprising results which differ from semiclassical predictions ( such as those made from the boltzmann equation solution ) .",
    "in addition to the exact solutions , we also present results for the noninteracting case and for the case of second - order perturbation theory in the interaction .",
    "in particular , we analyze the limitations of the perturbation theory approximation , especially in studying ( long - time ) steady - state behavior .",

    "we then map the many - body problem on the lattice to an impurity problem , but in a dynamical mean field that mimics the hopping of electrons onto and off of the given site .",
    "it turns out that one needs the full freedom available with the three - branch contour to find the proper dynamical mean field to map the impurity onto the lattice .",
    "hence , our approach will work with the less common green functions on the three - branch contour , as opposed to a simpler two - branch contour , which we work with when we discuss the perturbative approach on the lattice .",

    "one can solve the equilibrium problem for the conduction electrons exactly at any temperature , particle concentration and coulomb repulsion .",
    "the key simplification , which allows one to obtain the exact solution as @xmath22 , comes from the fact that the electron self - energy is momentum - independent@xcite .",
    "although that original work was performed in equilibrium , langreth s rules@xcite guarantee that it also holds for the nonequilibrium case .    nowadays , most of the equilibrium properties of the model , including the phase diagram , are well known ( see ref .",

    "the density of states @xmath29 is not equal to zero for frequencies inside the `` gap region '' , but is exponentially suppressed , except for @xmath30 .",
    "therefore , the density of states actually demonstrates a pseudogap in the insulating phase , which is an artifact of the fact that the infinite - dimensional hypercubic lattice has a gaussian density of states for the noninteracting problem , which does not have a finite bandwidth .",
    "another important feature is the behavior of the imaginary part of the self - energy for frequencies close to zero in the `` metallic '' phase : @xmath31 ( @xmath0 and @xmath32 and independent of temperature ) , which differs from the standard fermi liquid behavior @xmath33 ( @xmath34 and @xmath35 and @xmath36 as @xmath37 ) .",

    ", one needs to prepare a system where the scattering time is longer than the period of the bloch oscillations . in solids ,",
    "the scattering time is much shorter than the oscillation period , so this effect is not observed .",
    "however , bloch oscillations are seen in semiconductor superlattices , where the period of oscillations is much shorter due to the larger lattice spacing . as we show in the following sections ,",
    "the effects of strong electron - electron correlations modify the bloch oscillations significantly , but the driven oscillations in large fields survive for a surprisingly long time .",
    "now we discuss the time - dependence of the density of states ( dos ) for noninteracting electrons in a constant electric field .",
    "the dos is found by using the wigner time coordinates in eq .",

    "the weight of these peaks is@xcite : @xmath133),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the @xmath134th bloch frequency , @xmath135 .",
    "it takes an infinite amount of time for the delta functions to develop .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] , we show how the dos evolves from the time the field is turned on , at @xmath136 , to a large time .",
    "the dos remains gaussian for @xmath137 and then develops large oscillations as @xmath75 increases .",
    "though the dos oscillates and acquires negative values in the transient regime , it is possible to show ( numerically ) that its first three moments always satisfy the relevant sum rules .      in this section we present the results for the interacting case@xcite , where we vary the coulomb repulsion through the metal - insulator transition that occurs at @xmath138 .",
    "the problem is solved by numerically solving the dmft loop in eqs .",
    "( [ dmft1])-([dmft3 ] ) .",
    "once the green functions and self - energy have been found by self - consistently solving the dmft equations , we can extract the momentum - dependent lesser green function and use eq .",
    "( [ jalpha2 ] ) to find the current . in these calculations",
    ", we used the green functions in a particular gauge , but one could easily shift to the gauge - invariant green functions if desired . when the field is small , and the correlations are small , we see a damping of the bloch oscillations , as expected .",
    "this is shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "one can see that the bloch oscillations maintain their periodicity , but are damped as the scattering increases .",
    "as we start to approach the metal - insulator transition at @xmath139 , one can see the character of the oscillations start to change .",
    "as we move into the insulating phase , as shown in the right panel , the character of the oscillations changes completely , and we no longer see the regular bloch structure . the oscillations seem to survive to much longer times than would be expected from a boltzmann equation type of analysis .",
    "it remains unclear whether the steady state has some residual oscillations , or it goes to a constant value as predicted by semiclassical ideas .",
    "even more surprising is the fact that when the field is large , the current displays two anomalous features : ( i ) first , its decay is much slower than expected from a semiclassical approach , where the relaxation time is inversely proportional to the imaginary part of the self - energy at the chemical potential , which is proportional to @xmath140 and ( ii ) the current develops beats with a beat frequency proportional to @xmath141 .",
    "an example of this behavior is shown in fig .",
    "[ beatings ] .",
    "these beats are always present in the metallic phases ( for large @xmath14 ) , but disappear once one moves into the insulator .",
    "the time - dependence of the density of states can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ at ] ) . here , we present some results for the case when the system is initially in the metallic phase , fig .",
    "[ fig : dos_u=0.5_e=1 ] .",
    "what we find is that for small fields , the delta function peaks of the wannier - stark ladder get broadened , but the structure is still readily apparent . but as we increase the field strength , the behavior qualitatively changes , and in the long - time limit , the system evolves into a peaked structure , where the peaks are maximal near the edges of minibands , which are spaced apart in size by @xmath14 , and the dos has a local minimum in the center , where the wannier - stark peak used to appear .",
    "this is also behavior that is quite surprising .    as the scattering increases ,",
    "the dos approaches the steady state value relatively quickly .",
    "this illustrates the dichotomy between the average time , which is important for determining the current , and the relative time , which is important for determining the dos .",
    "the decay is rapid as a function of relative time , but is much slower as a function of average time .",
    "a perturbative analysis can be performed directly on the lattice@xcite . in this case",
    ", we do not need any dmft loop , and we can restrict the contour to be solely on the real axis .",
    "as described above , the perturbation theory is similar for the equilibrium and nonequilibrium cases , with the only significant changes being that one needs to calculate with time - ordered objects along the contour and one needs to use noninteracting green functions in the field .",
    "a strictly truncated expansion for the self - energy to second order in @xmath14 is equal to the usual hartree - fock term ( which vanishes at half filling ) plus a second - order term which satisfies @xmath142 one can determine the retarded and lesser self - energies from this in a straightforward fashion .",
    "it turns out that this truncated perturbation theory is most accurate at short times  in essence , the perturbation series expansion is an expansion in a power series in time away from the time the field was turned on . in more conventional perturbation series in terms of frequency - dependent green functions ,",
    "the perturbation series is most accurate at high frequencies , and least accurate at low frequencies . after performing a fourier transform",
    ", one can immediately see that this is equivalent to the perturbation theory being most accurate at short times and breaking down at long times .",
    "indeed , we find that this perturbative treatment can not reproduce the steady - state behavior at long times .    as a benchmark of our calculation , we compare the equilibrium self - energy found from a numerical solution of the dmft equations to the perturbative result for small @xmath14 .",
    "we find quite good agreement in the small-@xmath14 range , and the equilibrium case appears to be fairly accurate up to @xmath143 .",
    "for larger @xmath14 values the perturbation theory breaks down  it is not capable of properly describing the mott - insulating phase .",
    "next we analyze the time - dependence of the electric current calculated by second order perturbation theory in the case when a constant electric field is turned on at time @xmath45 . before presenting the second - order perturbative solution for the current , we briefly review the corresponding results from a semiclassical boltzmann equation approximation . as was mentioned above",
    ", these results are qualitatively different from the exact solution .    in the boltzmann equation approach ,",
    "one introduces a nonequilibrium quasiparticle distribution function @xmath144 , which satisfies the following phenomenological equation : @xmath145 , \\label{boltzmann}\\ ] ] with the boundary condition : @xmath146 + 1 } .",

    "substitution of the expression for the distribution function instead of @xmath147 into eq .",
    "( [ jalpha2 ] ) allows one to calculate the semiclassical current .",
    "this semiclassical current approaches a steady state as time goes to infinity . in particular ,",
    "in the infinite - dimensional limit one obtains : @xmath148 .",
    "\\label{jboltzmannsol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] therefore , the current is a strongly oscillating function of time for @xmath149 , and it approaches the steady - state value @xmath150 where @xmath151 as @xmath152 .",
    "the steady - state current amplitude is proportional to @xmath153 in the case of a weak field ( the linear - response regime ) , and then becomes proportional to @xmath154 at @xmath155 .",
    "the amplitude of the current goes to zero in this nonlinear regime with the field amplitude increasing .",
    "one would naively expect that the second - order perturbation theory would give similar results in the case of a weak coulomb repulsion , since one can extract an effective scattering time for the equilibrium limit of the falicov - kimball model with small @xmath14 : @xmath156 @xcite .",
    "however , it will be shown below , that the behavior of the current calculated in second - order perturbation theory is rather different from the boltzmann equation case , and closer to the exact numerical result at short times .",
    "the electric current in the second - order perturbation theory can be calculated by substituting the expression for the second - order lesser green function into eq .",

    "@xmath157 g_{\\epsilon , { \\bar \\varepsilon}}^{<}(t , t).\\nonumber \\\\ \\label{j2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is difficult to find exact analytical expressions for the current , except for some limiting cases .",
    "of course , in the limit @xmath158 we recover the free electron case result : @xmath159 where the amplitude @xmath160 of the bloch oscillations is given by eq .",
    "( [ j0 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the general expression for the time - dependence of the electric current in a strictly truncated second - order perturbation theory expansion can be written as : @xmath161 the electric current is a superposition of an oscillating part and some other piece proportional to @xmath162 .",
    "obviously this can not produce a constant steady - state current for all small @xmath14 , because the function @xmath163 is independent of @xmath14 .",
    "this is a clear indication that the perturbation theory will hold only for short times .",
    "numerical results for the time - dependence of the electric current calculated from eq .",
    "( [ j2 ] ) at @xmath164 and different values of @xmath14 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] ( dashed lines ) .",
    "note how the current oscillates for all times within our finite time window .",
    "we also show the corresponding boltzmann equation solution and the exact solution .",
    "we use two different values for the boltzmann equation ",
    "one fixes the relaxation time to the prediction from the equilibrium solution , while the other adjusts the relaxation time to obtain the best fit .",
    "comparison of the perturbation theory and the boltzmann equation solution shows that they are close at short times , but at longer times the pt current remains oscillating , while the boltzmann equation solution approaches a steady state .",
    "moreover , at times longer than @xmath165 the perturbation theory breaks down showing an oscillating current with increasing amplitude . at times shorter than @xmath166 the perturbation theory solution is close to the exact result , displaying an oscillating current with decreasing amplitude .",
    "it is also possible to fit the boltzmann equation results to the exact and pt solution at short times if one chooses the relaxation time @xmath167 , where @xmath168 , which is much larger than @xmath169 in the case of the second order perturbation theory@xcite .",
    "these results clearly show that the semiclassical approach , with one effective time variable that is damped on the timescale of the relaxation time is not sufficient to describe the behavior in the quantum case .",
    "the perturbation theory calculations at different values of the electric field give results similar to the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : current ] .",
    "numerical analysis shows that the agreement between the perturbation theory results and the exact results is better when @xmath132 is larger than @xmath14 .",

    ", we have presented some results on the nonequilibrium properties of the falicov - kimball model of strongly correlated electrons in the limit of infinite dimensions . despite the simplicity of the model ,",
    "the solutions show that strong electron - electron correlations result in nontrivial behavior .",
