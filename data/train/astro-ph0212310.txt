    "the joint observations of gravitational lensing , high redshift type ia supernova , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and cluster abundances constrain the universe to be in all likelihood flat and accelerating , with the present mass density being composed of about 70% cosmological constant ( or dark energy ) , 26% dark matter , and 4% ordinary matter @xcite .",
    "however , the lensing cross - section ( and thus the lensing probability ) is found to be extremely sensitive to the inner density profile of lenses ( keeton & madau 2001 ; wyithe , turner , & spergel 2001 ; lo02 ) .",
    "for example , with fixed total mass , when the inner slope of the density profile , @xmath8 , changes from @xmath9 [ the nfw case @xcite ] to @xmath10 [ the singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) case @xcite ] while maintaining the same mass density in lenses , the integral lensing probability increases by more than two orders of magnitudes for the flat model of the universe ( lo02 ) . therefore , lensing also sensitively probes small scale structure .",
    "this complicates matters and renders it is hazardous to use observed lensing statistics to draw inferences with regard to cosmology before determining the sensitivity to other factors .    in lo02",
    ", we have shown that in order to explain the observed numbers of lenses found in the jvas / class survey , at least two populations of dark halos must exist in nature .",
    "one population , which corresponds to normal galaxies , has masses @xmath11 and a steep inner density profile ( @xmath12 , i.e. sis ) presumably determined by the distribution of baryonic material in the inner parts of galaxies ; the other one , which corresponds to groups or clusters of galaxies , has masses @xmath13 and a shallow inner density profile ( @xmath14 , i.e. similar to nfw ) . a similar conclusion has been obtained by @xcite for explaining the number of lenses found in the castles survey .",
    "these results are consistent with the theoretical studies on the cooling of massive gas clouds : there is a critical mass of halos @xmath15 below which cooling of the corresponding baryonic component will lead to concentration of the baryons to the inner parts of the mass profile @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the lensing statistics produced by a compound population of halos .",
    "we assume that there are three populations of halos in the universe :     population a : @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( sis ) ; +  population b : @xmath18 , @xmath19 [ gnfw ( generalized nfw , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ] ; +  population c : @xmath20 , @xmath19 ( gnfw ) ,    where @xmath21 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km s@xmath22 mpc@xmath22 . population a corresponds to spiral and elliptical galaxies , whose centers are dominated by baryonic matter .",
    "population b corresponds to groups or clusters of galaxies , whose centers are dominated by dark matter .",
    "population c corresponds to dwarf galaxies or subgalactic objects , whose centers lack baryons due to feedback processes such as supernova explosions , stellar winds , and photoionizations @xcite , and so are also dominated by dark matter .",
    "we adopt an inner slope for the dark matter halos of @xmath19 consistent with the value @xmath23 found by @xcite and intermediate between the values advocated by @xcite of @xmath24 and @xcite of @xmath25 .",
    "we will calculate here the lensing probability of two measurable variables : image separation and time delay , examining in a subsequent paper the expected arc properties .",
    "recently , @xcite used lensing statistics to constrain the inner slope of lensing galaxies . using the schechter function @xcite",
    ", they constrained the inner slope of lensing galaxies to the range from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , at 95% confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "it is hard to predict how their result would change if the press - schechter function @xcite were used .",
    "our choice of @xmath17 for galaxies is supported by the following fact : stellar dynamics of elliptical galaxies , modeling of lensed systems , and flux ratios of multiple images all give an inner profile that is consistent with sis @xcite .",
    "@xcite have reported a remarkably flat inner slope in the lensing cluster ms2137 - 23 : @xmath28 at 99% cl .",
    "however , by measuring the average gravitational shear profile of six massive clusters of virial masses @xmath29 , @xcite have found that the data are well fitted by a mass density profile with @xmath30 for scdm model and @xmath31 for lcdm model , both at 68% cl .",
    "so , our choice of @xmath19 for population b looks reasonable .",
    "the inner density slopes for small mass halos are not well constrained .",
    "cdm simulations generally predict a cusped inner density , while other dark matter models , like warm dark matter @xcite , repulsive dark matter @xcite , and collisional dark matter @xcite , tend to predict flatter inner density ( see also ricotti 2002 ) . our choice of @xmath19 for population c should be a reasonable upper limit . in her recent paper , by requiring that the schechter luminosity function and the press - schechter mass function to give consistent predictions for the image separation below @xmath32 ,",
    "@xcite has shown that the fraction of sis halos peaks around mass of @xmath33 and quickly drops for large and small mass halos .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the model that we adopt in this paper .",

    "we show how to calculate the lensing probability , assuming that halos are composed of the population defined above , whose mass function is given by the press - schechter function @xcite . in  [ sec4 ] we present our results . in  [ sec5 ] we summarize and discuss our results .",
    "issues related to image separation are presented in lo02 in detail , so here we focus on the time delay between multiple images produced by gravitational lensing .",

    "consistent with the results in lo02 , the lensing probability produced by the @xmath106 gnfw halos is smaller than the lensing probability produced by sis halos by two orders of magnitudes in the overlap regions .",

[ [ c1 ] ] . )    in figure  [ fig2 ] , we show the lcdm ( @xmath84 , @xmath107 ) results corresponding to different redshift of the source object : from @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "we see that the lensing probability increases quickly with the source redshift , increasing by an order of magnitude between @xmath110 and @xmath111 ( cf .",
    "wambsganss , bode , & ostriker 2003 ) . however , the rate of increase in the lensing probability decreases with the source redshift , this is because that the proper distance from the source object to the observer approaches a finite limit as @xmath112 ( due to the existence of a horizon in an expanding universe ) .",
    "we also see that , as the source redshift increases , the splitting angle corresponding to the peak probability of each island shifts toward larger values . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , we show the corresponding integral lensing probability @xmath113    to compare the predictions with observations , the effect of magnification bias must be considered ( turner , ostriker , & gott 1984 ; schneider , ehlers , & falco 1992 ; lo02 ; oguri et al .",
    "2002 ) . when the source objects have a flux distribution @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) and the probability density for magnification is @xmath116 , the magnification bias is given by ( lo02 ) @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the minimum of the total amplification .",
    "for sis lenses we have @xmath119 .",
    "for gnfw lenses , @xmath118 can be approximated by @xmath120 where @xmath121 .",
    "equation  ( [ amnfw ] ) is an improvement to the equation ( 68 ) of lo02",
    ". the magnification bias calculated with equations  ( [ bias ] ) and ( [ amnfw ] ) agrees with that calculated with the more complicated formula of @xcite with errors @xmath122 for @xmath123 .    for gnfw lenses with @xmath19 , we show the average magnification bias @xmath124 ( defined by the ratio of the biased lensing probability to that without bias ) as a function of image separation in figure  [ fig4a ] ( as an improvement to the fig .  10 of lo02 ) for the jvas / class survey @xcite , where we have assumed @xmath125 @xcite and @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "the magnification bias for gnfw lenses depends on cosmological models , decreases with increasing image separation , and is bigger than the magnification bias for sis lenses ( which is a constant @xmath127 ) by about @xmath128 order of magnitude on average ( for @xmath129 ) .    in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    ", we compare our predictions ( including magnification bias ) for the compound model with observations from the jvas / class survey .",
    "the data are updated compared to @xcite .",
    "the new data contain @xmath130 lenses found in a sample of @xmath131 of radio sources which form a statistical sample @xcite .",
    "considering error bars , both lcdm and ocdm models with both normalizations are marginally consistent with the jvas / class observational data . @xcite . ] comparing lcdm2 with lcdm3 , we find that even for the same cluster normalization there is significant discriminatory power available from lensing statistics ( if data is available ) in breaking the degeneracy on the @xmath132 plane .",
    "this is consistent with our previous results ( lo02 ) .",
    "the three different lcdm models do not differ significantly in their predictions at small splittings but for splittings above 10 arcseconds the bahcall et al normalization , lcdm3 , predicts few lenses by more than a factor of five .      for time delay , we have calculated the differential lensing probability @xmath133 where @xmath134 is given by equation  ( [ ip ] ) with @xmath135 .",
    "we show the results in figure  [ fig5 ] , for the same models in  [ sec4.1 ] .",
    "we see that , the distribution of lensing probability over time delay is very similar to the distribution over image separation ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "again , the contribution to lensing events is overwhelmingly dominated by population a due to its steep inner density slope .",
    "population c contributes the least .",
    "we have also calculated the lensing probability for time delay corresponding to different source redshift : from @xmath108 to @xmath109 .",
    "the results for the lcdm model ( @xmath84 , @xmath136 ) are shown in figure  [ fig6 ] for the differential lensing probability @xmath137 , and figure  [ fig7 ] for the integral lensing probability @xmath138 from these figures we see that , like in the case for image separation , the lensing probability sensitively depends on @xmath66 for small @xmath66 . for large @xmath66",
    ", the lensing probability becomes less sensitive to the source redshift , due to the fact that @xmath139 decreases with increasing @xmath66 .",
    "we can calculate the joint lensing probability @xmath140 by using the joint cross - section @xmath141 where @xmath142 for sis and @xmath143 for gnfw .",
    "the cross - section @xmath144 is given by equation  ( 37 ) of lo02 for sis , and equation  ( 48 ) of lo02 for gnfw .",
    "then , we can calculate the conditional lensing probability @xmath145 defined by @xmath146 which gives the distribution of lensing events over time delay for a given image separation .",
    "knowing @xmath145 , we can calculate the median time delay @xmath147 as a function of @xmath148 , where @xmath147 is defined by @xmath149 the prediction for @xmath147 as a function of @xmath148 is not sensitive to the magnification bias since it is determined by the ratio of two probabilities .",
    "so , the correlation between @xmath150 and @xmath148 provides a test of lensing models independent of the determination of magnification bias .",
    "the results of @xmath151 for the lcdm ( @xmath152 , @xmath136 ; indeed the results are insensitive to the cosmological parameters ) model are shown in figure [ fig8 ] , where the source object is again assumed to be at @xmath153 . in figure  [ fig8 ] we also show the quadrant deviations ( dashed lines ) , which are defined by equation  ( [ med ] ) with the @xmath154 on the right - hand side being replaced by @xmath155 and @xmath156 , respectively .",
    "the observational data , taken from @xcite , fit the lcdm model well .",
    "comparison of figure  [ fig8 ] with @xcite s figure  6 indicates that our compound model fits the observations better .",
    "the single population model predicts a single ( almost ) straight line in the @xmath157 space . for the compound model ,",
    "a `` step '' is produced at the point where the mass density profile changes .",
    "the `` step '' that we see in figure  [ fig8 ] corresponds to the transition from population a ( galaxies ) to population b ( galaxy groups / clusters ) .",
    "as an extension of our previous work ( lo02 ) , we computed the lensing probability produced by a compound population of dark halos .",
    "we have calculated the lensing probability for both image separation and time delay .",
    "the calculations confirm our previous results ( lo02 ) that the lensing probability produced by gnfw halos with @xmath158 is lower than that produced by sis halos with same masses by orders of magnitudes , where @xmath159 is the inner slope of the halo mass density .",
    "so , for the compound population of halos , both the number of lenses with large image separation ( @xmath160 ) and the number of lenses with small image separation ( @xmath161 ) are greatly suppressed .",
    "the same conclusion holds also for the number of lenses with large time delay ( @xmath162 ) and the number of lenses with small time delay ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig5 ] .",
    "this conclusion holds even when the effect of magnification bias is considered , see figs .",
    "[ fig4a ] and [ fig4 ] . )",
    "we have also tested the dependence of the lensing probability on the redshift of the source object ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] , [ fig3 ] , [ fig6 ] , and [ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the results show that , the lensing probability is quite sensitive to the change in the redshift of the source object .",
    "the number of lenses significantly increases as the source redshift increases .",
    "however , the rate of the increase decreases as the source redshift becomes large , which is caused by the fact that the proper cosmological distance approaches a finite limit when @xmath164 .",
    "another interesting result is that , the peak of the lensing probability for each population moves toward large image separation or time delay , as the source redshift increases .    we see that population c ( dwarf halos ) in an lcdm model has a unique signature in the time domain , c.f .",
    "figures  [ fig5 ] and [ fig6 ] .",
    "time delays of less than @xmath165 seconds and greater than 0.1 second are predicted and should be found in gamma - ray burst sources which are at cosmological distances and have the requisite temporal substructure .",
    "variants of cdm , such as warm dark matter @xcite , repulsive dark matter @xcite , or collisional dark matter @xcite would not produce this feature .",
    "however , current surveys do not go deep enough to provide a sufficiently large sample to test the prediction .",
    "when more observational data on gamma - ray burst time delay and small splitting angles become available , our calculations can be used to distinguish different dark matter models @xcite .",
    "we have compared the distribution of the number of lenses over image separation predicted by our model with the updated jvas / class observational data , with the new _ wmap _ cosmological parameters ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "since the jvas / class survey is limited to image separation @xmath166 @xcite , we can not test our predictions for small image separations .",
    "however , in the range that is probed by jvas / class , we see that both the lcdm and ocdm models fit the observation reasonably well and current data do not allow us to distinguish between the two proposed normalizations for the lcdm spectrum , even though these produce predictions that differ by a factor of roughly @xmath167 .",
    "an explicit search for lenses with image separation between @xmath168 and @xmath169 has found no lenses @xcite , which rules out the sis model for image separation in this range ( lo02 ) .",

    "the compound model predicts a unique feature in the @xmath157 plane : there is a `` step '' corresponding to the transition in mass density profile .",
    "this can be better tested when more observation data are available .",
