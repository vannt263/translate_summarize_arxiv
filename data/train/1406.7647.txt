    "we examine bps lump equations in each branch .",
    "we first focus on the canonical branch associated with the solution .",
    "hopfions in the supersymmetric higher derivative @xmath46 model of this type were discussed before @xcite .",
    "bps lumps in the supersymmetric higher derivative @xmath46 model were discussed in ref .",
    "bps lumps in the higher derivative @xmath148 non - linear sigma models were discussed in a different context without supersymmetry @xcite .    in this branch ,",
    "the bps lump equation is obtained by imposing the first condition in on the spinor @xmath114 , as can be seen in , e.g. , refs .",
    "then , the bps equation for lumps is given by @xcite @xmath149 this is nothing but the ordinary 1/2 bps lump condition .",
    "this is confirmed by the bogomolnyi bound of the energy density . for the canonical branch",
    ", we have the energy density @xmath150 where we have assumed the condition @xmath151 for the positive - semi definiteness of the energy @xmath152 .",
    "the right hand side is nothing but the topological charge density for the 1/2 bps lump .",
    "the energy bound is saturated provided the condition is satisfied .",
    "then we find that the higher derivative corrections to the solutions and the energy bound are canceled out in this branch .",
    "it is confirmed that solutions to the equation satisfy the full equation of motion for the scalar field . when we consider the fubini - study metric for the @xmath8 model and take the function @xmath41",
    "as @xmath153 the bound becomes just the bps bound obtained in the context of the effective theory on a non - abelian vortex @xcite .    in summary , although the lagrangian contains higher derivative corrections , the 1/2 bps lump solution to the equation ( which is a holomorphic function with appropriate boundary conditions ) does not receive any corrections in the canonical branch .",
    "we next consider the non - canonical branch . since this is associated with the @xmath128 solution even for @xmath30 , we need to impose both of the two conditions in in order to obtain the bps equation from the variation of the fermion",
    ". then the bps equation is @xmath154 where @xmath155 is a phase factor .",
    "this is the 1/4 bps equation .",
    "again , the bps lump does not cancel the higher derivative corrections generally .",

    "it is obvious that the expression of the topological charge is not corrected by the higher derivative terms .    in the non - canonical branch",
    ", the lagrangian does not contain ordinary canonical kinetic term .",
    "an example of such a kind of non - canonical model is the extremal ( bps ) baby skyrme model .",

    "the model is governed by a ( 2,2 ) khler tensor @xmath159 symmetric in holomorphic and anti - holomorphic indices , in addition to the khler potential @xmath19 and the superpotential @xmath20 .",
    "they are functions of the chiral superfields @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , the tensor @xmath159 determines the higher derivative interactions of the models .",
    "a specific feature of the model is that the auxiliary fields @xmath17 do not have space - time derivatives on them and can be eliminated by their equation of motion algebraically .",
    "one can explicitly write down the on - shell lagrangian of the model at least for a single chiral superfield . since the equation of motion for the auxiliary fields is no longer a linear equation",

    "when there is no superpotential , there are two distinct on - shell branches .",

    "we have exhibited the explicit function @xmath41 which corresponds to the supersymmetric extension of the faddeev - skyrme model without four time derivatives , which is in contrast to the previous studies @xcite concluding that such a term is necessary for supersymmetry .",
    "the other branch is the non - canonical one corresponding to the solution @xmath128 . in this branch",
    ", the ordinary canonical kinetic term disappears and the lagrangian starts from the forth order derivative terms .",

    "there are three on - shell branches associated with the three different solutions of the auxiliary field equation @xcite .",
    "the resulting on - shell lagrangians have highly non - linear expressions .",
    "perturbative analysis reveals the possibility of ghost kinetic terms and deformations of the scalar potential .    even though the on - shell lagrangian is complicated and becomes highly non - linear in the @xmath81 case",

    "these conditions are supplemented by the equation of motion for the auxiliary field giving rise to the on - shell conditions .",

    "the solution is deformed by the higher derivative effects and it is confirmed that the solution satisfies the full equation of motion .",
    "the expression of the energy bound is shown to be the same as the ordinary ( without higher derivative terms ) theory , namely , the sum of the junction charge and the tension . for lump configurations in the @xmath30 case , there are two on - shell bps equations .",
    "one is the 1/2 bps lumps associated with the @xmath160 solution , where all the derivative corrections are canceled out .",
    "the other is the 1/4 bps lumps associated with the @xmath128 solution .",
    "the on - shell bps equation is deformed by the higher derivative corrections .",
    "this is nothing but the equation studied in ref .",
    "an example of solutions to this equation is compactons in the extremal ( bps ) baby skyrme model .",
    "while we were able to solve explicitly auxiliary field equations ( [ eq : af - eom ] ) only for one chiral superfield , reducing the third order algebraic equation ( [ eq : af - eom2 ] ) , the multicomponent equation ( [ eq : af - eom ] ) has yet to be solved .",
    "when the target space has a large isometry , it should be possible to solve it .",
    "construction of more general target spaces , for instance a higher derivative @xmath161 model and its bps solitons remains as a future problem .",
    "while we have exhausted all bps states that are already known in conventional @xmath48 supersymmetric theories without higher derivatives , there may still remain unknown bps states particular for higher derivative theories .",
