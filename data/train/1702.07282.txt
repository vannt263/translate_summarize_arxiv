    "the arecibo legacy fast alfa survey ( alfalfa ) is a blind neutral hydrogen ( hi ) survey carried out with the arecibo radio telescope that covers @xmath77000 square degrees of sky and has cataloged more than 30,000 sources , the majority of which have never before been observed in the 21-cm line @xcite .",
    "alfalfa detects sources with @xmath8 m@xmath9 of hi  at the distance of the virgo cluster and @xmath10 m@xmath9 within the local group at an angular resolution of @xmath73.5@xmath11 and a spectral resolution of @xmath12 km  s@xmath13 @xcite . among these thousands of alfalfa sources",
    "is a small population of objects first identified according to their common characteristics by @xcite and dubbed ultra - compact high velocity clouds ( uchvcs ) .",
    "the uchvcs are very compact ( @xmath14  diameter ) , isolated gas clouds that have hi  properties ( including narrow velocity widths ) that suggest they may be nearby low - mass galaxies .",
    "the other important characteristic of uchvcs is that they have no clear optical counterpart when their positions and redshifts are checked against optical surveys and catalogs like the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; * ? ? ? * ) and sources in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) .",
    "some have argued that compact high - velocity clouds ( chvcs , with @xmath760  diameters ) detected in hi  surveys are gas clouds in the local group with few or no stars , embedded within low - mass dark matter halos @xcite .",
    "the detection of a substantial population of such objects would have implications for the `` missing satellites problem '' , the discrepancy between the numbers of low - mass halos predicted by @xmath15cdm structure formation models compared to the numbers detected in observational surveys @xcite .",
    "however @xcite demonstrated that the structural properties of the chvcs do not match the expected properties of the missing satellites in the @xmath15cdm framework : if extragalactic , they are physically too large .",
    "@xcite brought renewed attention to this topic by showing that uchvcs discovered in alfalfa , if they are indeed at distances of @xmath71 mpc , _ do _ have sizes and masses consistent with their being baryonic material embedded within low - mass ( @xmath16  m@xmath9 ) dark matter halos , or `` minihalos '' , that fit within the @xmath15cdm paradigm .",
    "@xcite concluded that the uchvcs are plausible minihalo candidates , but exactly what they represent ",
    "e.g. , starless gas clouds , low - mass galaxies with stars that have been missed by past surveys , or some other poorly - understood hvc phenomenon  remains unclear .",
    "a preliminary list of 27 uchvcs was presented in @xcite , and @xcite followed up with a more complete list of 59 objects chosen from the 40% alfalfa catalog @xcite .",
    "uchvcs selected from alfalfa have hi  properties like those of leo  t @xcite , which is the faintest ( @xmath17 ) local group dwarf galaxy with evidence of recent star formation . at a distance of 1 mpc",
    ", the uchvcs would have hi  masses of @xmath710@xmath18@xmath1910@xmath20 @xmath21 , hi  diameters of @xmath72@xmath193 kpc , and dynamical masses of @xmath710@xmath22@xmath1910@xmath23 @xmath21 .    in order to derive the masses and sizes of these hi  sources , and thus to better understand their nature",
    ", we need to know their distances .",
    "one route for deriving distances for the uchvcs is to detect their stellar populations , construct a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , and then measure a distance from the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) method .",
    "accordingly , we are carrying out a campaign to obtain deep optical imaging of uchvcs with the wiyn 3.5-m telescope to look for stellar populations associated with these objects , and ( if possible ) derive their distances , masses , sizes , and other properties , and to study their star formation histories .",
    "the first uchvc we observed with wiyn resulted in the discovery of leo  p , an extremely metal - poor gas - rich star - forming dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "located just outside the local group at @xmath24 mpc @xcite , leo  p has an hi  mass of @xmath25 @xmath21  and an hi - to - stellar mass ratio of @xmath72 .",
    "its oxygen abundance is @xmath72% of the solar value , comparable to the abundances of i zw 18 , ddo 68 , and the alfalfa galaxy agc  198691 @xcite .",
    "its total magnitude is @xmath26 and its dynamical mass is @xmath27 @xmath21 , making leo p the lowest - mass galaxy known that is currently forming stars .    since the discovery of leo  p",
    ", we have developed a systematic observing strategy and procedure for searching for stellar counterparts to the uchvcs .",
    "details are presented in @xcite , along with a tentative detection of a counterpart to the alfalfa source agc  198606 , nicknamed `` friend of leo  t '' @xcite because it is close in position and velocity to dwarf galaxy leo  t. we detected a stellar counterpart at a distance of @xmath7380 kpc , with @xmath28 , and an hi - to - stellar mass ratio of @xmath29 . because our detection has only 92% significance ,",
    "additional observations are needed to show unambiguously whether or not this object is a real detection and a new local group member .",
    "other groups are also carrying out optical searches for counterparts to the alfalfa uchvcs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results from these searches , as well as from the wiyn imaging obtained thus far , suggest that if nearby stellar counterparts to uchvcs can be found , they will much less obvious than leo  p. this is not unexpected since alfalfa sources are , as mentioned , not classified as uchvcs unless they have no clear optical counterpart in extant surveys .",
    "our campaign to obtain and process wiyn imaging of uchvcs is underway .",
    "we draw our targets from @xcite as well as from the 70% alfalfa catalog @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we present the possible detection of a stellar population associated with the uchvc agc  249525 , which is included in the 70% catalog and was characterized as an excellent dwarf galaxy candidate by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter a16 ) based on its hi  distribution and evidence of rotation in follow - up hi  synthesis observations .",
    "presented results from westerbork radio synthesis telescope ( wrst ) observations of several uchvcs .",
    "agc  249525 shows a smooth hi  morphology at improved ( 60 , 105 ) angular resolution and ordered motion consistent with @xmath715 km s@xmath13  rotation .",
    "agc  249525 , and the aforementioned agc  198606 , are among the highest column density objects in the uchvc sample , with peak @xmath30 atoms @xmath31 at 105  resolution . reported a mean hi  angular diameter at half - flux level of 8.5  for agc  249525 and an hi  mass of @xmath32 , assuming a distance of 1 mpc .",
    "showed that for a distance range of 0.4@xmath192 mpc , and assuming a baryonic mass consisting of only the neutral gas component , agc  249525 falls on the baryonic tully - fisher relation @xcite when it is extrapolated to low galaxy masses .",
    "we observed agc  249525 with the partially - filled one degree imager ( podi ) on the wiyn 3.5-m telescope at kitt peak national observatory on 16 march 2013 .",
    "the podi camera provided a @xmath724  @xmath33  field of view and a pixel scale of 011 per pixel .",
    "nine 300s exposures were obtained in @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters .",
    "the raw images were transferred to the odi portal , pipeline , and archive ( odi - ppa ) at indiana university and processed using the quickreduce pipeline @xcite to remove the instrumental signature .",
    "we then illumination - corrected , scaled , and stacked the images .",
    "the fwhm of the point spread function in the stacked images is 078 in @xmath1 and 073 in @xmath2 .",
    "sources were identified with the iraf task ` daofind ` and the source lists in @xmath1 and @xmath2 were matched .",
    "we performed photometry and calculated final , calibrated @xmath34 and @xmath35 magnitudes for all point sources in the matched list .",
    "photometric calibration coefficients were calculated based on sdss dr13 @xcite standard stars in the images and galactic extinction corrections were calculated using the relations in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath36 detection limit is 25.5 in @xmath1 and 24.5 in @xmath2 .",
    "the full details of our analysis methods are given in @xcite .",
    "briefly , we constructed a cmd from the @xmath34 and @xmath35 photometry and then applied a color - magnitude filter derived from @xcite isochrones to the data , sampling a set of distances between 0.3 and 2.5 mpc .",
    "the cmd filter is intended to select red giant branch ( rgb ) stars and horizontal branch ( hb ) stars from old , metal - poor stellar populations .",
    "we then smoothed the spatial distribution of the filtered stars by binning the positions into a 2-dimensional grid with @xmath37 bin sizes , and convolving the grid with a gaussian distribution with a 3  smoothing radius .",
    "overdensities are regions in the grid that exceed the mean grid value by some number of standard deviations ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "to quantify the significance of the overdensities , we created 25000 samples with the same number of points as were found in the cmd filter , but with a uniform random distribution .",
    "we measured the peak @xmath38 value for each of these samples .",
    "the distribution is well - fitted by a lognormal probability distribution function . to identify significant overdensities",
    ", we calculated the percentage of the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of peak @xmath38 values below that of the overdensity detected in the real data .",
    "we consider an overdensity significant if it has a peak @xmath38 value higher than 95% or more of the values in the simulated cdf .",
    "based on the analysis described above , we found significant stellar overdensities in the agc  249525 images at a range of distances between 1.35 mpc and 2.08 mpc . in figure",
    "[ fig : detection ] , we show the results of the cmd filtering and smoothing process for the highest - significance detection at 1.64 mpc @xmath39 . we adopt the distance corresponding to this detection as our assumed distance to the object .",
    "we estimate an uncertainty of @xmath30.45 mpc , based on the observed range of significant ( @xmath4095% ) overdensities that show up at that location . in figure",
    "[ fig : significance ] , we show the results of the significance testing for the detection at 1.64 mpc . at this distance , 98.4% of peak overdensities in the random realizations",
    "are weaker than the peak overdensity in the data , indicating that the overdensity is unlikely to be a random clustering of sources .     for the overdensity shown in figure [ fig : detection ] .",
    "the @xmath38 value for the overdensity is greater than 98.4% of peak sigma values in 25,000 random realizations .",
    "[ fig : significance ] ]    figure [ fig : contours ] shows the @xmath2 image overlaid with the hi  contours from the wsrt data presented in .",
    "the location of the stellar overdensity , marked by a magenta circle , is coincident with the highest hi  contour level , providing further evidence that the stellar overdensity is associated with the uchvc .",
    "another check on the validity of the overdensity of rgb stars in the center of the agc  249525 field is shown in figure [ fig : cmdgrid ] .",
    "we divided the image into regions 44 @xmath41 44 in size and plotted the cmd for each portion of the image .",
    "the central region shows an increased number of stars at @xmath42 , consistent with the colors of rgb stars in our cmd filter . when visualized in this way , the overdensity of potential rgb stars in the center of the image is readily apparent .",
    "we note that a modest overdensity appears in the northwest corner of the image ( top right of figure [ fig : cmdgrid ] ) .",
    "the peak @xmath38 value for this overdensity is greater than the peak value in only 2% of the random realizations , so it is not significant .",
    "we can use the 1.64 mpc distance to calculate the hi  properties of agc  249525 . combining the values",
    "presented in with our distance yields an hi  mass of @xmath43 @xmath44 , an hi  radius atoms @xmath31 level . ]",
    "of @xmath45 kpc , and a dynamical mass of @xmath46 @xmath44 .",
    "to calculate the observed properties of the optical counterpart , we masked all objects in the images that are obvious background galaxies or foreground stars .",
    "we then measured the magnitude in the masked images within a circular aperture of radius 75 , centered on the location of the highest - density peak in figure [ fig : detection ] .",
    "the 75  radius was chosen to minimize contributions from sky background fluctuations while maximizing the number of stars that fell within the cmd filter .",
    "this process yielded apparent magnitudes of @xmath47 and @xmath48 and a @xmath49 color of @xmath50 . at a distance of 1.64 mpc",
    ", this corresponds to an absolute magnitude of @xmath51 .",
    "because these values include all unmasked light inside the 75  radius aperture , including fluctuations in the sky background , they should be considered upper limits .",
    "we also compute lower limit magnitudes by summing the flux from only those sources selected by the cmd filter that are inside the 75-radius circle around the stellar overdensity peak . in this case",
    "we find apparent magnitudes of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , with a @xmath49 color of @xmath54 . at a distance of 1.64 mpc ,",
    "the `` minimum '' absolute magnitude of agc  249525 is @xmath55 .",
    "although extremely faint compared to most dwarf galaxies , these absolute magnitudes are consistent with the range of values for ultra - faint dwarfs ( ufds ) in the local group and its environs @xcite .",
    "we can use the distance to compute an hi - to - stellar mass ratio for this object .",
    "we begin by estimating the stellar mass - to - light ratio using the relations from @xcite , finding for the redder , brighter magnitude limit a value of @xmath56 , and for the bluer , fainter magnitude limit a value of @xmath57 . using these mass - to - light ratios",
    "we calculate a stellar luminosity of @xmath58 and a stellar mass of @xmath59 for the bright limit , and a luminosity of @xmath60 and mass of @xmath61 for the faint limit . using an hi  mass of @xmath62 , we find hi - to - stellar mass ratios of @xmath63 for the bright limit and @xmath64 for the faint limit .",
    "the hi  and optical properties are listed in table [ tab : props ] .",
    "discuss the potential close neighbors of agc  249525 : bootes i , bootes ii , and ugc  9128 .",
    "bootes i and bootes ii are both located within 60 kpc of the sun , and so are not in close spatial proximity to agc  249525 . at the distance",
    "we have estimated here , the most likely neighbor is the galaxy ugc  9128 at 2.27 mpc @xcite .",
    "ugc  9128 has a @xmath65 km s@xmath13  @xcite and is less than 10  away from agc  249525 , which has a @xmath66 km s@xmath13  .",

    "the possible detection of an optical counterpart for the uchvc agc  249525 has interesting implications .",
    "along with agc198606 @xcite , it would represent one of the most extreme galaxies in or near the local group , with its sparse stellar population and large @xmath76 ratio .",
    "while galaxies like these are difficult to detect , models have predicted that they should exist .",
    "high - resolution hydrodynamic cosmological simulations from @xcite indicate that isolated , low - mass dark matter halos result in galaxies with stellar masses between @xmath77 and large @xmath78 ratios and stellar masses between @xmath79 , consistent with the range of possible values for agc  249525 .",
    "additionally , the n - body and semi - analytic models of @xcite predict that isolated ufds should exist in significant numbers in the local volume , with optical properties similar to known ufds , though most of these predicted ufds have lost their gas via stripping or stellar feedback effects .",
    "the putative optical counterpart for agc  249525 has an absolute magnitude that places it in the middle of the range of the faint dwarf galaxies in or near the local group .",
    "ufds like segue  1 ( @xmath80 ) , segue  2 ( @xmath81 ) , and willman  1 ( @xmath82 ) are at the faintest end of the range of known nearby dwarfs @xcite .",
    "@xcite recently discovered nine new ufds in the southern hemisphere with @xmath83 to @xmath196.6 .",
    "the gas - rich dwarfs leo",
    "p ( @xmath84 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and leo  t ( @xmath85 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are significantly brighter , though they are actively forming , or have recently formed , stars .",
    "the possible optical counterpart to agc  198606 , which is gas - rich but without active star formation , is closer to the ufds in its luminosity , with @xmath86 .",
    "agc  249525 , while more luminous than agc  198606 , is still substantially fainter than leo t and leo p.    previous work has concluded that some ufds could be the stellar populations left over after their progenitor dwarf galaxies were stripped of gas and stars by the milky way @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we speculated that , with the discovery of gas - rich galaxies with extremely sparse stellar populations like agc  198606 and now agc  249525 , a different formation scenario for ufds is possible . with less massive progenitors ,",
    "less stripping would be necessary to reach the low stellar masses and faint total magnitudes observed in ufds .",
    "further observations are needed to confirm the optical counterpart to agc  249525 .",
    "only the upper portion of the rgb is accessible in the current wiyn podi data , whereas a detection of hb stars would provide a more definitive distance determination .",
    "our derived distance is similar to that of leo p. @xcite used hubble space telescope ( hst ) observations to measure a distance to leo  p of @xmath24 mpc , based on a combination of trgb stars , hb stars , and rr lyrae variables . at 1.6 mpc , hb stars would have @xmath87 , so a robust detection of the hb in agc  249525 would therefore likely require very deep imaging with a large - aperture ground - based telescope or hst .",
    "spectroscopic radial velocity measurements of the putative rgb stars in this object would also help confirm the association of stars with the hi  gas , although at these magnitudes such observations would be a challenge .",
