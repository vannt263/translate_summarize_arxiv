    "bi - directional relay communications have attracted considerable interest recently , and transmission schemes in bi - directional relay networks have been analyzed and compared @xcite . in @xcite , an amplify - and - forward  ( af ) protocol based network coding scheme , was discussed .",
    "the transmission in this af bi - directional relay network takes place in two time slots .",
    "two source nodes first transmit at the same time through the aid of one or multiple relays .",
    "the relay receives a superimposed signal , and then amplifies the received signal and forwards it back to both source nodes .",
    "analog network coding has been proved particularly useful in wireless networks as the wireless channels are used as a natural implementation of network coding by summing the wireless signals over the air @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the performance of wireless relay networks can be further enhanced by properly selecting the relays for transmission @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "relay selection methods were reported for conventional one - way af schemes to achieve full spatial diversity , and hybrid one - way relay selection schemes were discussed in @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed max - min sum rate selection algorithm for af bi - directional networks based on the outage probability . in @xcite , it analyzed the diversity orders of various relay selection schemes . in @xcite",
    ", two - way relay selection was introduced for differential modulation systems to improve system performance . in @xcite",
    ", it presented a max - min snr based relay selection algorithm for two - way relay networks . in @xcite ,",
    "opportunistic relay selection was proposed , and in @xcite , it discussed the performance bound by maximizing the overall channel capacity in order to realize the best relay node selection .",
    "consequently , it is beneficial to design an effective relay selection scheme for the coherent bi - directional transmission scheme with multiple relays as well in order to achieve spatial diversity .",
    "power allocation  ( pa ) in one - way relay systems has been intensively studied so far . since two - way relay system works quite differently and is more complex than one - way relay system , the pa algorithms developed for one - way relaying",
    "can not be readily used in two - way relay systems .",
    "most work on pa for two - way relaying , e.g. @xcite , were proposed to maximize the sum rate of the user pair . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considers power allocation with wireless network coding in a multiple - relay multiple - user networks using convex optimization . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors presented power allocation strategies to maximize the sum rate and the diversity order , respectively . in @xcite ,",
    "two power allocation algorithms were proposed to maximize the upper bound of average sum rate , and to achieve the trade - off of outage probability between two terminals , respectively .",
    "it is well known that the symbol error rate  ( ser ) performance also plays an important role for many applications , but the optimal power allocation  ( opa ) optimization problem in a two - way relay system has not been investigated in order to minimize the system ser .",
    "hence , it is extremely useful to study the opa problem minimizing the ser for bi - directional relay networks .    in this paper , we propose a relay selection amplify - and - forward  ( rs - af ) protocol for bi - directional relay networks using af with two sources and @xmath0 relays . in the proposed scheme , two source nodes",
    "first transmit to all the relays at the same time .",
    "the signals received at the relay is a superposition of two transmitted symbols from both sources .",
    "then a single relay which minimizes the sum ser of two source nodes is selected out of @xmath0 relays to forward the network coded signals back to both sources .",
    "however , the performance of optimal relay selection is very difficult to analyze .    to facilitate the selection process",
    ", we introduce a sub - optimal but low - complexity min - max criterion based method , where a single relay which minimizes the maximum ser of two source nodes is selected .",
    "based on the min - max selection procedure , we present a simple asymptotic ser expression and make comparisons with the conventional all - participate amplify - and - forward  ( ap - af ) relaying scheme . to improve the system performance , opa between the sources and the relay is determined based on the asymptotic ser .",
    "the performance of the proposed rs - af scheme is verified through simulations .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  ii , we describe the system model . in section  iii",
    ", we present the proposed rs - af scheme .",
    "the performance is analyzed and compared with ap - af in section  iv . in section  v , the opa solution of rs - af is given .",
    "simulation results are provided in section  vi . in section  vii ,",
    "we draw the main conclusions .    _ * notation * _ : boldface lower - case letters denote vectors , @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 represent conjugate , transpose , and conjugate transpose , respectively .",

    "we consider a general bi - directional relay network , consisting of two source nodes , denoted by @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and @xmath0 relay nodes , denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "we assume that all nodes are equipped with single antenna . in the proposed rs - af scheme , as shown by the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : rs - af - blockdia ] , each message exchange between two source nodes takes place in two phases . in the first phase , both source nodes simultaneously send the information to all relays and the signal received at each relay",
    "is a superimposed signal . in the second phase ,",
    "an optimal single relay node is selected to forward the received signals to two source nodes and all other relay nodes keep idle . in this paper",
    ", we assume that the fading coefficients are constant over one frame , and vary independently from one frame to another .",
    "note that the proposed strategy requires calculating the instantaneous snr of both links which can be realized by training or preambles .",
    "relay selection can be then carried out , and data transmission will use the selected relay until the next channel estimation period comes . for simplicity , we assume perfect channel estimation , and the source and the relay nodes have all the links information .",
    "let @xmath10 , @xmath11 , denote the symbol to be transmitted by the source @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that @xmath10 is chosen from a constellation of unity power @xmath13 .",
    "the signal received in the @xmath14-th relay at time @xmath15 can be expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents the transmit power at @xmath7 and @xmath8 , @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) stands for the fading coefficient between @xmath12 and @xmath20 with zero mean and unit variance , and @xmath21 is a zero mean complex gaussian random variable with two sided power spectral density of @xmath22 per dimension .    upon receiving the signals",
    ", the relay @xmath20 then processes the received signal and then forwards to two source nodes .",
    "let @xmath23 be the signal generated by the relay @xmath20 and it is given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is an amplification factor , so that the signal transmitted by the relay satisfies the following power constraint @xmath26    then , the relay @xmath20 forwards @xmath27 to two source nodes .",
    "the signal received by @xmath12 where @xmath28 , denoted by @xmath29 , can be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 represents the transmit power at the relay node .    combining ( [ eq : yr ] ) , ( [ eq : xr ] ) , and ( [ eq : y11 ] ) , after subtracting its own information , the received signal at each source can be respectively written as @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .    finally , the following maximum likelihood  ( ml ) detector can be applied to recover the received signals @xmath36",
    "in the proposed rs - af scheme , only one best relay is selected out of @xmath0 relays to forward the received anc signals in the second phase transmission .",
    "we assume that at the beginning of each transmission , some pilot symbols are transmitted by two source nodes to assist in the relay selection .",
    "one source node ( either source @xmath7 or @xmath8 ) will determine the one best relay according to a certain criterion and broadcast the index of the selected relay to all relays .",
    "then , only the selected relay , known by both source nodes , is active in the second phase of transmission and the rest of relays will keep idle .",
    "we in the next present two relay selection methods .      for",
    "the optimal rs - af  ( o - rs - af ) , among all relays , the destination will select one relay , denoted by @xmath37 , which has the minimum destination ser for the user pair : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath28 , represent the ser at source nodes @xmath12 from the @xmath14-th relay given @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",

    "we propose a sub - optimal rs - af  ( s - rs - af ) scheme .",
    "it is well - known that the sum sers of two source nodes .",
    "i.e. @xmath50 , is typically dominated by the ser of the worst user . as a result , for low complexity",
    ", the relay node , which minimizes the maximum ser of two users , can be selected to achieve the near - optimal ser performance .",
    "we refer to such a selection criterion as the min - max selection criterion .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the selected relay .",
    "then the min - max selection can be formulated as follows , @xmath51 which can be further formulated by using the effective snrs @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "in this section , we derive the analytical average ser of the proposed rs - af schemes based on the min - max criterion . as mentioned before , the optimal relay selection scheme is very difficult to analyze . as it will be shown later",
    ", the min - max selection scheme proposed in subsection iii - b has almost the same performance as the optimal selection scheme . therefore , in this section",
    ", we will instead analyze the performance of the s - rs - af scheme .",
    "now let us first calculate the pdf of @xmath54 in ( [ eq : relayselcsnr ] ) .",

    "let @xmath66 and @xmath67 represent its pdf and cdf , respectively . for simplicity",
    ", assuming that @xmath55 and @xmath56 are independent , then the pdf of @xmath68 can be calculated by using order statistics as @xcite    @xmath69^{n-1 } ,   \\label{eq : fpdff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and by upper bounding ( [ eq : insnr1 ] ) with harmonic mean , @xmath57 can be obtained with the help of  @xcite @xmath72u(x ) ,   \\label{eq : pdfaafk}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath73 and @xmath74 denote the zeroth - order and first - order modified bessel functions of the second kind , respectively , and @xmath75 is the unit step function . at high snr , when @xmath76 approaches zeros , the @xmath77 function converges to @xmath78  @xcite , and the value of the @xmath73 function is comparatively small , which could be ignored for asymptotic analysis . hence , at high snr , @xmath57 in ( [ eq : pdfaafk ] ) can be reduced as @xmath79 where @xmath80 .",

    "\\label{eq : aveserre1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] recalling ( [ eq : fcdf ] ) and @xmath86 , ( [ eq : aveserre1 ] ) can be further written as @xmath88 based on the fact that @xmath89  @xcite , we can finally obtain @xmath90 where @xmath91 .",
    "it clearly indicates in ( [ eq : aveser ] ) that a diversity order of @xmath0 can be achieved for the proposed rs - af scheme in a bi - directional relay network with two sources and @xmath0 relays .",
    "note that for other types of channels , e.g. nakagami-@xmath92 , rician fading channels , we may merely use the similar approach to derive the the cdf of @xmath54 in ( [ eq : fcdf ] ) , and by ( [ eq : avesertemp ] ) , the analytical ser can be obtained .      in this section",
    "we first derive the ser of ap - af .",
    "note that the first phase of rs - af and ap - af is the same .",
    "but in the ap - af scheme , all the relay nodes are used to forward the received signals over mutually orthogonal channels , as shown by the dash lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : rs - af - blockdia ] . as a result ,",
    "the effective snr at the source node becomes @xmath93 where @xmath94 represents the effective snr at the @xmath95-th source node . for fairness , total transmit energy and equal power division among relay nodes",
    "are assumed for both systems .    by using a general result from @xcite , the ser in ( [ eq : aveser ] )",
    "can be approximated in the high snr regime by considering a first order expansion of the cdf of @xmath94 .",
    "specifically , if the first order expansion of the cdf of @xmath94 , can be written in the form @xmath96 where @xmath97 represents a constant value , at high snr , the asymptotic average ser of ap - af can be written as @xcite @xmath98 given by @xcite , we can get @xmath99 where @xmath100 .    substituting ( [ eq : partialnf ] ) into ( [ eq : aveserap1 ] ) , it yields @xmath101 comparing ( [ eq : aveser ] ) with ( [ eq : aveserap ] ) , we can finally obtain @xmath102 we can easily prove that the ratio in ( [ eq : avesercom ] ) is always smaller than @xmath103 for all @xmath104 .",
    "it clearly indicates that rs - af obtains better ser than ap - af , and this gain gets larger when the number of relay nodes increases .",
    "note that the major difference between rs - af and ap - af is that the rs - af utilizes all the transmit power in the best relay , while ap - af equally splits the transmit power into every relay node . in the rs - af",
    ", there exits a relay node determination process , but ap - af does not .",
    "in this section , we present how to allocate power to both sources and the relay subject to the total transmission power constraint",
    ". it can be seen from ( [ eq : aveser ] ) that the asymptotic ser of the proposed rs - af scheme depends non - linearly upon @xmath17 and @xmath31 .",
    "hence , when the total transmit power is fixed , @xmath105 , the power allocation problem over rayleigh channels can be formulated to minimize the asymptotic ser in  ( [ eq : aveser ] ) @xmath106 the power allocation problem is to find @xmath107 such that the ser in ( [ eq : aveser ] ) is minimized subject to the power constraint by solving the following optimization problem @xmath108 where @xmath109 is a positive lagrange multiplier .",
    "the necessary condition for the optimality is found by setting the derivatives of the lagrangian in ( [ eq : flag ] ) with respect to @xmath17 and @xmath31 equal to zero , respectively .",
    "and we can get @xmath110 integrating the power constraint @xmath105 and @xmath111 given in ( [ eq : aveser ] ) into ( [ eq : eq1 ] ) , we can obtain that @xmath112 which indicates the power allocated in the relay should be equal to the total transmit power at both sources in order to compensate the energy used to broadcast combined information in one time slot regardless of the number of relays .",
    "the ser improvement using optimum power allocation in comparison of the equal power allocation can be calculated as @xmath113 which shows that the improvement exponentially gets increased with the number of relay nodes .",
    "in this section , we provide simulation results for the proposed rs - af scheme . for symmetrical reasons , both source nodes should have the same ser , and thus , it would be sufficient to examine only one source node .",
    "we include the ap - af scheme for comparison .",
    "all simulations are performed for a bpsk modulation over the rayleigh fading channels . for simplicity , we assume that the total energy @xmath114 , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath20 ( @xmath115 ) have the same noise variance @xmath116 . the snr @xmath117 can be then calculated as @xmath118 .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : os_rs_af ] , we compare the optimal relay selection method and the sub - optimal min - max relay selection method , where @xmath119 .",
    "it can be observed from the figure that the proposed s - rs - af approach has almost the same ser as the o - rs - af scheme . in particular ,",
    "when the number of relay nodes increases , we almost can not observe any difference between these two methods , which indicates that the min - max relay selection achieves near optimal single relay selection performance .",
    "we can also see from fig .",
    "[ fig : os_rs_af ] performance gets improved when the number of relay increases .",
    "note that , for convenience , we in the rest of the paper use rs - af to replace s - rs - af .",
    "[ fig : ap_rs_af ] compares the simulated ser performance of our proposed rs - af scheme and the ap - af schemes for @xmath120 relay nodes . for rs - af , @xmath119 , while for ap - af , @xmath121 and @xmath122 .",
    "it can be observed that the proposed scheme has much better performance than the ap - af scheme .",
    "this can be verified by the theoretical analysis given in ( [ eq : avesercom ] ) .",
    "particularly , as @xmath123 , ( [ eq : avesercom ] ) can be reduced to @xmath124 .",
    "correspondingly , it shows at high snr , e.g. @xmath125 db , in fig .",
    "[ fig : ap_rs_af ] that the rs - af scheme has a better ser of a factor about @xmath126 , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 over ap - af with @xmath120 respectively , which also indicates the ser gain increases with the number of relay nodes .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : analytical_rs_af ] , we compare the analytical and simulated ser performance of the proposed rs - af scheme . from the figure",
    ", it shows that at high snr , the asymptotic analytical ser given by ( [ eq : aveser ] ) is converged to the simulated result using optimal relay selection .",
    "this verifies the derived analytical expressions .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : rs_af_pa ] , we examine the ser performance of the rs - af scheme using opa with @xmath129 and @xmath130 subject to the total power constraint for @xmath131 .",
    "the epa results are provided for comparison with @xmath132 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : rs_af_pa ] , it can be observed that with opa , the proposed scheme obtains better performance gain in comparison with the equal power allocation scheme at high snr , and this improvement gets increased exponentially with the number of relay nodes , satisfying ( [ eq : sercomp ] ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rs_af_pa_lambda ] , we plot the ser curves in terms of @xmath133 defined in ( [ eq : insnr1 ] ) using different noise variance , and the number of relays is set as two .",
