    "[ fig : four]a",
    ". the two attractors are identical and overlap at @xmath55 .",

    "let us now come back to the result of fig .",
    "[ fig : one ] , that for @xmath64 one of the stle is positive and the other is negative .",
    "these stles tell us about the behavior of the distance between the attractors as viewed from each of them in the linear approximation .",
    "thus , we can say that in the linear approximation one of the attractors is trying to fly away while the other one is trying to hold them together .",
    "the stability of the coupled system implies that the negative stle wins the battle .",
    "it appears that as @xmath1 increases , the hold of the negative stle decreases and hence the two attractors start drifting away from each other and for large values of @xmath1 the system becomes unstable .",
    "since rssler oscillators are chaotic it is not easy to decipher the behavior of the desynchronization bifurcation .",
    "hence , we now propose a simple model of coupled integrable systems showing a similar desynchronization bifurcation .",
    "it is easy to see that with one dimensional systems we do not get the desynchronization bifurcation . hence the minimum dimension is two .",

    "the model system is chosen so that the synchronizd state corresponds to the fixed point @xmath72 for small values of @xmath1 and we observe a desynchronization transition as @xmath1 increases @xcite .",
    "for this to happen the parameters of the system must obey the conditions ; @xmath73 . under these conditions ,",
    "the fixed point @xmath74 becomes unstable at the critical coupling constant @xmath75 .",
    "we first consider quadratic nonlinearity @xcite , @xmath76 with quadratic nonlinearity , the model system has three fixed points .",
