    "deployment of semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) in the active region of optical devices offers unique electronic and optical properties which can be exploited to design several optoelectronic technologies ranging from lasers@xcite to semiconductor optical amplifiers ( soas)@xcite or single photon sources@xcite , where they have successfully overcome critical challenges such as extremely low threshold , high speed response , or entangled photon emission , respectively .",
    "however , in these applications , a critical design parameter is the polarization response of qds , typically characterized in terms of either degree of polarization [ dop = ( te - tm)/(te+tm)]@xcite or tm / te ratio@xcite , where te - mode is measured along a direction in the plane of the qd , and tm - mode is measured along the growth [ 001 ] direction for the gaas(001 ) qds .",
    "engineering of qd nanostrcutures to achieve isotropic polarization ( dop @xmath4 0 ) is critical for the implementation of several optoelectronic devices , for example semiconductor optical amplifiers ( soa s ) .",
    "inas qds grown by the stranski - krastonov ( sk ) self - assembly growth process typically exhibit very poor polarization response ( dop close to 1.0 ) due to the large compressive biaxial strain surrounding the flat shapes of the qds .",
    "the strain induced splitting between the heavy hole ( hh ) and the light hole ( lh ) valence bands leads to a dominant hh character in the few top most valence band states , thus significantly suppressing the tm - mode .",
    "therefore , previous studies of the single inas qds have reported very high values of the dop , typically larger than 0.8.@xcite    the polarization response of inas qds is influenced by several parameters such as crystal / atomic symmetry , qd shape , composition profile etc .",
    "the atomistic asymmetry of the underlying zincblende crystals implies that the [ 110 ] and [ @xmath310 ] directions are inequivalent .",
    "this lowers the overall symmetry of a perfectly circular dome - shaped qd from c@xmath5 to c@xmath6 . as a result , te - mode in the plane of the qd does not remain symmetric and significant in - plane anisotropy may be observed even for an ideal circular - base inas qd.@xcite therefore , a single value of the dop is not sufficient to characterize the polarization response of the qd systems .",
    "this , in the past studies@xcite , has lead us to define a direction - dependent value of the dop ,    @xmath7 } = \\frac{(te_{[\\overrightarrow{n}]}-tm_{[001]})}{(te_{[\\overrightarrow{n}]}+tm_{[001 ] } ) }     \\end{array}\\ ] ]     + where the direction , [ @xmath8 = [ 110 ] or [ @xmath310 ] , associated with the dop@xmath0}$ ] is same as the direction of the te@xmath0}$]-mode in the plane of the qd .",
    "the value of the dop@xmath0}$ ] also strongly depends on the shape of the qds , which is significantly affected by the growth dynamics of the self - assembly process during the growth of the capping layers and the post - growth annealing processes@xcite . as a result",
    ", the shape of a sk self - assembled qd is far from being perfectly circular or square , as typically assumed in the past theoretical studies of the polarization properties .",
    "several experimental investigations have suggested that the actual shape of the qds significantly deviates from the ideal circular - base ( for dome or lens ) or square - base ( for pyramid ) , and usually tends to elongate along the [ 110]@xcite or along the [ @xmath310]@xcite directions .",
    "furthermore , recent advancements in the growth techniques have allowed to control the shape of qds , leading to the fabrication of strongly elongated qd like nano - structures.@xcite these offer an enhanced exciton oscillator strength and allow the realization of single exciton - single photon coupling to build the fundamental blocks for the solid state quantum information.@xcite such elongations of the qds along the [ @xmath8 = [ 110 ] or [ @xmath310 ] direction can significantly alter the value of the dop@xmath0}$ ] and may be exploited to achieve tailored polarization response for a desired operation .    * _ brief overview of the past theoretical studies : _ * despite significant experimental evidence for the elongation of the qd shapes and its prospective potential to tune the polarization properties , the impact of the base elongations on the value of the dop@xmath0}$ ] is only barely known .",
    "the previous theoretical investigations of the qd elongations are focused on the study and design of the fine structure splitting ( fss = energetic difference between the two bright excitons , e@xmath2}$ ] - e@xmath1}$ ] )  @xcite or the spin polarization  @xcite , with very little emphasis given to the study of the polarization properties ( comparison of the magnitudes of the te and tm modes).@xcite    sheng _ _ et al.__@xcite applied an effective bond - orbital model and discussed the impact of the base elongations on the in - plane polarization anisotropy of the ingaas qds defined as :    @xmath9}-te_{[110]})}{(te_{[\\overline{1}10]}+te_{[110 ] } ) }     \\end{array}\\ ] ]     + and they concluded that the electron - electron interactions and the alloy intermixing have very little contributions in determining the polarization properties of the qds .",
    "mlinar _ _ et al.__@xcite , using an atomistic pseudo - potential model , focused on the ingaas qds and studied the impact of the ( in , ga)as alloy randomness on the polarization properties .",
    "they concluded that the alloy composition fluctuations can significantly change the in - plane polarization anisotropy and therefore the experimentally measured polarization anisotropy may not be considered as a reliable measure of the qd shape asymmetry .",
    "schliwa _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , based on their * * k**@xmath10*p * calculations , studied the impact of piezoelectricity on the qd optical properties .",
    "although they provided a detailed investigation of the electronic and optical properties of the dome and pyramidal shaped qds as a function of their vertical aspect ratio ( height / base ) , only one case of the pyramidal shaped qds ( series d in their paper ) was investigated for the study of the base elongations ( lateral aspect ratio ) .",
    "furthermore , in their study of the lateral aspect ratios of the pyramidal qds , they kept the overall volume of the qds unchanged by altering both the heights and the base diameters of the qds .",
    "since the qd energies are strongly influenced by a change in their height parameter@xcite , so the reported results did not isolate the impact of the qd base elongations .",
    "nevertheless , a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the impact of the qd base elongations on the polarization dependent room temperature ground state optical emissions still remain unavailable .",
    "this paper , therefore , aims to bridge this gap by providing a detailed study of the dop@xmath0}$ ] and pol@xmath11 for the [ 110]- and [ @xmath310]-elongated qds . for the calculation of the polarization dependent optical modes ( te and tm ) , we take into account the highest five valence band states , instead of just a single top most valence band state , in accordance with the recent studies  @xcite where it has been shown that the calculation of the room temperature ground state optical spectra must involve multiple closely spaced valence band states to accurately model the in - plane polarizability and to avoid discrepancy between the theory and experiments .",
    "our calculations show that despite tuning of the dop@xmath0}$ ] over a wide range , the elliptical shapes of the single qds do not lead to an isotropic polarization .",
    "therefore , we extend our study to multi - layer qd stacks .    * _ isotropic polarization from multi - layer stacks : _ * past theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite studies have shown that the polarization response of the qds can be drastically improved by growing large vertical stacks of qds ( vsqds ) , consisting of many closely spaced qd layers to exploit inter - dot strain and electronic couplings .",
    "a recent experimental study  @xcite has shown that a vertical stack of nine qds ( 9-vsqds ) exhibits dop@xmath1}$ ] = -0.6 ; however the measured pl spectra showed a large anisotropy in the in - plane polarization modes : te@xmath2 } \\gg$ ] te@xmath1}$ ] .",
    "our atomistic calculations  @xcite , based on an assumption of ideal circular - base dome - shape for the qd layers , reported te@xmath2 } \\gg$ ] te@xmath1}$ ] in agreement with experimental pl spectra .",
    "we attributed this large in - plane polarization anisotropy to a small increase in the tm@xmath12}$]-mode ( coming from an enhanced hh / lh intermixing ) and a large decrease in the te@xmath1}$]-mode due to the [ @xmath310]-oriented hole wave function confinements .    a good qualitative agreement of our calculations with the experimental results assuming ideal circular - base for the qds leads to a fundamental question that how much is the contribution from the qd shape asymmetry in the polarization anisotropy for the 9-vsqds ?",
    "this work , based on multi - million - atom calculations , provides the answer that the interfacial hole wave function confinements have major contribution in the experimentally measured in - plane polarization anisotropy , which is counter - intuitive to the common notion where the shape asymmetry is considered mainly response for such anisotropies.@xcite    furthermore , as an [ 110]-elongation increases dop@xmath1}$ ] and reduces dop@xmath2}$ ] , so we investigate the possibility to exploit it to balance the built - in in - plane anisotropy such that to achieve dop@xmath1 } \\sim$ ] 0 and dop@xmath2 } \\sim$ ] 0 ?",
    "this would lead to the design of the qd based soas independent of the in - plane direction .",
    "our study reveals an interesting property of the 9-vsqds that its polarization response is very sensitive to the orientation of its elongation and both te - modes can not be reduced below tm - mode .",
    "therefore , either dop@xmath2}$ ] or dop@xmath1}$ ] can be tuned for an isotropic polarization , and not both of them simultaneously .",
    "finally , the quantitative study of the elongation dependent dop@xmath0}$ ] also helps us to determine the geometry of the 9-vsqds .",
    "our theoretical calculations accurately predict [ @xmath310 ] elongation of the 9-vsqds in the experiment , which is also consistent with the tem images@xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized in the following sections : section ii defines qd geometry parameters and describes the three types of elliptical shapes that we study in this paper .",
    "section iii documents our methodologies .",
    "our results for two different ar single qds are presented in sections iv - a and iv - b .",

    "the sections iv - a , iv - b , and iv - c are written as self - contained sections so that a reader interested in only one type of qds may only require to read the corresponding section .",

    "the quantum dots are placed on top of 0.5 nm thick inas wetting layers .",
    "we study three dome - shaped quantum dot systems : ( i ) a low aspect ratio ( ar ) inas qd with 20 nm diameter ( d ) and 4.5 nm height ( h ) , ( ar = h / d = 0.225 ) ; ( ii ) a high ar inas qd with d = 20 nm and h = 8.0 nm ( ar = h / d = 0.40 ) ; ( iii ) a vertical stack comprised of nine qd layers ( 9-vsqds ) separated by 5 nm thick gaas spacer layers , where each layer consists of an inas qd with d = 20 nm and h = 4 nm . the geometrical parameters of this 9-vsqds are taken from the recent experimental@xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies where it has shown great technological relevance for achieving isotropic polarization response .    in remainder of this paper , we label the single qd with ar = 0.225 as a `` flat '' qd and the single qd with ar = 0.40 as a `` tall '' qd . in a previous study  @xcite , it has been shown that the flat and tall qds with an ideal circular - base exhibit drastically different electronic and polarization properties .",
    "the hole wave functions tend to reside in the hh pockets for the tall qds , when the ar @xmath16 0.25 .",
    "this introduces a large anisotropy in the in - plane polarization ( pol@xmath11 ) .",
    "therefore , this paper analyses the impact of the base elongations for both types of the qds .",
    "furthermore , as the 9-vsqds consists of strongly coupled qds so it can essentially be considered as an extension of the single tall qd with a very large ar @xmath17 45/20 = 2.25 .",
    "our calculations presented in the section ( iv ) confirm that the two single qds ( flat and tall ) exhibit drastically different polarization properties as a function of their base elongations , and the 9-vsqds overall exhibiting many similar characteristics as that of the tall qd .    note that a typical sk growth of a large vertical qd stack generally results in an increase in the size of the upper layer qds@xcite , however , no such increase in the qd dimensions is reported in the experimental study@xcite .",

    "+ ( ii ) change in qd diameter ( @xmath19d ) : the qd base elongations are based on the increase / decrease of the qd diameters along the [ 110 ] and [ @xmath310 ] directions . while this decrease / increase in the diameters will have very little impact on the ground state electron energy e1 ( due to its s - type symmetrical wave function ) , it will affect the electron and hole p - states energies due to their orientation along these directions .",
    "the increase ( decrease ) in the diameters will produce corresponding increase ( decrease ) in the electron energies and decrease ( increase ) in the hole energies , oriented along their directions .",
    "+ ( iii ) strain : the strain directly modifies the band edges and thus impacts the electron and hole confinement energies .",
    "the electron energies are shifted by changes in the hydrostatic strain ( @xmath28 ) only , whereas the hole energies are affected by changes in both the hydrostatic and the biaxial strain ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "simple analytical relations based on the deformation potential theory can be applied to estimate these changes@xcite .",
    "+ ( iv ) piezoelectric potential : inas / gaas systems are strongly piezoelectric : the orientation and the magnitude of the piezoelectric potentials significantly impacts the orientation and the splitting of the electron and hole excited states .",
    "it should be noted that although the piezoelectric potentials do not directly shift the electron and hole p - state energies , but they determine the @xmath19d induced changes by controlling the orientation of the p - states .",
    "overall for the type - i elongation , @xmath19v is large whereas @xmath19d is small since we keep one diameter unchanged and only reduce the other diameter by @xmath19d , so the impact of @xmath19v dominates . for the type - ii elongation ,",
    "the qd volume only slightly decreases , so the impact of @xmath19v is small .",
    "however , we increase one diameter by @xmath19d and decrease the other diameter by @xmath19d , so the overall impact of @xmath19d is much stronger .",
    "finally , for the type - iiv elongation , @xmath19v=0 , and @xmath19d is roughly same as for the type - ii elongation .      in this subsection",
    ", we study the impact of the elongations on the electronic and polarization properties of a flat qd as shown by the schematic in fig .",

    "the quadruple nature of the potentials is clearly evident which has been well established in the literature@xcite and is shown to strongly influence the orientation of the electron and hole p - states . in this case of the flat qd with ar=0.225 , we find that the quadratic component of the piezoelectric potential does not fully cancel the linear component inside the qd region in contrast to the previous * * k**@xmath10*p * study  @xcite , where the quadratic and the linear components were found to fully cancel each other for the ar @xmath24 0.5 . since the piezoelectric potentials are a strong function of the qd shape and composition , so we find that their results can not be generalized to all types of qds .",
    "theoretical studies by usman _ et al_.@xcite and islam _ et al_.@xcite have also shown non - zero values of the net piezoelectric potentials for the similar qds .",
    "our calculations show that the piezoelectric potential plots have two peaks at the qd interfaces , one just outside the qd region and one just inside the qd region .",
    "the electron and hole wave functions are found to be more influenced by the piezoelectric potential peaks inside the qd , which causes the lower electron p - state ( e2 ) to align along the [ @xmath310 ] direction and the ground hole state ( h1 ) to slightly elongate along the [ 110 ] direction for the circular - base qd ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fig3 ] for @xmath18 = 1.0 ) .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] that the piezoelectric potentials do not exhibit any significant change for the elongated qds .",

    "these relatively small changes in the potentials will not result in any noticeable effects on the e2 and e3 energies .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the electron energies are mainly affected by the changes in the diameters ( @xmath19d ) and the volume ( @xmath19v ) of the flat qd , while the strain and the piezoelectric fields have only minor contributions as a function of @xmath18 .    the lowest electron energy level ( e1 ) has s - type symmetrical wave function and is mainly affected by the decrease in the qd volume ( @xmath19v ) . the qd diameter change ( @xmath19d )",
    "does not have any noticeable impact on its energy . in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig2](b ) , e1 energy is almost unchanged confirming that @xmath19d has only minor impact on e1 . finally , for the type - ii elongation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](c ) ) , @xmath19v is very small and a corresponding small increase in the e1 energy is observed .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows that the wave function for the e1 state also retains its s - type symmetry , with only slight elongation along the direction in which the qd is being elongated .",
    "the excited conduction band states ( e2 and e3 ) have p - type symmetry and thus gets strongly affected by all of the three types of elongations .",
    "the @xmath19v is once again a dominant factor , which pushes these energy levels towards higher values .",
    "this is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](a ) where both e2 and e3 increase in energy irrespective of the elongation direction . however , if @xmath19v=0 as in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2](b ) , the increase in the qd diameter reduces the energy of the state aligned along its direction and vice versa .",
    "the type - ii elongation is an interesting case where the two factors , @xmath19v and @xmath19d , compete as the qd diameters along the [ 110 ] and [ @xmath310 ] directions are changed by equal values . since the lower p - state ( e2 )",
    "is always oriented along the major - axis of the elliptical shape , so any increase in the corresponding diameter tends to reduce its energy while the decrease in the qd volume pushes it towards the higher energies .",
    "for the small values of the elongation factor ( @xmath18 = 0.67 , 0.82 , 1.22 , and 1.5 ) , e2 decreases due to dominance of @xmath19d induced shift . however , for the larger values of the elongation factor ( @xmath18 = 0.54 and 1.86 ) , the @xmath19v induced upward shift overcomes the @xmath19d induced downward shift and hence the energy of e2 increases .",
    "the energy of the higher p - state , e3 , always increases as a function of @xmath18 because it is oriented along the shorter diameter direction and hence an increase in its energy is supported by both , @xmath19v and @xmath19d .",
    "* _ electron p - state splitting : _ * the energy difference between the p - states ( @xmath19e@xmath30 = e3-e2 ) is an important parameter of interest as it provides a measure of the confinement anisotropy between the [ 110 ] and [ @xmath310 ] directions@xcite and is sometimes used to characterize the fine structure splitting ( fss)@xcite . we find that @xmath19e@xmath30 is always larger for the [ @xmath310]-elongations as compared to the [ 110]-elongations for the same of @xmath18 .",

    "<S> the demonstration of isotropic polarization response from semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) is a crucial step towards the design of several optoelectronic technologies . among many parameters that impact the degree of polarization ( dop@xmath0}$ ] ) of a qd system , the shape asymmetry is a critical factor . </S>",

    "<S> the comparison between a low aspect ratio ( ar ) and a high ar qd reveals that the electronic and the polarization properties strongly depend on the ar of the qd ; the elongation of a tall qd allows tuning of the dop@xmath0}$ ] over a much wider range . </S>",
    "<S> we then extend our analysis to an experimentally reported vertical stack of nine qds ( 9-vsqds ) that has shown significant potential to achieve isotropic polarization properties . </S>",

    "<S> our analysis shows that the orientation of the base elongation controls the sign of the dop@xmath0}$ ] ; however the magnitude of the base elongation has only a very little impact on the magnitude of the dop@xmath0}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we further predict that the elliptical shape of the 9-vsqds can only tune either dop@xmath1}$ ] or dop@xmath2}$ ] for the isotropic response . </S>",
    "<S> our model results , in agreement with the tem findings , suggest that the experimentally grown 9-vsqds has either a circular - base or a slightly [ @xmath310 ] elongated base . </S>",
