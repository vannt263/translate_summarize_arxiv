    "for simplicity , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are supposed to have the same energy than the on - site energy of an electron propagating site by site along the @xmath11 and @xmath12 chains . @xmath132 and",

    "in particular when there are no quantum states in the junction , a small @xmath141 through space electronic coupling can remain between @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "this is exactly the conditions used by j. bardeen @xcite to get the low bias voltage v tunneling current intensity @xmath142 through a simple @xmath143 tunneling junction where @xmath144 and @xmath145 are the @xmath146 and @xmath147 electronic density of states . for the simple fig",

    "as described in section 2 , preparing this simple system in the non - stationary state @xmath8 , the time variations of the @xmath9 population amplitude during the heisenberg - rabi oscillation process is simply given by @xmath154 .",
    "then using ( 20 ) and inserting this @xmath132 in ( 17 ) leads to :    @xmath155    which is the exact @xmath156 one can calculate analytically applying a simple scattering approach on a valence bond like canonical mono - electronic basis set @xcite .",
    "interestingly , ( 22 ) reduces to ( [ eq : t1_bardeen ] ) for @xmath157 confirming that at low coupling and for this very simple @xmath143 quantum system @xmath156 is proportional to the square of the @xmath158 oscillation frequency @xcite indicating that @xmath134 is rather universal .",

    "also for the simple @xmath143 bardeen tunnel junction , ( 17 ) with ( 19 ) is able to pick up at low coupling the secular oscillation frequency of @xmath132 leading to @xmath159 .",
    "there is a limit of the functioning of this transduction because @xmath133 is bond from above to unity and as demonstrated in section 2 , @xmath0 and then @xmath2 are monotonically increasing with @xmath1 .",
    "this limit manifests itself by the peculiar variation of @xmath133 as a function of @xmath2 when @xmath2 is increasing so much that @xmath133 is saturating to unity .    according to ( 4 ) and",
    "( 14 ) , @xmath132 is a linear superposition of sinusoidal terms with different oscillation frequencies . since under the modulus , ( 17 ) is a linear transformation and to understand the functioning of ( 17 )",
    ", one can consider for @xmath132 simply a @xmath160 or a @xmath161 depending respectively of the odd or even number of state in the bus lines .",
    "the unique property of ( 17 ) is that for @xmath132 = @xmath162 , @xmath156 will decrease for large @xmath141 after reaching @xmath156 = 1 while for @xmath163 , @xmath156 will saturate to unity for large @xmath141 ( figure 4 ) .",
    "this is at the origin of the debate in the literature about the validity of the @xmath164 superposition law @xcite and @xcite since depending on the odd or even number of states per line in the quantum bus , @xmath132 can be either a @xmath160 or a @xmath165 .",
    "this will be discussed in more details in the next section .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     @xmath166    in figure ( [ fig : variation2 ] ) , the range of the @xmath4 law validity is presented by plotting the @xmath167 ratio for a 2-states perline bus . for small @xmath23 ( figure [ fig : variation2 ] right panel ) , the @xmath4 law is valid at least for @xmath1 going from 1 to 5 .",
    "but for large @xmath23 , this is no more the case . as discussed in section 3 and illustrated in fig .",
    "4 , this is caused by the property of the transformation ( 17 ) . notice that this @xmath4 law is valid for any odd and even number of states per line in the bus as soon as the increase in @xmath1 is not compensating the @xmath33 tunneling condition .",
    "interestingly and also for @xmath33 , the @xmath4 superposition law is a generalisation to n quantum conductance mounted in parallel of the @xmath168 superposition law known in a tunnel regime for 2 quantum conductances @xmath169 and @xmath170 mounted in parallel via a quantum node @xcite since for this peculiar @xmath171 case , it comes @xmath172 for @xmath173 .",
    "more interesting are now the cases where @xmath23 is closed or larger than @xmath24 or when @xmath37 . here",
    ", the value of h relative to @xmath24 must also be considered because h is determining the range in energy of the ( 17 ) transduction function .",
    "furthermore and according to ( 23 ) and ( 24 ) , h is playing the same role as @xmath74 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 in controlling this transduction outcome . in this case and as discussed in section 2 , there are many quantum control parameters values where @xmath2 is only proportional to @xmath3 and not to @xmath1 .",
    "the case raised up by c. lambert and co - workers and underlined in the introduction is corresponding exactly to @xmath174 for a 2-states per line bus with @xmath175 and @xmath176 @xcite . in that case ,",
    "section 2.2 is giving @xmath177 which is following a @xmath3 increase with @xmath1 .",
    "but using now ( [ eq : t_f_2 ] ) for this c. lambert case , @xmath178 leading for @xmath171 to @xmath179 .",
    "this is a notable decrease passing from @xmath180 to @xmath171 since for @xmath180 , @xmath181 in this case .",
    "this clarifies the literature debate concerning the @xmath4 power law .",
    "it turns out that the case raised up in @xcite is not a tunneling case .",
    "already for @xmath171 and since @xmath175 and @xmath176 , @xmath166 is already in its decaying regime for an @xmath1 increase due to the properties of the transduction function ( 17 ) .    to push further the discussion using ( 23 ) and",
    "( 24 ) , it is important to notice that for 1-state per line buses , an @xmath4 term is appearing both at the numerator and denominator of ( 23 ) . after the @xmath182 saturation for large @xmath1 , this renders difficult to follow the richness of the quantum behaviour observed in section 2 using the transduction ( 17 ) for this case , for example the @xmath3 variations of @xmath2 for large @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath0 variations with @xmath1 can not be obtained from @xmath182 in this case . for 2-states per line buses and aside from the c. lambert case @xmath175 , there are many other interesting heisenberg - rabi time - dependent quantum behavior which can be capture by ( 24 ) since there is an @xmath183 term at the @xmath166 denominator and only @xmath4 at its numerator .",
    "in(24 ) , the ( @xmath184 ) term is also playing a great role .",
    "for example and for the specific case @xmath185 where @xmath126 according to section 2.2 , the decreasing behaviours of @xmath2 with @xmath1 is captured by ( 17 ) leading to @xmath186 .",
    "this indicates how important is the tuning of h to follow the @xmath2 variations with @xmath1 i.e. to optimize the transduction process at work in a tunnel junction .",
    "we have started by analysing the quantum spectral properties of 1-state per line and 2-states per line buses with the objective to determine how the @xmath0 effective electronic coupling through such buses between an emitter and a receiver states varied as a function of the number @xmath1 of lines mounted in parallel to form this bus . for cases where it was spectrally difficult to determine @xmath0 ,",
    "we have re - enforced this analysis by triggering an heisenberg - rabi time dependent through bus quantum exchange process with an effective secular oscillation frequency @xmath2 . for this purpose , we have prepared a specific initial non - stationary pointer state and used its symmetric target pointer state to capture @xmath2 .",
    "this leads to two different @xmath2 ( and therefore @xmath0 ) regimes of variations as a function of @xmath1 : a linear one following an intuitive superposition of electronic couplings and a @xmath3 moderate increase as a function of @xmath1 . in a way to substitute the initial pointer state preparation by electronically coupling the quantum bus with semi - infinite electrodes ,",
    "we have discussed how the quantum transduction measurement process at work in such a tunneling junction can or not faithfully follow the variation with @xmath1 of the through bus @xmath0 effective electronic coupling . due to the normalisation to unity of the electronic transparency of any quantum bus and to the low pass filter like character of the transduction process at work in a tunnel junction , large @xmath0 increase due to an @xmath1 increase can not be detected by a tunneling junction .",
    "the @xmath4 superposition law is preserved for @xmath2 ( and therefore @xmath0 ) for low coupling as soon as @xmath1 is small enough not to compensate this small through bus coupling per line .",
    "the limitations of the quantum transduction at work in a tunneling junction is also pointing out how the broadly used concept of electrical contact between a metallic nanopad and a molecular wire may be better described in term of a quantum transduction process .",
    "this is opening the way for a better optimisation of this transduction at work in a tunneling junction playing for example with the detail band structure of the metallic nanopads in charge of this transduction to optimize the so - called contact conductance .",
