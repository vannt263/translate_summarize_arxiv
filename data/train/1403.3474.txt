    "[ ] , @xcite identified a redshifted jet ( hh 386 ) extending over a few arcseconds along a position angle ( pa ) of @xmath2  220@xmath3 .",
    "they also reported that a blueshifted jet was evident in 1992 december .",
    "the driving source of the jets was not clear in their data , however ; uy aur a , b , or both sources . in their wide - field survey @xcite",
    "have since failed to detect the optical jets beyond what was discovered by hirth et al .",
    "molecular hydrogen emission has also been detected from uy aur , though only from the secondary source , the infrared companion uy aur b. this emission was interpreted as arising from accretion shocks associated with the circumstellar disk @xcite .",
    "the circumbinary disk around uy aur is the second such disk that has been resolved and imaged after the gg tau a system .",
    "it was resolved for the first time in a millimeter interferometer survey @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the @xmath9co gas in the circumbinary disk is in keplerian rotation and estimated the total mass of the binary as @xmath2  1.2 m@xmath10 . using orbital parameters derived from observations",
    "obtained as far back as 1944 , @xcite estimated the total mass of the binary to be 1.61@xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "the pa of the semi - major axis of the circumbinary disk is 135@xmath3 ; the inclination angle of the disk is @xmath2  42@xmath13  3@xmath3 with respect to the line of sight .",
    "high spatial resolution near infrared imaging with adaptive optics ( ao ) has also revealed inner cavity betwen the circumstellar and circumbinary disks as well as clumpy structure in the circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "the inner cavity or gap ( i.e. the region with relatively low density ) is produced by a continuous transfer of angular momentum from the binary to the outer circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite and @xcite showed that material in the outer disk can penetrate the inner gap and episodically accrete onto the lower mass secondary star , provided the material has sufficiently high viscosity and temperature .",
    "simulations of the uy aur system by @xcite suggest that the mass accretion rate from the outer circumbinary disk onto the secondary star might be five times higher and more phase dependent than that to the primary star .",
    "however , @xcite conversely showed that usually the mass accretion rate of the primary is higher than that of the secondary , and in late times the two accretion rates become similar .",
    "many simulations produce a gas stream bridge between the circumstellar disks , as well as an accretion flow toward the individual circumstellar disks from the outer circumbinary disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite showed that the bridge contains a strong shock front caused by the collision of opposing flows .",
    "such a bridge structure has been detected in high - resolution coronagraphic h - band imaging of sr24 @xcite .",

    "recent studies suggest that binarity is common in embedded protostars @xcite .",
    "jets or outflows have been observed from a few tens of multiple low - mass young stars @xcite .",
    "for single stars , the most plausible launching mechanism is based on magnetocentrifugal acceleration in a star - disk system : scenarios include the disk wind @xcite , x - wind @xcite , and stellar wind @xcite models .",
    "jets from a binary system can be explained if the jets emanate from each single star - disk system ( e.g. l1551 irs5 : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although it has been suggested that one of the binary jets could be destroyed or engulfed by interaction between or merging of the two jets @xcite . a single outflow or jet from a binary system could also be produced by a single circumbinary disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite has also postulated that the dynamical decay of multiple systems induces outflow activity based on the fact that the binary frequency ( 79%-86% ) in 14 giant herbig - haro objects is twice higher than the higher multiple frequency .    at near - infrared ( nir )",

    "they assumed that the other four objects also had spatially extended br@xmath19 emission that was obscured by the bright continuum emission close to the central stars .",
    "the extended emission could not have been detected if the physical conditions of the jet gas were not adequate : i.e. , if the temperature were too low or the density were too high . in the case of spatially extended dust scattering , the spatial distribution of the line emission should follow that of the continuum emission .",
    "the velocity structure between uy aur a and b is complicated because of the overlap of blueshifted and redshifted emission features . a narrow structure connecting the primary and secondary disks similar to the ` bridge ' observed in the present studies",
    "is predicted by accretion flow simulations of circumbinary disks @xcite .",
    "the bridge might then be related to the boundary region between two colliding accretion flows . if the circumbinary disk planes are not perpendicular to the line of sight , both blueshifted and redshifted accretion flows would exist around the ` bridge ' structure .",
    "however , it is difficult to produce the high velocity features seen in our data as a result of colliding flows between the two circumstellar disks because the accretion gas flows should basically have keplerian velocities , of the order of a few km  s@xmath5  at the edge of circumstellar disks .",
    "thus , the high velocity emission features are probably associated with outflows launched from the vicinity of the central stars .    the [ ]",

    "@xmath28201 km  s@xmath5   ( after correcting for the 42@xmath3 inclination angle of the circumbinary disk ) . because the terminal velocity of an outflow is comparable to the keplerian rotation velocity of a disk at the launching region @xcite ,",
    "the fast flow velocities indicate that the launching region is located in a deep potential well , close to the star in the accreting star - disk system .",
    "if we use the stellar masses of the primary and secondary as 0.6@xmath12 and 0.34@xmath12 , respectively , estimated by @xcite using the pre - main - sequence tracks of @xcite , and assume three - times larger lever arm radii than the foot point radii for magnetocentrifugal acceleration @xcite , then the foot points for outflow acceleration correspond to @xmath2  0.22 0.6au and @xmath2  0.120.34au for uy aur a and b , respectively . the other estimates of stellar masses are more or less consistent with that of @xcite . based on the keplerian rotation measured by the @xmath9co gas in the circumbinary disk , @xcite estimated the total mass of the uy aur binary as @xmath2  1.2 @xmath12 .",
    "@xcite estimated the total mass of the binary as 1.61@xmath11 @xmath12 using orbital parameters derived from observations obtained since 1944 .",

    "the geometrical distribution of [ ]  emission from the primary suggests a wind with a wide opening angle : the blueshifted and redshifted emission in figure  [ fig_rb ] is widely distributed , and in the diagram of @xmath49 ( figure  [ fig_vpeak]@xmath35 ) the blueshifted emission opens out in a ` v ' shape around the primary .",
    "the gap of 0@xmath72 between the primary and the redshifted emission can be explained by the optically thick circumstellar disk of uy aur a. the fwhm diameter of the star in our images was measured to be @xmath2  0@xmath714 .",
    "we have to be careful when interpreting structures within @xmath2  0@xmath71 of the star because the subtraction residuals associated with poission noise in the central region can hugely affect the structure .",
    "however , we can say that the blueshifted gas is spread over more than @xmath2  0@xmath72 radius .",
    "we note that a similar fast wind with a wide opening angle has been reported from at least one other young source , l1551 irs 5 @xcite .",
    "the complicated velocity structure in uy aur prevents us from easily identifying the origin of the various emission features .",
    "the high - velocity redshifted features labelled a and b in figure  [ fig_vpeak ] could be assocaited with the edges of a fast wind with a wide opening angle from uy aur a. feature ` c ' could then be an extension of feature ` a ' . with this model , however ,",
    "it is diffcult to explain the blueshifted emission seen between features a , b and c. this emission may be associated with a micro jet from the secondary , uy aur b. clearly , deeper observations with spatial and spectral resolutions comparable to those presented here are required in [ ]  to further probe this complex region .",
    "the elongated knot of redshifted emission labelled region ` c ' in figure  [ fig_vpeak ] may be associated with the primary rather than the secondary , i.e. it may be an extension of region ` a ' .",
    "the secondary may drive only a narrow blueshifted jet towards the north .",
    "deeper observations with spatial and spectral resolutions comparable to the presented studies are required in the [ ]  line to further probe this complex region .",
    "the absence of [ ]  emission at the south of the secondary ( within its roche lobe ) in figure  [ fig_rb]_b _ is curious .",
    "intrinsically existing emission could have been obscured by a gas - dust cloud ejected from the binary or the secondary .",
    "a notably large flux variation of the secondary may be caused buy such a cloud .",
    "for example , in 1992 it became 5 mag fainter than the primary in the r - band @xcite .",
    "the r - band magnitude difference ( @xmath59 m ) between the primary and secondary has changed by 6.6@xmath45 in 1996 @xcite and 2.0@xmath45 in 2000 @xcite . in the h - band ,",
    "the @xmath59 m changed 1.7@xmath45 in 1996 , 0.43@xmath45 in 2002 , and 1.7@xmath45 in 2005 .",
    "overall , the secondary has exhibited larger magnitude variations than the primary : @xmath151.3@xmath45 compared to @xmath150.3@xmath45 between 1996 - 2005 @xcite .",
    "these magnitude variations should be related to the changes in mass loss ( outflow ) and mass accretion rates .",
    "@xcite pointed out that a gas - dust cloud had obscured uy aur during 1945 - 1974 .",
    "this cloud may still be responsible to obscure uy aur b.    @xcite reported that the silicate spectrum of uy aur b is much flatter than expected",
    ". this may be the result of foreground extinction for an edge - on disk : the uy aur disk may be viewed edge - on , although such a disk has not been detected in direct imaging observations of uy aur b. thus the disk may not be precisely ` edge - on ' , i.e. , the inclination may be larger than @xmath2 15 degrees with respect to the line of sight .",
    "@xcite postulated that the mis - alignment of circumstellar disks in binary systems may be quite common in wide binaries ( with a @xmath60 100 au ) for class 0 , i , and ii phases .",
    "uy aur system may be an example of such a case .",
    "figure  [ fig_draw ] shows a schematic drawing of the uy aur system , illustrating our overall understanding of this remarkable object .",
    "our high spatial and high velocity resolutions nir integral field spectroscopy of the uy aur young interacting binary system show the following results :    1 .",
    "we detected  @xmath1  1.0830 @xmath0 m emission from both the primary and the secondary components of the binary , uy aur a and b. uy aur a shows deep blueshifted and redshifted absorptions with a central emission line which supports the stellar wind model interpretation of @xcite .",
    "uy aur b shows only emission , 25 times fainter than that of the primary .",
    "our observations suggest that uy aur a drives fast , blueshifted and redshifted [ ]  outflows with wide opening angles . between binary components",
    "a and b we observe complex velocity structure with overlapping blueshifted and redshifted emission features .",
    "we identified a gas ` bridge ' between the primary and secondary stars , although the high velocities observed along the edges of this feature support an outflow interpretation .",
    "uy aur b may then be associated with a blushifted micro - jet .",
