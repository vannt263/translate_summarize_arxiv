    "spicules are one of the most fundamental components of the solar chromosphere .",
    "they are seen in chromospheric spectral lines at the solar limb at speeds of about @xmath2  km  s@xmath3 propagating from the chromosphere into the solar corona @xcite .",
    "their diameter and length varies from spicule to spicule having the values from @xmath4  km to @xmath5  km and from @xmath6  km to @xmath7  km , respectively .",
    "the typical lifetime of them is @xmath8 min .",
    "the typical electron density at heights where the spicules are observed is approximately @xmath9 m@xmath10 , and their temperatures are estimated as @xmath11 k @xcite .",
    "@xcite by analyzing the height series of @xmath12 spectra in solar limb spicules observed their transverse oscillations with the estimated period of @xmath13 and @xmath14 s. more recently , @xcite based on _",
    "hinode_/sot observations estimated the oscillation period of spicule axis around @xmath15 s. + despite the large body of theoretical and observational works devoted to the spicules , their ejection mechanism is not clear yet . in other words , observations with high spatial resolutions are needed to distinguish their origin .",
    "the alfvn waves are usual candidates for energy transport from the lower layers of the solar atmosphere to the corona @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the alfvn waves may be nonlinearly coupled to fast magnetoacoustic shocks , which may lead to spicule formation .",
    "@xcite performed the numerical simulations of the propagation of alfvnic pulses in two dimensional magnetic field geometries .",
    "they concluded that for an alfvnic pulse the time at which different parts of the pulse emerge into the corona depends on the plasma density and magnetic field properties .",
    "moreover , they discussed that this mechanism can interpret spicule ejection forced through the transition region .",
    "@xcite used the random nonlinear alfvnic pulses and concluded that the transition region lifted up to more than @xmath16 km ( i.e. the spicule produced ) .",
    "@xcite studied the propagation and evolution of alfvnic pulses through coronal arcades .",
    "their results showed a strong spreading of the initially localized pulses due to variations of alfvn speed with height and efficient damping of oscillations .",
    "in addition , they concluded that the background density and alfvn speed should be considered as key ingredients in models .",
    "@xcite studied the upward propagation of a velocity pulse launched initially below the transition region .",
    "the pulse quickly steepens to a shock which may form the spicules .",
    "they concluded that such a model may explain speed , width , and heights of classical spicules .",
    "@xcite illustrated that impulsive motions may propagate along an intense tube .",
    "information ( in the form of a wave front ) propagates at the subsonic and subalfvnic tube speed . as the wave front of an impulsively generated disturbance propagates along the tube",
    ", it trails behind it a wake , which oscillates at cut - off frequency .",
    "the significance of cut - off frequency depends upon what are the circumstances creating the motions .",
    "if disturbances are impulsively generated , then wave propagation occurs and the existence of cut - off frequency is manifest in the creation of an oscillatory wake .",
    "@xcite examined the generation of waves in vertical flux tubes in the magnetic network through the impulsive excitation by granules .",
    "the buffering action of a granule on a flux tube at a certain level excites a pulse that travels away from the source region with tube speed . after the passage of the pulse , the atmosphere oscillates at the cut - off period of the mode , with amplitude that slowly decays in time .",
    "@xcite concluded that photospheric granulation may excite transverse pulses in anchored vertical magnetic flux tubes .",
    "the pulses propagate upward along the tubes while oscillating wake is formed behind the wave front in a stratified atmosphere .",
    "the pulses carry almost all the energy of initial perturbations , while the energy in wake oscillations is much smaller .",
    "+ in the present work we perform two - dimensional simulations of mhd equations and show that the alfvnic pulse which is launched below the transition region can excite alfvn waves and reach the height where spicules are observed . section @xmath17 gives the basic equations and theoretical model . in section @xmath18",

    "we keep effects of stratification due to gravity in @xmath17d x - z plane in the presence of steady flow and shear field .",
