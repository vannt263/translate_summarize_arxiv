    "to understand the physics underpinning the evolution of solar flares , it is necessary to understand the transport of mass , momentum , and energy through the solar atmosphere .",
    "the focus of the work presented here is to determine which component of the electron beam , assuming the thick - target model @xcite , is most important to powering the chromospheric evaporation that fills the corona with hot , soft x - ray emitting plasma .",
    "we do this by separating the electron beam into a set of isoenergetic beams and examining their relative efficiency at driving the flare .",
    "one outcome of this work is to show where future instrumentation should be most sensitive in order for progress to be made in understanding the coupling between the beam and the flare dynamics , particularly the threshold between gentle and explosive evaporation .    at the beginning of a solar flare , energy released from the magnetic field",
    "is partitioned between accelerated particles , _ in situ _ heating , and bulk motions in the plasma .",
    "the accelerated electrons stream down magnetic field lines , depositing their energy into the dense chromosphere via collisions with the ambient plasma .",
    "this energy deposition in turn drives an increase in the pressure of the chromosphere , causing an ablation of material and energy up along the field lines ( commonly called chromospheric evaporation , @xcite ) , creating arcades of hot , bright coronal loops .    under the thick - target model , all of the energy in an accelerated electron beam",
    "is deposited within the magnetic loop @xcite .",
    "the location of the energy deposition changes as the loop begins to fill due to chromospheric evaporation and the material front advances into the corona , thus decreasing the mean - free path of the streaming electrons .",
    "@xcite showed that an electron with energy @xmath0 will be stopped at a column density of around @xmath1 ( kev)@xmath2^{2}$ ] @xmath3 .",
    "since this depth changes in time as the density of the loop changes , and since the electron beam properties evolve ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , the location of energy deposition can help to elucidate the dynamics of flaring loops .",
    "this model necessarily assumes that the flare is compact and occurring on a single loop , whereas reconnection may drive the formation of many loops ( see @xcite ) .    the speed at which the material travels has been found to differ significantly depending on the strength of the beam .",
    "@xcite found that above a beam flux of about @xmath4 erg sec@xmath5 @xmath3 , material from the chromosphere explosively evaporates , _ i.e. _ material is driven up into the corona at a few hundred km sec@xmath5 .",
    "this explosive evaporation also drives a material front in the opposite direction , traveling more slowly but with much greater mass ( termed a chromospheric condensation ) . below the explosive threshold ,",
    "the material slowly ( @xmath6 30 km sec@xmath5 ) expands upward , raising the density of the corona slightly .",
    "however , @xcite make a few assumptions that we now inspect more closely .",
    "they assume that the beams last for 5 seconds , with a fixed energy flux , a fixed spectral index ( 4 ) , and a fixed low energy cut - off ( 20 kev ) , and they use a sharp cut - off distribution for the beam .",
    "it is not clear how consistent their results are for different values of the cut - off energy or for time - dependent values .",
    "one striking feature of fisher et al.s choice of values is that there is an abundance of high energy electrons , with none below 20 kev . in many observed flares ,",
    "however , there are accelerated electrons at energies as low as a few kev ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , so the results of @xcite would not apply . due to the sharpness of accelerated electron spectra",
    ", electrons below 20 kev dominate the energy flux , so the nature of explosive evaporation requires further investigation .",
    "many observations , with many different satellites , have confirmed the existence of explosive evaporation and significantly blue - shifted material in flares : solar maximum mission ( smm ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; naval research laboratory solar flares x - ray experiment ( solflex ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; yohkoh bragg crystal spectrometer ( yohkoh bcs @xcite ) ; hinode extreme ultraviolet imaging spectrometer ( hinode - eis ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) ; and recently the interface region imaging spectrograph ( iris ; @xcite ) .",
    "further , observations have shown that the hottest plasma travels faster than cooler plasma , with a clear relation between velocity and temperature ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ; @xcite ) .    with the advent of the rhessi satellite @xcite ,",
    "it has become routine to use observed bremsstrahlung emissions to derive the non - thermal electron distribution function from observations of solar flares @xcite .",
    "these electron spectra ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) can range in energy from a few kev to well over a few hundred kev . because they are described by a power - law in general ( with a negative slope )",
    ", there are significantly more low - energy electrons than high - energy electrons in the distribution .",
    "the shape of the electron distribution in observed solar flares is discussed in depth in @xcite . beneath a certain energy , referred to as the low - energy cut - off , or more simply the cut - off energy , the thermal emissions from the hot , dense plasma mask the non - thermal signatures of the electron beam .",
    "therefore , beneath that energy , the shape of the electron beam is uncertain .",
    "many different shapes for the electron beam have been assumed , including isoenergetic ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ; this paper ) , sharp cut - offs @xcite , and a low - energy power - law @xcite .",
    "more exotic , _ i.e. _ non - maxwellian , particle distributions have been suggested for solar flares that do not require unphysical assumptions about the distribution of the low energy electrons , such as the kappa distribution @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to consider the relative importance of high energy electrons versus low energy electrons in the heating process . in the extremely high energy limit",
    ", the stopping depth can extend deep into the solar atmosphere , where the energy deposited will be radiated away almost immediately , or , due to the large heat capacity , the electrons will make only a negligible contribution to the total thermal energy of the plasma .",
    "@xcite , for example , show that having a cut - off energy of greater than 100 kev leads to essentially no rise in temperature in a flare .",
    "this implies that sufficiently high energy electrons contribute little to flare heating , and that lower energy electrons dominate the energy deposition .",
    "the stopping depth of electrons is a straight - forward function of energy @xcite , so that by knowing the energy range of electrons that dominate the heating , the primary location of energy deposition , and thus the source of mass up - flows , can be determined . in this work ,",
    "the importance of electron energy on the dynamics of the flaring atmosphere is examined directly .    in order to develop an understanding of the hydrodynamic response to specific particle energies ,",
    "a number of studies have adopted an isoenergetic beam to examine the impact of accelerated electrons on the atmospheric response . in particular , @xcite studied the evolution of the energy and angle distributions of an initially isoenergetic electron beam in order to calculate the resultant bremsstrahlung spectra .",
    "@xcite adopted an isoenergetic neutralized ion beam , in order to study hard x - ray production , radio bursts , and the generation of langmuir waves , while limiting extraneous assumptions from their model .",
    "@xcite , under the observational consideration of centimeter - wavelength emissions , used an isoenergetic electron beam to consider large - scale effects without solving the fokker - planck equation for the distribution function in orderto study the production of radio emissions in solar flares . @xcite",
    "utilized an isoenergetic electron beam to simplify their model , physically and numerically , in order to study the hydrogen balmer line and return current formation , noting that the total current of the beam is more important than the shape of the distribution function .",
    "we similarly adopt heating due to an isoenergetic electron beam here .",
    "the idea is straightforward : if all the electrons in a beam are approximately the same energy , their stopping depths will be approximately equal .",
    "any changes in the atmospheric response can be attributed directly to electrons of that energy , and then compared / contrasted with beams of different electron energy .",
    "we wish to determine directly what range of electron energy is most effective at driving a solar flare .    in section [ sec : isoenergetic ]",
    ", the conditions for an isoenergetic beam are derived , which then form the basis of the numerical experiments . in section [ sec :",
    "isosims ] , simulations are performed to examine the atmospheric response to different isoenergetic beams . in section [ sec : samenumber ] , the importance of electron number flux is briefly examined . in section [ sec : evap ] , the threshold of explosive evaporation is examined at different electron energies .",
    "the main results are summarized and discussed in section [ sec : isoconclusions ] .",
    "we wish to determine the efficiency of electrons at various energies in driving the atmospheric response to heating by a beam . under the isoenergetic beam assumption",
    ", we can limit extraneous assumptions and focus on the key aspects that drive chromospheric evaporation .",
    "we couple this to a state - of - the - art hydrodynamic model in order to calculate key parameters : velocity flows , temperatures , and densities , all of which are readily observable .",
    "although electron spectra measured in observed flares are generally of the form of a sharp power - law , due to the steepness of the observed power - laws , most of the energy in a beam is concentrated close to the low - energy cut - off .",
    "thus , the isoenergetic assumption simplifies the problem and allows us to directly and thoroughly examine chromospheric evaporation .",
    "consider the case where an electron beam consists of electrons at nearly the same energy @xmath7 .",
    "then , the vast majority of the energy will be deposited at the same location ( same column depth ) . by employing isoenergetic beams we can assess the contributions made to the flare dynamics from the different energy deposition regions , free of confusion from coupled time dependence , spatial convolution , and velocity dispersion effects .    for these isoenergetic beams ,",
    "the following distribution is assumed : @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the initial electron energy , @xmath10 is the beam energy flux , and @xmath11 is the spectral index .",
    "the distribution function has a maximum at @xmath12 , dropping off as a power - law to either side of the maximum . assuming that @xmath13% of the electrons are within @xmath14 of the maximum of the distribution function , the condition would be : @xmath15    suppose the desired tolerance is that 99% of electrons are within @xmath14 of @xmath7 .",
    "then , the following condition must hold : @xmath16    solving , the spectral index @xmath11 must meet the following condition for the beam to be approximately isoenergetic ( within a 99% tolerance for @xmath17 ) : @xmath18    for example , for an electron energy of 5 kev , a spectral index @xmath19 is required for 99% of electrons to be within @xmath20 2 kev of @xmath7 .    note that these spectral indices are articially large , _",
    "i.e. _ observed beams have a larger spread in electron energy .",
    "however , in the case of a sharp cut - off at energy of 20 kev , assuming a spectral index of 5 , more than 50% of electrons are within 3 kev of the cut - off ( @xmath21 ) carrying around one third of the total energy .",
    "73% of the electrons , carrying more than 50% of the total energy , are within 6 kev of the cut - off .",
    "further , the mean electron energy is @xmath22 kev @xcite .",
    "so , although the isoenergetic case is extreme , even with a more modest spectral index , most of the electrons are concentrated near one energy .",
    "these equations are then combined with previously derived heating functions and bremsstrahlung emission calculations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "numerical experiments can then be run , and the dynamical response of the solar atmosphere and its radiative emission can be examined in detail .",
    "numerical experiments have been performed with the hydrad code @xcite to examine in detail the response of the atmosphere to isoenergetic beams , to determine the importance of different energy components of the beam to driving a flare .",
    "table [ isoenertable ] shows the details of 24 simulations , with maximal beam fluxes below ( @xmath23 erg sec@xmath5 @xmath3 ) , at ( @xmath4 erg sec@xmath5 @xmath3 ) , and above ( @xmath24 erg sec@xmath5 @xmath3 ) the canonical explosive evaporation threshold of @xcite .",
    "each simulation assumes an electron energy @xmath7 of [ 5 , 10 , 15 , 20 , 25 , 30 , 40 , 50 ] kev , with spectral indices derived from equation [ isoenergeticindex ] with a width of @xmath25 kev in all cases .",

    "first , consider the temperature plot . at every beam flux , lower electron energies",
    "lead to monotonically higher temperatures attained in the simulations .",

    "however , note that for all of the simulations below this threshold , the maximal apex density is approximately the same ( @xmath35 @xmath31 ) . since the total non - thermal energy content was the same in each simulation , this suggests that the amount of upflowing material does not depend strongly on the electron energy , below 40 kev .",
    "similarly at @xmath36 erg sec@xmath5 @xmath3 , for 15 kev and above , the density only increases slightly from the initial values , and there are correspondingly small velocities . at 5 and 10 kev ,",
    "though , the density reaches about @xmath36 @xmath31 , at speeds of just under 600 km sec@xmath5 ( for both simulations ) .",
    "importantly , these results imply that the lower energy electrons are more efficient than higher energy electrons at providing the corona with hot , dense plasma .    finally , consider the velocity plot , where a similar trend is found . at a given beam flux ,",
    "the highest velocities are attained by beams with the lowest energy electrons , in general .",
    "however , as might be expected from the density case , below a certain threshold , the velocities are approximately equal .",
    "for example , at @xmath32 erg sec@xmath5 @xmath3 , the maximal velocities at 5 , 10 , and 15 kev are all around 1200 km sec@xmath5 . by considering the pressure balances in the chromosphere ,",
    "@xcite derive the maximal speed attained by explosive evaporation to be around 2.35 @xmath37 ( the sound speed ) .",
    "assuming an ideal gas , this gives : @xmath38}\\ ] ]    for @xmath39 the boltzmann constant and @xmath40 the ion mass ( assumed to be hydrogen ) .",
    "for example , in the case of run 6 , for a temperature of around 20 mk , the speed works out to around 1170 km sec@xmath5 .",
    "similarly , for run 9 , at a temperature of about 8 mk , the equation gives a speed of 780 km sec@xmath5 .",
    "the maximal speeds at each energy @xmath7 in table [ evapsims ] are in agreement with the speed derived by @xcite .",
    "these results confirm the existence of two regimes of underlying physics : gentle and explosive evaporation . in the explosive evaporation case ,",
    "the momentum transport through the solar atmosphere strongly depends on both the beam flux and the electron energy .",
    "the maximal velocity of upflowing material is around @xmath41 , as derived by @xcite .",
    "however , the threshold between gentle and explosive evaporation _ also depends _ on the electron energy and can be estimated from these results .",
    "calling supersonic flows explosive ( see below for a more precise definition ) , and fitting a line in log - log space to the average of the upper and lower limits of the threshold , the following relation is found here : @xmath42    figure [ evapthresh ] shows the upper and lower limits obtained by the simulations in this section , listed in table [ evapsims ] , along with the fit to the data . in agreement with @xcite ,",
    "the threshold at 20 kev is @xmath43 erg sec@xmath5 @xmath3 .",
    "are plotted .",
    "a linear fit in log - log space to the average of the limits has been over - plotted , for comparison.,width=432 ]    this result can be derived analytically . following the definition of explosive evaporation found in @xcite ,",
    "the evaporation is explosive if the heating time scale is less than the hydrodynamic expansion time scale : @xmath44    for @xmath45 the heating rate ( erg sec@xmath5 ) , @xmath46 the length of the heated region , and @xmath37 the sound speed after heating .",
    "following @xcite , electrons with energy @xmath7 stop at a column density @xmath47 , where the variables are defined in that reference .",
    "substituting for @xmath48 and @xmath37 and solving : @xmath49    thus the threshold energy flux changes with the electron energy squared : @xmath50    the threshold of explosive evaporation depends quadratically on the electron energy and linearly on the energy flux .",
    "the numerical results do not agree precisely because of the sparse energy fluxes examined here .",
    "for example , at 20 , 25 , and 30 kev , the threshold is in the same range ( between 1 and @xmath32 erg sec@xmath5 @xmath3 ) , although it is clear from figure [ evapplots ] that a smaller electron energy results in larger velocities .",
    "in this work , the deposition of energy in the solar atmosphere by non - thermal electrons as the driving mechanism for solar flares has been examined . in order to study the transport of mass , momentum , and energy through the solar atmosphere , knowledge of the properties of the energy deposition and the detailed response of the atmosphere",
    "are crucial .",
    "observations have revealed accelerated electrons ranging in energy from a few kev to well over 100 kev ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "how the atmosphere responds to heating by an electron beam depends strongly on the properties of the beam , and thus upon the electrons that comprise the beam . to this end , isoenergetic beams (",
    "that is , beams composed of electrons all at the same energy ) have been used to understand the relative importance of the different components of the beam .",
    "the isoenergetic assumption is artificial because measured electron spectra in solar flares are generally found to be a sharp power - law in form .",
    "however , most of the energy in the beam is concentrated near the low - energy cut - off due to the sharpness of the spectra .",
    "the problem is thus simplified to assume that all of the electrons are found at one energy , which allows us to isolate the effects of energy deposition by electrons of varying energies . after deriving the necessary equations to model isoenergetic beams in section [ sec : isoenergetic ] ,",
    "simulations were carried out assuming otherwise realistic parameters in section [ sec : isosims ] .",
    "the electron beams were assumed to last for 5 minutes , with the energy pulse rising and falling for 150 seconds , reaching a peak energy flux consistent with observed quantities .",
    "the electron energies comprised a wide - range of energies , from 5 to 50 kev , well within observed bounds .",
    "the loops were assumed to be 50 mm in length , consistent with measurements of active region structures .",
    "\\1 . above the explosive evaporation threshold ,",
    "the response of the atmosphere does not strongly depend on the electron energy .",
    "although properties of the impulsive phase may still differ , during the gradual phase the densities and temperatures in the corona are fairly independent of the electron energy .",
    "lower energy electrons are significantly more efficient at heating the atmosphere . because their energy is deposited higher up ( towards the top of the chromosphere and transition region ) than higher energy electrons ,",
    "the deposited energy is comparable to the local thermal energy and less of the energy is lost through the efficient radiation deeper in the chromosphere .",
    "lower energy electrons drive up - flows sooner than higher energy electrons , although not necessarily with higher velocities .",
    "this may be because the higher coronal heating drives a thermal conduction front , contributing energy in addition to the chromospheric energy deposition , and/or because the lower density material has less inertia .",
    "since isoenergetic beams at different electron energies will carry different numbers of electrons , the importance of number flux was examined .",
    "it was found that the number flux is relatively unimportant compared to the total energy being carried by the beam .",
    "the energy flux carried by the beam dominates the response of the atmosphere , regardless of the number of electrons in that beam ( within sensible bounds , though ) .    finally , the results of section [ sec : isosims ] indicated that the explosive evaporation threshold depends upon the energy of the electrons comprising the beam . physically ,",
    "since higher energy electrons deposit their energy deeper down ( due to having a much longer mean - free path ) where the heat capacity and radiative losses are much higher , a beam with higher energy electrons will require significantly more total energy to drive explosive evaporation .",
    "as explained by @xcite , explosive evaporation is driven by a local over - pressure in the chromosphere , which forces material both upwards into the corona ( evaporation ) as well as deeper into the chromosphere ( condensation ) .",
    "accordingly , in section [ sec : evap ] many simulations , using parameters similar to the investigations of @xcite were performed .",
    "the simulations ranged from electron energies of 5 to 50 kev and beam fluxes from @xmath51 to @xmath24 erg sec@xmath5 @xmath3 .",
    "these demonstrated important results for heating driven by a thick - target model .",
    "the mass of up - flowing material depends strongly upon both the electron energy and the beam flux .",
    "low - energy electrons are more efficient at driving evaporation of hot , dense plasma into the corona than higher energy electrons .",
    "the amount of material transported through the solar atmosphere is limited once the beam is well above the explosive threshold , because the material is transported by the flows , which are limited in their speeds .",
    "we find that the more total energy that is carried by the beam , the more mass that is evaporated into the corona .",
    ". the momentum of up - flowing material also depends strongly upon both the electron energy and the beam flux .",
    "the speeds at which material up - flows depend strongly on the electron energy , with lower energy electrons more efficiently causing a drastic increase in the chromospheric pressure and thus the flow speeds . however , above the explosive evaporation threshold , the speed of up - flows is limited to @xmath41 @xcite , which holds regardless of the electron energy or flux .",
    "the simulation results were found to be in good agreement with this speed . due to the limitation in the speed of the bulk flows , the amount of material is limited as well .",
    "the energy transported likewise depends upon both the electron energy and the beam flux .",
    "lower energy electrons are more efficient at driving up - flows and thus providing hot , dense plasma to the corona , at all beam fluxes .",
    "lower energy electrons are also more efficient at heating the atmosphere , thus raising the temperatures more drastically .",
    "a larger beam flux more efficiently drives a stronger up - flow , similarly providing the corona with hot , dense plasma , at all electron energies .    from these three results ,",
    "we conclude that the threshold between explosive evaporation and gentle evaporation depends strongly upon the electron energy , as well as the beam flux ( figure [ evapthresh ] ) .",
    "we show analytically that the threshold depends quadratically upon the electron energy and linearly with the beam flux .",
    "lower energy electrons require significantly less energy to drive explosive evaporation , due to depositing energy higher in the atmosphere , which is assisted by thermal conduction .",
    "these results have implications on events smaller than flares , as well .",
    "electrons around 5 kev can drive explosive evaporation with very little total non - thermal energy . in observed microflares , x - ray brightenings with energy release about @xmath52 times that of a large flare @xcite",
    ", observations point to cut - off energies below 7 kev @xcite . even with non - thermal energies significantly smaller than solar flares",
    ", this leads to the possibility that explosive evaporation could occur in these microflares .",
    "for example , @xcite found recurring euv jets associated with microflares , with speeds up to @xmath53 km sec@xmath5 , which they attributed to chromospheric evaporation due to recurring magnetic reconnection .",
    "likewise , this may have further implications for nanoflares heated by a particle beam ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "there are still many features of energy deposition by electron beams that need to be examined in detail .",
    "it is necessary to understand the dependence of material flow speeds on the loop length , the duration of heating , the shape of the beam pulse , and the pitch angle distribution of the electrons",
    ". a wider range of simulations can explore all of these features directly and systematically .",
    "the insight provided here , however , has allowed for a clearer interpretation of the physics underpinning the heating and evolution of observed flares .",
    "in particular , we have gained a deeper understanding of the beam properties , the transport of mass , momentum , and energy through the solar atmosphere , and the interplay between the heating mechanisms and the atmospheric response .",

    "<S> in the standard model of solar flares , energy deposition by a beam of electrons drives strong chromospheric evaporation leading to a significantly denser corona and much brighter emission across the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> chromospheric evaporation was examined in great detail by @xcite , who described a distinction between two different regimes , termed explosive and gentle evaporation . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we examine the importance of electron energy and stopping depths on the two regimes and on the atmospheric response . </S>",
    "<S> we find that with explosive evaporation , the atmospheric response does not depend strongly on electron energy . in the case of gentle evaporation , </S>",
    "<S> lower energy electrons are significantly more efficient at heating the atmosphere and driving up - flows sooner than higher energy electrons . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the threshold between explosive and gentle evaporation is not fixed at a given beam energy flux , but also depends strongly on the electron energy and duration of heating . </S>",
    "<S> further , at low electron energies , a much weaker beam flux is required to drive explosive evaporation . </S>"
