    "until is a notoriously difficult temporal operator . this is because of its `` ambivalent '' nature of being an operator that is both existential and universal at the same time : @xmath0 holds at the current time instant ( sometimes `` world '' or `` state ''",
    "is used in place of `` time instant '' ) @xmath1 iff either @xmath2 holds at @xmath1 or there _ exists _ a time instant @xmath3 in the future at which @xmath2 holds and such that @xmath4 holds in _ all _ the time instants between the current one and @xmath3 .",
    "the words in emphasis highlight the dual existential and universal nature of @xmath7 , which poses a significant challenge when attempting to give deduction rules for until , so that deduction systems for temporal logics either deliberately exclude until from the set of operators considered or devise clever ways to formalize reasoning about until . and even if one manages to give rules , these often come at the price of additional difficulties for , or even the impossibility of , proving useful metatheoretic properties , such as normalization or the subformula property .",
    "( this is even more so in the case of hilbert - style axiomatizations , which provide axioms for until , but are not easily usable for proof construction . )",
    "see , for instance , @xcite , where techniques for formalizing suitable inference rules include introducing additional information ( such as the use of a skolem function @xmath8 to name the time instant where @xmath2 begins to hold ) , or exploiting the standard recursive unfolding of until @xmath9 which says that @xmath0 iff either @xmath2 holds or @xmath4 holds and in the successor time instant ( as expressed by the _ next _",
    "operator @xmath10 ) we have again @xmath0 .    in this paper , in contrast , we make explicit the duality of until by introducing a new temporal operator @xmath5 that allows us to formalize the `` history '' of until , i.e. ,  the fact that when we have @xmath11 the formula @xmath4 holds in all the time instants between the current one and the one where @xmath2 holds .",
    "we express this `` historic '' universal quantification by means of @xmath5 with respect to the following intuitive translation : @xmath12 that is : @xmath0 iff either @xmath2 holds or there exists a time instant @xmath3 in the future ( as expressed by the _ sometime in the future _",
    "operator @xmath13 ) such that    * @xmath2 holds in the successor time instant , and * @xmath4 holds in all the time instants between the current one and @xmath3 ( included ) .",
    "the latter conjunct is precisely what the _ history _ operator @xmath5 expresses that we achieve with @xmath5 is precisely what allows us to give well - behaved ( in a sense made clearer below ) natural deduction rules . ]",
    "this is better seen when introducing labeling : since @xmath5 actually quantifies over the time instants in an interval ( delimited by the current instant and the one where the @xmath2 of the until holds ) , we adopt a labeling discipline that is slightly different from the more customary one of labeled deduction .",
    "the framework of _ labeled deduction _ has been successfully employed for several non - classical , and in particular modal and temporal , logics , e.g. ,  @xcite , since labeling provides a clean and effective way of dealing with modalities and gives rise to deduction systems with good proof - theoretical properties .",
    "the basic idea is that labels allow one to explicitly encode additional information , of a semantic or proof - theoretical nature , that is otherwise implicit in the logic one wants to capture .",
    "so , for instance , instead of a formula @xmath4 , one can consider the _ labeled formula _",
    "@xmath14 , which intuitively means that @xmath4 holds at the time instant denoted by @xmath15 within the underlying kripke semantics .",
    "one can also use labels to specify how time instants are related , e.g. ,  the _ relational formula _",
    "@xmath16 states that the time instant @xmath17 is accessible from @xmath15 .    considering labels that consist of a single time",
    "instant is not enough for @xmath5 , as the operator is explicitly designed to speak about a sequence of time instants ( namely , the ones constituting the history of the corresponding until , if indeed @xmath5 results from the translation of an @xmath7 ) .",
    "we thus consider labels that are built out of a sequence of time instants , so that we can write @xmath18 to express , intuitively , that @xmath4 holds in the interval between time instants @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which together with the sub - sequence @xmath21 constitute a sequence of time instants @xmath22 .",
    "this allows us to give the natural deduction elimination rule @xmath23{\\alpha b_1 b_2 : a}{\\alpha b_1 b_3 : { \\nabla}a & b_1 { \\leqslant}b_2 & b_2 { \\leqslant}b_3}\\ ] ] that says that if @xmath24 holds at time instant @xmath20 at the end of the sequence @xmath25 and if @xmath26 is in - between @xmath19 and @xmath20 , as expressed by the relational formulas with the accessibility relation @xmath27 , then we can conclude that @xmath4 holds at @xmath26 .",
    "dually , we can introduce @xmath24 at time instant @xmath20 at the end of the sequence @xmath25 whenever from the assumptions @xmath28 and @xmath29 for a _ fresh _",
    "@xmath26 we can infer @xmath30 , i.e. is fresh means that @xmath26 is different from @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and does not occur in any assumption on which @xmath30 depends other than the discarded assumptions @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "] , : @xmath33{\\alpha b_1 b_3 : { \\nabla}a}{\\infer*{\\alpha b_1 b_2:a}{[b_1 { \\leqslant}b_2]\\ , [ b_2{\\leqslant}b_3]}}\\ ] ] the adoption of time instant sequences for labels has thus allowed us to give rules for @xmath5 that are well - behaved in the spirit of natural deduction  @xcite : there is precisely one introduction and one elimination rule for @xmath5 , as well as for the other connectives and temporal operators ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath10 ) .",
    "this paves the way to a proof - theoretical analysis of the resulting natural deduction systems , e.g. ,  to show proof normalization and other useful meta - theoretical analysis , which we are tackling in current work .",
    "moreover , the rules @xmath36 and @xmath37 provide a clean - cut way of reasoning about until , according to the translation , provided that we also give rules for @xmath13 and @xmath10 .",
    "these operators have a local nature , in the sense that they speak not about sequences of time instants but about single time instants .",
    "still , we can easily give natural deduction rules for them by generalizing the more standard `` single - time instant '' rules ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) using our labeling with sequences of time instants . as we will discuss in more detail below , if we collapse the sequences of time instants to consider only the final time instant in the sequence ( or , equivalently , if we simply ignore all the instants in a sequence but the last ) , then these rules reduce to the standard ones .",
    "for instance , for the _ always in the future _",
    "operator @xmath35 ( the dual of @xmath13 ) and @xmath10 , with the corresponding _ successor relation _",
    "@xmath38 , we can give the elimination rules @xmath39{\\alpha b_1 b_2 : a}{\\alpha b_1 : { \\mathsf{g}}a & b_1 { \\leqslant}b_2 }      \\qquad \\text{and } \\qquad       \\infer[{{\\mathsf{x}}e}]{\\alpha b_1b_2 : a}{\\alpha b_1 : { \\mathsf{x}}a & b_1 { \\lhd}b_2}\\ ] ] the rule @xmath40 says that if @xmath41 holds at time instant @xmath19 , which is the last in the sequence @xmath42 and @xmath26 is @xmath27-accessible from @xmath19 ( i.e. ,  @xmath31 ) , then we can conclude that @xmath4 holds for the sequence @xmath43 .",
    "the rule @xmath44 is justified similarly ( via @xmath38 ) .",
    "the corresponding introduction rules are given in section  [ sec : system ] , together with rules for @xmath45 and the connective @xmath34 , as well as a rule for induction on the underlying linear ordering .",
    "as we will see , we also need rules expressing the properties of the relations @xmath27 and @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , the fact that we consider sequences of time instants as labels requires us to consider some structural rules to express properties of such sequences ( with respect to formulas ) .",
    "this approach thus provides the basis for formalizing deduction systems for temporal logics endowed with the until operator . for concreteness , we give here a labeled natural deduction system for a linear - time logic endowed with the new history operator @xmath5 and show that , via a proper translation , such a system is also sound and complete with respect to the linear temporal logic @xmath6 with until .",
    "( we do not consider past explicitly here , but adding operators and rules for it should be unproblematic , e.g. ,  as in  @xcite . )",
    "we proceed as follows . in section  [ sec : ltl ] , we briefly recall the syntax and semantics of @xmath6 , and an axiomatization for it . in section  [ sec : ltlh ] , we define @xmath46 , the logic that is obtained from @xmath6 by replacing @xmath7 with the history @xmath5 , and give a validity - preserving translation , based on , from @xmath6 into @xmath46 . in section  [ sec :",

    "the rules for the introduction and the elimination of @xmath35 and @xmath10 share the same structure since they both have a `` universal '' formulation .",
    "consider , for instance , @xmath35 and the corresponding relation @xmath27 .",
    "the idea underlying the introduction rule @xmath141 is that the meaning of @xmath162 is given by the metalevel implication @xmath163 for an arbitrary @xmath26 @xmath27-accessible from @xmath19 ( where the arbitrariness of @xmath26 is ensured by the side - condition on the rule ) . as we remarked above , the operators @xmath35 and @xmath10 have a local nature , in that when we write @xmath164 ( and similarly for @xmath165 ) we are stating that @xmath41 holds at time instant @xmath19 , which is the last in the sequence @xmath42 .",
    "hence , the elimination rule @xmath40 says that if @xmath26 is @xmath27-accessible from @xmath19 ( i.e. ,  @xmath31 ) , then we can conclude that @xmath4 holds for the sequence @xmath43 .",
    "similar observations hold for @xmath10 and the corresponding relation @xmath38 .",
    "the rule @xmath146 models the fact that every time instant has an immediate successor , while the rule @xmath166 specifies that such a successor must be unique . @xmath146 tells us that if assuming @xmath142 we can derive @xmath82 , then we can discharge the assumption and conclude that indeed @xmath82 .",
    "@xmath166 is slightly more complex : assume that @xmath19 had two different immediate successors @xmath26 and @xmath20 ( which we know can not be ) and assume that the generic formula @xmath90 holds ; if by substituting @xmath20 for @xmath26 in @xmath90 we obtain @xmath82 , then we can discharge the assumption and conclude that indeed @xmath82 .    similarly , the rules @xmath167 and @xmath168 state the reflexivity and transitivity of @xmath27 , while @xmath169 captures substitution of equals.$ ] from @xmath90 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 . ] the rule @xmath147 states that if @xmath31 , then either @xmath172 or @xmath173 .",
    "the rule thus works in the style of a disjunction elimination : if by assuming either of the two cases , we can derive a formula @xmath82 , then we can discharge the assumptions and conclude @xmath82 . since we do not use @xmath174 and @xmath175 explicitly in our syntax , we express such relations in an indirect way : the equality of @xmath19 and @xmath26",

    "this rule expresses what we also anticipated in the introduction : the standard operators ( and connectives ) of @xmath6 speak not about sequences of time instants but about single time instants , and thus if a formula @xmath4 whose outermost operator is not @xmath5 holds at @xmath181 , then we can safely replace @xmath182 by any other sequence @xmath21 and conclude that @xmath4 holds at @xmath180 . to formalize this",

    "moreover , we are also considering different optimizations of the rules .",
    "in particular , along the lines of the discussion about the rule @xmath144 ( and corollary  [ cor : last ] and definition  [ def : vdashltl ] ) , we are investigating to what extent we can use sequences as labels only when they are really needed , which would also simplify the proofs of normalization and other meta - properties , i.e. ,  considering @xmath145 and @xmath187 , is closely related , at least in spirit , to the focus on _ persistent _ formulas when combining intuitionistic and classical logic so as to avoid the collapse of the two logics into one , see  @xcite but also  @xcite .",
    "we are , after all , considering here formulas stemming from two classes ( if not two logics altogether ) , and it makes thus sense that they require different labeling ( single instants and sequences ) . ] .",
    "this is closely related to the formalization of the relationship between the class of @xmath183-formulas and that of @xmath6-formulas , which in turn will allow us to reason about the completeness of @xmath47 with respect to the semantics of @xmath46 and also to provide an axiomatization of @xmath46 ( thus treating it as a full - fledged logic as opposed to as a `` service '' logic for @xmath6 as we did here ) .",
    "finally , it is worth observing that several works have considered _ interval temporal logics _ , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "while these works consider intervals explicitly , we have used them somehow implicitly here , as a means to formalize the dual nature of until via the history @xmath5 , and this is another reason why it is interesting to reduce the use of label sequences as much as possible .",
