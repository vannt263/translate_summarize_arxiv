    "therefore , it is natural to look for a technique that permits avoiding this approximation and dealing with the original shape of the lamp characteristic drawn at fig  [ char]a that expects to give more accurate correspondence between theoretical and experimental results .",
    "moreover , a wide class of physical systems is modelled by circuit fig  [ thom ] whose lamp either has or has not a saturation that leads to the characteristic drawn at figures [ char]b and [ char]c respectively .",

    "this promises to forestall some numerical simulations ( e.g. to work out interesting parameters of the driven chua s circuit ) giving a significant impact for further experiments .        for a large extent the phenomenal interest in generalizing of the second bogolubov",
    "s theorem for the lipschitzian case comes from mechanics , where systems with piecewise linear stiffness describe various oscillating processes .",
    "a prototypic process of this type is exhibited by the device drawn at fig .",
    "[ spr]a where a forced mass is attached to a spring whose stiffness changes from @xmath44 to @xmath45 when the mass coordinate crosses @xmath46 in the negative direction .",

    "[ spr]a various terms can stay for @xmath49 in ( [ spring ] ) .",
    "it is @xmath50 with piecewise constant @xmath51 for shock - absorber and jigging conveyor ( see @xcite , ch.i , p.16 and ch.iv , p.100 where original second bogolubov s theorem is employed without justification ) .",
    "levinson s change of variables ( see transformation of eq .",
    "( [ two ] ) above ) allows to rewrite ( [ spring ] ) as a lipschitz system .",
    "it takes simpler form @xmath52 for an impact resonator and @xmath53 for a cracked - body model ( see @xcite and @xcite , where numerical experiments are performed solely ) . in each of these situations equation ( [ spring ] ) can be rewritten as system ( [ ps ] ) with lipschitzian @xmath13 provided that the constant @xmath54 and the amplitude of the force @xmath49 are sufficiently small .",
    "therefore the related generalization of the second bogolubov s theorem promises to justify or explain the resonances appeared in the cited results .",

    "the question what happens with these solutions when @xmath66 appears to be the same magnitude small as @xmath63 and @xmath68 , is open for a while and can be resolved by means of the generalization of the second bogolubov s theorem we propose .",
    "lazer and mckenna proved in @xcite that the poincar map for ( [ bridge ] ) is differentiable , but we note that it is not an enough argument to apply the original second bogolubov s theorem since it requires the differentiability of functions participating in ( [ bridge ] ) as well .    at the end of the applications review",

    "thus , analogous to chua s circuit applications of the result of this paper are also possible to these mechanical systems .",
    "it was mitropolskii who first noticed that various applications require generalization of the second bogolubov s theorem for lipschitz right hand parts . assuming that @xmath13 is lipschitz , @xmath69 and that all the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath17 have negative real part mitropolskii developed the second bogolyubov s theorem proving the existence and uniqueness of a @xmath7periodic solution of system ( [ ps ] ) in a neighborhood of @xmath70 there was a great progress weakening the assumptions of mitropolskii in his existence result ( see samoylenko @xcite and mawhin @xcite ) , but not of his uniqueness result .",
