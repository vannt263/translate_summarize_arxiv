    "hess measurements of tev fluxes from sgr a@xmath1 @xcite confirm , with high significance , earlier reports by the whipple @xcite and cangaroo @xcite collaborations ( albeit at higher flux levels than hess ) about tev emission from the galactic center .",
    "this result adds important new information about the massive ( @xmath8 ; @xcite ) bh at the center of the galaxy . when combined with the wealth of observational data in the radio to x - ray wavebands @xcite , the tev @xmath0-ray data point to a scenario involving an inner , inefficiently radiating magnetized corona , i.e.   the adaf , and a subrelativistic outflow of particles and field from the adaf . as in pulsar plerions like crab nebula ( see @xcite ) , the wind terminates at a shock , at @xmath9 from the gcbh , to create a black - hole powered ` plerion ' where the tev radiation is produced .",
    "the vlbi size of the radio source at the location of sgr  a@xmath10is @xmath11as at @xmath12 and @xmath13as at @xmath14 @xcite . using vlba ,",
    "@xcite resolve sgr  a@xmath10at 42 ghz to have an angular size of @xmath15 , or @xmath16 for @xmath17 black hole and a gc distance @xmath18 , and find that the size increases with wavelength .",
    "the radio emission of sgr  a@xmath10is rather stable , with total luminosity @xmath19 and spectral flux @xmath20 that sharply falls off above @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "the near - infrared ( nir ) flares show factors - of-2 flux variations on timescales of @xmath22min and reach powers of @xmath23 @xcite . the spectra rise in @xmath24 diagrams , and show powers @xmath23 , similar with the ( _ nonsimultaneously _ ) detected x - ray flares @xcite .",
    "the 200s x - ray variability timescale limits the engine size to @xmath25 . the unabsorbed quiescent flux detected by chandra observatory from sgr  a@xmath10is @xmath26@xmath27 , and has angular extent @xmath28 @xcite , corresponding to source size @xmath29 .",
    "the tev spectral fluxes in two hess campaigns in june / july and july / august of 2003 are almost exactly the same , extending with photon index @xmath30 - 2.3 from @xmath31gev to 10 tev , with total power @xmath32 .",
    "there is no sign of flux variation within the statistics available in each of these sets @xcite .",
    "given the high statistical significance of the signal in both data sets , these results suggest a quiescent or quasi - stationary tev source coincident within @xmath33 of sgr a@xmath1 .",
    "we propose a model for sgr a@xmath1 where the quasi - stationary radio and flaring x - ray / nir emissions are synchrotron radiation from the adaf .",
    "the mhd wind from the adaf powers a black - hole plerion where the quiescent x - ray and tev emissions are produced by electrons accelerated at the wind shock .",
    "the model explains the existing multi - wavelength data , and makes predictions that can be checked by various x - ray and gamma - ray detectors .",
    "the dimensionless mass - accretion rate ( or eddington ratio ) @xmath34 is defined in units of the eddington luminosity @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the maximum efficiency of gravitational - to - photon energy conversion by the bh . in the adaf model @xcite , thermal radiation of the accretion plasma at the level @xmath37",
    "is predicted when @xmath38 .",
    "the rate @xmath39 is obtained if one formally equates @xmath40 with the observed @xmath41 .    the compact radio emission can not originate from an optically - thick accretion disk which would only be allowed at @xmath42 , or from a much hotter adaf plasma at smaller scales , but is compatible with a synchrotron origin @xcite .",
    "the thermal output of the adaf would be peaked mostly in the hard x - ray / soft gamma - ray domain , where the quiescent luminosity is at least 2 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath43 .",
    "this results in the accretion rate estimate @xmath44 consistent with adaf model and sgr  a@xmath10observations . even for @xmath45 this small",
    ", @xmath46 of accretion power is still either advected into the bh or escapes as an outflow .",
    "adopting gcbh mass @xmath47 , the adaf magnetic field at radii @xmath48 is @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the ratio of the magnetic to the total pressure in the accreting gas and @xmath51 is the viscosity parameter . using @xmath52 and @xmath53 @xcite , the magnetic field @xmath54 g in the adaf at @xmath55 is found . for these fields ,",
    "the lorentz factor of electrons producing synchrotron radiation peaked at @xmath56 is @xmath57 , and the adaf is still transparent to self - absorption for @xmath58 radiation .    a stochastic acceleration model for the radio - mm emission from sgr  a@xmath10@xcite",
    "can be quantified using the second - order fermi acceleration theory of @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field is defined through the relation @xmath59 , implying @xmath60 @xmath61 g for a region of size @xmath62 .",
    "equating the acceleration rate of electrons by whistler turbulence with the synchrotron loss rate gives a characteristic electron lorentz factor @xmath63 , assuming a kolmogorov spectrum for the turbulence .",
    "here @xmath64 is the fractional whistler turbulent energy density compared to @xmath65 , and @xmath66 is the thomson depth of the adaf , assumed to be composed of e - p plasma .",
    "values of @xmath67 g and @xmath68 are implied for the adaf when @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "a compton ( i.e. , leptonic ) origin for non - variable tev flux detected with hess implies that the synchrotron counterpart of that flux is the quiescent component of the x - ray flux .",
    "the magnetic - field energy density in the source should then be @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the energy density of the target photons at @xmath74 . inside the radio source , at @xmath75 , the radiation energy density saturates at the level @xmath76 .",
    "thus , the origin of tev flux at those small distances would require magnetic fields @xmath77 , far below the adaf model values .    in the adios ( `` advection - dominated inflow - outflow solution '' @xcite ) extension of the adaf model , the outflow may carry a significant fraction of the generated kinetic energy of the plasma from the bh vicinity to large distances .",
    "we assume a wind of magnetized accretion plasmas with total power @xmath78 propagating in a two - sided cone with opening angle @xmath79 at speed @xmath80 ; for calculations we use @xmath81 .",
    "this wind terminates at a subrelativistic shock at @xmath82 from the gcbh .",
    "the shock accelerates electrons to energies @xmath83 to produce the observed tev @xmath0-rays by compton upscattering of sub - mm ( @xmath21 ) photons from the adaf .",
    "another important photon target is the emission from the cold ( @xmath84 ) dust ring of sgr a west , with total luminosity @xmath85 in the central arcmin ( few _ pc _ ) region around sgr  a@xmath10@xcite .",
    "this radiation has a spectral peak at @xmath86 and estimated energy density @xmath87 .",
    "it becomes the main contributor to the @xmath88 compton flux from the plerion at @xmath89 from sgr a@xmath1 .",
    "synchrotron radiation from these same multi - tev electrons at @xmath90 produces the quiescent x - ray flux from sgr a@xmath1 .",
    "chandra observations @xcite reveal diffuse thermal x - rays with luminosity @xmath91 from the central parsec region of sgr a@xmath1 , produced by @xmath92 plasma with @xmath93 density , where @xmath94 is the volume filling factor . equating the gas pressure @xmath95 in that region with the energy density of the wind gives the shock distance @xmath96 the tev luminosity @xmath97 implies a total electron acceleration power @xmath98 .",
    "assuming that the efficiency of electron acceleration @xmath99 , and letting the rest go to thermal plasma and nonthermal protons ( unlike in pulsar winds where relativistic electrons dominate ) , we arrive at @xmath100 .",
    "note that eq.(3 ) predicts that the maximum power of the outflow sustainable at distances @xmath82 is @xmath101 .",
    "the mean fluid speed @xmath102 in the tev plerion formed downstream of the shock can be derived from @xmath103 , where @xmath104 is the compton cooling time of electrons producing synchrotron x - rays with energy @xmath105 for the estimated magnetic field @xmath106 in the gcbh plerion at scales @xmath107 .",
    "taking @xmath108 for the median distance of the tev plerion , we find @xmath109 at those distances .    since relativistic electrons of all energies convect with the fluid at the same speed , the tev plerion model predicts shrinking of the quiescent x - ray source size at higher energies .",
    "note also that the opening angle of the outflow should be @xmath110 rather than @xmath111 , since otherwise @xmath112 would exceed @xmath113 .",
    "this indicates that the energy outflow is in the form of a wind rather than well - collimated jet .",
    "fig .  1 shows numerical calculations of the quiescent radiation components of sgr  a@xmath114 .",
    "these include synchrotron and ssc emission from the magnetized adaf within @xmath115 of the gcbh ( _ dashed curves _ ) , x - ray and tev emission from the compact plerion at scales @xmath116  @xmath117 ( _ solid curves _ ) , and the emission from the larger plerion ( _ dot - dashed curves _ ) inflated to _ pc _ scales in the process of convective ( and possibly also diffusive ) propagation of the accelerated electrons on timescales @xmath118",
    ". magnetic field in the latter , @xmath119 , is assumed higher than @xmath120 in the tev plerion .",
    "this is in agreement with the expected increase of the magnetic field downstream of the shock in typical pulsar plerions @xcite , and is explained by deceleration and compression of the plasma .",
    "but it is also possible that @xmath121 , in which case a smaller synchrotron flux from the @xmath122-scale plerion than shown in fig .  1 is predicted .",
    "the inset in fig .",
    "1 shows the nonthermal electron distributions . besides synchrotron and compton losses",
    ", calculations also include coulomb and bremsstrahlung losses in a medium with @xmath123 characteristic for central @xmath122 regions of sgr  a@xmath114 .",
    "electrons with a power - law injection index @xmath124 and an exponential cutoff above @xmath125 are injected into 2-sided nebula with total power @xmath126 .",
    "these electrons radiatively cool downstream of the shock and propagate to distances @xmath127 on the timescale @xmath128yr , during which most of the injected energy of the multi - tev electrons ( producing tev and x - ray fluxes observed ) has been already lost .",
    "the radio emission is produced at @xmath129 in @xmath130 field by a relativistic maxwellian electron distribution @xmath131 with @xmath132 resulting from a balance between second - order energy gains and synchrotron losses @xcite .",
    "the stochastic acceleration power of radio electrons is therefore about equal to the observed radio luminosity @xmath43 .",
    "the ssc emission component of these electrons , shown in fig .",
    "1 by the dashed curve , falls in the sub - kev region below the level of the quiescent x - ray flux .",
    "however , if magnetic fields @xmath133 g are assumed , this ssc contribution would rise and also move to 1 kev , and could contribute to radiation at that energies .",
    "it can not , however , explain the entire quiescent flux extending to 10 kev .    the powerful x - ray and nir flares observed from sgr  a@xmath10are explained in our model by the onset of instabilities of the accretion flow at distances of only few @xmath134 .",
    "they result in strong shocks in the accretion flow and effective acceleration of particles advected with the flow .",
    "the accelerated particles are then easily taken out of this region in the wind / jet outflow .",
    "synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated to @xmath135 explains the x - ray flares with very short variability scales .",
    "furthermore , while propagating through the first few tens of @xmath134 , these electrons have sufficient time , @xmath136 , to cool in the high @xmath137 fields there down to @xmath138 to produce flares in the nir domain .",
    "self - absorbed flares at @xmath139 detected on @xmath140day timescales after the x - ray flares @xcite could be explained by the radiation from these same electrons at later stages / larger distances of the outburst in the ` expanding source ' scenario .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the flare fluxes expected in this model . after shock - acceleration close to the bh and injection into collimated wind outflow with speed @xmath141 , electrons propagate through the inner @xmath14210 - 30 region on timescale @xmath143 , after which the radiation losses drop because of wind expansion and decline of @xmath137 .",
    "the solid , dashed , and dot - dashed curves show synchrotron and compton fluxes produced at times 200s , 1200s and 1hr after the onset of the flare .",
    "the electron injection time profile is @xmath144 , with @xmath145 .",
    "the mean magnetic field in adaf outflow could be enhanced at the flaring state , so we take @xmath146 .",
    "the compton fluxes shown ( thin curves ) clearly demonstrate that no detectable tev flares should be expected during powerful x - ray flares .",
    "this is in agreement with the non - detection of tev flux variations during many days of observation with the hess telescopes , whereas the x - ray flares occur with frequency of @xmath147 per day @xcite .",
    "a model consisting of magnetized coronal adaf ( synchrotron ) radio emission within @xmath148 of the gcbh , and of a black - hole plerion powered by a wind from the adaf resolves many puzzling observations of sgr a@xmath1 .",
    "x - ray flares are synchrotron radiation of electrons accelerated through first - order fermi process by shocks within a few @xmath149of the gcbh .",
    "electrons accelerated to @xmath150 at the wind termination shock at @xmath151 cm creates the gcbh plerion .",
    "its synchrotron x - ray emission has been resolved as an @xmath152 source with chandra @xcite .",
    "the multi - tev electrons compton scatter the radio photons from sgr  a@xmath10and fir photons from the dust ring of sgr a west to produce the tev emission .",
    "tev emission from the gcbh plerion is nearly stationary because the cooling time of tev electrons is @xmath153 yrs .",
    "a  jet - adaf \" model for sgr  a@xmath10has been proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our model , though also based on energy outflow from the adaf , differs greatly .",
    "in particular , the quiescent and flaring x - ray components are produced at different sites .",
    "the origin of the x - ray and nir flares are explained as synchrotron emission of electrons accelerated during episodes of instabilities very close to the bh , not as compton radiation in the ssc scenario of the  jet - adaf \" model .",
    "importantly , the tev flux can not be easily explained if the observed x - rays were due to the ssc mechanism in the vicinity of the gcbh , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "propagation of gev electrons from the plerion on timescales of @xmath154 with speeds @xmath155could significantly contribute to the radio synchrotron flux of sgr a west .",
    "in particular , it could explain the suggested nonthermal origin of radiation in the bar of sgr a west @xcite , formed in the outflow direction .",
    "we also predict that quasi - stationary compton and bremsstrahlung fluxes from the pc - scale plerion , coincident with the central parts of sgr a west , will be significantly detected and possibly resolved with glast at gev energies .",
    "but the expected highly variable compton counterpart of the synchrotron x - ray flares from the gcbh vicinity is too weak to be detectable with glast or hess .",
    "the synchrotron extension of the flare emission in the hard x - ray / soft @xmath0-ray domain explains the @xmath156min episode of a profound increase of flux detected by integral from the direction of sgr  a@xmath10@xcite .",
    "the absence of apparent tev flux variations may suggest a proton origin for the tev radiation @xcite .",
    "indeed , proton and ion acceleration through first- and second - processes in the adaf and through first - order acceleration at the wind termination shock could make cosmic rays to produce tev emission through nuclear @xmath157-interactions with @xmath158 dense gas on @xmath122 scales , and could form extended tev emission possibly already detected with hess @xcite .",
    "the hadronic origin of the tev radiation in the adaf itself in the bh vicinity requires , however , an extremely dense gas target or extremely large proton powers @xmath159 .",
    "finally , we note that the unidentified egret source 3eg j1746 - 2851 towards the gc @xcite is significantly displaced @xcite from the direction of the gcbh , and is unlikely to be related to sgr a@xmath1 .",
    "it is probably emission from a young pulsar , though not with the  mouse \" psr j1747 - 2958 @xcite .",
    "a young pulsar with @xmath0-ray properties like vela but with apparent @xmath0-ray power @xmath160 larger could have been missed in pulsar surveys due to the large dispersion measure towards the gc .",
    "we suggest a deeper , higher radio - frequency and x - ray search at the refined location of 3eg j1746 - 2851 .",
