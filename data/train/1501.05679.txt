    "the far - field absorption and emission spectra are standard experimental tools in the characterization of excitonic systems .",
    "the temperature and solvent dependence of these spectra are often used to extract a wealth of information on , for example , the microscopic geometry of the constituent chromophores , the coupling strength between the excitonic system and its environment , as well as the relative importance of heterogeneous broadening mechanisms.@xcite despite this wide applicability , at present there are still relatively few theoretical approaches that are capable of providing uniformly reliable estimates of the spectra of open quantum systems . only in the limiting case that the spectrum arises from a single isolated electronic transition",
    "can the exact absorption and emission spectrum be obtained analytically ( up to a numerical integration ) through cumulant expansion techniques.@xcite however , in the more common setting , wherein the excitonic complexes are comprised of multiple coupled chromophores , then one must , in general , resort to numerical methods .",
    "unfortunately , there is no numerically exact approach currently available for systems containing more than a few chromophores that is valid over a large range of the parameter space . as a result ,",
    "comparisons between many interesting experimental systems and their corresponding microscopic theoretical models are often out of reach .",
    "one of the central aims of this work is to fill this gap . here",
    "we present an efficient path integral approach that allows one to compute the numerically exact absorption and emission spectra of multi - chromophoric open quantum systems .",
    "due to the lack of robust exact methods , one often turns to perturbative techniques . as detailed in the preceding papers of this series ( henceforth referred to as papers i@xcite and ii@xcite ) many of the standard approximate approaches are capable of generating reliable absorption spectra , as only the short time dynamics of a factorized system - environment initial state are required .",
    "the emission spectrum , however , presents a much more challenging problem . in this case",
    ", the real - time dynamics evolve from the correlated equilibrium state of the entire excitonic system and its environment .",
    "unless the system - bath coupling is very weak , perturbative treatments often generate qualitatively incorrect emission spectra , and generally become even worse as the temperature is lowered.@xcite one of the major results of the previous papers in this series was a hybrid perturbative method capable of providing reliable emission spectrum over a broad range of system parameters.@xcite the approach is not fully perturbative in that it combines the knowledge of the numerically exact equilibrium reduced density matrix which can be obtained relatively easily through imaginary time path integral methods@xcite with an approximate cumulant expansion of the remaining real time dynamics .",
    "this initial state correction becomes essential at low temperatures or strong coupling .",
    "the hybrid cumulant expansion ( hce ) thus greatly extends the parameter regimes accessible to perturbative methods and generally improves the quality of the results .    in the context of numerically exact treatments of the emission spectrum , such as the hierarchy equation of motion ( heom ) or quasi - adiabatic path integral approach ( quapi),@xcite the problem of a correlated system - bath initial state",
    "is overcome by simply preparing a factorized state sufficiently far in the past such that the system has reached equilibrium at time zero . as a result ,",
    "these approaches require an initial lengthy propagation of the reduced density matrix to equilibrium before the dynamics of the dipole correlation function can be calculated.@xcite furthermore , as these approaches rely on efficient representations of the influence functional , they are generally restricted to environments that are not strongly non - markovian .",
    "the main result of this paper is a stochastic path integral approach that circumvents many of the restrictions imposed by other numerically exact methods , and in particular , is applicable for arbitrary spectral densities and temperatures .",
    "while an exact calculation of the absorption and emission spectra is important in its own right , it also provides an additional benefit .",
    "that is , one can immediately compute energy transfer rates between weakly coupled excitonic systems using the multi - chromophoric frster resonant energy transfer ( mcft ) formalism .",
    "the mcft framework is a generalization of the standard frster theory to the situation where the donor or acceptor complex consists of multiple coupled chromophores,@xcite and has gained recent attention as this scenario appears to be one of most common motifs employed in the highly efficient energy transfer networks found in biological systems .",
    "for example , the light harvesting systems found in both green and purple bacteria are comprised of independent complexes of strongly coupled chromophores that form the base units for large - scale energy transfer networks.@xcite    in sec .",
    "[ sec : formalism ] the details of the mcft formalism are presented .",
    "there it becomes apparent that the key quantities necessary for computing energy transfer rates are generalized operators related to the absorption spectrum of the acceptor complex and the emission spectrum of the donor",
    ". then we present the path integral treatment of the absorption operator and demonstrate that it may be efficiently computed as the solution to a straightforward stochastic differential equation .",
    "this approach is then generalized to the emission spectrum by taking advantage of the detailed balance condition that relates the emission operator to its corresponding absorption operator evolving in a complex time .",
    "following these formal developments , numerical calculations are presented for model two level systems that can be reliably benchmarked against the heom approach . the temperature dependence of the emission spectrum is presented , followed by systematic calculations of the mcft rate as a function of the temperature and system - bath coupling strength .",
    "it is observed that the hybrid cumulant expansion technique developed in paper ii is the only perturbative approach that provides uniformly reliable results for the energy transfer rates.@xcite in a forthcoming work , the path integral and hce methods will be used to provide the first systematic analysis of the energy transfer rates between two b850 complexes in the light harvesting system lh2.@xcite",
