    "so far the entire notion of the existence of dark matter ( dm ) has been based on the manifestations of its gravitational effects at cosmological scales , ranging from the observations of galactic rotation curves to the measurements of the anisotropy of the cmbr @xcite .",
    "many different theoretical models of dark matter @xcite suffer from a lack of direct experimental measurements that could reveal the nature of dm in interactions other than gravitational .",
    "several direct dark matter search experiments  @xcite have created a rather controversial situation , from one side excluding weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) in the range of masses @xmath3  6 gev with the weak coupling strength to the target particles of ordinary matter ( om ) , and from another side claiming signals of dark matter detection in a lower mass range than expected in the popular supersymmetric models @xcite . on the other hand , experiments at the large hadron collider",
    "so far have not been able to find wimp candidates that could be candidates for a single - component dm  @xcite .",
    "the general difficulty in identifying the nature of dark matter is the lack of non - controversial and reproducible effects of non - gravitational interactions between the dm and om particles .    in this paper",
    "we would like to discuss a new , simple particle physics experiment with neutrons that could test one of the dm models of specific interest .",
    "in this model , dm ( in whole or at least in some fraction ) consists of mirror matter ( mm ) from a hidden gauge sector that represents an exact copy of the ordinary particle sector .",
    "the concept of mirror fermions was introduced in 1956 as a way to restore parity in a seminal paper by lee and yang , while in 1966 kobzarev , okun and pomeranchuk showed that mirror fermions can not have common strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions with ordinary fermions and thus the former can exist in the form of an independent parallel sector which they coined as mirror world @xcite . from today",
    "s view , once the ordinary matter and its interactions are described by the standard model ( sm ) , then the mirror particle content and interactions are described by another copy of ( sm@xmath4 ) .",
    "it can be equivalently viewed as , if in the context of extra dimensions , the om and mm are localized on two parallel branes with corresponding sm and sm@xmath4 self - interactions , while the gravity propagating through the bulk interacts with both types of matter .",
    "thus mm and om interact gravitationally , providing observable manifestations of dm effects , but they have no common sm and sm@xmath4 interactions ; in fact , renormalizable interaction terms between particles of two sectors are forbidden by the particle content of the standard model , in the same way as renormalizable interactions violating baryon or lepton numbers . however , in difference from cold dark matter candidates , mm is self - interacting and dissipative matter in the same sense as om .",
    "once mm is adopted as a framework for dm , then the properties of mm with respect to particle content and interactions are well known by the model requirement of sm @xmath5 sm@xmath4 . on the other hand",
    ", the cosmological genesis and galactic evolution might be different between mm and om due to differences in abundance and temperature of the two sectors and the obvious lack of observational details in the mirror sector .",
    "many aspects of the mm cosmology were discussed and explained in the literature @xcite .",
    "although these aspects are not broadly assimilated , the mirror matter hypothesis remains a viable option for dm .",
    "a detailed discussion of the viability of the mm model is not in the scope of this paper .",
    "the interested reader can learn these ideas e.g. from reviews @xcite .",
    "important for this paper are two aspects of mm .",
    "first , it was conjectured that the neutral particles of the om and mm sectors , elementary like neutrinos or composite like neutrons , can be mixed , providing an interaction portal between the two sectors .",
    "namely , the kinetic mixing of ordinary and mirror photons , first discussed in @xcite , which makes mirror matter effectively mini - charged with respect to the ordinary electromagnetic forces . though the kinetic mixing is severely restricted by cosmological limits @xcite , it can lead to experimentally observable effects , such as positronium oscillation into mirror positronium @xcite , and can also provide an interesting portal for the direct detection of mirror dark matter consisting dominantly of mirror helium and hydrogen and a smaller fraction of heavier mirror nuclei like carbon , oxygen etc . @xcite .",
    "in addition , ordinary and mirror particles can also share some hypothetical forces , interacting e.g. with gauge bosons of common family symmetry @xcite or common @xmath6 symmetry @xcite .",
    "the lepton and baryon number violating interactions between om and mm are of specific interest since they could lead to the co - genesis of baryon asymmetries in both sectors and shed the light on the near coincidence of the baryon and dark matter fractions in the universe @xcite . such interactions , at low energies , would induce lepton or baryon number violating effects such as the ordinary ( active ) neutrino oscillations into mirror ( sterile ) neutrinos @xcite and neutron oscillations into mirror neutrons @xcite , resembling and perhaps related to the more familiar phenomenon of neutron ",
    "antineutron oscillation @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting for us is the effect of neutron to mirror neutron transformation ( @xmath7 ) first theoretically considered in @xcite .",
    "it was noticed in this paper that a @xmath7 oscillation time larger than @xmath8  s can not be excluded by either by the existing at that time experimental data or by cosmological and astrophysical bounds .",
    "the reason why such a fast oscillation ( in fact , faster than the neutron decay ) , which leads to the violation of baryon ( neutron ) number could be unnoticed in experiments is the presence of the earth magnetic field , which was never compensated in the experiments measuring the neutron lifetime .",
    "in fact , in the absence of matter and with a compensated magnetic field half of the neutrons created in experiments would have to disappear within seconds .",
    "however , it was recognized later that a mirror magnetic field @xmath9 , as a natural component of the mm model , might be present but unnoticed in terrestrial experiments , possibly being of galactic origin or due to the accumulation of mm inside the earth @xcite . in particular , the photon ",
    "mirror photon kinetic mixing @xcite could induce large galactic magnetic fields , both ordinary and mirror , via the electron drag mechanism @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the same interaction portal could lead to the accumulation of some small amount of mirror matter in the earth , which could be sufficient for the induction of a mirror magnetic field up to few gauss via the mirror electron drag due to the rotation of the earth , via the mechanism of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this way",
    ", the mirror magnetic field at the earth might have a magnitude of the same order as the earth s own magnetic field .",
    "in addition , its magnitude and orientation relative to ordinary magnetic field can be arbitrary and might also be variable in time @xcite .",
    "the idea of a possible neutron to mirror neutron transformation @xcite and following paper discussing experimental sensitivities for its search @xcite has stimulated several experimental searches @xcite , the results of which were adopted by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "these experiments were performed with ultra - cold neutrons ( ucn ) , where the effect of @xmath7 transformation could lead to the unaccounted disappearance of the neutrons stored in the ucn trap . in the presence of earth magnetic field",
    "@xmath10 , the neutron with its magnetic moment @xmath11 will change its energy level by @xmath12 , while the mirror neutron will not interact with ordinary magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the zeeman split of the energy levels would suppress the @xmath7 transformation .",
    "the first experiments were thought to require shielding of the earth s magnetic field , due to their assumption that no mirror magnetic field could exist at the earth . in this way , under the hypothesis that the mirror magnetic field at the earth is vanishing , the limit @xmath13 s was obtained at 90 @xmath14 c.l . @xcite .    in the later experiments",
    "the existence of a non - zero mirror magnetic field @xmath15 was admitted . in this case , the detection of a disappearance signal would require the tuning of the ordinary laboratory magnetic field @xmath16 and would have a resonance character in the transformation probability if the magnitude of the field @xmath10 were the same as that of the mirror field @xmath9 .",
    "additionally , the transformation effect would be enhanced when the directions of both fields would be aligned and would be minimal when directions of @xmath16 and @xmath15 were opposite .",
    "the probability of @xmath7 transformation in the absence of any fields can be described , as for any two - level system , by the proper oscillation time @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ev  @xcite is a small mass mixing @xmath19 . in the presence of two different magnetic fields",
    "@xmath16 and @xmath15 , time evolution of the probability of @xmath7 transformation was described in  @xcite . since the magnetic moment of neutron ( or mirror neutron ) @xmath20 ev / g , the energy split in milli - gauss magnetic fields @xmath21 and the probability of @xmath22 transition after free flight time @xmath23 can be simplified  @xcite to @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the angle between the magnetic field vectors @xmath26 and @xmath27 and @xmath28}{2\\tau^2(\\omega-\\omega')^2 } + \\frac{\\sin^2[(\\omega+\\omega')t]}{2\\tau^2(\\omega+\\omega')^2 } \\nonumber \\\\ \\\\",
    "\\mathcal{d}_b(t ) = \\frac{\\sin^2[(\\omega-\\omega')t]}{2\\tau^2(\\omega-\\omega')^2 } - \\frac{\\sin^2[(\\omega+\\omega')t]}{2\\tau^2(\\omega+\\omega')^2 } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath11 is the magnetic moment of the neutron and mirror neutron , assumed to be identical  @xcite .",
    "we see that both terms in equation ( 1 ) have a resonance behavior part when the magnitude of the magnetic field @xmath10 is close to the unknown magnitude of mirror magnetic field @xmath9 .",
    "resonance occurs even if the directions of the @xmath16 and @xmath15 vectors do not coincide , but the probability is maximum when @xmath31 and minimum when @xmath32 .    as was mentioned above , all previously published experiments looking for the disappearance of @xmath7 were performed with ultra - cold neutron ( ucn ) vacuum traps .",
    "a relatively small number of ucn were stored in the traps by reflections off the walls coated by material with a high nuclear fermi - potential .",
    "the typical velocity of ucn was a few m / s and the time between collisions was typically around 0.1 s. a controlled , intentionally - uniform magnetic field was applied to the ucn volume and was varied during the experiments .",
    "neutrons that transformed to the mirror state would have become sterile to interactions with om nuclei and would have escaped the trap , thus leading to an increase of the disappearance rate .    in the experiment @xcite , the @xmath7 effect was sought for by studying the variation of the storage time of ucn in the trap with reflecting walls by switching on and off the external magnetic field @xmath10 . in `` off '' mode , the magnetic field in the trap was close to zero ( the earth magnetic field was compensated down to @xmath33 100 nt ) .",
    "no disappearance signal was found corresponding to the oscillation time limit @xmath34 103 s ( 95@xmath14cl ) .    in a more sophisticated ucn experiment @xcite under similar magnetic field @xmath10 suppression , this limit ( assuming no mirror magnetic field ) was improved to an oscillation time of @xmath35 s ( at 90@xmath14cl ) .",
    "these limits , however , are not valid if one assumes that the mirror magnetic fields can be present at the earth .",
    "the experimental data of the latter experiment @xcite were made available to and re - analyzed by one of the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite with a more advanced theoretical oscillation description from @xcite .",
    "additionally , some data runs corresponding to unstable reactor flux conditions , as indicated by the system of two monitoring counters , were excluded .",
    "the neutron storage time in the trap was measured multiple times with variation of the laboratory magnetic field that was regularly alternated in the vertical direction with magnitude @xmath36 . from these data",
    "the asymmetry parameter for up and down variation of the direction of the magnetic field was calculated and the result has shown a peculiar anomaly with statistical @xmath37 deviation from the expected zero asymmetry for non - polarized neutrons in the be - coated trap . in the absence of consistent alternative interpretations , the asymmetry could be explained as an effect of the variation of the angle between @xmath16 and unknown @xmath15 resulting in a different degree of suppression of the @xmath7 transformation probability .",
    "the model @xcite would describe the observed asymmetry by the following parameters : the oscillation time on the order of @xmath38  s and the magnitude of the mirror magnetic field @xmath39  @xmath11 t .",
    "these interpretational parameters , however , should be considered as rather approximate for several reasons .",
    "first , the angle between @xmath10 and @xmath9 remains unknown ; and second , the effect of magnetic field @xmath10 non - uniformity was not accounted for .    in still another experiment @xcite",
    ", an attempt was made to scan the magnitude of the vertical magnetic field in the range 0 to @xmath40 12.5 @xmath11 t at several values of @xmath10 with increments of 2.5 @xmath11 t .",
    "the analysis here had a statistically insignificant indication of the transformation effect with oscillation time 21.9 s ( other fit parameters were @xmath41 t and the angle between vertical up @xmath10 and @xmath9 @xmath42 degree ) .",
    "the data of this experiment also excluded with 95@xmath43 the oscillation time @xmath44 within the range of studied magnitudes of field @xmath10 .",
    "a drawback of this experiment was the rather large incremental step in the variation of the magnitude of magnetic field @xmath10 .",
    "this step was more than two times wider than the width of the resonance in @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the results of all these experiments were controversial .",
    "however , they do not exclude unambiguously the possible existence of the effect in the range of oscillation time @xmath46 10 s for a mirror magnetic field with a magnitude similar to or lower than that of the earth magnetic field .",
    "the common difficulty in the ucn trap experiments is that the measured small absorption coefficient of the reflecting walls of the trap is not reproduced by the theoretical calculations  @xcite , leaving room for the asymmetry anomaly explanation by some other still unidentified phenomena , different than the transformation to a mirror state .",
    "thus , the test of the @xmath7 hypothesis require different technique than ucn traps , where multiple collisions of neutrons with @xmath47 walls of the trap would be excluded .",
    "in demonstrating the new method we will follow papers  @xcite with equations ( 1 ) - ( 2 ) . in paper  @xcite the @xmath48 oscillation effect in the presence of two vector magnetic fields @xmath16 and @xmath15 was exactly solved in the schrdinger equation with a @xmath49 hamiltonian describing both the neutron and mirror neutron polarizations and the mixing between the neutron and mirror neutron components .",
    "the direction of the @xmath15 field is not known a priori , however , the resonance behavior of the @xmath7 transformation still appears when the directions of both fields do not coincide .",
    "thus , the unique characteristic feature of the @xmath7 transformation search will be the observation of a resonance behavior in the counting rate when scanning versus the magnitude of the laboratory field @xmath10 .",
    "at least two opposite directions of the vector @xmath16 should be chosen for the magnitude scan to have sensitivity in the whole range of unknown @xmath50 .",
    "the idea of the observation of a regeneration transformation is well known , e.g. see @xcite . with a cold neutron",
    "beam the regeneration search will attempt to observe the effect of the appearance of neutrons from the mirror state .",
    "a beam of slow neutrons would propagate in vacuum through the path where a uniform magnetic field @xmath16 can be tuned in three components .",
    "let us assume that the direction of magnetic field @xmath10 can be fixed in 3d space , e.g. along the down - up direction and magnitude of field @xmath10 will be varied in steps from @xmath51 to @xmath52 .",
    "the probability of disappearance in the resonance is proportional to the square of the neutron time of flight @xmath53 through the vacuum region where magnetic field is tuned to the resonance : @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , a low neutron velocity and a large flight distance will enhance the probability .",
    "thick absorbing material at the end of the free flight path should remove all neutrons from the initial beam , leaving generated mirror neutrons propagating through the absorber wall as a beam of non - interacting sterile neutrons . behind the beam - stop absorber",
    "there is a second flight path vacuum tube in which identical magnetic field conditions are reproduced . in the second flight path ,",
    "mirror neutrons with similar probability @xmath55 are transformed back to ordinary neutrons that are detected at the end of the flight path by a @xmath56 detector .",
    "this detector , when properly shielded for minimum background , should count no neutrons from the initial beam due to the thick upstream absorber but only the neutrons regenerated from the mirror state in the second tube .",
    "the probability of reappearance of regenerated neutrons in the high - efficiency detector in the resonance condition @xmath57 should be @xmath58 if the field @xmath16 field is uniform along the flight path .    to demonstrate the sensitivity of such a method",
    ", we consider a rather generic configuration of an experiment that could be implemented at many reactors or spallation sources of neutrons where intense cold neutron beams are available ( figure 1 ) .",
    "we assume that two down - the - line flight paths , each 15-m long vacuum tubes , made of non - magnetic aluminum 6061-t6 alloy , can be used inside which the magnetic field will be controlled .",
    "an effective neutron absorber can be placed between the first and second tube , and a high - efficiency detector of slow neutrons with appropriate shielding can be placed at the end of the second tube .",
    "figure 1 also shows a typical collimator defining the divergence of the beam and two additional he-3 counters : one with efficiency @xmath46 1% upstream of the first flight tube serving as the beam intensity monitor and another one with 100% efficiency in front of the beam - stop for a disappearance measurement .    as an example of cold neutron beam we are using the parameters of one of the neutron beams at the spallation neutron source ( sns ) @xcite at oak ridge national laboratory .",
    "the sns , being the latest in a series of well - characterized modern operating sources , is a suitable candidate for such a conceptual illustration .",
    "the sns produces neutrons via the bombardment of high - energy protons into a heavy metal ( liquid mercury ) target .",
    "the proton beam is pulsed at 60hz , allowing exploitation of the time structure to resolve thermal neutron energies to @xmath11ev resolution . while this capability is useful for many neutron scattering applications at sns , @xmath59 search experiment would not immediately benefit from this time structure .",
    "the high - brilliance of the cryogenic super - critical @xmath60 moderator system provides a very intense source of sub - thermal neutrons  @xcite .        using the mcstas neutron simulation package  @xcite we optimized the layout geometry of the hypothetical regeneration search experiment at one of the typical sns beams .",
    "the simulation included the transport with gravity of the neutron beam from the cold moderator through a simple 12.5-m long collimator with opening aperture @xmath61 @xmath62 providing beam divergence of @xmath63 mrad .",
    "the simulated normalized cold neutron beam velocity spectrum is shown in figure 2 .",
    "cold beam flux can be described by the maxwellian distribution function with equivalent temperature @xmath64k .",
    "the integrated neutron intensity was found to be @xmath65 neutrons / sec / mw in the velocity range 200 - 2000 m / s ( wavelength @xmath66 angstroms ) .",
    "slow neutrons in the spectrum are more valuable for the @xmath7 observation since they would spend more time in the flight tube ; however , the effect of gravity causes a lower limit on this velocity .",
    "we assumed ( see figure 1 ) a @xmath67 detector ( a ) operating in dc integration mode with efficiency 1% upstream of the first flight tube , as the most common equipment for monitoring the intensity of cold beams . with beam intensity @xmath68",
    "n / s , this detector ( a ) will measure the current integrated over 1 second to be proportional to @xmath69 .",
    "after the first flight tube , the detector ( b ) with @xmath70 efficiency can be used .",
    "this is a @xmath67 dc - integrating counter measuring the full beam intensity .",
    "measurements of the integrated currents ratio in ( a ) and ( b ) counters as @xmath71 could detect the @xmath7 `` disappearance '' signal at the end of the first flight tube for the resonance value of magnetic field @xmath10 . beyond the statistical accuracy of the monitoring with counter ( a ) , the stability of the `` counters '' operation and the beam intensity fluctuations might set additional limits on the sensitivity of disappearance detection .    at the end of second flight tube ,",
    "@xmath67 the counter ( c ) , operating in the proportional pulsed mode , is used for counting regenerated neutrons with an efficiency close to 100 % .",
    "this counter should be well shielded to provide the lowest background counting rate possible .",
    "assuming that counter ( c ) will have a transversal size @xmath72  @xmath62 we found from the comparison with similar existing devices that the achievable background rate can be lower than @xmath73 counts / sec .",
    "we will assume this rate for further estimates .",
    "we assume that the magnetic field inside the flight tubes can be generated with 3-dimensional coils positioned outside the non - magnetic tube .",
    "these coils will compensate the local , uniform earth magnetic field and create controlled 3-d magnetic field inside the flight tube .",
    "if the local , environmental magnetic field will be non - uniform , additional coils can be installed to compensate for these local effects .",
    "alternatively , an outer layer of @xmath11-metal shielding can be installed around the field - shaping coils and the vacuum tubes .",
    "using active feedback of the currents and reference magnetic fields , we assume that the magnetic field can be controlled in any direction with magnitude from 0 to 200 milli - gauss ( 20  @xmath11 t ) and with uniformity better than 2 milli - gauss . the design and control of the magnetic field will probably be the most challenging but doable technical problem in the considered experiment .",
    "the effects of magnetic field fluctuations can lead to some deviation from the quasi - free condition as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite for neutron ",
    "antineutron oscillation @xcite ; however , these effects can be kept under control .    to illustrate the capability of the regeneration method",
    ", we performed a simulation of a measurement made with the layout shown in figure 1 , using beam parameters obtained from the sns beam simulations .",
    "since the magnitude of mirror magnetic field @xmath9 is unknown , we assumed that a scan will be made with the @xmath10 field magnitude varying e.g. in 100 steps from 0 to 200 mg with a step - size of 2 mg .",
    "since the direction of @xmath9 field is also unknown , we anticipate that this 100-point scan should be repeated for the opposite direction of vector @xmath16 . according to above formulas ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , the transformation probability in the resonance @xmath74 , neglecting non - resonance term in ( 2 ) , will be    @xmath75    assuming that the oscillation time is fixed , the probability is maximum for @xmath76 , reduces to @xmath77 at @xmath78 , and further becames zero at @xmath79 according to ( 3 ) .",
    "thus , making two 100-point scans with two opposite directions of @xmath16 will cover the possible variation of the disappearance probability magnitude by a factor two due to the unknown direction of @xmath15 .",
    "for the regeneration effect at the end of second flight tube , the possible variation of the probability in each of the hemispheres around the two directions of @xmath16 will be a factor 4 .    for the regeneration simulation , we have chosen following parameters : the positive direction of vector @xmath16 is vertical up ; @xmath80 mg , @xmath81 ; the background rate is 0.1 @xmath82 .",
    "we assumed that 200 counting runs will be made , each run with the fixed magnitude of @xmath10 ranging from @xmath83 mg to @xmath84 mg in steps of @xmath85 mg .",
    "the duration of each run will be 3600 seconds .",
    "thus , the whole measurement should take @xmath86 days of beam time . to correct for possible beam instabilities , the counting rate of the regeneration counter ( c )",
    "can be normalized to the counting rate of the beam monitor ( a ) .",
    "the simulated regeneration counting rate is shown in figure 3 for @xmath87 s. black points represent counts in every run , and the continuous curve is the sum of the simulated effect and assumed background .",
    "the counts in the peak of the resonance correspond to a signal of more than 12@xmath88 significance .",
    "the resonance in the opposite hemisphere of @xmath16 is statistically insignificant .    since scans with two directions",

    "disappearance effect that can be measured at the same time during the hypothetical 10-day magnetic field scan and will provide an independent measurement of the @xmath7 effect .",
    "the total beam intensity will need to be measured with total absorption counter ( b ) installed at the end of the first flight tube upstream of the beam stop .",
    "due to the high beam intensity , this @xmath67 counter should operate in current - integrating mode . since the disappearance effect is a small fraction @xmath95 of the beam intensity the stability of the neutron flux in the beam needs to be monitored by an independent counter .",
    "we assumed that a current - integrating @xmath67 counter ( a ) with 1% efficiency will be installed upstream the first flight tube .",
    "statistical fluctuations of the beam intensity monitoring in this counter will be the main contribution to the uncertainty in the measurement of the disappearance effect .",
    "thus , with 1% monitoring efficiency , the sensitivity of detection of @xmath7 disappearance will be worse than in the regeneration measurement .",
    "however , statistics of 1% beam monitoring by counter ( a ) will practically not contribute to the accuracy of measurement of regeneration effect .",
    "the simulated measurement of disappearance effect for the same 10-day scan with the same parameters as above but with an oscillation time of @xmath96 s is shown in figure 4 .",
    "the larger disappearance peak in this figure at the resonance value has a significance of more than @xmath97 where we are assuming the contribution of only statistical factors .",
    "it is noted that the width of the disappearance resonance is wider than that of the regeneration curve , and the ratio of the heights of @xmath92 and @xmath93 peaks is also higher in accordance with equations ( 1)-(3 ) .    to improve the monitoring statistics it is possible to think of an alternative way to monitor the source , such as when the total absorption counter would view the cold source through a different beamline opening . in this case",
    "the statistical sensitivity of the disappearance measurement might be essentially better than in the regeneration measurement .",
    "if both the disappearance and regeneration measurements are implemented simultaneously , as in our hypothetical case , they can be analyzed together and the combined sensitivity might be improved . with 1% efficiency monitoring , the disappearance method alone can provide statistically 95% cl exclusion limit for @xmath98 s ; with 100% monitor efficiency , 95% cl exclusion limit can be @xmath99 s. an increase of the experiment measurement time by a factor @xmath100 will improve exclusion limits for both disappearance and regeneration by approximately @xmath101 s.     oscillation time @xmath96s . ]",

    "alternative to exclusion , an observation of the resonance peak in disappearance would demonstrate a new effect of @xmath7 transformation .",
    "additionally , the resonance peak observed in regeneration will establish the existence of a beam of sterile neutrons that can be available for further experiments .",

    "other sources of cold neutrons and the improved beam line design potentially can provide larger sensitivities .",
    "in particular , the european spallation source ( ess ) under construction at lund @xcite with large beam port envisaged in the project for the nnbar experiment , due to higher cold neutron flux and larger length of the neutron flight path can provide sensitivity for an oscillation time of more than 50 seconds . in this way",

    "<S> the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that if the transformation of neutron to mirror neutron exists with an oscillation time of the order of ten seconds , it can be detected in a rather simple disappearance and/or regeneration type experiment with an intense beam of cold neutrons . in the presence of a conjectural mirror magnetic field of unknown magnitude and direction </S>",
    "<S> , the resonance transformation conditions can be found by scanning the magnitude of the ordinary magnetic field in the range e.g. @xmath0 t . </S>",
    "<S> magnetic field is assumed to be uniform along the path of the neutron beam . </S>",
    "<S> if the transformation effect exists within this range , the direction and possible time variation of the mirror magnetic field can be determined with additional dedicated measurements .    </S>",
