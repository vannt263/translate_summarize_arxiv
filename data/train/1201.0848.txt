    "inspired by the pioneer achievements make by yvon  @xcite , novilov  @xcite , chambadal  @xcite , curzon and ahlborn  @xcite , the issue of efficiency at the maximum power ( emp ) has drawn much attention from scientists with the desire to design engines that can provide sufficient power with higher efficiency . the emerging theoretical advances in this field",
    "@xcite improve our understanding to the issue of emp for heat engines and irreversible thermodynamics .",
    "recently , esposito _ et al .",
    "_ investigated the carnot - like engines working in the low - dissipation region @xcite and obtained the lower bound @xmath5 and the upper bound @xmath6 of emp for this kind of engines , where @xmath3 is the carnot efficiency .",
    "in addition , gaveau and his coworkers proposed a concept of sustainable efficiency and proved that it has the upper bound @xmath7 , based on which they also obtained the upper bound @xmath8 for the efficiency of carnot - like engines at maximum power @xcite .",
    "seifert argued that the upper bound @xmath7 for the sustainable efficiency holds only in the linear nonequilibrium region @xcite .",
    "@xcite provided a nice example of single level quantum dot where the upper bound can vary from @xmath9 to @xmath10 with increasing the thermodynamic force , which to some extent supports seifert s argument .",
    "therefore the upper bound @xmath1 might not hold for emp of carnot - like heat engines arbitrarily far from equilibrium . in recent work",
    ", we classified irreversible carnot - like heat engines into three types ( linear , sublinear and superlinear ) , and derived the corresponding emp to be bounded between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath1 , respectively @xcite .",
    "particularly , we found that the emp of sublinear irreversible heat engines could reach the carnot efficiency @xcite .",
    "it is necessary to introduce the concept of effective temperature of working substance for most of models mentioned above .",
    "however , the definition of effective temperature is debatable in some cases .",
    "et al . _ started from the time - dependent behavior of the irreversible entropy production in the  isothermal \" ( the quote marks on the word  isothermal \" merely indicate the working substance in contact with a reservoir at a constant temperature ) process without introducing the effective temperature of working substance @xcite , which inspired us that the upper and lower bounds of emp might be straightly derived from the relation between the irreversible entropy production in the  isothermal \" process and the time for completing that process . here",
    ", we classify the carnot - like engines into three types ( normal- , sub- and super - dissipative ) according to the relations between the minimum irreversible entropy production in the finite - time ",
    "isothermal \" processes and the time for completing those processes .",
    "the emps of normal- , sub- and super - dissipative carnot - like heat engines are proved to be bounded between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we consider a heat engine perform the following carnot - like cycle which consists of four processes .    _",
    " isothermal \" expansion . _",
    "the working substance of heat engine is in contact with a hot reservoir at temperature @xmath11 and the constraint on the system is loosened according to some external controlled parameter @xmath12 during the time interval @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the time variable .",
    "a certain amount of heat @xmath15 is absorbed from the hot reservoir .",
    "then the variation of entropy of working substance can be expressed as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the irreversible entropy production in this finite time process . because @xmath18 is a state function , its value can be calculated from the variation of entropy in the real isothermal expansion process constituting an ideal carnot cycle .",
    "_ adiabatic expansion . _",
    "the adiabatic expansion is idealized as the working substance suddenly decouples from the hot reservoir and then comes into contact with the cold reservoir instantly at time @xmath19 . during this transition ,",
    "the constraint on the system is loosened further .",
    "there is no heat exchange and entropy production in this process .    _",
    " isothermal \" compression . _",
    "the working substance is in contact with a cold reservoir at temperature @xmath20 and the constraint on the system is enhanced according to the external controlled parameter @xmath21 during the time interval @xmath22 .",
    "a certain amount of heat @xmath23 is released to the cold reservoir .",
    "the variation of entropy of working substance in this process can be expressed as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the irreversible entropy production . because @xmath26 is also a state function , its value can be calculated from the variation of entropy in the real isothermal compression process constituting the ideal carnot cycle .    _ adiabatic compression . _",
    "similar to the adiabatic expansion , the working substance suddenly decouples from the cold reservoir and then comes into contact with the hot reservoir instantaneously at time @xmath27 .",
    "there is no heat exchange and entropy production in this process .",
    "having undergone this carnot - like cycle , the system comes back to its initial state again .",
    "thus there are no net energy change and variation of entropy in the whole cycle .",
    "then we have @xmath28 and and the net work output @xmath29 .",
    "the power can be expressed as @xmath30 according to the equation above , maximizing the power means minimizing the irreversible entropy production with respect to the protocols @xmath12 and @xmath12 for given time intervals @xmath31 and @xmath32 first , then eq .   can be transformed into @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 represent @xmath36 and @xmath36 for given time intervals @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively . in fact , they reflect to what extent the engines depart from equilibrium for given time intervals @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "intuitionally , the irreversible entropy production decreases as the increase of time for completing the  isothermal \" processes , thus @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be expressed as monotonely increasing function with respect to @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "if we introduce a transformation of variables @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , the minimum irreversible entropy production in each  isothermal",
    "\" process can be expressed as @xmath41 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "this transformation has also been extended to investigate the optimizations of low - dissipation refrigerators  @xcite and irreversible carnot - like engines with internally dissipative friction  @xcite .",
    "we can defined three kinds of typical characteristics according to the behavior of @xmath42 , which is similar to the analysis in our previous work @xcite .",
    "the first one is called normal dissipative type which is represented by the straight line in fig .  1 .",
    "this type of carnot - like engines is also called the low - dissipation engines by esposito _ et al .",
    "the second one is called sub - dissipative type which is represented by the convex curve in fig.1 .",
    "the third one is called super - dissipative type which is represented by the concave curve in fig.1 .",
    "the behavior of three kinds of characteristics can be mathematically expressed as @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 represent @xmath34(or @xmath35 ) , @xmath47(or @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 ( or @xmath50 ) , respectively .",
    "the heat absorbed or released by the engines can be expressed as @xmath51 and @xmath52 given the two equations above , we can obtain the efficiency @xmath53 and the power @xmath54x_1x_3}{(x_1+x_3)}. \\label{powerr}\\ ] ]    maximizing the power with respect to @xmath47 and @xmath48 , we can obtain @xmath55x_3=t_1x_1(x_1+x_3)l'_1,\\ ] ] and @xmath56x_1=t_3x_3(x_1+x_3)l'_3.\\ ] ] dividing eqs .   and , we derive @xmath57 adding eqs .   and with the consideration of eq .",
    ", we find that the emp satisfies @xmath58 which is the key equation in our paper .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the bounds of emp for three types of carnot - like dissipative engines in terms of the characteristics of the relation between the minimum entropy production in each ",
    "isothermal \" processes and the time for completing those processes .      the minimum entropy production in the  isothermal \" processes and the time for completing those processes of normal dissipative engines satisfy @xmath59 and @xmath60 which imply @xmath61 .",
    "considering @xmath62 , we derive @xmath63 . considering eq .",
    ", we can derive the emp of normal - dissipative engines to be bounded between @xmath5 and @xmath6 which are the same as the bounds obtained by esposito and his coworkers @xcite .",
    "a major difference is that here we derive the bounds directly from eq .   without calculating the explicit expression of emp .",
    "particularly , if we consider eqs .   and for the symmetric normal - dissipation case @xmath64 , it is not difficult for us to recover the ca efficiency @xmath65 in this special case .",
    "in addition , we should point out that the time for competing the two isothermal processes satisfied the relation that @xmath66 in this symmetric normal - dissipation case .",
    "the sub - dissipative engines satisfy @xmath67 and @xmath68 which imply @xmath69 . given that @xmath70 , then we finally derive the lower bound of emp to be @xmath71 for the sub - dissipative engines from eq .  .",
    "the above inequalities give no confinement on the upper bound , thus we may take @xmath72 as a reasonable estimate .",
    "the super - dissipative engines satisfy @xmath73 and @xmath74 which imply @xmath75 . given that @xmath76 , then we finally derive the upper bound of emp to be @xmath77 for the super - dissipative engines .",
    "the above inequalities give no confinement on the lower bound , thus we may take @xmath78 as a conservative estimate .      for examples ,",
    "we consider the relation of power - law profile , @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are given parameters .",
    "it is easy to see that a heat engine is of normal- , sub- or super - dissipative type if @xmath82 , @xmath83 or @xmath84 , respectively . substituting this relation into eqs .   and",
    ", we can explicitly derive the expression of emp as @xmath85}},\\ ] ] from which we can find @xmath86 for normal - dissipative engines , @xmath82 , eq .",
    "implies that @xmath87 . for sub - dissipative engines , @xmath83 , eq .",
    "implies that @xmath88 where the upper bound @xmath3 can be reached for sufficiently large @xmath89 while the lower bound can be reached for @xmath90 . for super - dissipative engines , @xmath84 , eq .",
    "implies that @xmath91 where the lower bound @xmath4 can be reached for small enough @xmath89 while the upper bound can be reached for @xmath92 .",
    "the maximum power can also be calculated with consideration of the power - law profile , @xmath93 . from eq .",
    "we can obtain that the inverse of time for completing the two processes satisfied @xmath94 . substituting this relation into eq .   to solve @xmath47 and @xmath48 , then considering eq .",
    ", we derive the maximum power output @xmath95^{1 + 1/n}.\\ ] ] when @xmath82 and @xmath96 , the above equation reduces to @xmath97 which is in agreement with the universal behavior [ @xmath98 of maximum power obtained by curzon and ahlborn  @xcite . on the other hand , for large",
    "@xmath89 , equation degenerates into @xmath99 , which implies that the maximum power of sub - dissipative engines is still nonvanishing although its emp can approach to the carnot efficiency .",
    "the heat engines are classified into three dissipative types according to characteristics of the relations between the minimum irreversible entropy production in the  isothermal \" processes and the time for completing those processes .",
    "the bounds of emp for three types of dissipative carnot - like engines can be summarized as @xmath100 which display certain universality for each types of dissipative carnot - like engines .",
    "it is interesting that the bounds of emps for normal- , sub- and super - dissipative carnot - like engines correspond respectively to those for linear , sub- and super - linear irreversible carnot - like engines discussed in our previous work @xcite .",
    "however , a simple consideration implies that these two kinds of classifications are different from each other @xcite .",
    "it is still a challenge to understand why they share the same bounds .",
    "another major challenge is the entropy production in the adiabatic process which is assumed to be vanishing in most of researches  @xcite .",
    "this is indeed true for some micro - systems such as the stochastic heat engines proposed by schmiedl and seifert @xcite .",
    "however , it might not be true for the macroscopic heat engines and quantum heat engines .",
    "thus the time for complete two adiabatic transitions should not be neglected .",
    "recently , wang and he argued that the entropy production might be also inversely proportional to the time for completing the adiabatic process @xcite .",
    "it is necessary for us to investigate this issue carefully in the further work .",
