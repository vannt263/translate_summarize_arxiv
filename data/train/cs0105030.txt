    "language technology and the linguistic sciences are confronted with a vast array of _ language resources _ , richly structured , large and diverse .",
    "multiple _ communities _ depend on language resources , including linguists , engineers , teachers and actual speakers . many individuals and institutions",
    "provide key pieces of the infrastructure , including archivists , software developers , and publishers .",
    "today we have unprecedented opportunities to _ connect _ these communities to the language resources they need .",
    "first , inexpensive mass storage technology permits large resources to be stored in digital form , while the extensible markup language ( xml ) and unicode provide flexible ways to represent structured data and ensure its long - term survival .",
    "second , digital publication  both on and off the world wide web  is the most practical and efficient means of sharing language resources . finally , a standard resource description model , the dublin core metadata set , together with an interchange method provided by the open archives initiative ( oai ) , make it possible to construct a union catalog over multiple repositories and archives .    in december 2000 , an nsf - funded workshop on web - based language documentation and description , held in philadelphia , brought together a group of nearly 100 language software developers , linguists , and archivists who are responsible for creating language resources in north america , south america , europe , africa , the middle east , asia and australia http://www.ldc.upenn.edu / exploration / expl2000/. the outcome of the workshop was the founding of the open language archives community ( olac ) , an application of the oai to digital archives of language resources , with the following purpose :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ olac , the open language archives community , is an international partnership of institutions and individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by : ( i )  developing consensus on best current practice for the digital archiving of language resources , and ( ii )  developing a network of interoperating repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    this paper will describe the leading ideas that motivate olac , before focussing on the metadata set and the controlled vocabularies which implement part ( ii ) of olac s statement of purpose .",
    "metadata elements of special interest to the language resources community include such things as language identification and language resource type .",
    "the corresponding controlled vocabularies ensure consistent description .",
    "for example , french language resources are specified using an official rfc-3066 designation @xcite , instead of multiple distinct text strings like `` french '' , `` francais '' and `` franais '' . a separate controlled vocabulary exists for resource type , and has items such as and . services for end - users can map controlled vocabularies onto convenient terminology for any target language .",
    "( a live demonstration accompanies this presentation . )",
    "we can observe that the individuals who use and create language resources are looking for three things : data , tools , and advice . by data we mean any information that documents or describes a language , such as a published monograph , a computer data file , or even a shoebox full of hand - written index cards .",
    "the information could range in content from unanalyzed sound recordings to fully transcribed and annotated texts to a complete descriptive grammar . by tools",
    "we mean computational resources that facilitate creating , viewing , querying , or otherwise using language data .",
    "tools include not just software programs , but also the digital resources that the programs depend on , such as fonts , stylesheets , and document type definitions . by advice",
    "we mean any information about what data sources are reliable , what tools are appropriate in a given situation , what practices to follow when creating new data , and so forth . in the context of olac , the term _ language resource _ is broadly construed to include all three of these : data , tools and advice .",
    "unfortunately , today s user does not have ready access to the resources that are needed .",
    "figure  [ fig : vision2 ] offers a diagrammatic view of the reality . some archives ( e.g. archive 1 ) do have a site on the internet which the user is able to find , so the resources of that archive are accessible .",
    "other archives ( e.g. archive 2 ) are on the internet , so the user could access them in theory , but the user has no idea they exist so they are not accessible in practice . still other archives ( e.g. archive 3 ) are not even on the internet . and there are potentially hundreds of archives ( e.g. archive @xmath0 ) that the user needs to know about .",
    "tools and advice are out there as well , but are at many different sites .",
    "there are many other problems inherent in the current situation .",
    "for instance , the user may not be able to find all the existing data about the language of interest because different sites have called it by different names ( low _ recall _ ) .",
    "the user may be swamped with irrelevant resources because search terms have important meanings in other domains ( low _ precision _ ) .",
    "the user may not be able to use an accessible data file for lack of being able to match it with the right tools .",
    "the user may locate advice that seems relevant but have no basis for judging its merits .        as the internet grows and web - indexing technologies improve one might hope that a general - purpose search engine should be sufficient to bridge the gap between people and the resources they need , but this is a vain hope .",
    "the first reason is that many language resources , such as audio files and software , are not text - based .",
    "the second reason concerns language identification , the single most important property for describing language resources .",
    "if a language has a canonical name which is distinctive as a character string , then the user has a chance of finding any online resources with a search engine .",
    "however , the language may have multiple names , possibly due to the vagaries of romanization , such as a language known variously as fadicca , fadicha , fedija , fadija , fiadidja , fiyadikkya , and fedicca ( giving low recall ) .",
    "the language name may collide with a word which has other interpretations that are vastly more frequent , e.g.  the language names mango and santa cruz ( giving low precision ) .",
    "the third reason why general - purpose search engines are inadequate is the simple fact that much of the material is not , and will not , be documented in free prose on the web . either people will build systematic catalogues of their resources , or they wo nt do it at all . of course , one can always export a back - end database as html and let the search engines index the materials . indeed",
    ", encouraging people to document resources and make them accessible to search engines is part of our vision .",
    "however , despite the power of web search engines , there remain many instances where people still prefer to use more formal databases to house their data .",
    "this last point bears further consideration .",
    "the challenge is to build a system for `` bringing like things together and differentiating among them '' @xcite . there are two dominant storage and indexing paradigms , one exemplified by traditional databases and one exemplified by the web . in the case of language resources , the metadata is coherent enough to be stored in a formal database , but sufficiently distributed and dynamic that it is impractical to maintain it centrally .",
    "language resources occupy the middle ground between the two paradigms , neither of which will serve adequately . a new framework is required that permits the best of both worlds , namely bottom - up , distributed initiatives , along with consistent , centralized finding aids .",
    "the dublin core ( dc ) and the open archives initiative provide the framework we need to `` bridge the gap . ''",
    "the dublin core metadata initiative began in 1995 to develop conventions for resource discovery on the web .",
    "the dublin core metadata elements represent a broad , interdisciplinary consensus about the core set of elements that are likely to be widely useful to support resource discovery .",
    "the dublin core consists of 15 metadata elements , where each element is optional and repeatable : .",
    "this set can be used to describe resources that exist in digital or traditional formats .    in `` dublin",
    "core qualifiers '' @xcite two kinds of qualifications are allowed : encoding schemes and refinements .",
    "an _ encoding scheme _ specifies a particular controlled vocabulary or notation for expressing the value of an element .",
    "the encoding scheme serves to aid a client system in interpreting the exact meaning of the element content .",
    "refinement _ makes the meaning of the element more specific .",
    "for example , a element can be _ encoded _ using the conventions of rfc 3066 to unambiguously identify the language in which the resource is written ( or spoken ) .",
    "a element can be given a language _ refinement _ to restrict its interpretation to concern the language the resource is about .",
    "the open archives initiative ( oai ) was launched in october 1999 to provide a common framework across electronic preprint archives , and it has since been broadened to include digital repositories of scholarly materials regardless of their type @xcite .        in the oai infrastructure , each participating archive implements a repository  a network accessible server offering public access to archive holdings .",
    "the primary object in an oai - conformant repository is called an _ item _ , having a unique identifier and being associated with one or more metadata records .",
    "each metadata record describes an archive holding , which is any kind of primary resource such as a document , raw data , software , a recording , a physical artifact , a digital surrogate , and so forth .",
    "each metadata record will usually contain a reference to an entry point for the holding , such as a url or a physical location , as shown in figure  [ fig : white - paper1 ] .    to implement the oai infrastructure ,",
    "a participating archive must comply with two standards : the _ oai shared metadata set _ ( dublin core ) , which facilitates interoperability across all repositories participating in the oai , and the _ oai metadata harvesting protocol _ , which allows software services to query a repository using http requests .",
    "oai archives are called `` data providers , '' though they are strictly just _ metadata _ providers .",
    "typically , data providers will also have a submission procedure , together with a long - term storage system , and a mechanism permitting users to obtain materials from the archive . an oai `` service provider '' is a third party that provides end - user services ( such as search functions over union catalogs ) based on metadata harvested from one or more oai data providers .",
    "figure  [ fig : white - paper2 ] illustrates a single service provider accessing three data providers ( using the oai metadata harvesting protocol ) .",
    "end - users only interact with service providers .    over the past decade",
    ", the linguist list has become the primary source of online information for the linguistics community , reaching out to over 13,000 subscribers worldwide , and having four complete mirror sites .",
    "the linguist list will be augmenting its service by hosting the primary service provider for olac , and permitting end - users to browse distributed language resources at a single place .",
    "the oai infrastructure is a new invention ; it has the bottom - up , distributed character of the web , while simultaneously having the efficient , structured nature of a centralized database .",
    "this combination is well - suited to the language resource community , where the available data is growing rapidly and where a large user - base is fairly consistent in how it describes its resource needs .",
    "the primary outcome of the philadelphia workshop was the founding of the open language archives community , and with it the identification of an advisory board , alpha testers and member archives .",
    "details of these groups are available from the olac site .",
    "recall that the oai community is defined by the archives which comply with the oai metadata harvesting protocol and that register with the oai .",
    "any compliant repository can register as an open archive , and the metadata provided by an open archive is open to the public .",
    "oai data providers may support metadata standards in addition to the dublin core .",
    "thus , a specialist community can define a metadata format which is specific to its domain .",
    "service providers , data providers and users that employ this specialized metadata format constitute an oai _",
    "subcommunity_. the workshop participants agreed unanimously that the oai provides a significant piece of the infrastructure needed for the language resources community .    in the same way that olac represents a specialized subcommunity with respect to the entire open archives community , there are specialized subcommunities within the scope of olac .",
    "for instance , the isle meta data initiative is developing a detailed metadata scheme for corpora of recorded speech events and their associated descriptions @xcite .",
    "similarly , the language data centers  the linguistic data consortium ( ldc ) and the european language resources association ( elra )  are using olac metadata as the basis of a joint catalog , and will add elements and vocabularies for their specialized needs ( price , rights , and categories of membership and use ) . for archived language resources that are of this kind , such a metadata scheme would support a richer description .",
    "this specialized subcommunity can implement its own service provider that offers focused searching based on its own rich metadata set . at the same time , the data providers will exposing olac and dublin core versions of the metadata , permitting the resources to be discovered by users of olac and oai service providers .",
    "the oai framework permits archives to interoperate .",
    "oai archives support the dublin core metadata format and metadata harvesting protocol .",
    "olac archives additionally support the olac metadata format .",
    "widespread adoption of these standards will permit language resource archives to be federated and integrated .",
    "first , a collection of archives which support the same metadata format can be federated , in the sense that a virtual meta - archive can collect all the information into a single place , and end - users can query multiple archives simultaneously . to demonstrate this ,",
    "the linguistic data consortium has harvested the catalogs of three language resource archives ( ldc , elra , dfki ) and created a prototype service provider . a search for returns records from all three archives ,",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sp ] @xcite .",
    "second , a collection of archives which support the same metadata format can be integrated , in the sense that relational joins can be performed across different archives .",
    "this permits queries such as : `` find all lexicon tools that understand a format for which hungarian data is available . ''",
    "the olac metadata set extends the dublin core set only to the minimum degree required to express basic properties of language resources which are useful as finding aids .",
    "all fifteen dublin core elements are used in the olac metadata set . in order to suit the specific needs of the language resources community ,",
    "the elements have been qualified following principles articulated in `` dublin core qualifiers '' @xcite and exemplified in @xcite .",
    "this section describes some of the attributes , elements and controlled vocabularies of the olac metadata set . before launching into this discussion",
    ", we first review some xml terminology and explain some aspects of the olac representation which follow directly from our choice of xml .      the extensible markup language ( xml ) is the universal format for structured documents and data on the web .",
    "the key building block of an xml document is the _",
    "element_. an element has a _ name _ , _ attributes _ and _ content_. here is an example of an element with attributes and , and free - text content :    .... < language refine=\"olac \" code=\"x - sil - ban \" >    foreke dschang</language > ....    in general , xml elements may contain other elements , or they may be empty .",
    "xml document type definitions ( dtds ) and xml schemas are grammars that define the structure of a valid xml document , and they limit the arrangement of xml elements in a document .",
    "we believe it is important to use a formal mechanism for validating a metadata record . following the oai , we use xml schemas to specify the olac metadata format .",
    "xml schemas make it possible for element content and attribute values to be constrained according to the element name",
    ". however , xml schemas do not permit element content to be constrained on the basis of the attribute value . accordingly , in implementing qualified dublin core using xml , we are limited to using one encoding scheme ( or controlled vocabulary ) per element .",
    "there are two cases we need to consider here . in the case where all refinements of an element employ the same encoding scheme",
    ", we use the element name as is and add a attribute with a fixed value .",
    "this documents that the particular encoding scheme has been used , and ensures that the element can not be confused with a corresponding unqualified dublin core element ( see the above example ) . in the case where different refinements of an element employ different encoding schemes , then a unique element must be defined .",
    "following @xcite , we define such elements by concatenating the dublin core element name and the refinement name with an intervening dot .",
    "an example is shown below :    .... < format.encoding code=\"iso-8859 - 1\"/ > ....      three attributes  , , and ",
    "are used throughout the metadata set to handle most qualifications to dublin core .",
    "some elements in the olac metadata set use the attribute to identify element refinements .",
    "these qualifiers make the meaning of an element narrower or more specific .",
    "a refined element shares the meaning of the unqualified element , but with a more restricted scope @xcite .    some elements in the olac metadata set use the attribute to hold metadata values that are taken from a specific encoding scheme .",
    "when an element may take this attribute , the attribute value specifies a precise value for the element taken from a controlled vocabulary or formal notation (  [ sec : cv ] ) . in such cases , the element content",
    "may also be used to specify a freeform elaboration of the coded value .    every element in the olac metadata set",
    "may use the attribute .",
    "it specifies the language in which the text in the content of the element is written .",
    "the value for the attribute comes from a controlled vocabulary olac - language . by default",
    ", the attribute has the value `` en '' , for english .",
    "whenever the language of the element content is other than english , the attribute should be used to identify the language . by using multiple instances of the metadata elements tagged for different languages",
    ", data providers may offer their metadata records in multiple languages .",
    "in addition , there is a attribute on the ` < olac > ` element that contains the metadata elements for a given metadata record .",
    "it lists the languages in which the metadata record is designed to be read .",
    "this attribute holds a space - delimited list of language codes . by default",
    ", this attribute has the value `` en '' , for english , indicating that the record is aimed only at english readers .",
    "if an explicit value is given for the attribute , then the record is aimed at readers of all the languages listed .",
    "service providers should use this information in order to offer multilingual views of the metadata .",
    "when a metadata record lists only one alternative language , then all elements are displayed ( regardless of their individual languages ) , unless the user has requested to suppress all records in that language .",
    "when a metadata record has multiple alternative languages , the user should be able to select one and have display of elements in the other languages suppressed .",
    "an element in a language not included in the list of alternatives should always be displayed ( for instance , the vernacular title of a work ) .      in this section",
    "we present a synopsis of the elements of the olac metadata set . for each element , we provide a one sentence definition followed by a brief discussion , systematically borrowing and adapting the definitions provided by the dublin core metadata initiative @xcite . each element is optional and repeatable .",

    "the    vocabulary for refinements to relation is defined in @xcite .",
    ": : :    * information about rights held in and over the resource . *",
    "typically , a    element will contain a rights management statement for the resource ,    or reference a service providing such information .",

    "service providers can exploit this feature to match data with appropriate software tools .      controlled vocabularies are enumerations of legal values for the attribute . in some cases ,",
    "more than one value applies , in which case the corresponding element must be repeated , once for each applicable value . in other cases , no value is applicable ands the corresponding element is simply omitted . in yet other cases , the controlled vocabulary may fail to provide a suitable item , in which case a similar item can be optionally specified and a prose comment included in the element content .",
    "language identification is an important dimension of language resource classification .",
    "however , the character - string representation of language names is problematic for several reasons : different languages ( in different parts of the world ) may have the same name ; the same language may have a different name in each country where it is spoken ; within the same country , the preferred name for a language may change over time ; in the early history of discovering new languages ( before names were standardized ) , different people referred to the same language by different names ; and for languages having non - roman orthographies , the language name may have several possible romanizations .",
    "together , these facts suggest that a standard based on names will not work . instead",
    ", we need a standard based on unique identifiers that do not change , combined with accessible documentation that clarifies the particular speech variety denoted by each identifier .",
    "the information technology community has a standard for language identification , namely , iso 639 @xcite .",
    "part 1 of this standard lists two - letter codes for identifying 160 of the world s major languages ; part 2 of the standard lists three - letter codes for identifying about 400 languages .",
    "iso 639 in turn forms the core of another standard , rfc 3066 ( formerly rfc 1766 ) , which is the standard used for language identification in the xml : lang attribute of xml and in the language element of the dublin core metadata set .",
    "rfc 3066 provides a mechanism for users to register new language identification codes for languages not covered by iso 639 , but very few additional languages have been registered .    unfortunately , the existing standard falls far short of meeting the needs of the language resources community since it fails to account for more than 90% of the world s languages , and it fails to adequately document what languages the codes refer to @xcite .",

    "another dimension of central importance is the linguistic type of a resource .",
