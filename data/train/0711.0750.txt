    "as soon as the evidence of a supermassive black hole in the center of the milky way ( identified with the radio source sgr a * ) became overwhelming , the scientific community started to investigate its ability of acting as a gravitational lens for background stellar sources .",
    "the first work by @xcite considered lensing of sources in the immediate environment of sgr a * and showed that the background sky should appear slightly depleted by a lensing effect .",
    "they suggested the possibility that gravitational lensing could be strong enough to generate an observable secondary image for several stars at a given time .",
    "more precise estimates by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , point out that about 10 stars belonging to the galactic bulge should give rise to secondary images with @xmath7 at a given time .",
    "deep and high resolution images in the near infrared of the galactic center are being obtained by several advanced observatories such as keck , vlt , and gemini north .",
    "the progress registered by these observations encourages to search for signatures of lensing effects by sgr a*. for example , identifying the two images of a background source @xcite , or measuring the astrometric shift of the background stars due to gravitational lensing @xcite , could help to determine the position of sgr a * very accurately .",
    "enhanced microlensing caused by black holes surrounding sgr a * has also been considered @xcite . a fascinating possibility is offered by stars orbiting very close to sgr a * , which have now been followed very accurately across several years @xcite .",
    "in fact , the precise knowledge of the position of the source allows to predict the time , the position and the brightness of the secondary image @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , our knowledge about the central regions of the andromeda galaxy ( m31 ) has grown considerably .",
    "@xcite has provided a detailed brightness and density profile for the bulge and the disk of m31 , which is still the reference for present works .",
    "@xcite discovered that the nucleus of m31 is actually constituted by two components , which they called p1 and p2 .",
    "@xcite noticed that p2 is much brighter than p1 in the ultraviolet .",
    "then @xcite hypothesized that p1 and p2 are actually parts of the same eccentric disk orbiting a supermassive black hole , with p1 being formed by stars at the apocenter and p2 being formed by stars at the pericenter .",
    "later on , @xcite discovered a bright cluster of young stars ( named p3 ) embedded within p2 .",
    "they also managed to give the most precise estimate for the mass of the central black hole of m31 , @xmath8 m@xmath9 .",
    "recently , @xcite have cast doubt on the hypothesis that the p3 cluster is made of young stars of spectral class a5  b5 , proposing that it is actually made of old stars . on the other hand ,",
    "@xcite have supported the young - stars hypothesis suggesting a mechanism for the refuelling of gas in the neighborhood of the central black hole .",
    "it is very interesting to note that the supermassive black hole in the center of m31 is nearly two orders of magnitudes heavier than the black hole in our galaxy , estimated to @xmath10 m@xmath9 by @xcite . from the lensing point of view",
    ", the greater distance of m31 with respect to sgr a * is therefore partly compensated by the larger mass of its central black hole .",
    "this motivates a deep investigation of the probability of having stellar sources lensed by the supermassive black hole in m31 .",
    "gravitational lensing effects have been successfully employed in several contexts as a tool to study the structure of galaxies , large - scale structures and cosmological parameters @xcite . as we will show in this paper",
    ", it is not unlikely that gravitational lensing by the supermassive black hole in m31 will follow the wake of its ancestors . with a conspicuous number of events it will be possible to undertake a precise reconstruction of the mass distribution in the inner core of m31 .",
    "gravitational lensing would then provide an independent and unbiased method to be crossed with other investigation methods such as object counting , spectroscopic or proper motion measurements and so on .",
    "indeed the study of the physics of the core of m31 would greatly benefit from these new data , which will help to understand the physics of the stellar environment of supermassive black holes and possiblly shed light on the true origin of these enigmatic objects .    in this paper , we shall exploit the present knowledge of the bulge and the disk populations in m31 to calculate the expected number of simultaneously lensed sources for a given threshold magnitude in either the @xmath11-band or the @xmath2-band",
    ". we will also consider sources belonging to the central clusters , modelling p1 and p2 as components of a single eccentric system and p3 as a separate inner stellar cluster surrounding the central black hole .",
    "for each of the four populations ( disk , bulge , p1+p2 , p3 ) , we shall present several probability distributions characterizing the properties of the lensing events .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : in   2 we indicate our reference models for the source populations and describe their features . in   3 we review some basics on gravitational lensing , with particular reference to the black hole in m31 . in   4",
    "we present our estimates for the number of lensed sources at any given time for a given threshold magnitude of the secondary image . in   5 we examine the contribution of sources of different magnitude to the total number of events . in ",
    "6 we give the distribution of events as a function of the source distance . in   7 we show the distribution of the angular positions of the images .",
    "in   8 we present the distribution of their apparent angular velocities . in ",
    "9 we estimate the rate and the average duration of the lensing events . in   10 we discuss some issues concerning the identification of the lensing events .",
    "  11 contains the conclusions .",
    "our aim is to calculate lensing probabilities for four different populations of stellar sources around the supermassive black hole in the center of m31 , namely p3 , p1+p2 , the bulge and the disk .",
    "we therefore introduce specific models for each population containing information on their spatial distribution , kinematic properties and luminosity function , which are the necessary elements for the calculation of the lensing probabilities to be treated in the succeeding sections .    for all populations ,",
    "we choose to normalize the spatial distribution @xmath12 to unity , so that the quantity @xmath13 represents the probability of finding a single star of the population @xmath14 in the space element @xmath15 .",
    "we shall present gravitational lensing probability estimates for hypothetic observation programs in the @xmath2-band ( @xmath16 0.55 @xmath17 m ) or in the @xmath11-band ( @xmath16 2.2 @xmath17 m ) .",
    "the @xmath11-band presents some considerable advantages for this kind of research , since the interstellar extinction is lower in the near infrared than in the visible .",
    "in fact , in the @xmath11-band the total average extinction ( m31 + our galaxy ) is @xmath18 @xcite , whereas in the @xmath2-band we have @xmath19 .",
    "the latter value can be deduced by adding the intrinsic extinction of the m31 galaxy @xmath20 ( half the value given by @xcite , since our sources are close to the center of m31 ) to the foreground extinction @xmath21 @xcite . moreover ,",
    "large ground - based telescopes are optimized for interferometry in the infrared bands . in the most powerful configuration",
    ", they can reach resolutions of order the mas .",
    "such capability would be very precious for the detection of secondary images generated in gravitational lensing events .",
    "even the forthcoming _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ is designed to carry instruments for deep infrared imaging @xcite . on the other hand , the @xmath2-band is less affected by background noise .",
    "furthermore , at the diffraction limit , the @xmath2-band enjoys a resolution 4 times better than the @xmath11-band , though large interferometers operating in the visible bands are still far to come .    in any case , by comparing the results in the two bands we get a much deeper understanding on the source selection operated by the gravitational lensing phenomenon . since the stellar populations have different luminosity functions in the two bands , all gravitational lensing distributions look different , with some features exalted or depressed .",
    "this also allows a quick double - check of our results .    on the basis of this choice ,",
    "we need the luminosity functions of each source population both in the @xmath11-band and in the @xmath2-band . in the @xmath11-band",
    ", this function will be expressed as @xmath22 , defined so that @xmath23 represents the number of stars belonging to the population @xmath14 with absolute magnitude in the range @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "the total number of stars belonging to the population @xmath14 is recovered after integration on all magnitudes @xmath25    the same definitions hold for the @xmath2-band , with the obvious changes in the notation .",
    "the following subsections explain the construction of the luminosity functions and the choice of the spatial distribution for each stellar population .",
    "[ [ p3 ] ] p3 ~~    the cluster p3 was discovered by @xcite through spectroscopic observations using the _ hubble space telescope ( hst)_. although this cluster is embedded within p2 ( see   [ sec p2 ] ) , it is characterized by a distinct stellar population and different kinematic properties , strongly indicating that it must be considered as a separate entity .",
    "the characteristics of p3 are consistent with the hypothesis of a circular disk of stars in keplerian rotation around the central supermassive black hole .",
    "in particular , @xcite used two models to fit the spectroscopic observations : an exponential flat disk and a @xcite triaxial model .",
    "the best fits were obtained with the flat disk or a thin schwarzschild model , with axial ratio 0.26 . as a reasonable synthesis of the models explored by @xcite , we choose a classical thick - disk spatial distribution @xmath26 \\mathrm{sech}^2\\left[\\frac{z}{z_\\mathrm{p3}}\\right]\\ ] ] with the disk scale being @xmath27 pc and thickness @xmath28 pc .",
    "the inclination of the disk relative to the line of sight is @xmath29 , similar to that of the system p1+p2 .",
    "the rotation curve of p3 is symmetric around its center , reaching a rotation velocity @xmath30 and dispersion @xmath31 .    for the luminosity function of p3",
    "we have followed @xcite , who use the synthetic color - magnitude diagram generated by the program iac - star by @xcite .",
    "we have run this program with the same parameters , accepting the hypothesis that p3 was generated by a single starburst that occurred 200 myr ago in a gas cloud with solar metallicity ( see @xcite for an alternative proposal ) .",
    "we adopt a @xcite initial mass function .",
    "the algorithm has returned us @xmath32 stars with @xmath33 .",
    "such a number turns out to be insufficient for a substantial covering of the giant stars branches .",
    "we have thus generated a second sample of @xmath32 stars with @xmath34 and combined the two samples with appropriate weights .",
    "the two samples are shown together in two different color - magnitude diagrams in figure [ fig lump3 ] .",
    "the cut - off at @xmath35 does not translate into a sharp cut - off in the @xmath2-band .",
    "however , the sample is completely unaffected for @xmath36 , which we take as our cut - off in the luminosity function in the @xmath2-band .",
    "it is important to stress that gravitational - lensing observations select very bright sources with much higher probability than faint ones .",
    "for this reason , we do not pay much attention to the completeness of our simulated samples of stars on the low - luminosity side . in the same way , issues concerning the lower cutoff of the initial mass function are not relevant for us .",
    "all gravitational lensing probabilities are practically insensitive to changes in the source distribution function at low luminosities .",
    "this statement is also supported _ a posteriori _ by the distributions presented in ",
    "[ sec mag ] .",
    "note that the red giant branch ( rgb ) lies at almost fixed magnitude in the @xmath2-band , whereas it spans 6 magnitudes in the @xmath11-band up to the tip .",
    "the normalization of our sample of p3 stars has been performed introducing a factor @xmath37 multiplying the total number of stars .",
    "the value of @xmath37 has been deduced by comparing the total magnitude in the @xmath2-band of our artificial set with the total magnitude of p3 as deduced by @xcite , being @xmath38 .",
    "@xmath39 where @xmath40 is the unnormalized absolute magnitude of our combined sample .",
    "also this normalization procedure on the number of stars deduced by the total luminosity is largely insensitive to the abundance of low - luminosity stars .",
    "finally , the same set of stars has been used to build a binned luminosity function in the @xmath11-band and in the @xmath2-band , normalized in the way just described .",
    "the values of these binned functions are shown in tables [ tab lumk ] and [ tab lumv ] , together with those of the other source populations , to be discussed in the succeeding sections .    the different orientation of the rgb in the @xmath2-band and in the @xmath11-band is reflected in the luminosity function , which is zero in the @xmath2-band up to @xmath41 , whereas it is already non - zero in the @xmath11-band at @xmath42 .",
    "the @xmath11-band luminosity function clearly shows a red clump at @xmath43 , which is not as clear in the @xmath2-band , where it overlaps the stars at the turn - off point ( top ) of the main sequence ( ms ) .",
    "it is worth noting that the real number of stars in p3 should be of order a few thousands , whereas we have simulated @xmath44 stars in order to have a statistically significant sample .",
    ".binned luminosity functions in the @xmath11-band for p3 , p1+p2 , the bulge and the disk of m31 .",
    "as each bin spans 0.5 magnitudes , the number of stars in each bin is just the tabulated value of @xmath45 multiplied by 0.5 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the number of expected events as calculated in the previous section is obtained by integrating over the whole range of possible magnitudes for the sources .",
    "it is interesting to evaluate the contributions of sources with different magnitudes to the final result . in figure [ fig dndk ]",
    "we show the integrand of equation ( [ npj ] ) for all four populations as a function of the source magnitude @xmath46 and the threshold magnitude @xmath47 . for each value of @xmath48",
    "the function @xmath49 has been normalized to unity .",
    "figure [ fig dndv ] shows the same distributions in the @xmath2-band .",
    "schematically , we can say that low luminosity stars are more numerous , whereas brighter stars enjoy a larger lensing zone and consequently a larger lensing probability .",
    "the surfaces in figures [ fig dndk ] and [ fig dndv ] are the outcome of the interplay of these two opposite tensions . at lower thresholds ,",
    "the distributions are peaked on the most luminous stars .",
    "as we increase the threshold , less luminous populations become predominant .    as regards the @xmath11-band , in the distributions shown in figure [ fig dndk ] we can clearly identify the tip of the rgb in the high luminosity peak dominating at lower values of the threshold . at intermediate values of @xmath48 ,",
    "the red clump gives the highest contribution . at fainter thresholds , the stars at the top",
    "become significant and finally overtake the red clump .",
    "it is interesting to note that the top peak gradually shifts to dimmer values of @xmath46 as @xmath48 is increased and less luminous stars of the main sequence come into play . in the disk distribution , the brighter main sequence stars and the rsg also contribute to the first peak at low threshold values .    in the @xmath2-band ,",
    "the difference between the four populations is made more manifest .",
    "we can note that p1+p2 and the bulge are characterized by just two peaks : the one at higher luminosities is due to the red clump at @xmath50 and the dimmer at @xmath51 is made up of stars at the top .",
    "the rgb is almost horizontal and therefore there is no other peak at lower values of @xmath52 . in p3 the red clump and the top",
    "give rise to two consecutive peaks at @xmath53 and @xmath50 respectively .",
    "as the threshold is increased , the distribution flattens because of the contribution of progressively fainter stars coming into play .",
    "the disk distributions start with the peak at @xmath54 due to the rsg , which are absent in the other populations .",
    "these stars give rise to the different behavior of the disk at low thresholds , already discussed in the previous section . at intermediate thresholds",
    "the red clump becomes dominant and is later followed by the top contribution , which first forms a shoulder to the red clump peak and then becomes dominant .",
    "another important point can be anticipated noting that the distributions for p1+p2 and the bulge are always practically identical .",
    "this proves that differences in the spatial distribution have very little influence in selecting the class of sources ( luminous or dim ) for gravitational lensing .",
    "this point will be better explained in the next section , where we show that the magnitude and distance distributions can be factorized in a first approximation .    as a final consideration , we see that the contribution of stars at @xmath55 or @xmath56 is always negligible for the thresholds considered in this paper .",
    "this provides an _ a posteriori _ justification of the irrelevance of the faint end issue of the luminosity function in our calculations , as anticipated in ",
    "[ sec source ] .",
    "the four source populations considered in this paper fill different regions of m31 , at various distances from the center .",
    "it is interesting to calculate the distribution of the sources suffering gravitational lensing as a function of their distance from the central black hole @xmath57 .",
    "actually , since the distributions are spread over several orders of magnitudes in distance , we prefer to present the distributions in @xmath58 . in order to get this distribution for each population",
    ", we return to equations ( [ pipj ] ) and ( [ npj ] ) and reverse the order of integration in @xmath57 and @xmath46 @xmath59    the distributions so - obtained are shown in figure [ fig dnddls ] , after having been normalized to unity .",
    "the plots are obtained for @xmath60 , but the distributions for different thresholds and even for different bands are practically indistinguishable .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the radius of the lensing zone @xmath61 is always much smaller than the scale of variation of all spatial distributions .",
    "then it is possible to approximate the spatial distributions in the integrals ( [ pipj ] ) and ( [ dnddls ] ) with the values they assume at the center of the disk of radius @xmath61 and replace the integral over @xmath62 and @xmath63 by @xmath64 .",
    "since the dependence on @xmath57 in the radius of the lensing zone factors out , being always @xmath65 , the spatial distribution and the magnitude distributions are effectively factorized .",
    "this decoupling is not possible when we consider the angular position and the velocity of the images , as will be shown in the succeeding sections .",
    "the maximum lensing probability is reached by p3 at @xmath66 pc , by p1+p2 at @xmath67 pc , by the bulge at @xmath68 kpc and by the disk at @xmath69 kpc . with respect to the other populations",
    ", the distribution of the bulge events is less localized and presents a first subpeak at 5 pc .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that although the bulge is sharply peaked at the center of the galaxy , it has a long tail decreasing at a lower rate with respect to the exponential tail characterizing the other distributions .",
    "moreover , the other populations are more or less flattened on planes that never contain the line of sight , whereas the bulge has a more spheroidal shape .",
    "from the observational point of view , it is very important to determine the expected angular distance from the central black hole of the secondary images we are looking for . in practice ,",
    "the choice of the facilities to employ in the search for these images is heavily influenced by the resolution required to resolve them . in this section ,",
    "we derive the distribution of the secondary images generated by gravitational lensing with respect to their angular distance from the central black hole .    suppose we want to calculate the fraction of sources belonging to a given population that generate a secondary image at an angular distance in the range @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "the angular position of these sources is determined through equation ( [ lenseq ] ) as a function of @xmath71 and @xmath57 .",
    "we thus have to sum up the contributions of sources at different @xmath57 . considering that @xmath72 is a growing function of @xmath57 ,",
    "the first contribution comes from a source at distance @xmath73 such that @xmath74 .",
    "this distance can be explicitly calculated using equations ( [ lenseq ] ) and ( [ thetaein ] ) .",
    "the last contribution comes from sources at the border of the lensing zone , whose distance @xmath75 is such that @xmath76 .",
    "this distance is also easily calculable ( note that the absolute value is necessary because we are considering secondary images , i.e. images with @xmath77 ) .",
    "finally , for each source distance in the range @xmath78 $ ] , we must sum up the contributions of all space elements lying on a circle of radius @xmath79 centered on the optical axis at distance @xmath57 from the black hole .    as in the previous section ,",
    "we prefer to calculate the distribution in @xmath80 . taking proper account of all the jacobians , we have @xmath81    equation ( [ dndtheta ] ) is for observations in the @xmath11-band .",
    "the distribution for observations in the @xmath2-band can be calculated similarly with the obvious replacements .",
    "note that now it is impossible to factor the dependence on @xmath57 , @xmath48 and @xmath46 as done in the previous section . as a consequence ,",
    "the distribution of the angular positions of the images strongly depends on the threshold magnitude chosen .    in figures [ fig dndthetak ] and [ fig dndthetav ]",
    "we show the distributions ( normalized to unity at each threshold ) for each source population and for values of the threshold magnitude ranging from 20 to 30 in the @xmath11-band and from 23 to 33 in the @xmath2-band respectively .",
    "the images of sources belonging to p3 have angular distance in the range @xmath82 $ ] , those belonging to p1+p2 appear at a few mas from the central black hole , those in the disk have angular distance in the range @xmath83 $ ] , whereas sources in the bulge can generate images with a larger spread of angular distances , from @xmath84 to @xmath6 . in general , as we increase the threshold magnitude , the distributions move to slightly lower values of @xmath71 .",
    "this can be understood by the fact that lowering the threshold we accept fainter images generated by sources more distant from the optical axis , whose secondary images appear closer to the black hole . in practice , as a general rule , we learn that , in order to catch all fainter images one gets by performing deeper observations , one also needs better resolution .",
    "this shift is partly compensated by the existence of numerous intrinsically dim stars , which anyway need a very good alignment in order to generate a visible secondary image .",
    "these dim stars tend to keep the distribution at the highest possible value of @xmath71 , essentially fixed by the einstein angle at the typical distance scale of the population .    apart from this general behavior",
    ", we can clearly identify some of the populations discussed in ",
    "[ sec mag ] .",
    "for example , in the distribution for p3 in the @xmath11-band we can clearly distinguish three peaks at high threshold , corresponding to the tip of the rgb , the red clump and the top from left to right .",
    "these peaks are more smoothed in the distributions for p1+p2 and the disk . in the bulge ,",
    "the double peak structure is mainly determined by its spatial distribution , which presents a long tail extending up to a few kpc .",
    "this long tail is responsible for the peak at @xmath85 .",
    "this can be seen by the fact that at @xmath86 , at which we expect a single peak due to the tip of the rgb , we already have two evident peaks .",
    "moreover , the same structure can be seen in the @xmath2-band distribution , notwithstanding the different magnitude distribution .",
    "the @xmath2-band distributions appear to be less structured with just a very slight shift to lower values of @xmath71 with the increase of @xmath87 .    summing up",
    ", we note that imaging the central regions of the nucleus of m31 with a resolution of the order of a few mas , as could be possible with the keck or the lbt , will allow to catch secondary images of sources in the disk and a large part of those in the bulge , provided one reaches a faint enough @xmath48 ( see discussion in   [ sec i d ] ) .",
    "up to now , we have just calculated the number of gravitational lensing events that are observable at a given time .",
    "it is very important to understand the timescale of the variations of the geometric configuration of such lensing events .",
    "in fact , the strategies for the observations tightly depend on these timescales and can be very different for static or nearly static configurations as opposed to events with any secular development . as will be discussed in   [ sec i d ] , the detection of the motion of the images might be of key importance to identify genuine gravitational lensing events .",
    "this section is devoted to the presentation of the distributions of the expected velocities of the secondary images below a given threshold magnitude .",
    "these distributions are obtained by a montecarlo procedure . for each value of @xmath46 and @xmath48 ,",
    "we have generated @xmath88 stars , randomly choosing their position within the lensing zone corresponding to these magnitudes .",
    "the velocities of these sources have been randomly extracted from a two - dimensional gaussian distribution centered on the rotation velocity @xmath89 with dispersion @xmath90 .",
    "the values of these parameters are specified in ",
    "[ sec source ] for each population .",
    "once the sources have been generated , we have calculated the apparent proper motions of the corresponding secondary images by differentiating the standard formula for the position of the secondary image .",
    "the result is    @xmath91    where @xmath92 is the modulus of the time derivative of the angular position of the secondary image , @xmath93 is the modulus of the transverse velocity of the source and @xmath63 is the angle between the velocity and position vectors of the source .",
    "the image velocity decreases as @xmath94 when the source is far away from the optical axis . in this limit , the secondary image is also very faint and close to the black hole . in the opposite limit ,",
    "when @xmath95 , the velocity diverges ( except for the case @xmath96 ) .",
    "this is very well - known in microlensing studies , as the secondary image moves very rapidly when the source is at the closest approach distance .",
    "with the velocities of the images thus calculated , we have constructed the distributions shown in figures [ fig dndvk ] and [ fig dndvv ] for the @xmath11-band and @xmath2-band respectively .",
    "the proper motion has been expressed in milliarcseconds per year .",
    "the expected apparent proper motions of the secondary images cover a very large range .",
    "all four populations generate images whose velocities generally lie between @xmath97 and @xmath98 mas@xmath99y , with very long tails extending one order of magnitude above and below these limits .    going from lower to higher thresholds , all distributions significantly drift to lower values of the proper motion .",
    "this is clear from the fact that , at bright thresholds , very good alignments generate higher velocities as it is evident from equation ( [ vtheta ] ) and viceversa .",
    "then , going to fainter thresholds , the lensing zone is enlarged , and less aligned sources participate in the distribution pulling it to lower values of @xmath92 .",
    "this is particularly evident in the @xmath2-band .",
    "thanks to the stronger dependence of the velocity distributions on the threshold magnitude , the internal structure of the four populations in terms of stellar components is made more evident . in the @xmath11-band",
    "we can clearly identify three peaks moving from right to left as @xmath48 is increased from 20 to 30 . as usual , the peak on the left is due to the tip of the rgb , the central peak is due to the red clump and the one on the right is made up of top stars , coming into play at higher thresholds . in the @xmath2-band there is a first peak formed by red clump stars moving from high to low values of @xmath92 . at high thresholds the top stars are able to form a shoulder and then a second peak on the right of the red clump peak . at low values of @xmath87 the disk distribution",
    "is influenced by rsg , which form the tail at small @xmath92 .",
    "the contribution of rsg becomes subdominant already at intermediate thresholds , where it is taken over by red clump stars and finally by top stars .",
    "an interesting quantity for the definition of the timescale of observational campaigns is the rate of the events , defined as the number of new detectable events occurring per unit time .",
    "it can be calculated by @xmath100 where @xmath101\\ ] ] and @xmath102 is the modified bessel function of order @xmath103 .",
    "the combination @xmath104 is the result of the integration on the velocity distribution , again assumed to be a gaussian with dispersion @xmath90 centered on the rotation velocity @xmath89 . for further details on this point ,",
    "see the appendix of @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath105 satisfies the following limits @xmath106    applying equation ( [ rate ] ) to each of our four populations , we obtain the curves in figure [ fig rate ] .",
    "we see that the more distant populations move more slowly and thus generate new events at a lower rate . for this reason the rate of the bulge events practically coincides with the rate of p1+p2 , while the rate of the disk drops to levels comparable to those of p3 .",
    "having calculated both the rate and the number of simultaneously present events , we immediately derive the average time spent by an event above threshold as @xmath107 where the last equality holds approximatively and involves the average radius of the lensing zone @xmath108 , and the average transverse velocity @xmath109 .",
    "the average duration of the events for each source population are drawn in figure [ fig deltat ] .",
    "it grows with the chosen threshold of the experiment .",
    "this is due to the fact that as @xmath48 is increased the lensing zone becomes larger and larger and the time required by the sources to cross it becomes proportionally larger ( see the approximate expression in eq .",
    "[ [ deltat ] ] ) .",
    "the modulation in the growth at intermediate thresholds in the @xmath11-band is again an effect of the presence of different stellar branches in each population .",
    "in fact , at low @xmath48 most of the events are due to bright sources in the red clump . given their intrinsic luminosity , these sources generate secondary images that stay longer above threshold . at intermediate thresholds , there emerges a non - negligible contribution from fainter sources .",
    "these sources have a smaller lensing zone and their secondary images spend much less time above threshold with respect to the brighter sources .",
    "the distribution of the average duration becomes bimodal , with the brighter sources enjoying a long time above threshold and the fainter sources spending less time above threshold .",
    "the average time of such a bimodal distribution is therefore in the middle between the two maxima .",
    "as we increase @xmath48 further , the fainter sources dominate with respect to the brighter and @xmath110 is determined by these sources only .",
    "then the modulation observed at intermediate @xmath48 in the curves in figure [ fig deltat ] is just the transition from a regime dominated by more luminous sources to a regime dominated by dimmer sources . in the @xmath2-band",
    "this transition is less evident .",
    "coming to a quantitative analysis of the average duration , we note that the events involving sources in the disk of m31 last up to several centuries . for the bulge the average time spent above threshold ranges from 50 to 200 years .",
    "for p1+p2 the situation is more dynamical , thanks to the higher velocities characterizing the stars very close to the central black hole .",
    "an observational campaign lasting several years could study the evolution of the secondary images already present and hope to see new events ( if the threshold magnitude is sufficiently high ) .",
    "the average duration of the events involving sources in p3 is of the order of one year , but the extremely low rate of new events for this population leads one to discard it as a source of gravitational lensing events .",
    "on the basis of the analysis given in the previous sections , it is time to set up a realistic methodology to select the candidate lensing images and test their authenticity .    as mentioned before , the most probable lensing events will involve bulge stars as sources , at typical distances ranging from a few pc to 1 kpc from the lens . in this configuration",
    ", the secondary images may form at an angular distance from the central black hole ranging from a few mas to @xmath6 . in order to get access to the bulk of the gravitational lensing events",
    ", it is then mandatory to employ interferometry . at this point",
    ", the question arises whether a secondary image of a lensed star can be distinguished from a background star unambiguously .    in this respect",
    ", it is instructive to calculate the expected number of background stars in an angular area within radius @xmath71 centered on the black hole . for a threshold magnitude @xmath47 , only the sources with observed magnitude @xmath111 will be observable .",
    "this fixes a threshold on the intrinsic magnitude of the sources as @xmath112    the number of background sources is then @xmath113    actually , since the spatial distributions for all source populations are centered on the black hole and have an extent much smaller than @xmath114 , we can take the approximation @xmath115 and push the lower extremum in the @xmath116-integral to @xmath117 .",
    "let us imagine an observational campaign to discover secondary images due to gravitational lensing lying within @xmath118 of the central black hole .",
    "fixing @xmath60 , the number of background stars in such area is @xmath119 , @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "our image will thus contain something like 12 stars within @xmath123 from the central black hole .",
    "the first step would be to check for possible alignments between these stars and the central black hole .",
    "if we find that the line joining two stars passes through the central black hole , we can select these stars as candidate lensing images of the same source .",
    "since gravitational lensing is an achromatic phenomenon , the two images must have the same color indices ( unless there is reason to believe that the photon paths of the two images cross regions with sensibly different amount of dust ) .",
    "therefore , false candidates could be excluded taking images in different ir bands and checking whether the luminosity ratio between the two images remains the same in all bands .",
    "a further test is to take another image after several months or even the next year .",
    "if the alignment is just a chance product and one of the two stars has a high enough proper motion ( which is likely to happen if the star is intrinsically close to the central black hole ) , then the alignment will be lost in the second image .",
    "conversely , if the alignment is an authentic product of gravitational lensing , and if any evolution shows up , then the two images must move in such a way that the line joining them always passes through the black hole .",
    "however , as shown in in   [ sec vel ] , the proper motion of the secondary images is typically below @xmath98 mas@xmath99y . therefore , it would be improbable that the observed events show any evolution within less than ten years .",
    "moreover , given the very low rate of new events , follow - up observations would make sense only if thresholds higher than @xmath124 are reached in the observations .",
    "our estimate of 12 background stars in an area of radius @xmath123 centered on the black hole is based on our spatial distributions , which do not take into account a possible presence of a further cuspy cluster of stars internal to p3 and thus very close to the supermassive black hole .",
    "if such a cluster were present , then the number of background stars would sensibly increase .",
    "however , these stars would move very fast and chance alignments in a first image would be easily discarded after the analysis of a second image . as stressed before , the most delicate background actually comes from stars that lie along the line of sight but intrinsically far from the black hole and consequently have slow proper motion .",
    "we believe that the number of these stars is correctly estimated through equation ( [ bpj ] ) . for completeness",
    ", we also mention that the estimate of background stars for @xmath124 yields 1600 stars and for @xmath125 gives 1320 stars .    as a final consideration",
    ", we note that the deformation of the point - like image of the source is of the order of @xmath126 arcsec for the gravitational lensing events considered in this work .",
    "this prevents from using image deformation as a selection tool for lensing effects .",
    "in this paper we have undertaken a deep investigation of the possible observation of gravitational lensing effects due to the black hole in the center of m31 .",
    "we have considered stars belonging to four different populations ( bulge , disk and the central clusters p1+p2 and p3 ) as candidate sources . through detailed modelling of the spatial distributions and the luminosity functions of these four populations",
    "we have calculated several quantities that can be used to quantify the power of the central black hole as a gravitational lens using present and future observational facilities .",
    "we have carried out our analysis both in the @xmath11-band and in the @xmath2-band .",
    "the main outcome is the number of expected lensed sources at a given time whose secondary image is brighter than a specified threshold magnitude .",
    "the results are summarized in figure [ fig nevents ] and tables [ tab neventsk ] and [ tab neventsv ] , showing that indeed we expect 1.4 lensed sources at a threshold @xmath60 , 16 events at @xmath127 and 180 events at @xmath124 . in the @xmath2-band",
    "we would have 1.3 events at @xmath128 , 25 events at @xmath129 and 270 events at @xmath125 .",
    "we have also presented the distribution of the lensed sources as a function of their absolute magnitude , showing the contribution of different stellar branches as sources of gravitational lensing events .    the distribution of the lensed sources as a function of the distance shows that the disk stars are mostly lensed at about 1 kpc distance from the black hole , whereas the bulge stars can be lensed at distances ranging from a few pc to 1 kpc .",
    "the inner cluster stars are lensed at fractions of a pc .",
    "this difference is reflected in the angular separation of the images from the black hole , which ranges from 1 mas to @xmath6 for bulge and disk stars , whereas it stays of the order 1 mas or below for the inner clusters .",
    "the resolution needed to get a significant number of events is thus of the order of a few mas , requiring the employment of long baseline interferometers or extremely large telescopes .",
    "this justifies our choice to present our analysis in the @xmath11-band , for which the present infrared interferometers such as keck , lbt and the future space telescope jwst are optimized .",
    "the vlti , though representing the most advanced interferometer operating in ir bands , can not observe m31 efficiently .",
    "the parallel analysis in the @xmath2-band provides a deeper comprehension of all the effects coming into play . in this band ,",
    "the expectations for the number of lensing events are comparable to those in the @xmath11-band , provided that @xmath2-band interferometers are constructed in the future with sizes of the same order as in the @xmath11-band .",
    "the gravitational lensing events discussed in this paper have a very slow evolution , with typical angular velocities of the images between @xmath97 and @xmath98 mas@xmath99y .",
    "we have outlined a possible observational strategy to select gravitational lensing events within the expected background stars , by checking the alignment of pairs of images , the achromaticity of the flux ratio and setting up follow - up observations to detect any secular development .",
    "our analysis can be repeated with different models of the source populations .",
    "given the present uncertainties on the morphology of the components of m31 , we believe that our estimates can be corrected by a factor of a few at most .",
    "the chances for concrete observations of gravitational lensing events by the supermassive black hole in m31 are rather low ( though not null ) even with the best facilities available today .",
    "the perspectives will be definitely increased with the realization of future projects such as the jwst , the extremely large ground telescopes or the realization of new long baseline optical interferometers in the northern hemisphere . with such facilities it should be possible to reach the higher thresholds indicated in this paper while keeping a very high angular resolution .",
    "this would open the way to an intensive research of gravitational lensing events and to their use in the investigation of the environment of the supermassive black hole .",
