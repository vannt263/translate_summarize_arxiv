    "a vertically extended layer known as the reynolds layer or the warm ionized medium ( wim ) of the milky way contains the majority of the ionized gas in the interstellar medium .",
    "the layer fills about 20% of the ism volume with a local midplane density of @xmath50.1 @xmath6 and a scale height of @xmath51 kpc ( reynolds 1993 ) .",
    "energetic arguments favor photo - ionization by massive stars in the disk for the layer s maintenance , as roughly 15% their ionizing output is sufficient to maintain the layer in the solar neighborhood ( reynolds 1993 ) .",
    "the wisconsin h@xmath2 mapper ( wham ; reynolds et .",
    "1998b ) has been instrumental in recent years in characterizing the wim . in external galaxies ,",
    "where the layer is more commonly referred to as diffuse ionized gas ( dig ) , analogous information has been obtained through the use of narrow - band emission - line imaging , long - slit spectroscopy , and fabry - perot observations [ e.g. rand , kulkarni , & hester 1990 ( hereafter rkh ) ; rand 1996 , 1997 , 1998 ; golla , dettmar , & domgrgen 1996 ; ferguson , wyse , & gallagher 1996 ; wang , heckman , & lehnert 1997 ; hoopes , walterbos , & rand 1999 ; collins et .",
    "( hereafter crdw ) ] .",
    "estimates of the diffuse fraction in dig layers put the ionization requirement closer to 40% of the massive stars ionizing output ( e.g. hoopes et .",
    "al . 1996 ; ferguson et . al . 1996 ) .",
    "the advantage in observing external edge - on galaxies is the ability to obtain an overview of the entire halo , so that brightness , spatial distribution , and emission line ratios can be better characterized as they vary with @xmath3 .",
    "one of the most important issues regarding these layers is their ionization . in the wim , as well as in external dig layers , [ ] @xmath7h@xmath2 and [ ] @xmath8h@xmath2",
    "are enhanced relative to [ ] regions [ e.g. haffner , reynolds , & tufte 1999 ( hereafter hrt ) ; ferguson , wyse , & gallagher 1996 ; rand 1997 ] .",
    "such a scenario is predicted by photo - ionization models in which the dilution of the radiation field , measured by the ionization parameter , @xmath9 , increases as photons propagate away from  regions [ domgrgen & mathis 1994 ; sokolowski 1994 ( hereafter s94 ) ; bland - hawthorn et . al .",
    "species such as s which are predominantly doubly ionized in  regions are able to recombine to a singly ionized state as the field becomes increasingly dilute .",
    "such an effect should not be as significant for n or o , which have considerably higher second ionization potentials and thus may not be fully doubly ionized in  regions .",
    "the photo - ionization scenario is not without problems , however .",
    "firstly , in an increasingly dilute field , photoionization models predict that the ratio [ ] / [ ] should increase with @xmath3 due to differing second ionization potentials of s and n. however , [ ] / [ ] vs. @xmath3 has been found to remain nearly constant in the wim ( hrt ) and ngc 891 ( rand 1998 ) , and in the case of ngc 4631 , the variations with @xmath3 are not as pronounced as those predicted by the models ( golla et al .",
    "in addition , the ratio [ ] @xmath10h@xmath2 should decrease with @xmath3 in a photo - ionization scenario as the field becomes increasingly dilute .",
    "the opposite trend , however , is seen in ngc 891 ( rand 1998 ) , where [ ] /h@xmath2 increases significantly from the midplane to @xmath0 kpc , as well as in ngc 5775 ( rand 2000 ; tllmann et .",
    "al . 2000 ) .",
    "[ ] /h@xmath2 enhancements in dig relative to  regions are also seen in a number of more face - on galaxies , including m51 ( wang et .",
    "finally , photoionization models have trouble explaining values of [ ] /h@xmath2 and [ ] /h@xmath2 that are often @xmath11 ( wang et .",
    "al . 1997 ; rand 1998 ; hrt ) .",
    "models of s94 , who took observed line ratios in ngc 891 into consideration , can only explain such ratios by assuming an upper mass cutoff for the stellar imf of @xmath12 , hardening of the radiation field as it propagates , and a depletion of important gas - phase coolants onto dust grains .",
    "observations of the weak  @xmath13 line , however , in the reynolds layer ( reynolds & tufte 1995 ) and in ngc 891 ( rand 1997 ) each imply a significantly softer spectrum than indicated by the forbidden lines .    one possibility that has been forwarded to explain some of this line ratio behavior is to assume a secondary ionizing source that contributes a small but increasing fraction of the h@xmath2 emission with @xmath3 .",
    "such secondary sources include shocks ( shull & mckee 1979 ) or turbulent mixing layers ( tmls ; slavin , shull , & begelman 1993 ) , each of which may produce large amounts of [ ] emission .",
    "other , less well - studied ionization sources may be relevant in halos , such as ionization from soft x - rays or cosmic rays .",
    "another approach that has been taken is to assume , instead of the ionization parameter or state changing with @xmath3 , that the line ratio behavior can be explained by the gas temperature increasing with @xmath3 .",
    "this requires a source of additional heating , such as photo - electric heating from dust grains ( reynolds & cox 1992 ) or dissipation of interstellar turbulence ( minter & balser 1997 ) , that becomes more significant at lower gas densities , but may not require any additional source of ionization .",
    "a temperature increase with @xmath3 is successful in explaining enhancements in [ ] /h@xmath2 and [ ] /h@xmath2 with @xmath3 , as well the constancy in [ ] / [ ] in the reynolds layer up to @xmath14 kpc ( hrt ; reynolds , haffner , & tufte 1999 ) .",
    "such a rise in temperature could also explain an increase in [ ] /h@xmath2 , though data on the run of [ ] /h@xmath2 vs. @xmath3 in the wim are currently lacking .",
    "the goal of this research is to attempt to better understand how dig halos are energized .",
    "we attempt to determine whether measured runs of line ratios versus @xmath3 can be explained by : ( _ a _ _ ) photo - ionization with a contribution from shock ionization that increases with height above the midplane , and/or ( _ b _ _ ) only photo - ionization , but with an increase in gas temperature with @xmath3 .",
    "we examine our data in the context of each of these scenarios , realizing that elements of both could be important for understanding the ionization of dig halos in general . to this end , we have obtained data for two galaxies : ngc 4302 and ugc 10288 .",
    "we also employ data for ngc 5775 , already presented by rand ( 2000 ) . for the purpose of assessing the rising temperature scenario , we use data for ngc 891 , which has been compared with composite shock / photo - ionization models previously ( rand 1998 ) .",

    "spectra for ugc 10288 and ngc 4302 were obtained at the kpno 4-m telescope on 1999 june 10 - 13 and 1998 february 23 - 26 , respectively .",

    "arc lamp exposures were used to calibrate the wavelength scale as a function of location along the slit , and the spectral response function was determined with standard stars .",
    "regions of the spectra free of emission from the galaxies were used to form sky - subtracted spectra . in order to increase sensitivity for the determination of line parameters , blocks of 5 pixels",
    "were averaged in the spatial direction . since gaussians appear to accurately represent the line profiles , gaussian fits were used to determine line properties .",
    "uncertainties in line parameters for ngc 4302 were determined with the iraf task _ splot . the use of this method for ngc 5775 and ugc 10288 yielded error bars that were far greater than uncertainties suggested by the data .",
    "in this case error bars were estimated by determining flux variations along the slit for sky lines of a range of intensities , from which a relation between these variances and sky line intensity could be established .",
    "this relation was then used to determine flux uncertainties for the various emission lines .",
    "uncertainties for h@xmath2 line strengths in ngc 5775 also take into account the coincidence of the h@xmath2 line with a blended pair of sky lines .",
    "this factor was not considered in the presentation of ngc 5775 line data in rand ( 2000 ) . _    in order to compare [ ] @xmath165007 emission to that of h@xmath2 it was necessary to make a reddening correction to the [ ] line in ngc 5775 , ugc 10288 , and ngc 891 .",

    "the h@xmath17 line is superposed on a weak stellar absorption line close to the midplane .",

    "the [ /h@xmath2 ratio ranges from about 0.02 in the midplane to 0.06 at @xmath30 kpc in slit 2 , while the [ ] @xmath31 line was not detected for slit 1 . because of the 85  ( irwin 1994 ) inclination of the galaxy , points within 10  of the midplane ( @xmath32 pc in the figures ) on the spatial axis reflect in - plane , highly inclined disk structure rather than true vertical structure . in these lines of sight ,",

    "we attempt to determine the h@xmath2 emission scale height , @xmath34 , of the galaxies dig halos at the various slit locations .",
    "we attempt to model only an exponential halo component , avoiding any disk component where contamination by bright  regions could complicate the analysis .",
    "we plot the logarithm of h@xmath2 intensity versus @xmath3 for each slit , then fit an exponential component with a least - squares fit except in cases where an exponential is obviously a bad description .",

    "results of the fitting procedure are summarized in table 2 .",
    "position 1 of ngc 5775 covers the ne filament , dig emission from which has been modeled previously ( crdw ) .",
    "the value @xmath35 pc is somewhat consistent with the value of @xmath36 kpc determined from image data .",
    "the image data however does include some [ ] contamination .",
    "the previously determined value assumes an [ ] /h@xmath2 ratio that does not vary with @xmath3 . since our data shows that this ratio in fact rises with @xmath3 on the ne filament , from 0.5 at @xmath0 kpc to 0.75 at @xmath37 kpc , the value @xmath36 kpc becomes an upper limit on the actual scale height .    the dig halos of ngc 4302 and ugc 10288 have been modeled previously as well ( rand 1996 ) . the slit position for ngc 4302 coincides with one of the previously modeled regions , the scale height of which was determined to be @xmath38 pc ( the image is not contaminated by [ ] emission ) .",
    "the values determined from spectroscopic data , @xmath39 pc and @xmath40 pc for the east and west sides , are close to those determined from image data .",
    "the scale height determined from the image , however , is an average over a 3 kpc radial extent of the disk and thus should not be in exact agreement with the spectroscopically determined value .",
    "image data of ugc 10288 revealed very little extraplanar h@xmath2 emission , and thus profiles were not well modeled with exponentials . increased sensitivity of the spectroscopic data",
    "have allowed the detection of h@xmath2 emission to greater @xmath3-heights .",
    "the resulting h@xmath2 profiles seem to be well modeled by exponentials with small scale heights on the south side , while more complicated structure is present on the north side .",
    "ngc 5775 , having the most prominent extraplanar dig emission , also has the dig halo with the greatest scale height .",
    "in contrast , ugc 10288 , showing very little extraplanar h@xmath2 emission , has a dig halo of relatively small scale height .",
    "ngc 4302 , having a number of extraplanar plumes of h@xmath2 emission , has a dig scale height intermediate between that of ngc 5775 and ugc 10288 .",
    "the halo of ngc 891 has been modeled previously ( rkh ) , the scale height of which has been measured to be @xmath41 kpc on the west side and @xmath42 kpc on the east side from imaging data .",
    "these results suggest that not only do galaxies such as ngc 5775 and ngc 891 have brighter dig halos , where sensitivity limits allow faint emission to be detected at much greater heights than for a galaxy with a lower h@xmath2 surface brightness , but the halos also have much larger scale heights .",
    "this adds further evidence to the notion of a dynamic halo where higher levels of star formation in the disk result in material driven further into the halo ( e.g. rand 1996 ; hoopes et .",
    "al . 1999 ) .",
    "some of the line ratio behavior observed in ngc 5775 and ugc 10288 , namely the rise in [ ] /h@xmath2 and [ ] /h@xmath2 with @xmath3 , is predicted by the photo - ionization models ( e.g. s94 ; bland - hawthorn 1997 ) .",
    "as previously stated , rises in these ratios are expected in such models as the radiation field becomes more dilute with @xmath3 .",
    "if the field is in fact becoming more dilute ( low values of the ionization parameter , @xmath9 , which measures the `` diluteness''of the radiation field and is proportional to the ratio of ionizing photon number density to gas density ) with @xmath3 , then the models predict that the [ ] /h@xmath2 ratio should decrease away from the midplane .",
    "however , in ngc 5775 , and to a lesser extent ugc 10288 , we see a definite incease in [ ] /h@xmath2 with @xmath3 , indicative of higher excitation conditions above the disk in such models ( high-@xmath9 ) .",
    "recent spectroscopy of ngc 5775 by tllmann et .",
    "al . ( 2000 ) also reveals a significant rise in [ ] /h@xmath2 with @xmath3 , though these data are not extinction corrected .",
    "it is then possible that the [ ] emission originates from a different dig component than that of the [ ] and [ ] .",
    "consequently , a secondary mechanism , such as shock ionization , could account for the bright [ ] emission above the plane .    in this section",
    "we explore the possibility that shock ionization is responsible for some of the dig emission in these galaxies .",
    "one could also consider tmls , since they also produce large amounts of [ ] emission .",
    "in fact in ngc 891 , tmls do just as well as shocks in fitting the observed data ( rand 1998 ) .",
    "our approach is that of rand ( 1998 ) , with some minor changes .",
    "we adopt the s94 matter - bounded photoionization model with the lowest terminal hydrogen column density , @xmath43 @xmath44 , of individual gas clumps .",
    "the s94 models feature a hard stellar spectrum ( an upper mass cutoff of @xmath12 ) , hardening of the radiation field as it propagates through the ism , and depletion of gas - phase coolants onto dust grains .",
    "we do not consider the s94 radiation - bounded model as this model predicts extremely bright [ ] emission .",
    "any composite shock model utilizing radiation - bounded models requires a very unusual secondary source of h@xmath2 emission . in the case of ngc 5775 ,",
    "such a scenario would require a secondary source that accounts for nearly half of the h@xmath2 emission at the midplane ( assuming log @xmath45 at @xmath33 kpc ) , and produces virtually no [ ] or [ ] emission .",
    "in addition , such a source must produce significant [ ] and [ ] emission at high-@xmath3 , and still contribute at least 50% of the total h@xmath2 emission .",
    "such emission characteristics could be explained with low - speed shocks near the midplane with a shock velocity increasing with @xmath3 . however , the problem is further complicated by the fact that low - speed shocks produce copious amounts of [ ] emission relative to [ ] .",
    "in addition , basic energetic arguments render such a scenario , where the secondary source contributes half of the layer s ionization , highly unlikely as the ionizing flux from massive stars exceeds supernovae power output , presumably the initiator of these shocks , by a factor of 6 or 7 ( reynolds 1984 , 1992 ) . in any case",
    ", parameters describing these shocks require considerable tweaking to account for the observed run of line ratios .",
    "matter - bounded models on the other hand , better match the data before composite modeling , and require a less complicated parameter space describing the secondary source .",
    "to obtain line ratios due to shock ionization , we use the models of shull & mckee ( 1979 ; hereafter sm79 ) .",
    "line ratios in these models , especially [ ] /h@xmath2 , are highly dependent on shock velocity .",
    "other variables affecting line ratios include the preshock gas density and ionization state , abundances , and transverse magnetic field strength .",
    "these models assume the gas to be initially neutral at @xmath46 @xmath6 , then penetrated by a precursor ionization front .",
    "more appropriate to the case of a partially photo - ionized dig layer , would be a initial density of order @xmath47 @xmath6 , and a high initial ionization fraction .",
    "we mainly consider the models with shock velocities of @xmath48 km s@xmath49 and @xmath50 km s@xmath49 in that these higher velocity models are best able to produce large amounts of [ ] emission , while keeping [ ] low relative to [ ] .",
    "sm79 also calculate a single model containing depleted abundances with @xmath48 km s@xmath49 , which we also consider in the modeling to allow a comparison between shock and photo - ionization models with depleted abundances .",
    "in general , though , we do not consider this analysis as providing a definitive measure of the shock speed in these composite models given the simplicity of the model and the many unrealistic parameters which describe the shocks .",
    "for the composite modeling , we assume that some fraction of h@xmath2 emission arises from shock ionization , with that fraction possibly changing with @xmath3 .",
    "we still assume a stellar radiation field distinguished by a decrease in ionization parameter , @xmath9 , with @xmath3 . to simplify matters",
    "we assume a single shock velocity for each composite model .",
    "we attempt to fit the composite model to the data by varying the percent contribution at a given value of @xmath9 ( and thus @xmath3 ) . for ngc 5775",
    "the modeling worked best by allowing shock contributions to begin at log @xmath51 , while models with shocks beginning at log @xmath52 worked best for ugc 10288 .",
    "such values are somewhat lower than would be expected for a low-@xmath3 radiation field .",
    "however , kinematics of edge - on galaxies indicate that at low-@xmath3 , the line emission we observe is mostly associated with the outer disk regions due to an absorbing dust layer .",
    "since star formation is typically concentrated in the inner disk , the radiation field in the outer disk may be relatively dilute , in which case , the value of @xmath9 at low-@xmath3 may be quite low ( rand 1998 ) .",
    "we do not carry out a statistical test of the goodness of fit since our goal is to qualitatively assess the feasibility of a secondary source of ionization being able to account for some of the line ratios .",
    "although no model reproduces the line ratios to within the errors , we do find that the composite models better reproduce the run of line ratios than photo - ionization models alone .",
    "rand ( 1998 ) finds a similar conclusion for ngc 891 , where composite modeling reproduces the run of [ ] /h@xmath17 vs. [ ] /h@xmath2 and [ ] /h@xmath2 , yet is unable to duplicate the [ ] / [ ] ratio at low-@xmath3 .",

    "however , the high values of [ ] /h@xmath2 in slit 1 do suggest a large contribution from shocks in those regions .",
    "it should be noted , though , that the galaxy has a fairly quiescent appearance in the h@xmath2 image with little extraplanar emission , calling into question the notion that shocks are permeating the ism .",
    "it would be useful to obtain more [ ] data for this galaxy to better diagnose the possible contributions from secondary ionization sources .",
    "nevertheless , a clear departure from a pure photoionization model is indicated by the data .      in this section , following the approach of hrt , we attempt to determine whether variations in line ratios with @xmath3 can be explained by a change in gas temperature as one moves off the midplane . a temperature increase with @xmath3 provides a simple explanation of why all ratios of forbidden lines to balmer lines are generally seen to increase with @xmath3 .",
    "in fact , hrt find for the reynolds layer that the increase in [ ] /h@xmath2 and [ ] /h@xmath2 , and the constancy of [ ] / [ ] with @xmath3 , up to @xmath14 kpc , can be accounted for by an increase in gas temperature alone , without having to invoke a secondary source of ionization .",
    "such a scenario requires additional non - ionizing heating for low - density , high-@xmath3 gas , such as photo - electric heating from dust grains ( reynolds & cox 1992 ) or dissipation of interstellar turbulence ( minter & balser 1997 ) . using line ratio data versus @xmath3 for ngc 4302 , ngc 5775 , ugc 10288 , and ngc 891",
    ", we attempt to test this scenario by determining gas temperatures as well as ionization fractions of constituent elements .    for collisionally excited ions , the equation for intensity of emission lines",
    "is given by osterbrock ( 1989 ) , @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the collision strength and energy of the transition , @xmath63 is the statistical weight of the ground level , @xmath64 is the temperature in units of 10@xmath19 k , and @xmath65 is the fraction of downward transitions that produce the emission line .    to simplify matters , we assume no change in physical conditions , namely temperature , density , ionization fraction , and gas abundance , along a given line - of - sight through the dig layer . such uniformity of physical parameters within the ism is clearly not accurate when lines - of - sight cross small scale structures such as  regions or shocks , where temperature or ionization conditions may change dramatically .",
    "the assumption is valid , however , if these parameters are thought of as averages along a given line of sight instead of describing localized conditions within the ism .    this assumption , along with the use of the collision strengths provided by aller ( 1984 ) , allows the intensity of [ ] , [ ] , and [ ] emission to be represented , in units of rayleighs , by :    @xmath66    @xmath67    and @xmath68    the intensity of h@xmath2 emission is given by , @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the emission measure in units of pc @xmath71 .",
    "a further simplification is to assume n@xmath72 and h@xmath72 have approximately equal ionization fractions .",
    "this assumption is justified for two reasons .",
    "first , photoionization models of s94 predict that n@xmath72/n@xmath73 tracks h@xmath72/h@xmath73 due to similar first ionization potentials ( 14.5 ev versus 13.6 ev ) and a weak charge exchange reaction .",
    "second , n is not likely to ionize higher than n@xmath72 in a pure photoionization scenario due to a second ionization potential of 29.6 ev ( hrt ) . a high ionization fraction of o@xmath4 , however , would imply a significant fraction in the n@xmath4 state as the second ionization potential of oxygen is 35.1 ev . thus we will be able to check the validity of this assumption with the [ ] /h@xmath2 data . due to this simplification , of the line ratios available from this data , [ ]",
    "/h@xmath2 is the best probe of gas temperature .",
    "the forbidden lines are all dependent on their abundance relative to atomic hydrogen .",
    "the issue of abundances is a complicated one , the understanding of which is critical for interpreting the line ratios .",
    "current evidence suggests that abundances in halo gas may be quite different from gas in the disk .",
    "savage and sembach ( 1996 ) find increasing gas - phase abundances in the milky way from disk to halo , possibly as a result of partial grain destruction due to shocks .",
    "however , models by sembach et .",
    "al . ( 2000 ; hereafter shrk ) predict that the ratios of forbidden lines to balmer lines tend to rise as abundances fall due to decreased cooling efficiency . for this reason ,",

    "however , observations of the [ ] @xmath163727 line , to complement [ ] @xmath165007 and [ ] @xmath166300 measurements , would be very useful to completely decouple line ratios ( which depend on excitation and temperature ) from variations in abundance . to simplify matters ,",

    "the data for ngc 5775 and ugc 10288 suggest that a significant fraction of oxygen is in the o@xmath4 state ; at least 15% and in some lines - of - sight nearly 100% relative to h@xmath72 .",
    "the second ionization potential of oxygen is 35.1 ev , while that of nitrogen is 29.6 ev .",
    "thus one would expect the ionization fractions of the doubly - ionized species of these two elements to roughly track one another in a warm medium .",

    "one possible explanation for the large ionization fractions of doubly - ionized species is that a secondary ionizing source with emission characteristics similar to shocks or tmls contributes to the layer s ionization .",
    "alternatively , the [ ] emitting gas could represent a component that is at a significantly higher temperature than the component responsible for the [ ] emission .",

    "the general trend for the runs of line ratios for ngc 4302 and ugc 10288 is very similar to that of ngc 5775 ( rand 2000 ) and ngc 891 ( rand 1998 ) : an increase in [ ] /h@xmath2 and [ ] /h@xmath2 with [ ] / [ ] remaining nearly constant with @xmath3 , though one slit position for ugc 10288 does show evidence for an increase in [ ] / [ ] with @xmath3 .",
    "determinations of halo emission scale height have revealed that the more prominent dig halos also have greater scale height .",
    "this is consistent with models of dynamic halos where greater levels of star formation in the disk can push material farther off the midplane .",
    "pure photo - ionization models do not explain the runs of line ratios in ngc 5775 and ugc 10288 .",
    "composite photo - ionization / shock models can replicate the run of [ ] /h@xmath2 vs. [ ] /h@xmath2 in ngc 5775 , though the run of [ ] /h@xmath2 vs. [ ] /h@xmath2 is still problematic , especially at low-@xmath3 .",
    "in addition , we find that the composite models require a greater percent contribution from shocks in filamentary than non - filamentary regions to match the run of [ ] /h@xmath2 .",
    "a lack of a discernible trend for the [ ] /h@xmath2 vs. [ ] /h@xmath2 run in ugc 10288 makes it difficult to determine whether shocks contribute to line emission , though the high values of [ ] /h@xmath2 in slit 1 indicate that a shock contribution may be necessary . a composite model , though , can account for the run of [ ] /h@xmath2 vs. [ ] /h@xmath2 .",
    "however , if it follows the trend seen in ngc 5775 of more disturbed regions requiring a larger shock contribution , then the lack of a bright , filamentary halo in ugc 10288 may imply that shocks do not play as significant a role in layer s ionization .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath2 vs. [ ] /h@xmath2 run seems to be a key discriminant for shocks .",
    "fabry - perot observations of these 3 lines for brighter halos , such as ngc 5775 , are now feasible and would provide much more information on the importance of secondary ionizing sources with local morphology and height .",
    "it is important to emphasize that shocks are not the only possible secondary source .",
    "other sources such as tmls , x - rays , and ionization by cosmic rays may contribute as well .",
    "another scenario that we consider is a pure photoionization model with an increasing temperature with @xmath3 . by making a few reasonably valid assumptions ,",
    "the run of gas temperature vs. @xmath3 has been determined in each of the four galaxies .",
    "we find that an increase in temperature with @xmath3 can explain the general trend of an increase in the ratios of forbidden lines to balmer lines with @xmath3 , including an increase in [ ] /h@xmath2 and the constancy of [ ] / [ ] . by establishing the run of gas temperature , constraints on ionization fractions of sulfur , oxygen , and hydrogen",
    "could then be established .",
    "the [ ] /h@xmath2 ratios in ngc 5775 and ugc 10288 generally indicate an exceptionally high ionization fraction of o@xmath4 , that invalidates the assumption that n@xmath72 and h@xmath72 have equal ionization fractions , indicating that the line ratios can not be explained by a temperature increase alone .",

    "<S> deep long - slit spectra of the diffuse ionized gas halos of the edge - on spiral galaxies ngc 4302 and ugc 10288 are presented . </S>",
    "<S> emission lines are detected up to about @xmath0 kpc in ngc 4302 , and to nearly @xmath1 kpc on the north side of ugc 10288 . </S>",
    "<S> for both galaxies , the line ratios [ ] /h@xmath2 and [ ] /h@xmath2 increase with @xmath3 in accordance with dilute photo - ionization models . </S>",
    "<S> runs of [ ] / [ ] , and for ugc 10288 , the run of [ ] /h@xmath2 , however , are not explained by the models . </S>",
    "<S> scale height determinations of their dig halos are generally lower than those of galaxies with more prominent extraplanar dig features .    these data , along with previously presented data for ngc 5775 and ngc 891 , are used to address the issue of how dig halos are energized . </S>",
    "<S> composite photo - ionization / shock models are generally better at explaining runs of line ratios in these galaxies than photoionization models alone . </S>",
    "<S> models of line ratios in ngc 5775 require a greater contribution from shocks for filamentary regions than for non - filamentary regions to explain the run of [ ] /h@xmath2 . in either case , </S>",
    "<S> the [ ] / [ ] ratio is not well fit by the models . </S>",
    "<S> composite models for ugc 10288 are successful at reproducing the run of [ ] / [ ] for all but the the highest values of [ ] /h@xmath2 ; however , the run of [ ] /h@xmath2 vs. [ ] /h@xmath2 does not show any discernible trend , making it difficult to determine whether or not shocks contribute to the layer s maintenance .    </S>",
    "<S> we also examine whether the data can be explained simply by an increase in temperature with @xmath3 in a pure photo - ionization model without a secondary source of ionization . </S>",
    "<S> runs of [ ] /h@xmath2 , [ ] /h@xmath2 , and [ ] / [ ] in each of the four galaxies are consistent with such an increase . however , the runs of [ ] /h@xmath2 vs. @xmath3 in ngc 5775 and ugc 10288 require unusually high ionization fractions of o@xmath4 that can not be explained without invoking a secondary ionization source or at the very least a much higher temperature for the [ ] -emitting component than for the [ ] - and [ ] -emitting component . </S>",
    "<S> an increase in temperature with @xmath3 is generally more successful at explaining the [ ] /h@xmath2 run in ngc 891 , with the ionization fraction of o@xmath4 remaining relatively low and nearly constant with @xmath3 . </S>"
