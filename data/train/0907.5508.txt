    "the study of transverse spin and momentum effects of the nucleon have started significantly later than the longitudinal case , mainly since there was a prejudice that transverse spin is small or irrelevant for ultra - relativistic particles , or , at least in hard reactions .",
    "the large single - spin asymmetries in pion production from the interaction of a transversely polarized 200 gev protons on a liquid target first reported by the fermilab e704 collaboration  @xcite ( and today confirmed at higher energies by the rhic experiments ) were not understood but believed to be a tail of low - energy phenomena . during the nineties both the experimental and the theoretical progress allowed to better spot the relevance of transverse spin and momentum effects for a deeper understanding of the nucleon structure . as a consequence , at that time several new experiments ( hermes at desy , compass at cern , the rhic experiments at bnl ) were proposed ; since that , the activity in the field is continuously growing , both theoretically and experimentally , giving a more and more complete picture .",
    "it is now well established that to fully specify the quark structure of the nucleon at the twist - two level , the transversity distributions @xmath2 have to be added to the unpolarised distributions @xmath3 and the helicity distributions @xmath4 .",
    "the transversity pdf s give the probability that the quark spins are aligned parallel or antiparallel to the spin of a transversely polarised nucleon .",
    "they are difficult to measure , since they are chirally odd and need to be coupled to a chirally odd partner .",
    "in particular , they can not be measured in inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) . in hadron colliders ( or with hadronic beams ) they can be measured looking at the drell - yan processes as proposed by the rhic experiments  @xcite for transversely polarized protons on proton scattering and by gsi experiments  @xcite with hard polarised proton anti - proton scattering .",
    "they can also be measured in semi - inclusive dis ( sidis ) of leptons on transversely polarised nucleons in which final state hadrons are also detected . to access the transversity pdf in sidis",
    ", one has to measure the quark polarisation , i.e. to use the so - called quark polarimetry. different techniques have been proposed in so far .",
    "three of them are presently used in compass , namely :    * measurement of the single - spin asymmetries ( ssa ) in the azimuthal distribution of the final state hadrons ( the so - called collins asymmetry ) ; * measurement of the polarisation of final state hyperons ( the so - called @xmath5 polarimetry ) ; * measurement of the ssa in the azimuthal distribution of the plane containing the final state hadron pairs ( the so - called two - hadron asymmetry ) ;    in this contribution the results obtained by compass with the first two methods will be given while the results obtained with the last of the three polarimeters is presented in  @xcite .",
    "the collins asymmetry , is due to the combined effect of @xmath6 and the chiral - odd collins fragmentation function @xmath7 , which describes the spin - dependent part of the hadronization of a transversely polarized quark into a hadron with transverse momentum @xmath8 . at leading order",
    ", the collins mechanism  @xcite leads to a modulation in the azimuthal distribution of the produced hadrons given by : @xmath9 where @xmath10 contains the apparatus efficiency and acceptance , @xmath11 is the target polarization , @xmath12 is the spin transfer coefficient and @xmath13 is the fraction of polarizable nucleons in the target ; @xmath14 is the collins angle , with @xmath15 the hadron azimuthal angle , @xmath16 the final azimuthal angle of the quark spin and @xmath17 the azimuthal angle of the nucleon spin in the @xmath18 system .",
    "finally @xmath19 is the collins asymmetry .",
    "another way to access transversity is by measuring the transverse @xmath5 and @xmath20 polarization in the reaction @xmath21 . if the struck quark fragments into a @xmath5 hyperon in this reaction , the corresponding polarization is given by : @xmath22 where the t - axis for the measurement of the polarization is given by the polarization vector of the struck quark . in this case",
    "the transversity distributions appear coupled to the chiral - odd part of the @xmath5 fragmentation functions @xmath23 , which are so far completely unknown .",
    "another important aspect under study in this field is the role of the quark intrinsic transverse momentum and the connection with the spin for the description of the nucleon structure .",
    "the transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) distribution functions ( pdf ) and fragmentation functions ( ff ) are today considered an important ingredient in the structure of the nucleon .",
    "the sidis cross - section in one - photon exchange approximation contains eight tmd pdf , three of which survive upon integration over the transverse momenta .",
    "some of these tmd distributions can be extracted in sidis looking at the azimuthal distributions of the final state hadrons .",
    "this is particularly true for the so - called sivers asymmetry , which is , together with the collins asymmetry , presently the most studied . through the sivers asymmetry it is possible to access the sivers pdf , which takes into account a possible deformation in the distribution of the quark intrinsic transverse momentum in a transversely polarised nucleon .",
    "particularly interesting is also the so called boer - mulders function and the compass efforts to access it are described in  @xcite .",
    "measuring sidis on a transversely polarized target allows the collins and the sivers effects to be disentangled .",
    "the sivers asymmetry can be written as : @xmath24 with a modulation expressed in terms of the sivers angle @xmath25 . since in this case",
    "the unpolarized fragmentation functions are known , the measurement of the sivers asymmetry for both positive and negative produced hadrons allows a direct extraction of the sivers functions , if the measured asymmetry are different from zero , while a zero result for an isoscalar target like the @xmath0lid used in compass can come both from a vanishing sivers function or from a cancellation between @xmath26 and @xmath27 quark contributions .",
    "the compass experiment has been set up at the cern sps m2 beam line .",
    "it combines high rate beams with a modern two stage magnetic spectrometer@xcite .",
    "+    r0.60        both stages are equipped with tracking devices covering the full acceptance , with e.m . and hadronic calorimetry and muon identification via filtering through thick absorbers . in the first stage a rich detector",
    "is also installed , allowing the identification of charged hadrons up to 50 gev .",
    "detectors , electronics and data acquisition system are able to handle beam rates up to 10@xmath28 muons / s . the triggering system and the tracking system of compass",
    "have been designed to stand the associated rate of secondaries , and use state - of - the - art detectors .",
    "also , fast front - end electronics , multi - buffering , and a large and fast storage of events are essential .",
    "compass has collected data with a 160 gev positive muon beam impinging on a polarized solid target .",
    "the beam is naturally polarized by the @xmath29decay mechanism , and the beam polarization is estimated to be @xmath30 with a @xmath31 relative error .",
    "the beam intensity is @xmath32 muons per spill .    up to 2004 compass",
    "has used the polarized target system of the smc experiment , which allows for two oppositely polarized target cells , 60  cm long each .",
    "the pt magnet can provide both a solenoid field ( 2.5 t ) , to hold the longitudinal ( with respect to the beam direction ) polarization , and a dipole field ( 0.5 t ) , needed for adiabatic spin rotation and for holding the transverse polarization . in 2006",
    "the installation of a new pt magnet , with an increased inner bore radius matching the full acceptance of the spectrometer ( 180 mrad ) , was performed .    up to 2006",
    "the experiment has used @xmath0lid as deuteron target because its favorable dilution factor of @xmath330.4 , particularly important for the measurement of . in 2007",
    "an ammonia nh@xmath1 target has been used as proton target . moreover ,",
    "the target material has been distributed in three cells , with a length of 30 cm for the outer cells and 60 cm for the inner one . in this case",
    "the outer cells have the same orientation of the polarization , opposite to the central one .",
    "polarizations of 50% and 90% have been reached , respectively for the two target materials .",
    "r0.60        the event selection requires standard dis cuts , i.e. @xmath34 , mass of the final hadronic state @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and the detection of at least one hadron in the final state . for the detected hadrons it is also required that :    * the fraction of the virtual photon energy carried is @xmath37 to select hadrons from the current fragmentation region ; * @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the hadron transverse momentum with respect to the virtual photon direction ) for a better determination of the azimuthal angle @xmath15 .",
    "the asymmetries have been calculated as a function of @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath39 for positive and negative hadrons respectively .",
    "both the resulting collins and sivers asymmetries from the whole deuteron data turned out to be small and compatible with zero  @xcite ( a trend that is also shown by the identified hadron results  @xcite ) , a result which was interpreted as a cancellation between the contribution of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks , for the isoscalar deuteron target . the new results for the proton target are shown in fig .",
    "[ resultscoll ] for the collins asymmetries and in fig .",
    "[ resultssiv ] for the sivers asymmetries , together with the prediction from  @xcite , based on the global analysis of the hermes proton data , compass deuteron data and belle @xmath42 data for collins and on the hermes proton data and compass deuteron data for sivers .",
    "collins asymmetries as a function of @xmath40 are small , compatible with zero , up to @xmath43 , while in the last points a signal appears , and the asymmetries increas up to 10% with opposite sign for the positive ( upper row ) and negative ( lower row ) .",
    "the trend is in good agreement with what observed by hermes  @xcite . at variance",
    "the sivers asymmetries are small and compatible with zero over the full @xmath40 range and for both positive and negative hadrons ; in this case the compatibility with hermes results is fine for negative hadrons but is marginal , if any , for positive hadrons .",
    "the origin of the disagreement , needs to be understood  @xcite and will be an interesting issue for the near future .    in fig .",
    "[ resultslambda ] the measured transverse @xmath5 and @xmath20 polarizations are shown as a function of @xmath40 .",
    "the result is statistically compatible with zero , over the full range , and this may come both from the relatively low-@xmath40 region sampled , or by the fact that most of the statistics comes from a region with @xmath44 , where @xmath45 may be small .",
