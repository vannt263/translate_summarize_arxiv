    "sources of neutrons are currently used to excite nuclei in an unknown sample of material in order to determine its elemental composition .",
    "the technique is called neutron activation analysis , where neutrons are incident on target nuclei and a unique spectrum of gamma rays are emitted for each element that is present in the sample  @xcite . in this technique ,",
    "measurements are made of emitted gamma rays that are either emitted almost instantaneously ( prompt gamma - ray ) , or , that are delayed .",
    "the prompt gamma - rays that are emitted almost instantaneously come from a compound nucleus that is formed when the neutron is captured by the target nucleus in the sample .",
    "the technique is called prompt gamma - ray neutron activation analysis ( pgnaa ) .",
    "when delayed gamma rays are measured , they are emitted by the decay of a radioactive intermediate state formed by the neutron irradiation . in this case , the technique is called delayed gamma - ray neutron activation analysis ( dgnaa ) . in both cases ,",
    "analysis of the composite emitted gamma ray spectrum often allows a precise determination of the elemental content of the sample  @xcite .",
    "a critical component in this type of detection is the source of neutrons .",
    "ideally , we would want a narrow beam of neutrons that can be directed at the sample so that the damaging effects of neutron radiation are limited to a small solid angle .",
    "a reaction that is commonly used for neutron production is the collision of deuterium with tritium  @xcite , @xmath3 however , with unpolarized deuterium and tritium this reaction generally produces an isotropic distribution of emitted neutrons , as opposed to the narrow beam mentioned above .",
    "if the deuterium and tritium nuclei were spin polarized before collision , then the symmetry of the collision , @xmath4 , would be reduced , and we would expect that there may be preferential directions for the emitted neutrons .",
    "quantum mechanical calculations of this collision process are quite complicated  @xcite . however , it is possible to use a considerably simpler approach to analyze some aspects of the kinematics of the spin - polarized deuterium and spin - polarized tritium collision .",
    "we use conservation of four - vector momentum and conservation of intrinsic spin tensor , within the context of special relativity , to investigate the kinematics of this collision .",
    "this reaction in eq.([d_t_reaction ] ) has the advantage that it has a large cross section , which peaks at 5 b  @xcite for a deuterium energy of 107 kev .",
    "it is believed that at low - energy the reaction , t(d , n)@xmath5 , proceeds via a short - lived intermediate resonant state of @xmath6 with a spin angular momentum @xmath7 , and that this state quickly decays into a neutron and a @xmath5 nucleus . at low energies",
    ", the reaction proceeds via zero orbital angular momentum , @xmath8 , so that the total spin @xmath7 must arise from intrinsic spin of the reactants  @xcite .",
    "therefore , at low energies , the deuterium nuclear spin @xmath9 , and tritium nuclear spin , @xmath10 , must be aligned to produce a total angular momentum @xmath7 in the initial state .",
    "the products of the reaction are a neutron , with nuclear spin @xmath11 , and @xmath5 which has nuclear spin @xmath12 .",
    "the total intrinsic spin of the product state ( helium and neutron ) is @xmath13 , so the rest of the angular momentum , the quantity @xmath14 , must be carried off as orbital angular momentum of the product state .",
    "alternatively , there is also some small amplitude for the reaction to proceed , with zero orbital angular momentum , when the deuterium and tritium spins are anti - aligned . in this case",
    ", there is zero orbital angular momentum carried off by the products .",
    "we consider this latter case in the work below .",
    "the formalism we use was initially applied by j. l. synge to discuss elastic collisions ( without transmutation of mass ) of particles having intrinsic spin  @xcite . here",
    ", we use synge s formalism to analyze the fundamentally inelastic collision , @xmath4 , when the reactants have a definite state of spin , in the sense of special relativity , where spin is represented as a four - tensor . the treatment we give below assumes that the deuterium has a zero impact parameter on the tritium , and",
    "therefore this limits our analysis to the case where the spin of deuterium and tritium are anti - aligned , i.e. , the spins are pointing in opposite directions .",
    "unfortunately , the condition of zero impact parameter is not easily relaxed because of complications in special relativity associated with the speed of propagation of interactions and the requirement of relativistic invariance  @xcite .",
    "as described above , at low energies , the zero impact parameter ( zero orbital angular momentum in initial state ) is probably the most important in the collision process since the reaction @xmath4 will only occur when the deuterium and tritium are in close spatial proximity , due to the short range nature of the nuclear forces .",
    "therefore , our goal here is to analyze the dependence of the velocity components ( angular dependence ) of the emitted neutron and helium nuclei , on the initial conditions , which are specified by initial velocity and initial spin orientation for deuterium and tritium .",
    "we apply the conservation of four momentum and conservation of intrinsic spin four - tensor .",
    "the total four momentum before the collision is equal to the total four momentum after the collision @xmath15 where the superscripts @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 label the four momentum vectors for deuterium , tritium , neutron , and helium , respectively .",
    "the subscript @xmath20 labels the space - time components of the four - vector .",
    "we follow the convention used by synge and take the fourth component to be imaginary , thereby omitting the need to explicitly introduce a metric tensor for space - time .",
    "so the momentum four - vector has the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 .",
    "greek indices take values @xmath23 , and latin indices always take values @xmath20 .",
    "we use the convention that repeated indices are summed over their respective ranges . here , @xmath24 are the ordinary three velocity components . equation  ( [ four_vector_conservation ] ) is a conservation law that is valid in any inertial frame of reference . for our purposes , we assume that the laboratory frame is an inertial frame .",
    "the conservation of four momentum leads to four equations .",
    "in four dimensional space - time , the total angular momentum is an antisymmetric second rank tensor , @xmath25 , with six independent components , for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the orbital angular momentum and @xmath28 is the spin angular momentum  @xcite .",
    "the spin is represented by a four tensor because in four dimensions ( space - time ) there is no four - vector ( of angular momentum ) that is dual to the tensor @xmath29 .    as discussed above",
    ", we assume that in the laboratory frame of reference the impact parameter for deuterium on tritium is zero , so there is zero orbital angular momentum in the collision , @xmath30 . in what follows ,",
    "we drop the superscript and we use @xmath29 to denote the intrinsic spin four - tensor , @xmath28 .    for a particle that is not experiencing any forces , the intrinsic spin four - tensor",
    "is conserved along the particle s world line  @xcite .",
    "when a collision occurs at a space - time point , the sum of the intrinsic spin four - tensors before the collision must be equal to the sum of these tensors after the collision , since the particles do not experience forces before or after the collision .",
    "we assume that the range of forces between particles is negligible , so that we take the collision to occur at a point .",
    "the intrinsic spin four - tensor can be expressed in terms of the particle s four velocity , @xmath31 and a unit spin four - vector , @xmath32 , according to  @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the magnitude of the intrinsic spin , the four - velocity satisfies @xmath35 and the unit spin four - vector satisfies , @xmath36 the levi - civita symbol , @xmath37 , is antisymmetric with respect to interchange of adjacent indices , it satisfies @xmath38 and has value -1 for odd permutations of its argument , so that @xmath39 the intrinsic spin four - tensor has the following frame - independent invariant , @xmath40 furthermore , the intrinsic spin four - tensor is orthogonal to the four velocity @xmath41 by virtue of its construction in eq .",

    "we consider the collision , @xmath4 where the initial conditions are such that both the deuterium and tritium spins are anti - aligned .",

    "at least second order in the velocities must be kept to allow for the transmutation of mass , i.e. , inelastic collision process .",
    "we find that there are two solutions to these ten equations , and each solution has a unique velocity for the neutron and for the @xmath0he nucleus .",
    "the two solutions , which we call solution 1 and solution 2 , are related by reflection in the @xmath92 plane , which is perpendicular to the deuterium spin , @xmath71 , and contains the deuterium velocity vector , @xmath93 .",

    "the numerical data used in our calculations is given in table i.    at the maximum cross section , where the deuteron kinetic energy is 107 kev , the angle of the neutron is @xmath95 degrees and the angle of the helium is @xmath96 degrees .",
    "within the context of special relativity , we have applied the conservation of four momentum and the conservation of intrinsic spin to a collision of deuterium with a stationary tritium atom , in the laboratory frame of reference .",
    "we have assumed that the deuterium and tritium nuclei have spins that are anti - aligned and have zero impact parameter , corresponding to zero orbital angular momentum in the initial state .",
    "we have verified , as intuitively expected , that there are unique ( classical ) solutions for neutron ( and helium ) velocities , i.e. , there are unique directions for the emitted neutron and helium .",
    "specifically , for a given energy of incident deuteron , there are two solutions that are related by reflection symmetry , see the above discussion .",
    "we have obtained the angular dependence of the emitted neutron and helium as a function of the incident deuterium kinetic energy .",

    ".[constantvalues]numerical data taken from refs.@xcite and @xcite [ cols= \" < ,",
    "< , < \" , ]     from our classical relativistic analysis , it seems clear that we could in principle relax the constraint of zero impact parameter , so that we could impose some amount of orbital angular momentum for the deuterium and helium . within a classical context ( as opposed to a quantum calculation ) the amount of orbital angular momentum imposed in the initial conditions is arbitrary and is a continuous quantity ( not a discrete quantity , as in quantum calculations)related to the impact parameter . as described earlier , assuming non - zero angular momentum in the initial state would allow us to treat the case where the deuterium and tritium spins are aligned , which is presumably the more important case .",
    "as described earlier , in such as case , we will have orbital angular momentum appear in the products of the collision ( neutron and helium ) .",
    "the continuum of possible angular momentum in the initial state would then lead to a continuum of angular momentum in the possible final ( product ) states .",
    "so the neutrons would not have a unqiue direction , but instead , they would have a distribution of possible velocities .",
