    "quantum phase transitions , which occur when a driving parameter in the hamiltonian of the system changes across a critical point , play a central role in condensed matter physics  @xcite . while most quantum phase transitions can be characterized by symmetry breaking , there is also an exception that can only be witnessed by topological order ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . signatures of topological order in many - body quantum systems can characterize a topological quantum phase transition and include , e.g. , the existence of excitations obeying fractional statistics ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , ground - state degeneracy related to the topology of the system ( instead of the symmetry ) ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and topological entanglement entropy  @xcite . in particular , the spectral chern number  @xcite serves as a topological number for characterizing a two - dimensional ( 2d ) system of noninteracting ( or weakly interacting ) fermions with an energy gap . without closing the gap , energy spectra with different chern numbers",

    "the insulator phase , as kitaev has shown by using perturbation theory @xcite , is equivalent to a toric code model @xcite .",

    "we show that the third directional derivative of the ground - state energy is discontinuous at each point on the critical line separating the abelian and non - abelian phases , while its first and second directional derivatives are continuous at this point .",
    "this implies that the topological quantum phase transition is continuous in this extended kitaev model .",
    "moreover , at this critical point , we also study the nonanalyticity of the entanglement ( i.e. , the von neumann entropy ) between two nearest - neighbor spins and the rest of the spins in the system .",
    "we find that the second directional derivative of the von neumann entropy is closely related to the third directional derivative of the ground - state energy and it is also discontinuous at the critical point .",

    "<S> we study the quantum phase transition between abelian and non - abelian phases in an extended kitaev spin model on the honeycomb lattice , where the periodic boundary condition is applied by placing the lattice on a torus . </S>",
    "<S> our analytical results show that this spin model exhibits a continuous quantum phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> also , we reveal the relationship between bipartite entanglement and the ground - state energy . </S>",
    "<S> our approach directly shows that both the entanglement and the ground - state energy can be used to characterize the topological quantum phase transition in the extended kitaev spin model . </S>"
