    "the standard @xmath11 model @xcite of the strong and electroweak interactions has several features for which a simple and satisfactory theoretical explanation is lacking .",
    "these include the origin of the masses of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 bosons , and the pattern of the couplings of these bosons to quarks and leptons  a pattern which involves several unexplained parameters and violation of symmetries such as parity and possibly cp conjugation .",
    "experiments which study the production and decay of one or more electroweak gauge bosons might provide clues that will enable us to better understand these puzzling features of the standard model . in this paper we will present some intriguing predictions of the standard model for correlations between the final state particles in the production of pairs of electroweak bosons in hadron - hadron collisions . these correlations produce asymmetries in the predicted cross sections that are very sensitive to the details of the couplings of the gauge bosons to quarks and in particular to the parity - violating nature of these couplings .",
    "while these asymmetries are predicted to be rather small , their measurement would provide an elegant test of the standard model , and deviations from these predictions might provide clues to a more fundamental structure which might underlie the standard model .",
    "the parity - violating asymmetries presented in this paper owe their existence to a quantum mechanical interference between amplitudes involving the exchange of gluons and electroweak bosons in @xmath14 annihilation .",
    "this phenomenon of `` chromo - electroweak interference '' is exemplified by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ twototwofig ] .",
    "it is similar in nature to the interference @xcite between a virtual photon and a virtual @xmath4 which gives rise for example to the well known asymmetry @xcite in @xmath15 , to the parity - violating asymmetry in the scattering of polarized electrons from nuclei @xcite , or to the parity - violation observed in atomic systems @xcite . unlike electroweak interference between a photon and a @xmath4 , which have the same quantum numbers , chromo - electroweak interference between a gluon and an electroweak boson , which have different color and flavor quantum numbers , can occur only if the gluon and the electroweak boson are exchanged in different channels as shown in fig .",
    "[ twototwofig ] .",
    "an interference between the two diagrams in this figure is interesting because the magnitude of its contribution to the cross section might be expected to lie in between that of the strong and the weak exchange diagrams taken separately : thus if the weak contribution were too small to be observed , the interference might provide the only observable signature of the weak exchange .",
    "an extremely interesting possibility arises if at least one of the quarks is polarized and the electroweak boson is a @xmath12 or a @xmath4 , both of which couple asymmetrically to left- and right - handed fermions : the interference contributions can then contain terms that are odd under parity , i.e. , that are proportional to invariants such as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a spin and @xmath18 a momentum .",
    "this possibility has been exploited @xcite to make predictions for parity - violating signatures in inclusive hadron production at large @xmath19 in polarized hadron - hadron scattering .",
    "unfortunately , experiments with polarized beams are difficult to perform except at low energies at which the weak couplings are very small , and the prospects for observing these asymmetries do not appear to be very promising .",
    "the prospects for observing chromo - electroweak interference effects might be considerably better at energies above the threshold for producing @xmath12 and @xmath13 bosons . at these energies the weak couplings are in fact only an order of magnitude smaller than the strong interaction coupling .",
    "in addition , the cross sections for observing multiparticle final states including jets of hadrons at large @xmath19 become appreciable at these energies , and this makes it possible to avoid the need for observing polarizations in order to have parity violation . it was pointed out in @xcite that if for example a @xmath12 boson were radiated off one of the quarks lines in fig.[twototwofig ] , the interference cross section would be parity - violating even if all particles involved were unpolarized . with two incoming particles and three particles in the final state , it becomes possible to construct a non - vanishing parity - odd invariant @xmath20 from the momenta @xmath21 of the five particles involved , four of which can be chosen to be linearly independent . in @xcite ,",
    "it was shown that this interference gave rise to parity - violating asymmetries of order 0.01 pb in the process @xmath22 jets at energies @xmath23 1 tev .",
    "the asymmetry is largest when the electroweak boson in fig.[twototwofig ] and the additional radiated @xmath12 are on - shell .",
    "observation of this asymmetry does not require that the flavors of the jets be determined  only that their momenta be determined with sufficient accuracy to select pairs of jets with the invariant mass of the pair equal to that of a @xmath12 or a @xmath13 within a few gev .",
    "asymmetries with a similar origin have been studied @xcite in @xmath24 annihilation , and an application to the process @xmath25 has recently been discussed in @xcite .",
    "similar parity - violating asymmetries occur in the process hadron + hadron @xmath26 3 jets @xcite : they originate from diagrams in which the electroweak boson @xmath7 is replaced by a gluon ; they are considerably larger than the asymmetries in @xmath7 + 2 jet production discussed in this paper , but may not be easy to detect above the qcd 3-jet background .    in @xcite ,",
    "the radiated boson was taken to be a @xmath27 and the boson which decayed to 2 jets a @xmath4 .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a detailed derivation and discussion of the results which were summarized in @xcite , and to extend these results to all possible combinations of pairs of electroweak bosons , including real photons , that appear to be of phenomenological interest .",
    "we also consider the more general process in which the final state contains a lepton pair which comes from the decay of an on - shell @xmath3 or @xmath4 , and a @xmath14 pair which comes from the decay of a second on - shell @xmath12 or @xmath13 . in section",
    "ii , we single out the dominant amplitudes that are expected to contribute to chromo - electroweak interference , and present compact expressions for amplitudes and interference cross sections @xcite derived using the powerful and elegant helicity - amplitude techniques @xcite that have recently gained popularity . in section iii",
    "we first define parity - violating asymmetries in a way that depends only on the momenta of the jet partons involved and not on their internal quantum numbers . we then present numerical predictions for these asymmetries , both at the parton and at the hadron levels , first for @xmath7 + 2 jet final states where @xmath28 , @xmath4 or a real photon , and then for @xmath6 + 2 jet final states in which the lepton pair comes from the decay of an on - shell @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "we also discuss the problem of observing parity - violating asymmetries above a background @xcite that is expected to be as much as two orders of magnitude larger than the signal .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section iv , and some details pertaining to the calculation of the helicity amplitudes and cross sections are presented in the appendixes .",

    "however if @xmath48 is on shell as can happen in @xmath49 the cross section is enhanced by a factor @xmath50 .",
    "thus , one might expect the pair - production of on - shell electroweak bosons to produce an easily observable resonance peak above the qcd background in the process ( [ processeq ] ) .",

    "there are many more qcd diagrams in fig .",
    "[ vjjdiags ] than electroweak diagrams in fig .",

    "in particular , gluons can contribute to the qcd cross section , as can various combinations of quarks and antiquarks , while on - shell electroweak - boson pair production can only occur via @xmath51 annihilation .",
    "in addition , the `` abelian '' and `` non - abelian '' amplitudes in fig .  [ weakdiags ] tend to contribute with opposite signs since the renormalizability of the theory requires such cancellations in the tree amplitudes at high energies .    in ref .",

    "once again , the electroweak contributions of fig .  [ weakdiags ] will be very small unless @xmath44 is almost on shell when its propagator will behave like @xmath53 comparing this with the propagator of the gluon in fig .",
    "[ vjjdiags]a which we can assume has roughly the same momentum @xmath54 we see that the qcd background , the interference contribution , and the electroweak pair - production cross sections are nominally of relative magnitudes @xmath55 with @xmath56 .",
    "the interference contributions might be expected to be suppressed on account of the following factors : ( i ) like the @xmath57 pair production cross section , there are many fewer initial states than contribute to the qcd background .",
    "( ii ) correlations between initial and final parton colors , flavors and helicities further restrict the subprocesses that can receive interference contributions .",
    "( iii ) gauge cancellations between the abelian and non - abelian diagrams in fig .",
    "[ weakdiags ] will also tend to suppress the interference contributions .",
    "there is one more factor that might , at first sight , actually seem to make the interference terms vanish , and that is the relative factor of @xmath58 between eqs .",
    "( [ weakpropeq ] ) and ( [ gluonpropeq ] ) when @xmath44 is exactly on shell : since the diagrams in figs .",
    "[ vjjdiags]a and [ weakdiags ] have the same number of vertices and propagators , the amplitudes would indeed be @xmath59 out of phase were it not for spinorial factors in the amplitudes that supply a compensating factor of @xmath58 that comes from spinor traces such as @xmath60 = 4i\\epsilon_{\\mu\\nu\\lambda\\sigma}k^\\mu_1k^\\nu_2 k^\\lambda_3k^\\sigma_4\\ ; , \\label{traceeq}\\ ] ] in the spin - averaged cross section .",
    "in fact , the interference cross sections presented in sec .",

    "we will show that , in contrast to the electroweak pair production cross section which is parity conserving , the interference terms give rise to parity - violating asymmetries which might make them observable in spite of the fact that the magnitudes of the interference cross sections ( like the electroweak pair production cross sections ) are much smaller than the qcd background .",
    "figure  [ lljjdiags ] shows the three electroweak amplitudes @xmath61 which produce an on - shell boson @xmath62 shown decaying to a lepton - antilepton pair with invariant mass @xmath63 , and an on - shell boson @xmath44 which decays to a quark - antiquark pair with invariant mass @xmath64 .",
    "the quark with momentum @xmath65 and the antiquark with momentum @xmath66 are to be crossed to the initial state where they represent the annihilating antiquark and quark respectively .",
    "the figure also shows the four qcd amplitudes @xmath67 which are capable of interfering with @xmath61 .",
    "note that , when the particles 1 and 2 are crossed to the initial state , the gluon in amplitudes @xmath67 has space - like momentum : as in fig .",
    "[ twototwofig ] , this is necessary in order that flavor and color quantum numbers of the initial and final quarks in @xmath61 be the same as in @xmath67 .",
    "we will assume that all quarks are massless .",
    "helicity , then , is conserved at each interaction vertex since the electroweak bosons and the gluons are vector bosons .",
    "thus the helicities of the initial and final quarks are the same in the interference , as are the helicities of the antiquarks .",
    "relative to the electroweak pair - production cross section . ]",
    "it is important to remember that the feynman rules require a relative minus sign due to fermi statistics between the amplitudes @xmath61 and @xmath67 since the quark lines differ by the interchange of a pair of labels .",
    "this can also be seen by noting that the electroweak pair - production cross section @xmath68 is got from a cut - diagram with two quark loops , while the interference @xmath69 is got from a cut - diagram which has a single quark loop .",
    "helicity decomposition techniques@xcite have proven to be extremely useful in evaluating tree diagram amplitudes and cross sections .",
    "if all external particles in a diagram are massless fermions and all interactions are mediated by vector bosons , the allowed combinations of helicities of the external particles are restricted since helicity is conserved at each interaction vertex along any fermion line . by judiciously choosing the phases of the wavefunctions of the external particles , one can obtain very compact expressions for the independent helicity amplitudes .",
    "a spin - averaged cross section can then be obtained by squaring these compact expressions and summing over the allowed helicity combinations . in practice , this procedure yields , with considerably less calculational effort , expressions for cross sections that are more compact than those obtained by traditional trace - algebra techniques in which the spin - averaged cross sections are represented by traces of products of dirac - matrices .",
    "helicity amplitude techniques are also extremely useful in calculating amplitudes involving external massless vector bosons such as photons and gluons .",
