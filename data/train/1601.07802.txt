    "while quantum dynamics is in general very different from classical dynamics , for short times initially gaussian wave packets stay approximately gaussian and follow classical trajectories .",
    "this has been shown by hepp and heller using the fact that gaussian states stay exactly gaussian for harmonic hamiltonians , and taylor expanding more general hamiltonians up to second order around the centre of the wave packet @xcite ( see also @xcite for a review on the properties and dynamics of gaussian wave packets ) . as long as the wave packet stays well localized compared to the scale on which the higher order terms in the taylor expansion of the hamiltonian are negligible this is a good approximation .",
    "it is also the main ingredient of more powerful methods to approximate dynamics in the deep quantum regime such as the frozen gaussian propagator and the method of hybrid mechanics @xcite .",
    "there are many analogies between the wave nature of light and the quantum mechanical wave function .",
    "in particular , the propagation of light in wave guides in the paraxial approximation is described by a time - dependent schrdinger equation ( where the propagation direction acts as time ) .",
    "this has led to spectacular demonstrations of quantum dynamical effects , as well as to new applications in optics ( see , e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . in recent years",
    ", there has been a surge of interest in optical waveguides with gain and loss , mimicking non - hermitian , and in particular @xmath0-symmetric @xcite , quantum systems @xcite .",
    "it is an interesting question what might be the fate of initial gaussian wave packets in the limit of large locally approximately harmonic potentials in the spirit of hepp and heller . in @xcite",
    "this question has been investigated , and a new type of classical dynamics guiding the centers of gaussian wave packets has been derived . in this dynamics the changing shape of the wave packet couples back into the dynamics of the centre .",
    "that is , even in the limit where the beam width is completely negligible compared to the external potential and where the dynamics is accurately described by the gaussian approximation , there are many classical trajectories for a given set of initial position and momentum , depending on the width of the wave packet .",
    "here we review the approximation and give explicit equations of motion for the special case of a hamiltonian with complex potential , and investigate the resulting dynamics in an example of a @xmath0-symmetric multimode waveguide .",
    "the approximation accurately describes the propagation and effects such as the typical power oscillations in pt - symmetric systems if the potential is chosen large enough compared to the beam width associated to the ground state .",
    "we demonstrate how the shape of the beam affects the propagation , and how this might be used as a filtering device .",
    "for simplicity we consider the propagation of light in a two - dimensional waveguide where the ( complex ) refractive index @xmath1 is constant along the @xmath2-direction and varies along the @xmath3-direction .",
    "the results are straight forwardly generalised to higher dimensions and refractive indices that are modulated in @xmath2-direction as well .    in the paraxial approximation",
    "the propagation of the electric field amplitude @xmath4 is described by the schrdinger equation @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and @xmath7 is the wavelength , and where the effective potential @xmath8 is approximately given by the refractive index profile @xmath9 of the waveguide , where @xmath10 is the reference refractive index of the substrate . without loss of generality we use rescaled units with @xmath11 in what follows .",
    "we consider the propagation of an initial gaussian beam of the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the position of the center of the beam , @xmath14 , the expectation value of the quantum momentum operator , describes the angle of incidence , and @xmath15 encodes the shape of the beam .",
    "in particular it holds @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , and we demand @xmath18 such that the wave packet is normalisable .    in the spirit of hepp and heller we make a gaussian ansatz for the propagated beam @xmath19 with @xmath20 , @xmath21 . here",
    "@xmath22 denotes the norm , and @xmath23 is an additional phase .",
    "we taylor expand the potential around the center @xmath24 of the wave packet and equate terms of the same orders of @xmath25 to find the dynamical equations for the parameters @xcite @xmath26 here @xmath27 and @xmath28 denote the real and imaginary part of the ( negative ) refractive index , respectively .",

    "is governed by the third equation in ( [ eq : gaussian_approx ] ) .",
    "the remaining two equations describe the dynamics of the overall norm and an additional phase , and can be trivially integrated once the first three equations are solved . in the present paper",
    "we shall not be concerned with the dynamics of the phase @xmath36 .",
    "we can eliminate @xmath37 to derive a second order differential equation for the position of the wave packet center @xmath38 that couples to the dynamical equation for the width parameter @xmath35 , and both in turn determine the dynamics of the norm @xmath39 .",

    "this effect could be used to spatially separate gaussian beams with different widths . if the width parameter of the beam also has a non - vanishing real part , this leads to an additional shift in the momentum , which translates into the angle in optical applications . at the same time",
    "the overall norm is only changed linearly according to @xmath88 for short propagation distances .",
    "we have derived semiclassical equations of motion for gaussian beams propagating in waveguides in the paraxial approximation in the presence of gain and loss . in the absence of losses",
    "this leads to hamiltonian motion of the center with a time dependent width . in the presence of gain and/or loss",
    ", however , the width of the beam influences the central motion . we have demonstrated that this gaussian approximation can capture typical features of beam propagation in gain - loss wave guides such as power oscillations , and can accurately describe the propagation if the refractive index is well described by its taylor expansion up to second order on length scales given by the typical widths of the gaussian beam .",
    "finally we have demonstrated how the dependence on the width could be used as a filtering device .",
