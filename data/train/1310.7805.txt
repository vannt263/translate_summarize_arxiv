    "no tev from have been detected and upper limits on the integrated flux above 250 gev are @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "we notice that the lack of evidence for detectable tev emission from can be due to the strong absorption of these photons ( through @xmath14 absorption on ultraviolet ( uv ) stellar photons from the wr star ) or due to limited time of observation .",

    "produce and neutrinos . by normalizing our model with the emission of at its peak ( using agile data ) and considering the magic upper limits ( that we interpret in terms of a strong @xmath20 absorption on the stellar photons ) , the corresponding flux of he neutrinos is calculated and compared with the icecube sensitivity .    this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec2 ] the model for production of hadronic is described : in section  [ sec3 ] the spectra of and neutrinos produced in @xmath15 interactions are calculated ; the results are presented in section  [ sec4 ] .",
    "the discussions and conclusions are presented in sections [ sec5 ] and [ sec6 ] .",
    "the origin of he from microquasars can be interpreted within both leptonic and hadronic scenarios .",

    ", the leptonic scenario has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite . in particular , @xcite applied this picture to the agile observations of in flaring states , showing how a leptonic scenario can explain the spectral shape at gev energies as well as the hard x - ray emission at @xmath3100 kev observed during the transient activity .    by considering a hadronic picture , since protons are characterized by a longer cooling time than electrons",
    ", we can assume that protons are accelerated well above 10 tev .",
    "the detection of a periodic tev signal ( which could be evidence for production of tev photons in a binary system ) would provide additional information on the problem of distinguishing leptonic and hadronic contributions .",
    "if accelerated in the presence of a strong cooling photon background , electrons would possibly produce vhe by ic scattering . on the other hand",
    ", hadrons would produce vhe by interaction of a suitable gaseous target . after escaping from the jet , protons",
    "can interact both with the x - ray photon field from the accretion disk ( @xmath21 interaction ) as well as with the hadronic component of the stellar wind ( @xmath15 interaction ) . in both cases , a significant flux of tev and neutrinos",
    "are predicted : while the are absorbed ( depending on the energy ) , the neutrinos escape from the region with negligible absorption . the emerging flux of he neutrinos",
    "can significantly exceed the observed flux ( approximately @xmath22 times higher , where @xmath23 is the optical depth of @xmath14 absorption ) .",
    "for example in the case of the microquasar ls 5039 , the flux of he neutrinos can be as large as @xmath24 ( for energy greater than 1 tev ) , above the sensitivity threshold of experiments in the mediterranean sea @xcite .",
    "therefore the binary systems could have a high flux of he neutrinos , which can be detected by the current generation of detectors .",
    "hadronic models based on @xmath21 interactions require acceleration of protons in the inner jet up to the energies of @xmath25 ev in order to produce a significant flux of he and neutrinos . on the other hand , models based on @xmath15 interactions",
    "can explain the observed flux by requiring lower energies of accelerated protons .",
    "production of he neutrinos from @xmath21 interaction in have been discussed in @xcite : the expected number of neutrinos  assuming the icecube sensitivity  during 61 days is 0.02 , corresponding to a non - detectable flux .",
    "an alternative hadronic scenario for production of from was discussed in @xcite , within the jet - wind interaction model .",
    "they found that the constraints on the energetics of the system are physically reasonable : the required jet kinetic power is lower than the eddington accretion limit for the source , and the resulting spectral shape is consistent with the observed spectrum above 100 mev . in our model",
    "we assume that the energy budget in the jet is dominated by the kinetic energy of an _ e - p _ plasma and it contains a significant population of protons .",
    "these particles are accelerated along the jet propagation ( e.g via shock acceleration ) and can reach very high energies ; in the binary frame this energy is even higher ( multiplied by the lorentz factor of the jet ) . due to the slowly cooling of the protons in the jet ,",
    "their maximum energy will be likely limited by the size of acceleration region : the larmor radius ( @xmath26 ) of the protons should be contained in the acceleration region @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the jet radius and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the elementary charge .",
    "depending on the efficiency of acceleration , the magnetic field ( @xmath31 ) , and the jet radius ( @xmath28 ) , the proton maximum energy ( @xmath32 ) can be as large as 100 tev .",
    "however , the accelerated protons can escape from the jet at some distance from the compact object since the magnetic field gets weaker .",
    "in case this occurs in a binary system , the protons interact with the dense wind of the wr star , producing neutral and charged pions via inelastic hadronic scattering .",
    "the neutral pions subsequently decay in , while muon and electron neutrinos ( @xmath33 ) are produced by the decays of @xmath34 ( e.g. , @xmath35 ) .",
    "if we define @xmath36 as the luminosity of relativistic protons , the corresponding luminosity of is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the energy transfer efficiency from relativistic protons to secondary particles ( for simplicity it is assumed that the escape time of protons from the binary system is longer than the cooling time ) .",
    "similarly , expressing the acceleration power of protons in terms of the total jet power , @xmath39 , one finds the following relation between jet power and luminosity , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the acceleration efficiency and @xmath42 is the efficiency of production . assuming @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) , and a peak isotropic luminosity above 100 mev of @xmath45 , the corresponding jet power is @xmath46 , which is an order of magnitude lower than the eddington accretion limit for the system ( assuming that the compact object in is a black hole with a mass of @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the solar mass ) and it is consistent with the average bolometric luminosity of the hypersoft state , @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as demonstrated by @xcite , it is unlikely that the he have a coronal origin ( unless the corona is unrealistically extended ) : the observed emission is linked to the physics of the jet and created outside the photosphere ( at distances greater than @xmath50-@xmath51 cm from the compact object ) .",
    "observations of the source revealed a orbital modulation @xcite coherent with the orbital period ( @xmath52 hr ) .",
    "the folded emission above 100 mev is characterized by a sharp maximum in correspondence to the superior conjunction of the system ( compact object behind the wr star , with respect to the line of sight ) .",
    "the appear to be approximately in antiphase with the x - ray modulation , a fact that may be linked to the different physical origin of the two components .",
    "the modulated are produced only if the protons are confined in the binary system in time scales less than @xmath53 otherwise the protons will escape from the binary system .",
    "since the cooling time for @xmath15 interactions is @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , from the relation @xmath56 , the condition for modulation is satisfied only for densities ( @xmath57 ) larger than @xmath58 @xmath59 ( assuming @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) . accordingly",
    ", this condition is satisfied especially near superior conjunction because of an increase of the density along the orbit ( anisotropic wind ) or due to protons interacting with clumps ( regions where the density is significantly higher than average value ) @xcite . at other phases along the orbit",
    ", the density of the wind should be significantly lower and since this change of density causes the change of luminosity of produced , this results a modulation of signal .",
    "in the binary systems the production of ( both in leptonic and hadronic origin ) is accompanied by strong absorption of these photons . depending on both their energy and the site of he production ,",
    "the emitted can be absorbed by interactions with the x - ray photons from the corona / disk complex or with the uv photon field from the companion star .",
    "we discuss below the production of from @xmath15 interaction as well as the opacity of photon absorption .",
    "hadronic inelastic scattering , between high - energy protons ( accelerated in the jet ) with cold protons from the wr wind , is responsible for the production of secondary and neutrinos .",
    "the fluxes of produced particles are calculated using the analytical approximation derived in @xcite , obtained from numerical simulations of @xmath15 interaction with the publicly available code sibyll .",
    "the analytical formulae provide a very good description of the flux and energy distribution of secondaries for energies above 100 gev .",
    "the formula for also includes the contribution of @xmath62 meson decay , in addition to that of @xmath63 , with an overall accuracy of order a few percent .",
    "+ at energies below 0.1 tev and down to the rest energy of the @xmath64-meson , the fluxes of and neutrinos are modeled with delta function approximation as suggested by @xcite , namely the fluxes are given by : @xmath65 for both particle type @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) , @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . in eq .",

    "the produced can be absorbed by interactions with uv stellar photons from the companion star . in the calculations below ,",
    "we take into account this absorption by using the opacity averaged over the injection angles : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is energy of the companion star s photons , @xmath82 is the threshold of pair production , @xmath83 , @xmath84 is the energy of the , @xmath85 is the electron rest energy and @xmath86 is the cross section for photon - photon pair production @xcite .",
    "the distribution of stellar photons is assumed to have a blackbody spectrum peaking at the star s effective temperature ( @xmath87 ) : @xmath88 where @xmath89 and @xmath90 are the planck and boltzmann constants respectively , and @xmath91 is the radius of the companion star .",

    "[ abs ]    this absorption depends strongly on the geometry .",
    "it depends on the relative location of the source , the companion star , and the line of sight to the observer .",
    "we calculated the opacity , which depends on the distance from the companion star ( @xmath94 ) , by averaging over the injection angles .",

    "the vhe produced very close to star ( e.g. @xmath95 ) will be heavily attenuated ( @xmath98 for @xmath99 ) , and the observed spectrum of vhe photons would be hardened compared to its intrinsic shape .",
    "however this opacity will vary depending on the distance , for comparison , the opacity of gamma - photon interaction at distance @xmath97 is @xmath100 ( at 100 gev ) .",
    "it rapidly drops for higher energies , and the source becomes transparent for above 10 tev .",
    "it should be noted that a similar study of pair - production opacity along the orbit presented by @xcite found consistent results : the opacity peaks around 100 gev and drops at higher energies .",

    "accordingly , below we discuss different possibilities for the absorption in , assuming that gamma - photon interactions occur close ( strong absorption ) or far away from the companion star ( weak absorption ) .",
    "+ at the same time , since the cross section of @xmath14 interaction achieves its maximum at @xmath107 , the absorption of gev will be effectively in the x - ray photon field",
    ". however , since in our model the are produced farther from the compact object , where the density of x - ray photon field is low , these photons escape the region without significant absorbtion .",
    "accordingly , using the agile observations of flares , the limit on the power - law index of proton energy distribution can be derived .",
    "the resultant fits of the data for different initial proton energy distributions are shown in fig .",
    "as one can see , the minimum power - law index which can reproduce the observed data corresponds to @xmath2 ( blue solid line ) , since for lower power - law indices predicted flux of is larger than the data ( blue dashed line in fig .",

    "the dashed lines corresponds to the unabsorbed flux of , instead the corresponding absorbed spectra are depicted with solid lines . as one can see , in all cases the predicted unabsorbed flux of at tev energies is larger than the uls derived from magic observations .",
    "however , taking into account the absorption of , our model is in agreement with the observed data in mev / gev and tev energies .",
    "for example , in the case of a proton index of @xmath2 ( which is related to the highest flux ) , assuming that the are produced at the distance @xmath109 , the density of stellar photon field is so high that the absorbed spectrum is lower than the magic uls ( blue solid line in fig .",

    "+ neutrinos are produced together with the , but unlike the they escape from the region without any absorption . in fig .",
    "[ fg ]  ( b ) we show the resulting neutrino fluxes from corresponding to the models of fig .  [ fg ]  ( a ) .",
    "since the minimum power - law index obtained from the observations corresponds to @xmath2 , the predicted flux of neutrinos can be considered as a maximum flux during the activity of the microquasar ( this is shown with a filled area in fig .  [ fg ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "this predicted flux of he neutrinos is compared with the icecube sensitivities expected for different exposure times : two - month ( 61 days ) and one - year ( 365 days ) exposure time ( red and blue dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fg ]  ( b ) , respectively ) . the effective area for the 40-string configuration @xcite",
    "have been scaled to the 86-string configuration ( full string configuration ) .",
    "the maximum predicted flux of neutrinos is almost two order of magnitude less than the 61 day icecube sensitivity , in agreement with the absence of a detectable neutrino signal from from the current icecube observations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we can assume that relativistic particles inside the jet can be accelerated far above 100 tev , reaching pev energies ( supposing that is a galactic `` pevatron '' ) .",
    "accordingly , if the cut - off energy in the proton spectrum ( see eq .",
    "[ fin ] ) is at 10 pev , the predicted flux of he neutrinos is slightly lower than the icecube sensitivity for one - year exposure time ( solid blue line in fig .  [ fg ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "therefore , future detection of he neutrinos from is possible if the particles in the jet are accelerated up to ultra high energies .    in the previous discussion",
    "only the data from agile observations are used",
    ". however , the derived conclusions are valid also for the spectrum obtained by during a prolonged activity of the microquasar @xcite .",
    "the predicted flux of he neutrinos , related to the activity detected by , will be slightly lower than the ones presented in fig .",
    "[ fg ]  ( b ) , since the photon index for the average emission from above 100 mev is @xmath114 @xcite , instead of the value @xmath115 determined by agile in the range 100 mev - 1 gev .",
    "hadronic emission from , discussed and presented in the previous sections , requires an effective acceleration of hadrons ( protons ) in the jet of the microquasar .",
    "the total energy of the protons ( for @xmath2 ) corresponds to @xmath116 erg , assuming the number density of the wind to be @xmath117 @xmath59 .",
    "the kinetic power of protons in the jet ( @xmath118 ) would be @xmath119 , consistent with the hypersoft state bolometric luminosity .",

    "[ fg ]  ( b ) ) .",
    "furthermore , the minimum detectable neutrino flux for a neutrino point source with a generic @xmath16 spectrum , after one year of operation , is @xmath121 at 5 @xmath122 significance @xcite .",
    "we then obtain @xmath123 .",
    "this estimate shows that only a quite hard proton injection rate ( of index @xmath124 ) extending up to 10 pev can produce a detectable flux of he neutrinos from .",
    "the flux of he neutrinos depends , not only on the proton injection rate ( which may be time variable ) , but also on the duration of the he activity of the source .",
    "it is known that the microquasar emits only in specific x - ray conditions : namely , during bright soft x - ray spectral states coincident with _ minima _ of the hard x - ray light curve @xcite . in principle",
    ", these states could last several months @xcite or even longer , with a strong probability of emitting .",
    "these prolonged episodes of minimal hard x - ray emission ( and corresponding maximal soft x - ray emission ) might imply a significant increase of neutrino emission which can be detected by icecube under favorable conditions .",
    "interestingly , the hard x - ray light curve as detected by _ swift_/bat ( 15 - 50 kev ) ( see fig .  [ cyg_x3_bat ] ) shows such a prolonged activity .",
    "namely , with the gray region of the plot is indicated a prolonged period ( mjd : @xmath35374954136 , between 2006 and february 2007 ) in which is found to be most of the time ( @xmath370% ) in a soft state ( _ swift_/bat count rate @xmath125 @xmath11 ) .",
    "therefore , if the conditions for emission discussed by @xcite are valid , we deduce that in that period was characterized by a quasi - continuous emission of and possibly detectable neutrinos .",
    "unfortunately neither agile nor ( nor sensitive neutrino detectors ) were operational in 2006 to test this picture . in the future , such a possible prolonged active state accompanied by a quasi - continuous emission of ( of hadronic origin ) might reach a neutrino flux close to detection by instruments such as icecube .",
    "effective particle acceleration in microquasar jet makes these objects strong sources of mev - tev .",
    "these can be produced via leptonc interactions ( e.g. ic scattering of low energy photons by relativistic electrons ) , as well as via hadronic processes ( e.g. , @xmath21 or @xmath15 interactions ) . in case of hadronic interactions ,",
    "the flux of is accompanied by emission of he neutrinos",
    ". therefore , these sources are interesting target of observations with he neutrino detectors .",
    "we investigated in this paper the possibility of detecting he neutrinos from within a hadronic model of emission .",
    "we discussed a simplified picture of hadronic production , namely we assumed that the protons are effectively accelerated by the jet up to 100 tev energies ( the achieved maximum energy of protons depends on the magnetic field and on the size of jet ) .",
    "these protons can escape from the jet and interact with cold protons in the wind of the companion star . from these inelastic collisions ,",
    "neutral and charged pions are produced with subsequent substantial neutrino emission . in this scenario ,",

    "this condition is expected to be satisfied for at superior conjunction where the modulated emission along the orbit reaches its maximum @xcite .",
    "the absorption of ( by uv stellar photons from the wr star ) does not affect the propagation of photons at mev / gev energies ( unlike the tev ) , therefore the minimum index of the initial proton energy distribution can be derived from the flares to be @xmath127 ( from agile data ) .",
