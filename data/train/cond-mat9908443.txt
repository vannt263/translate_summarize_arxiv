    "by now , there is a fairly good understanding of the nature and properties of phase transitions in systems in thermal equilibrium , as one changes the strengths of external fields such as temperature , pressure or magnetic field . on the other hand",
    "there is a wide variety of inherently _ nonequilibrium _ systems in nature whose steady states are not described by the equilibrium gibbs distribution , but are instead determined by the underlying microscopic dynamical processes .",
    "the steady states of such systems may undergo nonequilibrium phase transitions as one changes the rates of the underlying dynamical processes . as compared to their equilibrium counterparts , these nonequilibrium steady states and the transitions between them are much less understood owing to the lack of a general framework .",
    "it is therefore necessary to study simple models of nonequilibrium processes , both in order to discover new types of transitions as well as to understand the mechanisms which give rise to them .    in this paper",
    ", we study nonequilibrium phase transitions in an important class of systems which involve the microscopic processes of diffusion , aggregation upon contact and fragmentation of masses .",
    "these processes arise in a variety of physical settings , for example , in the formation of colloidal suspensions@xcite , polymer gels@xcite , river networks@xcite , aerosols and clouds@xcite .",
    "they also enter in an important way in surface growth phenomena involving island formation@xcite .",
    "below we introduce a simple lattice model incorporating these microscopic processes and study the nonequilibrium steady states and the transitions between them both analytically within mean field theory and numerically in one dimension . some of the results of this paper have been reported earlier in a shorter version@xcite    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , we define the model and summarize our main results . in section iii , we solve the mean field theory exactly and characterize the phases and the transitions between them . in section iv , we report the results of numerical simulations in one dimension for both symmetric and asymmetric transport of masses . in section",
    "v , the model in one dimension is mapped exactly to a lattice gas model whose properties are used to deduce the steady state mass distribution exactly in two extreme limits . in section",
    "vi , we map this lattice gas model further to an interface model and make connections to other well studied interface models in some limits .",
    "we study the dynamics via computing the width of the interface both analytically in some limiting cases and numerically otherwise .",
    "we identify two new fixed points of interface dynamics in @xmath0 dimension . in section vii ,",
    "we generalize our model to include an arbitrary fragmentation kernel and obtain exact results for special choices of this kernel via mappings to other solvable models of statistical mechanics . in the appendix we outline the exact solution for uniform fragmentation kernels .",
    "we finally conclude with a summary and a few open questions in section viii .",
    "our model of diffusion , aggregation and dissociation is defined on a lattice , and evolves in continuous time . for simplicity",
    "we define it on a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions although generalizations to higher dimensions are quite straightforward . beginning with a state in which the masses are placed randomly ,",
    "a site @xmath3 is chosen at random .",
    "then one of the following events can occur :    1 .   diffusion and aggregation : with rate @xmath4 , the mass @xmath5 at site @xmath3 moves either to site @xmath6 or to site @xmath7 .",
    "if it moves to a site which already has some particles , then the total mass just adds up ; thus @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "2 .   chipping ( single - particle dissociation ) : with rate @xmath10 , a bit of the mass at the site `` chips '' off , _",
    "i.e. _ provided @xmath11 , a single particle leaves site @xmath3 and moves with equal probability to one of the neighbouring sites @xmath6 and @xmath7 ; thus @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "we rescale the time , @xmath14 , so that the diffusion and aggregation move occurs with rate @xmath15 while chipping occurs with rate @xmath16 .",
    "this model clearly is a very simplified attempt to describe systems with aggregation and dissociation occuring in nature .",
    "for example , if one is thinking of gelation phenomena , then a polymer of size @xmath17 is represented by a point particle of mass @xmath17 in our model .",
    "thus we ignore the spatial shape of the real polymer which however can play an important role under certain situations .",
    "we have also assumed that the fusion of masses after hopping or chipping occurs instantaneously , i.e. , the reaction time scale is much smaller than the diffusion time scale .",
    "thus our model is diffusion - limited .",
    "a somewhat more severe assumption is however that both desorption and diffusion rates are independent of the mass . in a more realistic situation",
    "these rates will depend upon the mass .",
    "however , our aim here is not to study any specific system in full generality , but rather to identify the mechanism of a dynamical phase transition , if any , in the simplest possible scenario involving these microscopic processes .",
    "if one is interested in a more realistic description of any specific system , one could and should include these features in the model .",
    "but for the purpose of this paper , we stay with the simplest version and show below that even within this simplest scenario novel , dynamical phase transitions occur which are nontrivial yet amenable to analysis .    in this model ,",
    "the total mass @xmath18 is conserved and fixed by the initial condition .",
    "let @xmath19 denote the density , i.e. , mass per site where @xmath20 is number of sites of the lattice .",
    "in the above definition of the model , mass at each site can move symmetrically either to the left or to the right with equal probability .",
    "we call this the symmetric conserved - mass aggregation model ( scmam ) . in this paper",
    "we also study the fully asymmetric version of the model where masses are constrained to move only in one direction ( say to the left ) .",
    "we call this the asymmetric conserved - mass aggregation model ( ascmam ) . in the sections that follow ,",
    "we show that the nonequilibrium critical behaviour of scmam and ascmam belong to different universality classes .",
    "this can be traced to the fact that in the asymmetric case there is a nonzero mass current density in the system .    in both of these models , there are only two parameters , namely the conserved density @xmath21 and the ratio @xmath16 of the rate of chipping of unit mass to that of hopping of the entire mass on a site , as a whole .",
    "the question that we mainly address in this paper is : given @xmath22 , does the system reach a steady state in the long time limit ?",
    "if so , how can we characterize this steady state ?",
    "we show below that indeed for all @xmath23 , the system does reach a steady state .",
    "this is a nonequilibrium steady state in the sense that for generic values of @xmath22 it is not described by the gibbs distribution associated with some hamiltonian . in order to characterize the steady state we study the single site mass distribution function @xmath24 as the time @xmath25 . we show below that there exists a critical curve in the @xmath23 plane across which the steady state behaviour of the system , as characterized by @xmath26 , undergoes a novel phase transition .",
    "let us summarize our main results : in our model , there are two competing dynamical processes .",
    "the diffusion cum coalescence move tends to produce massive aggregates at the expense of smaller masses , and in this process , also creates more vacant sites .",
    "the chipping of single units of mass , on the other hand , leads to a replenishment of the lower end of the mass spectrum .",
    "the result of this competition is that two types of steady states are possible , and there is a dynamical phase transition between the two across a critical line @xmath27 in the @xmath22 plane . for a fixed @xmath28 , if @xmath29 , the steady state mass distribution @xmath26 decays exponentially for large @xmath30 . at @xmath31",
    ", @xmath26 decays as a power law @xmath32 for large @xmath30 , where the exponent @xmath33 is the same everywhere on the critical line @xmath27 .",
    "a more striking and interesting behaviour occurs for @xmath34 . in this phase",
    ", @xmath26 decays as the same power law @xmath35 for large @xmath30 as at the critical point , but in addition develops a delta function peak at @xmath36 .",
    "physically this means that an infinite aggregate forms that subsumes a finite fraction of the total mass , and coexists with smaller finite clusters whose mass distribution has a power law tail . in the language of sol - gel transitions ,",
    "the infinite aggregate is like the gel while the smaller clusters form the sol .",
    "however , as opposed to models of irreversible gelation where the sol disappears in the steady state , in our model the gel coexists with the sol , which has a power law distribution of mass .",
    "interestingly , the mechanism of the formation of the infinite aggregate in the steady state resembles bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , though the condensate ( the infinite aggregate here ) forms in real space rather than momentum space as in conventional bec .",
    "this nontrivial dynamical phase transition occurs in both the models scmam and ascmam in all spatial dimensions @xmath37 including @xmath38 .",
    "we expect that the exponent @xmath33 depends on the dimension @xmath37 but is universal with respect to lattice structures and initial conditions . however , the bias in the movement of masses that distinguishes the two models scmam and ascmam is a relevant perturbation and the corresponding exponents @xmath39 ( for scmam ) and @xmath40 ( for ascmam ) differ from each other",
    ".    we comment on the relationship of our model and results to earlier work on related models .",
    "\\(i ) takayasu and coworkers have studied@xcite a lattice model where masses diffuse and aggregate upon contact as in our model .",
    "however our model differs from the takayasu model in the following important way . in that model",
    "there is a nonzero rate of injection of a single unit of mass from the outside into each lattice site , whereas in our model the takayasu injection move is replaced by the ` chipping ' of a single unit of mass to a neighbouring lattice site .",
    "thus in our model total mass is conserved as opposed to the takayasu model where total mass increases linearly with time . in the takayasu model the mass distribution",
    "@xmath26 has a power law decay in the steady state@xcite but there is no phase transition as in our conserved model . finally , while the directed and undirected versions of the takayasu model evolve in the same way , in our model directionality in motion changes the universality class .",
    "\\(ii ) in the context of polymer chain growth kinetics , models of aggregation in ` dry ' environments have been studied earlier only within a rate equation approach@xcite .",
    "although the aggregation of polymers and dissociation of single monomers were allowed in those models , they lacked the important process of the local diffusion of masses which is included in our lattice model .",
    "\\(iii ) models of vacancy cluster formation consider the attachment and detachment of single vacancies to clusters @xcite , often with rates that depend on the cluster size .",
    "this would correspond to allowing only chipping moves in our model ( section v a ) . since cluster aggregation moves are absent in this case",
    ", there is no tendency to form very large clusters and the mass distribution decays exponentially with @xmath30 .",
    "\\(iv ) recently , lattice gas models have been proposed @xcite to describe the distribution of droplets in fast - expanding systems such as in the fragmentation process following a nuclear collision .",
    "the distribution of fragments shows a pronounced peak at the large mass end , reminiscent of our infinite aggregate .",
    "however , the distribution of the remaining fragments decays exponentially , and not as a power law as in our case .",
    "\\(v ) bose - einstein - like condensation in real space has also been found in lattice gas models of traffic @xcite in which different cars have different maximum speeds , chosen from an _ a priori _ specified distribution .",
    "this corresponds to phase separation into high density and low density regions , a phenomenon which is also found when randomness in hopping rates is associated with fixed points in space , rather than with cars @xcite .",
    "an important difference between these studies and ours is that they involve quenched disorder ( the assignment of different maximum speeds , either to cars , or to different lattice sites ) , whereas the bec phenomenon in our case occurs in the absence of disorder , in a translationally invariant system .",
    "in this section , we study the conserved mass models within the mean field approximation which keeps track only of the distributions of masses , ignoring correlations in the occupancy of adjacent sites .",
    "the mean field theory is identical for both the symmetric and asymmetric models .",
    "this is a defect of the mf approximation as , in fact , the existence of a nonzero mass current in the asymmetric model affects fluctuations in an important way .",
    "although mf theory misses this important aspect of the physics , it is still instructive since it reproduces the phase diagram correctly , at least qualitatively .",
    "besides , in high dimensions where fluctuations are negligible , the mf theory captures the correct physics even quantitatively .    ignoring correlations between masses at neighbouring sites on the lattice",
    ", one can directly write down the evolution equation for @xmath41 , the probability that any site has a mass @xmath30 at time @xmath42 .",

    "the above equations enumerate all possible ways in which the mass at a site might change .",
    "the first term in eq . ( [ eq : mft1 ] ) is the `` loss '' term that accounts for the probability that a mass @xmath30 might move as a whole or chip off to either of the neighbouring sites , or that a mass from a neighbouring site might move or chip off to the site in consideration .",
    "the probability of occupation of the neighbouring site , @xmath46 , multiplies @xmath24 within the mean - field approximation where one neglects the spatial correlations in the occupation probabilities of neighbouring sites .",
    "the remaining three terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mft1 ] ) are the `` gain '' terms enumerating the number of ways that a site with mass @xmath47 can gain the deficit mass @xmath48 .",
    "the second equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : mft2 ] ) is a similar enumeration of the possibilities for loss and gain of empty sites .",
    "evidently , the mf equations conserve the total mass .    to solve the equations , we compute the generating function , @xmath49 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : mft1 ] ) and set @xmath50 in the steady state",
    ". we also need to use eq .",
    "( [ eq : mft2 ] ) to write @xmath51 in terms of @xmath52 .",
    "this gives us a quadratic equation for @xmath53 in the steady state .",
    "choosing the root that corresponds to @xmath54 , we find + @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "the value of the occupation probability @xmath57 is fixed by mass conservation which implies that @xmath58 .",
    "putting @xmath59 , the resulting relation between @xmath21 and @xmath57 is @xmath60    the steady state probability distribution @xmath26 is the coefficient of @xmath61 in @xmath62 and can be obtained from @xmath62 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : qsol ] ) by evaluating the integral @xmath63 over the contour @xmath64 encircling the origin .",
    "the singularities of the integrand govern the asymptotic behaviour of @xmath26 for large @xmath30 .",
    "clearly the integrand has branch cuts at @xmath65 . for fixed @xmath28 ,",
    "if one increases the density @xmath21 , the occupation probability @xmath57 also increases as evident from eq .",
    "( [ eq : defq ] ) . as a result , both the roots @xmath66 start decreasing . as long as the lower root @xmath67 is greater than @xmath15 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : defq ] ) is well defined and the analysis of the contour integration around the branch cut @xmath68 , yields for large @xmath30 , @xmath69 where the characteristic mass , @xmath70 .",
    "it diverges as @xmath71 as @xmath57 approaches @xmath72 .",
    "@xmath73 is the critical value of @xmath57 at which @xmath74 .",
    "this exponentially decaying mass distribution is the signature of the  disordered \" phase which occurs for @xmath75 or equivalently from eq .",
    "( [ eq : defq ] ) for @xmath76 .",
    "when @xmath77 , we have @xmath74 , and analysis of the contour around @xmath78 yields a power law decay of @xmath26 , @xmath79 as @xmath21 is increased further beyond @xmath80 , @xmath57 can not increase any more because if it does so , the root @xmath67 would be less than @xmath15 ( while the other root @xmath81 is still bigger than @xmath15 ) and the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : defq ] ) would become complex .",
    "the only possibility is that @xmath57 sticks to its critical value @xmath73 or equivalently the lower root @xmath67 sticks to @xmath15 .",
    "physically this implies that adding more particles does not change the occupation probability of sites .",
    "this can happen only if all the additional particles ( as @xmath21 is increased ) aggregate on a vanishing fraction of sites , thus not contributing to the occupation of the others .",
    "hence in this  infinite - aggregate \" phase @xmath26 has an infinite - mass aggregate , in addition to a cluster distribution with a power law decay @xmath82 . concomitantly eq . ( [ eq : defq ] ) ceases to hold , and the relation now becomes @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the fraction of the mass in the infinite aggregate .",
    "the mechanism of the formation of the aggregate is reminiscent of bose einstein condensation . in that case , for temperatures in which a macroscopic condensate exists , particles added to the system do not contribute to the occupation of the excited states ; they only add to the condensate , as they do to the infinite aggregate here .",
    "thus the mf phase diagram ( see inset of fig .",
    "1 ) of the system consists of two phases ,  exponential \" and  aggregate \" , which are separated by the phase boundary , @xmath85 . we note that in conserved - aggregation models in ` dry ' environment studied earlier within a rate equation approach@xcite , the steady state mass distribution also changed from an exponential distribution to a power law as the density was increased to a critical value .",
    "however , the existence of the infinite aggregate in the steady state for @xmath86 was not identified earlier .",
    "in order to see if the mf phase diagram remains at least qualitatively correct in lower dimensions , we have studied both scmam and ascmam using monte carlo simulations on a one - dimensional lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "although we present results here for a relatively small size lattice , @xmath87 , we have checked our results for larger sizes as well .",
    "we confirmed that all the qualitative predictions of the mean - field theory remain true in @xmath15-d though the exponents change from their mf values .",
    "figure 1 displays two numerically obtained plots of @xmath26 in the steady state of scmam . for fixed @xmath88 ,",
    "we have measured @xmath26 for two values of the density , namely @xmath89 and @xmath90 . for @xmath89 , we find exponential decay of @xmath26 ( denoted by @xmath91 in fig .",
    "1 ) . for @xmath90",
    ", @xmath26 decays as a power law ( denoted by @xmath92 in fig .",
    "1 ) which is cut off by finite size effects but in addition , there is a sharp peak at a much larger mass signalling the existence of the ` infinite ' aggregate as predicted in the mf theory .",
    "we confirmed that the mass @xmath93 in this aggregate grows linearly with the size , and that the spread @xmath94 grows sublinearly , implying that the ratio @xmath95 approaches zero in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "as one decreases @xmath21 for fixed @xmath28 , the mass @xmath93 decreases and finally vanishes at the critical point , @xmath27 where @xmath26 only has a power law tail . for @xmath96",
    ", we find numerically @xmath97 . in the inset of fig . 1 , we plot the numerical phase boundary in the @xmath23 plane ( denoted by closed circles ) .",
    "this is only a rough estimate of the phase boundary obtained from small lattice sizes and the numerical accuracy of these points should not be taken too seriously .",
    "for comparision , we also plot the mf phase boundary @xmath98 .    in fig . 2 and in its inset , we present similar plots for the asymmetric model ascmam . here",
    "the steady state mass distribution function @xmath26 is plotted for two values of the density @xmath89 and @xmath99 with fixed @xmath88 . in the first case",
    ", @xmath26 decays exponentially whereas in the second case it has a power law tail and in addition the ` infinite ' aggregate as in the case of scmam .",
    "the exponent @xmath100 for scmam which characterizes the finite - mass fragment power law decay for @xmath86 is numerically found to be @xmath101 and remains the same at the critical point @xmath31 . in the asymmetric model ascmam",
    ", we find the corresponding exponent @xmath102 within numerical error .",
    "note however that because the total mass and hence the mass density , @xmath103 is conserved and finite , the decay of @xmath26 must be faster than @xmath104 for large @xmath30 to avoid ultraviolet divergence . in ascmam",
    "the numerical value of @xmath40 in @xmath15-d is very close to @xmath105 suggesting perhaps that @xmath26 decays as @xmath104 with additional logarithmic corrections such that @xmath21 remains finite .",
    "but within our simulations , it is not easy to detect these additional logarithmic factors .",
    "thus clearly in @xmath15-d , scmam and ascmam belong to different universality classes .",
    "in this section , we show that in one dimension the mass model studied above can be mapped exactly onto a lattice gas ( lg ) model consisting of particles and holes . in the language of the lg model , it is somewhat easier to understand the two phases and the transition between them . besides , for certain limiting values of the parameters , the steady state of the lg model can be solved exactly .",
    "this then provides , via the mapping , exact solutions for the mass model in those limiting cases .",
    "consider the mass model ( both scmam and ascmam ) on a ring @xmath106 of @xmath20 lattice sites .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the mass at site @xmath3 of @xmath106 in a given configuration .",
    "let @xmath107 denote the total mass on @xmath106 .",
    "we first construct a new ring @xmath108 consisting of @xmath109 sites . for every lattice site @xmath3 of ring @xmath106 , we put a particle ( labelled by @xmath3 ) on ring @xmath108 such that the @xmath3-th and @xmath110-th particle on @xmath108 are separated exactly by @xmath5 holes .",
    "the ring @xmath108 will therefore have @xmath20 particles and @xmath18 holes . also by construction",
    ", these particles on @xmath108 are hard core , i.e. , any site of @xmath108 can contain at the most one particle . thus every mass configuration on @xmath106 maps onto a unique particle - hole configuration on @xmath108 . in fig .",
    "3 , we give an example of this mapping .",
    "we also note that particle density @xmath111 on @xmath108 is simply related to the mass density @xmath21 on @xmath106 via , @xmath112 .    given this exact mapping of a mass configuration on @xmath106 to a particle hole configuration on @xmath108 , we now examine the correspondence between the mass dynamics on @xmath106 and the particle dynamics on @xmath108 .",
    "consider a pair of neighbouring sites @xmath113 and @xmath3 on @xmath106 where the masses are @xmath114 and @xmath5 .",
    "this translates to having @xmath114 holes to the right of @xmath113-th particle and @xmath5 holes to the right of @xmath3-th particle on @xmath108 .",
    "consider first the chipping move that occurs with rate @xmath10 ( fig .",
    "if a single unit of mass chips off the @xmath113-th site and moves to @xmath3-th site ( i.e. , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) on @xmath106 , it corresponds to the @xmath3-th particle on @xmath108 hopping to its neighbouring site to the left with rate @xmath10 .",
    "similarly , the reverse move of a unit mass chipping off @xmath3-th site to @xmath113-th site on @xmath106 ( i.e. , @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) corresponds to the @xmath3-th particle on @xmath108 hopping one step to the right with rate @xmath10 .",
    "thus the chipping move of scmam on @xmath106 corresponds precisely to the  symmetric exclusion process \" ( sep)@xcite on @xmath108 where a particle can hop to its nearest neighbour on either side provided the neighbour is empty .",
    "similarly the chipping move of ascmam on @xmath106 corresponds exactly to the  asymmetric exclusion process \" ( asep)@xcite on @xmath108 where particles move only along one direction on @xmath108 .",
    "but in addition to chipping , we also have the diffusion and aggregation move in the mass model that occurs with rate @xmath4 ( as shown for the block of particles in fg .",
    "3 ) . consider once again a pair of sites @xmath113 and @xmath3 with respective masses @xmath114 and @xmath119 on @xmath106 .",
    "suppose the whole mass @xmath114 moves to the @xmath3-th site ( i.e. , @xmath120 and @xmath121 ) .",
    "this would mean that on @xmath108 , the @xmath3-th particle jumps to the farthest available hole ( without crossing the @xmath113-th particle ) to its left with rate @xmath4 .",
    "similarly the reverse move , @xmath122 and @xmath123 , would translate on @xmath108 to the @xmath3-th particle jumping to the farthest available hole to its right ( without crossing the @xmath110-th particle ) with rate @xmath4 . in the asymmetric version of the model , the particle can jump to the farthest available hole ( without crossing the next particle ) in one direction only .",
    "to summarize , in our lg model we have a bunch of hard core particles with particle density @xmath111 .",
    "the world lines of particles can not touch or cross each other due to their hard core nature .",
    "there are two possible moves for each particle . with rate @xmath10",
    ", a particle moves to its adjacent site ( if it is empty ) and with rate @xmath4 the particle jumps to the farthest available hole maintaining the hard core constraint . in scmam ,",
    "the particle can hop with equal probability to the left or right . in ascmam , it hops only in one direction , say to the right . in this lg language",
    ", it is the competition between the short range and long range hopping of the particles that is responsible for the phase transition . as in the mass model ,",
    "the only two parameters of the model are the ratio of the two rates , @xmath16 and the density of particles @xmath111 .",
    "we also note that @xmath26 in the mass model corresponds to the size distribution of hole clusters in the lg model .    in the following we fix the density of particles @xmath111 and study the two extreme limits @xmath124 and @xmath125 where exact results can be obtained .      since @xmath16 ,",
    "the limit @xmath124 corresponds to @xmath126 with @xmath10 remaining nonzero .",
    "this means only chipping moves are allowed in the mass model . as mentioned in section ii , in this limit the model has some resemblance to models of vacancy cluster formation @xcite , with mass in our model representing the number of vacancies in a cluster .",
    "chipping off from clusters with @xmath127 corresponds to vacancy detachment , whereas the chipping move for @xmath128 is tantamount to either diffusive hopping ( if the neighbouring site is empty ) , or to attachment to a cluster ( if the neighbouring site has a mass on it ) .    in the lg version ,",
    "the ` only - chipping ' model corresponds to just the exclusion process@xcite either symmetric ( sep ) ( corresponding to scmam ) or asymmetric ( asep ) ( corresponding to ascmam ) .",
    "both the sep and asep have been studied in great detail and several exact results are known@xcite .",
    "in particular it is known that in the steady states of both sep and asep , all configurations are equally likely@xcite .",
    "this means that in the thermodynamic limit , the steady state has a simple product measure : the probability @xmath26 of having exactly @xmath30 holes following a particle is simply given by , @xmath129 .",
    "using @xmath130 , we thus obtain an exact result for @xmath26 of the mass model in the @xmath124 limit , p(m)= ^m [ eq : pm9 ] which clearly demonstrates the exponential decay of @xmath26 for large @xmath30",
    ".    we note in passing that eq.([eq : pm9 ] ) also describes the distribution of masses in any dimension in an ` only chipping ' model in which the rate of chipping at site @xmath3 is proportional to the mass @xmath5 on that site . in this case",
    ", evidently every unit of mass performs a simple random walk , and the problem is tantamount to that of @xmath18 independent random walkers on the lattice .",
    "standard methods of statistical mechanics can then be used to describe the steady state .",
    "the grand partition function is then z = ( 1 + z + z^2 ) ^n = 1 ( 1-z)^n [ eq : grand ] where @xmath2 is the fugacity , and the probability of finding @xmath30 particles on a site is p(m ) = ( 1-z ) z^m .",
    "[ eq : fugacity ] eliminating @xmath2 in favour of @xmath131 , we see that eq.([eq : fugacity ] ) reduces to eq.([eq : pm9 ] ) .",
    "we now consider the other limit @xmath125 where there is no chipping and the masses only diffuse as a whole and aggregate with each other . in the lg language",
    ", this would mean that particles undergo only long range hopping to the farthest available hole ( without crossing the next particle ) .    in order to find the exact steady state in this limit , we first consider the mass model on a finite ring @xmath106 of @xmath20 sites and total mass @xmath132 . as",
    "time progresses , masses diffuse and coagulate with each other and the number of empty sites decreases . since the diffusive motion confined in a finite region of space is ergodic , eventually all the masses will coagulate with each other and there will be precisely one single big conglomerate with mass @xmath18 which will move on the ring .",
    "thus in the steady state , one gets exactly , @xmath133 . in the lg language",
    ", this would mean that on a finite lattice , the particles and holes will become completely phase separated in the steady state .",
    "it is also useful to study the approach to this phase separated steady state .",
    "we first note that on an infinite @xmath15-d lattice , the time dependent single site mass distribution function , @xmath24 can be exactly solved in the @xmath125 limit@xcite .",
    "it was shown exactly in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the scaling limit , @xmath134 , @xmath25 but keeping @xmath135 fixed , the function @xmath136 where the constant @xmath137 depends on the initial condition but the scaling function @xmath138 is universal and is given by s(x)= x. in the lg model , this would mean that as time progresses , the system undergoes phase separation and breaks into domains of particles and holes .",
    "the average linear size of these domains grows with time as @xmath139 at late times .",
    "at this point it is useful also to note that in usual models of coarsening with locally conserved dynamics , the domain size grows as @xmath140@xcite as opposed to @xmath141 here .",
    "this , however , is not entirely surprising since in our model , even though the particle number is conserved globally , the long range hopping effectively reduces this to a locally nonconserved model with growth law @xmath141 .",
    "similar behaviour was noticed earlier in other models of coarsening with globally conserved dynamics@xcite . in an infinite system",
    "the domain size keeps growing indefinitely as @xmath139 .",
    "however in a finite lattice of sites @xmath142 , when @xmath143 after a time @xmath144 , the domains stop growing and the system eventually breaks up into two domains only , one of particles and the other of holes .",
    "we note that all the conclusions made in this subsection are equally valid for both symmetric and asymmetric versions of the model .    to summarize this section",
    ", we find that for fixed @xmath21 in one dimension , the two extreme limits @xmath145 and @xmath124 are exactly solvable for their steady states .",
    "in the limit @xmath145 , the system has a phase separated steady state in the lg model which in the mass model corresponds to having a single massive aggregate . in the other limit @xmath124",
    ", the lg corresponds to simple exclusion process with product measure steady state , which corresponds to an exponential mass distribution in the mass model .",
    "thus there is a competition between the long range hopping that tends to create phase separation and the short range hopping that tends to mix the particles and holes to produce a product measure steady state . as @xmath28 is increased from @xmath146 for fixed @xmath21 , the massive aggregate coexists with power law distributed smaller masses ( or hole clusters in the lg language ) up to some critical value @xmath147 . for @xmath148 , the massive aggregate disappears and the cluster size distribution of holes becomes exponential .",
    "the phase separated state found in the lattice model is reminiscent of the state found in lattice gas models of traffic with quenched disorder , either in the distribution of maximum velocities of different cars @xcite or at different locations on the road @xcite .",
    "our model , by contrast , has no disorder and is translationally invariant to start with , although this symmetry is broken in the phase - separated state .",
    "in the previous sections we have studied the static properties of the model in the steady state .",
    "however it is also important to study the dynamics of the model in the steady state .",
    "the universal features of the dynamics is usually best captured by time dependent correlation functions in the steady state . in this section",
    "we however take a slightly different route . instead of studying the time - dependent correlation functions directly in the mass or the equivalent latice gas model ,",
    "we first map the lg model onto an interface model and then study the time dependent properties of the width of the fluctuating interfaces .",
    "the advantage of this route is that not only does it capture the essential universal features of the dynamics , but it also makes contact with other well studied interface models in certain limiting cases .",
    "there is a standard way@xcite to map a lg configuration in one dimension to that of an interface configuration on a @xmath15-d substrate .",
    "one defines a new set of variables @xmath149 such that @xmath150 if the @xmath3-th site is occupied by a particle and @xmath151 if it is empty .",
    "then the interface height @xmath152 at site @xmath3 is defined as , @xmath153 .",
    "thus the overall tilt of the interface , @xmath154 is set by the particle density @xmath111 in the lg model .",
    "the different dynamical moves in the lg model can be translated in a one to one fashion to corresponding moves of the interface .",
    "for example , if a particle at site @xmath3 jumps one unit to the right , it corresponds to the decrease of height @xmath152 by @xmath105 units , @xmath155 .",
    "similarly , if the particle at site @xmath110 jumps one unit to the left , the height @xmath152 increases by @xmath105 units , @xmath156 .",
    "thus the nearest neighbour hopping of particles to the left or right in the lg model corresponds respectively to deposition and evaporation moves in the interface model .",
    "similarly the long range hopping of a particle to the farthest available hole before the next particle would translate to nonlocal moves in the interface as shown in fig .",
    "3 . once again , the ratio of the rates of evaporation - deposition moves to that of the nonlocal moves is given by the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "a natural measure of the fluctuations of the interface is its width defined for a finite system of size @xmath142 as , w(l , t)= [ width ] where @xmath157 .",
    "the width @xmath158 is expected to have a scaling form@xcite , w(l , t)~l^f ( t / l^z ) , in the scaling limit with large @xmath142 , large @xmath42 but keeping @xmath159 finite .",
    "the exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 are respectively the roughness and the dynamical exponents and the scaling function @xmath160 is universal with the aymptotic behaviour : @xmath161 as @xmath162 and @xmath163 as @xmath164 where @xmath165 .",
    "the exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 characterize the universality classes of the interface models .    in the following we keep the particle density @xmath111 fixed and investigate the width of the corresponding interface model @xmath158 by varying the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "how do the exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 that characterize the universal behaviour of interface fluctuations change as one varies @xmath28 from @xmath146 to @xmath166 ?",
    "we study this question for both the symmetric and the asymmetric models and denote the respective exponents by @xmath167 and @xmath168 . in the following three subsections",
    ", we study the width @xmath158 in both models for three special values of @xmath28 , namely @xmath124 , @xmath125 and @xmath169 . in the first two cases we find analytical results whereas in the last case",
    ", we present numerical results only .",
    "we first consider the symmetric mass model scmam whose lattice gas equivalent corresponds to the sep in the @xmath124 limit as noted in section v. this means that in the corresponding interface model , nonlocal moves are absent and only the allowed moves are evaporation and deposition subject to certain local constraints .",
    "an important property of this symmetric model is that the average velocity of the interface is zero as the evaporation and deposition occurs with equal probability .",
    "it is well known@xcite that the continuum version of this discrete interface model corresponding to sep is well described by the edwards - wilkinson equation@xcite .",
    "this linear evolution equation can be easily solved and one gets the exact exponents@xcite , ^(s)=1;^(s)=2 .",
    "[ edw ]    the lg equivalent of the asymmetric mass model ascmam in the @xmath170 limit is the asep . in the corresponding interface model",
    "the allowed moves are either only deposition or only evaporation ( but not both ) depending upon the direction of particle motion in asep .",
    "thus the interface has a nonzero average velocity and its continuum version is known@xcite to be described by the nonlinear kpz equation@xcite . in one dimension ,",
    "the kpz equation can be solved exactly and the exponents are known to be@xcite , ^(as)=1;^(as)=3 .",

    "eventually the system breaks up into two domains of opposite signs . in the interface representation",

    ", we keep the density @xmath130 fixed and tune @xmath28 to its critical value , @xmath179 and calculate the width @xmath158 of the interface .",
    "unfortunately we are unable to obtain any analytical result for this critical case and will only present numerical estimates .",
    "we first consider the symmetric model . in this case",
    "we fix @xmath180 . in the lg language",
    "this means particle density , @xmath181 .",
    "we first estimate the critical point , @xmath182 by simulating the equivalent mass model .",

    "we did not find a good data collapse using the canonical scaling form , @xmath195 .",
    "instead we tried collapsing the data assuming , @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the steady state width @xmath198 .",

    "5 . with the choice @xmath199 . in the inset , we plot @xmath197 vs. @xmath142 .",
    "it is difficult to estimate the asymptotic growth @xmath200 ( possibly with a logarithmic corrections ) from the available data .",
    "a naive linear fit to the log - log plot of @xmath197 vs. @xmath142 gives an estimate of the slope , @xmath201 .",
    "thus given the available data , we find the approximate estimates for the exponents , @xmath202 and @xmath203 at the critical point of the asymmetric model .",

    "in the mass model discussed so far we have considered only two possible moves , namely  chipping \" of a single unit of mass to a neighbouring site with rate @xmath28 or hopping of the mass as a whole to a neighbouring site with rate @xmath15 . however in a more general setting , @xmath17 units of mass can break off a mass @xmath30 and hop to a neighbouring site with rate @xmath217 where @xmath218 . in the equivalent lattice gas version in one dimension",

    "thus in all these cases studied in this section , we find exponential decay of the mass distribution for large mass in the steady state .",
    "it would therefore seem that only for the special kernel , @xmath234 , is there a nontrivial phase transition from a phase where @xmath26 decays exponentially to another where it has a power law decay in addition to an infinite aggregate .",
    "the presence of two delta function peaks in @xmath217 seem to be crucially responsible for this phase transition .",
    "we believe that the phase transition will still persist if one allows for a nonzero width to the delta peaks at the two ends of the kernel near @xmath235 and @xmath236 but making sure that the widths remain finite even as @xmath134 .",
    "this however needs further studies to be confirmed .",
    "in this paper we have studied a lattice model of aggregation and dissociation where a mass from a site can either move as a whole to a neighbouring site with rate @xmath4 or can chip off a unit mass to a neighbour with rate @xmath10 .",
    "the hopped mass then aggregates instantaneously with the mass that is already present at the neighbour .",
    "the ratio of the rates , @xmath16 and the conserved mass density @xmath21 are the only two parameters of the model .",
    "the steady state of the model undergoes a phase transition as the parameters @xmath22 are varied . in the @xmath23 plane",
    "there is a critical line that separates two phases : ( i ) the ` exponential ' phase where the single site mass distribution @xmath26 decays exponentially for large @xmath30 and ( ii ) the ` aggregate ' phase where @xmath26 has a power law decay in addition to a delta function peak at @xmath36 signifying the presence of an infinite aggregate . on the critical line ,",
    "the aggregate vanishes but @xmath237 retains the same power law tail .",
    "we have also studied how the universality class of this dynamical phase transition changes on applying a bias in a particular direction of the mass transport .",
    "we have solved the model exactly within the mean field theory and presented numerical results for one dimension . besides , by exploiting a mapping to a lattice gas model in @xmath15-d , we have obtained the steady state distribution @xmath26 exactly for small and large @xmath28 .",
    "we have further mapped the lattice gas model to an interface model in @xmath0 dimension and studied the width of the interface that characterizes its fluctuations .",
    "we have calculated the roughness exponent @xmath1 and the dynamical exponent @xmath2 analytically for small and large @xmath28 both with and without bias .",
    "we have computed these exponents numerically at the critical point and shown that the two critical points ( with and without bias ) represent two new fixed points of interface dynamics in @xmath0 dimension .",
    "we have also generalized our model to include arbitrary fragmentation kernels and obtained a few exact results for special choices of these kernels via mappings to other solvable statistical mechanics models studied in the recent past .",
    "our model obviously has some shortcomings as a model of realistic aggregation and fragmentation phenomena .",
    "for example , we have assumed that the rate of hopping of a mass as a whole is independent of the mass . in a realistic setting",
    "this is perhaps not a good approximation . for realistic modelling of a specific system",
    ", one needs to put in these details .",
    "this however was not attempted in this paper , whose aim is to understand the mechanism of the dynamical phase transition induced by the basic microscopic processes of diffusion , aggregation and fragmentation within a simple setting .    however there",
    "remain many open questions even for this simple model .",
    "for example , in one dimension we were not able to compute analytically the various exponents at the critical point .",
    "given that there has been recent progress in determining the exact steady states of a class of exclusion processes in one dimension via using matrix product ansatz@xcite and coordinate bethe ansatz@xcite , it may be possible to obtain the exact steady states of our model in @xmath15-d .    another important open question that needs to be studied for both the symmetric and asymmetric models : what is the upper critical dimension @xmath238 of these models beyond which the mean field exponents will be exact . from general analogy to other diffusion limited models",
    "studied earlier@xcite , one expects that in the symmetric case @xmath239 .",
    "this expectation is supported by the numerical fact that the the exponent @xmath240 in @xmath15-d is already close to its mean field value @xmath241 .",
    "this conjecture however requires a proof .    the question of upper critical dimension is however puzzling for the asymmetric model where the numerical value of @xmath102 ( perhaps @xmath242 with logarithmic corrections ) is quite far from the mean field value @xmath241",
    "this indicates that the @xmath238 ( if there exists one ) for the asymmetric case might even be bigger than @xmath105 which however is quite contrary to the naive expectation that the @xmath238 of directed models is usually lower than that of undirected models .",
