    "the spin - polarized electrical transport in magnetic multilayer structures has received much attention both experimentally and theoretically in the last several years@xcite .",
    "the yield of the extensive investigation promises fascinating implication for applications in information technology .",
    "for instance , people may make use of the different resistive states corresponding to parallel and antiparallel magnetizations of different layers as memory elements in magnetic random - access memories ( mram ) .",
    "it is now known that the antiparallel alignments of the moments in magnetic layers lead to a higher electrical resistance than the parallel alignments , giving rise to a so - called giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) or tunnel magnetoresistance ( tmr ) depending on different magnetic junction systems .",
    "the origin of these phenomena is widely believed to be mainly caused by the spin - dependent scatterings of the conduction electrons . as is pointed out @xcite ,",
    "when the junction bias is increased , the phenomenon is significantly reduced . generally speaking",
    ", the resistive state can be changed by applying an external magnetic field , because the latter could lead to variations of the traversing paths of the conduction electrons .",
    "however , it is now accepted that not only the electrical current is strongly affected by a magnetic state , but also the electrical current can conversely control the magnetic state of the magnetic junctions .",
    "this effect is predicted by slonczewski @xcite and berger @xcite in magnetic multilayer systems by noting that a spin - polarized electrical current can transfer local spin angular momenta of incident electrons to the scattering ferromagnet , thereby exerting a torque on the magnetic moments and therefore changing the magnetic state . when the current is large enough",
    ", the magnetization of ferromagnetic layer can be switched . as a result",
    ", the spin transfer effect may provide a mechanism for a current - controlled magnetic memory element .",
    "experiments have given evidence of this effect in the cu / co multilayers@xcite , nickel nanowires @xcite , manganite junctions @xcite , point contact magnetic multilayer devices@xcite , bulk manganese oxides@xcite , tunnel junctions@xcite , and co / cu / co spin valve devices @xcite , etc .",
    "a thermally activated switching of magnetic domains in a co / cu / co spin valve is also confirmed @xcite .    to deal with the spin transfer effect , it is useful to introduce the concepts such as the spin current and the spin torque to describe the coupling between the conduction electrons and the magnetic moments of ferromagnetic materials . those are first proposed by slonczewski @xcite based on a quantum - mechanical model .",
    "then , this interaction is derived from the s - d coupling and manifests itself in magnetic multilayersslonczewski or bulk ferromagnets@xcite .",
    "it also gives a contribution as a current - induced force on a domain wall or an interaction between spin waves and itinerant electrons@xcite .",
    "the concepts are also used to deal with a variety of the structures such as the ferromagnet - normal metal - ferromagnet ( fm - nm - fm ) junctions @xcite , the ferromagnet - superconductor - ferromagnet junctions @xcite , and a trilayer fm - nm - fm contacting a normal metal lead or a superconductor leadwaintal1,waintal2 , and so on .",
    "apart from the quantum - mechanical method , the scattering matrix method is improved to cover this issuewaintal , waintal1,waintal2 .",
    "et al _ derived a set of coupled landau - lifshitz equations for the ferromagnetic layers by considering the nonequilibrium exchange interaction between layers@xcite .",
    "et al _ dealt with the dynamic spin transfer torque and thermally assisted magnetization reversal by means of the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equationszhang , szhang1 in which a term describing the spin transfer torque is introduced . the nonequilibrium green function",
    "is also applied to this question to consider the spin - flip scattering effect on the current - induced spin transfer torque@xcite .",
    "so far , the electrical current , the spin transfer effect and the spin current in magnetic multilayer systems are extensively studied under an dc bias voltage , and the investigation under an ac bias is still sparse . whether an ac bias voltage applied to the magnetic tunnel junctions",
    "could induce some unusual properties ( see e.g.@xcite ) , is still not clear . in this paper",
    ", we shall show the effect of an ac bias on the electrical current and the spin transfer torque in a magnetic tunnel junction .",
    "since the switching of magnetic domains depends on the magnitude and the directions of the spin transfer torque , while the direction of the spin transfer torque is related to the direction of the electrical current , it is of interest to anticipate that the response of the system under an ac bias is different from that under an dc bias .",
    "we have found that the spin transfer torque is sharply enhanced by applying an ac electrical field with a particular amplitude and frequency .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , a model is proposed , and the necessary formalism under an ac bias is established . in sec .",
    "iii , the tunneling current under an ac electrical field is derived and studied . in sec .",
    "iv , the current - induced spin transfer torque under an ac electrical field is investigated .",
    "finally , a brief summary is given in sec .",
    "let us consider a magnetic tunnel junction in which two ferromagnets ( fm ) which are stretched to infinite are separated by a thin insulator ( i ) .",
    "the molecular field in the left ferromagnet is assumed to align along @xmath1 axis which is in the junction plane , while the orientation of the molecular field in the right ferromagnet deviates the @xmath1 axis by an angle @xmath2 which is along the @xmath3 axis ( such that the frame @xmath4 deviates @xmath5 by an angle @xmath6 ) . the tunnel current flows along the @xmath7 axis which is perpendicular to the junction plane .",

    "this result is quite similar to eq .",
    "( 3.3 ) in ref.@xcite in which the superconductor tunnel junctions are investigated . by analogy ,",
    "the time dependence of the wave function for every electron state is modulated by @xmath81 .",
    "each single - particle level is modulated in terms of a probability @xmath82 and is displaced in energy by @xmath83 these displacements in energy contributing to the amplitude of the average tunneling current are equivalent to that dc voltages @xmath84 applied across the junction with a probability @xmath85 in eq.([averagecu ] ) , an explicit relation between the time averaged ac tunneling current and the dc current is given , where @xmath86 gives a nontrivial result .",
    "this result implies that only the elastic transmission through the tunnel barrier contributes to the average current , and the net number of photons absorbed from the ac field must be zerojauho1 .",
    "so , every term in the summation of eq.([averagecu ] ) describes the tunneling process that the electrons tunnel from the excited states @xmath87 absorbed @xmath38 photons of the left ferromagnet to the excited states @xmath88 absorbed @xmath89 photons of the right one . in this way",
    ", the summation is taken over all the excited states of the left and the right ferromagnets .",
    "the ac field gives a correction to the transition rate @xmath90 by adding the product of bessel functions , i.e. @xmath91 , which describes the probability of electron population in the excited states .",
    "the tunneling current can be viewed as to happen between the photonic sidebands of the two ferromagnets .",
    "next , let us present the numerical results of the time - dependent electric current . before going on",
    ", we shall first give some presumptions . a parabolic dispersion for band electrons",
    "is assumed , on which is based that the dos of conduction electrons are calculated .",
    "the fermi energy and the molecular field will be taken as @xmath92 ev and @xmath93 ev , which are given in ref.@xcite for fe .",
    "we note that the elements of the coupling matrix @xmath49 and @xmath50 mean the strength of spin - flip scatterings which were discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . in order to focus our attention on the effect of an ac bias",
    ", we shall not consider the effect of spin - flip scatterings here for brevity and simplicity .",
    "so we take @xmath49 @xmath94 @xmath95 , and @xmath96 . in addition",
    ", @xmath97 is assumed , then @xmath98 . under this assumption ,",
    "@xmath99 where @xmath100 is the @xmath38-th bessel function .",
    "when the ac bias is absent , we get @xmath101 @xmath102$]@xcite at zero dc bias , zero temperature ( @xmath103 ) and @xmath6 , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are similar to the formulas as given before , tan@xmath106 and @xmath107(d_{r\\uparrow } + d_{r\\downarrow } ) $ ] . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath108 @xmath109 can be used as a scale to measure the ac current .",
    "the time evolution of the tunnel electrical current @xmath69 in response to an ac field is depicted in fig .",
    "1 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 @xmath112 .",
    "as can be seen , when the dc bias is positive , the current can be negative .",
    "when the ac signal is small ( e.g. @xmath113 ) , the current varies with time in a cosine manner , which appears to be proportional to the ac bias . in this case",
    ", the current response is similar to the dc case , i.e. larger the bias , larger the current .",
    "however , when the ac signal is stronger , things become different .",
    "there appear some resonant peaks , which can be regarded as to be resulted from the photon - assisted tunneling , and the tunnel current is still periodic with time .",
    "the inset of fig.1 shows the case at @xmath114 but with a lower frequency for a comparison .",
    "it is found that the peaks split into several peaks in one period of time , suggesting that the external frequency can change the oscillating frequency of the tunnel current .    the frequency dependence of the averaged tunneling current is shown in fig .",
    "small oscillations of the current with frequency can be seen , which are caused by the summation of the @xmath38-th current @xmath115 with different @xmath38 , @xmath116 , @xmath117 , and @xmath89 owing to @xmath118 oscillating with the frequency and having many peaks .",
    "the peaks of the @xmath38-th current correspond to the troughs of the @xmath119-th current .",
    "furthermore , when the ac signal is small ( e.g. @xmath114 ) , the current first increases with small oscillations , and then , the current almost does not vary with the frequency like a pure resistance because the pure resistance should not vary with the frequency in the common sense .",
    "however , it can be observed that a large ac signal leads to a small averaged current also as those expressed in fig .",
    "the reason for this feature is that an ac bias is imposed on an dc bias , while the summation current decreases with increasing ac bias .",
    "a large @xmath120 means a large argument of bessel function , thus leading to a strong modulation to the current , which makes the current approaching to zero .",
    "if @xmath120 is fixed , a larger @xmath121 gives a larger averaged current , suggesting that the current flows easily in this system under a higher frequency .",
    "this character is consistent with the classical feature of systems that metallic leads are separated by an insulator . here",
    ", we can consider two limiting cases .",
    "when @xmath122 , the argument of the bessel function @xmath123 , then @xmath124 , which suggests that the current can not pass easily through the system .",
    "when @xmath125 and the frequency becomes larger , the argument of the bessel function @xmath126 , then @xmath127 and @xmath128 , which suggests that the @xmath129 term is dominant .",
    "this case shows that the current can pass easily through the barrier under higher frequencies .",
    "it is the character of a capacitance in the usual sense .",
    "let us define @xmath130 by using the real part of the current .",
    "we have investigated the response of @xmath131 to an ac bias .",
    "it is found that tmr almost does not alter with @xmath120 and frequency @xmath132 , with the varying range about in @xmath133 @xmath134 @xmath135 . to understand this result",
    ", we would like to remark that @xmath131 is mainly contributed by the spin - dependent scatterings .",
    "when electrons from one ferromagnet enter into another whose magnetization deviates an angle to the first one , spin up and down electrons bear different potentials .",
    "while the ac field provides the same modulation of quasiparticle levels of the spin up and spin down electrons shifted by @xmath136 , leading to a change of the magnitude of the current , it affects less spin - dependent scatterings . if we impose a time - dependent magnetic field on both electrodes , it is conceivable that @xmath131 would be remarkably influenced by such an ac magnetic field .",
    "work towards this direction is now in progress .",
    "as is known , the relative orientation of magnetizations on both electrodes can affect considerably the magnitude of the electrical current flowing through the magnetic tunnel junctions , and meanwhile , the spin - polarized electrical current can also switch the direction of magnetization of electrodes .",
    "this latter effect comes from an indirect interaction between ferromagnets , which is caused by the so - coined current - induced spin - transfer torque ( cistt)@xcite . the physical meaning of the cistt can be understood as follows .",
    "when the electrons in the first ferromagnet tunnel through the barrier and enter into the right ferromagnet , the incoming polarized electrons will precess , eventually to align with the magnetization direction at an angle @xmath6 in the second ferromagnet . in this process",
    ", there should be a difference of spin angular momenta between the incoming and outgoing spins in the second ferromagnet .",
    "the missing spin angular momentum must be absorbed by the local moments , thereby generating a torque which exerts on the moments of the second ferromagnetic layer .",
    "this kind of torque reflects actually the spin angular momentum transfer from the first ferromagnet to the second by the polarized current . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have discussed the cistt by means of the nonequilibrium green function technique under an dc bias . by generalizing our treatment , we now consider the case under a simultaneous application of both ac and dc biases .",
    "the cistt is related not only to the available energy levels of both ferromagnets , but also to the direction of the current . in the ac case ,",
    "the available energy levels of ferromagnets will be shifted by absorbing or emitting photons .",
    "the tunneling can be viewed as to occur between the photonic sidebands of the left and the right ferromagnets , and the magnitude of the current can be tuned .",
    "the ac field can change the current directions by frequency @xmath137 .",
    "it may be expected that the ac field may impose considerable effect on the cistt .",
    "the total spin of the right ferromagnet can be expressed as@xcite @xmath138where @xmath139 is the pauli matrices and @xmath140 is spin states , which is written down in the @xmath141 coordinate frame while the spins @xmath142 are quantized in the @xmath143 frame , and the rotation matrix @xmath144 is the same as before . since @xmath145where @xmath146 are unit vectors @xmath147 and @xmath148 represents the respective total spin momenta per unit area of the ferromagnetsslonczewski , we know that the direction of the spin transfer torque @xmath149 is just along the @xmath150 direction in the @xmath151 coordinate frame . from eq .",
    "( totalsp ) we obtain @xmath152 where @xmath153 and @xmath154 are @xmath150- and @xmath3-components of the total spins in the @xmath151 coordinate frame in which the spins @xmath142 are quantized .",

    ", the oscillating amplitude becomes large , and when @xmath120 becomes larger , the torque is strongly suppressed .",

    "the frequency ( @xmath121 ) dependence of the time - dependent cistt at different amplitudes of the ac bias is shown in fig .",
    "it is seen that the torque oscillates with the external frequency , and it appears that the signal of the cistt is strong in some regime of @xmath121 , and is almost vanishing in other regimes .",

    "it is clear that the bessel function modulates the amplitude of the torque . from eq .",
    "( [ torcurrent ] ) , one may see that a large dc current generates a large torque . in the case under an ac bias , the electrical current might have the similar character .",
    "since the tunneling is viewed as to take place between the modulated levels of ferromagnets , the modulations lead to different transmissions , thus enabling the spin - transfer torque to exhibit various features .",

    "it can be found that small frequencies affect the time - averaged cistt dramatically , manifested explicitly by an approximately linear relation between the cistt and small @xmath121 . in comparison to fig .",
    "2 , it may be concluded that @xmath189 is proportional to the time - averaged electrical current , say @xmath190 , and the cistt can be still induced by the ac electrical current .",

    "( [ torcurrent ] ) was proposed under an dc bias@xcite . under a small ac signal ,",
    "the torque almost does not vary in higher frequencies , which is saturated with the magnitude larger than that under only a dc bias .    in above ,",
    "we have applied simultaneously both the dc and ac biases to the tunnel junction . in the presence of only an ac bias , the time - averaged cistt as a function of @xmath120 is given in fig .",
    "it is seen that the time - averaged spin transfer torque first increases sharply and then decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath120 . in other words ,",
    "the cistt takes its larger values in a narrow regime of @xmath120 .",
    "the higher the external frequency @xmath121 , the larger the maximum of the torque .",
    "this is because the spin transfer torque is related to the subtraction of two fermi functions , and the latter is very small when only an ac bias is present .",
    "the principal contribution to the result comes from a narrow regime of @xmath120 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "8 gives a plot of @xmath191 versus @xmath192 where @xmath191 is the specific value of the amplitude of the ac bias at which the peaks of the torque appear .",

    "compared to fig .",
    "6 , where the dc and ac biases are present simultaneously , the peaks in fig .",
    "8 are more sharp .",
    "these peaks can be regarded as the evidence of the photon - assisted enhancements of the cistt . in fig .",
    "6 , the averaged spin transfer torque increases slightly with increasing @xmath120 , and tends to a maximum , then decreasing rapidly .",
    "if the dc bias disappear slowly , the spin transfer torque tends to zero when @xmath120 tends to zero , while the situation in fig .",
    "this reveals that the cistt exhibits different behaviors under different biases .",
    "our results show that an ac bias could enhance the cistt at particular values of the amplitude and frequency .",
    "we have presented the calculation of the response of the electrical tunnel current and the current - induced spin transfer torque to ac and dc biases in fm - i - fm tunnel junctions by means of the time - dependent nonequilibrium green function technique . in general , when a spin - polarized current is injected into a ferromagnet , the polarized electrons may experience the fields such as the external field , the anisotropy field , the dipolar - dipolar interaction , and the demagnetization field@xcite , leading to the precession of the polarized electrons around these fields . to conserve the spin angular momentum",
    ", the magnetization also precesses around the polarized direction of the injected electrons , giving rise to a spin transfer which is quite different from a magnetic field induced by the current .",
    "the ways to realize the switching of magnetization can be either by a magnetic field , or by a magnetic field induced by the current , or by the spin transfer effect@xcite . the way through the mechanism of spin",
    "transfer offers a convenient and fast choice to switch magnetization , which could be observed from other works and our present study .    in summary",
    ", we have investigated the spin - dependent tunneling in the presence of an ac bias applied to a fm - i - fm system by considering the ac tunneling current and the ac cistt .",
    "we have formulated the time - averaged current ( time - averaged cistt ) in the form of a summation of dc current ( dc cistt ) multiplied by products of bessel functions with the energy levels shifted by @xmath0 .",
    "the tunneling current can be viewed as to happen between the photonic sidebands of the two ferromagnets .",
    "our calculation shows that low - frequency ac field suppresses the current , and the electrons may more easily tunnel through the barrier under a high - frequency ac field as the response for a capacitance in a classical case .",
    "it is found that the tmr almost does not vary with an ac bias , which suggests that the ac electric field contributes less to the spin - dependent scatterings .",
    "the current - induced spin transfer torque under an ac bias has also been investigated .",
    "it has been shown that an ac bias may overall suppress the spin transfer torque , but in a narrow regime of the ac bias , the cistt is greatly enhanced , characterized by a sharp peak which can be viewed as the photon - assisted enhancement .",
    "it has been found that the particular amplitude of the ac bias at which the cistt shows a peak has a linear relation with the frequency of the ac bias approximately . as a consequence",
    ", people could adjust the proper values of the amplitude and the frequency of the ac bias in accordance with such a linear relation to realize the enhancement of the cistt , which gives another possible option to enhance the cistt externally .",
    "in addition to using an dc current , our result might give an alternative hint to control the local moments of ferromagnets , and also to control the resistance states .",
