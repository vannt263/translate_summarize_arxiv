    "[ sec : introduction ] the construction of covariant open superstring field theory based on the rns formalism  @xcite has been a long - standing problem due to the complications coming from the concept of ` picture ' . in witten s original proposal  @xcite for cubic superstring field theory , which was the natural extension of his bosonic cubic string field theory  @xcite ,",
    "the ns string field was taken to be in the ` natural ' @xmath0-picture . however , it turned out that this theory suffered from contact - term divergences at the tree - level caused by the colliding picture - changing operators  @xcite .",
    "about 10 years later , berkovits found a way to construct a gauge - invariant ns open string field theory action without making use of the picture - changing operators  @xcite .",
    "however , it has been realized that it is impossible to include the ramond ( r ) sector string field in the action in a manifestly ten - dimensional lorentz covariant manner without introducing the picture - changing operations  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , its ten - dimensional supersymmetric structure still remains unclear .",
    "super - poincar invariance can be made manifest .",
    "and it was recently discussed how to deal with the gso(@xmath1 ) sector in the hybrid formalism  @xcite . ]    before berkovits discovery , in 1990 more conservative method of modifying witten s cubic theory had been proposed  @xcite .",
    "there , the ns string field was defined to carry picture number 0 so that the quadratic vertex had the same picture - changing operator insertion as the cubic vertex . in spite of containing the picture - changing operators in the action ,",
    "it was shown  @xcite that this theory is free from contact - term divergence problems . with the help of picture - changing operators , we are able not only to include the r sector string field of picture number @xmath2 in a ten - dimensional lorentz covariant manner , but also to construct the @xmath3 , @xmath4 spacetime supersymmetry generator . however , a subtle problem regarding the picture - changing operator still remains : the linearized equation of motion @xmath5 for the ns string field can differ from the usual one @xmath6 because @xmath7 has a non - trivial kernel .",
    "but since the picture - changing operator is inserted at the open string midpoint ( @xmath8 in the uhp representation ) , @xmath5 gives the same result as @xmath6 as long as @xmath9 is restricted to being in the _",
    "finite_-dimensional fock space .",
    "hence it is conceivable that the level truncation procedure provides an _ ad hoc _ way of regularizing the problem of non - trivial kernel of @xmath7 , although the explicit truncation of the states in the kernel of @xmath7 in the _ full _ theory would ruin the associativity of the @xmath10-product  ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "one of the aims of this paper is to see to what extent the level - truncated modified cubic superstring field theory can reproduce the structure expected of open superstring theory : action for the low - lying fields , open string tachyon condensation , etc .",
    "this work is also motivated by the desire to investigate the proposed form of vacuum superstring field theory  @xcite within the level truncation scheme , because no exact d - brane solutions have been found in this theory so far .",
    "besides , we have found that there have been very few reports on how the reality of the action is guaranteed by imposing appropriate conditions on the string fields . we will answer this question using the cft method for all three proposals for superstring field theory .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : massless ] we calculate the cubic superstring field theory action for the ns(@xmath11 ) massless sector , and show that , even though the @xmath12 term is absent , the correct maxwell lagrangian can be reproduced after integrating out the auxiliary fields . in section",
    "[ sec : gso- ] we discuss how to include the ns(@xmath1 ) states in the action , paying attention to the problem of fixing sign ambiguities .",
    "section  [ sec : reality ] is devoted to the discussion about the reality conditions on the string fields .",
    "in section  [ sec : tachyonpotential ] we re - examine the non - trivial vacuum solutions previously obtained in the non  gso - projected  @xcite and gso - projected  @xcite theories in the level truncation scheme , and present a ( new ) space - dependent kink solution of codimension 1 on a non - bps d - brane at the lowest level . in section  [ sec :",
    "vsftsolutions ] we perform the level - truncation analysis in vacuum superstring field theory .",
    "we summarize our results in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the explicit expressions for the component action and technical remarks about the computations involving @xmath13 are collected in appendices .",
    "[ sec : massless ] we begin with the detailed study of how the massless gauge field , which belongs to the ns(@xmath11 ) sector , is described in the modified cubic superstring field theory .",
    "some results have already been shown in the literature  @xcite , but since we are using different conventions from theirs , we will explicitly write them down",
    ". the action for the ns(@xmath11 ) string field @xmath14 is given by  @xcite @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the open string coupling constant and the 2- and 3-string vertices are defined as the following correlation functions on the upper half plane , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the inverse picture - changing operator ] as @xmath7 , instead of the ` non - chiral ' choice @xmath19 .",
    "however , it is known that the cubic theory with @xmath20 has some problematic features : for example , the massless part of the free action does not reproduce the conventional maxwell action  @xcite , and the insertion of @xmath20 breaks the twist symmetry of the string field theory action  @xcite while @xmath19 preserves it .",
    "we will therefore focus on the non - chiral choice in this paper . ] and @xmath21 denotes the conformal transform of the vertex operator @xmath22 by the conformal map @xmath23 . concretely , for a primary field @xmath9 of conformal weight @xmath24 we have @xmath25 .",
    "the conformal maps appearing in eqs.([eq : zb ] ) , ( [ eq : zc ] ) are @xmath26 with @xmath27 the correlation function is normalized as @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the volume of the @xmath30-dimensional spacetime .",
    "the brst operator @xmath31 is nilpotent and acts as a graded derivation in the @xmath10-algebra .",
    "the picture - changing operator @xmath7 is brst - invariant in the sense that @xmath32=\\oint\\frac{dz}{2\\pi i}j_b(z)y(i)y(-i)=0 $ ] .",
    "the 3-string vertex , as well as the @xmath33-string vertices induced from the repeated use of the @xmath10-multiplication , satisfies the cyclicity relation @xmath34 it then follows that the action  ( [ eq : za ] ) is invariant under the gauge transformation @xmath35 where @xmath36 is an infinitesimal gauge transformation parameter .",
    "it is important to decide whether the overall multiplicative factor in front of the action  ( [ eq : za ] ) should be positive or negative , because it can not be absorbed by the redefinition of the _ real _ string field .",
    "we can not answer this question at this point , and it should be determined by looking at the sign of the kinetic term of the physical component field , as will be done .    for the superconformal ghost sector , we will entirely be working in the ` fermionized ' language ghosts , because this cubic theory is formulated within the  small \" hilbert space ( namely , without introducing the zero mode of @xmath37 ) . for example , the inverse picture - changing operator can be written as @xmath38 , with @xmath39 satisfying the property @xmath40 . ] without referring to the original bosonic @xmath41-ghost system .",
    "but we would like to make a remark on the fermionization formula here . @xmath42 and @xmath43 are fermionized as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 ,   @xmath47 . since @xmath48 is an operator that counts the number ( mod 2 ) of the world - sheet fermions @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 _ anticommutes with them .",
    "_ thus @xmath52 is considered as a cocycle factor attached to @xmath53 such that @xmath54 anticommutes with the world - sheet fermions as a whole .",
    "the existence of this cocycle factor is important because , if it were absent , the statistics of @xmath43 and that of @xmath55 would not agree . from the ope @xmath56 one finds that @xmath57 and @xmath58 naturally anticommute with each other when both @xmath59 and @xmath60 are odd integers .",
    "after all , we have found that @xmath61 with odd @xmath62 anticommutes with all of the fermions and @xmath63 with odd @xmath64 , whereas @xmath61 with even @xmath65 commutes with everything because @xmath66 in the ns sector is always an even integer .",
    "therefore , we can abbreviate @xmath61 to @xmath67 , with the understanding that @xmath67 should be treated as a fermion / boson when @xmath62 is odd / even , respectively .",
    "in fact , it appears that almost all the calculations in the literature have been performed using this ` abbreviation rule ' .",
    "also in the rest of this paper we will simply regard @xmath67 with odd @xmath62 as fermionic , instead of explicitly writing the cocycle factor @xmath68 .",
