    "the new technique of gravitational microlensing has developed rapidly since its introduction to astronomy in 1993 . during that year the macho group in australia , and the eros and ogle groups in chile , made the first observations ( alcock et al .",
    "1993 ; aubourg et al .",
    "1993 ; udalski et al .",
    "all three groups observed the apparent brightening of a distant star caused by the lens - like effect of a closer , collinear star , as had been predicted by einstein ( 1936 ) .",
    "the brightening was found to follow the characteristic achromatic light curve calculated by paczynski ( 1986 ) as the stars moved into , and out of , collinearity .",
    "paczynski had proposed using the technique to search for brown dwarfs in the dark halo of the galaxy through their lensing effect on stars in the magellanic clouds .",
    "subsequently , other uses for the technique were proposed , including studies of galactic structure , stellar spectra , stellar atmospheres and extra - solar planets .",
    "other groups were formed to exploit these applications , some with telescopes in australasia .    in this paper ,",
    "the main observations that have been carried out from australasia to date are described . a proposal to include antarctica as an observing site in the future",
    "is also described . for the most part the content follows an invited talk given by the author to the joint meeting of the astronomical society of australia and the royal astronomical society of new zealand that was held at sydney in july 1999 .",
    "the observations from australasia have been made by groups known as macho , gman , planet , mps , and moa .",
    "all the fields mentioned above have been studied , viz .",
    "dark matter , galactic structure , stellar spectra , stellar atmospheres and extra - solar planets .",
    "these are dealt with in turn in the paper .",
    "most of the groups mentioned above maintain web sites on their work .",

    "the field of gravitational lensing as a whole , including its history dating back to 1804 , was comprehensively reviewed recently by wambsganss at _",
    "http://www.livingreviews.org / articles / volume1/1998 - 12wamb / index.html_.",
    "the study of dark matter , and in particular brown dwarfs , was the first application of the gravitational microlensing technqiue to be proposed , and it motivated the early observations by the pioneering groups in the field , viz .",
    "macho , eros and ogle .",
    "the technique is particularly suited to the study of brown dwarfs or similar dark objects because it does not rely on optical detection .",
    "paczynski ( 1986 ) showed that , if the galactic halo is composed of brown dwarfs , then approximately one star in a million in the magellanic clouds would be lensed at any one time by a brown dwarf for a duration @xmath2 days . here",
    "@xmath3 denotes the mass of the brown dwarf , which is @xmath4 .",
    "hence the expected duration for these lensing events is @xmath140 days or less .",
    "the macho group has now monitored several million stars in the magellanic clouds for several years . amongst their database of lmc stars to 1997 , no events were found with duration less than 20 days .",
    "a similar result was obtained by the eros group working from chile .",
    "these results were combined to yield a @xmath5 confidence upper limit @xmath6 on the halo - mass - fraction of low - mass brown dwarfs with masses in the range @xmath7 ( alcock et al .",
    "this result eliminates low - mass brown dwarfs , planets that have been ejected from planetary systems , and any other compact non - luminous objects in the stated mass range as a significant component of halo dark matter for standard models of the halo .",
    "the macho and eros groups extended their searches to include events of longer duration corresponding to brown dwarfs and other non - luminous objects with masses in the range @xmath8 .",
    "the eros group did not detect any events caused by halo objects in this mass range in the direction of the smc ( afonso et al .",
    "the macho group has , however , recorded several events in this mass range in their database towards the lmc , corresponding to a halo fraction of @xmath9 of objects with mass @xmath10 ( alcock et al .",
    "the result , which is marginally consistent with the above result of the eros group , was generally unexpected .",
    "it has proven difficult to interpret .",
    "the above results are shown collectively in figure 1 .",
    "this figure also includes data from gilmore and unavane ( 1998 ) and the moa group ( abe et al .",
    "1999 ) that were obtained by surface photometry of external galaxies .",
    "the surface photometry data apply to main - sequence stars , i.e. to red dwarfs .",
    "similarly restrictive limits on the abundance of red dwarfs in the galactic halo have been obtained from studies of the hubble deep field ( graff & freese 1996 ; flynn , gould & bahcall 1996 ) .",
    "it is clear that the objects being detected by the macho group can not be red dwarfs .",
    "two interpretations of the data have been proposed .",
    "the first assumes a halo comprised mainly of old white dwarfs ( alcock et al .",
    "1997a ) or of primordial black holes ( nakamura 1998 ) .",
    "the white dwarf hypothesis requires the initial mass function to be strongly peaked at @xmath11 , to enable the white dwarfs to cool sufficiently to escape detection in other surveys ( chabrier et al .",
    "1996 ) , and it leaves unexplained the metal enrichment that would be expected to accompany them ( gibson and mould 1997 ) .",
    "the primordial black hole hypothesis requires their mass function to be peaked at @xmath10 , surprisingly close to the mass of a normal star .",
    "both these interpretations may be tested in the future by independent observations .",
    "direct observations of white dwarfs should be possible if they are a major component of the halo ( chabrier 1999 ) , and gravitational mergers of primordial black holes may be detectable if primordial black holes are a major component ( nakamura 1998 ) .",
    "the second type of interpretation that has been proposed for the macho events has potential implications for galactic structure .",
    "sahu ( 1994 ) proposed that foreground stars in the lmc may lens background stars in the lmc , a process known as self lensing. initially , the expected event rate for self - lensing was expected to be too low to account for the observations ( gould 1995a ) .",
    "however , examples of self - lensing were subsequently detected ( see section 5.2 below ) , and these lend weight to sahu s hypothesis . modified",
    "models of the lmc have been proposed that may accommodate a high self - lensing rate ( aubourg et al .",
    "1999 ; salati et al . 1999 ; weinberg 1999 ) , and methods have been proposed to test such models ( zhao 1999a , 1999b , 1999c ) . in a related proposal , evans et al .",
    "( 1998 ) proposed significant flaring and/or warping of the disk of the milky way to account for the macho events , a possibility that may also be tested by direct observation .    in summary ,",
    "the microlensing experiments have shown conclusively that galactic dark matter is not comprised of brown dwarfs .",
    "not all the data that have been obtained to date have been explained yet .",
    "possibilities have been proposed , including old white dwarfs , primordial black holes , or modifications to current models of galactic structure .",
    "these may all be tested through independent observations .",
    "the ogle and macho groups included the galactic bulge in their original targets for gravitational microlensing .",
    "both groups reported a significantly higher event rate for microlensing than was expected ( udalski et al .",
    "1994 ; alcock et al .",
    "1995 ) . the high rate can be explained by assuming the galactic bulge is bar shaped ( zhao , rich & spergel 1996 ) . in this model , stars from the near side of the bar lens stars from the far side . supporting evidence for the model",
    "was obtained by the ogle group who observed a systematic trend in the apparent magnitudes of red clump stars across the bulge ( stanek et al .",
    "these authors found that the microlensing and red clump data can be jointly fitted by a bar inclined at @xmath12 to our line of sight .",
    "these results are consistent with earlier hints of a barred structure ( e.g. blitz & spergel 1991 ) .",
    "a beautiful application of gravitational microlensing uses the amplification of the effect to effectively increase the size of a telescope to carry out observations of faint objects that would otherwise be impossible .",
    "the feasibility of this application has been ably demonstrated by lennon et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) and by members of the macho group ( minniti et al .",
    "minniti et al . measured the abundance of the rare element lithium in a main sequence bulge star using keck i when the star was magnified by @xmath11 magnitude , thereby effectively converting the diameter of the telescope to 15 m .",
    "the microlensing event that was used for this application was macho-97-blg-45 , the forty - fifth event found towards the galactic bulge during 1997 by the macho group .",
    "this application of gravitational microlensing utilises the achromaticity of the effect , and also the predictability of the time of peak amplification once an event has commenced .",
    "the latter feature allows the requisite telescope scheduling to be readily carried out .",
    "the above lithium abundance measurement would not have been possible using conventional techniques and existing telescopes .",
    "further such measurements are expected to determine the chemical composition and enrichment history of the bulge .",
    "the study of stellar atmospheres by the gravitational microlensing provides an interesting application of the technique .",
    "two methods are possible . examples of each are given below .      during july 1995",
    "the macho group reported a microlensing event in progress with unusual properties .",
    "the star being lensed was a red giant , and the lens trajectory was predicted to transit it .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic observations of the event were requested from several locations , and these were carried out ( alcock et al 1997b ) .",
    "the light curve for the event is shown in figures 2 and 3 .",
    "these include data from australia , chile , israel and new zealand .",
    "the above data for event macho-95-blg-30 clearly show the effect of the finite size of the source star . as the lens transits the face of the source star , different parts of it",
    "are preferentially amplified .",
    "limb darkening and stellar spots on the source star may then be detected ( heyrovsky , sasselov & loeb 1999 ) . for event macho-1995-blg-30",
    "an improved fit to the data was in fact obtained with a limb darkened model of the star .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 .",
    "spectra taken during the event , shown in figure 4 , also showed some variation as the lens transited the source star .",
    "these are presently being analysed for the purpose of constructing a model atmosphere of the source star in this event ( heyrovsky & sasselov 1999 ) .",
    "this event illustrates the second technique by which stellar atmospheres may be probed using gravitational microlensing .",
    "macho-98-smc-1 was monitored by several groups including the planet group ( albrow et al .",
    "this group operates the network of telescopes shown in figure 5 .",
    "it enables almost continuous surveillance around the clock , weather permitting , of microlensing events .",
    "the lens for macho-98-smc-1 was a binary star .",
    "binary lenses can produce light curves that differ markedly from the single peaked structure shown in figure 2 for a single lens .",
    "figure 6 shows the light curve obtained by the planet group for macho-98-smc-1 .",
    "the asymptotic peaks occur when the source star crosses a caustic. this is a linear region formed by the binary lens where the amplification is formally infinite ( alcock et al .",
    "the shape of the caustic determined by the planet group for macho-98-smc-1 is shown in figure 7 .",
    "the formally infinite amplification at a caustic is suppressed by the finite size of the source star . as the caustic sweeps across the face of the source star , different regions are preferentially amplified .",
    "this has two consequences .",
    "first , the crossing time can be measured and used to constrain the geometry of the event .",
    "second , limb darkening in the source star can be detected .",
    "the first of these goals was achieved by the planet group for macho-98-smc-1 .",
    "they found a crossing time of @xmath1 4.25 hr for the event , implying the lens was in the smc ( albrow et al .",
    "the event was an example of the so - called self - lensing process described in section 2 , and the lens was not in the galactic halo .    by combining",
    "the planet data for macho-98-smc-1 with data from the eros , macho , gman and mps groups , a detection of limb darkening for the source star in five passbands ranging from i to v was obtained ( afonso et al .",
    "spectroscopy and photometry of the source star yielded an a6 dwarf classification .",
    "thus , in this instance , limb darkening on a dwarf star some 60 kpc distant was detected !",
    "this highlights the extraordinary capability of the microlensing technique . because the source star for this event was in the smc , it is likely to be metal - poor .",
    "this represents the first measurement of limb darkening of an a type metal - poor star .",
    "the study of extra - solar planetary systems is one of the more intriguing applications of the gravitational microlensing technique .",
    "this application was first proposed by mao and paczynski ( 1991 ) .",
    "several refinements have since been discussed ( gould & loeb 1992 ; bennett & rhie 1996 ; gaudi & gould 1997 ; wambsgnass 1997 ; griest & safizadeh 1998 ; gaudi , naber & sackett 1998 ; di stefano & scalzo 1999 ) . the technique may be likened to rutherford s experiment on atomic structure as shown in figure 8 . whereas rutherford used @xmath13 particles",
    "to probe atomic structure , gravitational microlensers use photons to probe planetary structure , by searching for deviations from the light curve produced by a single lens .",
    "the technique is promising because , as is indicated in the figure , a typical impact parameter in a microlensing event is a few au .",
    "in contrast , the complementary doppler technique enjoys greatest sensitivity for planets at orbital radii @xmath141 au ( marcy & butler 1998 ) .",
    "applications of the microlensing technique by the planet , moa and mps groups to events ogle-98-blg-14 , macho-98-blg-35 and macho-97-blg-41 respectively are described below .",
    "the planet group made approximately 400 observations of ogle-98-blg-14 over a period of @xmath15 days ( sackett 1999 ) .",
    "the resulting light curve did not differ obviously from that of a single lens .",
    "a comparison was made between the observed light curve and the expected light curves for lenses with and without planets to place constraints on possible planets orbiting the lens star .",
    "the results are most easily expressed in terms of the einstein radius @xmath16 for the event , and the planet - to - star mass ratio @xmath17 . for bulge events",
    "is @xmath1 a few au , although it is generally not known precisely on an event - by - event basis . ]",
    "it was found that planets with @xmath18 and orbital radii in the range ( 0.7 - 1.2)@xmath16 could be excluded with 100% confidence , and that planets with @xmath18 and orbital radii ( 0.6 - 1.5)@xmath16 could be excluded with 75% confidence ( sackett 1999 ) .",
    "these results strongly restrict the possible presence of jupiter - like planets orbiting the lens star .",
    "a significant refinement to the original proposal for planet hunting by mao and paczynski ( 1991 ) was made by griest and safizadeh ( 1998 ) .",
    "they found that in microlensing events with high peak amplification , @xmath19 , a planet always perturbs the light curve near its peak .",
    "the calculated perturbation was found to be detectable with essentially 100% probability for jupiter - like planets , and , depending on the geometry of the event , detectable with finite probability for lighter planets .",
    "because the time of peak magnification of a microlensing event is generally known in advance , the finding by griest and safizadeh appeared to offer a systematic strategy for detecting planets .",
    "an opportunity arose to test the above strategy with event macho-98-blg-35 .",
    "this reached a peak magnification @xmath20 .",
    "the peak of the event was monitored by the mps and moa groups ( rhie et al .",
    "their light curves are shown in figure 9 .",
    "these include the best fit to the data assuming a lens with and without a planet .",
    "the parameters for the best fit with a planet were obtained with a planet mass ratio @xmath21 and an orbit radius of @xmath22 . assuming a typical value for the lens mass @xmath23",
    ", these parameters correspond to a planet with mass between about that of earth and about twice that of neptune at an orbit radius of a few au .",
    "the formal significance of the detection is at the @xmath24 level .",
    "figure 10 shows the same data as figure 9 but plotted as a ratio to the best fit single lens light curve .",
    "11 shows exclusion regions , at the @xmath25 confidence level , for planets with various masses .",
    "jupiter - like and saturn - like planets are excluded with quite high confidence .",
    "peale ( 1997 ) has proposed the existence of planetary systems in which jupiter and saturn are replaced with neptune - like planets .",
    "it is possible that this observation represents the first detection of such a system .",
    "the planet collaboration did not monitor macho-98-blg-35 very frequently near its peak ( see planet homepage - section 1 ) .",
    "such monitoring could have assisted greatly to check the above interpretation of the event . as a check on the quality of the moa and mps data",
    "we include here ( figures 12 and 13 ) the light curves by moa of nearby stars of similar colour , crowdedness and magnitude as macho-98-blg-35 , and in figure 14 the mps data as a function of air - mass .",
    "this event was monitored by the macho and gman groups quite extensively .",
    "they found that single - lens and binary - lens models could not reproduce the data ( alcock et al .",
    "the event was also observed by the mps group in association with a wise observatory team ( bennett et al .",
    "they have reported a model of the event in which the lens appears to be successfully treated as a planet orbiting a binary star . according to this model",
    ", the mass ratio of the binary star system is 3.8:1 and the stars are most likely to be a late k dwarf and an m dwarf with a separation of about 1.8 au .",
    "a planet of about 3 jupiter masses orbits this system at a distance of about 7 au .",
    "the above result is the first detection of a giant planet by the gravitational microlensing technique .",
    "it suggests that such planets may be common in short period binary systems .",
    "further data by other groups are available for the event that were not included in the above modeling",
    ". it will be interesting to see if a global analysis can pin down the parameters of the system more tightly . in any case , the above result signifies a major development in planetary science , whilst further highlighting the potential of the gravitational microlensing technique .",
    "to realise the full potential of the gravitational microlensing technique it is necessary to monitor millions of stars with good photometric accuracy at a sampling rate of a few observations per hour in several passbands .",
    "the existing network of southern survey and follow - up telescopes ( macho , ogle , eros , gman , planet , mps and moa ) do a relatively good job of monitoring the galactic bulge and the magellanic clouds .",
    "further improvement may be expected to occur soon as new image subtraction techniques with better photometric accuracy are refined and incorporated ( alard & lupton 1998 ; alard 1999 ) .    a quantum leap might be realised with a telescope at the antarctic . the idea has been raised before ( sahu 1998 ; muraki et al .",
    "such a telescope could monitor southern fields essentially continuously , thus avoiding the not inconsiderable difficulties associated with combining data from different groups using different telescopes and different passbands , and working under different seeing conditions .",
    "losses of data due to inclement weather would also be less serious . to monitor the complete peak of a typical high magnification event from the antarctic would require good weather for a few days in one location only . presently , good weather is required simultaneously in chile , in australasia and in south africa . by observing in the infrared , and taking advantage of the exceptionally dry conditions at the antarctic , one could extend the present measurements to include the centre of the galaxy .",
    "gould has pointed out this would increase the total event rate ( gould 1995b ) .",
    "a 2-m class telescope would be the preferred option to extend the current observations being made with 1-m class instruments .    us and",
    "australian groups have already made considerable progress towards the development of the antarctic for infrared astronomy ( burton 1996 ) .",
    "observations have been made from the south pole which confirm its excellent characteristics at infrared wavelengths , and site - testing is in progress at dome - c ( see figure 15 ) which promises to be even superior ( burton 1999 ) . in view of the above",
    ", dome - c would seem to be a promising site for future development of gravitational microlensing .",
    "gravitational microlensing is a useful technique in astronomy .",
    "several new results have been obtained using the technique , including @xmath26 many of these results were enabled by data from the original survey groups , macho , ogle and eros , being made widely accessible . in the future , the antarctic offers a promising site for extending the technique .",
