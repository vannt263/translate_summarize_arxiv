    "in this paper we present a method to achieve any point on the  dominant \" face of the slepian  wolf ( sw ) achievable rate region using polar codes for the case of sources with _ uniform _ marginals .",
    "sw coding @xcite refers to the distributed compression of a memoryless source pair @xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "the problem setting assumes separate encoding but joint decoding of sources @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the surprising result of the sw theorem states that a total rate @xmath4 is sufficient even with separate encoding . in this work",
    "we assume @xmath5 is a distribution on @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a pair of @xmath9-vectors obtained by repeated independent drawings of source pair @xmath0 .",
    "then , @xmath2-encoder performs the mapping @xmath10 and @xmath3-encoder performs the mapping @xmath11 .",
    "the decoder observing both of the sequences performs the mapping @xmath12 . as @xmath13",
    ", such mappings with vanishingly small decoding error probability exist if rate pair @xmath14 is inside the _ achievable rate region _",
    "( sw rate region ) described by the inequalities @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the corner points @xmath18 and @xmath19 on the achievable rate boundary are also referred to as  asymmetric \" operating points . and",
    "any point on the line segment between these corner points (  dominant \" face ) , where @xmath20 , is also referred to as a  nonasymmetric \" operating point .    in the past decade , starting with the pioneering work of pradhan and ramchandran @xcite , an extensive literature on applying channel codes for practical implementation of sw coding has been developed .",
    "schemes utilizing turbo and ldpc codes in both asymmetric @xcite and nonasymmetric @xcite sw problems were constructed . also , ",
    "flexible rate \" schemes using ldpc @xcite and turbo @xcite codes were devised .",
    "a flexible rate code refers to a sw coding scheme which has means to vary its total rate without much performance loss .",
    "the nonasymmetric schemes in @xcite are based on  channel code partitioning \" idea introduced in @xcite .",
    "a single channel code generator matrix is partitioned into two to be used by @xmath2 and @xmath3 encoders .",
    "the partition is done in such a way that the desired rate allocation is achieved .",
    "another method to achieve nonasymmetric rate allocation was introduced in @xcite .",
    "it uses the same channel code for both encoders .",
    "it is the method used in this paper and its details are given in section [ sec : nsw ] .",
    "polar coding @xcite , recently discovered by arkan , is the first provably capacity  achieving coding method with low encoding and decoding complexity for the class of binary  input discrete memoryless channels . shortly after its discovery ,",
    "a number of work has been published which showed that polar codes are also provably optimal for source coding , _ asymmetric _ slepian  wolf and wyner  ziv problems @xcite .",
    "our main contribution in this work is to devise a simple practical _ nonasymmetric _ sw scheme using polar codes for the case of sources with _ uniform _",
    "marginals by utilizing the framework of @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we briefly discuss how to use polar encoder / sc decoder pair in practical asymmetric sw and single source compression settings .",
    "then , we proceed to describing how to apply the framework of @xcite on polar codes to achieve nonasymmetric sw coding of _ uniform _ sources .",
    "lastly , we present simulation results that exhibit the performance of the considered schemes .",
    "we use sc list ( scl ) decoder @xcite with crc to achieve the best possible results .",
    "the method of adding a simple crc to information bits and using the scl decoder in conjunction with this crc was proposed by the authors of @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this method is that it improves the performance for short to moderate block lengths with almost no extra complexity .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with polar codes , especially the concepts in @xcite .",
    "the notations used for vectors and matrices are similar to those in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in this work , the marginals of both sources @xmath2 and @xmath3 are assumed to be uniform .",
    "let @xmath21 , where @xmath22 ber@xmath23 .",
    "in other words , @xmath3 is the corrupted version of @xmath2 by a bsc(@xmath24 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the binary entropy function @xmath27 . for asymmetric sw setting , side information ( si ) @xmath28 is assumed to be present at the decoder error  free .",
    "then , this setting is actually not much different than a channel decoding problem . given the observation @xmath28 , which is a corrupted version of @xmath29 by a bsc(@xmath24 ) , it is nothing but a channel decoding problem to recover @xmath29 .",
    "the only difference compared to a usual channel decoding is that the coset in which the search to be performed is not the zero syndrome one but given by the syndrome of @xmath29 .",
    "thus , the compression operation is nothing but calculating the syndrome @xmath30 of @xmath29 .",
    "one major advantage of polar codes is that this nonstandard decoding is readily implemented with a sc decoder @xcite .",
    "+    a polar code is identified by a parameter set @xmath31 , where @xmath9 is the block length , @xmath32 is the code dimension , @xmath33 is the information set of size @xmath32 and @xmath34 is the frozen bits vector of size @xmath35 .",
    "the frozen bits @xmath36 identify a coset of the linear block code with generator matrix @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "@xmath37 denotes the submatrix of @xmath38 formed by the rows with indices in @xmath33 .",
    "therefore , a parity check matrix can be found so that @xmath36 is the syndrome of this code . since @xmath39 ,",
    "the syndrome calculation is just a polar encoding operation followed by extracting the bits corresponding to the frozen indices : @xmath40    the encoding and decoding operations are summarized in [ fig : single ] .",
    "encoding realizes the operation defined in .",
    "decoding is done using the scl decoder which outputs estimates of both @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 is the estimate of the uncompressed bit sequence . ",
    "llr calculation \" block calculates the llrs according to the _ assumed _ correlation between sources @xmath2 and @xmath3 , which is a bsc(@xmath24 ) : @xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes the length of crc bits , if any .",
    "crc is used in conjuction with scl decoder to increase performance .",
    "if it is used , the length of information block is reduced to @xmath46 .",
    "note that in , while the statistics of the first @xmath47 bits are known @xmath48 and used for decoding , the statistics of the crc bits are assumed to be uniform .    for single source compression ,",
    "the si vector @xmath28 is replaced with all  zeros vector @xmath49 at the input of the decoder .",
    "a method to construct nonasymmetric sw scheme from a single channel code for the case of _ uniformly _ distributed sources using syndrome approach was proposed in @xcite .",
    "this method was recently used in @xcite to construct a both nonasymmetric and rate ",
    "compatible sw scheme using turbo codes . in this section ,",
    "we apply the method of @xcite to construct a nonasymmetric sw setting using polar codes .",
    "the method of @xcite can be summarized as follows .",
    "consider two uniform i.i.d . distributed and correlated @xmath9vectors @xmath50 $ ] and @xmath51 $ ] , where @xmath52 represents the first @xmath32 bits and @xmath53 represents the last @xmath35 bits of vector @xmath41 ( the same applies to @xmath54 ) .",
    "also , let @xmath55 $ ] and @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "@xmath57 represents the first @xmath58 bits and @xmath59 represents the last @xmath60 bits of @xmath52 ( the same applies to @xmath61 ) , where @xmath62 .",
    "let @xmath63 be @xmath64 generator matrix and @xmath65 $ ] be @xmath66 parity check matrix of the channel code .",
    "also assume that @xmath67 is @xmath68 submatrix and @xmath69 is @xmath70 submatrix of @xmath71 such that @xmath69 is selected as nonsingular .",
    "notice that the systematic version of a code is a special case with @xmath72 .",
    "the syndromes of @xmath41 and @xmath54 are calculated as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively .",
    "then , @xmath2encoder sends @xmath75 and @xmath3encoder sends @xmath76 .",
    "the information sent by both encoders are marked with the shaded regions in [ fig : nonasym1 ] . by varying @xmath58 ( keeping @xmath77 at constant ) different points on the sw rate region",
    "can be reached . since",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are assumed to be uniform i.i.d .",
    "sources , @xmath78 .",
    "then , the code is adjusted so that @xmath79 .",
    "thus , the total rate stays above entropy bound : @xmath80=(k_1+(n - k))+(k_2+(n - k ) ) \\\\",
    "nr&=n + ( n - k ) \\geq n[h(y ) + h(x|y ) ] =",
    "n h(x , y).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the decoding of the above scheme , which is depicted in [ fig : nonasym2 ] , is done as follows .",
    "let @xmath81 be the error vector .",
    "then , @xmath82 .",
    "the channel decoder is supplied with all  zeros vector as input and @xmath83 as the coset index .",
    "the estimate @xmath84 is obtained as the output . with this estimated error pattern , @xmath59 and @xmath85 can be recovered using @xmath86 and @xmath57 , respectively .",
    "finally , @xmath53 and @xmath87 are obtained as @xmath88 note that , although it is not shown explicitly in [ fig : nonasym2 ] , likelihood calculation of the the all  zeros vector input to the decoder is done using the crossover parameter @xmath24 of the virtual bsc between sources @xmath2 and @xmath3 as given in .",
    "now , this method can not be applied to the standard form of polar codes in @xcite .",
    "however , the systematic version of polar codes @xcite which was introduced recently can be used .",
    "the systematic polar coding is defined as follows .",
    "the codeword @xmath41 is split into two parts @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is a subset of @xmath91 such that @xmath92 and submatrix @xmath93 is invertible .",
    "@xmath93 consists of the array of elements @xmath94 with @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "then , the  systematic \" and  parity \" part of the codeword @xmath41 can be written as @xmath97 respectively .",
    "the difference of this definition compared to a usual systematic code definition is that the systematic bits do not constitute the first @xmath32 bits of the codeword @xmath41 but rather a different subset of locations identified by the index set @xmath90 .",
    "now with the above definitions , a systematic encoder defined with parameter @xmath98 can implement the mapping @xmath99 by computing @xmath100 and then inserting @xmath101 into to obtain @xmath102 .",
    "now returning back to the nonasymmetric sw method of @xcite described above , we set @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 . this way we fulfill the requirements of the method such that when @xmath52 is decoded using the estimated error vector @xmath84 , the rest , @xmath53 , can be recovered from @xmath52 and @xmath106 .",
    "given @xmath107 and @xmath105 , computing @xmath104 and @xmath101 is nothing but a systematic polar encoding operation summarized above . and it can be done efficiently using a sc polar decoder @xcite . for the standard form of polar codes defined in @xcite ,",
    "the index set @xmath90 can be selected as the permuted version of @xmath33 .",
    "this permutation corresponds to the _ bit - reversal _ operation .",
    "the use of crc with this nonasymmetric scheme is also possible . for both sources ,",
    "@xmath46 length information blocks are completed to @xmath9 with @xmath45 bits of crc . since",
    "crc operation is linear , the crc of error vector @xmath81 must also check .",
    "thus , the scl channel decoder can use this information when estimating the error vector .",
    "in this section , we present simulation results on performances of the source coding methods discussed . the correlation model between sources @xmath2 and @xmath3",
    "is given as @xmath108 , where @xmath109 .",
    "in all of the plots , the rates of codes are kept at a defined constant value while @xmath24 is varied to achieve different @xmath110 points .",
    "for all of the sw schemes the plotted ber corresponds to the averaged value over @xmath2 and @xmath3 sources .",
    "the polar decoder used is the scl decoder of @xcite . to improve the performance , a 16-bit crc ( ccitt ) is added .",
    "the list decoder selects the output from the final list with the aid of crc .",
    "note that , for source coding , crc is appended to the  codeword \" vector @xmath41 as opposed to channel coding case where it is appended to  information \" vector @xmath101 .",
    "the list size is set to 32 for all cases .",
    "the code construction is done via the method proposed in @xcite and optimized to @xmath111 for @xmath112 , @xmath113 for @xmath114 and @xmath115 for @xmath116 .        as it is pointed out in section [ sec : ssc_asw ] , single source coding can be considered as a special case of asymmetric sw coding .",
    "single source compression of an i.i.d .",
    "source @xmath2 with @xmath117 and asymmetric sw coding of i.i.d .",
    "pair @xmath0 with uniform marginals and @xmath25 are essentially the same .",
    "therefore , their simulation performances come out to be identical , as expected . in [ fig : sim : asw ] , ber curves of asymmetric sw setting for @xmath118 are shown . results for different code block lengths and rate values are given in table [ tab : asw ] .",
    "the values in the table show the entropy of source correlation @xmath119 when a ber of @xmath120 is achieved .",
    "for example , the gap to sw bound for @xmath118 and @xmath121 is 0.056 .",
