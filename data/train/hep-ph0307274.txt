    "the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) describes the forces between quarks which are elementary blocks of hadrons .",
    "in contrast with quantum electrodynamics qcd has a very strong interaction between quanta of gauge fields .",
    "probably the consequences of such nonlinearity is the appearance of a flux tube filled with a longitudinal color electric field between interacting quark and antiquark .",
    "the existence of such tube leads to a confinement of quarks : quark and antiquark are connected with the flux tube which gives a constant force between these particles .",
    "the quarks are the sources of a color electric field filling the flux tube .",
    "therefore the derivation of the flux tube solutions in qcd is very important problem . evidently this problem is quantum not classical one as many years of the attempts to obtain such solutions in the classical gauge theories have not any success .",
    "altough it is well known that in dual theories exist so - called nielsen - olesen flux tube solutions @xcite which are filled with an abelian magnetic field and bps strings @xcite .",
    "mathematically these solutions are identical to the flux tubes in a superconductor where the magnetic field is pushed out from the superconductor .",
    "such correspondence between color flux tube in qcd and magnetic flux tube in superconductor allows us to suppose that the qcd flux tube in some sense is a dual picture of a meissner effect in the superconductivity @xcite , @xcite : magnetic field is changed on electric one and a condensate of cooper pairs on a condensate of ( probably ) magnetic monopoles .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that in the euclidean spacetime there is a flux tube solution ( colored flux tube ) of the su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs gauge theory with broken gauge symmetry .",
    "the derived solution is filled with a color longitudinal su(2 ) electric field .",
    "the analysis shows that the symmetry breakdown is necessary for the existence of colored flux tube as this solution is regular only for a discrete spectrum of mass @xmath0 which describes the gauge symmetry breakdown . in this letter",
    "we would like to show that the same mechanism is in the action for the lorentzian spacetime , too .",
    "we will start from the su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs field equations with broken gauge symmetry @xmath1 here @xmath2 is the field tensor for the su(2 ) gauge potential @xmath3 ; @xmath4 are the color indices ; @xmath5^a = \\partial_\\nu [ \\cdots ] ^a +   g \\epsilon^{abc } a^b_\\mu   [ \\cdots ] ^c$ ] is the gauge derivative ; @xmath6 is the higgs field ; @xmath7 and @xmath8 are some constants ; @xmath9 is a masses matrix which destroys the gauge invariance of the yang - mills - higgs theory , here we choose @xmath10 .    the solution we search in the following form @xmath11 here @xmath12 are cylindrical coordinate system .",

    "the similar equations with the presence of @xmath21 and without masses @xmath22 was investigated in ref s",
    "@xcite @xcite where it was shown that the corresponding solutions becomes singular either on a finite distance from the axis @xmath23 or on the infinity .",
    "the solutions with the masses @xmath22 and a magnetic field @xmath24 were obtained in ref . @xcite and",
    "the result is that the following versions of the flux tube exist : ( 1 ) the flux tube filled with electric / magnetic fields on the background of an external constant magnetic / electric field ; ( 2 ) the nielsen - olesen flux tube dressed with transversal color electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we will solve the equations set - with an iterative procedure which is described in ref .",

    "it is the indication of the fact that the colored flux tube solution is not the consequence of any differential equations of the first order as it is for the topological solutions . in other words",
    "the colored flux tube is a dynamical object not topological one .",
    "in ref . @xcite was presented some arguments that the obtained there colored flux tube has a pure quantum origin .",
    "the arguments are that the su(3 ) quantum yang - mills theory in some approximation can be reduced to the classical su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs theory plus some extra term which is zero for the ansatz .",
    "we will describe this @xmath87 reduction following to ref .",
    "@xcite . at first",
    "the su(3 ) gauge potential on ordered and disordered phases should be decomposed :    1 .",
    "the gauge field components @xmath88 belonging to the small subgroup @xmath89 are in an ordered phase : @xmath90 the subscript @xmath91 means that the su(2 ) components of the su(3 ) gauge field can be considered as almost a classical field .",
    "@xmath92 is a quantum average .",
    "2 .   the gauge field components @xmath93 ( m=4,5 , ... , 8) and @xmath94 ) belonging to the coset su(3)/su(2 ) are in a disordered phase .",
    "i.e. they are a condensate of the coset components of the su(3 ) gauge field .",
    "it means that @xmath95 these degrees of freedom are pure quantum degrees and are involved in the equations for the ordered phase as an averaged field distribution of coset components .    in order to simplify the 2 and 4-points green s functions",
    "the following assumptions and simplifications was made :    1 .",
    "the correlation between coset components @xmath96 and @xmath97 in two points @xmath98 and @xmath99 is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the structural constants of the su(3 ) group .",
    "here we have to indicate that it is correct only for static fields , i.e. @xmath102 .",
    "2 .   there is not any correlation between ordered ( classical ) and disordered ( quantum ) phases @xmath103 where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are arbitrary functions .",
    "3 .   the 4-point green s function can be approximated as @xmath106 here @xmath107 are some constants and this approximation is also valid for the static fields .",
    "eq s and tell us that this approach can be called  one function approximation  .",
    "the final result of ref.@xcite is that the initial su(3 ) lagrangian @xmath108 with these assumptions and simplifications can be reduced to the su(2 ) yang - mills - higgs lagrangian @xmath109 it is necessary to note that the term @xmath110 here also presents the assumed gauge symmetry breakdown .",
    "we see that the first term @xmath111 is the su(2 ) lagrangian for the ordered phase @xmath3 and the higgs lagrangian is presented with the next three terms .",
    "let us note that there is an additional gauge noninvariant term @xmath112 but for the anstz the corresponding terms in field equations are zero .",
    "finally , in the context of offered here @xmath87 reduction the colored flux tube obtained above is _ a pure quantum object in the su(3 ) yang - mills theory_.",
    "the main result of this letter is that the confinement problem in qcd and the gauge symmetry breakdown can be closely connected . in our calculations",
    "the symmetry breaking term is presented by the mass term @xmath113 .",
    "of course this term is inserted by hand .",
    "the problem for the derivation of this term from the first principles is the absence of non - perturbative technique for the calculations in quantum field theories with strong interactions . although some calculations @xcite show us that such terms can be obtained in quantum gauge theories on the perturbative level .",
    "one can indicate the probable connection of our problem with a coleman - weinberg mechanism @xcite in @xmath114-theory .",
    "this mechanism gives us an additional term which changes an initial potential term and makes from its something like a higgs potential ( mexico hat ) .",
    "the origin of this phenomenon is the presence of the nonlinear potential @xmath115 in the theory .",
    "one can suppose that the similar mechanism will work in the quantum gauge theories where there is the potential term like to @xmath116 , but of course that here we have to use a non - perturbative technique which probably will be similar to the quantization method applied by heisenberg to a non - linear spinor field @xcite .",
    "another interesting property of the colored flux tube solution is the discreteness of masses @xmath117 and @xmath118 which gives the finitiness of the corresponding solution .",
    "we can make an assumption that it is connected with the fact that these parameters are quantum corrections and as it takes place in any quantum theory something should be quantized .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to note that the derived here the longitudinal electric filed is essentially nonlinear : it is not the gradient of some function but it appears from the nonlinear term @xmath119 of the non - abelian tensor @xmath120 , i.e. the maxwell eletrodynamics can not have such flux tube solutions even with broken gauge symmetry .",
    "one can say that the nonlinearity and symmetry breakdown of non - abelian gauge theories probably are the key ingredients of confinement problem in qcd .",
