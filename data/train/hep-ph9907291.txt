    "we present here the first investigation of the purely hadronic @xmath5 decay modes in our systematic investigation of @xmath19 ) @xmath1@xmath2 channels .",
    "the one lepton plus one charged hadron @xcite,@xcite and the one electron plus one muon @xcite final states have been shown to cover a significant region of the @xmath4 , @xmath7 parameter space at high @xmath7 values ( @xmath20 10 and @xmath21 150 gev ) .",
    "these channels have been studied in both the inclusive @xmath15 production mode , and in @xmath22 in association with b - jets . for higgs masses from 200 to 800 gev the fraction of events produced in association with b - jets varies from 75% to 80% for @xmath7 = 10 and from 75% to 96% for @xmath7 = 45 .",
    "the associated production channels provide much better signal to background ratios , but statistics is much reduced ( factor @xmath1420 ) and are very sensitive to the tracker performance through the b - tagging procedure , the associated b - jets tending to be rather soft and uniformly distributed between barrel and endcap pixels @xcite .",
    "studies of these channels are continuing , implementing detailed pattern recognition and track finding in the cms tracker @xcite .    for these @xmath23 @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath1@xmath24 + @xmath25 final states with two isolated hard hadrons ( plus @xmath26 s )",
    "we start with high masses @xmath27 300 gev , as for the low mass range ( @xmath14 150 gev ) these purely hadronic final states competing with qcd jets obviously run into difficulties firstly of triggering at an acceptable rate , and second , in the off - line analysis on problems of large background from qcd jets followed by hard fragmentation .",
    "these channels can however provide a spectacular signature for a sufficiently heavy higgs and should obviously extend significantly the upper @xmath15 mass reach due to favourable branching ratios .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath5 to single hadron plus any number of neutrals is about 50% .",
    "the combined branching ratio for @xmath23 @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath1@xmath28 is 2.8% compared to about 3.7% for @xmath23 @xmath1@xmath2 ra @xmath29 assuming br(@xmath23 @xmath1@xmath2 ) = 11% being roughly valid for the full @xmath4 and @xmath7 ( @xmath3010 ) range studied here .",
    "the fractional momentum taken away by the neutrinos is significantly smaller in the @xmath31 + @xmath25 final state compared to @xmath32 and especially @xmath33 final states , thus an improved @xmath15 @xmath1@xmath2 mass resolution can be expected , and improved signal / background if qcd background can be reduced below the irreducible @xmath10 background .",
    "the main reducible background sources are the qcd jets and @xmath34 events with @xmath35 @xmath1@xmath36 , and the irreducible ones are @xmath37 @xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath38 with @xmath35 @xmath1@xmath36 .",
    "the rate for qcd jets is very large ; about @xmath39 two - jet events with @xmath40 60 gev are expected for @xmath8",
    ". therefore a rejection factor of at least @xmath41 per jet is needed for a useful signal ( further rejection can be provided by @xmath6 cuts ) . in this",
    "study the @xmath5 identification is based solely on the presence of a single hard isolated charged hadron in the jet using tracker information .",
    "indeed a large rejection factor is obtained from the tracker alone , a result expected to be confirmed with the detailed simulation and track reconstruction currently under way .",
    "the use of calorimeter information exploiting the collimation of a @xmath5 jet to improve @xmath5 identification is also presently in progress , with geant calorimeter simulation @xcite@xcite .",
    "we are also investigating the possibility to use the impact parameter measurement of the hard hadron from @xmath5 to further reduce the qcd background .",
    "all these improvements will thus further reinforce and extend the reach of the @xmath15 @xmath1@xmath2 channel , the only channel which until now gives us access to the theoretically favoured @xmath42 500 gev mass range . however , this channel should also play an important ( decisive ? ) role in the intermediate mass range 150 gev @xmath43 300 gev , which is the most critical one from the point of view of the mssm @xmath7 , @xmath4 parameter space coverage , provided we can trigger on it efficiently , which requires a dedicated study and is not discussed here .",
    "events are generated with pythia @xcite .",
    "masses and couplings of susy higgses are calculated using two - loop / rge - improved radiative corrections @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios and cross sections are normalized using the hdecay program @xcite .",
    "no stop mixing is included and the susy particles are first assumed to be heavy enough not to contribute to the susy higgs decays . the decays to neutralinos and charginos can however reduce strongly the @xmath23 @xmath1@xmath2 branching ratio at low @xmath7 , and by a factor of two even at @xmath7 = 30 @xcite . for the high @xmath4 and @xmath7 region investigated here",
    "the effects of sparticle decay modes are nevertheless relatively modest , as mentioned later on . in the case of stop mixing ,",
    "if the light stop @xmath44 is lighter than or comparable in mass to the top quark , the squark loop effects are expected to suppress significantly the @xmath45 @xmath1@xmath46 production processes @xcite . for the large @xmath4 and @xmath7 values discussed here",
    "this would mean at most a 20% reduction in the production rate as we are dominated by @xmath45 @xmath1@xmath47 tree - diagram production which is not affected by @xmath48 - @xmath49 interference effects .",
    "for the qcd background , pythia two - jet events with initial and final state qcd radiation are generated .",
    "a cut @xmath50 50 gev is applied for the hard process at the generation level .",
    "the default lund fragmentation is used .",
    "the cms detector response is simulated and the jets and the missing transverse energy are reconstructed with the fast simulation package cmsjet @xcite .",
    "the loss of reconstruction efficiency for the hard track due to secondary interactions in the tracker material ( @xmath14 20% of @xmath51 ) , as well as the degradation of the track isolation due to conversions of accompanying @xmath26 @xmath1@xmath52 in tracker , is taken into account only is average , which is sufficient at this stage .",
    "hard @xmath5 jets are expected in the @xmath23 @xmath1@xmath2 @xmath1@xmath28 events at large @xmath4 as can be seen from fig . 1 which shows the @xmath54 distribution of hadronic @xmath5 jets for @xmath4 = 300 , 500 and 800 gev and the @xmath54 distribution of the two hardest jets in qcd jet events ( fig.1c ) .",
    "events are required to have at least two calorimetric jets with @xmath55 60 gev within @xmath56 2.5 .",
    "the @xmath5 jet canditates are chosen to be the @xmath5 jets for the signal and for the backgrounds with real @xmath5 s , i.e. from @xmath57 @xmath1@xmath2 and @xmath38 events .",
    "for the qcd background the @xmath5 jet canditates are taken to be the jets with highest @xmath54 .",
    "events are assumed to be triggered with a two - jet trigger with full trigger efficiency for @xmath40 60 gev at this stage . for @xmath27 300",
    "gev and a threshold @xmath40 60 gev the trigger efficiency is high and the trigger rate acceptable at @xmath58 @xcite . for high luminosity running , and",
    "in particular for the lower mass range 150 gev @xmath59 300 gev , a better understunding of possible @xmath60 level triggers and of trigger efficiency versus @xmath54 is needed and then implemented in this type of study .",
    "a jet is defined to be a `` @xmath5 '' jet if it contains one isolated hard hadron within @xmath61 0.1 from the calorimeter jet axis .",
    "a powerfull tracker isolation can be implemented in cms thanks to efficient track finding down to low @xmath62 values ( 0.9 gev ) @xcite . here",
    "we require that there in no other track with @xmath63 1 gev than the hard track in a larger cone of @xmath61 0.4 around the calorimeter jet axis .",
    "this isolation criterion is adequate for running at the luminosity of about @xmath64 , i.e. without significant event pile - up .",
    "figure 2 shows the transverse momentum for the isolated single track in a jet with @xmath55 60 gev and @xmath65 2.5 for signal events at @xmath4 = 300 , 500 and 800 gev , for the @xmath57 @xmath1@xmath2 , @xmath38 events with @xmath35 @xmath1@xmath66 and for qcd jet events .",
    "the @xmath5 selection efficiencies per jet , due to both track isolation and the hard track @xmath62 threshold cut are shown in table 1 as a function of the @xmath62 for the signal and backgrounds . as can be seen from the table , a rejection factor against the qcd jets varying from 700 to about 1500 is obtained from tracker momenta alone . in the following ,",
    "@xmath67 40 gev is chosen , with an efficiency of 50% for the signal at @xmath4 = 500 gev and 22% and 32% for the @xmath37 @xmath1@xmath2 background in the low and high mass range , respectively .",
    "the rejection factor against qcd jets is then about 1500 .",
    "the rejection factor against the qcd jets is obviously sensitive to the fragmentation function used to simulate the jets . on this point",
    "a more detailed study is needed to understand the hard fragmentation effects in jets .",
    "the rejection factor shown in table 1 is an average factor for @xmath40 60 gev .",
    "as the simulation of even one qcd jet event with two jets with @xmath55 60 gev both containing one isolated hard hadron with @xmath63 40 gev is not possible , we have evaluated the rejection factor as a function of @xmath68 generating large numbers of qcd jets in several @xmath54 bins .",
    "this is shown in fig . 3 and is used in the simulation and evaluation of the qcd background assuming also factorisation of the two jet fragmentations . for a qcd jet with @xmath54 values between 300 and 350 gev , for instance",
    ", the probability to fluctuate into a `` @xmath5 '' jet with one isolated charged hadron with @xmath63 40 gev is about @xmath69 .",
    "the two hard tracks from @xmath70 and @xmath71 in the signal events have an opposite sign while no such strong charge correlation is expected for the qcd jet events . as the charge assignement in cms",
    "is almost 100% for tracks with @xmath72 1 tev @xcite , about half of the qcd background can be removed by requiring an opposite charge for the two isolated hadrons .    0.1 in    .@xmath5 selection efficiency per jet using just tracker momentum measurement for @xmath73 @xmath1  @xmath74 with @xmath5 @xmath1@xmath75 at @xmath4 = 300 , 500 and 800 gev , for @xmath37 @xmath1  @xmath74 in the low and high mass range and for qcd jet background , with @xmath40 60 gev and @xmath76 2.4 .",
    "the hard track is required to be within @xmath77 = 0.1 from the calorimeter jet axis and isolated in the tracker with respect to tracks with a @xmath62 threshold of 1 gev in a cone of @xmath77 = 0.4 around the calorimeter jet axis . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table4 ]      as well known , despite at least two escaping neutrinos , the higgs mass can be approximately reconstructed from the two @xmath5 jets measured in calorimetry and from the @xmath6 , when the two @xmath5 s are not exactly back - to - back , by projecting the @xmath6 vector on the directions of the reconstructed @xmath5 jets .",
    "this has been shown in connection with the @xmath73 @xmath1  @xmath74 @xmath1@xmath78 @xcite @xcite and @xmath73 @xmath1  @xmath74 @xmath1@xmath79 @xcite channels .",
    "figure 6a shows for example the reconstructed higgs mass for @xmath4 = 500 gev ( @xmath7 = 20 ) with the cuts discussed above and without pile - up .",
    "an upper limit of @xmath80 175@xmath81 is applied .",
    "a gaussian fit to the mass distribution for a and h ( which are almost mass degenarate ) yields 58 gev for the resolution ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the mass resolution can be significantly improved by reducing the upper limit in @xmath83 between the two @xmath5 jets i.e. making them less back - to - back as is shown in fig . 6b for the same mass . for @xmath84 160@xmath81 compared to @xmath84 175@xmath81 the resolution improves from 58 to 42 gev and the tail is reduced . this would however lead to a 55% loss of signal statistics and is not used here but shows the potential gain in resolution in conditions where statistics would not be the limiting factor .",
    "figures 6c and 6d show the reconstructed higgs masses for @xmath4 = 300 gev ( @xmath7 = 15 ) and for @xmath4 = 800 gev ( @xmath7 = 45 ) , all for @xmath84 175@xmath81 .",
    "the fitted mass resolutions are 33 gev and 92 gev , respectively . for @xmath4 = 800 gev and @xmath7 = 45",
    "the natural higgs width is 43 gev thus instrumental effects still dominate observed signal width .",

    "this is due to the fact that the mass resolution is dominated by the precision of the @xmath6 measurement , and the resolution is better in the channels with a smaller fraction of energy carried away by neutrinos , i.e. in the case of two hadronic @xmath5 decays .",
    "this significantly better mass resolution and thus possibly best signal / background ratio ( provided the qcd background is reducible below irreducible @xmath10 background ) - not fully appreciated before - also speaks in favour of these double hadronic final states .",

    "no possible @xmath60 level trigger losses have been included , and they may be not negligible in the @xmath4 = 300 gev case . for the high mass range investigated here and after @xmath6 cuts , the qcd jet background is well below the irreducible @xmath10 background .",

    "concerning both production dynamics ( in particular for qcd background ) and approximations made in the fast simulation of detector response , the discovery potential for large @xmath73 masses in this channel is clear .",
    "of course , more detailed studies are needed to confirm and consolidate these preliminary results .",

    "the @xmath5 selection is based here largely on the tracker , requiring a hard isolated single track with @xmath63 40 gev in the jet .",
    "this already provides a large rejection factor against qcd jets , allowing a major suppression of this background .",
    "the qcd background can be further reduced by a cut on the missing transverse energy .",
    "a rejection factor of about 100 is obtained with a cut @xmath89 40 - 60 gev thus suppressing the qcd background much below the irreducible @xmath37 @xmath1@xmath2 background .",
    "the effectiveness of these @xmath6 cuts at rather modest @xmath6 values has however still to be checked with full cmsim simulations for full reliability .",

    "even for these boundary @xmath7 values the mass peak may be recognized above the background distribution ( figs . 8 and 9 ) ; away from the boundary the mass peak can be rather spectacular .",
    "these @xmath10 @xmath1@xmath99 + @xmath100 modes provide the best mass resolution at same @xmath86 and @xmath7 when compared to other @xmath10 final states ( figs . 8c and 8d ) .    the 5@xmath82 discovery limit of fig .",
    "10 is a preliminary result , optimized for high masses , and based on a fast simulation of the cms tracker and calorimeter and on a @xmath5 selection , exploiting only momentum measurements in the tracker .",
    "an improvement in the qcd background rejection in the low mass range ( @xmath108 300 gev ) can be expected by including the calorimeter @xmath5 selection developed in @xcite exploiting the collimation of the hadronic @xmath5 signal in the ecal and the @xmath5 isolation in the ecal+hcal .",
