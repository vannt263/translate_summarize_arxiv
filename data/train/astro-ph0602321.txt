    "we constrain dark energy models by doing a joint analysis of the snia apparent magnitude versus redshift data of r04 and the galaxy cluster gas mass fraction versus redshift data of a04 .",
    "there are a number of different dark energy models under current discussion .",
    "the current  standard \" cosmological model is @xmath1cdm ( peebles 1984 ) , where the energy density of the low - redshift universe is dominated by a cosmological constant @xmath1 ( with a constant energy density @xmath2 ) , with nonrelativistic matter  mostly cold dark matter ( cdm )  playing a subdominant role .",
    "models in which the dark energy is due to a slowly varying , in time and space , scalar field ( @xmath3 ) , have also attracted recent attention .",
    "a prototypical @xmath3cdm example has scalar field potential energy density @xmath4 , at low redshift ( peebles & ratra 1988 ; ratra & peebles 1988 ) ; again cdm plays a subdominant role . also discussed is the xcdm parametrization for time - varying dark energy .",
    "this parametrization approximates dark energy by a fluid with a negative time - independent equation of state parameter @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the fluid pressure and @xmath7 the energy density .",
    "this is an inaccurate approximation during the scalar field dominated epoch when @xmath8 is time dependent ( see , e.g. , ratra 1991 ) .",
    "we consider spatially flat spacetimes for the @xmath3cdm model and the xcdm parametrization , but allow spatial curvature to be a free parameter in the @xmath1cdm case . in this paper",
    "we constrain parameters of these three models by using snia and galaxy cluster data .    in @xmath9",
    "we show how we use the supernova and galaxy cluster data to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "results are presented and discussed in @xmath10 .",
    "we conclude in @xmath11 .",
    "a04 list x - ray gas mass fractions for 26 rich clusters , determined from @xmath12 observations .",
    "these clusters lie at redshifts between 0.08 and 0.89 . following a04 and cr",
    ", we use this data to determine the probability distribution function ( likelihood ) @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the hubble constant in units of 100 @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the cosmological constant density parameter @xmath17 for the @xmath1cdm model , @xmath8 for the xcdm parametrization , and @xmath18 for the @xmath3cdm model . to derive @xmath19",
    "we marginalize over the bias factor @xmath20 , as well as over @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the baryonic mass density parameter",
    ". later we will need to marginalize over @xmath14 .",
    "we account for uncertainties in @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath14 by using gaussian priors with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , all one standard deviation errors . than the value quoted above , @xmath26 ( gott et al .",
    "2001 ; chen et al .",
    "2003 , and we have halved the quoted two standard deviation errors ) .",
    "also , the @xmath21 value used above is consistent with the estimate from the wmap cmb anisotropy measurement and the primordial deuterium abundance measurement , but significantly higher than an estimate based on the primordial helium and lithium abundance measurements ( see , e.g. , peebles & ratra 2003 ; steigman 2005 ; fields & sarkar 2006 ) , so we also consider the peebles & ratra ( 2003 ) summary estimate @xmath27 .",
    "constraints derived using the values of @xmath14 and @xmath21 quoted in this footnote are shown as darker dashed lines in figs .  24 , while constraints from the priors quoted in the main text are shown using lighter continuous lines . ]",
    "see a04 and cr for more detailed discussions of the procedure we use .",
    "we also use the snia apparent magnitude versus redshift data from r04 , in particular , the gold data set of 156 snia with redshifts up to almost 1.8 . from this data",
    "we determine the probability distribution function @xmath28 , following , e.g. , r04 or podariu & ratra ( 2000 ) .",
    "the joint likelihood for the snia and galaxy cluster data is the product of the two individual likelihoods .",
    "the two - dimensional probability distribution function for @xmath0 and @xmath16 , @xmath29 , is determined by marginalizing this product over @xmath14 . for each of the three models mentioned above",
    ", we compute @xmath29 on the two - dimensional @xmath30 grid .",
    "the 1 , 2 , and 3 @xmath31 confidence contours are the set of points where the likelihood is @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 of the maximum likelihood value .",
    "figure 1 shows the r04 gold snia constraints on the @xmath3cdm model with @xmath35 , determined by marginalizing @xmath36 over @xmath14 .",
    "these contours are significantly more constraining than those derived by podariu & ratra ( 2000 , fig .",
    "1 ) from earlier snia data .    figure 2 shows the combined snia and galaxy cluster constraints on the @xmath1cdm model .",
    "these joint constraints are significantly tighter than those derived using either the snia data ( r04 , fig .",
    "8) or the galaxy cluster data ( a04 , figs .  4 and 8 ; cr , fig .",
    "1 ) alone .",
    "this is because the galaxy cluster data tend to tightly constrain @xmath0 ( a04 , cr ) , while the snia data tend to tightly constrain a linear combination of @xmath37 and @xmath0 ( r04 ) .",
    "together , the data focus attention on a small part of parameter space near @xmath38 and @xmath39 where the universe is spatially flat .",
    "figure 3 shows the joint data constraints on the xcdm parametrization .",
    "models close to @xmath40 and @xmath41 are favored .",
    "we emphasize that @xmath42 corresponds to the spatially - flat @xmath1cdm model .",
    "figure 4 shows the joint data constraints on the @xmath3cdm model with @xmath35 .",
    "models close to @xmath43 and @xmath44 are favored .",
    "we note that @xmath45 corresponds to the spatially - flat @xmath1cdm model .",
    "the snia and galaxy cluster data together favor a spatially - flat @xmath1cdm model with @xmath46",
    ". it might be significant that other data also favor this value of @xmath0 ( see , e.g. , chen & ratra 2003b ; spergel et al .",
    "we emphasize , however , that slowly - evolving dark energy models are also consistent with this data .",
    "we use supernova ia apparent magnitude and x - ray cluster gas mass fraction data to jointly constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "these data sets provide complementary constraints and together they tightly constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "the spatially - flat @xmath1cdm model is favored , although a @xmath3cdm model with slowly - decreasing dark energy can not yet be ruled out .",
    "more and better snia and galaxy cluster data will allow for tighter constraints on model parameters .",
    "equally important would be a resolution of the conflict between the two different sets of estimates of @xmath22 , as well as tighter limits on @xmath14 .",
    "all these are likely to happen in the next few years .",
