    "in the ponzano  regge model of 3-dimensional riemannian quantum gravity  @xcite , an amplitude is associated with each tetrahedron in a triangulation of spacetime .",
    "the amplitude depends on the tetrahedron s six edge lengths , which are assumed to be quantized , taking values proportional to @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a half - integer spin .",
    "one can compute this amplitude either by evaluating an @xmath6 spin network shaped like a tetrahedron , or by doing an integral . approximating this integral by the stationary phase method , ponzano and",
    "regge argued that when all six spins are rescaled by the same factor @xmath7 , the @xmath8 asymptotics of the amplitude are given by a simple function of the volume of the tetrahedron and the regge calculus version of its einstein action .",
    "nobody has yet succeeded in making their argument rigorous , but roberts @xcite recently proved their asymptotic formula by a different method . this result lays the foundation for a careful study of the relation between the ponzano  regge model and classical general relativity in 3 dimensions .",
    "our concern here is whether a similar result holds for the barrett",

    "4-dimensional _ riemannian quantum gravity  @xcite . in this model",
    "an amplitude is associated with each 4-simplex in a triangulation of spacetime .",
    "this amplitude , known as a @xmath0 symbol , is a function of the areas of the 10 triangular faces of the 4-simplex .",
    "each triangle area is proportional to @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a spin labelling the triangle .",
    "the amplitude can be computed by evaluating an @xmath9 spin network whose edges correspond to the triangles of the 4-simplex : @xmath10 there is also an integral formula for the @xmath0 symbol  @xcite .",
    "the problem is to understand the asymptotics of the @xmath0 symbol as all 10 spins are rescaled by a factor @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "barrett and williams  @xcite applied a stationary phase approximation to the integral for the @xmath0 symbol , focusing attention on stationary phase points corresponding to nondegenerate 4-simplices with the specified face areas .",
    "they showed that each such 4-simplex contributes to the @xmath0 symbol in a manner that depends on its regge action .",
    "they pointed out the existence of contributions from degenerate 4-simplices , but did not analyse them .    in section 2 of this paper",
    "we begin by applying barrett and williams estimate of the @xmath0 symbols to the case where all 10 spins are equal .",
    "we find that the contribution of their stationary phase points to the @xmath0 symbols is of order @xmath11 .",
    "however , our numerical calculations show that the @xmath0 symbols are much larger , of order @xmath12 .",
    "this means we must look elsewhere to explain the asymptotics of the @xmath0 symbol .    in section 3",
    "we analyse the contribution of ` degenerate 4-simplices ' to the integral for the @xmath0 symbols .",
    "they do not correspond to stationary phase points in the integral for the @xmath0 symbols ; instead , the integrand has a strong _ maximum _ at these points .",
    "we argue that the contribution of a small neighborhood of these points is asymptotically proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "we give a formula expressing the constant of proportionality as an integral over the space of degenerate 4-simplices .",
    "we also reduce this to an explicit integral in 5 variables .    in section 4 , we numerically compare these results to the @xmath0 symbols as calculated using the algorithm developed by christensen and egan @xcite .",
    "our formula for the contribution of degenerate 4-simplices closely matches the actual asymptotics of the @xmath0 symbols .",
    "thus , even though our argument that these asymptotics are dominated by degenerate 4-simplices is not rigorous , we feel confident that the resulting formula is correct .    in section 5 we discuss a new sort of spin network , associated to the representation theory of the euclidean group , which arises naturally in our analysis of the contribution of degenerate 4-simplices . generalizing our results on the riemannian @xmath0 symbols , we conjecture formulas for the asymptotics of a large class of riemannian spin networks in terms of these new ` degenerate spin networks ' .",
    "we verify this conjecture in a number of simple cases .    in section 6",
    "we formulate a similar conjecture for lorentzian spin networks . taken with the previous one this conjecture implies that the @xmath8 asymptotics of a lorentzian spin network in this class are the same , up to a constant , as those of the corresponding riemannian spin network .",
    "for example , as @xmath13 , the lorentzian @xmath0 symbol should be asymptotic to @xmath3 times the corresponding riemannian @xmath0 symbol !",
    "we conclude by presenting some numerical evidence that this is the case .",
    "the @xmath0 symbols can be defined using a riemannian spin network  also known as a ` balanced ' spin network  @xcite  whose underlying graph is the complete graph on five vertices .",
    "the ten edges of the graph are labelled with half - integer spins @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 refer to the vertices connected by each edge . in this approach , an edge labelled by",
    "the spin @xmath5 corresponds to the representation @xmath17 of @xmath18 , and the @xmath0 symbols are computed using the representation theory of this group .",
    "however , to analyse the asymptotics of the @xmath0 symbol , it is easier to use the integral formula due to barrett  @xcite .",
    "this is : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the unit 3-sphere in @xmath21 equipped with its usual lebesgue measure , @xmath22 is the angle between the unit vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the kernel @xmath25 is given by : @xmath26 the normalizing factors in the integral come from the fact that the volume of the unit 3-sphere is @xmath27 .",
    "the @xmath0 symbol gives the amplitude for a 4-simplex with specified triangle areas .",
    "each vertex of the above graph corresponds to a tetrahedron in this 4-simplex , and each edge of the graph corresponds to the unique triangle shared by two of these tetrahedra . in this picture , the spin @xmath28 determines the area of the triangle shared by the @xmath15th and @xmath16th tetrahedra .",
    "the precise formula for this area is somewhat controversial @xcite , but given the integral formula for the @xmath0 symbols , we find it convenient to assume the area is proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "ignoring the constant factor , we thus define triangle areas by : @xmath30    in what follows , we study the behaviour of the @xmath0 symbol as all these triangle areas @xmath31 are multiplied by a large integer @xmath7 .",
    "this is not the same as multiplying the spins @xmath28 by @xmath7 .",
    "however , note that as @xmath28 ranges over all spins , @xmath31 ranges over all positive integers .",
    "this means that if we multiply the areas @xmath31 by any positive integer @xmath7 , we can find new spins @xmath32 corresponding to the new areas by solving @xmath33 .",
    "it is shown in  @xcite that the integral in   is nonnegative .",
    "accordingly , we will concentrate on analysing the asymptotics of the absolute value of the @xmath0 symbol , given by the integral alone : @xmath34 where for simplicity we have left out the spins labelling the spin network edges , which are now @xmath32 .",
    "barrett and williams  @xcite express the numerator in the kernel @xmath25 as a difference of exponentials , which allows them to rewrite the integrand in equation   as a sum of @xmath35 terms , each consisting of an exponential times the function : @xmath36 this function is unbounded as any of the @xmath22 tend to zero or @xmath37 , but if the regions of the domain where that occurs are set aside for a separate analysis , the integral over the remaining region becomes amenable to a stationary phase approximation  @xcite .",
    "the relevant phase is simply : @xmath38 the phases of the @xmath35 exponentials arising from the product of the kernels include variants of @xmath39 with all possible signs for the ten terms .",
    "however , barrett and williams use the invariance of the integrand under the transformations @xmath40 to break the integral into @xmath41 identical parts , according to whether @xmath42 , where @xmath43 are the outward normals of a 4-simplex whose five tetrahedra lie in the hyperplanes normal to the @xmath23 .",
    "they then focus on the region where all the @xmath44 , and show that of the @xmath35 phases , only @xmath39 and its opposite have stationary points in this region , and they occur when the @xmath22 are the angles between the outward normals to the tetrahedra of a 4-simplex whose ten faces have areas given by @xmath45 . in this case",
    "the @xmath23 can be interpreted as the outward normals to the five tetrahedra , the @xmath22 are the angles between these normals , and @xmath45 is the area of the face shared by the tetrahedra numbered @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "interpreted this way , @xmath39 is precisely the regge action for the 4-simplex .",
    "this means that the relevant stationary phase points are those of a much simpler integral : @xmath46 to carry out a stationary phase approximation of this integral we must note that the stationary phase ` point ' determined by the geometry of a 4-simplex is not actually a single point in the 15-dimensional manifold @xmath47 , but rather a whole 6-dimensional submanifold , since the geometry of the 4-simplex is invariant under the 6-parameter rotation group @xmath1 .",
    "however , the same invariance can be used to remove this complication .",
    "since the functions @xmath48 and @xmath39 are invariant under the action of @xmath1 , they pass to the quotient space @xmath49 , and we obtain : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the result of pushing forward lebesgue measure on @xmath47 to this quotient space .",
    "a factor of @xmath52 here accounts for the complication that simultaneously negating all the @xmath23 has the same action as @xmath53 , an element of @xmath1 , and so the discrete symmetries used to obtain   already entailed taking the quotient by a 2-element subgroup of @xmath1 .",
    "now , the stationary phase approximation  @xcite of an @xmath54-dimensional integral @xmath55 is a sum over stationary points @xmath56 of the function @xmath39 : @xmath57 , \\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the matrix of second partial derivatives of @xmath39 at the point @xmath56 , and @xmath59 is the signature of this matrix , i.e. , the number of positive eigenvalues minus the number of negative eigenvalues .",
    "this approximation assumes there are finitely many stationary points , all with @xmath60 . applying this to the case at hand , and neglecting points where some of the angles @xmath22 are @xmath61 or @xmath37 , we obtain barrett and williams stationary phase approximation of the @xmath0 symbols : @xmath62,\\ ] ] where the sum is over the 4-simplices @xmath63 with the specified face areas .",
    "we can easily say something about the @xmath8 behavior of this quantity without actually evaluating it .",
    "each stationary point @xmath56 is independent of @xmath7 , so @xmath64 will be constant as @xmath8 , while @xmath65 will grow linearly , as will its matrix of second derivatives , @xmath58 .",
    "this is a @xmath66 matrix , since @xmath49 is 9-dimensional , so its determinant will grow as @xmath67 .",
    "it follows that : @xmath68 however , cancellation between different stationary points could in principle make this a misleading overestimate .",
    "thus it seems worthwhile to explicitly evaluate the sum in equation  , at least in a simple special case .    in",
    "what follows we evaluate this sum for the case of a @xmath0 symbol with all edges labelled by the same spins .",
    "in other words , we calculate the stationary phase approximation of the amplitude for a regular 4-simplex .",
    "the first step , which would be useful more generally , is to find explicit coordinates on the quotient space @xmath49 and describe the measure @xmath51 in these terms .",
    "to do this , we exploit the fact that any configuration of the five unit vectors @xmath23 can be rotated into one that belongs to a 9-dimensional subspace of the original domain .",
    "specifically , if we express the vectors @xmath23 in polar coordinates @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 , any set of @xmath23 can be rotated in such a way that the following restrictions are met :    [ e : gaugefix ] @xmath72    by means of this ` gauge - fixing ' we can use the remaining 9 variables @xmath73 @xmath74 @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 @xmath81 as coordinates on the quotient space . to describe the measure",
    "@xmath51 in these coordinates recall that in polar coordinates , lebesgue measure on the unit 3-sphere is given by    [ e : measures ] @xmath82 since @xmath83 is completely fixed we omit @xmath84 from the formula for @xmath51 , only inserting a factor @xmath27 due to the volume of the 3-sphere .",
    "since @xmath85 and @xmath86 are partially fixed we replace @xmath87 and @xmath88 by @xmath89    we thus obtain @xmath90    next , we determine the stationary points of the function @xmath39 in the case where all ten spins are equal , neglecting points where some of the angles @xmath22 are @xmath61 or @xmath37  that is , where some of the vectors @xmath23 are parallel or anti - parallel .",
    "recall that these stationary points correspond to nondegenerate 4-simplices having all 10 face areas equal .",
    "one obvious candidate is the regular 4-simplex .",
    "however , we must rule out the possibility that there are other , _ non - regular _ 4-simplices for which all the faces have identical areas .",
    "since we are excluding degenerate 4-simplices from the current analysis , we can appeal to a theorem of bang  @xcite which states that if all the faces of a non - degenerate tetrahedron have the same area , they are all congruent .",
    "it follows that if all ten triangles in a non - degenerate 4-simplex have the same area , they too are all congruent .",
    "now , each of the ten edges of a 4-simplex is shared by three triangles , so we can treat each edge as a triple of congruent line segments that happen to be superimposed , giving a total of 30 in all . if all the triangles were congruent isoceles triangles , each with one side of length @xmath91 , then ten of these 30 line segments would be of length @xmath91 .",
    "however , there is no way to partition ten line segments into congruent triples .",
    "the same argument rules out scalene triangles .",
    "so the faces must be equilateral , and the 4-simplex must be regular .",
    "we must therefore find all sets of unit vectors @xmath23 which satisfy the gauge - fixing conditions in equation   and form the outward normals of a regular 4-simplex .",
    "one choice is : @xmath92 these vectors have mutual dot products of @xmath93 .",
    "they represent a single point in our 9-dimensional domain :    [ e : statphasepoint ] @xmath94    the only other choice comes from interchanging @xmath95 and @xmath81 .",
    "this yields another regular 4-simplex .",
    "now we take the phase   and specialise to the case where all the spins @xmath28 are equal , say to @xmath5 . setting @xmath96 , and working in our chosen coordinates ,",
    "we obtain @xmath97 the partial derivatives of @xmath39 are all zero at the point described by  .",
    "symbolic computer calculations show that at this point the matrix of second derivatives of @xmath39 has 5 positive eigenvalues and 4 negative ones , and a determinant of : @xmath98 applying this result to   at the point described by  , working in our chosen coordinates , redefining the function @xmath99 to include the measure   as well as the kernel denominators  , and multiplying by a factor of two to account for the second point where @xmath95 and @xmath81 are interchanged , we obtain : @xmath100\\ ] ] the above expression consists of an oscillating term times a function proportional to @xmath11 . in short ,",
    "the estimate @xmath101 is sharp , at least for the case of 10 equal spins .",
    "however , our numerical calculations of the @xmath0 symbols exhibit very different behaviour . rather than being of order @xmath11",
    ", they appear to be much larger , of order @xmath12 . also , they exhibit no discernable oscillations . in the next section",
    "we argue that these results are explained by the contribution of ` degenerate 4-simplices ' .",
    "the absolute value of the kernel @xmath102 has maxima when the angle @xmath103 equals @xmath61 or @xmath37 , and these maxima become ever more sharply peaked as @xmath104 .",
    "this means that as @xmath8 , the integrand in equation   becomes very large at ` degenerate points ' , where some of the vectors @xmath23 are either parallel or anti - parallel .",
    "we have made a detailed study of the ` fully degenerate ' points , where _ all _ the vectors @xmath23 are either parallel or anti - parallel .",
    "it is plausible to expect the contribution from a neighborhood of these points to dominate the integral for the @xmath0 symbol , at least asymptotically as @xmath13 , since in this region we are integrating a product of kernels , all of which are near their greatest possible absolute value . in the next section we shall present numerical evidence that this is in fact the case .",
    "the value of the kernel is positive at @xmath105 , but at @xmath106 its sign is positive when @xmath107 is even and negative otherwise , where @xmath108 . at first glance , this appears to allow the possibility that parallel and anti - parallel degenerate points might cancel each other for certain values of the spins .",
    "in fact , cancellation can occur only when the @xmath0 symbol vanishes .",
    "the integrand in   is the product of ten kernels , so it will be positive when all the @xmath23 are parallel .",
    "if @xmath83 is replaced by its opposite , the four @xmath109 will change from zero to @xmath37 , leading to an overall sign change of @xmath110 .",
    "however , for the @xmath0 symbol to be non - zero , the spins at each vertex must sum to an integer  @xcite .",
    "therefore , if the @xmath0 symbol is non - zero , the sign of the integrand will remain positive . the same argument applies if any subset of the @xmath23 are reversed .    in the integral in equation  ,",
    "fully degenerate points occur in 3-dimensional submanifolds of the domain , but we can apply the same gauge - fixing principles as we used to analyse the stationary points , in this case simply fixing @xmath111 .",
    "there are then 16 discrete fully degenerate points in the restricted domain : those where @xmath112 for @xmath113 . restricting the integral to the vicinity of these points we obtain @xmath114 where @xmath115 is a small open ball around the point @xmath116 .",
    "we approximate this quantity by noting that when @xmath103 is small , the kernel in   is close to : @xmath117 we call this quantity the ` degenerate kernel ' . as we shall see in section  [ s : euclidean ] , this is the analog of the original kernel in a spin - network formalism where the space of constant curvature , @xmath20 , is replaced by three - dimensional euclidean space , and the group @xmath1 , the isometry group of @xmath20 , is replaced by the euclidean group of isometries of @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , the integral over a small subset of @xmath118 can be approximated by an integral over a subset of @xmath119 , and the angle @xmath22 between unit vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 in @xmath20 replaced by the euclidean distance @xmath120 between vectors @xmath121 and @xmath122 in @xmath2 . in terms of these new euclidean variables , the restriction @xmath111 is replaced by @xmath123 .",
    "thus , when @xmath7 is large , we have : @xmath124 where now @xmath115 is a small open ball around the origin of @xmath119 .",
    "the approximation   exhibits very simple scaling behaviour .",
    "first , note that the degenerate kernel   obeys the identity : @xmath125 this allows the scaling of   to be deduced from a linear change of variables , @xmath126 : @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the result of rescaling the neighborhood @xmath115 by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "if the integral on the right hand side of this equation converges in the limit @xmath129 , we obtain the asymptotic formula : @xmath130 we call this integral the ` degenerate @xmath0 symbol ' .",
    "apart from the factor of @xmath131 , the integral here can be interpreted as the evaluation of a spin network with edges labelled by unitary irreducible representations of the euclidean group : the group of isometries of euclidean 3-space .",
    "we discuss this interpretation in more detail in section  [ s : euclidean ] .    while elegant , the integral in is difficult to compute numerically , very much like the integral for the lorentzian @xmath0 symbol . to obtain a more convenient form for evaluation ,",
    "we make use of the kirillov trace formula : @xmath132 where @xmath133 is a vector in @xmath2 , and the integral is over the unit 2-sphere with its standard measure .",
    "this formula is easily confirmed by choosing spherical coordinates such that the @xmath134-axis is parallel to the vector @xmath133 . for our purposes",
    "we shall rewrite it as follows : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the 2-sphere of radius @xmath137 embedded in @xmath2 , but where @xmath138 is the induced lebesgue measure divided by @xmath139 , to hide some annoying constants that would otherwise appear in this formula . using this",
    "we can rewrite   as : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is a cartesian product of 2-spheres with the measures described above , and @xmath142 is defined by : @xmath143 if @xmath144 then the final integral in   will be well - behaved so long as at each point @xmath145 the differential of @xmath146 has maximal rank , namely 12 .",
    "when this is the case @xmath147 is an 8-dimensional submanifold of @xmath148 , and the integral reduces to : @xmath149 here @xmath138 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath147 induced by the riemannian metric on @xmath148 , but divided by a factor of @xmath150 , since we have divided the lebesgue measure on each sphere by a factor of @xmath151 .",
    "if we choose local coordinates @xmath152 on @xmath148 near @xmath145 such that @xmath153 are zero on @xmath147 , then @xmath154 is the jacobian determinant of @xmath146 as a function of the remaining 12 variables @xmath155 .",
    "one way to get solutions of @xmath156 is to start with 4-simplices in @xmath2 : that is , 5-tuples of points in @xmath2 , together with the ten triangles and five tetrahedra determined by these points .",
    "given such a 4-simplex , let @xmath157 be the vector that is normal to the triangle shared by the @xmath15th and @xmath16th tetrahedra , and has length equal to the area of this triangle . as shown in  @xcite , the four vectors @xmath157 normal to the triangles in any one tetrahedron must sum to zero , with appropriate signs : @xmath158 each vector appears twice in these formulas , with opposite signs , since the outwards - pointing normal to one tetrahedron is the inwards - pointing normal to another .",
    "the first four equations say that @xmath156 ; the last is an algebraic consequence of the rest . if @xmath159 , the vectors @xmath157 thus determine a point in @xmath147 .",
    "this suggests that we think of points of @xmath147 as ` degenerate 4-simplices ' .",
    "however , not every point of @xmath147 comes from a 5-tuple of points in @xmath2 this way . to see this , note that two 5-tuples in @xmath2 determine the same point in @xmath147 if they are translates of each other .",
    "the space of 5-tuples modulo translation has dimension @xmath160 , but the space of solutions of equation   has dimension @xmath161 .",
    "thus there are simply not enough 5-tuples of points in @xmath2 to account for all solutions of equation  .",
    "we shall still call points of @xmath147 ` degenerate 4-simplices ' , because it is a useful heuristic .",
    "however , it is important to take this phrase with a grain of salt .    of course",
    ", for the space @xmath147 to be nonempty , there must _ exist _ a solution of @xmath156 .",
    "this imposes certain restrictions on the numbers @xmath31 .",
    "for example , there will be a solution of @xmath162 if and only if these ` tetrahedron inequalities ' hold : @xmath163 in general @xmath147 will be empty if the four numbers @xmath31 corresponding to the faces of any one tetrahedron violate the tetrahedron inequalities . in this case",
    "the degenerate @xmath0 symbols vanish .",
    "similarly , the riemannian @xmath0 symbols vanish if the spins @xmath28 violate the tetrahedron inequalities  @xcite , and for the same sort of geometrical reason  @xcite .    for computational purposes",
    "it is helpful to rewrite the integral for the degenerate @xmath0 symbols in yet another way . to do this",
    ", first we note that we can exploit @xmath164 invariance to convert   to an integral over the 5-dimensional manifold @xmath165 , by rotating the @xmath157 in @xmath148 so that they lie in the 17-dimensional subspace where @xmath166 is fixed at @xmath167 , and @xmath168 lies in the @xmath169 half of the @xmath170-plane .",
    "this corresponds to integrating over all possible values for @xmath166 , inserting a factor equal to the volume of @xmath171 with our chosen measure , which is @xmath172 , and also integrating over all possible azimuthal coordinates for @xmath168 and inserting a factor of @xmath173 .    in what follows , we will choose coordinates so that the @xmath174 matrix @xmath175 whose determinant we require is block diagonal , with two @xmath176 blocks and one @xmath177 block .",
    "it turns out to be convenient to parameterise @xmath168 , not by its angle from the @xmath134-axis , but by the length @xmath178 since @xmath179 , these four vectors can be positioned to form the sides of a ( possibly non - planar ) quadrilateral .",
    "then @xmath180 is the length of one of the diagonals . with the vectors @xmath166 and @xmath168 fixed and the lengths of @xmath181 and @xmath182 specified , the only remaining freedom this quadrilateral has , if it is to remain closed , is the ` hinge angle ' , @xmath183 , between the two triangles that meet along the diagonal .",
    "the vectors @xmath181 and @xmath182 have 4 degrees of freedom in all , and specifying @xmath183 removes one of them , leaving 3 which break the quadrilateral . with our chosen measure on @xmath147 , the product of the measure for the coordinates we are integrating over , and",
    "the jacobian determinant for the 3 that break the quadrilateral , is : @xmath184 we can treat a second 4-tuple of vectors more or less identically .",
    "if the vector @xmath185 has an azimuthal angle of @xmath103 , and we define @xmath186 then the quadrilateral formed by @xmath187 and @xmath188 can be assigned a ` hinge angle ' of @xmath189 .",
    "this specifies all the degrees of freedom that allow this quadrilateral to remain closed .",
    "once again , the product of the measure for the coordinates we are integrating over , and the jacobian determinant for the 3 that break the quadrilateral , is : @xmath184 so far , we have specified 5 degrees of freedom for @xmath165 : @xmath180 , @xmath190 , @xmath183 , @xmath189 and @xmath103 .",
    "no further continuous degrees of freedom remain .",
    "the three vectors we have yet to specify must form triangles that complete two quadrilaterals with vectors that have already been parameterised , and because these two triangles have a vector in common , there is no ` hinge ' freedom left .    specifically , the three vectors @xmath191 and @xmath192 must form a tetrahedron by fitting over a triangular base that has , as two of its sides , the vectors : @xmath193 given their fixed lengths , this determines @xmath191 and @xmath192 completely , apart from the freedom to locate the apex of the tetrahedron on either side of the plane spanned by @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "this freedom can be accounted for with a factor of 2 in the integral .",
    "the final contribution to the jacobian comes from a @xmath177 block involving all the coordinates of @xmath191 and @xmath192 , and with our chosen measure this is : @xmath196 where @xmath197 is the volume of the tetrahedron as a function of its edge lengths .    combining these results",

    "e and f , the @xmath0 symbols have one or more vertices at the ` border of admissibility ' : that is , vertices where three of the spins labelling incident edges sum to equal the fourth spin , making one of the tetrahedron inequalities a strict equality . these vertices are marked with heavy dots on the legend .",
    "setting @xmath207 in   in these cases yields a coefficient of zero , because the domain for at least one variable of integration , the quadrilateral diagonal length @xmath180 , was reduced to a single point .",

    "while @xmath0 symbols with one or two vertices on the border of admissibility have @xmath208 asymptotics with spin rescaling , @xmath0 symbols with three or more vertices on the border of admissibility appear to decay exponentially as their spins are multiplied by @xmath7 , as illustrated in the log - linear plot below :        8em    1em    to prove convergence of the partition function in our newly formulated version of the barrett  crane model  @xcite , it will probably be necessary to understand the @xmath208 and exponential decay of borderline - admissible @xmath0 symbols under spin rescaling",

    "though the riemannian @xmath0 symbols are given by an integral over a product of copies of @xmath20 , we have seen that when we rescale the areas by a large constant @xmath7 , this integral is dominated by the contribution of a very small patch of this space , which can be approximated by a product of copies of @xmath2 .",
    "indeed , by a change of variables we can think of the @xmath8 limit as one in which the radius of @xmath20 approaches infinity , so that it degenerates to euclidean 3-space .    the riemannian @xmath0 symbols can also be described using the representation theory of @xmath1 , the isometry group of @xmath20 .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath8 asymptotics of the @xmath0 symbols can be described in terms of the representation theory of the euclidean group @xmath209 , the isometry group of @xmath2 .    to do this ,",
    "we introduce certain spin networks associated to @xmath209 which we call ` degenerate spin networks ' .",
    "these are more closely analogous to the lorentzian spin networks defined in  @xcite than to the riemannian spin networks we have been discussing so far , because the edge labels are not restricted to discrete values , and the group representations are infinite - dimensional .",
    "however , all three sorts of spin network form part of a unified theory , as outlined below : 1em 1em the rotation group @xmath1 and the lorentz group @xmath210 consist of linear transformations of @xmath21 with determinant 1 that preserve metrics of signature ( + + + + ) and ( @xmath211+++ ) , respectively . similarly , the euclidean group @xmath209 is isomorphic to the group of linear transformations of @xmath21 with determinant 1 that preserve the singly degenerate metric with signature ( @xmath61+++ ) .",

    "we do the same for lorentzian spin networks .",
    "we begin by describing degenerate spin networks and how to evaluate them .",
    "the representations @xmath17 labelling edges of a riemannian spin network are representations not just of @xmath215 , but actually of @xmath1 . as emphasized by freidel and krasnov @xcite , these representations are precisely the eigenspaces of the laplacian on @xmath20 , which is the homogeneous space @xmath216 .",
    "similarly , the representations labelling edges of a lorentzian spin network are the eigenspaces of the laplacian on hyperbolic 3-space , @xmath217  here we must take the connected component of the lorentz group to get just one sheet of the hyperboloid . following this pattern , the representations labelling edges of a degenerate spin network should be the eigenspaces of the laplacian on @xmath218 .",

    "defining an inner product on these solutions by @xmath221 we form a hilbert space @xmath222 consisting of all solutions @xmath48 with @xmath223 .",
    "this hilbert space becomes a representation of the euclidean group where each group element @xmath224 acts via @xmath225 .",

    "an intertwiner between tensor products of these representations can be defined at each vertex by taking the product of functions from the representations labelling the _ incoming _ edges , multiplying it by the product of complex conjugates of functions from representations labelling the _ outgoing _ edges , and integrating the result over @xmath2 . given this , the standard way to evaluate such a spin network",
    "@xcite would be to take a ` trace ' : that is , integrate over a basis label @xmath230 for each edge of the graph .",

    "<S> this amplitude is a function of the areas of the 10 faces of the 4-simplex , and barrett and williams have shown that one contribution to its asymptotics comes from the regge action for all non - degenerate 4-simplices with the specified face areas . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show numerically that the dominant contribution comes from degenerate 4-simplices . as a consequence </S>",
    "<S> , one can compute the asymptotics of the riemannian @xmath0 symbols by evaluating a ` degenerate spin network ' , where the rotation group @xmath1 is replaced by the euclidean group of isometries of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we conjecture formulas for the asymptotics of a large class of riemannian and lorentzian spin networks in terms of these degenerate spin networks , and check these formulas in some special cases . among other things </S>",
    "<S> , this conjecture implies that the lorentzian @xmath0 symbols are asymptotic to @xmath3 times the riemannian ones . </S>"
