    "cellular automata were introduced in the late 1940 s by von neumann as models of computation and of biological organisms  @xcite . we follow an algebraic treatment , as in  @xcite : let @xmath0 be a group .",
    "a _ cellular automaton _ carried by @xmath0 is a @xmath0-equivariant continuous map @xmath1 for some finite set @xmath2 .",
    "elements of @xmath3 are called _ configurations _ , and the action of @xmath0 on @xmath3 is given by @xmath4    one should think of @xmath2 as the stateset ( e.g.  `` '' or `` '' ) of a microscopic animal ; then @xmath3 is the stateset of a homogeneous swarm of animals indexed by @xmath0 , and @xmath5 is an evolution rule for the swarm : it is identical for each animal by @xmath0-equivariance , and is only based on local interaction by continuity of @xmath5 .",
    "for example , fixing @xmath6 the `` front '' , `` left '' and `` right '' neighbours , define @xmath5 by `` sleep if the guy in front of you sleeps , unless both your neighbours are awake '' , or in formul , set for all @xmath7 @xmath8 generally speaking , the _ memory set _ of a cellular automaton is the minimal @xmath9 such that @xmath10 depends only on the restriction of @xmath11 to @xmath12 , and is finite .    two properties of cellular automata received particular attention .",
    "let us call _ pattern _ the restriction of a configuration to a finite subset @xmath13 .",
    "on the one hand , there can exist patterns that never appear in the image of @xmath5 .",
    "these are called _ gardens of eden _ ( goe ) , the biblical metaphor expressing the notion of paradise the universe may start in but never return to .    on the other hand , @xmath5 can be non - injective in a strong sense : there can exist patterns @xmath14 such that , however one extends @xmath15 to a configuration @xmath16 , if one extends @xmath17 similarly ( i.e.  in such a way that @xmath16 and @xmath18 have the same restriction to @xmath19 ) then @xmath20 .",
    "these patterns @xmath21 are called _ mutually erasable patterns _ ( mep ) .",
    "equivalently there are two configurations @xmath22 which differ on a non - empty finite set and satisfy @xmath20 . the absence of mep is sometimes called _ pre - injectivity _  @xcite*8.g .",
    "amenability of groups was also introduced by von neumann , in the late 1920 s in  @xcite ; there exist numerous formulations ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , but we content ourselves with the following criterion due to flner ( see  @xcite ) which we treat as a definition : _ a discrete group @xmath0 is amenable if for every @xmath23 and every finite @xmath24 there exists a finite @xmath25 with @xmath26 . _ in words ,",
    "there exist finite subsets of @xmath0 that are arbitrarily close to invariant under translation .",
    "cellular automata were initially considered on @xmath27 .",
    "celebrated theorems by moore and myhill  @xcite prove that , in this context , a cellular automaton admits goe if and only if it admits mep ; necessity is due to myhill , and sufficiency to moore .",
    "this result was generalized by mach  and mignosi  @xcite to groups of subexponential growth , and by ceccherini - silberstein , mach  and scarabotti  @xcite to amenable groups .",
    "our main result is a converse to myhill s theorem :    [ thm : main ] let @xmath0 be a non - amenable group .",
    "then there exists a cellular automaton carried by @xmath0 that admits gardens of eden but no mutually erasable patterns .",
    "there is a natural measure , the _ bernoulli measure _",
    ", on the configuration space @xmath3 : for every pattern @xmath28 it assigns measure @xmath29 to the clopen set @xmath30 .",
    "note that the @xmath0-action on @xmath3 preserves this measure .",
    "hedlund proved in  @xcite*theorem  5.4 , for @xmath31 , that a cellular automaton preserves bernoulli measure if and only if it has no goe .",
    "this result was generalized by meyerovitch to amenable groups  @xcite*proposition  5.1 .    combining these with theorem  [ thm : main ] and with the aforementioned results by ceccherini - silberstein _ et al .",
    "_ and the main result of  @xcite , we deduce :    [ cor : main ] let @xmath0 be a group ; then the following are equivalent :    1 .",
    "the group @xmath0 is amenable;[cor:1 ] 2 .",
    "all cellular automata on @xmath0 that admit mep also admit goe;[cor:2 ] 3 .",
    "all cellular automata on @xmath0 that admit goe also admit mep;[cor:3 ] 4 .",
    "all cellular automata on @xmath0 that do not preserve bernoulli measure admit goe.[cor:4 ]      schupp had already asked in  @xcite*question  1 in which precise class of groups the theorems by moore and myhill hold .",
    "ceccherini - silberstein _ et al .",
    "_ conjecture in  @xcite*conjecture 6.2 that corollary  [ cor : main](13 ) are equivalent .",
    "the implication  ( 3@xmath321 ) is the content of theorem  [ thm : main ] . in case @xmath0",
    "contains a non - abelian free subgroup , it was already shown by muller in his university of illinois 1976 class notes , see  @xcite*page 55 ; let us review the construction , in the special case @xmath33 . fix a finite field @xmath34 , and set @xmath35 .",
    "view @xmath3 as @xmath36 , on which @xmath37 matrices with cofficients in the group ring @xmath38 act from the left",
    ". define @xmath39 by @xmath40 it obviously has gardens of eden  any pattern with non - trivial second cordinate  and to show that it has no mutually erasable patterns it suffices , since @xmath5 is linear , to show that @xmath5 is injective on finitely - supported configurations ; this is easily achieved by considering , in the support of a configuration @xmath11 , a position @xmath41 such that @xmath42 and @xmath43 do nt belong to the support of @xmath11 .",
    "i am very grateful to tullio ceccherini - silberstein and to alexei kanel - belov for entertaining conversations and encouragement , and to dawid kielak for having contributed an appendix to the text .",
    "we begin with a combinatorial    [ lem:1 ] let @xmath44 be an integer .",
    "then there exists a set @xmath45 and a family of subsets @xmath46 of @xmath45 such that , for all @xmath47 and all @xmath48 , we have @xmath49    we denote by @xmath50 the symmetric group on @xmath44 letters .",

    "let @xmath53 be the natural image of @xmath54 in the quotient @xmath45 .    first , there are @xmath55 cycles of length @xmath56 in @xmath57 , given by all cyclic orderings of @xmath58 ; so there are @xmath59 cycles of length @xmath56 in @xmath50 , and they can be completed in @xmath60 ways to a permutation of @xmath50 ; so @xmath61 since @xmath62 for all @xmath44 .    next ,",

    "then @xmath64 .",
    "summing over all possibilities for the length-@xmath65 cycle @xmath66 of @xmath67 intersecting @xmath68 in @xmath69 , we get @xmath70 combining   and  , we get @xmath71    let @xmath0 be a non - amenable group . to prove theorem  [ thm : main ] , we construct a cellular automaton carried by @xmath0 , with goe but without mep . since @xmath0 is non - amenable , there exists @xmath23 and @xmath72 finite with @xmath73 for all finite @xmath74 .",

    "we have @xmath86 furthermore , since @xmath87 these inequalities are sharp ; so we may replace @xmath45 and @xmath84 respectively by @xmath88 and @xmath89 for some @xmath77 large enough so that @xmath90 holds ; and then we replace @xmath45 by @xmath91 .",
    "if for @xmath92 and @xmath93 we define @xmath94 and furthermore we have obtained @xmath95 .",

    ", choose a linear map @xmath97 , and for @xmath98 denote by @xmath99 the composition of @xmath100 with the cordinate projection @xmath101 , in such a manner that , whenever @xmath102 is a family of subsets of @xmath81 with @xmath103 , we have @xmath104    this is always possible if @xmath34 is large enough : indeed write each @xmath100 as a @xmath105 matrix and each @xmath106 as a submatrix .",
    "the condition is then that various vertical concatenations of submatrices have full rank , and the complement of these conditions is a proper algebraic subvariety of @xmath107 defined over @xmath108 , which is not full as soon as @xmath34 is large enough .",
    "define now a cellular automaton with stateset @xmath2 and carrier @xmath0 by @xmath109    clearly @xmath5 admits gardens of eden : for every @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 .    to show that @xmath5 admits mutually erasable patterns , it is enough to show , for @xmath110 non - trivial and finitely supported , that @xmath112 .",
