    "physico - chemical models describing the processes involved in converting concentrations of specific rna or dna targets hybridised onto oligonucleotide microarrays to observed fluorescence intensities have become commonplace  @xcite .",
    "the ultimate aim of such models has in general been to provide biologists with practical algorithms for estimating absolute specific target concentrations in the presence of a complex non - specific background from fluorescence intensity data .",
    "early models inspired by langmuir adsorption theory , which applied standard physical chemistry to the hybridisation of specific and non - specific targets to the microarray surface , predicted a hyperbolic response function  @xcite which has been verified with reasonable accuracy  @xcite for the affymetrix u95a latin square spike - in experiment  @xcite .",
    "refinements of the model to include the effects of probe and target folding and bulk hybridisation in the supernatant solution  @xcite maintain the hyperbolic shape of the response function while decreasing the effective adsorption rate constant . including the effects of post - hybridisation washing  @xcite also maintains the hyperbolic shape of the response function and is able to explain an asymptotic response in the limit of high target concentrations which is below full saturation of the probe feature and decreases with probe - target binding affinity  @xcite .",
    "the above physico - chemical models generally assume that the concentration of target molecules in the supernatant solution is not appreciably depleted by the hybridisation reaction . however , in order to explain their data from spike in experiments which run to very low spike - in concentratons  @xcite , ono et al .",
    "@xcite have recently extended the accepted adsorption model to include such target depletion effects .",
    "their model predicted an interesting saturation effect which was borne out by experiment . as well as the usual saturation effect ,",
    "in which the number of available probe molecules becomes exhausted in the limit of high target concentration for a fixed probe type , a second saturation effect occurs when the number of target molecules is exhausted in the limit of high binding affinity at fixed target concentration .",
    "this limit was realised by including on a custom - built microarray a series of features of increasing probe length .    in the current paper",
    "we extend the ono model by identifying two types of target depletion , which we term `` local depletion '' and `` global depletion '' . by local depletion",
    "we mean that depletion of target molecules in the supernatant solution by a hybridisation to a given probe feature only affects that particular probe feature .",
    "this is essentially ono et al.s `` finite hybridisation model '' .",
    "this regime is relevant when diffusion and/or convection of targets is slow compared with the hybridisation and probe features responsive to the same target species are spatially separated on the microarray . by global depletion",
    "we mean that all probe features responding to a given target species are mutually affected by depletion of that species from the supernatant solution .",
    "global depletion is relevant for spatially separated features undergoing permanent agitation of the hybridisation solution , if equilibrium includes rapid diffusion of transcripts through the microarray cartridge , or for neighbouring features such as the perfect match / mismatch ( pm / mm ) probes on the older designs of affymetrix genechips .",
    "we fit the models to two spike - in datasets .",
    "the first , that of suzuki et al .",
    "@xcite , which covers a broad range of spike - in concentrations and probe lengths and for which we verify that the local model , not the global model , is relevant , is dealt with in section  [ suzukidataanalysis ] .",
    "the second , the u133a affymetrix latin square data set  @xcite , for which the global model is appropriate , is dealt with in section  [ affydataanalysis ] . for this data",
    "set we find that the global model of depletion entails a substantial improvement on earlier reported fits by a hyperbolic response function  @xcite . as well as",
    "fitting response functions or so - called `` isotherms '' , we analyse the data sets in terms of the recently developed hook curve formalism  @xcite designed for the calibration of microarrays whose design includes pm / mm pairs .",
    "the hook curve method turns out to be a clear and easily implemented indicator of which depletion regime , local or global , is relevant to a particular dataset .",
    "full details of our local and global depletion models , including specific and non - specific hybridisation of target molecules to probes at the microarray surface and of targets within the supernatant solution and the folding of target and probe molecules , are set out in [ sec : pcmodel ] .",
    "some technical details of the analysis of the global depletion model are given in [ sec : isoshape ] .",
    "other than the work of ono et al .  and",
    "a related project  @xcite , we are aware of only one other extensive attempt to incorporate target depletion from the supernatant solution during hybridisation into a physico - chemical model of microarrays , namely a recent publication by li et al .  @xcite . in section",
    "[ sec : criteval ] we give a critical evaluation pointing out a number of errors in the li et al .",
    "model , with details given in [ sec : licritique ] .",
    "suzuki et al .  @xcite have carried out experiments in which a set of 150 cdna target sequences , with and without a complex background , are hybridised onto custom arrays containing features with probes ranging in length from @xmath0 14 to 25 dna bases .",
    "the probe designs include perfect matches and mismatches , the mismatches being in each possible position ( @xmath1 and of each possible nucleotide .",
    "spike - in concentrations covered a broad range from 1.4  fm to 1.4  nm .",
    "the purpose of the experiment was to determine probe lengths and mismatch positions which optimise the discrimination between pm and mm signals .",
    "because the spike - in concentrations run to very low values , depletion can not be ignored  @xcite .",
    "of the two physico - chemical models described in [ sec : pcmodel ] , we demonstrate below that this data set is an example of local rather than global target depletion .",
    "this result is reasonable : the large set of pm and mm probes addressing any one target species must extend over distances large compared with the nearest neighbour distance on the chip .",
    "the remaining question , which we settle below in favour of local depletion , is whether diffusion or convection of target molecules is slow ( local depletion ) or fast ( global depletion ) relative to the rate of hybridisation .      for the case of local depletion ,",
    "the coverage fraction @xmath2 of fluorescent dye carrying target molecules bound to a given probe feature at the microarray surface is shown in [ sec : alocaldepletion ] to be @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the spiked - in probe - specific target concentration , @xmath5 is an effective molar concentration of probe molecules immobilised on the microarray surface , @xmath6 , called the non - specific binding strength , is a dimensionless measure of the degree of non - specfic binding and @xmath7 is an effective equilibrium constant for the binding of specific targets accounting for several chemical reactions including surface and bulk hybridisation and molecular folding .",
    "the coverage fraction @xmath8 of specific targets only is given by eq .",
    "( [ thetasfromquad ] ) .",
    "the model of [ sec : alocaldepletion ] also allows for the consideration of post - hybridisation washing , which is signalled by differing responses of pm and mm features to saturation target concentrations  @xcite .",
    "there seems to be little evidence that washing is significant for this dataset ( see figure  [ fig : suzukidata ] ) , and for convenience we set the washing survival factors to unity in the current analysis .",
    "the log of the effective equilibrium constant @xmath7 is expected to be approximately proportional to probe length .",
    "this follows from the definition eq .",
    "( [ ksdeflocal1 ] ) and the relationship @xmath9 relating the hybridisation constant to free binding energy @xmath10 , which is well approximated by the santalucia nearest neighbour stacking model  @xcite .",
    "ono et al .",
    "@xcite make use of this result to consider isotherms relating coverage fraction to probe length , which we reproduce from the theoretical local depletion model in the left panel of figure  [ fig : theoisothermlocal ] . in calculating these curves we use an assumption that the ratio @xmath11 is independent of probe length .",
    "this is justified since @xmath12 where @xmath13 is , on average , independent of probe length by virtue of the nearest neighbour stacking model .    .",
    "each curve represents the response of the coverage fraction @xmath14 to variations of the specific binding strength for the pm probes , @xmath15 at fixed specific target concentration @xmath4 . since @xmath16 free binding energy of hybridisaton ( see text ) , the horizontal scale in the isotherm plot can be thought of as a measure of probe length .",
    "input parameters are : @xmath17 as indicated by colour in the legend ; @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "isotherms for pm probes are plotted as solid lines , and for mm probes as dashed liines . ]",
    "two saturation behaviours in the limit of large probe length , or high binding strength @xmath20 , are immediately apparent . from eqs .",
    "( [ thetan2 ] ) and ( [ thetasfromquad ] ) one obtains @xmath21 in the case @xmath22 , where the concentration of specific target exceeds the effective concentration of probes , the probes become saturated ( @xmath23 ) and any residual unbound targets remain in solution . in the case @xmath24 , where the probe concentration exceeds that of the targets , the free targets are completely depleted and the maximum fluorescence intensity decreases with decreasing target concentration ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "note also that for any pm / mm pair , the saturation intensity depends only on specific target concentration and not on the presence of mismatches .",
    "also shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : theoisothermlocal ] are the predicted hook curves for varying probe length in the case of local depletion .",
    "the hook curve method  @xcite was originally developed to analyse data from microarrays whose design includes pm / mm pairs , but can be applied to any pair of probe features addressing the same specific target .",
    "the method processes the pm / mm intensities @xmath26 and @xmath27 using the transformation @xmath28 where , for affymetrix genechips , the angular brackets denote averaging over probes within a probeset . smoothing the @xmath29 versus",
    "@xmath30 plot provides a hook curve , whose characteristic shape typically assumes the concave downwards curve shown in figure  [ fig : theoisothermlocal ] .    in previous implementations",
    "@xcite the hook curve has been considered as a trajectory in the @xmath30-@xmath29 plane as the specific binding strength @xmath20 varies due to changes in specific target concentration @xmath4 while the binding affinity @xmath7 is held fixed . for the suzuki data set we use",
    "a _ different _ and more appropriate implementation which specifically exploits the broad range of binding affinities arising from probe lengths which vary from 14 to 25 mer .",
    "that is , figure  [ fig : theoisothermlocal ] plots the hook curve as a trajectory traced out by varying binding affinity @xmath7 at fixed values of target concentration @xmath4 .",
    "the left hand end of the hook curve ( @xmath31 ) is determined by non - specific hybridisation and will not vary significantly with probe length .",
    "the right hand end of the hook curve ( @xmath32 ) is determined by the saturation intensity , and is expected to shift leftwards for subcritical specific target concentrations @xmath24 .    by contrast , the theoretical isotherms and hook curves for the case of global depletion are shown in figure  [ fig : theoisothermglobal ] . for a given probe feature @xmath33 , the theoretical isotherm , derived in [ sec : aglobaldepletion ] , is now ( see eq .",
    "( [ thetasolnp ] ) ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the sum total of specific target coverage fractions over all probe features addressing the relevant target species , and is determined by an equation analogous to eq .",
    "( [ thetasump ] ) . for illustrative purposes the curves in figure  [ fig : theoisothermglobal ]",
    "are calculated for the case of a single pm / mm pair of probe features addressing the target in question .",
    "two differences with the local depletion case are immediately apparent .",
    "firstly , since the depleted targets are shared among more than one probe feature , the asymptotic behaviour of the isotherms at subcritical concentrations differs between different probes addressing the the same target species ( i.e.  @xmath36 ) .",
    "secondly , the shape of the hook curve remains unchanged as the probe length varies by the following argument .",
    "since we use an assumption that @xmath11 is independent of probe length , one can think of the hook curve as being parameterised by the variable @xmath37 where @xmath38 has some functional dependence on @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath39 and the fixed ratio @xmath11 .",
    "changing the value of @xmath4 then simply effects an identical reparameterisaton in this variable of both @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "individual points will migrate along the path of the hook curve , and at subcritical concentrations the curve will be truncated at the right hand end at different points , but otherwise the shape of the hook curve remains unchanged .    .",
    "the input parameters and curve conventions are the same as for figure  [ fig : theoisothermlocal ] . also shown in the right panel",
    "are the right hand end points of individual hook curves indicated by a @xmath42 sign .",
    "as explained in the text , the shape of the hook curve remains unchanged as @xmath4 varies , except that the curve terminates at different right hand points at subcritical concentrations .",
    "hook curves for all values of @xmath17 start at the same left hand point .",
    "note that the critical value of specific concentration , below which the isotherm saturates at @xmath43 now occurs at a value @xmath44 as the depleted targets are shared among more than one probe feature . ]",
    "the suzuki spike - in experiment  @xcite includes spike - in runs of 150 cdna target sequences both with and without a complex background . to keep the analysis simple we analyse only the data set without a complex background .",

    "thus each plotted data point is an average over 450 raw intensities.some sort of averaging over probe sequences to account for the dependence of binding affinity on individual probe sequences was necessary in order to separate out the dependence on probe length .",
    "this is handled in the implementation of the hook curve for affymetrix chips by correcting intensities with position- and nucleotide - dependent sensitivity profiles determined from intensity distributions over the whole array  @xcite .",
    "however , this method can not be used for the suzuki data set as each array contains a range of probe lengths , making it difficult to define meaningful sensitivity profiles .",
    "the use of average logged intensities rather than averaged intensities was an appropriate and simple solution accounting for the fact that microarray data is generally observed to have multiplicative errors .",
