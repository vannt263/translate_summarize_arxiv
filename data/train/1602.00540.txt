    "in this paper we establish quantitative properties of minimizers and stable sets of nonlocal interaction functionals of perimeter type .",
    "we consider very general possibly anisotropic and not scaling invariant functionals including , as particular cases , the fractional @xmath0-perimeter and its anisotropic version , introduced respectively in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the results that we obtain can be grouped , roughly speaking , into the following categories :    * local @xmath1-estimates ( universal bounds for the classical perimeter ) and sharp energy estimates for minimizers and stable sets , * existence results and compactness of minimizers , * quantitative flatness results .    before giving the most general statements of the results in the paper , we just state them for the case of fractional @xmath0-perimeter . even in this very particular case ,",
    "the results are new and interesting in themselves .",
    "the precise setting of the ( most general ) nonlocal perimeter functionals that we consider will be discussed in subsection  [ setting ] . in particular , in the forthcoming definitions  [ minim ] and  [ stable ] we precise the notions of _ minimizers _ and _ stable sets_. our results are stated in their full generality later on in subsection  [ ris : s ] after having given in subsection  [ r : w : m ] several concrete motivations for the problems under consideration .",
    "we next state , in the case of the @xmath0-perimeter , our main @xmath1-estimate .",
    "this result is a particular case of our theorem [ thmstable ] .",
    "it gives a universal bound on the classical perimeter in @xmath4 of any stable minimal set in @xmath3 .",
    "as said above , the precise notion of stable solution will be given in definition  [ stable ] , and it is an appropriate weak formulation of the nonnegativity of the second variation of the functional .",
    "[ 89:th ] let @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 be a stable set in the ball  @xmath12 for the nonlocal @xmath0-perimeter functional .",
    "then , the classical perimeter of  @xmath11 in  @xmath7 is bounded by  @xmath13 , where @xmath14 depends only on @xmath15 and @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , the @xmath0-perimeter of  @xmath11 in  @xmath7 is bounded by  @xmath16 .    moreover , as a consequence of theorem [ thmstable ] , we establish the same result for the anisotropic fractional perimeter considered in @xcite . to better appreciate theorem [ 89:th ]",
    "let us compare it with the best known similar results for classical minimal surfaces .",
    "a universal perimeter estimate for ( local ) stable minimal surfaces is only known for the case of _ two - dimensional _ stable minimal surfaces that are _ simply connected _ and _ immersed _ in @xmath5 .",
    "conversely , the perimeter estimate in our theorem [ 89:th ] holds in every dimension and without topological constraints . the perimeter estimate for the classical case",
    "is a result due to pogorelov @xcite , and colding and minicozzi @xcite see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 34 ) , it reads as follows    [ classical ] let @xmath17 be a simply connected , immersed , stable minimal disk of geodesic radius @xmath18 on a minimal ( two - dimensional ) surface @xmath19 , then @xmath20    as said above , our estimate for nonlocal perimeters is stronger in the sense that we do not need @xmath21 to be simply connected and immersed .",
    "in fact , an estimate exactly like ours can not hold for classical stable minimal surfaces since a large number of parallel planes is always a classical stable minimal surface with arbitrarily large perimeter in @xmath3 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ classical ] uses crucially the fact that for two - dimensional minimal surfaces the sum of the squares of the principal curvatures @xmath22 equals @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the gau curvature since on a minimal surface @xmath25 .",
    "then , the stability inequality reads as @xmath26 . by plugging a suitable radial test function @xmath27 in this stability inequality , using the gau - bonnet formula to relate @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and integrating by parts in the radial variable ,",
    "one proves the bound @xmath30 .",
    "this elegant proof is unfortunately quite rigid and only applies to two - dimensional surfaces .    having a universal bound for the classical perimeter of embedded minimal surfaces in every dimension @xmath31 would be a decisive step towards proving the following well - known and long standing conjecture : _ the only stable embedded minimal ( hyper)surfaces in @xmath32 are hyperplanes as long as the dimension of the ambient space is less than or equal to 7_. indeed",
    ", it would open the door to use the monotonicity formula to prove that blow - downs of stable surfaces are stable minimal cones which are completely classified . on the other hand , without a universal perimeter bound",
    ", the sequence of blow - downs could have perimeters converging to @xmath33 .",
    "in the same direction , we believe that our result in theorem [ 89:th ] can be used to reduce the classification of stable @xmath0-minimal surfaces in the whole @xmath32 to the classification of stable cones    we note that our nonlocal estimate gives a control on the classical perimeter ( i.e. the @xmath1-norm of the characteristic function ) , which is stronger both from the geometric and functional space perspective than a control on the @xmath0-perimeter ( i.e. on the @xmath34 norm of the characteristic function ) .",
    "the sharp @xmath0-perimeter estimate stated in theorem [ 89:th ] is obtained as a consequence of the estimate for the classical perimeter using a standard interpolation .    since it is well - known @xcite that the classical perimeter is the limit as @xmath35 of the nonlocal @xmath0-perimeter ( suitably renormalized ) , it is natural to ask whether our results give some informations in the limit case @xmath36 .",
    "unfortunately , our proof relies strongly on the nonlocal character of the @xmath0-perimeter and the constant @xmath14 appearing in theorem [ 89:th ] blows up as @xmath35 .",
    "the more general forms of our @xmath1-estimates have quite remarkable consequences regarding the existence and compactness of minimizers see theorem [ existence ] and lemma [ compactness ] .",
    "these existence and compactness results are nontrivial since they apply in particular to some perimeter functionals that are finite on every measurable set .",
    "thus , although all the perimeter functionals that we consider are lower semicontinuous , sequences of sets of finite perimeter are in principle not compact in @xmath37 .",
    "thanks to our @xmath1-estimates , we can obtain robust compactness results that serve to prove existence of minimizers in a very general framework .",
    "we next give our quantitative flatness estimate in dimension @xmath38 for the case of the @xmath0-perimeter .",
    "this result is a particular case of our theorem [ aniso ] .",
    "it states that stable sets in a large ball @xmath7 are close to being a halfplane in @xmath3 , with a quantitative control on the measure of the symmetric difference that decays to @xmath39 as @xmath40 .",
    "[ t : ex2 ] let the dimension of the ambient space be equal to  @xmath41 .",
    "let  @xmath42 and  @xmath11 be a stable set in the ball  @xmath43 for the @xmath0-perimeter .",
    "then , there exists a halflplane  @xmath44 such that @xmath45 .",
    "moreover , after a rotation , we have that  @xmath46 is the graph of a measurable function  @xmath47 with @xmath48 outside a `` bad '' set  @xmath49 with measure @xmath50 .",
    "the previous result provides a quantitative version of the classification result in @xcite which says that if @xmath11 is a minimizer of the @xmath0-perimeter in any compact set of @xmath51 , then it is necessarily a halfplane .",
    "moreover , theorem  [ t : ex2 ] extends this classification result to the class of stable sets .    in corollary  [ thm1dim3 ]",
    "we will obtain also results in dimension @xmath52 for minimizers of anisotropic interactions with a finite range of dependence ( i.e. for `` truncated kernels '' ) .",
    "the proofs of our main results have , as starting point , a nontrivial refinement of the variational argument introduced by savin and one of the authors in @xcite to prove that halfplanes are the only cones minimizing the @xmath0-fractional perimeter in every compact set of @xmath51 .",
    "namely , we consider perturbations @xmath53 of a minimizer @xmath11 which coincide with @xmath11 outside @xmath7 and are translations @xmath54 of @xmath11 in @xmath55 with `` infinitesimal '' @xmath56 .",
    "a first step in the proof is estimating how much @xmath57 differs from @xmath58 depending on @xmath8 this is done in lemma [ lem2a ] . by exploiting the nonlocality of the perimeter functional , the previous control on @xmath59",
    "is translated into a control on the minimum between @xmath60 and @xmath61 the crucial estimates for this are given in lemmas [ lemefdelta ] and [ lemeftdelta ] .",
    "then , a careful geometric analysis allows us to deduce our main results i.e .",
    "theorems [ thmstable ] , [ bv - est ] , [ aniso ] , [ flatness ] and their corollaries .",
    "we emphasize that we always use _ arbitrarily small _ perturbations of our set @xmath11 .",
    "that is why we can establish some results for _ stable _ sets .    in the following subsections ,",
    "we introduce the mathematical framework of nonlocal perimeters , we discuss some motivations for this general framework , and we present the main results obtained .      the notion of fractional perimeter was introduced in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath62 .",
    "given a bounded domain @xmath63 , we define the fractional @xmath0-perimeter of a measurable set @xmath64 relative to @xmath65 as @xmath66 where @xmath67 denotes the complement of @xmath11 in @xmath32 and the interaction @xmath68 of two disjoint measurable sets @xmath69 is defined by @xmath70 roughly speaking , this @xmath0-perimeter captures the interactions between a set  @xmath11 and its complement .",
    "these interactions occur in the whole of the space and are weighted by a ( homogeneous and rotationally invariant ) kernel with polynomial decay ( see figure 1 ) . here , the role of the domain  @xmath65 is to `` select '' the contributions which arise in a given portion of the space and to `` remove '' possible infinite contributions to the energy which come from infinity but which do not change the variational problem .",
    "a set @xmath11 is said to minimize the @xmath0-perimeter in @xmath65 if @xmath71 the ( boundaries of the ) minimizers of the @xmath0-perimeter are often called nonlocal minimal ( or @xmath0-minimal ) surfaces .    in this paper , we study a more general functional , in which the interaction kernel is not necessarily homogeneous and rotational invariant .",
    "we consider a kernel  @xmath24 satisfying @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74 and @xmath75    to prove our main results we will require the following additional assumption on the first and second derivatives of the kernel @xmath24 : @xmath76 for all @xmath77 and for all @xmath78 , for some kernel @xmath79 .    throughout the paper we will have one of the three following cases :    * @xmath80 ; * @xmath81 for some @xmath82 ; * @xmath83 .    we emphasize that the kernels of the fractional @xmath0-perimeter and its anisotropic version satisfy with @xmath84",
    ". therefore , a reader interested in the results for these particular cases , can mentally replace @xmath79 by @xmath85 in all the paper .",
    "we allow the second case of @xmath79 in order to obtain results for compactly supported kernels , as for example @xmath86 . with the third case",
    ", we will be able to obtain strong results for nonsingular kernels like @xmath87 .",
    "we set @xmath88    we define , for a measurable set @xmath64 , the @xmath24-perimeter of @xmath11 in @xmath32 as @xmath89    we define the @xmath24-perimeter of @xmath11 inside @xmath65 , @xmath90 similarly as in with @xmath91 replacing @xmath68 .",
    "that is , @xmath92 note that our definition of @xmath90 agrees with the one of @xmath93 given in ( * ? ? ?",

    "we next formally state the definition of minimizer of the @xmath24-perimeter .",
    "[ minim ] we say that @xmath11 is a _ minimizer _ for @xmath97 in an open bounded set @xmath65 , if @xmath98 and @xmath99 for any set @xmath100 which coincides with @xmath11 outside @xmath65 , that is @xmath101 .",
    "we also define the notion of stable set for the @xmath24-perimeter .    [ stable ]",
    "we say that @xmath11 is a _",
    "stable set _ for @xmath97",

    ", we have @xmath108 and @xmath109 for all @xmath110 .    for our second theorem we will consider kernels @xmath24 in the class @xmath111 introduced by caffarelli and silvestre in @xcite ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "namely , the kernels @xmath112 satisfying , @xmath113 and @xmath114 for all @xmath77 and for all @xmath78 .",
    "note that , after multiplying a kernel @xmath115 by a positive constant , we may assume that @xmath116 and hence @xmath24 satisfies  with @xmath117 .",
    "a very relevant particular case to which our results apply is that of @xmath0-fractional anisotropic perimeters , introduced in @xcite .",
    "this case corresponds to the choice of the kernel @xmath118 where @xmath119 is some positive , even @xmath120 function on the @xmath121-dimensional unit sphere @xmath122 ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "the notion of anisotropic nonlocal perimeter was considered in @xcite , where some asymptotic results for @xmath123 where established .      to favor a concrete intuition of the nonlocal perimeter functional , we now recall some practical applications of the nonlocal perimeter functionals . in these applications , it is also natural to consider interactions that are not homogeneous or rotationally invariant .",
    "* a. * the first application that we present is related to image processing and bitmaps .",
    "let us consider the framework of bmp type images with square pixels of ( small ) size  @xmath124 ( and suppose that  @xmath125 for simplicity ) . for simplicity ,",
    "let us consider a picture of a square of side  @xmath126 , with sides at  @xmath127 with respect to the orientation of the pixels and let us compare with the `` version '' of the square which is represented in the image ( see figure  2 ) .    in this configuration ,",
    "the classical perimeter functional provides a rather inaccurate tool to analyze this picture , no matter how small the pixels are , i.e. no matter how good is the image resolution .    indeed , the perimeter of the ideal square is  @xmath128 , while the perimeter of the picture displayed by the monitor is always  @xmath129 ( independently on the smallness of  @xmath130 ) , so the classical perimeter is always producing an error by a factor  @xmath131 , even in cases of extremely high resolution .    instead , the fractional perimeter ( for instance with @xmath132 ) or other nonlocal perimeters would provide a much better approximation of the classical perimeter of the ideal square in the case of high image resolution .",
    "indeed , the discrepancy  @xmath133 between the @xmath0-perimeter of the ideal square and the @xmath0-perimeter of the pixelled square is bounded by above by the sum of the interactions between the `` boundary pixels '' with their complement : these pixels are the ones which intersect the boundary of the original square , and their number is  @xmath134 .    by scaling ,",
    "the interaction of one pixel with its complement is of the order of  @xmath135 , therefore we obtain that  @xmath136 , which is infinitesimal as  @xmath137 .    since the fractional perimeter ( suitably normalized ) is close to the classical one as @xmath138 , that the fractional perimeter provides in this case a more precise information that the classical one .    *",
    "b. * another main motivation for the study of nonlocal @xmath0-minimal surfaces , as explained in @xcite , is the understanding of steady states for nonlinear interface evolution processes with lvy diffusion .",

    "@xmath151 ) .    an extreme version of this evolution process , heuristically corresponding to a huge balanced @xmath147 like @xmath152 with @xmath153",

    "heuristically , a set @xmath11 with smooth enough boundary will be stationary under the flow @xmath168 ( with infinitesimal @xmath160 ) if and only if its density function @xmath143 satisfies @xmath169 indeed , in this way the evolution @xmath170 will be @xmath171 on @xmath21 for @xmath172 , and the boundary points will not move .",
    "note that this heuristic argument is independent of the modulus of continuity @xmath173 .    in some cases , under an appropriate choice of @xmath174 the discrete flow @xmath166 can be shown to converge to some continuous flow as @xmath175 .",
    "when @xmath176 is the laplacian , under the choice @xmath177 the @xmath166 converges to the mean curvature flow .",

    "pires and souganidis study the convergence of general threshold dynamics type approximation schemes to hypersurfaces moving with normal velocity depending on the normal direction and the curvature tensor .",
    "finally , in @xcite , the case @xmath178 was considered : in this case @xmath166 still converges to the mean curvature flow for @xmath179 with @xmath180 and for @xmath36 with @xmath173 implicitly defined @xmath181 for @xmath160 small .    instead , for @xmath9 and @xmath182 , the discrete flow @xmath166 with @xmath178 converges to a new geometric flow : the @xmath0-nonlocal mean curvature flow ( see @xcite , theorem 1 ) a flow where the normal displacement is proportional to the nonlocal mean curvature ; see also @xcite .",

    "one consider the energy functional @xmath186 where @xmath187 is a double well potential representing the dislocation energy , and the first term , involving @xmath188 , penalizes the formation of unnecessary interfaces .",
    "the classical @xmath189-convergence result by modica and mortola @xcite states that the energy functional @xmath190 @xmath189-converges to the ( classical ) perimeter functional .",
    "a nonlocal analogue of is the following @xmath191 where @xmath192 the previous energy functional models long range ( or nonlocal ) interactions between the particles the density of particles at a point is influenced by the density at other points that may be not infinitesimally close .",
