    "we work within the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) enlarged by three right handed neutrinos and their susy partners , where potentially observable lfv effects in the charged lepton sector are expected to occur .",
    "we further assume a seesaw mechanism for neutrino mass generation and use the parameterisation @xmath7 , with @xmath8 defined by @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) ; @xmath11 , @xmath12 gev ; @xmath13 denotes the three light neutrino masses , and @xmath14 the three heavy ones .",
    "@xmath15 is given by the three ( light ) neutrino mixing angles @xmath16 and @xmath17 , and three phases , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "with this parameterisation it is easy to accommodate the neutrino data , while leaving room for extra neutrino mixings ( from the right handed sector ) .",
    "it further allows for large yukawa couplings @xmath20 by choosing large entries in @xmath21 and/or @xmath9 .",
    "here we focus in the particular lfv proccesses : 1 ) semileptonic @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath25 ( @xmath5 ) decays and 2 ) @xmath6 conversion in heavy nuclei . the predictions in the following are for two different constrained mssm - seesaw scenarios , with universal and non - universal higgs soft masses .",
    "the respective parameters ( in addition to the previous neutrino sector parameters ) are : 1 ) cmssm - seesaw : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29 , and sign(@xmath30 ) , and 2 ) nuhm - seesaw : @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 @xmath29 , sign(@xmath30 ) , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the predictions presented here for the @xmath6 conversion rates include the full set of susy one - loop contributing diagrams , mediated by @xmath33 , z , and higgs bosons , as well as boxes , and do not use the leading logarithmic ( llog ) nor the mass insertion approximations . in the case of semileptonic tau",
    "decays we have not included the boxes which are clearly subdonimant .",
    "the hadronisation of quark bilinears is performed within the chiral framework , using chiral perturbation theory and resonance chiral theory .",
    "this is a very short summary of the works in  @xcite and  @xcite to which we refer the reader for more details .",
    "here we present the predictions for br(@xmath0 ) ( @xmath1 ) , br(@xmath2 ) ( @xmath3 ) , br(@xmath4 ) ( @xmath5 ) and cr(@xmath6 , nuclei ) within the previously described framework and compare them with the following experimental bounds : br@xmath34 , br@xmath35 , br@xmath36 , br@xmath37 , br@xmath38 , br@xmath39 , br@xmath40 , cr@xmath41 and cr@xmath42 .    as a general result in lfv processes that can be mediated by higgs bosons",
    "we have found that the @xmath43 and @xmath44 contributions are relevant at large @xmath45 if the higgs masses are light enough .",
    "it is in this aspect where the main difference between the two considered scenarios lies . within the cmssm ,",
    "light higgs @xmath43 and @xmath44 bosons are only possible for low @xmath46 ( here we take @xmath47 to reduce the number of input parameters ) .",
    "in contrast , within the nuhm , light higgs bosons can be obtained even at large @xmath46 . in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] it is shown that some specific choices of @xmath48 and @xmath49 lead to values of @xmath50 and @xmath51 as low as 110 - 120 gev , even for heavy @xmath46 values above 600 gev .",
    "therefore , the sensitivity to the higgs sector is higher in the nuhm .",
    "we start by presenting the results for the semileptonic tau decays .",
    "the mentioned sensitivity to the higgs sector within the nuhm scenario can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "concretely , the brs of the channels @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 present a growing behaviour with @xmath46 , in the large @xmath58 region , due to the contribution of light higgs bosons , which is non - decoupling .",
    "the decays involving kaons and @xmath59 mesons are particularly sensitive to the higgs contributions because of their strange quark content , which has a stronger coupling to the higgs bosons . on the other hand ,",
    "the largest predicted rates are for @xmath60 and @xmath61 , dominated by the photon contribution , which are indeed at the present experimental reach in the low @xmath46 region .",
    "the maximum sensitivity to the higgs sector is found for @xmath62 and @xmath57 channels , largely dominated by the @xmath44 boson exchange .",
    "[ fig:3 ] shows that br(@xmath62 ) reaches the experimental bound for large heaviest neutrino mass , large @xmath45 , large @xmath9 angles and low @xmath51 . for the choice of input parameters in this figure",
    ", it occurs at @xmath63 gev , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 gev .",
    "a set of useful formulae for all these channels , within the mass insertion approximation which are valid at large @xmath45 , are presented in  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the predictions with these formulae agree with the full results within a factor of about 2 . in the case of @xmath62",
    "this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "similar conclusions are found for @xmath67 .",
    "the next relevant channel in sensitivity to the higgs sector is @xmath52 , but it is still below the present experimental bound . to our knowledge , there are not experimental bounds yet available for @xmath68 and @xmath54 .",
    "next we comment on the results for @xmath6 conversion in nuclei .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows our predictions of the conversion rates for titanium as a function of @xmath46 in both cmssm and nuhm scenarios . as in the case of semileptonic",
    "tau decays , the sensitivity to the higgs contribution is only manifest in the nuhm scenario .",
    "the predictions for cr(@xmath6 , ti ) within the cmssm scenario are largely dominated by the photon contribution and present a decoupling behaviour at large @xmath46 . in this case",
    "the present experimental bound is only reached at low @xmath46 .",
    "the perspectives for the future are much more promising .",
    "if the announced sensitivity by prism / prime of @xmath69 is finally attained , the full studied range of @xmath46 will be covered .",
    "[ fig:4 ] also illustrates that within the nuhm scenario the higgs contribution dominates at large @xmath46 for light higgs bosons .",
    "the predicted rates are close to the present experimental bound not only in the low @xmath46 region but also for heavy susy spectra . as in the previous semileptonic tau",
    "decays , we have found in addition a simple formula for the conversion rates , within the mass insertion approximation , which is valid at large @xmath45  @xcite and can be used for further analysis .",
    "the predictions of the @xmath6 conversion rates for several nuclei are collected in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",
    "we can see again the growing behaviour with @xmath46 in the large @xmath46 region due to the non - decoupling of the higgs contributions . at present ,",
    "the most competitive nucleus for lfv searches is au where , for the choice of input parameters in this figure , all the predicted rates are above the experimental bound .",
    "we have also shown in  @xcite that @xmath6 conversion in nuclei is extremely sensitive to @xmath17 , similarly to @xmath70 and @xmath71 and , therefore , a future measurement of this mixing angle can help in the searches of lfv in the @xmath6 sector .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that semileptonic tau decays nicely complement the searches for lfv in the @xmath72 sector , in addition to @xmath73 .",
    "the future prospects for @xmath6 conversion in ti are the most promising for lfv searches .",
    "both processes , semileptonic tau decays and @xmath6 conversion in nuclei are indeed more sensitive to the higgs sector than @xmath74 ."
