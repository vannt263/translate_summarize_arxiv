    "as seen in fig .  [ f : intro:1](a ) , asphalt mixtures represent in general a highly heterogeneous material with complex microstructure consisting at minimum of mastic binder , aggregates and voids .",
    "when limiting our attention to mastic asphalt mixtures , used typically in traffic arteries of substantial importance , the fraction of voids becomes negligible . a binary image of such a two - phase material system plotted in fig .",
    "[ f : intro:1](b ) is then readily available .",
    "the literature offers several distinct routes taking advantage of such a representation .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     regarding the `` similarity '' of macroscopic response from various sepucs , the sepuc no .",
    "37 was selected to provide data needed in the calibration of the macroscopic gl model .",
    "virtual numerical tests identical to those in section  [ bsec : leonov - mortar ] were again performed to give first the homogenized master curve displayed in fig .",
    "[ f : mam:1](b ) and consequently the model parameters of eqs .   and   available in table  [ t : shift ] .",
    "note again the same temperature shift as obtained already for lower scales .",
    "this is evident in fig .",
    "[ f : mam:1](b ) showing only vertical shift of individual master curves attributed to an increasing stiffness when moving up individual scales .",
    "finally , fitting the inverse of the homogenized master curve to a particular chain of maxwell units then allows for estimating the macroscopic response of mam to a given load limiting the material symmetry to a macroscopic isotropy .",
    "the response of the homogenized asphalt mixture to the applied remote shear strain labeled as `` leonov macro '' appears in fig .",
    "[ f : mam:1](a ) . since derived from the solution of a unit cell problem , a relatively good agreement with these solutions has been expected .",
    "the difference is merely attributed to the specific approximation of the homogenized master curve via dirichlet series .",
    "it is fair to mention a considerable sensitivity of the predictions to a particular choice of pairs of parameters ( shear modulus and retardation time ) of the maxwell units . although promising , to fully accept the proposed uncoupled multiscale computational strategy will require further testing , both numerical and laboratory .",
    "this topic is still widely opened .",
    "although research interests on flexible pavements have been quite intense in the past two decades , the field is still very much in development and will certainly witness considerable activity in the coming decade particular in connection to hierarchical modeling and micromechanics . within this framework ,",
    "the present contribution provides theoretical tools for the formulation of macroscopic constitutive law reflecting the confluence of threads coming from experimental work , image analysis , statistical mechanics and traditional disciplines of micromechanics and the first order computational homogenization . here",
    ", the totally uncoupled multiscale modeling approach is favored to enable an inexpensive analysis of real world large scale structures .",
    "since much of the considered is primarily computational it would be audacious to brought this approach directly to points of application without additional experimental validation .",
    "large scale experiments of rut depth measurements due to moving wheel load are currently under way .",
    "the effect of microstructure anisotropy , influence of the first stress invariant or three - dimensional character of asphalt mixtures are just a few issues which need to be addressed , yielding flexible pavements a fertile field of future research .",
