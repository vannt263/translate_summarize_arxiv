    "bragg scattering in condensed matter is a powerful method for gaining information over the structural properties of crystalline solids .",
    "usually , one employs thermal neutron beams , whose thermal wavelength is of the order of the interparticle distance inside the crystal . while elastic scattering allows one to measure the reciprocal lattice primitive cell , inelastic scattering gives information about the phonon spectrum and anharmonicities  @xcite . in atomic systems ,",
    "bragg scattering has been applied for demonstrating long  range order in structures of cold ions in traps  @xcite and neutral atoms in optical lattices  @xcite .",
    "moreover it has proven to be a precise tool for the measurement of the elementary excitations of trapped bose - einstein condensate @xcite and strongly - correlated atoms in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the spectra of the scattered photons , moreover , provide information on the details of atom - photon interactions .",
    "studies on opto - mechanical systems , for instance , showed that the stokes and anti - stokes components of the scattered light may exhibit entanglement , which emerges from and is mediated by the interaction with the quantum vibrational modes of the scattering system  @xcite .",
    "such correlations are endorsed by quantum interference in the processes leading to photon scattering , which is mainly visible in the height of the spectral peaks as a function of the emission angle  @xcite , and can be an important resource for quantum networks  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we investigate the opto - mechanical properties of strongly - correlated atoms in optical lattices .",
    "these systems present peculiar features , when compared with solid - state crystals . in optical lattices the bulk periodicity is determined by the light potentials , and is hence of the order of half the laser wavelength .",
    "one remarkable property is that light both couples to the atomic transition and is diffracted by the crystalline structure which the atoms form  @xcite .",
    "this property implies , for instance , that the system may exhibit peculiar self - organization , being the atoms a diffracting medium for the light which traps them  @xcite .    in the dispersive regime ,",
    "when the optical lattice can be considered a conservative potential , various states of ultracold matter can be realized  @xcite , thereby mimicking solid state models  @xcite , a prominent example of which is the quantum phase transition between a mott - insulator and a superfluid state  @xcite .",
    "bragg spectroscopy provides an important tool for characterizing the quantum state of the atomic gas  @xcite .",
    "the experimental procedure typically uses two laser beams , whose wave vector difference @xmath0 gives , by means of the mechanical effects induced by photon recoil , a momentum and energy transfer @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding atomic response is detected by a time - of - flight measurement , consisting in releasing the trap and measuring the momentum distribution by atom detection  @xcite .",
    "an alternative procedure makes use of parametric amplification followed by time - of - flight measurement , thereby revealing the energy transfer and the spectrum  @xcite .",
    "these procedures may allow one to measure the structure form factor  @xcite and characterize the state of the gas .",
    "most recently , ultracold atoms were loaded inside of optical resonators , and first measurements of the spectrum of transmission of the light at the cavity output showed novel features , which can be brought back to the collective and coherent interaction of the atoms with the light  @xcite .",
    "several theoretical works pointed out that the observation of the photon scattered by ultracold atoms may provide complementary information on the quantum state of the atoms  @xcite , which could be non - destructive in some setups  @xcite .    light scattering by atoms trapped in a one - dimensional optical lattice with lattice constant @xmath3 .",

    "the spectrum of the scattered light is measured at a detector as a function of the angle of emission . in experiments ,",
    "one can also use a second laser beam , into which the photon is emitted with high probability , hence implementing stimulated bragg scattering  @xcite . ]",
    "we also remark that theoretical studies on fermionic systems in an optical lattice showed that intensity fluctuations of the scattered light may allow one to determine the temperature of the atomic cloud  @xcite . optical detection , and in particular the intensity of the bragg peaks ,",
    "were proposed as a mean for revealing fractional particle numbers of fermi gases confined by optical lattices  @xcite . in this paper , we study light scattering by ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice , in the setup sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "we use a full quantum description of the photonic and atomic fields , for a range of optical lattice depths which covers the superfluid to mott - insulator transition . by starting from the general hamiltonian",
    ", we carry out the tight - binding and single - band approximations , and we determine the scattering cross section of photons in the linear response regime . extending previous works  @xcite , we systematically take into account the finite tunneling rate in evaluating the scattering cross section for parameters sweeping along the phase transition mott - insulator to superfluid state .",
    "our study focusses on a small lattice of 7 sites , and solves numerically the bose - hubbard model for this system . in order to get insight into the numerical results",
    ", we also develop an analytical theory , which extends the theory presented in  @xcite by including the hopping induced by photon recoil .",
