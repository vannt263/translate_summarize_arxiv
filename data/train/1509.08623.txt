    "since @xmath4 is increasing in the average , it is natural to expect that @xmath12 is a rather probable event .",
    "more precisely it was asked by t.  w. cusick ( personal communication , 2012 ) whether the asymptotic densities @xmath13 satisfy , for all integers @xmath14 , @xmath15 here and in what follows , @xmath16 denotes the asymptotic density of a set @xmath17 .",

    "concerning his question , cusick `` acquired more confidence in it over time '' and consequently `` would now refer to the question as a conjecture '' ( personal communication , september  23 , 2015 ) .",
    "although it is quite easy to compute @xmath1 for every fixed @xmath0 ( see section  [ sec : auxiliary ] ) , the full statement could not be tackled so far .",
    "our numerical experiments show that   holds at least for all @xmath18 , which is a quite good support for cusick s conjecture .",
    "moreover , by the same method we computed @xmath19 for @xmath18 , and the result of this computation suggests that @xmath20 should hold for all @xmath0 , which increases the significance of the original question .",
    "the main result of this paper is the following asymptotic statement , which gives a positive answer to cusick s conjecture for almost all integers but also shows that the bound @xmath21 is tight .",

    "@xmath22 ) concentrate well above ( resp .",

    "the most direct approach would have been to use the algorithmic theory of pemantle and wilson  @xcite , by which , in principle , it is possible to derive the expansion automatically .",
    "however , the rational function @xmath286 turns out to be a case where the ( automatic ) machinery runs into a limit case which has to be treated separately ; the _ generic form _ of the asymptotic expansion usually fails here .",
    "instead , we have obtained the terms of the expansion by an experimental approach .",
    "it is well - known  @xcite that the diagonal of a rational function in several variables is d - finite , i.e. , the coefficients @xmath287\\ , f(x , y , z)$ ] satisfy a certain linear recurrence equation with polynomial coefficients , and their generating function @xmath288\\ , f(x , y , z)\\bigr)t^n\\ ] ] must satisfy a linear differential equation with polynomial coefficients .",
    "it is also well - known that these equations can be constructed by computer algebra using the technique of creative telescoping  @xcite .",
    "we will see later in section  [ sec:5.2 ] in the case of a bivariate rational function how this works .    in the present case , where we have three variables , the computation of a certified differential equation for the diagonal series is also feasible , but quite costly .",

    "doing so , we detected a linear recurrence of order  24 with polynomial coefficients of order  190 and a linear differential equation of order  11 with polynomial coefficients of degree  220 for the diagonal series .",
    "the equations are somewhat too lengthy to be reproduced here .",

    "is a set of truncated formal series solutions of the given recurrence .",
    "although these series are only formal solutions by construction , experience shows that they often can be viewed as asymptotic expansions of actual sequence solutions .",
    "we therefore had reasons to hope that the asymptotic behaviour of the diagonal sequence @xmath287\\ , f(x , y , z)$ ] could be written as some linear combination of the series we found .",
    "of course , only those solutions for which @xmath318 is maximal can contribute to the asymptotic behaviour . in many other cases , there is just one such maximal solution , and so to get the asymptotic behaviour of a sequence @xmath319 under consideration , it only remains to find a constant @xmath313 such that @xmath320 . in the present case ,",
