    "`` light - shining - through - wall '' ( lsw ) experiments have become a valuable tool in the search for numerous theoretically well - motivated ` weakly interacting slim particles ' ( wisps ) that could exist beyond the standard model of particle physics . here , the shorthand ` wisp ' subsumes hypothetical light particles at the ( sub-)@xmath2 scale which exhibit a weak effective coupling to the electromagnetic field and are thus sensitive to optical searches @xcite .",
    "such particles generically arise in a number of extensions of the standard model and under certain conditions also constitute a viable dark matter candidate @xcite .",
    "most prominently , lsw experiments provide for the best _ direct _ laboratory bounds on axions , axion - like particles ( alps ) @xcite and massive hidden - sector photons ( also referred to as paraphotons ) @xcite , as well as for _ indirect _ limits on massless hidden - sector photons and fractionally charged or ` minicharged ' particles @xcite .",
    "see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein for a recent overview .    in classic lsw scenarios",
    "the barrier is ` tunneled ' by _ real _ , i.e. , on - shell wisps .",
    "their paradigm is the lsw scenario with alps @xcite .",
    "light - shining - through - walls becomes possible if the probe photons are converted into alps in front of the wall and are reconverted into photons behind the wall . in",
    "typical laboratory searches the conversion processes are induced by strong dipole magnets , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "we depict this scenario in fig .",
    "[ fig : lsw_wisp ] .        besides lsw experiments",
    ", polarimetric measurements @xcite carried out in various setups @xcite constitute an important means in the general search for wisps .",
    "recent suggestions involve , e.g. , advanced interferometric setups @xcite , tests of coulomb s law @xcite or experiments utilizing high - intensity lasers @xcite .",
    "in addition , also lsw experiments using astrophysical sources , particularly the sun , have been carried out with remarkable success as , e.g. , in the cast experiment @xcite , see also @xcite . such lsw ` helioscopes ' as well as arguments involving stellar energy loss observations ,",
    "lead to extremely strong constraints @xcite .",
    "the drawback is that most of these constraints are somewhat model dependent , as their derivation involves extrapolations to a different momentum - transfer regime @xcite .",
    "further _ indirect _ bounds on various hypothetical particles can be derived from cosmology by studying possible distorsions of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "the model - independent limits of these bounds for minicharged particles are currently somewhat stronger than the direct laboratory bounds .",
    "the high sensitivity of laboratory lsw experiments stems from the large number of laser photons available for the conversion process in front of the wall , facing the possibility of even single photon detection on its rear side .",
    "currently , the best experimental bounds are due to the first stage of the ` any - light particle search ' alps - i @xcite at desy .",
    "proposals to enhance the sensitivity of this experiment even further , involve an enlarged magnetic length @xcite and the installation of a second cavity on the regeneration side , i.e. , utilizing so - called ` resonant - regeneration ' @xcite .",
    "higher energy photons @xcite are used in other contexts .",
    "noteworthy , the latter concept could recently be verified experimentally even for regeneration in the sub - quantum regime @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we aim at investigating a different lsw scenario , namely the ` tunneling ' of a barrier through in general _ virtual _ particle - antiparticle intermediate states .",
    "our main focus is on the process in the presence of an external magnetic field , cf .",
    "[ fig : t3k_full ] .",
    "a compact version of our results has been given in @xcite .",
    "as the tunneling process with the virtual particle - antiparticle pair complements both quantum mechanical tunneling and the tunneling of real particles as depicted in fig .  [ fig : lsw_wisp ] , it has been baptized ` tunneling of the 3rd kind ' @xcite .",
    "although such a process is in principle also possible with neutrinos , this standard model background is highly suppressed due to the fermi scale .",
    "although the photon - to - photon transition amplitude grows logarithmically with decreasing mass of the minicharged particles in the absence of an external field , zero - field ` tunneling of the 3rd kind ' can not improve existing bounds of the minicharged particles parameter space @xcite .",
    "by contrast , we show in this work that current laboratory bounds on minicharged fermions in the sub - mev regime can be significantly enhanced by an external magnetic field .",
    "most importantly , they can even outmatch the best current model - independent cosmological bounds below minicharged fermion masses of @xmath1 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "[ sec : setting ] the general formalism describing the lsw scenario depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : t3k_full ] is outlined and the photon - to - photon transition probability is derived .",
    "[ sec : poltensor ] focuses on the explicit determination of the transition probability .",
    "this in particular requires an adequate analytical treatment of the photon polarization tensor .",
    "appropriate limiting cases which ultimately allow for a numerical evaluation of the transition probability are worked out . in addition",
    ", analytic asymptotics in the most relevant limits are derived .",
    "specializing to a specific , experimentally feasible setup , in sect .",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "let us briefly review the basic setting as introduced in  @xcite and extend it to account for an external magnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "we adopt the metric convention @xmath4 of @xcite , such that the momentum four - vector squared reads @xmath5 .",

    ", the wall does not affect the propagation of minicharged particles .",
    "hence , translational invariance is maintained for the minicharged particles and thus for the polarization tensor at one - loop order .",
    "as long as the magnetic field is homogeneous in the relevant spacetime region , this implies @xmath12 .    upon a variation of eq .   and",
    "a transformation to momentum space , the following equation of motion is obtained @xmath13 the photon - to - photon transition probability depends on the polarization mode of the photons .",
    "contrary to the zero - field situation , there are three independent polarization modes in the presence of an external field , which we label by an index @xmath14 .",
    "as the vacuum speed of light in external fields deviates from its zero - field value @xcite , and the vacuum exhibits medium - like properties , the occurrence of three ( instead of two in the absence of an external field ) independent polarization modes is not surprising .",
    "for instance , the corresponding polarization effects induced by minicharged particles have been studied in @xcite .",
    "further diffractive effects in inhomogeneous fields as also considered in quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) @xcite are conceivable and certainly worthwhile to be studied .",
    "let us now briefly introduce the explicit structure of the photon polarization tensor in the presence of an external field .",
    "here we limit ourselves to the special case of a purely magnetic field @xcite .",
    "this naturally suggests a decomposition of the photon four - momentum @xmath15 in components parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field vector @xmath16 .",
    "the angle @xmath17 is denoted by @xmath18 . without loss of generality @xmath16 is assumed to point in @xmath19 direction , and the following decomposition is adopted , @xmath20 in the same manner , tensors can be decomposed , e.g. , @xmath21 .",
    "it is then convenient to introduce the following projection operators onto photon polarization modes , @xmath22 defining a third projector as follows , @xmath23 the three projectors @xmath24 obviously span the transverse subspace . whereas two of these polarization modes can be continuously related to the photon polarization modes in the absence of an external magnetic field ,",
    "the third mode manifests itself in the presence of the external field only .",
    "note that @xmath25 and @xmath26 have an intuitive interpretation , provided that @xmath27 .",
    "namely , they project onto photon modes polarized parallel and perpendicular to the plane spanned by the two vectors , @xmath28 and @xmath16 . for @xmath27",
    "these are the polarization modes , that can be continuously related to those in the zero - field limit .",
    "remarkably , for the special alignment of @xmath29 , the situation is different . here , the modes @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be continuously related to the two zero - field polarization modes .    with the help of eqs .",
    "( [ pparperp ] ) and ( [ p0 ] ) , the photon polarization tensor in a purely magnetic field can be decomposed as follows @xcite , @xmath32 where the scalar functions @xmath33 are the components of the polarization tensor in the respective subspaces .",
    "thus , dropping lorentz indices , the equation of motion for photons in mode @xmath34 , @xmath35 , resulting from eq",
    ".   reads @xmath36    as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : schief ] , we assume the probe photons to propagate in @xmath37 direction , normal to the light blocking barrier , i.e. , @xmath38 .",
    "the barrier extends from @xmath39 to @xmath40 along @xmath37 , and has infinite extent orthogonal to @xmath37 .",
    "direction normal to the wall .",
    "we look for regenerated photons behind the wall propagating along the line of propagation of the incident photons .",
    "the angle between @xmath41 and @xmath42 is denoted by @xmath18.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    introducing partial fourier transforms of the photon field and the polarization tensor , @xmath43 where @xmath44 , the equation of motion becomes @xmath45 where we have defined the fluctuation - induced current @xmath46 . following  @xcite , we choose reflecting boundary conditions on the front side of the barrier , @xmath39 , for the incident photons .",
    "note that the calculation could easily be generalized to other boundary conditions .",
    "accordingly , the induced current within and beyond the barrier reads @xmath47 where @xmath48 denotes the amplitude of the incident photons .",
    "moreover , the photon source is assumed to be sufficiently far away , such that the lower integration limit in eq .",
    "can be formally sent to @xmath49 ( cf .",
    "comment at the end of this section ) .    to obtain the photon - to - photon transition probability , the outgoing photon wave on the rear side of the barrier has to be determined . for detector positions",
    "asymptotically far beyond the barrier at @xmath50 , we find @xmath51 where we formally sent the upper integration limit to @xmath52 , employed the free outgoing green s function for the operator @xmath53 and restricted ourselves to the right - moving , i.e. , transmitted components of the outgoing photon field .",
    "this corresponds to absorbing boundary conditions on the rear side of the wall at @xmath40 .",
    "thus , combining eq .   and",
    "eq .  , the photon - to - photon transition probability can finally be written as @xmath54 where we have dropped any explicit reference to the magnetic field @xmath55 for clarity .",
    "as @xmath56 receives its main contributions from relative distances @xmath57 of the order of the compton wavelength @xmath58 of the minicharged particles , and falls off rapidly for @xmath59 , it is justified to formally extend the integration ranges to @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "with respect to an actual experimental realization this implies that the magnetic field has to be sufficiently homogeneous only within a sphere of diameter @xmath61 centered at the intersection of the optical axis with the wall .",
    "in the subsequent section we explicitly evaluate eq .  .",
    "our focus is on minicharged dirac fermions .",

    "here we are interested in the special case of a purely magnetic field @xcite only . several well - established approximations to the polarization tensor in a purely magnetic field",
    "have been worked out @xcite . however , most approximations considered so far put special attention to on - the - light - cone dynamics . besides , they are in general limited to physical problems that can be treated directly in momentum space , as their derivation involves constraints to a certain momentum regime . in contrast",

    "the photon polarization tensor of standard quantum electrodynamics is adapted to minicharged particles by substituting the electron - positron loop for a minicharged particle - antiparticle loop .",
    "formally , this amounts to a change of the coupling @xmath62 , with @xmath63 referring to a dimensionless fractional coupling , and an identification of @xmath64 with the mass of the minicharged particles .",
    "noteworthy , higher loop corrections to the photon polarization tensor at one - loop accuracy adapted to minicharged particles are therewith suppressed by at least an additional factor of @xmath65 .",

    "<S> we show that magnetic fields have the potential to significantly enhance a recently proposed light - shining - through - walls scenario in quantum - field theories with photons coupling to minicharged particles . suggesting a dedicated laboratory experiment , we demonstrate that this particular tunneling scenario could provide access to a parameter regime competitive with the currently best direct laboratory limits on minicharged fermions below the @xmath0 regime . with present day technology , </S>",
    "<S> such an experiment has the potential to even overcome the best model - independent cosmological bounds on minicharged fermions with masses below @xmath1 . </S>"
