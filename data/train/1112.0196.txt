    "vcsel emitting in the mid - infrared ( @xmath2  ) are of high interest for their use as stable and tunable sources for spectroscopic measurements . in this wavelength range",
    ", algainassb appears as the best material system for mid - infrared vcsel fabrication .",
    "however the wavelength emission of devices made from this material system is currently limited close to  @xmath1   essentially due to the very thick ( @xmath3  ) distributed bragg mirror ( dbr ) necessary to achieve 99.5  % reflectivity  @xcite which impairs the vcsel properties .",
    "sub - wavelength grating mirrors ( sgm ) with a low index sublayer  @xcite can advantageously replace this dbr by exhibiting high reflectivity with a low thickness .",
    "sgm have already been successfully used as vcsel top mirror  @xcite providing a 100  nm large stopband with a 99.9  % reflectivity near 850  nm .",
    "a tolerance study has also been performed on this type of mirror which is made of an algaas grating above an air gap as low index sublayer  @xcite .",
    "the most critical parameter from a fabrication point of view is the etching of the 100  nm wide grooves .",
    "however , it has been shown that the grating parameters are very tolerant with @xmath4  30  % on this etch length and @xmath4  10  % on the grating period .",
    "these high tolerance values , compared to the 1  % tolerance of dbr , is another very good advantage for vcsel fabrication  @xcite .",
    "moreover , such mirrors present a polarization sensitivity which should improve the quality of the laser emitted beam . in a previous work , sio@xmath0/si - based mid - infrared sub - wavelength grating mirrors ( sgm )",
    "have been modelled and optimized for vcsel application  @xcite .",
    "these first simulations have shown that such sgm mirrors , centered at  @xmath5  , can present high enough optical properties for successful vcsel integration if an adequate design is carefully chosen .    in a first part of this work",
    ", a study of the impact of the technological constraints on the centered mirror performances is presented through the comparison of two different designs .",
    "then , the robustness with respect to fabrication errors is evaluated thanks to a tolerance computation of the different geometrical parameters of the design .",
    "with optical indexes of n@xmath6  3.48 , n@xmath7  1.47 and n@xmath8  3.9,width=226 ]    the mirror structure is composed by a sub - wavelength grating mirror on top of a silica sublayer as shown on figure  [ figure1 ] . a quarter - wavelength sio@xmath0/si pair inserted below the grating",
    "is used to achieve the vcsel mirror reflectivity necessary for laser operation  @xcite .",
    "then , the optical properties for a tm - polarized vcsel have been defined . to ensure the polarization selectivity ,",
    "the tm reflectivity was chosen to have a minimum value of 99.9  % together with the widest possible bandwidth while the te one was kept below 90  % .",
    "these requirements allow to define a quality factor @xmath9 as follow :    @xmath10    the quality factor @xmath9 mainly represents the normalized bandwidth of the mirror .",
    "the bandwidth @xmath11 normalized by @xmath12 is defined by the range of wavelengths @xmath13 around @xmath12 where the tm reflectivity @xmath14 is higher than 99.9  % and the te reflectivity @xmath15 is lower than 90  % .",
    "the centering of the mirror is then taken into account by performing a gaussian weighted average of the @xmath14 values on the n points of the bandwidth @xmath16 .",
    "a global optimization algorithm  @xcite was then used to increase the sgm performances .",
    "the quality factor @xmath9 , specifically defined for this application , is thus automatically maximized by adjusting the different sgm characteristic dimensions .",
    "however , such a problem presents many local maxima and the use of a global algorithm is mandatory . for each evaluation of the quality factor @xmath9 ,",
    "reflectivity spectra were numerically computed by rigorous coupled - wave analysis ( rcwa )  @xcite with constant optical index values of n@xmath6  3.48 , n@xmath7  1.47 and n@xmath8  3.9 . moreover",
    ", the use of an optimization algorithm allows the designer to define boundaries for the mirror geometrical dimensions .",
    "thus , the technological constraints were also taken into account by the way of depth and length limitations .",
    "these constraints limit the filled length @xmath17 , the empty length @xmath18 of the grating and its aspect ratio @xmath19 , defined as the grating thickness @xmath20 to the etched length @xmath18 ratio ( figure  [ figure1 ] ) .",
    "these limitations can be easily adjusted by the manufacturers according to the etching process used and the machine specifications .",
    "sgm structures require a vertical etching profile with squared pattern to reach the 99.9  % high reflectivity . in order to obtain an experimental square grating profile close to the theoretical one presented on figure  [ figure1 ] ,",
    "the first optimization was done by keeping the filled length @xmath17 and etched length @xmath18 of the grating larger than 500  nm and the aspect ratio @xmath19 smaller than 1.1 as constraints values .",
    "this means that the optimization retains only the designs with wide grooves since a shallow pattern is easier to etch than a deep one .",
    "compared to data already published in the literature , these constraints are relatively severe for the optimization algorithm since the best si / sio@xmath0 sgms with bandwidths as large as 350  nm were defined with narrower patterns of less than 260  nm and a large @xmath19 of more than 2.6  @xcite . even if a simple sgm structure could exhibit 99.9  % reflectivity under these technological constraints ,",
    "the quarter wavelength layers have been added to increase the bandwidth of the mirror  @xcite .",

    "however , it appears that technological constraints dramatically impact on these properties since the normalized bandwidth obtained in this case is @xmath33  6.6  % while it can be 17  % without constraints  @xcite . for a better understanding and quantification of this impact",
    ", a new design was developed .",
    "for this new design , the optimization was performed under slightly more severe technological constraints which lowered the limitations of the optimization algorithm .",
    "the minimum lengths @xmath18 and @xmath17 were kept above 400  nm and the aspect ratio @xmath19 smaller than 1.25 .",
    "these constraints lead to a 721  nm thick grating with a filled length @xmath17 of 479  nm and an empty length @xmath18 of 591  nm .",
    "the sio@xmath0 sublayer has a thickness of 499  nm ( table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , due to these lower constraints , the reflector exhibits better performances with a @xmath31  270  nm bandwidth ( figure  [ figure2 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , with smaller steps for the grating and narrower and deeper grooves ( @xmath34  1.22 ) , this design requires a better control of the etching process .    to conclude this part , the quality of the mirror increases significantly with the reduction of the technological limitations where @xmath35 is a key factor .",
    "however , the grating pattern could be manufactured with a certain inaccuracy resulting in new design limitations .",
    "nevertheless , this new form of technological constraint , related to the reliability of the fabrication process , is less critical in the case of a robust design .",
    "the robustness of a design is evaluated by performing tolerance computations on the different dimensions of the structure .",
    "the tolerance of one parameter is defined by the variation range of this parameter for which the bandwidth of the mirror verifies the condition @xmath36  0  nm .",
    "this means that the design keeps @xmath37  99.9  % and @xmath38  90  % at @xmath12 .",
    "it is important to note that for the computation of one tolerance value , @xmath18 for instance , the quality of the mirror is measured by varying it while the other parameters ( @xmath17 , @xmath20 and @xmath28 ) are kept at their optimal values .    since the different geometrical dimensions of the grating are not decorrelated , if one parameter is inaccurately achieved during the fabrication process , for instance the grating thickness @xmath20 , the computed tolerances of the other parameters , in the example @xmath18 , @xmath17 and @xmath28 , are not valid any more .",
    "to simplify the problem in 2d , only two parameters @xmath18 and @xmath17 , which variation ranges are defined by @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively , will be considered at the following .    in the worst case ,",
    "if one parameter is at its extremum value , @xmath41 for instance , a small variation of the other parameter @xmath17 would also decrease the quality of the mirror .",
    "thus , the variation range of @xmath17 would tend to 0 when @xmath18 tends to its extremum value .    by making the hypothesis that the decrease of the variation range is linear , the four extrema @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 define the vertices of a quadrilateral in the ( @xmath18 , @xmath17 )  plan .",
    "the area within the quadrilateral represents the set of pairs ( @xmath18 , @xmath17 ) which define vcsel - quality mirrors .",
    "a similar approach can be made to define an hyper - polyhedron in dimension 4 with the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath17 , @xmath20 and @xmath28 .",
    "versus etched length @xmath18 for the first design .",
    "the point ( 675 , 629 ) at the center represents the optimum value found by the optimization .",
    "the quadrilateral ( dashed line ) defines , in a linear approximation , the area of ( @xmath18 , @xmath17 ) pairs which correspond to vcsel - quality designs .",
    "the computations of the period @xmath46 and the fill factor @xmath47 define 4 points which extend the quadrilateral to a polyhedron ( grey area ) .",
    "the worst case hypothesis is thus confirmed by a larger area of tolerance.,width=377 ]     versus the silica thickness @xmath28 .",
    "the arrow shows the optimum design ( @xmath48  17 nm ) .",
    "the silica thickness @xmath28 can be as large as 100  nm without decreasing excessively the quality of the mirror by keeping a 115  nm large bandwitdh.,width=283 ]    the computation of the tolerances of the first design shows very large variation range of 288  nm for @xmath18 , 146  nm for @xmath17 and 66  nm for @xmath20 ( table  [ table1 ] ) which renders the grating very robust with respect to the fabrication imperfections .",
    "moreover , as shown in figure  [ figure3 ] which represents the variation range of @xmath17 versus @xmath18 , the optimal value found by the optimization algorithm is well centered within the quadrilateral delimited by the extrema ( 675 , 685 ) , ( 841 , 629 ) , ( 675 , 539 ) , ( 553 , 629 ) ( dashed lines ) . the computation of the variation range of the grating period @xmath23 and the fill factor @xmath49 results in ( @xmath18 , @xmath17 ) pairs which are not included within the quadrilateral .",
    "thus , the tolerance area in the ( @xmath18 , @xmath17 ) plan is extended to a polygon , the grey area in figure  [ figure3 ] , which is larger than the region defined by dashed line , validating the worst case hypothesis made previously .",
    "the grating thickness is the most sensitive parameter for this design but thanks to the presence of the sio@xmath0 sublayer , a selective etching method can be used which would increase the control of the etched depth .",
    "the silica sublayer of 17  nm exhibits the largest tolerance and can vary from 0  nm up to 502  nm .",
    "as discussed in  @xcite , the suppression of this layer can result in a more performant design .",
    "this is perfectly shown on figure  [ figure4 ] where the normalized bandwidth @xmath30 is plotted versus the silica sublayer thickness @xmath28 .",
    "this figure indicates that the thinner is @xmath28 , the larger the bandwidth becomes .",
    "thus the interest of this sublayer is mainly to provide the possibility of using a selective etching method and must be very thin .     versus the silica thickness @xmath28 for the second design .",
    "the arrow shows the optimum design ( @xmath48  499  nm ) .",
    "the hatchings correspond to the silica thickness range where the te polarization condition is not respected . for lower thicknesses ( @xmath50  100  nm ) , better",
    "gratings can be found but they exhibit smaller tolerance values as low as 12  nm for the filled length @xmath17.,width=283 ]     versus etched length @xmath18 for the second design .",
    "the optimum design ( 591 , 479 ) is very closed to the boundary of the tolerance area defined by the polyhedron ( grey area ) .",
    "this design requires a better etching precision with less than 5  nm of error allowed.,width=283 ]    for the second design , computations indicate smaller variation range of 76  nm for @xmath18 , 38  nm for @xmath17 and 42  nm for @xmath20 ( table  [ table2 ] ) which impose to have a better control of the fabrication process .",
    "moreover , the optimum value of @xmath28 is more sensitive with a variation range of only 48  nm .",
    "this length is limited by the apparition of high te reflectivity of more than 90  % within the bandwidth for thicknesses @xmath50  495  nm ( figure  [ figure5 ] ) which is forbidden by our hypothesis .    besides these smaller tolerance values , the optimum design found",
    "is not centered within the tolerance area .",
    "as shown in figure  [ figure6 ] , the optimum point is very close to the boundary of the area in the ( @xmath18 , @xmath17 ) plan which imposes even smaller precision of less than 4  nm for the fabrication process .",
    "a solution to avoid this requirement is to choose another point in the grey area of the figure  [ figure6 ] which would be more centered but would result in a less performant mirror .",
    "it is also interesting to note that a smaller value of @xmath28 of 18  nm lead to a better mirror with a bandwidth as large as 300  nm ( figure  [ figure5 ] ) . this design has not been found by our optimization algorithm since it has smaller tolerance values as low as 12  nm for @xmath17 .",
    "such a design represents a narrow maximum for the quality function @xmath9 and thanks to the use of probability in the optimization algorithm , designs with large tolerance values are statistically promoted .",
    "in this work , two different sgm designs based on si / sio@xmath0 materials and centered at are described . these mirrors with total thicknesses lower than are well adapted for a vcsel integration .",
    "the design of the sgm mirror can easily be adapted to the technological constraints of the manufacturers by adjusting the limitations defined for the automated optimization process .",
    "indeed , the comparison between different technological constraints shows that a better accuracy of the etching process results in an increase of the quality of the mirror with a 118  nm larger bandwidth .",
    "however , this quality increase is also linked to a less robust mirror with respect to fabrication imperfections on the different dimensions .",
    "the choice of the design in regard to the manufacturing process can be made by taking into account not only the limitations on the pattern resolution but also the precision required to keep a efficient mirror .",
    "this work can also be adapted to a large range of materials , such as semi - conductors , structures and wavelengths to meet the optical requirements of numerous applications .",
