    "this result was announced the first time by poincar in 1883 @xcite and published in 1884 @xcite with reference to a proof using homotopy invariance of the index .",
    "the result obtained by poincar has come to be known as the theorem of miranda , who in 1940 showed that it is equivalent to the brouwer fixed point @xcite . for different proofs of the poincar - miranda theorem in the @xmath12-dimensional case ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite . in the two - dimensional case",
    "the poincar - miranda theorem can be enunciated in the following way .",

    "then there exist @xmath18 such that @xmath19 .",
    "it is clear that the above theorem is still true assuming a non - symmetric square @xmath20 .",
    "although this paper @xmath21 will denote a continuous mapping of a square @xmath22 \\times [ -a_2,a_2]\\subset \\mathbb{r}^2 $ ] into @xmath23 , the aim of this paper is to develop a bisection method for solving non - linear system of two - dimensional equations @xmath24 using the above poincar - miranda theorem .",
    "we denote by @xmath25 the euclidean norm in @xmath23 and we accept @xmath26 as a root with tolerance level @xmath27 if @xmath28 .",
    "the idea of the algorithm is similar as in the classical one dimensional algorithm , we perform refinement of the domain region in order to preserve the poincar - miranda sign conditions . one of the advantages of this method reside in the fact that it does not require derivatives of @xmath21 , nor the approximation of such derivatives ; only the computed values of @xmath21 are required .",

    "in this work we have developed an original two - dimensional root - finding bisection method using a generalization of bolzano theorem . since we can not always guarantee that a quadrisection will verify the poincar - miranda condition we can not always ensure the converge of the method , however for several systems it has very good performance in the root s approximation .",
    "moreover , we have proved that the method converges to a root for systems that allow infinite quadrisections .",
    "the accuracy of the method depends of the number of quadrisections allowed by the initial guess , so it plays a key role . on other side the main difference of this method respect to the classical newton and optimization algorithms reside in the fact that it does not require derivatives of @xmath21 avoiding the problem of ill - conditioned jacobian matrix .",
