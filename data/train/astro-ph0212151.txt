    "patterson & richman ( 1991 ) initially suggested the term ` permanent superhump ' for the subclass of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) having quasi - periodicities slightly different from their binary orbital periods . unlike su  uma systems ( see warner 1995 for a review of su  uma systems and cvs in general ) , which show this behaviour only during superoutbursts , permanent superhump systems show the phenomenon during their normal brightness state .",
    "however , their amplitudes are highly variable and are sometimes below the detection limits , so the term ` permanent superhump ' is somewhat misleading .",
    "whitehurst & king ( 1991 ) suggested that superhumps occur when the accretion disc extends beyond the 3:1 resonance radius . according to osaki ( 1996 ) ,",
    "permanent superhumpers differ from other subclasses of non - magnetic cvs in having relatively short orbital periods and high mass - transfer rates , resulting in accretion discs that are thermally stable but tidally unstable .",
    "retter & naylor ( 2000 ) provided observational support for this idea .",
    "the ` positive superhump ' , a periodicity that is a few per cent larger than the orbital period , is explained as the beat period between the binary motion and the precession of an eccentric accretion disc in the apsidal plane .",
    "periods slightly shorter than the orbital periods have also been seen in several systems .",
    "they are known as ` negative superhumps ' , and may be generated by the nodal precession of the accretion disc ( patterson et al .",
    "1993 ; patterson 1999 ) . however , there are some theoretical difficulties with this idea ( murray & armitage 1998 ; wood , montgomery & simpson 2000 ; murray et al .",
    "superhumps were also associated with the formation of a spiral structure in the accretion disc ( steeghs , harlaftis & horne 1997 ; baba et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "observations of positive superhumps have shown a roughly linear relationship between the period excess , expressed as a fraction of the binary period , and the binary period itself ( stolz & schoembs 1984 ) .",
    "negative superhumps seem to obey a similar rule ( patterson 1999 ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     previous studies around an outburst in 1991 december showed that the phase of the 5.2-h period ( the negative superhump ) was changed by about 0.4 ( hellier & buckley 1993 ) .",
    "our 2001 data were similarly checked .",
    "first , the ephemeris fitted to the two parts of the data ( before and after outburst ) suggested a shift of @xmath01.4 h ( 0.27 cycles ) . to confirm this result , minima of the negative superhump",
    "were calculated from the data after the subtraction of the other periods ( 4 d and 5.5 h from both sets , and 6.3 h only from the latter data ) . the o@xmath1c diagram ( fig .",
    "7 ) clearly shows a shift of @xmath01.2 h or 0.24 cycles .",
    "the data are consistent with no shift in the phase of the orbital and beat periods .",
    "note that the errors on the 4-d period and its phase are large as less than two cycles of this frequency were observed in each set .",
    "= 3.0 in      according to theory , superhumps can only appear in binaries with tidally unstable accretion discs .",
    "simulations show that the tidal instability can only occur if the disc radius exceeds a certain value , the 3:1 resonance radius .",
    "this implies that eccentric discs ( which generate the superhumps ) can be present only in cvs with small mass ratios",
    " @xmath2=@xmath3@xmath40.33 ( whitehurst 1988 ; whitehurst & king 1991 ; murray 2000 ) .",
    "hellier ( 1993 ) concluded , however , that the mass ratio in tv  col is @xmath2=0.62 - 0.93 from a spectroscopic analysis of the system , but this depended on an interpretation of the radial velocity variation of the emission lines that may not be correct .",
    "we can estimate the mass ratio in tv  col by a different method .",
    "the relation between the orbital period and the superhump period excess ( fig .",
    "6 ) suggests that there is a connection between the latter and some physical quantity .",
    "indeed , this relation was initially explained by osaki ( 1985 ) , who investigated the motion of free particles in the binary potential .",
    "he considered the axisymmetric part of the tidal perturbation potential of the secondary star and derived an expression for the precession rate of the eccentric disc based on a nonresonant free particle orbit at the disc edge in the first order .",
    "his formula has been commonly used to obtain the binary mass ratio from the superhump period excess ( e.g. retter , leibowitz & ofek 1997 ; patterson 1998 ) . the superhump period in tv",
    "col is @xmath5 per cent larger than the orbital period . using equation ( 15 ) of osaki ( 1996 )",
    ", we find : @xmath6  well above the 0.33 limit suggested by the hydrodynamic simulations , and consistent with the values estimated by hellier ( 1993 ) presented above .    the mass ratio in tv  col might thus be inconsistent with the models . in the following ,",
    "we discuss a few possible solutions for this dilemma and suggest how the observations of tv  col can be reconciled with the theory .      tv  col has a binary period of 5.5 h. according to the relation between the orbital period and the secondary mass in cvs ( smith & dhillon 1998 ) , the companion mass is @xmath7 .",
    "if the mass of the primary white dwarf in tv  col is @xmath8 ( ramsay 2000 ) , the mass ratio is around 0.6  still above the theoretical limit .",
    "tv  col can have a mass ratio below the critical value only for the secondary mass at the bottom of the above range and for a very massive white dwarf near the chandrasekhar mass ( 1.44@xmath9 ) . the mass ratio is then 0.32 .",
    "however , for a cv with the limiting theoretical mass ratio of 0.33 , a superhump period excess of only about 7 per cent is expected according to osaki s equation discussed in the previous section and this is inconsistent with the observational value of tv  col .",
    "this fact might indicate that osaki s formula can not be applied to tv  col .    the equation developed by osaki is based on a dynamical calculation of non - resonant particles .",
    "furthermore , it does not assume that the disc radius exceeds the 3:1 resonance radius .",
    "more sophisticated models have been introduced since .",
    "murray ( 2000 ) compared the mass ratios reliably measured for three eclipsing su  uma systems with estimates using the superhump excess in osaki s equation and found some inconsistency .",
    "he argued that the use of a gaseous disc ( rather than isolated test particles ) modifies the equations .",
    "the eccentricity is excited at the 3:1 resonance and then propagates inwards through the disc . according to his ideas , pressure forces are an important factor in the calculations , yielding mass ratios lower than the previous estimates .",
    "murray also argued that , for systems with mass ratios exceeding 0.25 , the dynamical equations can not be applied . from his simulations ( see his fig .",
    "2 ) , and using the observed superhump period excess of tv  col , a mass ratio of about 0.3 can be deduced .",
    "for a white dwarf of @xmath10 , this implies an undermassive secondary with @xmath11 , which would indicate an evolved star close or near the end of hydrogen burning ( see discussions in augusteijn et al .",
    "1996 ; beuermann et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "montgomery ( 2001 ) and montgomery et al .",
    "( in preparation ) developed analytic expressions for both types of superhumps .",
    "montgomery et al.argued that in binaries having superhumps , the ratio between the negative superhump deficit and the positive superhump excess ( @xmath12 ) should be used to estimate the mass ratio , rather than just one of these parameters .",
    "using their equation 9 and the observed @xmath13 parameter in tv  col ( @xmath14 ) , we can estimate a mass ratio within the range 0.31 - 0.56 .",
    "the lower value is consistent with murray s simulations .",
    "the mass ratio in tv  col may thus be about the critical limit of 0.33 .",
    "a criticism of this solution is that it suggests that it is only a coincidence that tv  col obeys the apparent relation between the superhump period excess and the orbital period ( fig .",
    "another solution to the problem might come from the suggestion that the strong magnetic field of the white dwarf pushes the particles in the outer accretion disc to larger orbits , allowing a disc size bigger than the normal tidal radius in a non - magnetic system ( this was confirmed by murray , personal communication ) . in this way",
    "tidally unstable discs in systems with mass ratios larger than 0.33 can be obtained .",
    "we are , however , not familiar with any model calculations that have been made for this case .",
    "1 .   we have found a 6.3-h period in the optical light curve of tv  col in the multi - longitude photometric campaign held in 2001 january .",
    "this detection confirms our findings from re - analysis of previously published photometric data .",
    "the periodicity is most naturally explained as a positive superhump .",
    "2 .   in the middle of the 2001 january run a short - lived minor outburst occurred .",
    "the new period is seen only in the data following outburst .",
    "the outburst also changed the phase of the negative superhump by about a quarter of a cycle , while its amplitude was slightly decreased .",
    "our findings support the classification of tv  col as a permanent superhump system .",
    "its superhump period is the longest known among cvs .",
    "tv  col thus offers a unique opportunity to test and reject some of the models , as it extends the superhump regime to periods far beyond the predicted values into a regime where the differences between models become significant .",
    "the mass ratio of tv  col might exceed the limit for superhump systems allowed by hydrodynamic simulations .",
    "the observational and physical link between positive and negative superhumps is thus strengthened by our result .",
    "we might speculate that all permanent superhump systems may have both types of superhumps .",
    "our finding significantly extends the upper limit of orbital periods in positive superhump systems ( from 3.7 h to 5.5 h ) .",
    "this range of periods is populated with dwarf novae and nova - like systems .",
    "therefore , we strongly urge observers to search for superhumps in nova - likes and dwarf novae with orbital periods above the period gap and up to at least 5.5 h , to check whether tv  col is unique .",
    "if tv  col has certain properties that can explain its extraordinarily long superhump period ( e.g. classification as an intermediate polar ) , then other long - period superhump systems should possess similar features .",
    "this paper uses observations made at the south african astronomical observatory ( saao ) .",
    "we thank p. woudt for his kind assistance as the support astronomer , j. patterson for utilizing the cba net and michele montgomery for sending us an early version of her paper prior to publication .",
    "two anonymous referees are acknowledged for valuable comments .",
    "we also thank d. odonoghue for sending some of the data to ch and for using his reduction software .",
