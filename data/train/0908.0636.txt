    "coupled harmonic chains with short and long range interactions are ubiquitous in science and engineering . their application to calculate the phononic heat capacity by einstein @xcite marks the birth of solid state physics . beyond physics ,",

    "harmonic systems have been revised using techniques developed in quantum information science to study correlation properties in the quantum regime and particularly at small temperatures @xcite .",
    "thermodynamics has been very successful in characterising `` standard '' phase transitions that occur at finite temperature when a macroscopic parameter , such as pressure , is changed @xcite .",
    "quantum phase transitions ( qpts ) appear at zero temperature @xcite and are due to the change of an external parameter , such as the trapping potential of an ion trap .",
    "these transitions are driven by quantum fluctuations and have been linked to entanglement for the case of finite dimensional systems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study a qpt in a continuous variable system : a system of trapped ions which we model as a harmonic lattice @xcite .",
    "the ions interact via a long - range coulomb repulsion and are trapped by two external potentials , see fig .",
    "[ fig : trap ] .",
    "they align in a linear configuration for big enough transversal trapping potential , @xmath0 however when @xmath0 is decreased the system undergoes a phase transition and the new equilibrium state forms a zig - zag configuration .",
    "this model is motivated by ion trap experiments @xcite , where such a qpt occurs @xcite .",
    "recent analytical studies of the transition using landau theory @xcite allowed to determine the system s classical behaviour at the transition point .",
    "moreover , the numerical treatment of the quantised system of a few ions promised the possibility of simulating linear and nonlinear klein - gordon fields on a lattice @xcite .",
    "however , a comprehensive analytical study of the quantised system has so far been lacking due to the complexity of the system .",
    "here we model the ion trap scenario as a lattice of harmonically coupled oscillators and present a first quantitative characterization of the entanglement inherent in both ground state configurations of the ions . for finite dimensional systems qpts of first ( second ) order",
    "are characterised by a discontinuity ( a discontinuity in or divergence of the first derivative ) of the negativity @xcite .",
    "we show that also in the here considered continuous variable system the structure of entanglement , measured by the negativity and the von neumann entropy , changes abruptly at the critical point and indicates the occurrence of a qpt , in a similar way as classical correlations indicate standard phase transitions .",
    "the first derivative of the negativity between two neighbouring ions has a finite discontinuity and the von neumann entropy of contiguous blocks of a single ion , two and three ions all show a divergence in the first derivative .",
    "the long - ranged nature of the coulomb interaction leads to an increase of the block entropy with increasing block size .",
    "this is in contrast to models with only nearest neighbour interaction where ` area laws ' apply @xcite and entanglement does not increase with block size , i.e. volume , as long as the surface of the block is constant .",
    "however , our results show that the increase in block entropy with the block size is quiet small due to the fast decline of the coulomb potential .",
    "the quantum fluctuations that cause the qpt are most dominant at zero temperature . however , as experiments are performed at small , but finite temperatures it is important to know how temperature affects these fluctuations @xcite . in the final part of our paper",
    "we discuss thermal states and find that the sharpness of the qpt , indicated by the entanglement , fades out with increasing temperature . another macroscopic consequence of quantum fluctuations is the lowering of the energy of the system @xcite . we compute up to which temperature the thermal state has a lower energy than any separable state .",
    "this temperature witness could be implemented in an ion trap experiment by measuring the average energy ( i.e. mean excitation ) .",

    "the transverse trapping potential @xmath0 is larger than the critical value and the ions arrange linearly .",
    "as displayed in @xmath14 , decreasing the transverse trapping potential below the critical value @xmath15 leads to a qpt causing the ions to move outwards and form a two - dimensional zig - zag structure .",
    ", scaledwidth=70.0% ]    to calculate the entanglement measures we approximate the coulomb potential to second order and expand about the equilibrium positions .",
    "the key step is then to diagonalise the hamiltonian into a set of uncoupled modes , the lattice vibrations , with which analytic expressions for the measures can be obtained .",
    "similar to the classical calculation @xcite , we use a simplified model with equidistant equilibrium position in @xmath5 direction , spaced by the lattice constant @xmath11 .",
    "such condition can be realised for the central ions of a long ion chain inside a linear paul trap @xcite or for ions confined in a ring of large radius @xcite .    for big trapping potential the sites",

    "the equation determining the deviation @xmath12 in @xmath9 direction is obtained by summing the linear terms over all sites and requiring it to vanish , @xmath19 where @xmath20 numbers the neighbours of each sites .",

    ", the @xmath5-entanglement is reduced due to the emerging @xmath40 coupling . because each site in ( b ) couples to several different neighbours , the entanglement between two distinct sites disappears .    in the lower plots ( c and d ) both entanglement measures for the @xmath9-entanglement grow with decreasing trapping potential @xmath0 in the linear configuration .",
    "the even numbered ions oscillate exactly out of phase with the odd numbered ions due to the repulsive coulomb potential .",
    "the smaller @xmath0 , the larger these quantum fluctuations around equilibrium position become . at the critical point",
    "the fluctuations become strong enough for causing the ions to move outward .",
    "the entropy diverges and the negativity reaches its maximal value of @xmath83 where it is not differentiable .    for the nearest neighbour coupling ( a and c ) the negativity and entropy show qualitatively the same behaviour .",
    "this can be understood easily as any entanglement of an site with the rest of the chain , measured by the von neumann entropy , is created by the coupling with only the nearest neighbours . for the long - range interaction ( b and d ) , where a single site couples to all other sites , there are significant differences between the two entanglement measures .",
    "while the negativity of two nearest neighbour sites vanishes after a threshold value of @xmath0 , each single site remains entangled with the rest of the chain , as seen by the positive value of the von neumann entropy .",
    "both entanglement measures are functions of the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian .",
    "therefore abrupt changes in entanglement can signal non - analyticity of ground state energy , which is associated with qpt s .",
    "in @xcite it was shown for finite dimensional systems that ( under certain conditions ) a discontinuity in or divergence of the first derivative of the negativity is both necessary and sufficient to signal a qpt .",
    "it seems intuitive that a similar characterisation holds also for continuous variable systems . here",
    "the divergence of entropy and finite discontinuity of the first derivative of negativity shows a qpt of second order .",
    "after the phase transition the violated negativity criterion switches from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "lowering the trapping potential further leads to another `` critical '' point @xmath87 at which the negativity becomes zero while the entropy reaches its minimal ( non - zero ) value .",
    "this graphic shows the change of trapping potential in @xmath9 direction .",
    "different geometries favour different momenta , as indicated with the arrows.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the additional critical point @xmath87 ( and @xmath88 in ( b ) ) only appears when the interaction is harmonic as is the case in our second order approximation of the coulomb model .",
    "the point is due to a sign change of the second order coefficient @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) at @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) . as a consequence the interaction switches from repulsive to attractive . when anharmonic terms are taken into account , as in the numerical treatment in @xcite",
    ", these points vanish . an intuitive way of understanding the switching between @xmath68 and @xmath69 is as follows , see fig .",
    "[ fig : potentials ] . decreasing the trapping potential changes the relative strengths of the inner and outer potential for the motion in the @xmath9 direction .",
    "this leads to the change in phase in the relative momenta of neighbouring sites . in one configuration",
    "the relative potential favours momenta in the opposite directions , while the other configuration favours motion in the same direction .",
    "this is reflected in the change from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "however , although the negativity vanishes at these points , a single site is still entangled with the rest of the chain .",
    "this graphic shows the block entropy for different number of sites in @xmath5 ( a ) and @xmath9 ( b ) dimension for long range interaction in the thermodynamical limit .",
    "the entropy increases with number of sites .",
    "the inset ( c ) shows the entanglement connections between nearest neighbour and next nearest neigbour ( nnn ) sites . ]",
    "the block entropy measures how much entanglement exists between a block of sites of the lattice and the rest .",
    "for nearest neighbour interaction models there exist scaling laws showing that the amount of entanglement scales with the boundary area and not the volume of the reduced state @xcite . for a translational invariant chain with nn interaction there",
    "exists even a computable analytical result for the negativity of a bisected harmonic chain @xcite .",
    "here we investigate the block entropy for blocks up to three sites in the long - ranged coulomb lattice . due to the complexity of lr interactions few results are known so far .",
    "the inset ( c ) illustrates the increase of correlation across the block boundary with increasing block size .",
    "correlations stretch to nearest neighbours ( nn ) and next - nearest neighbour ( nnn ) , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : blockentropy ] while third neighbour entanglement is negligible .",
    "increasing the block size from one to two there are twice as many nnn connections across the boundary and hence the block entropy for two sites is expected to increase .",
    "this intuition is confirmed in a ) and b ) showing the block entropy in @xmath5 and @xmath9 direction , repectively .",
    "however , it can be seen that the while the entropy increases slightly with number of sites , no qualitative difference can be observed .",
    "this is due to the fact that the additional , long range entanglement is much weaker because the coulomb potential falls of quickly , with @xmath91 where @xmath66 is the distance of sites . in @xmath9 dimension ( b )",
    "already the single site entropy is a good approximation for larger blocks .",
    "this is because transversal next nearest neighbour entanglement turns out to be very small . in @xmath5 direction ( a )",
    "there are significant differences for growing block sites . here",
    "next nearest neighbour entanglement can not be neglected .",
    "although the number of connections between two and three sites is the same , the block three entropy is still higher .",
    "this might be due to multipartite entanglement .",
    "larger block sites are difficult to evaluate , as the symplectic eigenvalues of the covariance matrix become very complicated .",
    "one consequence of the entanglement of the sites is a lowering of the energy of the system @xcite .",
    "this can be seen by assuming that the thermal state of the system is separable , i.e. decoupled between modes .",
    "then an effective , single site hamiltonian can be obtained by removing all second order couplings between the different sites , i.e. @xmath92 etc .. the total hamiltonian becomes the sum of the single site hamiltonian @xmath93 with @xmath94 where @xmath95 then the thermal state takes the form @xmath96},\\ ] ] with @xmath97 the inverse temperature . using the transformations eq .",

    "the internal energy @xmath99 for any separable state is bounded from below by zero point fluctuations , i.e. @xmath100 and any state having a smaller energy must be entangled between the individual sites .     this graphic shows the negativity in @xmath9 direction of two neighbouring ions for decreasing trapping potential and increasing temperature ( in units of @xmath101=\\sqrt{\\frac{q^2}{m a^3}}$ ] and @xmath102=[\\nu_t ] \\frac{\\hbar}{2 k_b}$ ] , @xmath103 ) .",

    "as the energy of the thermal state , i.e. the mean excitation of phonons , increases with temperature there exists a critical temperature , @xmath104 , for each value of the trapping potential at which the thermal state matches the energy bound .",
    "the negativity between the @xmath9 degrees of freedom of two nearest neighbours for nn hamiltonian is evaluated numerically and plotted in fig .",

    "when the trapping potential is lowered , the negativity increases until reaching its maximal value at the critical @xmath15 .",
    "further lowering leads to a decrease of the negativity until it vanishes at point @xmath87 .",
    "however , when further decreasing @xmath0 the negativity grows again , yet the two entanglement criteria @xmath77 are now switched . as expected ,",
    "increasing the temperature leads to smaller values of negativity and smoothens the entanglement measures to make it differentiable at the critical point . for large @xmath0",
    "the negativity is small , but remains finite until relatively high temperature .",
    "the sharp peak at the qpt remains almost constant for finite @xmath105 and decreases fast .",
    "thermal states within the red outlined area have a smaller energy than any separable state and their entanglement is therefore detected by the energy witness .",
    "remarkably , states at @xmath87 are entangled for temperatures up to @xmath106=0.12\\frac { [ \\nu_t ] \\hbar}{2 k_b}$ ] , even though there is no nearest neighbour entanglement in @xmath9 direction .",
    "this is because there is still nearest neighbour entanglement in @xmath5 direction and possibly also multipartite entanglement the chain .",
    "in this paper , we revised the classical phase transition in a long range harmonic chain @xcite using a fully quantised model .",
    "two measures of entanglement display critical behaviour : the von neumann entropy of a single site and blocks of two and three sites diverge at the critical point while the negativity is not differentiable . thus also in this continuous variable system entanglement indicates a qpt , as previously shown for discrete systems @xcite .",
    "the negativity depends only on single site and nearest neighbour correlations ; the single site von neumann entropy even only depends on single site measurements .",
    "our calculation shows that even this local , single site function is able to detect a global change in configuration .",
    "this implies that instead of examining two point correlations functions one can alternatively consider the entanglement measures stated .",
    "this will be advantageous in experimental situations when the number of different measurement procedures is best kept as low as possible .",
    "we are aware that for the moment ion traps can not yet perform the required measurements of e.g. single site variance of space and momentum operator , but this is a technical , not a fundamental problem .",
    "furthermore , our results confirm that this phase transition is of second order as indicated in @xcite . at finite temperature , the negativity still displays critical behaviour , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tempy ] , however the non - differentiable cusp fades out quickly with increasing thermal noise .",
