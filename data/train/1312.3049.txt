    "pulsars are very stable natural clocks with observed steady pulses . however , many pulsars exhibit significant timing irregularities , i.e. , unpredicted arrival times of pulses .",
    "hobbs et al . ( 2010 , hereafter h2010 ) carried out so far the most extensive study of the long - term timing irregularities of 366 pulsars , and ruled out some timing noise models in terms of observational imperfections , random walks ( boynton 1972 ; alpar et al . 1986 ; cheng 1987a , 1987b ) , and planetary companions ( cordes & shannon 2008 ) .",
    "lyne et al . ( 2010 , hereafter l2010 ) found that timing behaviors often result from two different spin - down rates , and pulsars switch abruptly between these states , often quasi - periodically , leading to the observed spin - down patterns .",
    "the deviations of pulsars spin frequency @xmath0 from its long - term trend are correlated with changes in the pulse shapes ( see fig . 3 and 4 of l2010 ) , and therefore are magnetospheric in origin . by modeling the observed precise timing data of pulsars , we will show that the long - term linear change of @xmath1 is consistent with the timescale of hall drift , and the oscillatory structure of @xmath1 and the changes in pulse shapes can be produced by the hall waves in the crust of a neutron star ( ns ) .",
    "consequently the mechanism of magnetic field evolution and the origin of the timing noise of pulsars are better understood , which may improve the sensitivity of gravitational wave detections with pulsars .",
    "assuming the pure magnetic dipole radiation in vacuum as the braking mechanism for a pulsar s spin - down ( e.g. lorimer & kramer 2004 ) , we have @xmath2 in which @xmath3 is a constant , @xmath4 is the strength of the dipole magnetic field at the surface of the ns , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are the radius , moment of inertia , and angle of magnetic inclination , respectively .",
    "previously , we constructed a phenomenological model for @xmath4 with a long - term evolution modulated by short - term oscillations ( zhang & xie 2012a and 2012b , hereafter paper  i and paper  ii , respectively ) : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the pulsar s age , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the amplitude , phase and period of the @xmath13-th oscillating component , respectively .",
    "@xmath14 , in which @xmath15 is the field strength at age @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is the power law index . then from equation ( [ b evolution ] ) and taking only the dominating oscillating component , we obtained the analytic approximation for @xmath18 ( paper  i ) : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the real age of the pulsar and @xmath21 for the dominating oscillating component .",
    "it has been found that equation  ( [ vddot ] ) describes adequately the statistical properties of the observed timing noises of radio pulsars ( paper  i ) .",
    "therefore for relatively young pulsars with @xmath22  yr , the first term in equation  ( [ vddot ] ) dominates and we should have @xmath23 if @xmath24 . considering that the characteristic ages ( @xmath25 ) of young pulsars are normally several times larger than @xmath26 , equation  ( [ vddot ] ) thus explains naturally the observed @xmath27 for most young pulsars with @xmath28 yr .",
    "similarly for much older pulsars , the second term in equation  ( [ vddot ] ) dominates , in agreement with the observational fact that the numbers of negative and positive @xmath18 are almost equal for the old pulsars in the sample of h2010 .",
    "the confirmation of equation  ( [ vddot ] ) with observations naturally suggests that the observed pulsars indeed have evolutionary links , and the equation therefore provides details about the dipole magnetic field evolution of a young pulsar into an old pulsar .",
    "however , equation  ( [ vddot ] ) has so far not been tested with the observed evolutions of individual pulsars .",
    "following the same approach in paper  i , we obtain @xmath29 where @xmath30 , @xmath31 describes the long - term monotonic variation of @xmath0",
    ". therefore equation  ( [ vdot ] ) can be tested with the long - term monitoring observations of individual pulsars .",
    "we can obtain an estimate of @xmath32 by linearly fitting the long - term monotonic variation of reported @xmath0 .",
    "consequently we can also determine the time scale of the long - term magnetic field evolution of each pulsar ( see equation  ( 6 ) in paper  i ) @xmath33 for comparisons with theoretical models of neutron star magnetic field evolution .",
    "@xmath34 indicates magnetic field decrease and vice versa .",
    "the sample of l2010 provides the precise histories of @xmath1 for seventeen pulsars and thus may be applied to test equation  ( [ vdot ] ) .",
    "lyne et al . ( 2010 ) found that psr b1828@xmath3511 clearly shows a long - term evolution trend ( noticed in l2010 as a linear increase of its @xmath1 ) , i.e. @xmath36 .",
    "we show the comparison between the reported ( taken from l2010 ) and analytically calculated @xmath0 for the pulsar in figure [ fig:1 ] ; all the parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "the one major difference is caused by the decrease of the oscillation periods of the reported data after @xmath37  days , which indicates that the oscillations are unlikely caused by precession of the neutron star .",
    "nevertheless , our model describes the general trend of the reported data of b1828 quite well .    by linearly fitting @xmath1 of all other pulsars",
    ", we find that most of them also exhibit long - term monotonic evolutions modulated by short - term quasi - periodical oscillations .",
    "however , three pulsars in the sample , namely , b1822 - 09 , b2035 + 36 and j2043 + 2740 , exhibit much more erratic short - term behaviors , which may significantly bias the fitting results ; here we exclude these three pulsars from further study . we conclude that our phenomenological model can describe adequately the spin - down evolutions of fourteen pulsars in the sample of seventeen pulsars of l2010 ; all the observed and derived parameters for the fourteen pulsars are listed in table 1 .",
    "we first investigate the alternative possibility that the long - term linear change of @xmath0 is caused by the change of the inclination angle of a ns , rather than the change of its magnetic field strength .",
    "observationally , the inclination angle change would also produce a long - term change on the width of pulses . for a circular beam",
    ", the change of its width can be given by the geometrical relation @xmath38^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the magnitude of the inclination angle change that can be obtained from @xmath40 for psr b1828@xmath3511 ( @xmath41 is the time span of the observations ) , @xmath42 is the impact angle , @xmath43 is the half angular width of the radiating cone ( gil et al .",
    "1984 ) , @xmath44^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\ ] ] @xmath45 is the initial pulse profile width of b1828@xmath3511 ( l2010 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath46 only depends on @xmath47 and @xmath42 .",
    "there are two observational constraints for @xmath47 and @xmath42 for b1828@xmath3511 : ( a ) @xmath48 ms ( l2010 ) ; and ( b ) its position angle ( p.a . )",
    "gives @xmath49 ( gould & lyne 1998 ) .",
    "we show the comparison of the two constraints on @xmath47 and @xmath42 in figure [ fig:3 ] .",
    "one can see that condition ( a ) requires @xmath50 , which is much smaller than that from condition ( b ) ; thus the possibility of inclination angle change is ruled out for b1828@xmath3511 .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to assume that the long - term linear changes of @xmath0 for other pulsars in the sample are also not caused by the changes of their inclination angles , because the patterns of their spin - down evolutions are very similar to psr b1828@xmath3511 .",
    "goldreich & reisenegger ( 1992 ) studied several avenues for magnetic field decay in isolated nss : ohmic decay , ambipolar diffusion , and hall drift .",
    "depending on the strength of the magnetic fields , each of these processes may dominate the evolution , and the ambipolar diffusion is only important for magnetars .",
    "ohmic decay occurs in both the fluid core and solid crust of a ns ( sang & chanmugam 1987 ; urpin et al .",
    "1994 ; page et al .",
    "it is inversely proportional to the electric conductivity and independent of the strength of magnetic fields . if an electric current flows vertically in magnetic fields , the fields exerts a transverse force on the moving charge carriers .",
    "the resulting hall drift of the carriers can transport magnetic fields from the inner crust to the outer crust ( jones 1988 ) .",
    "the hall effect is non - dissipative and thus can not be a direct cause of magnetic field decay .",
    "however , it can enhance the rate of ohmic dissipation , since only electrons are mobile in the solid crust , and their hall angle is large .",
    "consequently the evolution of magnetic fields resembles that of vorticity , and then the fields undergo a turbulent cascade terminated by ohmic dissipation at small scales ( goldreich & reisenegger 1992 ; muslimov 1994 ; biskamp & m@xmath51ller 1999 ; urpin & shalybkov 1999 ; rheinhardt & geppert 2002 ; geppert & rheinhardt 2002 ; pons & geppert 2010 ; geppert et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "cumming et al .",
    "( 2004 , hereafter c2004 ) found that , in isolated nss with relatively pure crusts , the hall effect dominates over ohmic decay after a time @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is in units of @xmath54 g. this is consistent with the fact that @xmath55 is much shorter than the ohmic timescale @xmath56 yr . at lower densities of the crust ,",
    "the degenerated electrons contribute to the pressure , and the hall timescale ( @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the decay rate induced by hall effect ) is ( c2004 ) @xmath59 in which @xmath60 , @xmath61 is the number fraction of electrons , and @xmath62 is the local gravity , assumed constant . at densities greater than neutron drip ,",
    "the neutrons dominate the pressure ( c2004 ) , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the number fraction of neutrons , and @xmath65 is the factor that accounts for the interactions between neutrons .    in the top panel of figure [ fig:4 ]",
    ", it is shown that there is no significant correlation between @xmath66 and @xmath67 . in the second and third panels ,",
    "we show that @xmath68 is consistent with @xmath67 for eight pulsars and @xmath69 is for the other six pulsars . here , the outer and inner crusts are defined by @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , yielding the upper and lower limits for @xmath72 plotted in the second and third panels of figure [ fig:4 ] .",
    "this implies that the hall drift is responsible for their observed long - term evolutions in @xmath73 . in other words ,",
    "the evolution of their crustal magnetic fields , rather than that in their cores , dominates the observed long term spin - down evolution of these young pulsars . assuming @xmath74",
    ", we obtain an effective density @xmath75 , which may be useful to indicate the location of the majority of the magnetic field lines in the ns crusts .",
    "the values of @xmath75 are shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig:4 ] .",
    "the hall drift can also pump energy from an internal strong toroidal field to the dipolar poloidal component on a timescale of @xmath76 ( pons et al .",
    "2012 ; gourgouliatos & cumming 2014 ) , resulting in increased @xmath73 for a pulsar . therefore the hall drift can cause both long term decrease and increase of @xmath73 in a pulsar .",
    "figure 3 shows that all the fourteen pulsars are quite young ( with @xmath77  yr ) and only three of the four pulsars are observed with long term increase of @xmath73 , i.e. , @xmath78 .",
    "this is consistent with our previous result that the long - term decrease of magnetic fields are more frequently observed for young pulsars ( paper  i ) , suggesting that the hall drift tends to generate more magnetic field decay than increase .",
    "very recently , geppert et al .",
    "( 2013 ) found that the hall drift can produce small - scale strong surface magnetic field anomalies ( spots ) due to the interaction of the  initially \" dipolar field with the strong toroidal crustal component , which is fundamental for generating observable radio emission .",
    "besides , there is a large scale dipolar poloidal component which has impact on the braking behavior , and its evolution due to hall drift may be responsible for the long - term monotonic evolutions of @xmath1 .      the above discussed theoretical expectation that the hall drift can produce",
    "both increase and decrease of @xmath73 suggests that an oscillatory mode of @xmath73 in a ns crust may also be produced ; however , the hall timescales ( either @xmath79 or @xmath80 ) are too long for the observed periodicities in pulsar timing noises ( with @xmath81  yr as listed in table 1 ) . on the other hand , the diffusive motion of the magnetic fields can perturb the background magnetic fields ( here the dipole magnetic fields ) at the base of the ns crust .",
    "such perturbations propagate as circularly polarized",
    " hall waves \" along the background field lines upward into the lower density regions in the crusts ( thompson & duncan 1996 ) .",
    "the hall waves can strain the crust with a wave period ( c2004 ) , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the hall timescale at the base of the crust , and @xmath84 is the number of nodes over the crust .",
    "the elastic response of the crust to the hall wave can induce angular displacement @xmath85 , where @xmath86 is the fluid displacement , @xmath87 is the depth of the crust , and @xmath88 is the shear modulus .",
    "the maximum strain occurs at or above the turning point . using the wkb scaling",
    ", it is found that at the turning point ( c2004 ) , @xmath89 in which @xmath90 is the amplitude of the mode at the base of the crust .",
    "the density at the turning point can then be calculated from ( c2004 ) @xmath91    since most of the dipole field lines are collected at the polar regions of nss , the strains at the regions are especially strong .",
    "the elastic responses of the crusts to the waves induce changes of the areas of polar regions , producing both pulse shape changes and oscillations in @xmath1 .",
    "the quasi - periodical oscillations in @xmath1 and time residuals can be caused by the hall waves , i.e. , @xmath92 .",
    "the calculated parameters from the above equations are also listed in table 1 .",
    "the values of @xmath93 are moderate for the theoretically predicted density at the turning point . above the turning point , the perturbation on magnetic fields @xmath94 decreases to match the boundary condition @xmath95 .",
    "the variation in @xmath96 roughly correlates with @xmath97 as @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the amplitude of the oscillations in @xmath100 .    from equation  ( [ vdot ] )",
    ", we have @xmath101 . for b1828@xmath3511 , @xmath102 , which is roughly the same as @xmath103 (",
    "listed in table 1 ) ; here @xmath104 is defined as the peak - to - peak amplitude of the oscillations .",
    "the small difference between @xmath105 and @xmath106 is due to the partial cancellation of the two harmonics with the same amplitude , but different phases . for the other thirteen pulsars ,",
    "@xmath107 is not available and we thus assume @xmath108 , which is reasonable because only one significant periodicity has been observed for each of them . assuming @xmath109 , @xmath110 can be calculated , as listed in table 1 .",
    "finally we can constrain @xmath111 ( the last column in the two tables ) , which is consistent with @xmath112 usually assumed in theoretical calculations ( e.g. thompson & duncan 1996 ) .",
    "in this work , we applied the phenomenological model of pulsar timing noise we developed recently to the observed precise timing data of young radio pulsars , and analyzed the influence of the hall effects in ns crusts on the magnetic field evolutions .",
    "this is the first time that the two aspects of the hall effect , i.e. , hall drift and waves , are correlated with observational data for individual pulsars .",
    "we obtained the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "the @xmath1 evolutions for most of the pulsars in l2010 sample can be described adequately with our phenomenological model consisting a long - term monotonic change and short - term oscillations in @xmath0 ; 2 .",
    "the observed long - term monotonic changes in @xmath0 can be interpreted with the hall drifts in ns crusts ; 3 .",
    "the observed short - term oscillations in @xmath0 and in pulse shapes can be produced by the hall waves in ns crusts .    in a unified view , the long - term evolutions in @xmath1 can be understood as that they are caused by the hall waves with very low harmonics ( @xmath113 ) . actually , goldreich & reisenegger ( 1992 ) conjectured a turbulent hall cascade , transferring energy from large to small scales , with an energy spectrum @xmath114 ( where @xmath115 is the wavenumber ) .",
    "however , it is still unclear that why the high harmonics ( e.g. @xmath116 ) dominate in all pulsars we studied here .",
    "it is probably due to some selection biases that the observational time spans for all pulsars are only a few decades .",
    "indeed , hobbs et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found that the structures seen in the timing noise vary with data span ; as more data are collected , more quasi - periodic features are observed .",
    "to ultimately address these questions , the power spectrum and the physical origin of the hall waves need to be investigated in detail in future works .",
    "as we have discussed above and shown previously , the long - term evolution of @xmath73 of young pulsars are quite similar to that of the ( young ) pulsars studied here .",
    "in addition , the huge spans of the reported braking indices of all pulsars can be naturally explained by short - term oscillations of their @xmath73 with characteristics also similar to that of these pulsars .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to assume that the hall effects we studied here are also responsible for the observed spin evolutions of essentially all pulsars , including millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "physically both a long - lived core based dipolar field and a crustal field should coexist and be superimposed for a young pulsar .",
    "however , it is likely that the  observed \" features , with e.g. @xmath117  yr , are caused by the crustal field , whose evolution proceeds faster than that of the core field , due to hall effect and finite conductivity in its crust . as the pulsar ages , its crustal field is gradually dissipated and",
    "the core field begins to dominate its spin - down evolution . in this scenario",
    "we would expect much longer @xmath118 for millisecond pulsars .",
    "unfortunately , currently the data on the evolutions of @xmath1 of millisecond pulsars are not available with comparable details as for those normal radio pulsars studied here ( l2010 ) .",
    "this is because that millisecond pulsars have much weaker dipole magnetic fields , implying much smaller @xmath110 and @xmath119 , which is actually the basis for using them to detect gravitational waves .",
    "availability of higher quality timing data of millisecond pulsars from the current on - going pulsar timing array observations ( haasteren et al . 2011 ; demorest et al . 2013 ; manchester et al . 2013 ) may allow both the long - term monotonic evolutions and short oscillations to be identified for individual millisecond pulsars , which will improve the current gravitational - wave limits ( shannon et al . 2013 ) .",
