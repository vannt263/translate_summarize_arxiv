    "plasma turbulence is one of the most widespread collective phenomena occurring in nature .",
    "it appears to be present throughout the universe , in a diverse range of environments , including galaxy clusters , accretion disks , the interstellar medium , stars , stellar winds , and planetary magnetospheres . while being an intriguing and complex aspect of our universe of intrinsic interest , it can also have an important impact on the large - scale properties of these systems .",
    "for example , it can enable angular momentum transport in accretion disks @xcite , galactic magnetic field amplification @xcite , limit thermal conduction in galaxy clusters @xcite , determine the dispersal and mixing of elements in the interstellar medium @xcite , and play a key role in star formation @xcite .",
    "in addition , the dissipation of turbulent energy may explain the large temperatures observed in many astrophysical systems , such as the solar corona @xcite , and galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "turbulent plasmas display complex , chaotic , broadband fluctuations , which are generally interpreted as a scale - invariant cascade of energy from large scales , where the energy is injected , to small scales , where it is dissipated .",
    "however , many questions remain about both the cascade and dissipation processes .",
    "the solar wind presents one of the best places to understand the basic physics of plasma turbulence .",
    "the main reason for this is that _ in situ _ spacecraft measurements are possible , meaning that a wealth of information is available , unlike for plasmas outside our solar system .",
    "it is also fast flowing , travelling much quicker than the local alfvn speed and turbulent fluctuation amplitudes , meaning that time series measured by spacecraft can generally be interpreted as spatial cuts though the plasma ( the taylor hypothesis ) , enabling them to be readily compared to theoretical predictions .",
    "the majority of solar wind turbulence measurements , and most of those described in this paper , have been made in the near - earth solar wind .",
    "typical plasma conditions here are : magnetic field strength @xmath0 , number density @xmath1 , bulk speed @xmath2 , and ion and electron temperatures @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which give ion and electron plasma betas of order unity , @xmath5 .",
    "the dominant ion species ( to which these parameters refer ) is hydrogen , with helium and other minor ions making up a few per cent of the solar wind by number density .",
    "it is important to note , however , that there is large a variation in all of these values , making the solar wind an ideal place for parameter studies of plasma processes , applicable to a wide variety of astrophysical environments .",
    "this paper summarises some of the recent progress that has been made in understanding solar wind turbulence .",
    "it is not intended to be a complete review ; for general review papers on solar wind observations see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite , and the collection of @xcite .",
    "it also primarily summarises work in which i have been involved , with other results and theoretical background described for context .",
    "therefore , it is not an unbiased review , but presents a viewpoint , based on the latest observations and theoretical developments .",
    "the solar wind has long been known to contain large scale alfvnically polarised fluctuations , consistent with predominant propagation away from the sun ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "these are thought to be alfvn waves , generated at or near the sun , which propagate into interplanetary space and drive a turbulent cascade .",
    "the magnetic fluctuations at these large scales are often seen to have a @xmath6 frequency spectrum , which has been interpreted as arising from uncorrelated processes at the sun @xcite or a reflection driven cascade @xcite . here , we are concerned with the smaller scale turbulence driven by these large scale fluctuations . in this range ,",
    "the alfvnically polarised fluctuations remain dominant , and in this section our recent progress on this turbulence is discussed .",
    "alfvnic turbulence is thought to be captured by the incompressible mhd equations , which in fluctuating @xcite form ( omitting forcing and dissipation terms ) are @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the fluctuating elsasser variables , @xmath10 is the bulk velocity , @xmath11 is the magnetic field in alfvn units , @xmath12 is the mass density , @xmath13 is the alfvn speed , @xmath14 contains the total ( thermal plus magnetic ) pressure , and @xmath15 is the gradient in the direction of the mean magnetic field @xmath16 .",
    "an early model of alfvnic turbulence , based on these equations , was developed by @xcite and @xcite . from the form of the nonlinear terms ( @xmath17 )",
    "it was realised that nonlinear interactions occur via oppositely propagating alfvn wave packets ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) .",
    "the turbulence was assumed to be isotropic so that the presence of a strong mean magnetic field would lead to weak interactions ( the linear terms dominating in equation [ eq : mhd ] ) , requiring many such interactions to transfer the energy to a smaller scale . when a constant energy flux through scales is assumed , scaling arguments based on the cascade time lead to an inertial range total energy spectrum @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the wavenumber of the fluctuations .",
    "weak alfvnic turbulence , however , was later shown to develop strong anisotropy , with a spectrum perpendicular to mean magnetic field of @xmath22 and no transfer in the parallel direction @xcite .",
    "this leads to a violation of both the isotropic and weak assumptions as the cascade proceeds to smaller scales , since the degree of non - linearity increases with wavenumber .",
    "@xcite proposed that a state of critical balance is reached in which the linear and nonlinear terms become ( and remain ) comparable , and the transfer to smaller scales occurs within a single interaction . from equation [ eq : mhd ] ,",
    "the linear alfvn time is @xmath23 ( where @xmath24 is the scale parallel to the mean magnetic field ) and the nonlinear time was estimated as @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 is the perpendicular scale ) , which , when equated , lead to a scaling @xmath27 .",
    "this results in an anisotropy @xmath28 at small scales and energy spectra @xmath29 since the nonlinear transfer occurs within one interaction , turbulence in critical balance is considered to be strong at all scales , even when @xmath30 .",
    "@xcite later noted that the nonlinear time should contain an extra factor of the alignment angle @xmath31 between the fluctuations @xmath32 .",
    "this is because both the fluctuations and their gradients are mostly in the plane perpendicular to the mean field , and within this plane the gradients are perpendicular to the fluctuations due to solenoidality , leading to a greater reduction of the nonlinear terms if the fluctuations are more aligned .",
    "it was proposed that @xmath33 and @xmath34 align to the maximum amount permitted at each scale , leading to @xmath35 , and three - dimensionally anisotropic eddies at small scales @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the characteristic length in the fluctuation direction and @xmath38 in the direction perpendicular to @xmath24 and @xmath37 .",
    "the resulting spectra are @xmath39 in more recent years , further additions to these models have been proposed to allow for the imbalance of the oppositely directed alfvnic fluxes @xcite and intermittency @xcite . while models such as these are at the phenomenological level , they provide scaling predictions that can be compared to observations to distinguish the physical processes taking place .      it is well known that alfvnic turbulence in the solar wind is anisotropic ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "correlation lengths are typically observed to be much longer in the direction parallel to the mean magnetic field than perpendicular , consistent with the anisotropy @xmath28 implied by the above strong turbulence models .",
    "more recently , however , new techniques have been developed to measure the anisotropic scaling , as a more direct test . in the above models ,",
    "the parallel length scale is associated with the linear term , corresponding to the propagation of alfvn wave packets , which are sensitive to the mean magnetic field at their location and scale , i.e. , the local mean field .",
    "the need to use such a mean field to test the critical balance predictions was identified in simulations @xcite and a technique to do this in the solar wind , making use of the wavelet transform , was developed by @xcite . at each location , and at each scale ( i.e. for each wavelet coefficient in the transform ) , a local mean field can be defined from the average of the magnetic field weighted by the corresponding wavelet envelope .",
    "fluctuations at a range of scales at a particular angle to the local mean field can be gathered to produce the spectrum in that direction .",
    "a similar technique can be applied to structure functions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , for which the local mean field can be defined as the average between the points of the structure function . in practice ,",
    "the results are not sensitive to this precise definition , as long as a local ( and not global ) mean field is used .    .",

    "the results of the local structure function technique @xcite , applied to the same magnetic field data as in @xcite , are shown in figure [ fig : cb ] . ] .",
    "it can be seen that at large scales ( @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the ion gyroradius ) the turbulence is isotropic @xcite with @xmath44 , and in the inertial range ( @xmath45 ) the parallel spectrum is steeper than the perpendicular spectrum .",
    "the inertial range spectral index as a function of angle to the local mean field , @xmath46 , is shown in figure [ fig : cb]b .",
    "the perpendicular spectrum is closer to the @xmath47 prediction of @xcite than the @xmath48 prediction of @xcite , but the parallel spectrum is consistent with the @xmath49 critical balance prediction of both models spectrum could also be interpreted as a reflection of the lagrangian frequency spectrum . ] .",
    "@xcite also found a @xmath49 spectrum for the velocity and dominant elsasser field ( although instrumental noise made it difficult to measure the anisotropy of the sub - dominant elsasser field ) .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath49 spectrum is only observed when a scale - dependent local mean field is used ; a global mean field can not be used to test critical balance , since , even for arbitrarily small @xmath50 , the predicted anisotropy would be just large enough that the true local parallel correlation would not be measured @xcite .    an alternative way to test",
    "the critical balance condition is to estimate the turbulence strength directly from the measured timescales .",
    "the parallel and perpendicular lengths of an `` eddy '' of amplitude @xmath51 can be found using the technique of @xcite .",
    "for a particular @xmath51 , for example the horizontal dotted line in figure [ fig : cb]a , @xmath52 is estimated as the wavenumber corresponding to the parallel spectrum ( blue vertical dotted line ) and @xmath53 as the wavenumber corresponding to the perpendicular spectrum ( red vertical dotted line ) . from this , the wavevector anisotropy can be determined , e.g. , at @xmath54 the anisotropy is @xmath55 , corresponding to a wavevector angle @xmath56 .",

    "the electric field was measured by @xcite to follow the magnetic field , having a spectral index of @xmath62 at mhd scales , spectra measured in the solar wind generally correspond to @xmath53 spectra ( unless the local mean field technique of section [ sec : cb ] is used ) . ] .",
    "since the perpendicular plasma velocity in this range should be the @xmath63 drift , the velocity was expected to display a similar spectrum , however , it has been shown to be shallower , with a value nearer @xmath64 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". how can these spectra be consistent with each other ?",
    "the answer lies in the frame dependence of the electric field @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] shows the electric field spectrum measured in the spacecraft frame @xmath65 with a spectral index near @xmath62 , similar to the magnetic field .",
    "it also shows the electric field spectrum after lorentz transforming to the frame of the mean solar wind velocity @xmath66 , @xmath67 it can be seen that the solar wind frame spectrum is lower by an order of magnitude and is shallower , having a spectral index close to @xmath64 .",
    "these spectra are , therefore , in fact consistent with the velocity and magnetic field measurements , and are independent confirmation of the difference between them .",
    "the @xmath68 spectrum matches the velocity spectrum since to leading order it is given by @xmath69 , and the @xmath70 spectrum matches the magnetic spectrum since to leading order it is @xmath71 , i.e. , it is dominated by the magnetic fluctuations convected at the mean solar wind velocity .",
    "while the electric , magnetic , and velocity spectra are self - consistent , the question remains why the velocity and magnetic fluctuations differ .",
    "this difference is known as the residual energy , and its spectrum is defined as @xmath72 .",
    "a measure of the amount of residual energy is the alfvn ratio @xmath73 , which is @xmath74 for a pure alfvn wave , but is measured to be @xmath75 in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "statistical arguments have been made to explain this dominance of magnetic fluctuation energy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the existence of residual energy , both theoretically and observationally , indicates that strong turbulence can produce quantitative differences to the linear wave relationships .",
    "the residual energy has also been described as a balance between the alfvn effect ( linear term ) leading to equipartition and a turbulent dynamo ( nonlinear term ) generating the magnetic excess @xcite .",
    "@xcite used an isotropic closure theory to suggest that @xmath60 varies with the total energy spectrum @xmath76 , following @xmath77 for a @xmath78 total energy spectrum and @xmath79 for a @xmath80 total energy spectrum .",

    "there is also evidence that it is anisotropic and concentrated in the region near @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "these observations would be most consistent with the strong turbulence model of @xcite , which provides a possible explanation for the different scaling of the velocity and magnetic fluctuations .",

    "they vary from being extended in the @xmath89 direction at large scales , to being 3d anisotropic in the sense of @xcite at small scales .",
    "while the small scale anisotropy ( @xmath92 ) and the scaling in the @xmath24 and @xmath37 directions is consistent with the @xcite model , the @xmath38 scaling is not .",
    "there are a few considerations when interpreting these results .",
    "firstly , one might expect the anisotropy with respect to the @xmath91 direction to be a simple result of the solenoidality of the magnetic field .",
    "however , it can be shown that solenoidality alone does not determine the anisotropy in the local perpendicular plane @xcite , and extra physics , such as alignment @xcite is involved .",
    "secondly , it has been suggested that the anisotropy in the perpendicular plane at large scales could be a result of the solar wind expansion as it travels away from the sun .",
    "@xcite argued that magnetic flux conservation in the expanding wind causes fluctuations in the radial direction to be smaller , leading to a bias towards lower fluctuation amplitudes in the @xmath37 direction when measurements are made in the radial direction .",
    "some evidence in support of this hypothesis has recently been reported @xcite . as well as",
    "the eddy shapes , this effect could also alter the 3d scaling , since any effect of the expansion relative to the turbulent dynamics is likely to be scale - dependent . finally , as discussed in section [ sec : indices ] , the situation is further complicated by the presence of residual energy , which causes the magnetic spectrum to be steeper than the velocity spectrum ; how this impacts the 3d anisotropy is not yet well understood .",
    "therefore , while observations show that alfvnic turbulence in the solar wind is locally three - dimensionally anisotropic , more work is required to fully understand this .      as shown in section [ sec : indices ] , the scaling of the velocity and magnetic fluctuations is different , so it is the total energy spectrum @xmath93 which should be compared to the models of section [ sec : models ] .",
    "these models , however , describe balanced alfvnic turbulence , i.e. , turbulence with equal fluxes of alfvnic fluctuations propagating in each direction along the mean field . in real systems , turbulence is often imbalanced , with unequal fluxes created by localised driving sources , such as supernovae in the interstellar medium or alfvn waves from the sun . in the solar wind , the level of imbalance can be quantified with the normalised cross helicity @xmath94 ; @xmath95 corresponds to balanced turbulence and @xmath96 to highly imbalanced turbulence .",
    "while the solar wind at 1 au has a typical imbalance of @xmath97 @xcite , there is significant variability , enabling the systematic dependence to be studied .",
    "figure [ fig : sigmac ] shows the dependence of the spectral indices on the level of imbalance ( all quantities are measured in the middle of the inertial range ) .",
    "the total energy spectral index varies from @xmath98 at low imbalance to @xmath99 at high imbalance ( as also found by * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath86 and @xmath85 scale similarly for @xmath100 , which is consistent with the residual energy being mathematically constrained to be small for large imbalance .",
    "it is interesting , however , that they take a value close to @xmath64 , favouring the @xcite model in the absence of residual energy .",
    "the residual energy itself has a spectral index of @xmath101 ( see section [ sec : indices ] ) for low imbalance , which becomes shallower for larger imbalance .",
    "both elsasser variables ( not shown here ) have the same scaling as the total energy , to within uncertainties , for all @xmath102 bins where the @xmath103 spectrum is affected by instrumental noise . ] .",
    "the main dependence of the total energy spectrum with @xmath104 , however , is not predicted by any of the current models of imbalanced alfvnic turbulence ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "while the dominant power in the solar wind is in the alfvnically polarised fluctuations , there is also a measurable fraction in non - alfvnic modes , involving variations of the density @xmath105 and magnetic field magnitude @xmath106 . as well as being of intrinsic interest , understanding",

    "this concept was developed further by @xcite , who suggested that for mhd turbulence , slow waves ( or pseudo - alfvn waves in the incompressible limit ) would be passive to the alfvnic turbulence as a result of the anisotropy @xmath28 developed by the cascade .",

    "this would mean that slow wave fluctuations are scattered by the anisotropic alfvnic turbulence , but do not actively interfere with it , which would also result in negligible energy transfer from the alfvnic to slow mode component @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued that for weakly collisional plasmas such as the solar wind , the mhd description is not sufficient for the compressive fluctuations ) alfvn waves at @xmath117 do not modify the maxwellian nature of the ion distribution @xcite . ] , and a kinetic treatment is required . in the gyrokinetic formalism , where @xmath28 is taken as an ordering assumption , the nonlinear fluid equations for the alfvnic turbulence at @xmath117 ( reduced mhd ) decouple from the ion kinetic equation .",
    "the active alfvnic turbulence is self - contained , and passively mixes the non - alfvnic part of the ion distribution , from which the compressive fluctuations ( which produce the kinetic counterparts of the slow and entropy modes ) are obtained @xcite .",
    "therefore , the passivity of these modes , originally derived in the context of fluid models , is predicted to hold for kinetic plasmas too .    in hydrodynamic turbulence , a passive scalar @xmath118 shares the same spectrum as the advecting velocity field @xmath10 ( neglecting intermittency ) .",
    "this is because it follows its continuity equation , @xmath119 , meaning that its nonlinear time @xmath120 is the same as that of the active turbulence , leading to @xmath121 . in plasma turbulence , however , the situation is more complicated , since the nonlinear times involve both the velocity and magnetic fields , and their alignment angles ( see section [ sec : models ] ) .",
    "it is therefore of interest to compare the scaling of the compressive fluctuations in the solar wind to that of the alfvnic turbulence . while spectra of compressive fluctuations have long been measured in the solar wind ( see reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite showed that the spectral indices of both @xmath105 and @xmath109 are close to @xmath62 , similar to the magnetic field , rather than the velocity , which has a @xmath64 spectral index .",
    "an example from this data set is shown in figure [ fig : comphistspectra ] , where the typical features can be seen : compressive fluctuations at a level much lower than the total power , with a spectral slope similar to that of the alfvnic magnetic fluctuations .",
    "this scaling of the compressive fluctuations indicates that they are not passively advected in the hydrodynamic sense .",
    "it is still possible , however , that they are passive to the alfvnic turbulence , in which they are mixed by both the velocity and magnetic fluctuations .",
    "it is also of interest to determine what type of compressive fluctuations are present , i.e. , which wave modes they resemble , and whether these require a kinetic description .",
    "@xcite showed that the kinetic fast and slow modes retain qualitative characteristics of their mhd counterparts , but differ quantitatively so that a kinetic description is necessary .",
    "in particular , @xmath105 and @xmath122 remain predominantly anti - correlated for the slow mode and correlated for the fast mode , with a characteristic ion beta , @xmath123 , dependence .",

    "* ) .,scaledwidth=60.0% ]      an interesting question is why there appears to be a cascade of compressive fluctuations at all , when they are expected to be strongly damped in a @xmath125 plasma @xcite . in particular , their damping rate is @xmath126 , comparable to the timescale on which the alfvnic turbulence would cascade them to small scales .",
    "the solution to this may lie in their anisotropy : if they are significantly more anisotropic than the alfvnic turbulence , i.e. , their @xmath52 remains small , they are not strongly damped .",
    "so what do we expect the anisotropy of passively mixed compressive fluctuations to be ?",
    "@xcite suggested that the slow modes inherit the anisotropy of the alfvnic turbulence that mixes them .",
    "however , @xcite argued that the kinetic equation for the compressive fluctuations becomes linear in the lagrangian frame of the alfvnic turbulence , and , therefore , that they have no parallel cascade .",
    "this would lead to highly elongated , compressive structures , with very small @xmath52 , and could explain why they are not strongly damped .",
    "the 3d shape of the @xmath109 fluctuations was measured ( using the technique described in section [ sec:3d ] ) by @xcite and is shown in figure [ fig : compressiveanisotropy ] , where it can be seen that they are indeed very anisotropic .",

    "the ratio of the anisotropy of the compressive to alfvnic component is shown in the lower panel and can be seen to take a value around 4 throughout most of the inertial range the compressive component anisotropy reduces , becoming closer to that of the alfvnic component , consistent with the @xmath122 of the alfvnic turbulence starting to dominate the compressive spectrum . ] .",
    "due to the angular resolution of the measurements , this is a lower limit : the compressive fluctuations are at least several times more anisotropic than the alfvnic turbulence .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction of @xcite , although there is an alternative interpretation .",
    "it is possible that the cascade attempts to generate compressive fluctuations with an anisotropy similar to the alfvnic turbulence , but these are quickly damped , leaving the highly anisotropic ones to be observed .",
    "so the question becomes : are the compressive fluctuations highly anisotropic because the less anisotropic component is damped , or are they generated highly anisotropic to begin with ? this remains to be answered , but has some interesting implications , e.g. , if damping is taking place , then energy may be being removed from the cascade throughout the inertial range , rather than just at the small scales .",
    "however , a recent suggestion by @xcite is that `` anti - phase - mixing '' may effectively suppress such damping , providing an alternative explanation for the presence of the compressive fluctuations .",

    "this is related to the turbulent energy being concentrated into a smaller fraction of the volume as the cascade proceeds to smaller scales , and results in the formation of energetic structures within the plasma . understanding this intermittency and structure generation is important for both the cascade process and plasma heating , since the energy dissipation is thought to be focussed at these structures .    as a result of the alfvnic cascade ,",
    "the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of the fluctuations are significantly non - gaussian by the time ion scales @xmath164 are reached .",
    "recently , it has been possible to investigate how the pdf shape continues to change down to electron scales .",

    "@xcite found a similar behaviour for the density fluctuation pdfs , which are shown in figure [ fig : intermittency ] , along with the magnetic fluctuations .",
    "the similar behaviour of the density and magnetic fluctuations in the kinetic range is expected , since in kinetic alfvn turbulence these fields are directly coupled ( section [ sec : kineticmodels ] ) , although the self - similarity of the pdfs is unusual for a turbulent cascade .",
    "one possibility is that kinetic range turbulence is inherently mono - fractal ; although a recent measurement of the multi - fractal spectrum by @xcite showed a larger multi - fractality in the the kinetic range .",
    "another possibility is that the kurtosis of the fluctuations is limited by another process , such as the instability of the current sheet structures which may form @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the intermittency in the kinetic range remains to be fully understood .",
    "an alternative way to examine intermittency is through the distribution of rotation angles of the magnetic field .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath169 is defined as the angle through which the field rotates over a given spatial scale ( or time scale @xmath170 measured by a spacecraft under the taylor hypothesis ) , @xmath171,\\ ] ] and has been used to study both the intermittency and the structures that are formed ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "it was found that , similar to larger scales @xcite , the pdfs of @xmath169 are well - fit by log - normal distributions , with only small changes in shape from ion to electron scales .",
    "the large rotations are sometimes identified as the `` structures '' , so it is of interest to investigate their distribution , how much energy they contain , and how large the rotations are .",

    "while we have made significant progress in recent years , there are still many aspects of astrophysical plasma turbulence which remain to be understood . as well as the questions mentioned in the above sections , one of the major unsolved problems",
    "is how the turbulent energy is finally transferred to the particles and dissipated , i.e. , how astrophysical plasmas , which are usually considered highly collisionless on the spatial and temporal scales of the turbulence , can be heated to the temperatures we observe .",
    "work has begun on this question , but it will likely be from future measurements and new space missions that this problem is finally solved . in this section , a selection of that recent work , and possible future directions , are discussed .",
    "one basic question is how dissipation is distributed throughout a turbulent plasma , i.e. , to what extent it is focussed at the energetic structures generated by intermittency .",
    "in fact , measuring the distribution of the dissipation can , in some sense , be considered a more direct way of measuring the intermittency of the cascade , since it is more directly connected to the energy cascade rate .",
    "@xcite measured the pdfs of the dissipation , averaged over different mhd - range scales , in both mhd simulations and the solar wind ( where a proxy based on magnetic field measurements was used ) .",
    "the pdfs were found to be well - fitted by log - normal distributions in all cases , although the higher - order moments of both the solar wind and simulated distributions were better described by log - poisson , rather than log - normal , scaling predictions .",
    "the rate at which these pdfs broaden towards smaller scales indicates the level of intermittency , and this was found to be consistent between the solar wind and simulations , and indicative of significant intermittency of the energy dissipation .",
    "it is of interest to determine which types of structures this dissipation is focussed at , and whether these correspond to any well - known plasma phenomena .",
    "for example , reconnecting current sheets @xcite , alfvn vortices @xcite , double layers @xcite , and several others have been proposed .",
    "it remains to be determined which of these , if any , play a significant role in the dissipation of plasma turbulence .    a more fundamental , and even less well understood , question is the nature of the physical mechanisms which transfer energy from the electromagnetic turbulence to the particles and lead to the irreversible heating of the plasma .",
