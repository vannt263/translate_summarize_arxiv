    "numerous experiments  @xcite have by now examined the properties of @xmath5 spin chain antiferromagnets which posses the haldane gap  @xcite .",
    "more recently , these antiferromagnets have been placed in a strong magnetic field  @xcite , and found to display evidence of a zero temperature phase transition to a state with a non - zero ground state magnetization .",
    "theoretical studies  @xcite have also examined this transition at zero temperature , and developed a picture of it as the bose condensation of magnons with azimuthal spin @xmath6 .",
    "although this possibility has not been considered before , it is not difficult to see that the condensation of magnons in a finite field should occur in quantum - disordered antiferromagnets in any dimension @xmath0 ( provided , of course , the magnons continue to behave as bosons ) . in this paper",
    "we shall present a general theory , in dimensions @xmath7 , of the finite temperature properties of quantum antiferromagnets in the vicinity of such a field - induced quantum transition .",
    "we begin by elucidating the precise conditions under which our results apply .",
    "consider an antiferromagnet with a quantum disordered ground state .",
    "the hamiltonian must posses at least an axial symmetry _",
    "i.e. _ at least one component ( say @xmath8 ) of the total spin must commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "the lowest excitation with non - zero spin must be separated from the ground state by a gap , and behave like a quasiparticle with bosonic statistics .",
    "these conditions are clearly satisfied by haldane gap antiferromagnets in which the in - plane anisotropy can be neglected ( the compound nenp does have a rather small in - plane anisotropy  @xcite , and the restrictions this places on applying our results to on experiments in nenp will be discussed later ) . in @xmath2 ,",
    "the @xmath9 kagome heisenberg antiferromagnet  @xcite is probably the most accessible candidate upon which our results can be tested - it has been argued that the magnons in this system are bosons  @xcite .",
    "now place this antiferromagnet in a magnetic field pointing along the direction of axial symmetry .",
    "the eigenenergy , @xmath10 of single magnon ( boson ) quasiparticles with momentum @xmath11 in a field @xmath12 then takes the form : @xmath13 here @xmath14 is the magnon gap and @xmath15 is the quasiparticle mass , both determined in the zero field antiferromagnet . for the @xmath5 haldane gap chain , we have the azimuthal spin @xmath6 . in the kagome antiferromagnet ,",
    "the magnon excitations have been argued to be spinons  @xcite : we therefore expect @xmath16 .",
    "later , we will discuss how the field induced transition in the kagome antiferromagnet may offer a way of experimentally / numerically determining the value of @xmath17 .",
    "\\label{coherent}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the @xmath0-component spatial co - ordinate , @xmath25 is the matsubara time , the chemical potential @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a repulsive interaction of a short range @xmath28 .",
    "this field theory has a phase transition exactly at @xmath18 , @xmath29 which has been studied by fisher _ et .",
    "they identified the upper - critical dimension as @xmath2 , above which the interaction @xmath27 is irrelevant . for @xmath30 ,",
    "@xmath27 is relevant , but the exponents were nevertheless found to have trivial values : the dynamic exponent @xmath31 , the correlation length exponent @xmath32 , and the field anomalous dimension @xmath33 .",
    "the triviality of the exponents is partially related to the fact that the parameter tuning the system through the transition , @xmath34 , couples to a conserved quantity - the density of bosons ; any such transition  @xcite must have @xmath35 .",
    "the structure of the @xmath30 , finite-@xmath27 fixed point is thus very unusual : despite describing a non - trivial , interacting , critical field theory , the exponents associated with all the relevant directions away from this fixed point are trivial . in this paper",
    ", we shall show that the interactions are crucial in determining the finite temperature properties of the bose gas near this fixed point .",
    "the fixed - point interactions are needed to preserve hyperscaling for @xmath1 and lead to highly non - trivial scaling functions for the finite - temperature correlations .      for @xmath30 , the combination of the presence of hyperscaling , and the absence of any anomalous exponents in the leading critical behavior , leads to remarkably universal finite temperature properties .",
    "as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we may use finite - size scaling to deduce scaling forms away from @xmath29 , @xmath18 .",
    "however the absence of any anomalous dimensions ( @xmath31 , @xmath49 , @xmath32 ) means that the usual two scale - factor universality  @xcite is now reduced to a _ zero scale - factor universality .",
    "_ described more precisely in the following subsection .      in simple terms",
    ", this universality is just the statement that all response functions are universal functions of the _ bare _ coupling constants @xmath34 and @xmath15 .",
    "there are no non - universal amplitudes ; the usual case has two non - universal amplitudes , or scale - factors  @xcite .",
    "the universality can be stated more precisely in terms of the the boson green s function @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the ordering symbol in imaginary time @xmath25 .",
    "after fourier transformation as per @xmath52 this yields @xmath53 at the matsubara frequencies @xmath54 , from which the retarded green s function @xmath55 can be obtained by analytic continuation to real frequencies using @xmath56 the lehman spectral representation of the green s function implies that @xmath57 , but does not constrain @xmath58 to be an odd function of @xmath59 .",
    "our central result is the zero scale - factor universality of @xmath60 , which is equivalent to the scaling form @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a highly non - trivial , but completely universal complex - valued function ; naturally , @xmath62 is independent of the nature of the boson - boson repulsion .",
    "an important property of @xmath62 is that it is _ analytic at all finite , real , values of all three arguments . _",
    "similar scaling forms hold for other correlators of @xmath63 - a particularly instructive observable is the _ local _ green s function , @xmath64 @xmath65 if we take the imaginary part of this equation , it is expected that the resulting on - shell contributions on the right - hand - side will occur only at small momenta ( determined by the frequency @xmath59 ) , and the momentum integral is ultraviolet convergent .",
    "we may therefore deduce from ( [ scalegr ] ) the scaling form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a fully universal , dimensionless , positive function .",
    "it is quite instructive to consider the limiting behavior of @xmath67 for small and large frequencies .",
    "we expect that @xmath68 should be analytic at @xmath69 at any finite @xmath70 ; this combined with the positivity condition on the spectral weight noted above , implies @xmath71 for small @xmath59 at finite @xmath70 .",
    "therefore , from ( [ deff ] ) the scaling function , @xmath67 , must satisfy @xmath72 , and @xmath73 ) ; the coefficient of the @xmath74 term is quite difficult to determine , and will be obtained in this paper only in a special limit . for large @xmath59 , or short times , @xmath60 should display essentially free particle behavior , as the dilute bosons have not had enough time to interact with each other . using the free boson spectral weight",
    "we can deduce that @xmath75    let us conclude this subsection by noting the precise conditions under which the system is in the critical region and ( [ scalegr ] ) and ( [ deff ] ) are valid .",
    "we must have @xmath76 further the measurement wavevectors must satisfy @xmath77    in @xmath2 the zero - scale - factor universality is violated by a logarithmic dependence on the microscopic interactions .",
    "furthermore , the scaling function @xmath62 will have a singularity associated with the finite temperature kosterlitz - thouless transition .",
    "zero scale - factor universality does not hold for @xmath78 .",
    "the dynamic information contained in @xmath58 is directly observable in neutron scattering experiments . in appendix  [ shankar ]",
    "we discuss the relationship between the correlators of @xmath63 and antiferromagnetic correlations measured by the neutrons ; this discussion is limited to the case where the quantum disordered phase has confined spinons _ i.e. _ @xmath6 , as in haldane gap antiferromagnets .",
    "the relationship for the case of deconfined spinons ( @xmath16 ) is quite different  @xcite and will not be considered in this paper explicitly .    in the following",
    ", @xmath79 will measure the energy _ lost _ by the neutrons in their interaction with the antiferromagnet .",
    "consider first a scattering even in which the antiferromagnet undergoes a @xmath80 transition .",
    "then , from the discussion in appendix  [ shankar ] and the fluctuation - dissipation theorem we may conclude that ( for the scattering cross - section is given by the dynamic structure factor @xmath81 where @xmath82 where @xmath36 is a _ non - universal _ quasi - particle renormalization factor between the magnon operators and the ones that couple to the neutrons .",
    "( the wavevector @xmath11 on the left - hand - side is measured from the antiferromagnetic ordering wavevector ) the scaling result for @xmath83 thus follows directly from ( [ scalegr ] ) .",
    "next , consider scattering with @xmath84 for the antiferromagnet .",
    "the associated dynamic structure factor is then @xmath85 which is @xmath86    by not resolving the energy of the scattered neutron , it is also possible to measure equal - time correlations embodied in the static structure factors .",
    "however the scaling properties of these observables are subtle , and require more careful interpretation . by performing a weighted frequency integral over the scaling limit of @xmath60 , we are implicitly only sensitive to frequencies much smaller than a high frequency cutoff like @xmath87 .",
    "thus in the following , our equal - time structure factors actually refer to scattering experiments in which energy transfers greater than @xmath87 are not integrated over . not blocking out these events ,",
    "will produce a background structure factor which may ( as in the haldane gap region defined below ) overwhelm the universal part of the static structure factor which is considered here . keeping this caveat in mind ,",
    "we define the structure factor @xmath88 @xmath89 where the result is not sensitive to the precise locations of the limits .",
    "the correlator @xmath90 can be defined analogously . from ( [ chipm ] ) and ( [ scalegr ] ) we can deduce the scaling result @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a universal scaling function determined completely by @xmath62 ( similarly for @xmath93 ) . finally , using the fact that @xmath63 and @xmath94 are canonically conjugate fields , it possible to deduce a frequency sum - rule on @xmath95 which leads to @xmath96 where we will henceforth use @xmath97 .",
    "we reiterate that all of the above results in this subsection refer only to the case of antiferromagnets with confined spinons .",
    "a second useful set of observables are those associated with magnetic fluctuations around @xmath98 .",
    "the uniform magnetization is a conserved quantity and , as a result , the quasi - particle renormalization factor @xmath36 does not appear in their scaling forms .",
    "the simplest of these is mean - value of the magnetization density @xmath99 itself , which is of course related to magnon density by @xmath100 this relationship , and the considerations of this subsection , apply to both confined ( @xmath101 ) and deconfined ( @xmath102 ) spinons .",
    "the mean - value of the magnetization is therefore @xmath103 and obeys the scaling form @xmath104 where the function @xmath105 is again dependent only on @xmath106 .",
    "the result ( [ magt0 ] ) follows from ( [ defb2 ] ) .",
    "the above discussion shows that the scaling functions of a large number of experimental observables can be obtained directly from the primary scaling function @xmath62 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is therefore devoted primarily to describing @xmath62 and associated scaling functions in different parameter regimes .",
    "it is convenient to discuss the properties of @xmath62 separately in three distinct regimes , which are analogous to those found by chakravarty _ et .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath2 @xmath107 sigma model .",
    "these regimes are illustrated in the phase diagrams in figs  [ figd1 ] ( @xmath4 ) and  [ figd2 ] ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "the crossover boundaries between the regimes are delineated by the value of the dimensionless ratio @xmath108 ( upto logarithmic terms in @xmath2 ) .",
    "we consider the three cases separately      this is the analog of the quantum - disordered regime of refs  @xcite .",
    "only a dilute gas of thermally - excited bosons is present , and their mutual interactions are weak .",
    "properties of the quantum antiferromagnet can be described by a low - magnon - density expansion about the quantum disordered ground state . in @xmath4",
    ", we identify this as the haldane - gap regime in fig  [ figd1 ] .",
    "this is the quantum - critical regime , in which @xmath31 critical fluctuations are quenched in a universal way by the temperature .",
    "the value @xmath111 is the dominant energy scale and universally determines everything : the boson density , spectrum , and interactions .",
    "the only small parameter which may be used to determine scaling functions is @xmath112 . as we will see , this is not particularly effective in @xmath4 where , fortunately , exact methods are available .",
    "it is instructive to consider the physics of this region as a function of the measurement frequency @xmath59 ( see fig  [ omega ] ) . at large frequencies , @xmath113 , or short times ,",
    "the effects finite temperature have not yet become manifest , and the system displays the physics of the @xmath114 critical field theory i.e. it is a dilute gas of bosonic quasiparticles with repulsive interactions . as one lowers the frequency through @xmath115 there is a crossover to a novel @xmath31 , quantum - relaxational regime ( fig  [ omega ] ) .",
    "now each boson interacts strongly with thermally excited partners , leading to strong dissipation and overdamped quasiparticles .",
    "the behavior in @xmath4 and @xmath2 is quite different and we will therefore consider the two cases separately .    in @xmath4 ,",
    "the ground state is a luttinger liquid , which is itself a critical phase with @xmath117 ( fig  [ figd1 ] ) .",
    "again , consider the physics as a function of @xmath59 ( fig  [ omega ] ) . for sufficiently large @xmath59 ( @xmath118 )",
    "we have the dilute bose gas physics of the @xmath114 critical point , similar to that discussed above for the quantum - critical region . at smaller @xmath59",
    ", there is a crossover ( near @xmath119 ) to a luttinger liquid - like region where we may as well assume that @xmath18 .",
    "however at small enough frequencies , @xmath120 , the effects of a finite temperature finally become apparent .",
    "the massless modes of the luttinger liquid are then quenched into a @xmath117 quantum - relaxational regime , rather similar to the @xmath31 quantum relaxational regime discussed above .",
    "this last crossover is , strictly speaking , a property of the @xmath117 critical point on the luttinger liquid fixed line determined by the value of @xmath34 , and not a property of the @xmath31 critical end - point at @xmath114 .",
    "it is thus described by a reduced luttinger liquid scaling function @xmath121 .",
    "we will obtain exact results for @xmath121 using an argument based on conformal invariance .",
    "we will also discuss an important compatibility condition between the scaling functions @xmath62 and @xmath121 , and show how the more general @xmath62 collapses into the small @xmath34 limit of @xmath121 .    in @xmath2 , ( fig  [ figd2 ] )",
    "the ground state is a boson superfluid , which survives at finite temperature .",
    "there is a kosterlitz - thouless phase transition at a finite @xmath70 , which has been studied in some detail earlier  @xcite . in the superfluid phase",
    "therefore , one has a large frequency dilute bose gas behavior crossing over to a small frequency goldstone phase with quasi - long - range order ( fig  [ omega ] ) .",
    "the outline of the rest of the paper is as follows .",
    "we will begin , in section  [ rganal ] , by a renormalization group analysis of the partition function @xmath36 .",
    "this will allow us to demonstrate the logarithmic corrections to scaling in @xmath2 and obtain the leading terms of the in a @xmath3 expansion .",
    "these leading terms are consistent with the zero scale - factor universality .",
    "we will then , in section  [ onedimension ] , turn to a discussion of the exact properties of @xmath62 and @xmath121 in @xmath4 .",
    "a brief summary and a discussion of relevance to experiments appear in section  [ conc ] .",
    "three appendixes contain discussions of some peripheral points .",
    "the momentum shell renormalization group equations for @xmath36 have already been obtained by fisher and hohenberg  @xcite . however their analysis of the equations was restricted to @xmath2 , @xmath122 , and temperatures at or below the kosterlitz thouless transition . in this section",
    "we will extend this analysis to cover the remaining regions in @xmath2 ( fig  [ figd2 ] ) , and to dimensions @xmath123 in an @xmath3 expansion ( fig  [ figd1 ] ) .",
    "the analysis  @xcite proceeds by introducing an upper cutoff , @xmath124 in momentum space , and replacing @xmath27 by a contact interaction @xmath125 .",
    "degrees of freedom in a shell between @xmath124 and @xmath126 are integrated out , followed by a rescaling of co - ordinates and field variables @xmath127 note that the there is no anomalous dimension in the rescaling factor for @xmath63 as @xmath49 .",
    "further , the scaling dimension of @xmath128 is exactly @xmath0 , as it must be for any conserved charge density  @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to consider the cases @xmath18 and @xmath129 separately :      the renormalization group equations are  @xcite @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 is the surface area of a unit sphere in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we integrate these equations to a scale @xmath133 where the system is non - critical _ i.e. _ when @xmath134 where @xmath135 is significantly smaller than unity , but not so small that the system is still critical . for @xmath122 , the magnetization , @xmath99 , and the boson density @xmath136",
    "are then given by @xmath137 for @xmath30 , and @xmath138 small , @xmath139 approaches its fixed point value @xmath140 inserting this fixed - point value and the dependence of @xmath141 on the initial value of @xmath34 into ( [ mrg ] ) we find to lowest order in @xmath142 that @xmath42 indeed has the form ( [ magt0 ] ) with the universal number @xmath44 given by @xmath143    in @xmath2 , @xmath139 approaches 0 logarithmically slowly . for large @xmath144 we have @xmath145 inserting this into ( [ mrg ] ) we find  @xcite @xmath146 note the logarithmic violation of the perfect scaling of ( [ magt0 ] )",
    ".      we will restrict our analysis to the center of the quantum critical region in @xmath2 ( fig  [ figd2 ] ) and @xmath123 ( fig  [ figd1 ] ) : the initial value of @xmath34 will therefore be fixed at @xmath148 and the initial value of the temperature @xmath70 will be close to 0",
    ". we will only need the finite @xmath70 renormalization group equations for @xmath34 and @xmath70 which are  @xcite @xmath149 to leading order in @xmath142 ( leading - logs ) it is sufficient to assume that for @xmath30 ( @xmath2 ) @xmath139 is given by eqn ( [ ufixed ] ) ( eqn ( [ ud2 ] ) ) .",
    "we will now integrate the renormalization group equations until a scale @xmath141 where @xmath150 the correlation length @xmath151 is then given by @xmath152 while the boson density is @xmath153 in the last step we have anticipated that to leading order in @xmath142 it is sufficient to evaluate the integral directly in @xmath2 .",
    "let us now examine the results of integrating ( [ rgt ] ) for @xmath154 . to",

    "we have so far determined that for small @xmath3 the @xmath114 critical field theory has a contact interaction of strength @xmath166 , and all other two / multi - particle interactions can be neglected .",
    "remarkably , following haldane  @xcite , it also possible to determine the exact critical field theory for @xmath167 or @xmath4 .",
    "the critical field theory then has @xmath168 ( the bosons are thus impenetrable ) . moreover",
    ", all other boson interactions continue to be irrelevant . in appendix",
    "[ canonical ] we consider a one - dimensional bose gas in the vicinity of this strong - coupling fixed point and demonstrate this explicitly .",
    "the methods of appendix  [ canonical ] and earlier works  @xcite use the well - known equivalence between the @xmath4 impenetrable bose gas and free fermions .",
    "the field theory of the critical end - point at @xmath114 is therefore given by the free fermion hamiltonian @xmath169 where @xmath170 are canonical fermion fields .",
    "correlators of this theory can only depend upon @xmath15 , @xmath34 , and @xmath70 , and the zero scale - factor universality is therefore manifest .",
    "the scaling limit of the correlators of the uniform magnetization can now be obtained almost trivially : the uniform magnetization density just measures the number of particles and its correlators are therefore the same as those of @xmath171 .",
    "in particular we have for the scaling function for the uniform magnetization in ( [ defb2 ] ) @xmath172 where @xmath173 .",
    "this scaling function has the limiting value @xmath174 as @xmath175 in the haldane gap region , and @xmath176 as @xmath177 in the luttinger liquid region ( fig  [ figd1 ] ) .",
    "this last result combines with ( [ defb2 ] ) to yield ( [ magt0 ] ) with @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "observables associated with correlations of the staggered magnetization , like @xmath58 , are much more difficult to obtain - it is necessary to express the impenetrable bose fields in terms of the fermi fields by a continuum jordan - wigner transformation  @xcite and then evaluate the correlator - a naive wick s theorem expansion of this correlator will yield an infinite number of terms .",
    "recently , korepin and slavnov  @xcite , following earlier work of lenard  @xcite , have succeeded in resumming this expansion and showing that all space - time dependent , finite temperature , correlators of the impenetrable bose gas can be expressed in terms of the solution and fredholm determinant of a linear fredholm integral equation",
    ". thus determination of the universal scaling function @xmath62 in @xmath4 has been reduced to the problem of solving completely an integral equation , and taking the fourier transform of the result .",
    "analytic methods can take us no further , and it is necessary to resort to numerical analysis of the integral equations .",
    "we have begun such a numerical program , and have so far obtained essentially exact results for the equal - time correlations - these are described below in section  [ eqtime ] .",
    "it should be possible to extend our results to obtain local , time - dependent correlations ( and hence the scaling function @xmath67 in ( [ deff ] ) ) but we have not yet done so .",
    "a general picture of the form of @xmath67 can be obtained from the asymptotic limits quoted in section  [ introzerosc ] ; should it become experimentally useful to obtain more precise numerical results for @xmath67 , we shall be happy to provide them .",
    "we also note that , recently , korepin and collaborators  @xcite have succeeding in determining exact results for certain asymptotic properties of @xmath58 by applying the quantum - inverse scattering method to the integral equations noted above . for the equal - time @xmath58 they obtained results for the leading and next - to - leading terms as @xmath178 , while for unequal time correlators , both @xmath24 and @xmath25 were sent to @xmath179 .",
    "unfortunately , these asymptotic results are not very useful in determining experimental observables which require fourier transformation to functions of momenta and frequency ( the large @xmath24 behavior of a function implies little about the small @xmath11 limit of its fourier transform ) .",
    "simply fourier transforming the asymptotic terms leads to results which compare very poorly with the exact results which we obtained by the alternative means described below .",
    "we comment on some features of these exact asymptotic results in appendix  [ itsetal ] .    in section  [ lutliq ] we will consider the limit @xmath116 where it is possible to make much greater analytic progress in determining the scaling functions .",
    "as we have already noted , the lower frequency properties in this region are described by luttinger liquid criticality , and it possible to use conformal invariance arguments to obtain closed - from results .",
    "the most convenient procedure for determining equal - time correlations begins with lenard s  @xcite result for the density matrix of the impenetrable bose gas , which is tantamount to a formal solution of the integral equation of ref  @xcite .",
    "his result can be written as  @xcite @xmath180 where the operator @xmath181 acts on the real axis between 0 and @xmath24 , and has the matrix elements @xmath182 _ i.e. _ the fermion green s function .",
    "the form ( [ lenard ] ) is amenable to rapid numerical evaluation .",
    "we discretize the real line between 0 and @xmath24 into @xmath183 points , whence the operators in ( [ lenard ] ) become @xmath184 toeplitz matrices",

    "some readers may have trouble reconciling this with the fact that fermion - fermion correlation functions fall as @xmath217 in free - field theory .",

    "we now consider the correlations at finite temperatures .",
    "in general the passage from zero to nonzero temperatures is nontrivial since in the latter case non only the ground state but excited state correlations enter .",
    "however in two euclidean dimensions , in a relativistically invariant theory such as this one , we have the remarkable result from conformal field theory that was first pointed out by cardy  @xcite . using the conformal mapping between the infinite - plane and the strip of finite - length @xmath226 along the imaginary - time direction",

    "there are two ways to proceed .",

    "the general principles we learn about analytic continuation into the complex plane are usually illustrated with trivial examples ( i.e. , noninteracting propagators ) and here we have one of the few nontrivial and hence instructive cases .",
    "the second approach is peculiar to this problem and relevant because conformal invariance methods always give the correlations in coordinate and not momentum space .",
    "thus one can continue the results from imaginary to real time first and then take the transform .",
    "that calculation may be found in section 3.3 of ref  @xcite and has its own pedagogical value .",
    "returning to the first approach , we used the identity @xmath253 to put the @xmath254 and @xmath255 terms in ( [ cardy ] ) up in the exponent .",
    "the @xmath24 and @xmath25 integrals were then analytically performed , followed finally by the @xmath256 integration . after using ( [ scalelut ] )",
    ", the final result gave us values of the scaling function @xmath121 at the matsubara frequencies along the imaginary frequency axis .",
    "we found @xmath257 this result was obtained earlier by schulz  @xcite and shankar  @xcite in a different context but not analyzed in any detail .",
    "first , the above function @xmath258 specifies our knowledge at positive and negative matsubara points . our goal is to construct the physical real frequency correlation function and its singularity structure from it .",
    "as it stands , @xmath121 can only be used for numerical purposes and not for studying analytic structure since @xmath259 is neither analytic nor anti - analytic . in other words",
    "we can use @xmath121 to calculate values of the putative function at the matsubara points .",
    "the mod symbol tells us that the function we are seeking has the same value at any postive matsubara point and its negated image .",
    "now , on the real frequency axis we have a retarded correlation function , which we assume is well defined .",
    "since the factor @xmath260 converges in the upper half - plane ( uhp ) the function on the real axis has an analytic extension to the uhp which is free of singularities .",
    "its values at the matsubara points @xmath261 , with @xmath42 an integer are given by @xmath121 .",
    "such a function is readily found : simply drop the mod symbol on @xmath248 in the formula for @xmath121 .",
    "let us call the function ( with the mod symbol dropped ) @xmath262.this @xmath263 is the unique analytic function ( with good behaviour in the uhp ) determined by our knowledge at postive matsubara frequencies .",
    "being an analytic function it has a continuation to the lower half - plane ( lhp ) which is however not guaranteed to be free of singularities or to have anything to do with the original problem .",
    "in particular the poles that the @xmath264 functions have in the lhp are not germane to the physical response function .",
    "in fact this continuation to the lhp of @xmath262 does not even agree with the data we have in eqn.([resal ] ) for negative matsubara points : since @xmath265 it is not invariant under the change of sign of frequency as the given data are .",
    "however , there is an analytic function which will duplicate the given data in the lhp : it is obtained by replacing @xmath266 by @xmath267 in eqn.([resal ] ) .",
    "such a function , @xmath268 , satisifes @xmath269 this function will agree with @xmath270 of eqn.([resal ] ) at points with negative matsubara frequencies and be free of singularities in the lhp .",
    "however its poles in the uhp have no physical significance .",
    "thus the function at real frequencies is the limit of two different functions as we approach the real axis from above or below . _",
    "the true singularities of the physical response function are due to the mismatch of these two functions and not due to the poles they have in regions where they no longer represent the physical function or a continuation of it .",
    "_ so we must consider the difference between these two functions @xmath263 and @xmath271 on the real frequency axis .",
    "it is readily shown that the two functions are conjugates of each other there so that the discontinuity is just twice the imaginary part .",
    "the physical response function s real singularity is therefore a cut and not poles .",
    "this is reasonable since a theory with gapless excitations on top of the ground state ( and hence a cut at zero temperature ) can not lose its spectral weight in these regions by the inclusion of higher states in the thermal average at finite temperatures .",
    "( the converse is possible : a cut free region on the real axis at @xmath18 can close up at @xmath272 . )    in fig  [ luta ] we plot @xmath273 as a function of @xmath248 and at a representative set of values of @xmath274 .",
    "notice that for large @xmath274 there is a well defined peak at @xmath275 : this is a signature of the propagating modes in the luttinger liquid ground state and represents the behavior of the intermediate region @xmath276 in fig  [ omega ] . at smaller values of @xmath274 notice that the peak in fig  [ luta ] remains at @xmath277 .",
    "this is the @xmath117 quantum relaxational behavior ( fig  [ omega ] ) where the strong interaction between the thermally excited luttinger modes has left only overdamped excitations .",

    ", we can deduce that , provided @xmath278 , this observable satisfies the scaling form @xmath279 where @xmath280 is a universal function , specified completely by the function @xmath121 in ( [ defloc ] ) .",
    "moreover , as the luttinger - liquid criticality has a particle - hole symmetry , @xmath281 must be an even , positive function of @xmath248 .",
    "as already noted , we expect on general grounds that @xmath71 for small @xmath59 at finite @xmath70 : therefore @xmath282 at small @xmath248 .",
    "we also note that for @xmath283 the _ real _ part of the local green s function will not satisfy an analogous because the integral in ( [ defloc ] ) is then dominated by large momentum contributions .",
    "there is again a compatibility condition between the luttinger liquid scaling function @xmath280 and the scaling function @xmath67 in ( [ deff ] ) quite analogous to that for @xmath121 , @xmath62 in ( [ acompat ] ) ; we have @xmath284 as before , the limits @xmath249 and @xmath285 do not commute , and the @xmath286 limit of the exact @xmath281 computed below will not agree with that of @xmath67 in ( [ freeparticles ] )    let us finally present the exact computation of @xmath281 .",

    "it is expected that the limits @xmath290 and @xmath177 _ do commute _",

    "<S> consider a @xmath0-dimensional antiferromagnet with a quantum disordered ground state and a gap to bosonic excitations with non - zero spin . in a finite external magnetic field , this antiferromagnet will undergo a phase transition to a ground state with non - zero magnetization , describable as the condensation of a dilute gas of bosons . </S>",
    "<S> the finite temperature properties of the bose gas in the vicinity of this transition are argued to obey a hypothesis of _ zero scale - factor universality _ for @xmath1 , with logarithmic violations in @xmath2 . scaling properties of various experimental observables </S>",
    "<S> are computed in an expansion in @xmath3 , and exactly in @xmath4 . </S>"
