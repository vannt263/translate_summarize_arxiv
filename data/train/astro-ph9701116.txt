    "the existence ( or lack ) of a significant population of normal disk galaxies at very high redshifts ( @xmath0 ) would have profound implications for models of structure formation and evolution in the early universe . while the damped ly@xmath1 ( dla ) systems seen in spectra of high - redshift quasars have been suggested to represent disk galaxies in their youth ( wolfe et al 1986 ) , direct evidence for such a hypothesis has been scarce ( see the discussion by lu et al 1996 ) .",
    "wolfe ( 1995 ) has suggested that the metal absorption lines associated with dla galaxies exhibit what was termed `` edge - leading '' asymmetric profiles , as expected from rotating gaseous structures",
    ". detailed analysis of a larger sample of dla systems appears to confirm this result ( prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) .",
    "the dla system at @xmath12 in the spectrum of the background quasar q 2233 + 1310 ( @xmath13 ) has a neutral hydrogen column density @xmath14(h i)@xmath15 atoms @xmath16 ( lu et al 1993 ) . very recently , djorgovski et al ( 1996 ) reported the detection of ly@xmath1 emission at @xmath17 only 2.3 \" away from the quasar .",
    "they argued that the ly@xmath1 emission most likely comes from the same galaxy that is also responsible for the dla absorption seen in the quasar spectrum .",
    "the separation between the galaxy and the quasar sightline implies a radius of at least 17 kpc ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) for the galaxy , comparable to the size of normal spiral disks .",
    "djorgovski et al suggested that the offset of @xmath18 km s@xmath4 between the redshift of the ly@xmath1 emission and that of the damped ly@xmath1 absorption may be due to galactic rotation , although no independent supporting evidence was available .",
    "the detection of the ly@xmath1 emission provides a measure of the systemic redshift of the absorbing galaxy .",
    "an examination of the metal absorption line profiles in relation to the systemic redshift may then reveal important kinematic information about the absorbing gas and hence the nature of the absorbing galaxy .",
    "motivated by this , we obtained an echelle spectrum of q 2233 + 1310 in july 1996 using the 10 m keck telescope and the hires spectrograph .",
    "details of the observations , data reductions , and full analysis of the dla system will be described elsewhere ( lu , sargent , & barlow 1997 , in preparation ) .",
    "here we only discuss the results relevant to the galactic rotation hypothesis .",
    "figure 1 shows the profiles of selected low - ionization metal absorption lines from the dla absorber , as well as those of the high - ionization c iv and si iv lines .",
    "djorgovski et al ( 1996 ) gave a redshift for the ly@xmath1 emission of @xmath19 , which we adopt as the systemic redshift of the absorbing galaxy photons and hence the profile of the ly@xmath1 emission .",
    "however , unless the processes are very asymmetric with respect to the rest - frame velocity of the galaxy , the systemic redshift as inferred from the ly@xmath1 emission should be largely unaffected . ] .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , although the measurement uncertainty in the redshift of the ly@xmath1 emission is only @xmath20 or @xmath21 km s@xmath4 , the systematic error could be significantly larger because the blue wing of the ly@xmath1 emission may be absorbed by ly@xmath1 forest clouds at lower redshifts .",
    "indeed , the blue side of the ly@xmath1 emission profile appears much steeper than the red side ( see figure 3 of djorgovski et al 1996 ) , making the above a valid concern .",
    "hence the true systemic redshift of the absorbing galaxy is probably somewhat less than the quoted value of @xmath22 .",
    "the main purpose of this study is to examine the kinematics of the absorbing gas as revealed by the metal absorption lines to see if there is any evidence for galactic rotation .",
    "the idea behind such an analysis was first discussed by lanzetta & bowen ( 1992 ) and then by wolfe ( 1995 ) and prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 ) .",
    "here we describe the basic ideas but refer the readers to prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 ) for details .",
    "take the simplest case where the quasar sightline passes through a galactic disk edge - on but off the center of the galaxy .",
    "the galaxy is assumed to have a finite thickness and a flat rotation curve beyond the innermost region .",
    "further assume that the distribution of the gas in the disk is such that the density of the gas decreases with galactocentric radius as well as with the distance away from the galactic midplane .",
    "then the point of closest impact to the galactic center along the quasar sightline should have the strongest absorption , and also the largest projected velocity from the rotation .",
    "conversely , the points along the quasar sightline that are further away from the galactic center will have less absorption and smaller projected velocities ( see figure 3 of prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) .",
    "the result is that the strongest absorption ( which is associated with the closest point of impact in this example ) should occur at either the blue or the red edge of the absorption profile ( depending on the direction of the galactic rotation ) , and that the strength of the absorption should decrease smoothly toward the opposing edge .",
    "such profiles were termed `` edge - leading asymmetric '' by prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 ) .",
    "more general considerations with realistic disk models and sightline orientations are discussed by prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 ) , but the edge - leading asymmetry is generally preserved . replacing the smooth gas distribution with discrete cloud distribution does not change the qualitative picture , although the random nature of the cloud distribution means that edge - leading asymmetric profiles may not be apparent in every single case .    in the case of q 2233 + 1310 ,",
    "the metal absorption line profiles are clearly asymmetric , with the strongest absorption component occurs near the blue edge and with the strength of the components decreases smoothly toward the red edge , as is best illustrated by the fe ii @xmath231608 profile in figure 11302 shown in figure 1 ) are less suited for this purpose because ( 1 ) the information on the velocity structure of the absorption is often lost in the saturated parts , and ( 2 ) strong absorption lines are more sensitive to trace amounts of gas so they are more easily contaminated by diffuse clouds ( e.g. , halo clouds ) that are not associated with the galactic disk .",
    "absorption lines of high ionization species ( e.g. , si iv , c iv ) are not suited for this purpose either because they are not expected to trace the bulk of neutral gas in galactic disks . ] .",
    "these are characteristic of profiles caused by rotating disk - like structures .",
    "figure 3 of djorgovski et al ( 1996 ) shows that the absorbing galaxy is clearly at a slightly higher redshift than the damped ly@xmath1 absorption itself .",
    "this means that the dominant h i absorbing gas along the quasar sightline must be moving toward us . under the galactic rotation hypothesis",
    ", this means that the projected rotation velocity of the galaxy along the quasar sightline must be pointing toward us .",
    "consequently , the metal line profiles in the q 2233 + 1310 dla system can be understood if the absorbing galaxy is a rotating disk and if the quasar line of sight intersects the midplane of the disk near the major axis .",
    "the galactic rotation hypothesis then predicts that the velocity spread in the absorption components should be comparable to or smaller than the maximum projected rotation velocity along the quasar sightline . for the q 2233 + 1310 system , the components in the fe ii absorption has a total velocity spread of @xmath24 km s@xmath4 , which , due to projection effects , should be a lower limit to the true rotation velocity .",
    "the galactic rotation hypothesis also predicts that the strongest absorption component should be at the velocity corresponding to the maximum projected velocity along the quasar line of sight ( relative to the systemic velocity of the galaxy ) .",
    "this would indicate that the maximum projected rotation velocity of the galaxy is @xmath25 km s@xmath4 based on fe ii@xmath231608 in figure 1 .",
    "part of the difference between this velocity and the projected velocity of @xmath26 km s@xmath4 inferred from the velocity spread of the absorption components may be due to a small systematic error in the systemic redshift of the absorbing galaxy caused by absorption from foreground ly@xmath1 forest clouds ( see discussion at the beginning of the section ) .    in summary , the edge - leading asymmetry seen in the metal absorption lines and the total velocity spread of the components in the q 2233 + 1310 dla system are entirely consistent with the hypothesis ( djorgovski et al 1996 ) that the absorbing galaxy is rotating with a circular velocity of @xmath27 km s@xmath4 .",
    "in fact , these pieces of evidence may be taken as support for the galactic rotation hypothesis because , if the absorbing clouds were moving randomly , there is no _ a priori _ reason why ( 1 ) the strongest absorption component should be at the blue edge of the absorbing complex and why the strength of the absorption components should decrease smoothly toward increasing velocity , ( 2 ) the total velocity spread among the components should be similar to that inferred from the position of the strongest absorption component .",
    "gas clouds moving in predominantly radial orbits are expected to produce absorption profiles that are symmetric with respect to the systemic velocity of the absorbing galaxy with absorption peaks occurring at both the blue and red edges of the profiles ( lanzetta & bowen 1992 ; prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) , contrary to what is observed here .",
    "a potential problem with the galactic disk interpretation for the q 2233 + 1310 dla system is the large velocity spread of the absorbing components : @xmath28 km s@xmath4 .",
    "monte carlo simulations by prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 ) indicate that , for given rotation velocity and inclination angle , @xmath29 decreases with increasing impact parameter .",
    "the large observed @xmath29 for the q 2233 + 1310 system requires the absorbing galaxy to have a very large disk ( with an exponential disk scale length comparable to the impact parameter@xmath3017 kpc ) and to be viewed nearly edge - on .",
    "spiral disks with such large scale length do exist but are quite rare in the local universe ( cf .",
    "grosbol 1985 ; kent 1985 ; note the different choices of hubble constant in these studies ) .",
    "however , the technique of damped ly@xmath1 absorption may preferentially pick out large galaxies owing to their large absorption cross sections .",
    "the requirement on the scale length may be relaxed if some of the velocity spread is due to non - circular motions ( eg , random motions ) of the clouds . in any case , it may be possible to test these predictions with deep imaging observations .",
    "the width of the ly@xmath1 emission profile from the q 2233 + 1310 dla absorber provides a consistency check of the disk interpretation .",
    "the ly@xmath1 emission line has an apparent width of fwhm@xmath31 km s@xmath4 ( see figure 3 of djorgovski et al 1996 ) , which , due to possible absorption of the blue wing by ly@xmath1 forest clouds , is likely to be a lower limit to the true width . the expected width of the line is @xmath32 sin@xmath33 if it is broadened by galactic rotation , where @xmath33 is the inclination angle .",
    "this implies a projected rotation velocity along the quasar sightline of @xmath34 km s@xmath4 , which is consistent with earlier estimates .",
    "if indeed the absorbing galaxy is a rotating disk , one can estimate the total dynamic mass of the galaxy .",
    "as argued above , the rotation velocity of the galaxy is probably 200 km s@xmath4 or more .",
    "the corresponding dynamic mass is then @xmath35 for @xmath36 kpc , consistent with the djorgovski et al estimate .      is the dla absorber at @xmath12 toward q 2233 + 1310 unusual as compared to other dla absorbers ?",
    "other than the fact that it is one of the two dla systems for which ly@xmath1 emission from the absorbers has been reported ( see next section for the discussion of the only other case ) , we are not aware of any peculiarity about this system . based on a preliminary analysis of the metal absorption lines , we estimate that this dla galaxy has a metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath37 , very similar to other dla galaxies between @xmath38 ( cf , pettini et al 1994 ; lu et al 1996 ) .",
    "the relative abundances of n , o , al , si , s , and fe also appear similar to those studied by lu et al ( 1996 ) .",
    "in all respects , this appears to be just an average dla system .",
    "the comparison of the absorption profiles between the low ionization species and the high ionization species is particularly informative . over the velocity range @xmath39 km s@xmath4 where the strongest low ionization absorption occurs ,",
    "the high ion absorption lines are very weak , indicating that the gas at these velocities must be substantially neutral .",
    "the strongest c iv and si iv absorption occurs at @xmath40 km s@xmath4 , where the low ion absorption is essentially absent .",
    "in fact , one can almost make the case that the high ion absorption appears to avoid the low ion absorption in terms of the positions of the absorption components ( figure 1 ) . in general ,",
    "the high ion absorption line profiles show no similarity to those of the low ionization species in dla galaxies ( wolfe et al 1994 ; prochaska & wolfe 1996 ; lu et al 1996 ) , suggesting that the bulk of high ion gas may arise from regions physically unrelated to the low ion gas .",
    "the q 2233 + 1310 dla system evidently fits in that pattern . because the high ion absorption extends to as large negative velocity as the low ion lines , it is possible that the weak high ion absorption at @xmath41 km s@xmath4 arises from the disk (",
    "although probably not co - spatial with the bulk of low ion gas in the disk ) so they are also spread out by galactic rotation .",
    "the strong high ion absorption component at @xmath40 km s@xmath4 is possibly associated with a halo cloud outside the disk .",
    "the technique used here to infer the kinematics of the absorbing galaxy is applicable only when the systemic redshift of the absorbing galaxy is known .",
    "the only other case reported in the literature of the detection of ly@xmath1 emission from a dla system is by warren & moller ( 1996 ) for the @xmath42 system toward q 0528@xmath112505 . in this case , three ly@xmath1 emitters ( dubbed s1 , s2 , and s3 by the original authors ) are reported with @xmath432.8136 , 2.8097 , and 2.8126 and with separations from the quasar line of sight 1.22 `` ( 9 kpc ) , 11.8 '' ( 88 kpc ) , and 20.6 \" ( 154 kpc ) , respectively , for @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "warren & moller argued that s1 is the most likely candidate for the actual absorber because of its closeness to the quasar sightline .",
    "figure 2 shows the absorption profiles of selected metal lines in the system ( detailed analysis of this dla system was given in lu et al 1996 ) .",
    "the velocities are relative to the rest frame of s1 .",
    "the velocities corresponding to the redshifts of s2 and s3 are also indicated . in this case , no clear signature of galactic rotation is noticeable in the absorption line profiles .",
    "the absorption profiles ( e.g. , s ii@xmath231253 ) appear to show edge - leading asymmetry , but the velocity of s1 does not line up with either edge of the profile .",
    "in addition , the velocity spread of the absorption components is so large ( @xmath44 km s@xmath4 ) that it seems unlikely that a single galaxy is responsible for the absorption .",
    "the redshift of the dla absorption ( @xmath42 ) is , in fact , slightly higher than the emission redshift of the background quasar itself ( @xmath45 ) , which makes it likely that the absorbing galaxy is within the same cluster of galaxies as the quasar itself2505 is a radio - loud quasar , and there is strong evidence that radio - loud quasars tend to live in rich clusters of galaxies ( cf .",
    "yee & green 1987 ) . ] .",
    "the three individual ly@xmath1 emitters may then plausibly be interpreted as either individual galaxies in the cluster center or subgalactic fragments that are still in the process of assembly ( warren & moller 1996 ) .",
    "the large velocity spread of the metal lines may be explained if the sightline samples more than one galaxy or subgalactic fragment .",
    "by comparing the observed metal absorption line profiles with simulated model profiles , prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 ) find strong statistical evidence that dla absorbers at @xmath46 are rotating disks with a most likely circular velocity @xmath47 km s@xmath4 .",
    "the technique discussed here presents a way to test independently the hypothesis that dla absorbers are young disk galaxies .",
    "the analysis of prochaska & wolfe ( 1997 ) has the virtue of a large sample size , but the results are only statistical .",
    "the technique presented here allows for the test of the galactic rotation hypothesis for individual cases , but is only applicable when the systemic redshift of the absorber is known .",
    "the two techniques should complement each other well in revealing the nature of dla absorbers at @xmath0 , when it becomes extremely difficult to determine the morphology of the absorbing galaxies using standard imaging techniques .",
    "the combination of rotation velocities as inferred from absorption line analysis with information on the impact parameters found from imaging studies allows for the estimate of the typical mass of the absorbing galaxies .",
    "such results should provide significant constraints on theories of structure formation in the early universe .",
    "the authors are grateful to art wolfe and jason x. prochaska for communicating their results on the galactic rotation analysis of damped ly@xmath1 systems in advance of publication , and for stimulating discussion on the subject .",
    "we also thank george djorgovski and chuck steidel for useful comments on the manuscript .",
