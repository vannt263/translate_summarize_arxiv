    "roughly speaking , gravitational scattering will be defined as the study of few - body encounters in which particles interact by newtonian gravity , with certain types of initial conditions ; namely , a few ( normally two or three ) bound subsystems , such as single stars or binaries , approach from infinity . then the problem is to characterise the outcome , usually in a statistical sense .",
    "the new book by valtonen & karttunen ( 2006 ) will very quickly become the standard reference on this problem .",
    "while approximate analytical methods yield useful results in some limiting situations ( see , for example , sec.[sec : adiabatic ] ) , computer simulation is an essential tool . and while efficient codes exist for computing individual scattering encounters ( e.g. _ triple_sverre / web / pages / nbody.htm ] , _",
    "fewbody_fregeau / code / fewbody/ ] ) the scattering packages in _",
    "starlab_starlab/ ] provide the additional , extremely valuable functionality of efficiently sampling parameter space .",
    "many possibilities exist for graphic rendering of individual encounters , such as _ glanim_makino / softwares / glanim/ ] .",
    "though the topic was developed throughout the twentieth century , it remains topical , because of fresh applications , such as the following .      as a result of mergers ,",
    "central binary black holes are expected in many galaxies .",
    "observationally , binary black holes are studied at high energies ( e.g. ngc 6240 , studied with chandra : komossa et al 2003 ) and at visual wavelengths ( e.g. the famous tuorla object oj287 : sillanpaa et al 1988 ) .",
    "a problem of long standing is the evolution of the relative orbit of the black holes , as they scatter stars from the surrounding galaxy ( hills 1983 , gould 1991b , mikkola & valtonen 1992 , fukushige et al 1992 , quinlan 1996 , zier & biermann 2001 , merritt 2001 , 2002 , yu & tremaine 2003 , milosavljevi & merritt 2003 , chatterjee et al 2003 , gualandris et al 2005 ) .      for the solar system , though it is not now in a star cluster , the question of stellar perturbations has been considered for a long time ( e.g. lyttleton & yabushita 1965 ) . in recent years",
    "this question has arisen because of the initially surprising absence of planets ( searched for photometrically ) in star clusters ( e.g. the globular star cluster 47 tuc ; see gilliland et al 2000 , weldrake et al 2005 ) . from the theoretical point of view",
    "the study of such scattering is simplified by the fact that one component of the participating binary is effectively massless ( davies & sigurdsson 2001 , spurzem et al 2003 , fregeau et al 2005 ) .",
    "we shall say more about this in sec.[sec : adiabatic ]      the idea here is that the flux caused by interactions with normal matter may be enhanced in situations where the particles can be trapped gravitationally , which allows them multiple opportunities of interacting .",
    "this is a more speculative problem , but has still attracted considerable interest ( press & spergel 1985 , gould 1987 , 1988 , 1991a , damour & krauss 1998 , 1999 , gould & alam 2001 , lundberg & edsj 2004 ) .",
    "theoretically it is the case where the incoming particle is nearly massless .",
    "the complexity of the problem is illustrated by a comparable problem of solar system dynamics : what fraction of comets and asteroids are destroyed by colliding with the sun ?",
    "several planetary resonances are involved in the fact that almost half of a sample of near - earth asteroids end by colliding with the sun ( farinella et al 1994 ) .",
    "it is also a common fate of short - period comets ( levison & duncan 1994 ) .",
    "the nearby globular cluster m4 contains a triple system in which a distant companion , of mass comparable with or somewhat larger than jupiter s mass , is in orbit about a binary consisting of a white dwarf and a millisecond pulsar .",
    "it is likely to have formed in a four - body scattering encounter between two binaries ( rasio et al 1995 , ford et al 2000 , fregeau et al 2005 ) .",
    "consider a three - body scattering event involving a binary , with components of mass @xmath0 , and a third single star of mass @xmath1 . in this section",
    "we shall be concerned with situations where the encounter is both _",
    "tidal _ and _ adiabatic_. let the ( initial ) semi - major axis of the binary be @xmath2 , and @xmath3 the typical relative velocity of the components .",
    "then we shall estimate @xmath4 , as in a circular orbit , where @xmath5 .",
    "let the relative speed of the star and the binary , when far apart , be @xmath6 , and let @xmath7 be the distance of closest approach between them .",
    "taking a keplerian approximation for their relative motion , we see that , at close approach , their relative speed is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , while the eccentricity of their relative motion is @xmath10 . by plotting the curves",
    "@xmath11 , @xmath12 ( using the foregoing estimates ) and @xmath13 we distinguish those encounters which are near - parabolic , adiabatic and tidal , respectively ( fig.[fig : regions ] ) .",
    "scattering problems like this can be approached analytically in various limiting regimes .",
    "high up in the diagram are non - adiabatic , impulsive encounters , which covers most situations involving `` soft '' binaries . at the bottom , just above the horizontal axis , in the tidal regime , are near - parabolic , adiabatic encounters .",
    "a theoretical study of encounters in this regime was carried out by roy & haddow ( 2003 ) , who gave explicit formulae for the change in energy of the binary during the encounter .",
    "heggie & rasio ( 1996 ) had done a similar job for the change in eccentricity of the binary , and had actually extended their result to the regime of hyperbolic , adiabatic encounters .",
    "this regime is important for one of the problems mentioned earlier ( sec.[subsec : clusters ] ) , viz .",
    "the evolution of planetary systems in star clusters , where typical values of @xmath6 are comparable with the orbital velocity of a planet at a few au . the main purpose of the present section is to extend the principal result of roy & haddow to this regime .",
    "using first - order perturbation theory , and truncating the perturbing potential between the binary and @xmath1 at quadrupole order , roy & haddow show that the change in energy of the binary is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is time , @xmath16 is the position vector of @xmath1 relative to the barycentre of the binary , and @xmath17 is the perturbing function . in turn",
    ", this can be taken to be of the form @xmath18\\cos m + 3e_4ab\\hat\\ba.\\br\\hat\\bb.\\br\\sin m\\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath19 are , respectively , the semi - major axis , the semi - minor axis and eccentricity of the binary , @xmath20 are unit vectors along the axes of the orbit of the binary , @xmath21 is the mean anomaly of the binary , and the remaining coefficients are defined to be @xmath22 in which @xmath23 is the bessel function of the first kind of order @xmath24 .",
    "roy & haddow proceed to use formulae for parabolic motion for @xmath16 .",
    "we follow their same procedure using formulae for hyperbolic motion ( e.g. plummer 1918 ) , i.e. @xmath25 where @xmath26 are unit vectors aligned with the axes of the hyperbolic relative orbit of @xmath1 , @xmath27 are the hyperbolic analogues of @xmath19 for this orbit , and @xmath28 is the eccentric anomaly , related to time by @xmath29 in which @xmath30 and we have assumed @xmath31 at the time of closest approach .",
    "we also have @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the time of pericentric passage in the binary , and @xmath34 .    from eqs.([eq : de ] ) and ( [ eq : perturbing_function ] ) , we see that a typical term in the integrand of @xmath35 is @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath28 .",
    "indeed all the terms in eq.([eq : de ] ) can be expressed in terms of the integral @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a polynomial in @xmath40 and @xmath41 . by means of eq.([eq : kepler ] ) , we then have @xmath42      we handle this integral in the same way as in heggie & rasio ( 1996 ) .",
    "basically the method is steepest descents , but at the location of the saddle of the exponent , it turns out that @xmath43 .",
    "( this is responsible for the pole at about @xmath44 in fig.([fig : complex ] ) . ) first , therefore , we clear off the factors of @xmath45 in the denominator . we deform the contour off the real @xmath28-axis to avoid the singularity at @xmath46 in the following equivalent expression : @xmath47 where we have used the derivative of eq.([eq : r ] ) . integrating by parts",
    "we can convert @xmath48 into @xmath49 , and in differentiating the remainder of the integrand we can treat everything except the exponential as constant : the adiabatic assumption implies that @xmath50 , and so the derivative of the exponential factor dominates .",
    "thus we have approximately @xmath51 where we have made use of eq.([eq : r ] ) again .",
    "doing this twice more gives the approximate result @xmath52    now we deform the contour onto the saddle of the exponent , which occurs where its derivative vanishes , i.e. @xmath53 .",
    "we choose the root @xmath54 , which leads to @xmath55 a quadratic approximation of the exponent around @xmath56 gives @xmath57 now the integral in eq.([eq : after_parts ] ) is easy , and gives @xmath58 since @xmath59 is defined implicitly in terms of @xmath60 and their derivatives ( cf .",
    "eq.([eq : typical_term ] ) ) , it is helpful to know that , when @xmath61 , we have @xmath62 and @xmath63 , where we have used eqs.([eq : br]),([eq : r ] ) and ( [ eq : sinh_cosh ] ) , and the fact that @xmath64 .",
    "( the fact that @xmath43 at the saddle is the reason for the three integrations by parts . )",
    "now we see that the integral ( with respect to @xmath15 ) of eq.([eq : typical_term ] ) is approximately @xmath65 we use eq.([eq : nprime ] ) and the corresponding relation for the binary to eliminate @xmath24 and @xmath66 , and eliminate @xmath67 in favour of the distance of closest approach , @xmath7 .",
    "thus the contribution of this term to @xmath35 in eq.([eq : de ] ) is @xmath68 for ease of comparison , and a little economy , we introduce @xmath69 , and so this contribution to @xmath35 is @xmath70 this is identical with the result of the corresponding terms in roy & haddow ( the unnumbered equation below their eq.(17 ) ) , except for the factor involving @xmath71 , and the exponent . in the limit",
    "@xmath72 the results are in agreement .",
    "we can obtain a more convenient final expression by making the same changes to eq.(19 ) in roy & haddow , yielding @xmath73 + \\nonumber\\\\ & & + e_2b^2[\\sin(2\\omega+nt_0 ) ( 1-\\cos2i)-\\sin(2\\omega+nt_0)\\cos2i\\cos2\\omega-\\nonumber\\\\ & & -3\\sin(2\\omega+nt_0 ) \\cos2\\omega-4\\cos(2\\omega+nt_0)\\sin2\\omega\\cos i ] + \\nonumber\\\\ & & + e_4ab[-2\\cos2i\\cos(2\\omega+nt_0)\\sin2\\omega - 6\\cos(2\\omega+nt_0)\\sin2\\omega-\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.-8\\cos2\\omega\\sin(2\\omega+nt_0)\\cos i]\\right\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 and @xmath75 describe the orientation of the path of @xmath1 in a frame aligned with the elliptical orbit of the binary . thus @xmath76 is the longitude of the ascending node , measured in the plane of the binary from its pericentre in the direction of its motion .",
    "it would be desirable to test this formula numerically .",
    "so far the only tests to have been carried out involve qualitative comparison of scatter plots produced using both this formula and numerical scattering experiments .",
    "one reason why such a comparison is desirable is the cavalier nature of the perturbation calculation we have carried out . in particular",
    "the end result is exponentially small in the ratio @xmath77 , whereas we have neglected terms which are only algebraically small ( e.g. higher order terms omitted in eq.([eq : perturbing_function ] ) ) .",
    "nevertheless the corresponding result for @xmath78 works well ( roy & haddow 2003 )",
    ". finally we remark that eq.([eq : result ] ) gives a null result when @xmath79 .",
    "roy & haddow show how to deal with this when the encounter is parabolic , and it is expected that a result for the general case could be provided along the lines of the above calculation .",
    "i warmly thank the organisers of the meeting for making it possible to participate , and for their kind hospitality .",
    "i also thank doug lin , rainer spurzem and mirek giersz for attracting my interest to the problem of stellar perturbations of a planetary system .",
    "mirek in particular drew attention to the importance of the eccentricity @xmath71 , and to an error in the original version of fig.1 .",
