    "the first observations of solid co@xmath0 ( henceforth co@xmath4 ) were made by the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras , @xcite ) .",
    "the molecule has since been observed in numerous environments , including towards galactic centre sources @xcite , massive protostars @xcite , low mass ysos @xcite , background stars @xcite , and in other galaxies @xcite .",
    "based on these observations , co@xmath4 is seen to be seemingly ubiquitous , and one of the most abundant solid phase molecular species , approximately 1034  %  h@xmath0o .",
    "it is believed to form in the solid phase , due to low gas phase abundances @xcite , with evidence suggesting that much co@xmath4 production occurs in quiescent regions @xcite , yet the key question remains : how does co@xmath4 form ?",
    "many experimental studies have been performed to study the energetic formation routes to co@xmath0 .",
    "irradiation of pure co ices with photons @xcite , charged particles @xcite , and electrons @xcite have yielded co@xmath0 .",
    "similar experiments with mixtures of co and h@xmath0o were also successful @xcite . the irradiation of hydrogenated carbon grains with ions and electrons produced small quantities of co and co@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "co@xmath4 is abundant in quiescent , as well as star - forming regions . while the role of energetic pathways can not be discounted entirely in these regions",
    "@xcite , the study of non - energetic formation routes is fundamental to fully understanding the observed abundances of co@xmath4 .",
    "potential non - energetic formation routes @xcite are : @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8    theoretical studies of route ( [ eqn : co+o ] ) suggest that the formation of co@xmath0 proceeds with a high barrier of around 2500  3000  k , lowered on surfaces via the hot o atom or eley - rideal mechanisms @xcite .",
    "a solid phase study determined that this pathway was feasible only via reaction in water pores , under a water ice cap , and upon heating @xcite , suggesting that it would not occur under the conditions present in quiescent molecular clouds .",
    "reactions ( [ eqn : hco+o ] ) and ( [ eqn : hco+oh ] ) have never been studied expressly in the solid phase .",
    "route ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) has been extensively studied in the gas phase , both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite , due to its importance in atmospheric and combustion chemistry . recently ,",
    "reaction ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) was experimentally studied in the solid phase by reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy ( rairs ) for the first time , with positive results @xcite . due to the limitations of the adopted method , it was not possible to produce a pure beam of oh , and therefore the chemistry is difficult to constrain with a simple series of reactions ; in particular , it was experimentally complex to distinguish between ( [ eqn : co+oh])([eqn : hco+oh ] ) .",
    "oh was produced in the gas phase via a plasma discharge of h@xmath0o , a process which yields a mixture of products including oh , h , h@xmath0 , o and o@xmath0 .",
    "although it is claimed that all oh radicals are in the rovibrational ground state due to collisions with the beam walls , well defined spectroscopic studies of plasma discharges suggest that interaction with the walls is likely to lead to oh recombination , rather than yield ground state oh , and that the major components of a plasma of h@xmath0o are h@xmath0 and h@xmath0o , with lower abundances of oh @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experiments in the absence of co produced h@xmath0o@xmath0 and o@xmath1 , whose yields varied with surface temperature , suggesting that surface temperature itself , mobility of the discharge products on the surface , and , potentially , the desorption rate of co from the surface , rather than the rovibrational state of the oh , is responsible for the changing yields of co@xmath0 observed at different temperatures .",
    "finally , reaction ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) was found to proceed with little or no barrier , suggesting the presence of rovibrationally excited oh . we contend that , under these conditions , the co@xmath0 yield can not be assumed to be independent of the excitation state of oh and thus further study of reaction ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) is imperative .",
    "a subsequent rairs study produced oh in the solid phase from a mixture of o@xmath0:co in a multilayer regime @xcite . due to",
    "the multilayer regimes investigated , both previous studies also involved more complex chemistry than simply co@xmath0 formation , such as the formation of h@xmath0co@xmath1 and ch@xmath1oh , which further complicate the quantitative analysis of reaction ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) .",
    "here we present the first temperature - programmed desorption ( tpd ) spectra of co@xmath4 formed via ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) in the solid phase , under interstellar conditions of temperature and pressure . in this study ,",
    "oh was produced on the surface by reaction of o@xmath0 and o@xmath1 with h in order to constrain better the reaction pathways in the system .",
    "the reaction was studied on both an amorphous silicate and a non - porous water surface , in a low coverage regime , with the aim of limiting chemistry to only co@xmath0 production .",
    "in contrast to previous studies , a simple kinetic model was developed to determine relative reaction efficiencies and calculate the activation energy of reaction ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) .",
    "experiments were performed using the formolism apparatus @xcite . briefly , the experimental set - up consists of an ultra high vacuum ( uhv ) chamber ( base pressure @xmath9  10@xmath10  mbar ) , containing an amorphous silicate - coated copper surface ( 5400  k , @xcite ) .",
    "molecules are dosed onto the surface via two triply differentially pumped beam lines .",
    "desorption of molecules from the surface is monitored using a quadrupole mass spectrometer ( qms ) , positioned directly in front of the surface .",
    "experiments were performed on either bare silicate , or a non - porous , amorphous water film ( _ np_-h@xmath0o ) of @xmath9100  monolayers ( ml ) grown on the silicate by spraying water vapour from a microchannel array doser ( held at 120  k during water desorption , then cooled to 10  k before commencing the experiments ) .",
    "two different surfaces were investigated in order to , firstly , mimic two interstellar environments and , secondly , to determine the surface dependency of route ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) .",
    "amorphous silicate is an appropriate mimic of interstellar dust grains , composed of siliceous and carbonaceous material @xcite . in molecular clouds these grains",
    "are covered in an ice mantle , the largest component of which is h@xmath0o , at abundances of up to 100  ml @xcite .",
    "_ np_-h@xmath0o was used in this study to eliminate the complexity of chemistry occurring in pores .",
    "neither o@xmath1 nor o@xmath0 has been observed in an interstellar ice , so these experimental conditions are not directly astrophysically relevant , but were used to produce oh in a controlled , reproducible manner .",
    "it is experimentally complex to create , maintain , and deposit onto a surface , a pure , stable beam of the oh radical in the ground state .",
    "thus , in this work , oh was produced on the surface via two routes : the hydrogenation of o@xmath0 and of o@xmath1 .",
    "o@xmath0 is easier to utilise experimentally , but a study involving both species constrains reaction mechanisms better than using a single species .",
    "due to the limits of sensitivity of the qms , quantities below 0.1  ml were not investigated .",
    "oh was not measured directly on the surface , due to its short lifetime , but the production of o@xmath0 , h@xmath0o@xmath0 and h@xmath0o , during control experiments on the hydrogenation of o@xmath0 and o@xmath1 , confirms its presence , according to the reaction scheme :    @xmath11    @xmath12    figure  [ fig - network ] describes the chemical network of oh relevant to these experiments .",
    "the oh radical , produced by ( [ eqn : o3+h ] ) and ( [ eqn : o2+xh ] ) , could react with co as in ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) to produce co@xmath0 , or with h to form h@xmath0o , thus , the relative rate of these reactions is an important factor determining the yield of co@xmath0 and the aim of this work was to elucidate the relative rates of these reactions .",
    "all experiments are summarised in table  [ tbl1 ] ; approximately 1.5  ml of o@xmath1 or 0.5  ml of o@xmath0 were dosed onto the surface via one molecular beam , followed by @xmath90.5  ml of isotopically labelled @xmath13co via a second beam .",
    "finally , h atoms were deposited , via a plasma discharge of h@xmath0 on beam 1 , for a range of exposure times of between 0 and 20 minutes .",
    "the deposition rate of h on the surface was @xmath9  5  x  10@xmath14 atoms @xmath15s@xmath16 , taking into account the dosing pressure and the dissociation rate of h@xmath0 @xcite . during o@xmath1 deposition ,",
    "the surface was held at 45  k to ensure that any traces of o@xmath0 present in the o@xmath1 beam desorbed from the surface ( for detailed o@xmath1 production method , see @xcite ) ; it was then cooled to 10  k before continuing .",
    "for all other molecules , the surface was held at 10  k during dosing .",
    "h atoms were hot when produced in the plasma discharge of h@xmath0 , but cooled to room temperature before exiting the molecular beam , due to collisions with the walls .",
    "isotopically labelled @xmath13co was used to avoid contamination of the results by @xmath14co@xmath0 or @xmath14co , pollutants present at very low gaseous concentrations in the chamber .    to measure the products of the reaction ,",
    "the surface was heated from 10 to 100  k ; desorbing molecular species were monitored with the qms .",
    "each tpd cycle lasted approximately three hours .",
    "figure  [ fig - tpd ] shows tpd spectra of @xmath13co@xmath0 produced by h irradiation of o@xmath1 with @xmath13co , and o@xmath0 with @xmath13co .",
    "@xmath13co@xmath0 was produced during all experiments where h irradiation was performed .",
    "the @xmath17 desorbs from each surface over a similar temperature range , but with a slightly different peak shape , indicative of the roughness of the underlying surfaces .",
    "it is clear that , since all data in figure  [ fig - tpd ] are measured at the same h irradiation time , substantially more @xmath13co@xmath0 is produced by the reaction of o@xmath1 than o@xmath0 .",
    "this is evident from reactions ( [ eqn : o3+h ] ) and ( [ eqn : o2+xh ] ) : three hydrogenation steps are required to generate a single oh radical from o@xmath0 , whereas o@xmath1 also generates an oh directly .",
    "as the solid blue line in figure  [ fig - tpd ] shows , if the experiment was conducted without h irradiation , no @xmath13co@xmath0 was produced . nor was @xmath13co@xmath0 production seen during control tpds of @xmath13co , o@xmath0 or o@xmath1 .",
    "when @xmath13co was not present , h@xmath0o and h@xmath0o@xmath0 formed , rather than @xmath13co@xmath0 .",
    "it was assumed that all the @xmath13co@xmath0 formed during h irradiation , in agreement with previous experiments @xcite . within the limits of measurement ,",
    "no gas phase @xmath13co@xmath0 was observed during the irradiation , indicating that the @xmath13co@xmath0 remained on the surface .",
    "no additional @xmath13co@xmath0 was produced during the tpds because control experiments , where o@xmath1 was irradiated with h before deposition of @xmath13co , yielded negligible @xmath13co@xmath0 , suggesting that when oh is produced , it reacts quickly on the surface .",
    "when searched for , we saw no evidence of the production of h@xmath13cooh , validating the hypothesis that investigating a submonolayer coverage restricts the chemistry to co@xmath0 production , unlike previous studies @xcite .",
    "neither were h@xmath18co nor @xmath13ch@xmath1oh seen in desorption .",
    "however , h@xmath0 , @xmath14co , @xmath13co , @xmath14co@xmath0 were seen during all tpds ; @xmath13co@xmath0 was seen upon h irradiation ; h@xmath0o@xmath0 , h@xmath0o were seen upon h irradiation , during extended tpds to higher temperature ; o@xmath1 was seen only when o@xmath1 had been deposited ; o@xmath0 was seen in all experiments , except those with o@xmath1 and no h irradiation .",
    "figure  [ fig - co2 ] illustrates @xmath13co@xmath0 production as a function of h irradiation time ( solid symbols ) .",
    "it is clear that @xmath13co@xmath0 was produced at comparable rates on both surfaces ( solid triangles versus solid squares ) , regardless of the starting material ( o@xmath0 or o@xmath1 ) , vindicating our earlier conclusion that the underlying surface does not play a significant role in this reaction . in every experiment , some @xmath13co desorbed during the tpd , suggesting it was present in excess , never completely reacting with oh or h. in addition , as o@xmath1 , o@xmath0 and h were dosed via one beam , while @xmath13co was dosed via a second , even after alignment the maximum overlap attainable is less than 100  % , so not all reagents were dosed on the same region of the surface .",
    "conversely , as figure  [ fig - co2 ] shows , the reactions are very sensitive to the quantity of oh generated , which itself depends upon the starting quantity of o@xmath0 or o@xmath1 on the surface .",
    "although surface coverages were controlled to within @xmath19  0.2  ml between experiments , this difference was sufficient to account for the varying concentration of @xmath13co@xmath0 observed in figure  [ fig - co2 ] .",
    "the maximum yield of @xmath13co@xmath0 was @xmath9  8  % with respect to @xmath13co ( table  [ tbl1 ] , experiments f , k ) ; the presence of a complex barrier helps to explain this .",
    "gas phase and theoretical studies predict a three - stage barrier ( @xmath9  500  k , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the reaction proceeds via an energetic hoco intermediate , which isomerises from _",
    "trans_-hoco to _ cis_-hoco , before dissociating to form co@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that a precursor oh - co complex forms prior to the hoco intermediate . on a surface ,",
    "the reaction probability is even more reliant upon the relative orientation of co and oh . a recent theoretical study on a coronene surface shows that oh physisorbs with the hydrogen atom pointing towards the surface @xcite .",
    "compared to the gas phase , the activation barrier to _",
    "trans_-hoco formation is slightly lowered , and the intermediate stabilised . a barrierless reaction between this stabilised hoco complex with a further h atom could produce co@xmath0 + h@xmath0 .",
    "however , experiments suggest this reaction could also yield hcooh or h@xmath0o + co @xcite , while reaction with oh could yield h@xmath0co@xmath1 @xcite . from the results presented here ,",
    "it is not possible to determine whether @xmath13co@xmath0 formed from _",
    "cis_-hoco @xmath20 co@xmath0 + h , or by hydrogenation of hoco , although no h@xmath13cooh was observed when tpds were run to 200  k , thus we assume that , under our experimental conditions , reaction ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) produces only @xmath13co@xmath0 .",
    "this complex barrier somewhat explains the low @xmath13co@xmath0 yields , but there are further constraints to be considered . due to the low coverages investigated here ,",
    "the probability of @xmath13co and oh meeting on the surface is small .",
    "oh recombination could produce h@xmath0o@xmath0 , or the competitive reaction oh + h could remove oh from the surface @xcite .",
    "also , in these experiments , @xmath13co was dosed after o@xmath1 or o@xmath0 , so at high enough coverages it could block h from reaching these reagents , allowing co hydrogenation to artificially dominate .",
    "previous studies show that hydrogenation of o@xmath1 @xcite and o@xmath0 @xcite occurs with no barrier , while hydrogenation of co proceeds via : @xmath21 with a barrier of 390  k at 12  k to co + h @xcite . here , the @xmath13co surface coverage was always below 1  ml , and neither h@xmath18co nor @xmath13ch@xmath1oh desorbed during extended tpds , indicating that little @xmath13co hydrogenation occurred .",
    "if h@xmath13co was not produced in significant concentrations via ( [ eqn : co+h ] ) , it follows that @xmath13co@xmath0 was not produced at measurable quantities via ( [ eqn : hco+oh ] ) , not least due to the low probability of any h@xmath13co produced encountering oh on the surface .",
    "these conclusions indicate that in this experiment @xmath13co@xmath0 formation occurred exclusively via reaction ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) .",
    "a simple kinetic model of the experimental system was developed to describe the production of @xmath13co@xmath0 via ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) , based on a set of coupled first order rate equations .",
    "figure  [ fig - network ] shows the potential detailed reaction scheme for these experiments .",
    "however , as illustrated above , given the low surface coverages employed here , a number of reactions , for example oh recombination , can be eliminated and are thus shown in grey in the figure .",
    "neither co@xmath0 nor hcooh react further with h @xcite , so such reactions were also ignored in the model . as discussed above ,",
    "h@xmath13co was likely not produced at significant concentrations in these experiments .",
    "however , the rate of co hydrogenation under present conditions was constrained by control experiments with only co on the surface .",
    "it was assumed that the underlying surface had no effect on the reaction rate ( as illustrated by figure  [ fig - co2 ] ) , so the model treats both surfaces simultaneously .",
    "the best fit to the experimental data was found by varying the rates of reaction , k@xmath22 , of co + oh and h@xmath0o@xmath0 + h , while constraining all other k@xmath22 with empirical data ( reactions shown in black in figure  [ fig - network ] ) . that only two free parameters ( k@xmath23 and k@xmath24 ) were required to fit all of the data presented here , provides strong evidence for the validity of the model , and our previous deductions that all @xmath13co@xmath0 in our experiments was produced via reaction ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) .",
    "the results of the model are plotted over the experimental data as open symbols in figure  [ fig - co2 ] , and are summarised in table  [ tbl2 ] . at low h irradiation times",
    ", the model describes well the production of @xmath13co@xmath0 , but starts to deviate slightly at longer times .",
    "this could be attributed to route ( [ eqn : hco+oh ] ) becoming competitive , but in that case , the o@xmath1 and o@xmath0 experiments should deviate with the same trend , while in reality the production of @xmath13co@xmath0 from o@xmath1 is slightly overestimated while that from o@xmath0 is underestimated .",
    "reaction  ( [ eqn : o3+h ] ) is exothermic @xcite , so the excess energy of this reaction could be transferred to the products , which may then desorb from the surface .",
    "the model does not account for this possibility , and thus overestimates the @xmath13co@xmath0 yield by the o@xmath1 route .",
    "the model , while a simplistic approach to explaining the surface chemistry , as it ignores the complexity of the barrier known to exist in the co + oh pathway , suggests that the relatively low yield of @xmath13co@xmath0 in these experiments results from competition between ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) and other reactions involving oh . the relation between key reaction rates is : @xmath25 indicating that water formation should always dominate the formation of ice species at low surface coverages .",
    "the overall effective reaction rate of co + oh was determined to be 24 times slower than hydrogenation of oh , o@xmath1 or o@xmath0 , and 1.7 times faster than co + h. the relative rate between the hydrogenation of o@xmath0 and co was 40 , while between the hydrogenation of o@xmath0 and h@xmath0o@xmath0 , it was 8 , consistent with literature values of 31  90 and 3.3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the factor of two difference between this and the previous value of @xmath26 can be explained by the fact that molecular species such as h@xmath0o@xmath0 were more accessible to h in our ( approximately 1  ml ) experiments and therefore reacted more quickly than in the multilayer regime of @xcite .",
    "it is not possible to extract the activation barrier for hoco formation or its subsequent reactions to form co@xmath0 in reaction ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) from the model .",
    "we can , however , calculate an effective barrier to co@xmath0 production by comparison of our modelled relative rates to the activation barrier of 390  k at 12  k for co + h @xcite . if we assume first order kinetics and a constant pre - exponential factor in both reactions , the effective barrier to ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) is 384  @xmath19  40  k , where the error is derived from the barrier to hydrogenation of co. this is the first calculation of the effective barrier to ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) in the solid phase , and our result is contradictory to that of oba et al ( 2010 ) who conclude that , in their study , the reaction proceeds with little or no activation barrier , but do not calculate a value . as suggested above , the presence of some fraction of excited oh in the beam could produce co@xmath0 in a barrierless reaction with co. current grain models include grain surface activation barriers to ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) of e.g. 80  k ( y. aikawa 2010 , private communication ) or 176  k @xcite , which would seem very low for an effective first order rate equation , potentially overproducing co@xmath0 .",
    "all evidence suggests that co + oh is a more efficient route to co@xmath0 formation than the non - energetic co + o route , reaction ( [ eqn : co+o ] ) , yet @xcite estimate the barrier to ( [ eqn : co+o ] ) is only 290  k , and suggest that the reaction proceeds under quiescent cloud conditions .",
    "if this were correct , then in comparison to the results of @xcite and those presented here , co + o would be more likely to proceed than either co + h or co + oh .",
    "we feel , therefore , that it is relevant to address briefly the value of the co + o barrier as derived by @xcite which , if implemented in gas - grain models , would result in the incorrect pathway to co@xmath0 formation dominating the reaction scheme .",
    "@xcite derived the barrier from an experiment where a water ice cap was deposited on top of co which had previously been exposed to o atoms , assuming that reaction ( [ eqn : co+o ] ) occurred in the water pores as the surface was heated , and explicitly relying upon the reagents being trapped at the surface by the water ice cap .",
    "although other laboratory studies show that co trapping can occur in water ice pores @xcite , observations and models confirm that co freeze - out occurs after the formation of water ice layers in both molecular clouds @xcite and protostellar disks @xcite , implying that a water ice cap is not a realistic mimic of any interstellar ice , including those found in quiescent regions .",
    "in fact , scenarios investigating reaction ( [ eqn : co+o ] ) by @xcite under conditions comparable to those present in quiescent molecular clouds yielded no co@xmath0 , nor did subsequent experimental studies by @xcite . together with the effective barrier to ( [ eqn : co+oh ] ) of 384  @xmath19  40  k presented here ,",
    "this suggests the importance of readdressing the value of the co + o barrier implemented in astrochemical models .",
    "the reaction of co + oh is seen to be viable under astrophysical conditions of temperature and pressure , on silicate and _ np_-h@xmath0o surfaces .",
    "small quantities of co@xmath0 were produced , in competition with other reactions involving oh ( for example hydrogenation of oh to form h@xmath0o ) .",
    "thus , the mechanism co + oh could be key to explaining the formation of co@xmath4 at the edges of dark clouds ( low a@xmath3 ) , where co@xmath4 is seen to form concurrently with h@xmath0o on bare dust grains @xcite , before a large quantity of co ice is present .    by modelling the reaction",
    "we have determined the empirical relationship @xmath2 , where the overall effective rate of co + oh is determined to be 24 times slower than oh + h , and 1.7 times faster than co + h , indicating why h@xmath0o ice is always the most abundant species .",
    "in dense molecular clouds , gas phase hydrogen is observed to be mainly in the molecular form , but atomic h is present at a constant , low abundance ( h / h@xmath0  @xmath9  10@xmath27 , @xcite ) due to the balance of h@xmath0 formation on grain surfaces and its destruction by cosmic rays . the abundance of oh increases with density , in line with that of o ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , after the freeze - out of co , the reaction co + oh could proceed on the ice mantle due to higher abundances of co on the grain surface .",
    "as the abundance of oh increases , so does the potential for formation of co@xmath0 via co + oh . the formation of h@xmath0o via the competitive reaction oh + h will also increase with density , and thus co@xmath0 and h@xmath0o formation in central , more quiescent regions of molecular clouds is possible .",
    "this conclusion agrees well with the postulations of @xcite .",

    "<S> the formation of co@xmath0 in quiescent regions of molecular clouds is not yet fully understood , despite co@xmath0 having an abundance of around 1034  %  h@xmath0o . </S>",
    "<S> we present a study of the formation of co@xmath0 via the non - energetic route co + oh on non - porous h@xmath0o and amorphous silicate surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> our results are in the form of temperature - programmed desorption spectra of co@xmath0 produced via two experimental routes : o@xmath0 + co + h and o@xmath1 + co + h. the maximum yield of co@xmath0 is around 8  % with respect to the starting quantity of co , suggesting a barrier to co + oh . </S>",
    "<S> the rate of reaction , based on modelling results , is 24 times slower than o@xmath0 + h. our model suggests that competition between co@xmath0 formation via co + oh and other surface reactions of oh is a key factor in the low yields of co@xmath0 obtained experimentally , with relative reaction rates @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> astrophysically , the presence of co@xmath0 in low a@xmath3 regions of molecular clouds could be explained by the reaction co + oh occurring concurrently with the formation of h@xmath0o via the route oh + h. </S>"
