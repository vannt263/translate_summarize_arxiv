    "ngc6752 is a core - collapsed nearby globular cluster ( gc ) containing five millisecond pulsars ( msps ) , whose precise projected positions in the sky have been recently obtained by damico et al .",
    "three of them reside in the gc core . in contrast , the other two pulsars are located in the cluster outskirts . at present , they are the two outermost objects from the center of their host cluster known in the catalogue of 41 pulsars in gcs with accurately determined positions ( the third ranked object being psr b2127 + 11c in m15 ) . the first , psr j1911@xmath25958a ( psr - a according to damico et al .",
    "2002 ) is a binary msp found at more than 3.3 half - mass radii away from the cluster center ( corresponding to @xmath3 pc ) .",
    "its companion is a dwarf ( probably degenerate ) star of mass @xmath4 , moving with period @xmath5 days on a circular orbit around psr - a ( with eccentricity @xmath6 , damico at al .",
    "the orbital separation is @xmath7 au , and the binary has a gravitational binding energy @xmath8 psr - a is spinning with a period of 3.27 ms , has an inferred magnetic field of @xmath9 gauss and a characteristic age @xmath10 gyr ; in short , it looks like a `` canonical '' recycled msp ( lorimer 2001 ) .",
    "the second , psr j1911 - 6000c , is located at 1.4 half mass radii away from the core and is a msp similar to psr - a .",
    "however it lacks of a companion star and this hints for a scenario in which psr - c has been propelled at its current position by a ionization event with a rare high speed star . in this paper",
    "we will focus our attention on psr - a as we can constrain its evolution from its binary nature .",
    "psr - a is 4 times more offset than the neutron star binary pulsar psr b2127 + 11c in m15 ( anderson et al .",
    "1990 ) , and has a much lighter companion .",
    "for psr b2127 + 11c , phinney & sigurdsson ( 1991 ) explored an ejection scenario in which the pulsar exchanged its light donor star with a neutron star ( ns ) flying by .",
    "can we explain the _ nature _ of psr - a in similar terms ?    in this paper",
    "we consider three possible explanations : _ ( 1 ) _ psr - a , remnant of a massive star , was the component of a truly _ primordial binary _ born in the gc halo or expelled from the gc core due to the natal kick imparted by the supernova explosion ; _ ( 2 ) _ it was ejected from the core via _ scattering _ or _",
    "interaction(s ) with cluster _ stars _ ; or _ ( 3 ) _ it was propelled into the cluster halo by a _ scattering _ event involving a _ black hole binary _ ( hereafter [ bh+bh ] ) .    in this letter",
    "we will investigate all these three alternatives with special consideration to the third , less intuitive , most intriguing hypothesis .",
    "this is in part motivated by the recent discovery that ngc6752 shows an unusual high mass - to - light ratio @xmath11 in its inner region , corresponding to a mass @xmath12 in the form of low luminosity stellar remnants in its core ( damico et al .",
    "in addition , x - ray observations ( pooley et al . 2001 ) combined with upper limits on the gas content of the gc ( damico et al . 2002 ) seem not to exclude that a significant fraction of @xmath13 is due to a central ( perhaps binary ) bh of a few hundreds solar masses . 1.truecm",
    "this is the simplest hypothesis among the three .",
    "it requires orbital stability against dynamical friction , and a low recoil speed at the moment of ns formation .",
    "orbital stability depends on binary mass , initial apocentric distance @xmath14 and orbital eccentricity , @xmath15 we computed the dynamical friction timescale @xmath16 for a 1/@xmath17 reduction of @xmath14 in the case of a point mass @xmath18 moving in the cluster potential ( approximated as a king model ) under the action of the frictional force ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , considering @xmath19 . for a centrophobic halo orbit ( @xmath20 )",
    "we find that @xmath16 is @xmath21 yr in ngc6752 , implying stability of psr - a and of its progenitor halo binary .",
    "if the binary has been propelled into a highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath22 ) at the time of ns formation , it would remain at the periphery for a time @xmath23 yr before returning to the core .",
    "whenever @xmath24 it is the dynamical friction time that sets the conditions on detectability .",
    "how orbital stability combines with the problem of retention of psr - a in ngc6752 ?",
    "it is known from current proper motion measurements of 13 msps belonging to the galaxy ( toscano et al .",
    "1999 ) that msps have relatively large mean transverse velocities of 85@xmath25 and a 3-d peculiar mean speed of @xmath26 ( lyne et al . 1998",
    "; see also cordes & chernoff 1997 ) .",
    "theoretical studies aimed at estimating the minimum recoil speeds @xmath27 ( for those binary msps that invoke a common envelope phase preceding the formation of the ns ; tauris & bailes 1996 ) predict for psr - a a recoil velocity @xmath28 on the basis of its observed orbital period .",
    "if the cluster escape velocity at the time of the supernova explosion was similar to the current value @xmath29 for the center of ngc6752 , the retention of psr - a in the cluster is indeed problematic . if the supernova took place in the central regions , the binary of psr - a ( of mass @xmath30 after the ns has formed ) would have been driven back to the core by dynamical friction in @xmath31 gyr due to the high orbital eccentricity . as the supernova blew off in the first gyr since gc formation , the binary",
    "would not have survived in the halo until present time .",
    "psr - a may , alternatively , descend from a binary born in the cluster outskirts with the faintest kick ever observed ( considering that @xmath32 in the halo ) .",
    "this scenario calls for the ns of psr - a being probably formed from the accretion - induced collapse of a massive white dwarf ( grindlay et al .",
    "1988 ) : in fact in this case collapse is not accompanied by severe mass losses and this could minimize the center - of - mass runaway impulse speed . in this case , the time @xmath33 is consistent with the life - time of psr - a and its evolution .    given the estimated number @xmath34 of primordial msps in the galactic field ( e.g. lorimer 2001 ) and mass ratio @xmath35 between all known ( @xmath36 ) gcs and the milky way , it turns out that the overall number of msps born in the halo from a primordial binary is nearly @xmath37 , where @xmath38 corrects for the mass fraction outside radius @xmath39 in a typical gc normalized to its value at @xmath39 equal to 3 half - mass radii .",
    "this is a very low number considering that refers to all gcs known .",
    "if psr - a has been ejected out of the core by a cluster star the key issue is whether three - body exchange is favored against inelastic scattering . to address this question , we need to consider the binary nature of psr - a and to distinguish cases in which a dynamical interaction occurs before recycling ( when the companion to psr - a has mass of @xmath40 ) or following it ( when its mass is @xmath41 ) .",
    "we recall that just at the onset of recycling a `` bifurcation '' orbital period @xmath42 separates the formation of a converging binary ( which evolves with decreasing orbital period @xmath43 until the mass - losing star becomes degenerate and a short - period binary pulsar is formed ) from a diverging one ( which evolves with increasing @xmath44 forming a long period binary pulsar ; tauris & savonije 1999 ) . given this scenario , psr -",
    "a should result from a converging binary .",
    "thus , at the onset of recycling we use an upper limit on @xmath45 days and , as customarily , a mass of the donor star @xmath46 .    scattering can occur either before or after recycling as it preserves , to a high degree , the circularity seen in our binary pulsar . in both cases , a recoil kinetic energy of @xmath47 is requested for ejecting [ ns@xmath48+co ] ( comprising either psr - a or the not yet recycled ns and its companion ) into its halo orbit .",
    "as this must be extracted from the [ ns@xmath49+co ] binding energy , recoil at @xmath50 imposes an upper limit on the orbital period @xmath51 which is @xmath52 days .",
    "we infer this value using a collection of scattering events extracted from sigurdsson & phinney ( 1993 ) : table 1 gives the binary recoil speed @xmath53 ( third column ) for @xmath51 ( first line of each case ) , for a period corresponding to the current binary separation ( second line ) , and for @xmath42 ( third line ) .",
    "since psr - a is a converging system , its period can not have ever been shorter than its current value of 0.86 days and this excludes the scattering hypothesis .",
    "exchange alters the nature of the interacting system and makes the new binary rather eccentric and with a longer orbital period .",
    "thus due to the prohibitively long circularization time between compact stars , exchange has to occur before recycling .",
    "we consider the case ( see table 1 ) of a main sequence binary [ ms+ms ] ( ms heavier than ms ) interacting with the ns@xmath48 flying by ( given the similar masses of ms and ns@xmath48 , the results are almost unaffected when swapping their role ) .",
    "we find that the target binary needs to be very tightly bound to produce the new system [ ns@xmath48+co ] ; after the exchange [ ns@xmath48+co ] has an orbital period suspiciously close to the currently observed value considering that recycling has not occurred yet ; characteristic times @xmath54 years for exchange ( see table 1 ; first line of both exchange cases ) are also found uncomfortably long in this case .",
    "the dynamics of bhs in gcs involves repeated exchange interactions and ejections ( sigurdsson & hernquist 1993 ; portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) .",
    "this cosmic dance occurred early in the cluster lifetime among the rich population ( of few hundreds ) of bhs , born from the most massive stars : as they sink toward the center by dynamical friction ( on a time - scale @xmath55 yr ) , bh@xmath2[bh+bh ] interactions become overwhelmingly important .",
    "binaries harden progressively in virtue of these encounters and eventually leave the cluster due to recoil . as a result ,",
    "many clusters lose their original bhs on a time scale of @xmath56 gyr .",
    "however , dynamical studies ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ; miller & hamilton 2002a ) show that some clusters could still retain a binary .",
    "we here consider the fascinating possibility that ngc6752 belongs to this category and try to depict a scenario for the interaction of psr - a with a [ bh+bh ] system .",
    "two separate questions arise : ( _ i_@xmath57 ) for how long can the [ bh+bh ] binary that survived ejection avoid coalescence by emission of gravitational waves ( gws ) ?",
    "( _ ii_@xmath57 ) can the [ bh+bh ] transfer enough kinetic energy to propel psr - a into the cluster halo and what is the probability of this event ? 0.5truecm",
    "here we allow bh masses in binaries to have a relatively wide spectrum from 3 @xmath58 to @xmath59 the bhs may result from the direct collapse of massive progenitor stars ( fryer 1999 ) .",
    "but the massive @xmath60-bhs could be the outcome of exchanges and mergers of many ordinary ( @xmath61 ) bhs ; in particular binary - binary encounters can enhance their formation ( miller & hamilton 2002b ) .",
    "as noticed by miller & hamilton ( 2002a ) , unlike the less massive bhs in binaries which can be easily flung out by recoil before they can merge , the more massive ones could have enough inertia to remain bound to the cluster .",
    "thus , the binary that avoided ejection has likely unequal masses and could harbor the heaviest bh that ngc6752 ever had .",
    "if we indicate with @xmath62 and @xmath63 the masses of the two bhs in the binary , respectively , and with @xmath64 and @xmath65 their total and reduced mass , our hypothetical [ bh+bh ] binary ( with typical eccentricity of @xmath66 ) will avoid coalescence for a time @xmath67 gyr due to emission of gws if its separation @xmath68 exceeds a critical value @xmath69 where a_gw~0.4 ( 100)^1/2 ( 10_gw10 ^ 10 yr)^1/4 au .",
    "[ eq : a_gw ] recoil , instead , imposes a different condition based upon the request that the bh separation is sufficiently large to avoid ejection : the [ bh+bh ] binary that remains bound to ngc6752 should have @xmath70 , where a_rec~0.01 ( 10 ) ( m 10 100 35v_esc ) ^2au .",
    "[ eq : a_rec ] equation ( [ eq : a_rec ] ) is derived knowing that binaries interacting with much lighter intruders ( of mass @xmath71 ) acquire a kinetic energy ( due to recoil ) of the order of @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the binding energy of the [ bh+bh ] that typically produces a recoil at the escape speed @xmath74 from the cluster core ( see miller & hamilton 2002a ; hills 1992 ; quinlan 1996 ) . in figure 1",
    "we show these critical separations ; when @xmath75 coalescence is the correct criterion to use .",
    "after the last encounter with a background bh , the evolution of [ bh+bh ] continues ; what comes into play is its interaction with the bath of cluster stars , of mass @xmath76 line of sight velocity @xmath77 and density @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath79 is the three - body interaction cross section , then the ( still very approximate ) number of stars impinging onto the target binary over a time @xmath80 yr is @xmath81 and gives 210 ^ 3 ( n_*10 ^ 6pc^-3 1006 aa_gwt10 ^ 10yr ) [ eq : n_dot ] for ngc6752 .",
    "each single star carries off an energy @xmath82 so that the [ bh+bh ] hardens in the course of time reaching @xmath83 from an initially much larger separation @xmath84 ( taken to be comparable to the accretion radius ) after experiencing a number of scatterings @xmath85\\ln(a_{\\rm    { acc}}/ a_{\\rm { gw}})$ ] that exceeds @xmath86 _",
    "gw~510 ^ 3 ( 1000.4 ) ( a _ acc80 au0.4aua_gw ) .",
    "[ eq : n_gw ] this secures a [ bh+bh ] lifetime comparable to that of ngc6752 , or slightly shorter .",
    "0.5truecm = 9.truecm = 9.truecm 0.5truecm      let us now come to question ( _ ii@xmath57 _ ) .",
    "in the ejection hypotheses , the binary [ ns@xmath48+co ] must have been propelled into an eccentric peripheral orbit at a speed @xmath87 .",
    "the apocenter then reduces due to dynamical friction but its @xmath17-folding time @xmath88 @xmath89 yr is sufficiently long to permit the detection of psr - a during the pulsar life - time @xmath90 .    in the _ scattering _ off [ bh+bh ] , the light binary [ ns@xmath91+co ]",
    "is viewed as a single point mass . in this case",
    ", [ ns@xmath91+co ] has to avoid break up by the bh tidal field and this imposes a constraint on the distance of closest approach , @xmath92 where r_tid 0.2 ( 100 1.6+m_c)^1/3 .",
    "[ eq : r_tid ] in the inelastic scattering off the hard [ bh+bh ] , most of the released binding energy @xmath93\\,\\,\\epsilon_b$ ] of the binary goes into kinetic energy of the propelled [ ns@xmath48+co ] .",
    "thus for an ejection velocity @xmath53 close to @xmath94 the [ bh+bh ] should have a binary separation smaller than a_scat~ ( gv^2_ej ) ~1.3 ( 10 ) ( 35v_ej)^2au .",
    "[ eq : a_scat ] since scattering leads to an effective energy exchange only when the intruder ( [ ns@xmath48+co ] in this case ) is approaching the binary within a distance @xmath39 comparable to a few orbital separation radii @xmath68 ( beyond which energy exchange is exponentially small ) , conditions ( [ eq : r_tid]-[eq : a_scat ] ) combined with ( [ eq : a_gw ] ) or ( [ eq : a_rec ] ) give a plausible range of binary separations for which injection of [ ns@xmath48+co ] into the cluster halo is possible and this is illustrated in fig .  1 ( shaded area ) .",
    "if the flux of stars on the [ bh+bh ] is of thousands interactions over the cluster lifetime ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : n_dot ] and [ eq : n_gw ] ) , about 1/30 of these encounters should have involved a ns , which gives a rate @xmath95 @xmath96 ( taking as face value 3,000 encounters ) , but it can be higher ( lower ) if the [ bh+bh ] mass is higher ( lower ) . if @xmath97 of the nss is in the state of a msp , then the rate for msp ejection is @xmath98 @xmath99 implying a probability of detection of about @xmath100 considering a life - time for the current orbit of @xmath1 gyr .",
    "we note that @xmath95 is calculated assuming a salpeter - like initial mass function ( giving @xmath101 of nss ) and a mass segregation enhancement of @xmath102 in the density ( sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ) . if the imf is flatter ( as suggested by the observations of damico et al .",
    "2002 ) , this rate could be higher , enhancing the likelihood of this scenario . once ejected into an halo orbit , [ ns@xmath48+co ] spends only @xmath103 of its life in the dense gc core and thus has negligible probability to undergo further interactions ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the unusual position of psr - a in ngc6752 is puzzling .",
    "we have shown that psr - a may result from a primordial binary born in the halo , but this requires an exceptionally weak kick or accretion - induced collapse at the moment of ns formation . a scattering or exchange event off a star that propelled psr - a into the cluster halo",
    "is inconsistent with the conservation of energy and linear momentum . here",
    ", we propose a dynamical interaction with a more massive system , a [ bh+bh ] binary in a mass range of @xmath104 and separation of @xmath56 0.3 - 2 au .",
    "an unequal mass binary with a heavy @xmath105 bh and a lighter companion @xmath61 is preferred , as it can form in a gc ( miller & hamilton 2002a , 2002b ) and can provide the right statistics for explaining psr - a .",
    "light binaries are likely to be ejected ( portegies zwart & mcmillan 2000 ) , while much heavier @xmath106 ones ( with equal mass ) are difficult to form and their presence can be in conflict with x - ray observations if the gas content in ngc6752 is confirmed at the density reported in damico et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ; in addition , the dynamical effects of such a heavy binary on cluster stars could also become severe .",
    "bh could in principle eject psr - a scattering off a star bound to the bh inside the cusp ( frank & rees 1976 ) and this possibility needs to be investigated ; note that ngc6752 has a very low line of sight velocity dispersion and this might imply a runway growth of the bh mass . ]    whether a gc retains its `` last '' bh binary(ies ) or not is unpredictable , as bh ejection depends on a number of rare random events .",
    "it is thus an observational challenge to unveil in the heart of a cluster such an exotic dark binary .",
    "ngc6752 seems a primary candidate for this search .",
