    "only those models where the lines are clearly asymmetric are shown . , and @xmath90au for @xmath93 , and @xmath10 , respectively , because the co lines are highly distorted . ]",
    "the asymmetry increases with @xmath6 independent of the stellar mass as long as the planet orbits closer than the outer boundary of the thermal excitation of co ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) , while it declines with @xmath6 for wider planetary orbits . in the former models , the asymmetry declines if @xmath96 for 1 and @xmath10 , while it strengthens further for @xmath97 stellar masses .    the excitation energy of a given transition increases with @xmath6 , and therefore the larger @xmath6 is , the smaller the radial distance where that line originates .",
    "if @xmath98 has a maximum well inside the co excitation zone , the average @xmath98 is inversely proportional to @xmath99 ( i.e. , to @xmath6 ) , resulting in increasing asymmetry with @xmath6 . on the contrary , if @xmath98 peaks outside the co excitation zone , @xmath98 declines with @xmath6 on average , resulting in an opposite asymmetry@xmath6 relation .",
    "independent of the stellar mass and orbital distance , both the red and blue line peaks shift farther from the line center as @xmath6 increases ( panels ( a)(c ) of figures[fig : rot - diagp ] and [ fig : rot - diagr ] , lower sub - panels ) .",
    "the red peaks are always shifted farther from the line center than the blue peaks , meaning that the lines are off - centered .",
    "the magnitude of the off - centering increases with the stellar mass and decreasing with the orbital distance in the range of @xmath100 .",
    "the off - centering is caused by the excitation levels of the co molecule ( i.e. , the temperature ) , which has the same receding and approaching velocities , being different due to the eccentric orbit of gas parcels . since @xmath98 grows steeper with @xmath99 for smaller @xmath101 , the difference in the level of co excitation at the receding and approaching sides , i.e. , the off - centering , is inversely proportional to @xmath101 .",
    "this effect is naturally magnified by the higher stellar temperature , resulting in stronger off - centering for higher mass stars .",
    "the line asymmetry is sensitive to the disk orientation angle , thus the blue - excess changes to a symmetric , red - excess and so on , since the inner disk precesses with the @xmath102 orbital period of the planet .",
    "this variability , however , is hard to observe within a couple of decades as the precession period is about 250yr for the fastest precession observed in model @xmath92 for a @xmath10 star .",
    "another source of variability might be the slight change in the disk eccentricity as the planet orbits ; however , an observable signal requires a small orbital distance ( @xmath103au ; @xcite ) .",
    "in this letter , we presented fundamental band spectra of the co molecule in circumstellar disks gravitationally perturbed by an embedded @xmath15 , and @xmath104 giant planet orbiting @xmath91 , and @xmath10 stars , respectively , at @xmath105 .",
    "we found that the co lines are asymmetric due to the development of disk eccentricity inside the region where co is thermally excited .",
    "the principal results of our study are :    1 .   a quasi - static , globally eccentric disk state develops inside the planetary orbit with @xmath106 after several thousand orbits by @xmath38yr .",
    "2 .   as a result",
    ", asymmetric lines are formed with magnitude of @xmath107 measured in red versus blue peak , whose strength increases with decreasing orbital distance of the planet .",
    "the lines are off - centered , i.e. , shifted toward the higher flux peak by @xmath108 , such that the smaller the orbital distance of the planet or the larger the stellar mass , the greater the shift .",
    "4 .   the line asymmetry@xmath6 slope informs us whether the giant planet orbits outside ( asymmetry decreases with @xmath6 ) or inside ( asymmetry increases with @xmath6 ) the thermally excited co region .",
    "the critical orbital distance is @xmath109 , and @xmath8 for an @xmath91 , and @xmath10 star , where the asymmetry@xmath6 slope changes its sign .",
    "5 .   for close planetary orbits ( @xmath110 , and @xmath111 for an @xmath91 , and @xmath10 star ) ,",
    "the lines are highly distorted . )",
    ", the co lines do not show clear asymmetry ; rather , highly perturbed lines are formed ( as was shown previously in @xcite ) because the planet - induced gap is formed inside the co excitation region .",
    "the peak distances , peak positions , and magnitude of the central dip are found to be proportional to @xmath6 independent of the planetary and stellar masses .    in light of our findings",
    "( line shape dependency on @xmath6 ) , we have to emphasize that care must be taken when applying line profile averaging in observational studies : averaging of only neighboring transitions ( close in @xmath6 ) are suggested in which case the difference in the line shapes are modest .",
    "since the development of disk eccentricity presumably depends on radiative processes as well as the disks physical parameters ( e.g. , viscosity , aspect ratio , etc . ) and naturally the mass of the perturbing planet , further investigation is inevitable before attempting any detailed characterization of planets from the observed line profiles .",
    "a young ( @xmath0myr ) , gas - rich disk that emits asymmetric co lines may harbor giant planets which should be formed early in the disks life .",
    "the classical core accretion scenario predicts that the formation of giant planet takes @xmath112myr @xcite , which is very close to or even larger than the observed disk lifetimes @xcite .",
    "recently , several theoretical studies of core accretion have reported a shorter formation time ( @xmath0myr ) of giant planets .",
    "planetary migration prevents the severe depletion of the feeding zone as observed in in situ calculations ; however , typei migration must be artificially slowed by an order of magnitude @xcite . assuming a protoplanetary disk with a high solid surface density of @xmath113 and dust opacity in the protoplanet s envelope equals to 2% that of interstellar material will result in a @xmath114myr formation time of a jupiter - mass planet @xcite .",
    "however , the required solid surface density is about an order of magnitude larger than that proposed by the minimum solar mass nebula model at 5.2au assuming a canonical @xmath115 dust - to - gas mass ratio @xcite .",
    "note that giant planets can be formed much faster within the context of gravitational instability theory , but it requires too high disk masses ( @xmath116 ) and an efficient cooling mechanism to operate @xcite .",
    "another possible scenario could be vortex - aided planet formation in which the large - scale anticyclonic vortex developed near the disks outer dead zone edge ( @xcite ) may induce planet formation .",
    "the core of a giant planet is subject to be trapped temporarily in the vortex vicinity @xcite , where large amounts of dusty material are accumulated .",
    "therefore , gas giants can be formed rapidly in both scenarios . in the core - accretion scenario ,",
    "the slow growth regime of the giant planetary core might be circumvented by shortening the slow growth phase within the isolation ( @xmath117 ) and the runaway growth ( @xmath118 ) mass limits . in the gravitational instability scenario ,",
    "the disk might be gravitationally unstable without requiring high disk mass due to the large amount of dusty and gaseous material accumulated in the planetary trap .",
    "as the presented spectroscopic phenomenon can be applied for the characterization of planets still embedded in their host disks , it can deliver new types of empirical tests of planet formation theories .",
