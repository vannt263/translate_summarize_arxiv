    "there has been a large deal of interest in the understanding of mechanism of interplay between random noise and a deterministic periodic signal after the pioneering achievement of separation of large dna molecules in gel medium by the application of uniform and time - dependent periodic electric field @xcite .",
    "it has been found that with this technique large molecules in the size range 2 to 400 kb exihibit size - dependent mobilities .",
    "similar ideas have also arisen in other types of chromatographic processes @xcite .",
    "the first passage time is a useful tool to investigate the diffusive transport property in a medium .",
    "the theory of first passage time has been worked out in great detail for both infinite medium and explicitly time - independent diffusive processes@xcite . however , for explicitly time - dependent processes and in finite medium an analytic closed form expressions are not available . in this respect",
    "also this problem attracts much attentions to the scientific communities .",
    "the first analysis of this phenomena has been done for a random walk on a lattice numerically , and for a diffusive process in a continuous medium with periodic signal of small amplitude perturbatively@xcite .",
    "their results indicate that the oscillating field can create a form of coherent motion capable of reducing the first passage time by a significant amount .",
    "this fact clearly implies that the mobility of a particle in a diffusive medium can be increased by the application of proper oscillating field .",
    "this phenomena thereafter is known in the literatures as coherent stochastic resonance(csr ) .    in order to investigate",
    "the reason for this cooperative behavior of random noise and deterministic periodic signal this problem has been formulated in much simpler terms by approximating the sinusoidal periodic signal by the telegraph signal@xcite and concluded incorrectly that the system exihibits csr .",
    "subsequently it has been shown@xcite that the telegraph signal can not produce csr .",
    "it is then argued @xcite that the low frequency behavior could cause such cooperative behavior .    in this paper",
    "we approximate the sinusoidal signal by a multi - step periodic signal(explained below ) and obtain an expression for the mean first passage time(mfpt ) . after giving the derivation of mfpt in sec.ii ,",
    "the results of the calculations are discussed in sec.iii .",
    "first we present the general characteristics of csr .",
    "the calculation clearly exhibits how resonance appears in our multi - step approximation and fails to show in single - step telegraph approximation of the periodic signal explaining the conjecture of porra@xcite .",
    "the general characteristics of the moments in our calculation are also in agreement with the numerical simulation of random walk model on a lattice@xcite .",
    "the characteristic features of first passage time density function ( fptdf ) for this phenomena are also presented in this subsection . in the next subsection",
    "we focus on the resonance point and demonstrate some universal features associated with it .",
    "subsequent subsection deals with the characteristic changes of the physical variables as we cross , in particular , around the resonance point .",
    "this leads to a better understanding of this cooperative behavior .",
    "finally , few concluding remarks have been added in sec.iv .",
    "we consider diffusion in one dimension perturbed by a periodic force .",
    "the motion of the particle is given by the langevin equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 refers to the stochastic variable , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the amplitude and frequency of the sinusoidal signal and @xmath4 is a zero mean gaussian white noise of strength @xmath5 with auto - correlation function given by @xmath6 the motion is confined between two absorbing boundaries at @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the fokker planck equation corresponding to eq.([eq.1 ] ) is @xmath9 with absorbing boundary conditions at @xmath7 and @xmath8;i.e.,@xmath10 .",
    "we now introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath11 to write eq.([eq.3 ] ) in terms of new variables : @xmath12 the boundary conditions are rewritten as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 . in the following",
    "we calculate all the physical quantities in terms of these new variables and if required , one may translate all the interpretations in terms of the usual variables by the transformation equations eq.[eq.4 ] .",
    "we next approximate the sinusoidal signal by multi - step periodic signal .",
    "the construction is as follows .",
    "we divide the half cycle of the signal by @xmath15 intervals so that each interval in the horizontal @xmath16-axis is of size @xmath17 with @xmath18 .",
    "we define @xmath15numbers @xmath19 along the vertical @xmath20-axis as    [ eq.6 ] @xmath21}{2}~ ; k = 1,2, ... ,p \\\\s_{p+1 } & = & 1 \\\\s_{p+1+r } & = & s_{p+1-r}~ ; r = 1,2, ... ,p .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    each number @xmath22 is associated with the interval@xmath23 with @xmath24 . the eq.([eq.6 ] ) clearly shows that @xmath25 eq.([eq.7 ] ) states that in order to reach the maximum value @xmath26 of the signal from the zero level we have to have @xmath27 step up and from the maximum to the zero level we have @xmath27 step down .",
    "this is for the positive half - cycle . for the negative half - cycle",
    "similar constructions have been done with the replacement @xmath28 and each number @xmath29 is associated with the interval @xmath30<\\theta\\leq \\bigtriangleup \\theta [ 1 + \\frac { k}{2p+1}]$ ] with @xmath31 .",
    "this aproximation for the full one cycle of the sinusoidal signal ( as shown in fig.[fig.1])is then repeated for the next successive cycles .",
    "the construction clearly shows that we get back the usual telegraph signal with @xmath32 .",
    "one may however note that the @xmath33 which we have defined for this approximated signal is not the same as that of sinusoidal signal because the fourier transform of sinusoidal signal would give only one frequency while this approximated signal in the fourier space corresponds to many sinusoidal frequencies specially because of its sharp discontinuities .",
    "yet we urge this approximation because in each interval the equation become time - independent .",
    "in the future development we associate the index @xmath34 for the positive half - cycle and index @xmath35 for the negative .",
    "index @xmath36 will refer the cycle number . since the fokker - planck equation ( eq.([eq.5 ] ) ) in each interval will be that for a constant bias , we can express the conditional probability density function @xmath37 in terms of complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions @xmath38 satisfying the boundary conditions @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40~,\\ ] ] where    [ eq.9 ] @xmath41    with @xmath42 as the corresponding value of @xmath19 in the appropriate interval where the conditional probability is being decomposed .",
    "the conditional probability density function in any interval , say @xmath43 , can then be calculated from the previous history by convoluting it in each previous intervals : @xmath44 for the negative half - cycle the calculation of probability density function is similar except that we have to replace the index @xmath34 by @xmath35 and the probability density function is decomposed as @xmath45~,\\ ] ] where the expressions for @xmath46 and @xmath47 are same as in eqs.([eq.9 ] ) .    the survival probability at time @xmath16 when the particle is known to start from @xmath48 at @xmath49 is defined as @xmath50    the first passage time density function ( fptdf ) @xmath51 is defined as @xmath52 physically",
    ", @xmath53 gives the probability that the particle arrives at any one of the boundaries in the time interval @xmath16 and @xmath54 . from this density function",
    "one can calculate various moments : @xmath55 from eq.([eq.14 ] ) one can easily calculate mean first passage time(mfpt ) @xmath56 and the variance @xmath57 of the density function @xmath51 .",
    "it is then quite straight - forward to calculate the survival probability at any interval of any cycle .",

    "the effect of history is explicit in the expressions for survival probabilities .",
    "once the survival probability @xmath73 is obtained from these formluae , the fptdf , mfpt and the corresponding variance are obtained by employing eqs.([eq.13])-([eq.14 ] ) .",
    "evaluation of mfpt and other relevant quantities requires sum of infinite series which must be truncated in order to obtain a final result .",
    "convergence of mfpt is ensured by gradually increasing the number of terms ( i.e.,number of eigenvalues ) for the calculation .",
    "the process is truncated when mfpt does not change upto two decimal point of accuracy with the change of number of terms .",
    "the survival probability , mean first passage time(mfpt ) , corresponding variances and first passage time density functions(fptdf ) are calculated using the derived formulae for this process .",
    "the results are summarised below .",
    "the mfpt is calculated for single - step telegraph signal @xmath74 with @xmath75 .",
    "most of the calculations are done with this specific value of @xmath76 .",
    "the variation of the results with variation of @xmath76 is also demonstrated [ see the text below ] .",
    "no nonmonotonous behavior is observed in mfpt as we vary the frequency @xmath33 .",
    "this is in complete agreement with porra s observation@xcite .",
    "the calculation is done for the length @xmath77 and the result is shown in the curve @xmath78 of fig.2.however , when we take @xmath79 , i.e. , when the sinusodal signal is approximated by two - step periodic signal , the calculation of mfpt for the same length shows clearly the nonmonotonous behavior .",
    "this is shown in curve @xmath80 of the same figure .",
    "this result clearly demonstrates that mere flipping of the bias ( signal ) direction periodically would not produce the coherent motion . as the rate of flipping increases it merely prevents the particle more to reach the boundaries and therefore mfpt increases monotonically .",
    "it may be noted that when the flipping rate is very high , the effect of signal is almost nil and the transport is effectively diffusive in nature .",
    "this is of course true in any type of periodic signal .",
    "therefore , for any type of approximation of the sinusoidal signal or for any value of @xmath81 , this feature would show up .",
    "in particular , for @xmath79 , we observe from curve @xmath80 of fig.2 that mfpt asymptotically reaches the diffusive limit @xmath82 (= 50 in this case ) .",
    "the usual telegraph signal offers a constant bias of maximum magnitude for the larger time than for a two - step approximation .",
    "hence the particle always has a larger probability of reaching the boundary in short time for @xmath32 case than for @xmath83 case .",
    "hence mfpt for @xmath32 and for any @xmath33 is always less than for @xmath83 case .",
    "this is observed in fig.2 .",
    "the application of any bias always reduces the mfpt than for the non - biased diffusion . in csr",
    "we always have a competition between diffusion and oscillatory effect of the bias .",
    "for very large frequency as the bias effect becomes ineffective mfpt would essentially be guided by diffusive process . for zero frequency of the multi - step periodic signal",
    "the mfpt can be analytically evaluated .",
    "when it starts from the mid - point of the medium it expresses as @xmath84 .",
    "when frequency is very small , the process is predominantly diffusion with constant value @xmath85 effective for @xmath86 .",
    "however , as frequency increases slowly the probability of having increased bias value @xmath87 ( = 1 for @xmath79 ) before it reaches the boundary increases .",
    "this bias force reduces the survival probability and also mfpt .",
    "hence one would expect a minimum to mfpt .",
    "on the otherhand , for usual telegraph signal ( @xmath32 case ) , for very low frequency , from the very beginning bias force affects the particle with its maximum strength .",
    "when the frequency is very low , this constant bias diffusion continues for a longer time and there is no change - over of the magnitude of the bias as in the case of @xmath79 . after having a flip",
    ", the particle again suffers a constant bias diffusion in the direction opposite to the previous one . as frequency increases slowly , this picture remains unchanged until a stage reaches for which the flipping effect becomes dominant during the particle s survivality inside the medium and mfpt increases .",
    "this is observed in fig.2 .",
    "next we continue all our calculation with @xmath88 or , with three - step telegraph signal .",
    "calculation reveals that the value of mfpt does not change much from that with @xmath79 . on the otherhand ,",
    "@xmath88 signal approximates better than @xmath79 signal .",
    "we restrict our calculation with @xmath88 approximation of the periodic signal .",
    "typical survival probability and the corresponding decay rate defined as @xmath89 are plotted as function of @xmath16 for @xmath77 and @xmath90 in fig.3 .",
    "the plot shows that the survival probability [ plot a ] goes through plateau where the change of survival probability is comparatively less .",
    "the decay rate @xmath91 [ plot b ] correspondingly shows a minimum at these points .",
    "this is a characteristic feature for csr .",
    "this feature is in agreement with the numerical simulation of the process as a random walk on a lattice@xcite .",
    "next we calculate the mfpt @xmath56 and the variance @xmath92 as a function of frequency @xmath33 for different lengths@xmath93 .",
    "these are presented in fig.4 and fig.5 respectively .",
    "both the cumulants go through a minimum as frequency rises from very low value for each length @xmath94 .",
    "this feature is also in agreement with the lattice simulation work @xcite .",
    "it is observed that the minimum for both the moments ocuur at the same frequency for each length .",
    "the value of mfpt @xmath56 increases with the length at all frequencies .",
    "this is understandable because as length increases on an average the particle will spent more time in the medium before reaching the boundaries .",
    "it is also observed that the frequency at which the minimum occurs shift towards low frequency as the length increases .",
    "it implies that maximum cooperation between the deterministic signal and random noise occurs at lower frequencies as the length increases . for low resonant frequency",
    "the particle is affected by the bias in a particular direction for a longer period of time before it suffers a change in the direction of bias , thus more probability to cover a large distance towards the boundary and at this resonant frequency the probability for reaching the boundary in a short time is maximum because if one increases the frequency more than the resonant frequency at that length , the flipping rate dominates and average time taken by the particle would be more .",
    "fig.5 demonstrates the lowering of the dispersion at resonant frequencies confirming that the cooperation is maximum at these frequencies .",
    "dispersion is more for higher lengths and as seen from the figure the dispersion merges to a specific value at very low frequency at various lengths .",
    "all the previous calculations are done when the particle starts initially from the mid point of the medium , i.e. , @xmath95 in eqs.(15 ) is taken as @xmath96 . at the length @xmath97 the resonant frequency is found to be 0.1 .",
    "the calculations are done one at resonant frequency and other two at the off- resonant frequencies ( @xmath98 and @xmath99 ) when the particle starts from @xmath100 where @xmath101 lies between 0 and 1.for zero frequency the mfpt can be analytically obtained .",
    "its expression reads as @xmath102)/(1-exp[-s_1\\lambda])]$ ] .",
    "the curves are shown in fig.6 .",
    "it is evident that the value of @xmath56 is less for resonant frequency ( curve @xmath78 ) than for its value for off - resonant frequencies(curves @xmath80 and @xmath103 ) . as frequency increases ,",
    "the maximum value of @xmath56 occurs at lower values of @xmath101 or , when the particle starts from the left of the interval .",
    "it is known that for pure diffusion the location of maximum @xmath56 would occur for @xmath104 .",
    "our signal starts with positive half - cycle and therefore the survival time of the particle would be more if the particle starts from the left of the interval .",
    "of course there would be some limit , because if it starts too much near the left end then diffusion towards the left boundary dominates and average time would be less .",
    "on the otherhand , if it starts from right half of the medium , the initial surge of the signal helps the particle to reach the boundary more quickly .",
    "hence average time of duration decreases .",
    "this fact is also in conformity with lattice simulation work@xcite , although most of the simulations in @xcite were obtained for an uniformly distributed initial condition .",
    "we next calculate the fptdf @xmath51 for various frequencies for @xmath105 and plot the curves in fig.7 .",
    "the resonant frequency for this length is found to be 0.1 . before the resonant frequency",
    "is reached , @xmath51 has got two distinct peaks [ fig.7a ] and at resonance two peaks merge to a single large peak .",
    "after the resonance many smaller peaks in @xmath51 gradually emerge as frequency increases more than the resonant frequency [ fig.7b ] .",
    "this is a general characteristic of csr .",
    "the height @xmath106 and the position @xmath107 of the first peak as a function of @xmath33 are plotted in curve @xmath78 of fig.8 .",
    "the figure shows that height of the first peak goes through a maximum as we increase the frequency while the position of that peak remains practically constant .",
    "the height reaches the maximum near the resonant frequency demonstrating that the probability of reaching the boundary is in short time is maximum near the resonant frequency .",
    "it is a kind of reflection of having @xmath56 minimum at that frequency .",
    "therefore it is a general characteristic of csr .",
    "the height and position of the second peak before the resonance are drawn as curve @xmath80 in fig.8 . at resonance",
    "the two peaks merge and we have only one peak . just after the resonance another peak starts developing and height increases as frequency increases further . the position and height of the second peak after resonance are plotted in curve @xmath103 of the same figure .",
    "the merging and the reappearance of the second peak is also observed as a brake or discontinuity of the dashed line in this figure .",
    "in this subsection we concentrate on the behaviour of the system at the resonance point .",
    "we have already discussed some general characteristics of csr in the previous subsection .",
    "we find that for each length , @xmath94 , a corresponding frequency @xmath108 exists for which @xmath56 and @xmath92 become minimum implying that the maximum cooperation between the deterministic periodic signal and random noise of the environment is taking place in helping the particle to reach the boundaries .",
    "one therefore would naturally inquire about the relation of @xmath108 with @xmath94 .",
    "the curve of @xmath108 as a function of @xmath94 is plotted in fig.9 . in the range of @xmath94",
    "we studied this curve is very well fitted with the formula @xmath109    the values of mfpt at resonance @xmath110 is plotted against the length @xmath94 in fig.10 and within the range of @xmath94 we consider the relation between them is fitted to @xmath111 of course , there will be deviation from this linear behaviour as @xmath94 decreases further because @xmath56 can not become negative and for @xmath112(corresponding to @xmath113 ) , @xmath56 should be zero .",
    "similarly the variance @xmath114 is plotted as a function of @xmath94 in fig.11 and within the range of @xmath94 we consider this curve is fitted to @xmath115 ^ 2 + b~,\\ ] ] with @xmath116 .",
    "we have already seen that at the resonance frequency we have one very dominant peak of fptdf , @xmath51[fig.7b ] . since it is a general feature , for each length @xmath94 we should get such behaviour .",
    "we further observe that @xmath108 varies inversely with @xmath94 ( eq.(19 ) ) .",
    "with this fact in our mind when we plot @xmath117 as a function of @xmath118 $ ] , we find that curves for all lengths superpose over each other [ fig.12 ] and the pattern of @xmath117 for different @xmath94 or @xmath108 is very similar , i.e. , at particular values of @xmath119 $ ] , all curves show their maxima , minima , and change in the behavioral patterns of the curves occur exactly at the same places of@xmath119 $ ] .",
    "similar characteristics are also observed in the curves of decay rate @xmath120 for different frequencies . for illustration",
    "we plot @xmath120 as a function of @xmath119 $ ] for three different lengths(@xmath97 ; curve @xmath78 , @xmath121 ; curve @xmath80 , @xmath122 ; curve @xmath103 ) , and present in fig.13 .",
    "therefore it shows that this feature is universal and @xmath119 $ ] or the cycle number is the correct variable to describe the resonance behaviour .",
    "we may further note that such scaling of fptdf would not be possible for any frequency other than the resonant frequencies because any frequency which is not the resonant frequency for one length may turn out to be the resonant frequency for some other length and the features of fptdf are different for resonant and off - resonant frequencies as has been observed from fig.7a - fig.7b .",
    "the major dominant peaks of fptdf @xmath117 for different lengths@xmath123 are drawn as a function of @xmath119 $ ] in fig.12 .",
    "there are no overlap of these curves which can be seen as we increase the resolution .",
    "the lowermost curve is for @xmath77 and as length increases the upper curves are generated .",
    "the peaks for all the curves occur nearly at a quarter of a cycle .",
    "the peak height @xmath124 and full width half maximum(fwhm ) for each curve is plotted as a function of resonant frequency .",
    "the plot is given in fig.14 .",
    "the plot shows that except for very low frequency they behave linearly with the resonant frequency .",
    "we have already seen that the cooperation between the deterministic signal and the random noise is maximum at the resonance point where mfpt @xmath56 variance @xmath92 take minimum values and corresponding fptdf @xmath51 shows a major dominant peak .",
    "what would happen when we change the frequency slightly above and below the resonant frequency ? to investigate the matter we choose a particular length of the medium , @xmath77 .",
    "the resonance frequency for such length , @xmath125 . for this particular length",
    "we take two off - resonant frequencies @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the curves for survival probabilities as a function of time @xmath16 are plotted in fig.15 , where the curves @xmath128 are for frequencies @xmath129 respectively .",
    "the calculation of survival probability is terminated when it takes value @xmath130 which corresponds to zero in our calculation .",
    "the curves clearly show that as frequency increases the survivality of the particle prolongs .",
    "this is quite understandable because more oscillations prevent the particle to reach the boundary , i.e. , for higher frequency we expect @xmath56 more .",
    "the oscillatory effect is more pronounced when time is large . for large time",
    "we always expect the value of @xmath131 more for higher frequency .",
    "this is clearly observed in fig.15 .",
    "but for frequency lower than the resonant frequency mfpt @xmath56 is again more .",
    "as mfpt is the integral of the survival probability over time , we expect a change in the behaviour of @xmath131 for lower time regime .",
    "this is shown explicitly in fig.16 . in this figure",
    "we find that the survival probability is more for low frequency , @xmath126 ( curve @xmath80 ) than for resonant frequency , @xmath132(curve @xmath78 ) and off - resonant frequency @xmath127(curve @xmath103 ) . especially for curve @xmath80 ,",
    "the value of @xmath133 is so much than that for curve @xmath78 , so that area under the curve @xmath80 is more than that for curve @xmath78 .",
    "we see that near about @xmath134 , the solid curve crosses the dashed curve .",
    "there is only one point of crossing throughout the entire time .",
    "we have already argued that after this crossing point oscillatory effect of this bias dominates .",
    "it is then clear for low time regime diffusion process competes over the oscillatory effect .",
    "again , for very low @xmath16 the chance of having increased value of the bias in the same direction is more for high frequency than for low frequency .",
    "therefore for low frequency the survivality is more than for the high frequency .",
    "the curves in fig.16 also demonstrate that .",
    "we have already demonstrated how @xmath110 varies with @xmath94 in fig.10 .",
    "the behaviour is linear with respect to the length of the medium .",
    "it is of interest whether the behaviour is changed for off - resonant frequency . for",
    "that we choose a frequency which is not the resonant frequency for the length @xmath94 that we consider in our calculation .",
    "the mfpt @xmath135 for that off - resonant frequency are calculated for different lengths and are plotted as a function of @xmath94 in fig.17 . for the range of length",
    "we consider the curve is fitted to @xmath136 with @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "we may note that this particular off - resonant frequency would be a resonant frequency for some length , @xmath139 , governed by the eq.(19 ) . in our case",
    "this off - resonant frequency corresponds to length @xmath140 .",
    "the curve shows that when @xmath141 , the rate of change of mfpt with respect to @xmath94 is more and when @xmath94 approaches @xmath139 or , when this frequency tends to be the resonant frequency , the rate is curbed . this could be a signature of approaching a coherent motion from the non - cooperative behaviour .",
    "we consider a diffusive transport process perturbed by a periodic signal in continuous one dimensional medium having two absorbing boundaries .",
    "no perturbation of the signal amplitude is assumed in this formulation .",
    "we showed explicitly that the cooperative behaviour between the deterministic periodic signal and random noise leading to coherent motion occurs when the time - dependent sinusoidal signal is approximated by a multistep periodic signal and not with single - step telegraph signal .",
    "although we study the process with three - step periodic signal , the formulation is quite general and applicable for any approximation with arbitrary number of steps .",
    "this formulation can also be applied to any arbitrary continuous periodic signal .",
    "it is observed that for large time oscillation of the signal plays a dominant role in the transport while in the low time regime frequency dependent bias force ( i.e.,the chance of having increased values of the bias in the same direction is more for high frequency than for low frequency ) has the key factor .",
    "for very high frequency the bias effect is practically absent and the motion is purely diffusive in nature . at the resonance the maximum cooperation between the noise and",
    "the periodic signal takes place .",
    "an important characteristic that we observe is that at the resonance the fptdf for various lengths have similar behaviour as a function of cycle number .",
    "there is only one dominant peak and the peak position occurs very near to a quarter of a cycle . from fig.12",
    "we observe a slight deviation of the peak positions but we believe that if the sinusoidal signal is approximated by more than three - step periodic signal the position of all the peaks will be the same .    there is also slight discrepancy in the position of the minimum of @xmath92 in comparison to the minima of @xmath56[fig.4,fig.5 ] .",
    "this may be due to the fact that all calculations are made to an end when the survival probability takes a value @xmath130 .",
    "we observe that if we cut off the calculations for more lower values of survival probability it does not affect mfpt but the variances are slightly affected . also if one approximates the sinusoidal signal better than three - step periodic signal one could obtain the positions of the minima of variances at exactly the same places as those with mfpt .",
