    "the sagittarius dwarf galaxy , discovered by ibata et al ( 1994 , 1995 ) , at a distance of only 25 kpc , offers a unique opportunity to study the stellar populations of an external galaxy .",
    "comparison of the color - magnitude diagram of sagittarius with those of galactic globular clusters has suggested a spread in metallicity in the range @xmath2 [ fe / h ] @xmath3 ( marconi et al 1998a ) .",
    "this may be the sign of a complex star - formation history characterized by several bursts . because sagittarius is some 16 kpc behind the galactic center there is confusion between sagittarius and bulge stars .",
    "sagittarius revealed itself as a population with a mean radial heliocentric velocity around 140 kms@xmath4 and a small velocity dispersion , thus probable membership may be ascribed on the basis of the radial velocity .",
    "intermediate resolution spectra allow to determine radial velocities with a precision around 20 kms@xmath4 , sufficient to confirm membership .",
    "moreover such low resolution spectra may be used to obtain a crude estimate of the metallicity which may be compared with the estimates based on the colour - magnitude diagrams . in this paper",
    "we report on radial velocities and abundances derived from grism spectra obtained with ntt+emmi / mos at eso la silla .",
    ".abundances and atmospheric parameters [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we used the multi - object - spectroscopy ( mos ) mode of the emmi instrument on the ntt 3.5 m telescope at eso la silla .",
    "the resolving power was about 1500 , the usable spectral range was from about 480 nm to about 620 nm .",
    "we acquired spectra of 57 stars , the log of the observations and further details may be found in marconi et al ( 1998b ) .",
    "the range 480 - 530 nm was used to determine heliocentric radial velocities using cross - correlation with synthetic spectra as templates we considered the stars with heliocentric radial velocities in the range 100 - 180 kms@xmath4 to be members of sagittarius , following ibata et al ( 1997 ) , this left us with a sample of 23 stars . in order to estimate abundances we defined six spectral indices which measure the mgb triplet and some fe and iron - peak elements features .",
    "we developed an iterative procedure which makes use of the synthe code ( kurucz 1993 ) to determine the abundances which best match the observed to the synthetic indices ; details may be found in marconi et al ( 1998b ) .",
    "the procedure requires that the atmospheric parameters t@xmath5 , log g and @xmath6 be fixed for each star .",
    "the colour @xmath7 of marconi et al ( 1998a ) was used to determine the effective temperatures using the calibration of alonso et al ( 1996 ) ; this calibration refers to dwarfs only , however it is theoretically known that the @xmath8 colour depends weakly on gravity ; we expect the error introduced by neglecting the gravity dependence of @xmath8 to be on the order of 100 k. the isochrones of straniero , chieffi & limongi ( 1997 ) for an age of 8 gyr and [ fe / h]@xmath9 were used to estimate log g. microturbulence can not be determined from this intermediate - resolution data , we therefore performed the computations for both 1 kms@xmath4 and 2 kms@xmath4 , these values cover the range usually found in cool giants and allow to estimate the effect of microturbulence on the derived abundances .",
    "this work is still in progress ; results for 8 out of the 23 stars with a radial velocity consistent with sagittarius membership , are presented in table 1 and displayed in figure 1 .",
    "our stars have been selected in order to highlight the spread in metallicity derived from the colour - magnitude diagram and in fact among the stars analyzed we see a spread of over one dex .",
    "however the metallicities range from super - solar to [ fe / h]@xmath10 , about 0.5 dex more metal - rich than the range implied by the photometry .",
    "a systematic error in the spectroscopic or photometric ( or both ! ) abundance estimates could reconcile the two results .",
    "however closer inspection of figure 1 reveals that of the 8 analyzed stars 3 are solar or super - solar while the remaining 5 show little or no dispersion in metallicity .",
    "it is legitimate to ask whether the metal - rich stars belong in fact to the bulge , in spite of their radial velocity .",
    "this hypothesis may not be ruled out , we note however that the [ mg / fe ] ratios appear to be solar or sub - solar .",
    "the large errors associated with our data preclude any firm conclusion , however , taken at face value , the [ mg / fe ] in our metal - rich stars appears to be different from the enhanced ratios displayed by the bulge k giants of mcwilliam & rich ( 1994 ) , figure 20a .",
    "our findings are in keeping with those of smecker - hane , mcwilliam & ibata ( 1998 ) , who , on the basis of keck hires spectra , found 2 out of 7 stars to be metal - rich and with @xmath11 elements o and ca under - abundant with respect to solar .",
