    "giant h  ii  regions contain numerous massive stars . in these regions",
    "we expect that supernova remnants ( snrs ) and stellar winds from the most massive stars will interact with interstellar gas to produce shocked , hot plasma that emits x - rays .",
    "indeed , bright diffuse x - ray emission has been detected in two nearby giant h  ii   regions : at levels of a few @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 in the carina nebula ( seward & chlebowski 1982 ; corcoran et al .",
    "1994 ) and @xmath3 erg s@xmath2 in the 30 doradus nebula ( chu & mac low 1990 , hereafter paper i ; wang & helfand 1991a ) . unfortunately",
    ", these giant h  ii  regions are so complex that it is difficult to understand their observed x - ray properties .",
    "it has been suggested that stellar winds alone power the x - ray emitting plasma in the carina nebula , since no classical snr signatures exist , and since the diffuse x - ray morphology roughly follows the distribution of early - type stars ( seward & chlebowski 1982 ; walborn & hesser 1982 ) .",
    "however , interstellar absorption observations show the presence of high - velocity gas at @xmath4v = @xmath5200 - 300 km s@xmath2 ( walborn 1982 ; walborn & hesser 1982 ) , and such large velocity offsets have otherwise only been seen in snrs ( jenkins , silk , & wallerstein 1976 ; fitzpatrick & savage 1983 ) .",
    "could there be hidden snrs producing both x - ray emission and high - velocity gas in the carina nebula ?",
    "the diffuse x - ray emission in 30 dor correlates well with its large shell structures , reminiscent of the isolated x - ray bright superbubbles described by paper i and by wang & helfand ( 1991b ) . in these x - ray bright superbubbles ,",
    "the observed x - ray luminosities exceed by as much as an order of magnitude the luminosities predicted by pressure - driven bubble models ( weaver et al .",
    "1977 ; paper i ) .",
    "the source of the x - ray emission has been proposed to be snrs hitting the shell walls ( paper i ; wang & helfand 1991b ) or mass - loaded snrs within the bubble ( arthur & henney 1996 ) .",
    "we have also identified superbubbles that are faint in x - rays , and found that the upper limits on their x - ray luminosities are consistent with those expected in pressure - driven bubble models ( chu et al .",
    "1995 , hereafter paper  iii ) .",
    "can we convincingly detect x - ray emission from superbubbles at levels predicted by pressure - driven bubble models ?",
    "an _ einstein _ high resolution imager ( hri ) observation of the core of 30 dor showed two point - like sources , each having an x - ray luminosity of nearly @xmath6 erg s@xmath2 ( wang & helfand 1991a ) .",
    "these two sources are projected near two tight clusters of massive stars , r136 and r140 ( walborn & seward 1989 ) ; however , the luminosities exceed those of stellar emission by at least 23 orders of magnitude . using recent _ rosat _ hri observations , wang ( 1995 ) identified mk34 ( 10@xmath7 from r136 ) and r140 as their optical counterparts and concluded that these x - ray sources are wolf - rayet + black hole binaries .",
    "do such sources always occur in similar tight clusters of massive stars ?    to help answer these questions , we have studied the lmc h  iicomplex n11 , the second - ranking h  ii  complex in the lmc ( kennicutt & hodge 1984 ) .",
    "n11 contains four ob associations : lh9 , 10 , 13 , and 14 ( lucke & hodge 1970 ) .",
    "lh9 is surrounded by a large superbubble , while lh10 , 13 , and 14 are embedded in bright , compact h  ii  regions along the periphery of the superbubble , designated as the b , c , and e components of n11 , respectively ( see figure  [ halpha ] ) .",
    "we have selected n11 for three reasons .",
    "first , the ob association lh10 within n11b contains several o3 stars similar to those in the ob associations in the carina nebula , but the surrounding h  ii  region n11b has no high - velocity gas indicative of possible hidden snrs .",
    "if the x - ray emission in the carina nebula comes only from hidden snrs , we would expect n11b to have a much lower x - ray luminosity .",
    "second , the large superbubble surrounding lh9 in n11 forms a good candidate to directly observe x - ray emission from a pressure - driven bubble .",
    "third , the tight core of the association lh9 , hd32228 , contains at least 16 early - type stars with the principal components being wc5 - 6 and o9.5ii ( parker et al .",
    "1992 ) , analogous to r136 or r140 in 30 dor , and so can be examined for point - like x - ray sources .",
    "n11 has recently been observed by rosado et al.(1996 ) using an imaging fabry - perot interferometer to map the velocity structure in h@xmath0  and [ o  iii ] lines .",
    "echelle spectroscopy in h@xmath0  along a n - s line cutting through the main shell of n11 was performed by meaburn et al .",
    "parker et al .",
    "( 1992 , 1996 ) studied the stellar content of the central associations of the main shell ( lh9 ) , and of n11b ( lh10 ) , and walborn & parker ( 1992 ) compared n11b to 30 dor .",
    "maps of co tracing molecular gas in the region have been presented by cohen et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , israel & de graauw ( 1991 ) , and caldwell ( 1996 ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we describe observations of n11 in the visible , ultraviolet , and x - ray wavelengths that we have obtained in order to better answer the questions raised above and understand the dynamics of this region . in  3 we define the x - ray source regions and describe the analysis of the x - ray data . in ",
    "4 we derive the x - ray luminosity predicted by the pressure - driven bubble model . in",
    " 5 we attempt to interpret the observations of the various parts of the n11 complex , and finally in  6 summarize our conclusions .",
    "we have observed n11 using a number of different techniques .",
    "the distribution of the denser , photoionized gas in shell walls and molecular cloud surfaces can be seen in optical emission - line images that we obtained using a ccd camera on the curtis schmidt telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) . in order to trace the hot gas produced by shocks in stellar wind bubbles or snrs , we used pointed x - ray observations with the _ rosat _ position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) and high resolution imager ( hri ) .",
    "the kinematics of the photoionized gas are revealed by high - dispersion , long - slit spectra obtained with an echelle spectrograph on the ctio 4 m telescope , and high - dispersion uv spectra obtained with the international ultraviolet explorer ( iue ) . in this section",
    ", we describe these observations .",
    "multiple optical ccd images of two fields of the n11 complex were obtained with the curtis schmidt telescope at ctio on 1995 january 28 .",

    "broader red and green filters ( @xmath15   , @xmath16    and @xmath17   , @xmath18   , respectively ) were used to obtain emission - line - free continuum images , which provide templates for continuum subtraction from the emission - line images .",
    "the data were reduced using the iraf software package for bias subtraction , flat - fielding , and sky subtraction .",
    "the images of the two fields were mosaicked after multiple frames in each field were shifted and combined .",
    "the total exposure times for each position in the final mosaicked images are 2700 s in h@xmath0 , 4800 s in [ s  ii ] , 3600 s in [ o  iii ] , 1800 s in the red continuum , and 1500 s in the green continuum .",

    "to analyze the pspc x - ray data , we first define source regions ( detailed in  3.1 ) , then extract the count rate and spectral energy distribution for each region .",
    "the observed spectral energy distribution is a convolution of the intrinsic spectrum , foreground absorption , and the instrumental response .",
    "the instrumental response of the rosat pspc is well calibrated .",
    "it is possible to fold the instrumental response into plasma emission models ( e.g. , raymond & smith 1977 ) and fit the results to the observed spectral energy distribution in order to determine the plasma temperature @xmath44 , foreground absorption @xmath30 , and x - ray luminosity @xmath45 .",

    "the number of counts received from our sources is usually too low to constrain the spectral fits well .",
    "therefore , we use other independent estimates of foreground absorption to confine the plasma temperature fits",
    ". the various methods we use to estimate absorption columns are described in detail below in   3.2 .",
    "the plasma temperature @xmath44 and the absorption column @xmath30 are then used to determine the intrinsic x - ray fluxes and luminosities .",
    "the best independently estimated log @xmath30 , the corresponding best - fit @xmath44 , and the resultant @xmath45 are listed in the bottom section of table 1 .",
    "when absorbing column densities are of order @xmath48 @xmath49 or higher , emission below about 0.5  kev is almost completely absorbed , even though _ rosat _ is sensitive down to 0.1 kev .",
    "the intrinsic luminosity in the 0.12.4 kev band is then dominated by the absorption correction in the 0.10.5 kev range , but virtually no photons are detected in this range , giving very uncertain results .",
    "we do give the luminosities derived for both 0.12.4 kev and 0.52.4 kev bands in table 1 .",
    "although we used the 0.12.4 kev band to find conservative upper limits for x - ray dim superbubbles in paper iii , the high luminosities given in table 1 from considering this full band in regions with high absorption appear unphysical .",
    "the luminosities derived from the 0.52.4 kev band are more physically meaningful .",
    "there is excellent correspondence between the x - ray emission and interstellar structures revealed in the h@xmath0  image .",
    "frequently , enhanced x - ray emission is seen within large shells .",
    "guided by the h@xmath0  image , we divide the x - ray emission from n11 into seven source regions , as shown in figure  [ hax ] and listed in table  [ spectra ] .",
    "four of these regions are associated with large shells .",

    "( 1996 ) performed fabry - perot observations of the entire n11 complex in both h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ] .",
    "they also found multiple components , but concluded that the main shell could best be described as undergoing a general radial expansion at 45  km  s@xmath2 , with lower density interior gas undergoing more rapid , cellular expansion .",
    "we now can find the luminosity predicted by the pressure - driven bubble theory .",
    "the typical emission measures of filaments around the edge of the bubble are in the range 600900 @xmath21  pc .",
    "we take the expansion velocity to lie in the range 4560 km  s@xmath2 . to find the physical radius of the bubble",
    ", we again use a distance to the lmc of 50 kpc ( panagia et al .",
    "1991 ) , so that @xmath100  pc .",
    "we then estimate the x - ray emitting bubble to have a radius @xmath1015565 pc .",
    "a pressure - driven bubble with these parameter ranges is predicted by equation  ( [ lx ] ) to have an x - ray luminosity @xmath102 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "this is a factor of 37 lower than the x - ray luminosity derived from the observations using constrained column densities : the main shell of n11 is somewhat x - ray bright .",
    "the excess x - ray emission is most likely produced by an intermittent source , since n11 represents an intermediate case between the bubbles we described in paper  iii that show no excess , and those we described in paper  i with excesses of more than an order of magnitude .",
    "arthur & henney ( 1996 ) suggested that an snr going off inside a bubble with embedded clumps could produce the excess .",
    "they ignored thermal evaporation of the clumps , suggesting that the evaporation could be suppressed by magnetic fields .",
    "tao ( 1995 ) has shown , however , that fields can not be tangled by dynamical means sufficiently to strongly suppress evaporation , so clumps would probably evaporate before being swept up by a snr .",
    "alternatively , we have suggested in paper  i that the excess x - ray emission is being produced as interior snrs expanding in the low - density gas hit the ionized inner edge of the swept - up shell .    using the same estimates of the observed parameters as above , we can examine the physical parameters of this bubble using equations  ( [ n0][mech ] ) .",
    "we find that the ambient density is 0.10.3  @xmath103 , a reasonable interstellar value .",
    "we note that there are clearly regions of far higher density in the ring around the main bubble , most noticeably traced by co observations showing a ring of molecular clouds roughly coincident with the regions of highest h@xmath0 intensity ( caldwell 1996 ; israel & de graauw 1991 ) . however , these regions appear to have a low enough filling factor to not be dynamically important .",
    "the mechanical luminosity driving the bubble ( eq .  [ [ mech ] ] ) lies in the range @xmath104  erg  s@xmath2 . using only the 18 o - type stars in lh9 that have been spectroscopically classified by parker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and using the empirical mass loss rates and stellar wind terminal velocities appropriate for the spectral types ( conti & underhill 1988 ) , we derive an integrated wind mechanical luminosity of 3.3@xmath810@xmath105 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "it is conceivable that the wc5 - 6 star in hd32228 and other unclassified early type stars in lh9 could supply the @xmath89 required to drive shell 1 .",
    "the total input energy @xmath106 in such a bubble is then ( 0.61.2)@xmath107  erg , just allowing the small number of supernovae suggested by rosado et al .",
    "( 1996 ) from detailed modeling of the imf .",
    "note that the possible hidden snr producing the excess x - ray emission would not yet have fully transferred its energy to the shell , and so would currently make only a small contribution to the quoted input energy .",
    "the kinetic energy of the shell , from equation  ( [ ke ] ) , is @xmath108 erg .",
    "this model is definitely inconsistent with the dozens of supernovae suggested by meaburn et al .",
    "( 1989 ) based on the overall sn rate in the lmc and the size of the shell .",
    "the age of the bubble is more problematic . from equation  ( [ t6 ] ) and",
    "the above estimates of radius and expansion velocity , we find ages of 0.50.8  myr , well below the age of the central ob association .",
    "another way of looking at it is that this bubble is expanding much too fast to have been produced by such an old ob association .",
    "oey ( 1996 ) has demonstrated that this same phenomenon occurs in a number of superbubbles where the age of the central ob association has been measured .",
    "a possible solution to this problem may be that the expansion of the superbubble in a relatively low density medium only occurs after it has broken out of its parent molecular cloud , well after the formation of the central ob association .",
    "the association lh  10 in the nebula n11  b , which we discuss next , may in fact be an example of just such an association that has formed , but has not yet broken out into the low density medium and produced a clear supershell .",
    "this suggestion supposes that the boundary between dense molecular cloud and diffuse ism is significantly steeper than the @xmath109 power law that oey ( 1996 ) examined .",
    "further modeling of the process of superbubble breakout from molecular clouds appears useful .",
    "an unconstrained spectral fit to this region gives a range in column density @xmath110 and temperature @xmath111  kev .",
    "constraining the absorbing column density independently , we find more reasonable values of @xmath11221.3 - 21.6 and @xmath1130.40.5  kev .",
    "this corresponds to an x - ray luminosity @xmath114 erg s@xmath2 .    in order to estimate the x - ray emission contributed by ob stars in the central cluster lh  9 , we first convert v band fluxes of the 24 o and b stars located in a 4 arcmin@xmath115 region centered on hd  32228 into bolometric magnitude ( @xmath116 ) by applying reddening ( parker et al . 1992 ) and bolometric ( chlebowski & garmany 1991 ) corrections .",
    "we then convert the summed @xmath117 to x - ray luminosity by the relation @xmath118 , which is good for stars of types between o3 and a5 ( pallavincini et al .",
    "1981 ; chlebowski , harnden , & sciortino 1989 ) .",
    "the overall stellar x - ray luminosity @xmath45 is 5@xmath810@xmath119 erg s@xmath2 , which is 617% of the observed x - ray luminosity in n11  b.    figures  [ echimage](b ) and [ echimage](c ) show two echellograms of the n11  b region .",
    "the two slit positions are in a cross roughly centered on n11  b , as shown in figure  [ halpha](c ) and described in   [ ech ] .",
    "they show well - resolved , remarkably gaussian line profiles , with fwhm of 3040  km  s@xmath2 , far broader than the instrumental profile .",
    "figure  [ echn11b ] shows an example of one of these profiles at one of the few places where a high - velocity shoulder might be visible on the line .",
    "other than this shoulder , the lines appear quite featureless , and completely lack high - velocity emission at velocities greater than 100  km  s@xmath2 .",
    "the carina nebula resembles n11b in stellar content , both containing several o3 stars .",
    "a major difference between them is that the carina nebula shows an expanding shell structure in velocity and shows high - velocity gas at velocity offsets of several hundred km s@xmath2 ( walborn 1982 ; walborn & hesser 1982 ) , while n11b appears to have neither of these two dynamic features .",
    "the heating mechanism for the x - ray emitting gas in carina could be either stellar winds or snrs .",
    "the lack of a visible ring structure in n11b suggests that it contains no large cavity of hot gas .",
    "this makes it difficult to hide an snr in the region . a supernova going off in a region with density greater than 0.1",
    "@xmath103 will generate classical snr signatures ( tomisaka , habe , & ikeuchi 1981 ) .",
    "we can find a lower bound to the density in n11b by assuming that it is a uniform , ionized sphere .",
    "the emission measure in h@xmath0 is @xmath120  @xmath21  pc , and the diameter of the region is 27 pc , yielding an electron density of @xmath121 @xmath103 .",
    "an snr expanding into gas this dense would produce fireworks , in the form of the classical snr signatures , none of which are observed .",
    "lh 10 contains between three and six o3 stars ( parker et al .",
    "1992 ) , suggesting that the cluster is extremely young , and adding further weight to the suggestion that no snr has occurred yet .",
    "if stellar winds do produce the observed x - ray emission , however , the question arises of why no clear stellar wind bubbles can be seen in n11b .",
    "a pressure - driven bubble would have a radius of ( weaver et al .",
    "1977 ) @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the mass - loss rate of the stellar wind in units of @xmath124yr , @xmath125 is the stellar wind velocity in units of 2000 km s@xmath2 , and @xmath126 is the age of the bubble in units of @xmath127 yr . substituting a density of @xmath128 @xmath103 and setting the other values to unity gives a bubble of radius 14 pc , or nearly an arcminute at the distance of the lmc . indeed , rosado et al .",
    "( 1996 ) suggest a structure of overlapping bubbles based on their fabry - perot observations of the region in h@xmath0 and [ o  iii ] .",
    "they found moderately broad h@xmath0 lines , consistent with our echelle observations , as might be expected from many overlapping bubbles , and found that the narrower [ o  iii ] lines showed splitting indicative of small bubbles in some regions .",
    "our h@xmath0 image also shows some structure suggestive of overlapping bubbles ; this can be seen even more clearly in the h@xmath0 image of n11  b shown in walborn & parker ( 1992 ) .",
    "we have been awarded time to perform high - resolution imaging with the hubble space telescope that may resolve this structure more clearly .",
    "axaf imaging may reveal whether x - ray emission is confined to the interiors of such small wind - blown bubbles .",
    "shell 2 lies on the north edge of n11  b. in h@xmath0 emission , the shell appears elongated in the n - s direction , with a diameter of approximately @xmath129 in that direction .",
    "however , the combination of the x - ray image and echelle spectroscopy by meaburn et al .",
    "( 1989 ) shows a different picture .",
    "x - rays are only emitted in the southern third of the bubble ( see figure  [ hax ] ) .",
    "spectral fits with constrained absorption give a @xmath44 range 0.30.4  kev and an x - ray luminosity of @xmath130 erg s@xmath2 in the 0.52.4  kev band .",
    "this region also turns out to show a line splitting of @xmath131 km  s@xmath2 in the echelle spectrum .",
    "the region without x - ray emission also shows no line - splitting in h@xmath0 .",
    "thus the x - ray emission is associated with a kinematically distinct structure of unknown origin .",
    "shell 3 lies adjacent to shell 2 , north of the main bubble and nw of n11  b. a @xmath44 range 0.10.5  kev and an x - ray luminosity range of ( 0.70.9 ) @xmath1 erg s@xmath2 are derived from the constrained @xmath30 fits .",
    "there is no clear boundary between the x - ray emission in the southern region of shell  2 and that of shell  3 , although the h@xmath0 morphology suggests that they are separate structures .",
    "the x - ray emission from shell  3 actually extends further to the west , possibly even merging with the plume of emission north of the snr n11",
    "l. spectroscopy of the region would be needed to further understand the relation among these structures .",
    "shell 4 lies south of the main bubble .",
    "even the unconstrained fit shown in figure  [ gridplots ] is quite close to the independently derived constraints on @xmath30 .",
    "spectral fits with constrained absorption give a @xmath44 range 0.30.5  kev and an x - ray luminosity range of ( 0.971.2)@xmath99 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "it is perhaps most remarkable in that it appears quite similar in h@xmath0 morphology to the shell immediately to its e , and yet has detectable x - ray emission , while the other shell does not . in the absence of any kinematical information from spectroscopy",
    ", we can only suggest that intermittent events such as hidden supernovae might produce such a pattern .",
    "x - ray emission is observed in the pspc map peaking at the position of the bright cluster hd 32228 ( ra 04@xmath1325 ; dec @xmath133 ; j2000 ) in the center of the main n11 shell ( marked in figure 1(a ) ) .",
    "however , no x - ray emission is seen in the hri observation over 3 @xmath24 or @xmath134 counts s@xmath2 .",
    "this indicates that the x - ray luminosity from any point source associated with hd 32228 is below an upper limit of @xmath135 4 @xmath136 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "the observed pspc count rate within the 4 arcmin@xmath115 region is @xmath137 counts s@xmath2 .",
    "if we take the absorbing column density and local plasma temperature to be roughly the same as elsewhere in shell  1 ( @xmath138 k , and @xmath139 , from table  1 ) , the observed x - ray luminosity is @xmath140 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "following the same procedure used in   [ n11b ] , we estimate the stellar x - ray luminosity to be @xmath141 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , the stellar x - ray emission accounts for only @xmath23 30% of the observed @xmath45 , and the remaining emission is from the hot gas .",
    "hd  32228 does not appear to contain a compact object similar to those observed near r136 and r140 in 30 dor ( wang 1995 ) , showing that such x - ray sources are not universally associated with tight clusters such as this .",
    "the h@xmath0 image shows faint filaments extending above shell  2 to the nw , associated with diffuse x - ray emission , as well as with an unidentified x - ray point source , all lying within the box labeled nw  diffuse in figure  [ hax ] .",
    "the spectrum of the point source suggests it is a galactic foreground star .",
    "its point nature has also been verified by its spatial profile in the hri image .",
    "therefore , x - ray emission from the point source is subtracted from the total pspc flux .",
    "spectral fits to the remaining emission with constrained absorption give a @xmath44 of 0.3  kev in this region , and an x - ray luminosity range of @xmath142 erg s@xmath2 .",
    "similar diffuse x - ray emission has been observed outside the major structures visible in h@xmath0 in n44 ( paper  ii ) and 30  dor ( chu 1996 ) .",
    "the x - ray emission in this region is dominated by a weak , point - like source .",
    "spectral fitting suggests a temperature of around 1 kev and a low absorption column density of @xmath143 .",
    "these properties are consistent with a galactic stellar source in the solar neighborhood .",
    "unfortunately , we can not confirm the point nature of this source , as it has luminosity below the detection limit of our hri observation .",
    "\\1 . the main bubble of n11 , surrounding the ob association lh 9 , has an x - ray luminosity of @xmath144 erg s@xmath2 , a factor of 37 times higher than the prediction of an energy - conserving , pressure - driven superbubble model .",
    "this could be the result of an snr hitting the inner edge of the shell ( paper  i ) , or of a mass - loaded snr in the interior ( arthur & henney 1996 ) . both of these processes should produce intermittent and time - dependent excesses of x - ray emission over the prediction of the pressure - driven model .",
    "indeed , the x - ray emission from the main bubble of n11 is only slightly above the predicted value , and the bubbles of paper iii all have upper limits on their luminosities consistent with the prediction .",
    "it remains true that no superbubble has yet been positively detected emitting with luminosity within a factor of three of the prediction of the pressure - driven model , although the limits are narrowing .",
    "diffuse x - ray emission is detected from n11  b , a region analogous to the carina nebula with multiple o3 and other massive stars .",
    "the luminosity greatly exceeds that expected from the stars themselves , as in carina .",
    "although no single bubble is observed , echelle observations show strongly supersonic motions , h@xmath0 images show hints of overlapping shell structures , and the fabry - perot observations of [ o  iii ] by rosado et al .",
    "( 1996 ) show line splitting in some regions .",
    "no gas moving at velocities over 60  km  s@xmath2 is seen however , suggesting a lack of snrs .",
    "thus we conclude that the diffuse x - ray emission could be powered solely by stellar winds from the central massive stars of lh  10 .",
    "the application to carina is , unfortunately , less than incisive .",
    "an absence of emission from n11b in excess of stellar emission would have been strong support for the suggestion that hidden snrs produce the x - ray emission in carina , because the clusters are otherwise similar .",
    "however , the presence of bright x - ray emission from n11b does not argue against hidden snrs in carina , because of the presence of high - velocity gas in carina and the absence of such gas in n11b .",
    "the dynamical age of the main shell of n11 is under 1 myr , significantly shorter than the age derived by parker et al .",
    "( 1992 ) for the central cluster , lh  9 .",
    "this same problem has been found for other superbubbles by oey ( 1996 ) .",
    "we propose that the solution to this problem is that during the initial evolution of ob associations , they remain cocooned within their high - density parent molecular clouds , and do not begin generating the observed superbubbles until after they have broken out of the dense clouds into the surrounding diffuse ism .",
    "n11  b may be an example of a young ob association with energetic winds that has not yet broken out of a high - density region , since despite the presence of o3 stars and x - ray emission , very little high - velocity gas is observed , while co is still observed towards this region .",
    "the tight cluster hd  32228 in lh  9 is not a strong x - ray source , despite its resemblance in stellar density and size to the clusters r136 and r140 in 30 dor .",
    "this suggests that the strong x - ray emission observed from r136 and r140 is not an intrinsic property of tight stellar clusters , but is rather generated by a compact object that has formed there , as suggested by wang ( 1995 ) .",
