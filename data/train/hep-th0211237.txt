    "recently there is great interest in the study of the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray ( uhecr ) and the tev - photon paradoxes .",
    "the first paradox is that some experiments @xcite-@xcite observed many hundreds of events with energies above @xmath1ev and about 20 events above @xmath2ev which are above the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) threshold . in principle , photopion production with the microwave background radiation photons should decrease the energies of these protons to the level below the corresponding threshold .",
    "the second paradox is the fact that experiments detected 20tev photons from mrk 501 ( a bl lac object at a distance of 150mpc ) .",
    "similarly to the first case , due to the interaction with the ir background photons , the 20tev photons should have disappeared in the ground - based detections .",
    "these two puzzles have a common feature that both of them can be seen as some threshold anomalies : energy of an expected threshold is reached but the threshold is not observed .",
    "there are numerous solutions such as @xcite proposed for the uhecr and the tev-@xmath3 paradoxes . in particular",
    ", most authors @xcite-@xcite have suggested that lorentz - invariance violation can be the origin of these anomalies and have obtained many developments .    in this paper",
    ", we try to deal with these paradoxes by a modified dispersion relation which is obtained from @xmath0-deformed noncommutative theory .",
    "it is well - known that noncommutative geometry @xcite plays an important role in the trans - planck physics , therefore , for phenomena related to the ultrahigh energy physics such as these two paradoxes , it is more reasonable to consider the lorentz - invariance violation is from noncommutative geometry and make some explanations for them in the background of noncommutative theory . the possibility has been mentioned that noncommutative geometry may be responsible for the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray and tev - photon paradoxes in some papers@xcite . here through a complete process based on a brand - new method which is from @xmath0-deformed noncommutative theory",
    ", we will connect threshold anomalies with noncommutative theory to not only unravel these threshold anomalies but also present a strong support for noncommutative theory in turn .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : we derive a general modified dispersion relation from @xmath0-deformed noncommutative theory in section 2 . in the following section we will apply this dispersion relation to the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray and the tev - photon paradoxes , and with the observed energies we get a common region of the ( @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 ) parameter space to resolve these two anomalies . in section 4",
    ", we will give some implications and remarks for our work .",
    "therefore , from @xcite , we can directly get : @xmath15_q-[\\widehat{1-n}]_q\\right).\\ ] ] applying ( [ fer - n - p ] ) to ( [ fermi - h - n ] ) , we can obtain @xmath16_q-\\left[\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{\\sqrt{m^2+p^2}}{\\omega}\\right]_q\\right).\\ ] ]      expand the right hand side of ( [ q - fermi - dispersion ] ) and ( [ q - bose - dispersion ] ) in the neighborhood of @xmath23 to the second order , we derive the common approximate deformed dispersion relation for a fermion and a boson : @xmath24",
    "now we will compute the @xmath0-deformed threshold for the uhecrs and the tev - photons .",
    "we consider the head - on collision between a soft photon of energy @xmath25 , momentum @xmath26 and a high energy particle of energy @xmath27 , momentum @xmath28 , which leads to the production of two particles with energies @xmath29 , @xmath30 and momenta @xmath31 , @xmath32 respectively @xcite . from the energy conservation and momentum conservation",
    ", we have : @xmath33 @xmath34 in the c. o. m. frame , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are rest at threshold , so they have the same velocity in the lab frame .",
    "it s easy to give the following equation : @xmath37 applying our resulting dispersion relation ( [ q - dispersion ] ) and ( [ p3p2 ] ) to ( [ threshold1 ] ) and ( [ threshold2 ] ) , we can obtain the expression for @xmath38 in this case : @xmath39 in the course of deriving ( [ q - threshold ] ) , we have used the simplified form of ( [ q - dispersion ] ) : @xmath40 @xmath41 while in the non - deformed case , the threshold has the form as below : @xmath42 hereafter , we will denote the @xmath43 in the non - deformed case and in the @xmath0-deformed case by @xmath44 and @xmath38 separately .    in the uhecr paradox @xmath45 , we set @xmath46 , in the other one @xmath47 , we have @xmath48 and similarly set @xmath49 .",
    "inputting the values of @xmath43 in @xcite @xmath50 and @xmath51 to ( [ q - threshold ] ) and ( [ nq - threshold ] ) respectively , we can get two curves for the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 as plotted in fig .",
    "1 ( the unit of @xmath4 is mev ) .",
    "figure 1 : * the region of parameter space *    the region of the @xmath52 parameter space provides a solution to both the uhecr and the tev-@xmath3 threshold anomalies .",
    "while applying the @xmath0-deformed dispersion relation to the present observed anomalies , the relation between @xmath4 and @xmath5 can be described by the two curves in fig .",
    "1 which give the lower bound on the @xmath0-deformation . in the region below both of the curves , the uhecr and the tev - photon paradoxes are resolved together .",
    "the top left corner is excluded , which is easily understood for at a fixed @xmath4 the conventional dispersion relation can be reproduced if we take @xmath53 . under the consideration of @xmath54 mev , the parameters must be within the shaded area .",
    "@xmath54 mev is set according to the smallness of @xmath5 , which is the requirement of the @xmath0-deformed noncommutative theory .",
    "the relation between the two parameters @xmath4 and @xmath0 depends strongly on the experimental input . in this paper",
    "we just made use of the highest energies of the ultrahigh energy cosmic rays and the tev - photons arriving on earth observed so far .",
    "because both threshold anomalies of the uhecrs and the mrk 501 tev - photons are still under the situation that the data should be proceeded very cautiously , our resulting relation of the parameters is to be tested . if in the future better data prove the assumption of these threshold anomalies is incorrect , the explanation for them in terms of the @xmath0-deformed noncommutative theory has to be excluded , the same case as other interpretations such as the quantum - gravity - motivated models @xcite will encounter . if , however , the threshold anomalies are confirmed , the enhanced constraints on the available region of the parameter space can result from future cosmic - ray observations and experiments performed at very high engines .    on the other hand , it has long been recognized that cosmology is a natural laboratory for testing the possible theories of extremely high energy physics such as string theory and noncommutative theory , and many authors @xcite have tried to search for some supports for these theories from the cosmological observations and experiments directly or indirectly .",
    "one purpose of this paper is also following this train of thought , and if it can be verified that the permitted region of the parameter space to resolve the threshold anomalies is coincident with the parameter range from the noncommutative theory , it will be more confident for us to consider the noncommutative theory as the suitable theory for the trans - planck physics .        999 m. takeda _",
