    "the renormalization group ( rg ) methods have been widely used to the analysis of fully developed hydrodynamic ( hd ) turbulence beginning from pioneering papers @xcite based on @xcite .",
    "it gives possibility to reply upon some principal questions , e.g. , on the fundamental description of the infrared ( ir ) scale invariance , as well as it is useful for calculation of many quantities , e.g. , critical dimensions of the fields and their gradients , viscosity , etc .",
    "( see , e.g. @xcite ) .    then many authors begin to use wilson s scheme or some adequate generalized renormalization scheme to study of hd turbulence @xcite as well as of magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence @xcite .",
    "this time vasiliev s team have used functional formulation of the field - theoretic rg @xcite to legalize of the kolmogorov scaling regime of hd turbulence @xcite .",
    "they consider ( as used in present paper ) the functional quantum field rg approach @xcite rather then wilson s rg technique @xcite .",
    "it assigns a field action to the stochastic problem and makes possible to use elegant and very well developed rg procedure in quantum field theory to investigate infrared asymptotic regimes of a stochastic system .",
    "then this rg method has been applied in mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "note here that this functional rg method allow a straightforward extension of the pertubative calculation to an higher order loops without a principal difficulty ( see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "considerable effort had been devoted to application of adequate field - theoretical methods in the mhd turbulence ( see recent review of verma @xcite , for example ) .",
    "authors in @xcite have used the classical yakhot - orszag scheme @xcite . in last years",
    "verma @xcite performed detailed rg calculation of mdh turbulence using mccomb s alternative field - theoretic rg procedure @xcite and they reached notable progress in calculation of some renormalized parameters of mhd turbulence . here",
    "we will not present full discussion of all methods used in the full developed turbulence theory such as calculation of alfven ratio , magnetic resistivity @xcite or a problem of magnetic dynamo in helicit mhd @xcite because it goes out of the frame of present paper ( but see some remarks and discussion in section 4 and section 5 ) .",
    "present paper deals with an investigation of the existence and range of stability of the magnetic scaling regime ( i.e. the magnetic fixed point for zero inverse prandtl number , see below ) in the non - helical @xmath0-dimensional mhd turbulence .",
    "the existence of two different anomalous scaling regimes in three dimensions , which are known as kinetic and magnetic ones , was established in the pioneering papers @xcite .",
    "these two points correspond to two ir stable fixed points of the rg . on the other hand ,",
    "it was also supposed that in two dimensions the magnetic fixed point does not exist as a result of nonexistence of the ir stable magnetic fixed point .",
    "but the conclusions about two dimensional fixed points can not be consider without doubts in these papers due to the problems with renormalization in two dimensions which were not taken into account @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . in @xcite two dimensional case",
    "was studied too but again with shortcomings , therefore their results can not be considered completely conclusive . within the our field",
    "theoretic rg approach the problem is related to the existence of additional divergences which arise in two dimensions .",
    "the first correct treatment of the two dimensional case of the stochastically forced mhd equations with the proper account of these additional divergences was done in @xcite .",
    "it was accomplished within a two - parameter expansion ( double expansion ) of scaling exponents and scaling functions @xcite where , besides the parameter which characterize the deviation of the exponent of the powerlike correlation function of random forcing from its critical value , the additional parameter of the deviation of the spatial dimension was introduced .",
    "the using of this double expansion method has allowed them to confirm the basic conclusions of the previous works @xcite , namely , the nonexistence of the magnetic scaling regime near two dimensions .",
    "the authors of the paper @xcite also tried to restore the stability of the magnetic fixed point when moving from two dimensions in direction of three dimensions .",
    "this possibility was achieved by using of the special choice of finite renormalization which allowed them to keep track of the effect of the additional divergences near two dimensions .",
    "technically , it was done by introducing of another uniform uv cutoff in all propagators which does not affect the large - scale properties of the model .",
    "this setup is similar to that of polchinski @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the borderline dimension between stable and unstable magnetic fixed point was found and it leads to the possibility of the uniform description of two and three dimensional cases of stochastic mhd .    another possibility how to solve the problem of the additional divergences in two dimensions together with the problem of restoration of the stability of the corresponding fixed point when going from a two dimensional system to a three dimensional one was proposed in @xcite .",
    "they suggest to apply a modified minimal substraction ( ms ) scheme in which the @xmath0-dependence of the tensor structures of the uv divergent parts of the corresponding diagrams are kept .",
    "it was successfully used in the fully developed navier - stokes turbulence with weak uniaxial anisotropy to restore the stability of the kolmogorov scaling regime which is unstable in two dimensions and stable in three dimensions .    in what follows",
    ", we shall apply the double expansion method together with modified ms scheme introduced in @xcite to the stochastic mhd equations .",
    "our aim is to investigate if it is possible to describe correctly and uniformly the two dimensional and the three dimensional systems and to compare our results with that of @xcite where the different method was used ( see above ) .",
    "thus , we carry out an analysis of the randomly forced mhd equations with the proper account of the additional uv divergences which are appeared in @xmath2 . we apply a modified minimal subtraction scheme based on the fact that the tensor structure of counter - terms is left generally @xmath0-dependent in the calculations of divergent parts of green s functions .",
    "it will be shown that it allows us to investigate behavior of the system under continual transition to @xmath3 beginning from @xmath2 .",
    "we have also confirmed the earlier conclusions made in @xcite that near two dimensions a scaling regime driven by the velocity fluctuations may exist , but no magnetically driven scaling regime can occur .",
    "we have also investigated the long - range asymptotic behavior of the model in the double expansion framework and found , in particular , that in this case thermal fluctuations of the magnetic scaling regime may occur and that the value of the borderline dimension is significantly lower ( @xmath6 ) than in the @xmath5 expansion @xcite ( @xmath9 ) and rather lower than in the modified double expansion introduced in @xcite ( @xmath10 ) but it is rather higher then value ( @xmath11 ) calculated in the frame of the mccomb s renormalization @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the value of inverse prandtl number @xmath12 which corresponds to nontrivial stable fixed point of the rg in the three dimensions , which has been obtained in the double expansion scheme in earlier paper @xcite and that obtained by the usual @xmath5-expansion scheme @xcite and also that obtained by verma @xcite by mccomb s procedure , was one more reason of the present analysis .",
    "here we show that the continuous transition from the universal value of the inverse prandtl number @xmath1 determined at @xmath2 restores the value of @xmath4 at @xmath3 which is known from usual @xmath5-expansion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec2 ] the functional field theoretic formulation of the model is present in detail . in section  [ sec3 ] the renormalization of the model is discussed . in section  [ sec4 ] detailed analysis of the possible scaling regimes is done . in section  [ sec5 ] conclusions and discussion of the results are given .",
    "in the present paper we study the universal statistical features of the model of stochastic mhd which is described by the system of equations for the fluctuating velocity field of an incompressible conducting fluid @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the magnetic induction @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 is density of the fluid and @xmath18 is its permeability ) @xcite : @xmath19 with the incompressibility conditions @xmath20 and @xmath21 and the field @xmath22 is suppose to be solenoidal too , @xmath23 .",

    "for example , it was not taken into account in the analysis of the model in @xcite .    using the well - known martin - siggia - rose formalism @xcite",
    ", one can transform the stochastic problem ( [ nsr])-([magnet ] ) with correlators ( [ corelv ] ) , and ( [ corelb ] ) into the field theoretic model of the doubled set of fields @xmath42 with the following action functional @xmath43 where @xmath44 , and @xmath45 are independent of @xmath24 , and @xmath22 auxiliary incompressible fields , which we have to introduce when transforming the stochastic problem into a functional form .    the dimensional constants @xmath46 , and @xmath40 , which control the amount of randomly injected energy given by ( [ corelv ] ) , ( [ corelb ] ) , play the role of the coupling constants in the perturbative expansion . for the convenience of further calculations the factors @xmath47 and @xmath48 including the `` bare '' ( molecular ) viscosity @xmath27 and the `` bare '' ( molecular or microscopic ) magnetic inverse prandtl number @xmath28 have been extracted . as was mentioned already the bare ( non - renormalized ) quantities are denoted by subscript `` 0 '' .",
    "the most important measurable quantities in the study of a fully developed turbulence and related problems are considered to be the statistical objects represented by correlation and response functions ( green functions ) of the fields .",
    "standardly , the formulation through the action functional ( [ action ] ) replaces the statistical averages of random quantities in the stochastic problem ( [ nsr])-([corelb ] ) with equivalent functional averages with weight @xmath49 .",
    "generating functionals of total green functions g(a ) and connected green functions w(a ) are then defined by the functional integral @xmath50 where @xmath51 represents a set of arbitrary sources for the set of fields @xmath52 , @xmath53 denotes the measure of functional integration , and linear form @xmath54 is defined as @xmath55.\\label{form}\\ ] ]    the functional formulation gives the possibility of using the field theoretic methods , including the rg technique to solve the problem . by means of the rg approach it is possible to extract large - scale asymptotic behavior of the correlation functions after an appropriate renormalization procedure which is needed to remove uv divergences .",
    "the functional formulation is advantageous also because the green functions of the fourier - decomposed stochastic mhd can be calculated by means of feynman diagrammatic technique .",
    "action ( [ action ] ) is given in a form convenient for a realization of the field theoretic perturbation analysis with the standard feynman diagrammatic technique .",
    "free ( bare ) propagators @xmath56 can be found from the quadratic part of the action ( [ action ] ) written in the form @xmath57 and by using the definition @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes the diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are the transverse projectors ( our fields are solenoidal ) .",
    "one obtains @xmath60 with the elements ( wave - number - frequency representation ) @xmath61    the model has three triple ( interaction ) vertices @xmath62&=&b^{\\prime}_j u_{jkl } b_k v_l\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the tensor structure of the vertices in wave - number - frequency representation are @xmath63 where momentum @xmath64 is flowing into the vertex via the auxiliary fields @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that for any fixed space dimension @xmath65 , the superficial uv divergences can exit only in the following one - particle irreducible ( 1pi ) green functions : @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "they lead to local counterterms of the form @xmath68 , @xmath69 , and @xmath70 which are already present in the action ( [ action ] ) , therefore , the model is multiplicatively renormalizable ( the analytic terms in @xmath41 proportional to @xmath39 , and @xmath39 in ( [ corelv ] ) , and ( [ corelb ] ) are not needed in this case , and the model can be formulated without them ) .",
    "the situation is more complicated in the two dimensional case , where additional uv divergences appear .",
    "they are related to the 1pi green functions @xmath71 , and @xmath72 . in this situation",
    "the formulation of the model without local ( analytic in @xmath41 ) terms can not give , in general , multiplicatively renormalizable model because the nonlocal terms of the action is not renormalized since the divergences produced by the loop integrals of the diagrams are always local in space and time ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , the simplest way how to restore the renormalizability of the model ( or how to include the corresponding local counterterms @xmath73 , and @xmath74 in the renormalization ) is to add corresponding local terms to the force correlation functions .",
    "it is shown explicitly in ( [ corelv ] ) , and ( [ corelb ] ) . in language of classical hydrodynamics",
    "the forcing contribution @xmath75 corresponds to the appearance of large eddies convected by small and active ones and it is represented by the local term of @xmath76 . in its analogy",
    "the term @xmath77 is added to the magnetic forcing .",
    "thus , in two dimensions , the model ( [ action ] ) is renormalizable by the standard power - counting rules , and for limits @xmath78 possesses the ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences which are present in five aforementioned 1pi green functions .",
    "it means that model is regularized using a combination of analytic and dimensional regularization with the parameters @xmath5 , and @xmath37 . as a result",
    ", the uv divergences appear as poles in @xmath5 , @xmath79 , and their following combinations : @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "the uv divergences may be removed by adding needed counterterms to the basic action @xmath82 which is obtained from the unrenormalized one ( [ action ] ) by the substitution of the renormalized parameters for the bare ones : @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , where @xmath18 is a scale - setting parameter having the same canonical dimension as the wave number .    in what follows , we shall work with , in our case the most convenient , minimal subtraction ( ms ) scheme , i.e. , we are interesting only in the singular ( pole ) parts of divergent 1pi green functions which are included in the renormalization constants .",

    "puts @xmath2 in @xmath151 , therefore the d - dependence of these multipliers is ignored . as was discussed in @xcite , for the theories with vector fields and , consequently , with tensor diagrams , where the sign of values of fixed points and/or their stability depend on the dimension @xmath0 , the procedure , which eliminates the dependence of multipliers of the type @xmath151 on @xmath152 is not completely correct because one is not able to control the stability of the fixed point when @xmath153 therefore , in @xcite it was proposed to slightly modify the ms scheme in such a way to keep the d - dependence of @xmath154 in renormalization constants @xmath155 . then the subsequent calculations of the rg functions ( @xmath156 functions and anomalous dimensions @xmath157 ) allow one to arrive at the results which are in qualitative agreement with the results obtained in the framework of the simple analytical regularization scheme , i.e. , one is able to obtain the fixed point which is not stable for @xmath2 , but whose stability is restored for a borderline dimension @xmath158 . in what follows",

    "we have shown in ( [ gamad2 ] ) that in two dimensions the function @xmath223 vanishes and then both functions @xmath224 and @xmath225 contain the same linear combination of @xmath104 functions .",
    "thus , at least one of the magnetic charges ( @xmath226 must be zero in fixed point .",
    "but in the other dimensions this restriction does not take place .    here",
    "we restrict ourselves only by finding nontrivial magnetic fixed point .",
    "in @xcite there was mentioned that it is characterized by zero @xmath199 and @xmath205 .",
    "therefore , the set of five equations of zero @xmath102-functions ( [ bety ] ) is reduced to three equations . applying @xmath227 in ( [ bety ] ) , ( [ gama ] ) and ( [ lambdy ] )",
    "one obtains the set @xmath228 where @xmath229 positive coefficients @xmath230 vanishes at @xmath2 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 are positive for @xmath233 and @xmath234 , respectively .",
    "the set ( [ betared ] ) can be analytically solved with respect to @xmath235 .",
    "because all @xmath180 must be positive , the system ( [ betared ] ) with @xmath227 gives the only solution , @xmath236 where @xmath237 note that the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath5 appears in the solution only as the product @xmath238 in @xmath239 .",
    "the physical value is restricted by the inequality @xmath240 .",
    "denominator in the expression ( [ denominator ] ) for @xmath241 is zero at @xmath242 ( and it is positive for @xmath243 ) , therefore , at @xmath244 we can expect discontinuity and/or divergence .",
    "numerical analysis of the expressions ( [ solut ] ) shows that all @xmath180 have a discontinuity at @xmath244 , and , a physical solution can not exist for any @xmath245 if @xmath246 .",
    "the stability region of the magnetic fixed point and the corresponding critical dimension @xmath214 was determined numerically and it is shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .     on the dimension @xmath0 + for @xmath204 at the magnetic fixed point ( [ solut ] ) for @xmath247 .",
    "all @xmath180 have + discontinuity at @xmath248 ( chained vertical line).,width=340 ]     + figure  [ fig5 ] demonstrates the charges @xmath249 dependence on dimension @xmath0 for several values of parameter @xmath7 .",
    "first , we have found that @xmath250 tend to infinity at limit value @xmath244 . for increasing dimension @xmath0 from @xmath216 up to @xmath244 the charge @xmath251 increase from a small positive value up to infinity at @xmath244 and , therefore , @xmath220 decrease here from a small negative value to minus infinity at @xmath244 ( because @xmath252 and both @xmath232 and @xmath241 are negative in this dimensions ) .",
    "the charge @xmath253 rapidly decrease to zero at @xmath254 for decreasing @xmath0 and continue to minus infinity at @xmath244 .",
    "these limiting value are in correspondence with numerical calculation of the stability region - the system losses stability for the critical dimension @xmath214 lower than approximately @xmath255 for arbitrary parameter @xmath7 .",
    "in this paper we revised the calculations of stability ranges of developed magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the frame of double expansion scheme .",
    "the modified standard minimal subtraction scheme @xcite has been used in the dimension region of @xmath256 up to @xmath257 in both cases of the magnetic field treated as a passive as well as active vector admixture .",
    "we confirm existence of the known `` kinetic '' fixed point ( corresponding to kolmogorov scaling regime ) what is the same in the both considered cases and only difference is in the stability region : the critical dimension @xmath214 is achieved for a slightly higher value of @xmath7-parameter of a magnetic forcing in the case of active magnetic field .",
    "limit value of the inverse prandtl number at @xmath3 restores the value of @xmath258 which is known from usual @xmath5-expansion , and it fluently rises to @xmath1 at @xmath2 , ( figure  1 ) .    it was believed earlier that in the double expansion being defined for the space dimension to be closed to two the results obtained in two dimensions can not be applicable to opposite dimension interval end closed to three . here",
    "we have showed that the double expansion in exact @xmath0-dimensional formulation gives some critical dimension @xmath214 above which the scaling regime is governed by the competition of the stable kinetic and magnetic fixed points which exists in three dimensions .",
    "a new nontrivial results of the present paper is connected with derivation of the exact analytical expression for the nontrivial `` magnetic '' stable fixed point with @xmath259 but nonzero @xmath260 and @xmath251 as well as specification of the borderline dimension @xmath214 .",
    "a physical region of the rg fixed point lies below the @xmath261 line , see in figure  4 .",
    "this point completely losses stability below the critical value of dimension @xmath6 ( independently on the @xmath7-parameter ) and also below the value of @xmath8 ( independently on the dimension ) .",
    "thus we confirm , in particular , that thermal fluctuations of the magnetic scaling regime may occur , and , in comparison with earlier results our value of the borderline dimension ( @xmath6 ) is significantly lower than in the @xmath5 expansion @xcite ( @xmath9 ) and rather lower than in the modified double expansion introduced in @xcite ( @xmath10 ) but it is rather higher then value ( @xmath11 ) calculated in the frame of the mccomb s renormalization @xcite .",
    "note that the stability of any regime determines the concrete alfven ratio @xmath262 ( ratio of kinetic and magnetic energy density in mhd turbulence , see @xcite , for example ) .",
    "once the stationary scaling regime becomes and stands , the alfven ratio is fixed ( i.e. , it means that the fixed point is reached in the field rg terminology ) .",
    "thus the injected energy necessary to steady the stationary scaling regime must have specific value , or , in another words , all `` coupling constants '' @xmath180 are fixed in scaling regime with values which are dependent on dimension @xmath0 . in like manner",
    "the inverse prandtl number @xmath263 ( @xmath264 is magnetic resistivity ) is thus fixed .",
    "verma @xcite has obtained @xmath265 in @xmath215-dimensions for large @xmath266 ( corresponding to region of the kinetic regime ) and for zeroth normalized cross - helicity . for smaller @xmath262",
    "this ratio decrease to @xmath267 for @xmath268 , and , the both @xmath264 and @xmath269 vary approximately as @xmath270 @xcite .",
    "we have mentioned above that in our double expansion calculation in the kinetic point we have fixed the ratio @xmath263 with its @xmath0-dependence showed in figure 1 .",
    "the magnetic fixed point is characterized by decreasing value of @xmath12 to zero what is in correspondence with results of @xcite : his calculation gives for decreasing @xmath262 ( magnetic regime ) in @xmath215-dimensions also decreasing value of @xmath271 as one can expect in the magnetic fixed point .",
