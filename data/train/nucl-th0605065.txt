    "a goal of hadronic physics is to understand the baryon spectrum from qcd , the underlying theory of the strong interaction .",

    ", the time - honored qcd sum rule method  @xcite adds a useful theoretical tool .",
    "it is a non - perturbative approach to qcd that reveals a direct connection between hadronic observables and the qcd vacuum structure via a few universal parameters called vacuum condensates ( vacuum expectation values of qcd local operators ) , the most important of which are the quark condensate , the mixed condensate and the gluon condensate .",
    "the method is analytical , physically transparent , and has minimal model dependence with well - understood limitations inherent in the operator product expansion ( ope ) .",
    "it provides a complementary view of the same non - perturbative physics to the numerical approach of lattice qcd .",
    "the method was applied to the decuplet sector not long after it was introduced  @xcite . however , only limited attention has been paid to this sector since then . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a systematic study was made that incudes some @xmath2 states .",
    "later , progress came in the analysis of qcd sum rules by monte - carlo sampling of errors  @xcite .",
    "it was applied to the study of spin-3/2 branch of baryon decuplet  @xcite , magnetic moments  @xcite and other spin-3/2 excited baryons  @xcite .    from a theoretical standpoint ,",
    "the main issue is how to isolate sum rules that couple to a particular spin - parity , since the interpolating fields used to construct the spin-3/2 states contain both spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 components , and couple to both parities .",
    "separation of the spin-3/2 and spin-1/2 components can be achieved by examining the dirac structures upon which the sum rules are based , as done in ref .",
    "however , the parities are still mixed . in the pole - plus - continuum ansatz of the method , isolation of a particular parity",
    "relies on strong cancellations in the excited part of the spectrum . without such cancellations ,",
    "the sum rules usually suffer contaminations from higher states , a problem that renders them unstable . a solution to separate the parities",
    "exactly was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite which showed improved convergence in the octet baryon sector . in this work ,",
    "we apply the method to the decuplet sector , together with the conventional method .",
    "the goal is to identify sum rules that couple strongly to the four branches of the decuplet with spin - parity @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath1 , and @xmath5 .",
    "in addition to the delta states , we also examine states that contain the strange quark , which have not been studied in detail . in our calculation",
    ", we consistently include operators up to dimension eight , first order strange quark mass corrections , flavor symmetry breaking of the strange quark condensates , anomalous dimension corrections , and possible factorization violation of the four - quark condensate .",
    "furthermore , we try to assess quantitatively the errors in the phenomenological parameters , using the monte - carlo based analysis procedure .",
    "this procedure incorporates all uncertainties in the qcd input parameters simultaneously , and translates them into uncertainties in the phenomenological parameters , with careful regard to ope convergence and ground state dominance .",
    "in the conventional method , the starting point is the time - ordered two - point correlation function in the qcd vacuum @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the interpolating field with the quantum numbers of the baryon under consideration . assuming su(2 ) isospin symmetry in the u and d quarks",

    "that leads to sum rules that contain mixed parity states .",

    "so from the point of view of qcd sum rules , the origin of splittings between positive - parity and negative - parity states lies in the chiral - odd vacuum condensates .",

    "the lhs has errors arising from our imprecise knowledge of the qcd parameters , as discussed above . from statistical point of view",
    ", a @xmath87 minimization of the type @xmath88 offers the least - biased way of finding the unknown parameters . in the monte - carlo based procedure used here ,",
    "first the borel window in @xmath86 is divided equally into a grid ( we use 51 points ) . at each point , the uncertainty distribution in the ope is constructed by randomly - selected , gaussianly - distributed sets generated from the central values and the uncertainties in the qcd input parameters . then the @xmath87 minimization is applied to the sum rule by fitting the phenomenological parameters .",
    "this is done for each qcd parameter set and at each point in @xmath86 , resulting in distributions for phenomenological fit parameters , from which their errors are derived .",
    "usually , 100 such configurations are sufficient for getting stable results .",
    "we generally select 500 sets which help resolve more subtle correlations among the qcd parameters and the phenomenological fit parameters .",
    "so the same sum rule is fitted not just once , but thousands of times in our analysis .",
    "the advantage afforded by the monte - carlo is that the entire phase - space of the input qcd parameters is explored .",
    "the errors obtained this way represent the most realistic and conservative estimates of the predictive power of a qcd sum rule .",
    "this is in contrast to traditional approaches where only a small part of the phase - space is explored at a time .",
    "we select the borel window by trial and error .",
    "our criteria are that the ope is reasonably convergent by looking at the terms of various dimension , and that the fit results should not be sensitive to small changes in the borel window . under these constraints ,",
    "we seek to make the window as wide as possible .",
    "since the selection of borel window @xmath86 and the three phenomenological parameters are inter - dependent in the sum rule , the entire fitting process is iterated until the best solution is found . in general , we seek solutions that are from a three - parameter search in which all three parameters are treated as free simultaneously .",
    "we regard such solutions as the best predictions of the qcd sum rule approach . in the absence of such solutions",
    ", a two - parameter search is performed in which one of the three parameters is fixed .",
    "usually , it is the continuum threshold which is fixed to values that are larger than the mass in question , or to values suggested by the observed spectrum .",
