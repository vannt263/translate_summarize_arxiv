    "this also explains why the dense shell is brighter in the east and west regions . by both quantitative calculation on spherical smoothing and qualitative analysis on dipolar structure ,",
    "we conclude that wind - wind shock dynamic interaction appears natural for the hot bubble formation and diffused x - ray emissions .",
    "different from the pn ngc 40 , the pn ngc 7662 is here inferred to have an inward reverse shock velocity of @xmath298 km s@xmath10 . by expression ( [ xrayluminos ] ) , ngc 7662 is predicted to have an increase of x - ray luminosity with increasing time @xmath45 at an estimated rate of @xmath299erg s@xmath10 per year .",
    "for example , its x - ray luminosity will reach @xmath300 ergs s@xmath10 20 years later and @xmath301 ergs s@xmath10 50 years later .",
    "energy conservation shows a minimum @xmath1 exists so that @xmath122 must be limited by a maximum @xmath270 .",
    "in fact , studies on ngc 40 and ngc 7662 both lead to the conclusion that @xmath302 .",
    "the sensible explanation is that cooling effect becomes very significant even when @xmath122 is still far lower than this upper limit . at the present epoch",
    ", it appears justifiable to not include cooling effects in our piecewise isothermal dynamic model calculations .",
    "akashi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) considered the radiative cooling semi - quantitatively for computing the x - ray luminosity based on the self - similar colliding adiabatic wind model of chevalier & imamura ( 1983 ) and showed that the radiative cooling was unimportant during most time of a pn dynamic evolution .",
    "nevertheless , as radiative cooling becomes important for the hot bubble evolution , e.g. @xmath303yrs later for the case of @xmath304 km s@xmath10 in figure [ fig : ratioevolution ] , it would be inaccurate to compute x - ray emissions either in our model or in that of akashi et al .",
    "the x - ray hot bubble will cool down much faster , the contact discontinuity balance condition would be broken and the outer dense shell dynamic behaviour may be also interrupted .",
    "since x - ray luminosity only takes up @xmath305 of @xmath306 , the energy conservation consideration in section 3 implies that a significant amount of energy should have been converted to other forms during the entire life of pne .",
    "otherwise , the temperature of shocked downstream inner wind should be @xmath11 times higher than the observed temperature inferred from diffuse x - ray emissions .",
    "however , relatively low temperatures of x - ray emitting gas are generally inferred in pne at different evolution stages .",
    "we note that the energy conservation calculation in section 3 is fairly general , where we focus on the mass conservation @xmath307 and choose typical observed parameter values without specifically invoking either the isothermal or adiabatic assumptions .",
    "therefore we suspect that there must be certain long lasting mechanisms to explain the low temperature of x - ray emitting gas , and such mechanisms are not quantitatively taken into account in either @xcite piecewise isothermal model or the adiabatic model of chevalier & imamura ( 1983 ) .",
    "moreover , such mechanisms influence more than radiative cooling does so that shocked hot bubbles do not evolve adiabatically , as implied by the observation of central bright x - ray emission observation in pn bd + 30@xmath43639 .",
    "thermal conduction and material diffusion might be non - negligible if the magnetic field near the expanding contact discontinuity surface becomes sufficiently weak .",
    "another possibility is that the hot bubble largely between the reverse shock and the contact discontinuity becomes turbulent to partially account for the missing energy .",
    "the thermal conduction between hot bubble and cool dense shell could be considerable ( e.g. kastner et al .",
    "2000 ; steffen et al .",
    "the rapid variance of inner fast wind mass loss rate of central stars might also be essential to account for the imbalance between fast wind kinetic energy input and low temperature inferred by diffuse x - ray emissions ( e.g. soker & kastner 2003 ; akashi et al .",
    "2007 ) . in sections 2 and 3",
    ", we did not consider such mechanisms ; instead , we choose the shocked fast wind temperature @xmath94 ( or @xmath0 ) as an adjustable parameter for fitting x - ray observations . in some pne with detected x - ray emissions ,",
    "very distinct bipolar morphology appears , such as henize 3 - 1475 ( e.g. sahai et al .",
    "2003 ) , ngc 7026 ( e.g. gruendl et al . 2006 ) , menzel 3 ( e.g. kastner et a. 2003 ) , and so forth .",
    "collimated outflows and jets in magnetized gas media might be expected to account for these types of diffuse x - ray emissions .",
    "akashi et al .",
    "( 2008 ) performed two - dimensional numerical simulations of jets expanding into the slow wind of agb stars .",
    "they proposed that this jet - wind or outflow - wind interaction model might explain such bipolar morphology of diffuse x - ray emissions .",
