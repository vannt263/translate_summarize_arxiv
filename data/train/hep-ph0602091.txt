    "it was also promptly established that the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 were the same as those of the photon , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , since the following ratio @xmath8 was much larger on - resonance than off , it was then clear that the @xmath0 did have direct hadronic decays . the same conclusion held for the @xmath1 as well .",
    "the study of multiplicity in pion decays indicated that @xmath9 decays were restricted by @xmath10-parity conservation , holding only for hadrons .",
    "consequently , @xmath0 and @xmath1 were rapidly considered as hadrons of isospin 0 and @xmath10-parity -1 .",
    "particles with charge conjugation @xmath11 different from -1 were found later .",
    "indeed , they were only produced by decay of @xmath12 and the detection of the radiated photon during the ( electromagnetic ) decay was then required . the first to achieve this task and discover",
    "a new state was the dasp collaboration@xcite based at desy ( deutsches elektronen - synchrotron ) , hamburg , working at an @xmath13 storage ring called doris . this new particle , named .",

    "3.55 gev were discovered , the 3.5 gev state was confirmed .",
    "later , these states were shown to be @xmath18 .",
    "coming back to the ratio @xmath19 , it is instructive to analyse the implication in the framework of the quark model postulated by gell - mann and zweig in 1963 . in 1974 at the london conference , richter presented@xcite the experimental situation as in  fig .",

    ".,width=188 ]    in the framework of the gell - mann - zweig quark model with three quarks , a plateau was expected with a value of @xmath20 or @xmath21 if the quark were considered as `` coloured ''  a new concept introduced recently then . the sign of a new quark  as the charm quark first proposed by bjorken and glashow in 1964@xcite would have been another plateau from a certain energy ( roughly its mass ) with a height depending on its charge .",
    "retrospectively , one can not blame anyone for not having seen this `` plateau '' on this kind of plots . quoting richter , `` the situation that prevailed in the summer of 1974 '' was `` vast confusion '' .",
    "this charm quark was also required by the mechanism of glashow , iliopoulos and maiani ( gim)@xcite , in order to cancel the anomaly in weak decays .",
    "the charm quark was then expected to exist and to have an electric charge @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath19 was therefore to be @xmath22 in the coloured quark model , still not obvious in  fig .",
    "[ fig : r - richter ] .",
    "this explains why the discovery of such sharp and easily interpreted resonances in november 1974 was a _ revolution _ in particle physics .",
    "it became quite rapidly obvious that the @xmath0 was the lowest - mass @xmath23 system with the same quantum numbers as photons  explaining why it was so much produced compared to some other members of its family .",
    "these @xmath23 bound states were named `` charmonium '' , firstly by appelquist , de rjula , politzer and glashow@xcite in analogy with positronium , whose bound - state level structure was similar .    at that time",
    ", the charm had nevertheless always been found hidden , that is in charm - anti - charm bound states . in order to study these explicitly charmed mesons , named @xmath24 ,",
    "the investigations were based on the assumption that the @xmath24 was to decay weakly and preferentially into strange quarks .",
    "the weak character of the decay motivated physicists to search for parity - violation signals .",
    "the first resonance attributed to @xmath25 meson was found in @xmath26 decay by goldhaber _",
    "et al._@xcite in 1976 .",
    "a little later , @xmath27 and @xmath28 were also discovered as well as an excited state , @xmath29 , with a mass compatible with the decay @xmath30 . and , finally , the most conclusive evidence for the discovery of charmed meson was the observation of parity violation in @xmath24 decays@xcite .",
    "to complete the picture of the charm family , the first charmed baryon was discovered during the same year@xcite .",
    "the quarks were not anymore just a way to interpret symmetry in masses and spins of particles , they had acquired an existence .      in the meantime , in 1975 , another brand new particle was unmasked at slac by perl _ et al._@xcite .",
    "this was the first particle of a third generation of quarks and leptons , the @xmath31 , a lepton .",
    "following the standard model , more and more trusted , two other quarks were expected to exist .",
    "their discovery would then be the very proof of the theory that was developed since the sixties .",
    "two names for the fifth quark were already chosen : `` beauty '' and `` bottom '' , and in both cases represented by the letter @xmath32 ; the sixth quark was as well already christened with the letter @xmath33 for the suggested names `` true '' or `` top '' .",
    "the wait was not long : two years .",
    "after a false discovery for any `` onset of high - mass dilepton physics '' . ] of a resonance at 6.0 gev , a new dimuon resonance similar to @xmath0 and called @xmath2 was brought to light at fermilab , thanks to the fnal proton synchrotron accelerator , by herb _",
    "et al._@xcite , with a mass of 9.0 gev ; as for charmonia , the first radial excited state ( @xmath34 ) was directly found@xcite thereafter .",
    "again , the discovery of a new quarkonium was a decisive step forward towards the comprehension of particle physics .    various confirmations of these discoveries were not long to come .",
    "the @xmath35 state was then found@xcite at fermilab as well as an evidence that the @xmath36 state was lying above the threshold for the production of @xmath37 mesons .",
    "the latter was confirmed at the cornell @xmath13 storage ring with the cleo detector . the first evidence for @xmath37 meson and , thus , for unhidden @xmath32 quark",
    ", was also brought by the cleo collaboration@xcite in 1980 .",
    "one year later , `` the first evidence for baryons with naked beauty''(_sic _ ) was reported by cern physicists@xcite .",
    "another decade was needed for the discovery of the sixth quark which was definitely christened `` top '' .",
    "indeed , in 1994 , the cdf collaboration found the first evidence for it at the tevatron collider at fermilab@xcite .",
    "the discovery was published in 1995 both by cdf@xcite and d@xmath38@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , due to its very short lifetime , this quark can not bind with its antiquark to form the toponium . to conclude this historical prelude",
    ", we give the spectra ( figs .",
    "2 & 3 ) of the @xmath23 and @xmath39 systems as well as two tables ( tables 1 & 2 ) summing up the characteristics of the observed states as of today .    [",
    "table : sum_charmonium ]            [ table : sum_bottomonium ]        this model is the most natural application of qcd to heavy - quarkonium production in the high - energy regime .",
    "it takes its inspiration in the factorisation theorem of qcd@xcite where the hard part is calculated by the strict application pqcd and the soft part is factorised in a universal wave function .",
    "this model is meant to describe the production not only of @xmath0 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath34 and @xmath42 , _",
    "i.e. _  the @xmath43 states , but also the singlet @xmath44 states @xmath45 and @xmath46 as well as the @xmath14 ( @xmath47 ) and @xmath24 states .",
    "its greatest quality resides in its predictive power as the only input , apart from the pdf , namely the wave function , can be determined from data on decay processes or by application of potential models .",
    "nothing more is required .",
    "it was first applied to hadron colliders@xcite , then to electron - proton colliders@xcite .",
    "the cross sections for @xmath43 states were then calculated , as well as also for @xmath48 and @xmath47 , for charmonium and for bottomonium .",
    "these calculations were compared to isr and fnal data from @xmath49 gev to @xmath50 gev for which the data extended to 6 gev for the transverse momentum .",
    "updates@xcite of the model to describe collisions at the cern @xmath51 collider ( @xmath52 gev ) were then presented . at that energy ,",
    "the possibility that the charmonium be produced from the decay of a beauty hadron was becoming competitive .",
    "predictions for tevatron energies were also made@xcite .    in order to introduce the reader to several concepts and quantities that will be useful throughout this review ,",
    "let us proceed with a detailed description of this model .",
    "it was then based on several approximations or postulates :    * if we decompose the quarkonium production in two steps , first the creation of two _ on - shell _ heavy quarks ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 ) and then their binding to make the meson , one _ postulates the factorisation _ of these two processes .",
    "* as the scale of the first process is approximately @xmath55 , one considers it as a _ perturbative _ one .",
    "one supposes that its cross section be computable with feynman - diagram methods . *",
    "as we consider only bound states of heavy quarks ( charm and bottom quarks ) , their velocity in the meson must be small .",
    "one therefore supposes that the meson be created with its 2 constituent quarks _ at rest _ in the meson frame .",
    "this is _ the static approximation . _",
    "* one finally assumes that the colour and the spin of the @xmath56 pair do not change during the binding .",
    "besides , as physical states are colourless , one requires the pair be produced in a _ colour - singlet state_. this explains the name colour - singlet model ( csm ) .    in high - energy hadronic collisions ,",
    "the leading contribution comes from a gluon fusion process ; as the energy of the collider increases , the initial parton momentum fraction @xmath57 needed to produce the quarkonium decreases to reach the region in @xmath58 where the number of gluons becomes much larger than the number of quarks .",
    "one has then only six feynman diagrams for the @xmath43 states production associated with a gluon ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : csm_box ] ) .     at lo within the csm.,width=302 ]    one usually starts with @xmath59 , the perturbative amplitude to produce the heavy - quark pair on - shell with relative momentum @xmath60 and in a configuration similar to the one of the meson . to realise the latter constraint ,",
    "one introduces a projection operator matrix to pseudoscalars , @xmath61 to vectors , etc . ] ; the amplitude @xmath59 is then simply calculated with the usual feynman rules .",
    "the amplitude to produce the meson is thence given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the usual schrdinger wave - function .",
    "fortunately , one does not have to carry out the integration thanks to the _ the static approximation _ which amounts to considering the first non - vanishing term of @xmath64 when the perturbative part @xmath65 is expanded in @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath44-wave , this gives    @xmath66    where @xmath67 is the wave - function in coordinate space , and @xmath68 or @xmath69 is its value at the origin . for @xmath14-waves ,",
    "@xmath69 is zero , and the second term in the taylor expansion must be considered ; this makes appear @xmath70 .",
    "@xmath69 ( or @xmath70 ) is the non - perturbative input , which is also present in the leptonic decay width from which it can be extracted .",
    "if the perturbative part @xmath59 is calculated at the leading order in @xmath71 , this will be referred to as the leading order csm ( lo csm)@xcite .",
    "this model was initially introduced in 1977@xcite and was revived in 1996 by halzen  _ et al._@xcite.contrarily to the csm , the heavy - quark pair produced by the perturbative interaction is not assumed to be in a colour - singlet state .",
    "one simply considers that the colour and the spin of the asymptotic @xmath56 state is randomised by numerous soft interactions occurring after its production , and that , as a consequence , it is not correlated with the quantum numbers of the pair right after its production .",
    "a first outcome of this statement is that the production of a @xmath43 state by one gluon is possible , whereas in the csm it was forbidden solely by colour conservation .",
    "in addition , the probability that the @xmath56 pair eventually be in a colour - singlet state is therefore @xmath72 , which gives the total cross section to produce a quarkonium : @xmath73 this amounts to integrating the cross section of production of @xmath56 from the threshold @xmath74 up to the threshold to produce two charm or beauty mesons ( designated here by @xmath75 ) and one divides by 9 to get the probability of having a colour - singlet state .    the procedure to get the cross section for a definite state , for instance a @xmath0 , is tantamount to `` distributing '' the cross sections among all states : @xmath76 the natural value for @xmath77 , as well as for the other states in that approximation , is the inverse of the number of quarkonium lying between @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "this can be refined by factors arising from spin multiplicity arguments or by the consideration of the mass difference between the produced and the final states .",
    "these are included in the soft - colour - interactions approach ( sci ) ( see section  [ subsec : sci ] ) .    by construction , this model is unable to give information about the polarisation of the quarkonium produced , which is a key test for the other models@xcite .",
    "furthermore , nothing but fits can determine the values to input for @xmath80 .",
    "considering production ratios for charmonium states within the simplest approach for spin , we should have for instance @xmath81:\\sigma[j/\\psi ] =   1:3 $ ] and @xmath82:\\sigma[\\chi_{c1}]:\\sigma[\\chi_{c2 } ] =   1:3:5 $ ] , whereas deviations from the predicted ratio for @xmath83 and @xmath84 have been observed .",
    "moreover , it is unable to describe the observed variation  from one process to another  of the production ratios for charmonium states .",
    "for example , the ratio of the cross sections for @xmath85 and @xmath0 differs significantly in photoproduction and hadroproduction , whereas for the cem these number are strictly constant .",
    "all these arguments make us think that despite its simplicity and its phenomenological reasonable grounds , this model is less reliable than the csm .",
    "it is also instructive to point out that the invocation of reinteractions after the @xmath56 pair production contradicts factorisation , which is albeit required when the pdf are used . however , as we shall see now , the csm has undergone in the nineties a lashing denial from the data .      in 1984 ,",
    "et al._@xcite noticed that charmonium production from a weak @xmath37 decay could be significant at high energy ",
    "their prediction were made for @xmath86 gev  and could even dominate at high enough @xmath3 .",
    "this can be easily understood having in mind that the @xmath37 meson is produced by fragmentation of a @xmath32 quark  the latter dresses with a light quark . and to produce only one @xmath32 quark at high @xmath3 is not so burdensome ; the price to pay is only to put one quark propagator off - shell , instead of two for @xmath87 .",
    "this idea was confirmed by the calculations of glover _",
    "et al._@xcite , which were used as a benchmark by the ua1 collaboration@xcite . after the introduction of a @xmath88 factor of 2 ,",
    "the measurements agreed with the predictions ; however the @xmath3 slope was not compatible with @xmath32-quark fragmentation simulations .    from 1992 ,",
    "the cdf collaboration undertook an analysis of @xmath9 stands for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "] production .",
    "they managed to extract unambiguously the _ prompt _ component of the signal ( not from @xmath37 decay ) using a silicon vertex detector ( svx)@xcite .",
    "the preliminary results@xcite showed an unexpectedly large _ prompt _ component .",
    "for the @xmath1 , the _ prompt _ cross section was orders of magnitude above the predictions of the lo csm ( compare the data to the dashed curve on fig .",
    "[ fig : dsdpt_braaten-94 ] ( right ) ) .",
    "this problem was then referred to as the @xmath1 anomaly . for @xmath0 ,",
    "the discrepancy was smaller ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dsdpt_braaten-94 ] ( left ) ) , but it was conceivably blurred by the fact that a significant part of the production was believed to come from @xmath85 radiative feed - down , but no experimental results were there to confirm this hypothesis .      the prediction from the lo csm for _ prompt _ @xmath9 being significantly below these preliminary measurements by cdf , braaten and yuan@xcite pointed out in 1993 that gluon fragmentation processes , even though of higher order in @xmath71 , were to prevail over the lo csm for @xmath44-wave mesons at large @xmath3 , in same spirit as the production from @xmath37 was dominant as it came from a fragmentation process . following this paper , with cheung and fleming@xcite , they considered the fragmentation of @xmath89 quark into a @xmath9 in @xmath90 decay . from this calculation , they extracted the corresponding fragmentation function . in another paper@xcite",
    ", they considered gluon fragmentation into @xmath14-wave mesons .",
    "all the tools were then at hand for a full prediction of the prompt component of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the tevatron .",
    "this was realised simultaneously by cacciari and greco @xcite and by braaten _",
    "et al._@xcite .",
    "let us now review briefly the approach followed .    to all orders in @xmath71",
    ", we have the following fragmentation cross section for a quarkonium @xmath91 : @xmath92 the fragmentation scale , @xmath93 , is as usual chosen to avoid large logarithms of @xmath94 in @xmath95 , that is @xmath96 .",
    "the summation of the corresponding large logarithms of @xmath97 appearing in the fragmentation function is realised via an evolution equation@xcite .",
    ".,width=321 ]    the interesting point raised by braaten and yuan is that the fragmentation functions can be calculated perturbatively in @xmath71 at the scale @xmath98 .",
    "for instance , in the case of gluon fragmentation into an @xmath45 , the trick is to note that @xmath99 is the ratio to the rates for the well - known @xmath100 process and @xmath101 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : etac_fragm_ratio_csm ] ) .",
    "after some manipulations , the fragmentation function can be obtained from this ratio by identifying the integrand in the @xmath102 integral .",
    "this gives : @xmath103 .",
    "\\end{split}\\ ] ]    the other fragmentation functions of a given parton @xmath104 into a given quarkonium @xmath91 , @xmath105 , were obtained in the same spirit . for the tevatron ,",
    "the differential cross section versus @xmath3 of various csm fragmentation processes are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dsdpt_divers ] ( left ) .",
    "the _ prompt _ component of the @xmath0 and the direct component of the @xmath1 could in turn be obtained and compared with the preliminary data of cdf ( see the solid curves in plots in fig .  [",
    "fig : dsdpt_braaten-94 ] above ) . for the @xmath0 ,",
    "the previous disagreement was reduced and could be accounted for by the theoretical and experimental uncertainties ; on the other hand , for the @xmath1 , the disagreement continued to be dramatic .",
    "the situation would be clarified by the extraction of the direct component for @xmath0 , for which theoretical uncertainties are reduced and are similar to those for the @xmath1 .",
    "the cdf collaboration undertook the disentanglement of the direct @xmath0 signal@xcite .",
    "they searched for @xmath0 associated with the photon emitted during this radiative decay : the result was a direct cross section 30 times above expectations from lo csm plus fragmentation .",
    "this was the confirmation that the csm was not the suitable model for heavy - quarkonium production in high - energy hadron collisions .",
    "it is a common misconception of the csm to believe that the well - known factor 30 of discrepancy between data and theory for direct production of @xmath0 arises when the data are compared with the predictions for the lo csm following baier , rckl , chang ,  , @xcite tuned to the right energy . as you can see on fig .",
    "[ fig : dsdpt_divers ] ( right ) , the factor would be rather of two orders of magnitude at large @xmath3 for @xmath0 .",
    "the same conclusion holds also for @xmath1 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : dsdpt_braaten-94 ] ( right ) ) .",
    "it is also worth pointing that , in the csm , the direct component of @xmath9 ( @xmath43 charmonia ) produced by fragmentation is mainly from @xmath89-quark fragmentation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dsdpt_divers ] ( left ) ) as soon as @xmath106 reaches 5 gev and the @xmath71 penalty of the gluon fragmentation is not compensated anymore by the @xmath89-quark mass .",
    "it was further pointed out in 2003 by qiao  @xcite that sea - quark initiated contributions could dominate in the fragmentation region ( large @xmath3 ) .",
    "limiting ourselves to high - energy collisions , the most recent published results for quarkonium hadroproduction come from two accelerators :    1 .   the tevatron at fermilab which  as stated by its name  runs at tev energy with proton - antiproton collisions . for run",

    "it is worth pointing out here that high - energy @xmath60-@xmath107 and @xmath60-@xmath60 collisions give similar results for the same kinematics , due to the small contribution of valence quarks .",

    "this approximation is usually justified by the fact that the wave function , parameterising the amplitude of probability for the binding , should be peaked at the origin and expanding its product with the hard amplitude , one has only to keep the first non - vanishing term in the taylor series . in the latter , the hard part is evaluated at this static and on - shell configuration .",

    "we have first started with the soft - colour interaction approach which deals with monte carlo simulation .",

    "we have presented the initial motivations of the approach , namely to cure ir divergences of the colour - singlet model .",
    "since it introduces unknown non - perturbative parameters called long - distance matrix elements ( ldme ) , we have reproduced the values obtained by different groups , as well as the values obtained for the colour - singlet matrix elements . as said before , this approach is in contradiction with data to what concerns the polarisation .",
    "some modifications of the scaling rules , which normally provide a hierarchy between the lmde s , were proposed to reduce the discrepancy but the confirmation of the new cdf preliminary measurement would certainly blacken the setting . finally , according to a recent analysis centered on fixed - target experiments by f.  maltoni _",

    "fourthly , we have briefly reviewed a calculation proposed by physicists from durham of some specific nnlo pqcd contributions of the csm .",
    "these can be viewed as lo bfkl contributions and thus are expected to be enhanced compared to other nnlo pqcd ones .",
    "unfortunately , the method used can not predict the @xmath106 slope of the cross section .",
    "the fifth model reviewed deals with reinteractions with comovers .",
    "two pictures were analysed : one for small @xmath106 events where the comovers are created by bremtrahlung of the colliding gluons and another for high-@xmath106 events where they are produced by dglap radiation of the fragmenting parton .",
    "the authors of the model suspect such re - scatterings to be source of a possible enhancement of the cross section , and if the picture holds , they predict that in the case of gluon fragmentation , the quarkonia are produced unpolarised .",
    "the last approach reviewed is a consistent scheme to go beyond the static and on - shell approximation used , for instance , in the csm and the cem .",
    "the loss of gauge invariance caused by the introduction of such non - local effects was shown to be curable by the introduction of 4-point vertices . in the case of @xmath1 , the presence of a node in the vertex function , which is typical of radially excited states and whose effects",
    "are necessarily neglected in the static approximation , was shown to have non - negligible effects and is therefore expected to be analysed in other processes .",
    "finally , on a more formal basis , for all models , we are lacking a factorisation theorem suitable both for charmonium and bottomonium cases . to what concerns nrqcd , even though some modification of it are required@xcite , it has been shown recently that the ( modified ) picture still holds at nnlo@xcite at least for fragmentation processes which are supposed to dominate in the large @xmath106 regime .    in view of similar discrepancies between theory and data at @xmath37-factories",

    "<S> the first is the natural application of pqcd to quarkonium production and has been shown to fail dramatically to describe experimental data , the second is its phenomenological counterpart and was introduced in the spirit of the quark - hadron duality in the late seventies . </S>",
    "<S> then , we expose the most recent experimental measurements of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 prompt and direct production at nonzero @xmath3 from two high - energy hadron colliders , the tevatron and rhic . in a third part </S>",
