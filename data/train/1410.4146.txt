    "the stokes shift response function ( or time - dependent solvation correlation function ) describes the solvent response to a sudden change in the charge distribution of a solute molecule , and has been measured over different time scales and for a variety of polar solvents ( cf . refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "we briefly rederive the relationship between the fluorescence stokes shift and the spectral density in order to expose the underlying assumptions .",
    "the essential argument follows that in ref . .        in typical stokes",
    "shift experiments , a chromophore solute in a polar solvent is first excited by a pump pulse , and the time - dependent fluorescence spectrum of the solute is then recorded@xcite ( see fig .",

    "is defined as@xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the non - equilibrium energy difference between the excited state and the ground state and is proportional to the time dependence of a characteristic fluorescence frequency .",
    "the goal is then to relate the non - equilibrium relaxation encoded in @xmath1 with equilibrium fluctuations of the energy difference and then extract the spectral density . in doing so ,",
    "let us a consider a two - electronic state system , with electronic transition frequency @xmath4 , coupled to a thermal bath @xmath5 via the interaction term @xmath6 , and to a radiation field @xmath7 via the dipole moment @xmath8 , so that the hamiltonian is described by @xmath9 here @xmath10 s are the pauli matrices and @xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the bath and system coordinates , respectively .    following ref .",
    ", we use the heisenberg picture and split the interaction term @xmath6 into an average and a fluctuating part , @xmath13 .",
    "as is customary , in order to have an effective description of the coupling to the bath , one assumes that @xmath14 behaves as a random variable and that it is characterized by its symmetrized , @xmath15 , and anti - symmetrized correlation functions@xcite , @xmath16\\rangle$ ] . for convenience below we note that in accord with kubo s formula , the linear response of the system to the fluctuating perturbation @xmath14 is defined as the mean value of the commutator @xmath14 , i.e. , in terms of the anti - symmetrized correlation function @xmath17 .",

    "the description is also very accurate , with no need for an additional baseline contribution .",
    "we have discussed an experimentally accessible way to directly determine the spectral densities of molecular complexes , which is also applicable to systems in solid state physics such as quantum dots .",

    "most importantly , the quantum noise has an associated non - zero susceptibility and therefore one expects a finite width to the zero phonon line ( zpl ) .",

    "<S> determining the spectral density of a molecular system immersed in a proteomic scaffold and in contact to a solvent is a fundamental challenge in the coarse - grained description of , e.g. , electron and energy transfer dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> once the spectral density is characterized , all the time scales are captured and no artificial separation between fast and slow processes need be invoked . based on the fluorescence stokes shift function , we utilize a simple and robust strategy to extract the spectral density of a number of molecular complexes from available experimental data . specifically , we show that experimental data for dye molecules in several solvents , amino acid proteins in water , and some photochemical systems ( e.g. , rhodopsin and green fluorescence proteins ) , are well described by a three - parameter family of sub - ohmic spectral densities that are characterized by a fast initial gaussian - like decay followed by a slow algebraic - like decay rate at long times . </S>"
