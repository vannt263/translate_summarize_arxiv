    "ngc246 , also known as the ` skull nebula ' is a planetary nebula in the constellation cetus , which was first observed by w.  herschel in 1785 .",
    "the nebula exhibits a slightly elliptical morphology with a diameter of about 224arcsec in average @xcite , a temperature of about 20000k , and shows nev and ovi emission lines in its far - ultraviolet spectrum , as measured with the _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _",
    "( _ fuse _ ) , indicating photoionization from the intense uv - radiation of its central star @xcite .",
    "the nebula is classified as an old wzo3 stage interacting planetary nebula with an dynamical age of about 6600yr ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , which expands with a velocity of about 39.5km / s , as derived by @xcite .",
    "the central star of the planetary nebula is hip3678a ( alias wd0044 - 121 ) , whose proper and parallactic motion was measured by the astrometry satellite _ hipparcos _ ( @xmath3mas / yr and",
    "@xmath4mas / yr , @xmath5mas , as newly determined by * ? ? ?",
    "hip3678a is a very hot ovi sequence @xcite , or pg1159 - 35(lge ) @xcite star with an effective temperature of about 150000k , a mass of 0.84@xmath6 , and a surface gravity of log(g ) @xmath7(cgs ) @xcite .",
    "whereas the nebula was not detected in x - ray , its central star has _",
    "rosat _ and _ chandra _ detections and shows a non - local thermodynamical equilibrium model consistent pg1159-type spectrum @xcite .",
    "hip3678a has a known common proper motion companion , which is located about 3.8arcsec northeast of its primary star , first noted by @xcite and later then confirmed by @xcite . by fitting photometric measurements of the comoving companion to the zero age main sequence , @xcite derived a distance of @xmath8pc for the hip3678 system , while @xcite derived a distance of @xmath9pc , using the parallax expansion method , based on imaging data of the planetary nebula , obtained by @xcite .",
    "additional distances of the planetary nebula were obtained ( @xmath10pc , and @xmath11pc , by * ? ? ? * and mcdonald et al .",
    "2012 , respectively ) , which well agree with the previous distance estimates . in our research",
    "we adopt here a distance of @xmath12pc , which is the mean and the @xmath13-error of the distance values given in the literature , as listed above .",
    "the planetary nebula ngc246 with its central stellar system is shown in the right - hand panel of fig.[fig : imags ] .",
    "this pattern is a colour - composite image , composed of images from the digitized all sky survey ( dss ) , which were taken through different optical filters at observing epochs between 1954 and 1994 . assuming a distance of 504pc , ngc246 exhibits an averaged projected diameter of about 110000au .",
    "the elliptical shape of the planetary nebula is clearly visible in the dss image with its semimajor axis aligned in the east to west direction , consistent with the motion of its central stellar system .",
    "the ( leading ) western shell of ngc246 appears clearly brighter than the eastern ( trailing ) shell of the nebula , possibly induced by compressional heating due to the motion of the planetary nebula through space and its interaction with the interstellar medium .    in this paper , we present astro- and photometric measurements of the stellar system hip3678 in the centre of ngc246 , which were obtained and analysed in the course of our high - contrast imaging survey , to study the multiplicity of b stars in the near - infrared , using imaging data taken with the adaptive optics imager naco ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and rousset et al . 2003 ) at the very large telescope ( vlt ) , operated by the european southern observatory ( eso ) in chile .",
    "the order of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : observations ] , we describe all details of the individual observations and the applied data - reduction procedures , and present the astrometric calibration of the used instruments . in the section  [ sec : astrometry ] , we show all astrometric measurements , as well as the proper motion analysis of the detected companions in the hip3678 system . in section  [ sec : phot ] , we present the results of our photometric analysis , as well as the mass and age estimation of the detected companions . finally , in the last section we summarize and discuss all results reported in this work .",
    "the near - infrared data of hip3678 , which are presented here , were taken with naco in two observing epochs in 2004 and 2007 . in 2004 , hip3678 was imaged with naco s s13 optics in the _ j _ , _ h _ , and _ ks _ band , while in 2007 observations were taken only in the _ ks _ band using naco s s27 optics . in both observing epochs , the jitter technique was applied to effectively cancel out the bright background of the sky in the near - infrared .",
    "several short integrations ( dit ) were taken per jitter position and several of these integrations ( ndit ) were then averaged to one image .",
    "the target was then observed at several ( nint ) different randomly chosen jitter positions located within a jitter - width of 6arcsec with the s13 , and 5arcsec with the s27 optics .",
    "in addition to the high - contrast near - infrared naco observations , hip3678 was also observed with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) in 1994 in one observing epoch using the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) . the fully reduced and calibrated image with a total detector integration time of 2000s , taken in the _ f656n _",
    "filter , was extracted from the _ hst _ data - archive .",
    "figure[fig : imags ] shows the naco and _ hst _ images of hip3678 in the centre of ngc246 .    for the data reduction of the naco images , we use appropriate calibration data from the eso data - archive , i.e. darks with the same exposure time , and flats taken in the same filter and in the same night as the science data . in order to reduce all imaging data , we use esorex , which is part of eso s common pipeline library ( cpl )",
    ". for each science frame a master - dark subtraction and flat - field correction",
    "is applied , and all images are averaged with esorex , using the provided shift+add procedure including measurement and subtraction of the bright background of the sky in the near - infrared .",
    "all naco images were astrometrically calibrated [ determination of the pixel - scale ( ps ) and the position angle ( dpa ) of the naco detector ] using our astrometrical self - calibration technique , as described in detail by @xcite .",
    "thereby , the individual naco science frames are used and shifts induced by the jitter technique are measured in the images , using all detected sources in the images . by comparing these shifts with the offsets of the telescope pointing , as given in the fits - headers of the individual science frames , the pixel - scale and position angle of the detector can be determined even in the case that no astrometric standards are available for an observing epoch ( which is the case here ) .",
    "in contrast to the naco observations , hip3678 was observed with the _ hst _ only at one telescope pointing , hence no astrometrical calibration of the wfpc2 detector for the given observing epoch is available .",
    "therefore , we use here the pixel - scale and detector alignment , as given in world coordinate system ( wcs ) in the fits - header of the _ hst _ image , extracted from the _ hst _ data - archive . since no uncertainties for the astrometrical calibration are given , the resulting astrometric precision has to be considered as a lower limit .",
    "the used instruments , filters , integration - times , number of taken images , as well as the derived astrometric calibration for all observing epochs , whose data are presented in this work , is summarized in the observation log in tab.[tab : obs ] .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     with a mass of 0.84m@xmath2 for the white dwarf hip3678a , as derived by @xcite , we expect a mass of its progenitor star of about 4.3@xmath14 , using the initial to final mass relationship of white dwarf from @xcite .",
    "this yields a main - sequence lifetime of the progenitor star of about 260myr ( assuming a mass  luminosity relation of @xmath15 ) . due to the short cooling age of the white dwarf of only about 6600yr , as derived by @xcite , the derived age of the progenitor star also corresponds to the total age of the hip3678 system , assuming that the hip3678a , b & c are coeval . in the colour  magnitude diagram in fig.[img : cmd ] , we show the colours and absolute magnitudes of all components of the hip3678 system together with the @xmath16})=8.4 $ ] isochrone of the evolutionary models of low - mass star from @xcite .",
    "while hip3678a appears significantly bluer than a main - sequence star of the same absolute magnitude , as it is expected for a young and hot white dwarf , the photometry of the two comoving companions hip3678b and c agrees well with the expected colours and magnitudes of low - mass stars with an age of 260myr , which are located at the distance of the hip3678 system .",
    "hence , the companionship of both comoving companions to hip3678a is well supported by photometry .    by assuming a system age of 260myr",
    ", we can derive the masses of hip3678b and c using the determined absolute magnitudes of the comoving companions and the @xcite evolutionary models , which yield a mass of @xmath17m@xmath2 for hip3678b and @xmath18m@xmath2 for hip3678c , respectively .",
    "furthermore , the spectral types of the detected companions can be approximated using the magnitude  spectral - type relation from @xcite . according to this relation",
    ", we expect that hip3678b is an early to mid - k dwarf ( k2k5 ) , while hip3678c is a mid - m dwarf with a spectral type in the range between m5 and m6 .",
    "among all imaging data presented in this work , the naco _ ks _ band observations from 2004 exhibit the highest contrast . the achieved ( @xmath19 ) detection limit versus angular and projected separation is illustrated in fig.[img : detlim ] .    beside hip3678b & c , no additional companion - candidates could be detected in this observing epoch within the fully covered field of view , i.e. at angular separations smaller than 6arcsec ( @xmath203000au of projected separation ) around hip3678a . in the background noise",
    "limited region a ( @xmath19 ) detection limit , confirmed by inserting and retrieving simulated companions at this contrast level , see @xcite . ] of about 20mag",
    "is reached at angular separations from hip3678a beyond about 0.5arcsec . at the derived age of the hip3678 system of about 260myr ,",
    "this allows the detection of low - mass sub - stellar companions with masses down to 36@xmath21 and projected separations from hip3678a of more than about 250au .",
    "all stellar companions ( mass@xmath22m@xmath23 ) of hip3678a can be detected at angular separations larger than 0.26arcsec ( @xmath20130au of projected separation ) .",
    "the naco observations from 2007 were taken with the s27 optics and fully cover a field of view around hip3678a with an angular radius of 11arcsec ( @xmath205500au of projected separation ) . also in this larger field of view , no additional companions of hip3678a are detected .",
    "due to worse weather conditions , these imaging data are about 0.5mag less sensitive than the ones taken in 2004 , but the achieved contrast is sufficiently high so that additional stellar companions can be ruled out at angular separations beyond 0.45arcsec ( @xmath20220au ) and companions with masses down to 43m@xmath23 are detectable in the background - limited region at angular separations wider than 1arcsec ( @xmath20500au ) . combined with the high - contrast imaging data , obtained with naco in 2004",
    ", we therefore can conclude that there are no additional stellar companions of hip3678a with projected separations between 130 and up to 5500au .",
    "in the course of our multiplicity study of b stars , we have analysed near - infrared and visual imaging data taken with naco / vlt and wfpc2/_hst _ of hip3678a the central star of the planetary nebula ngc246 .",
    "the individual data were taken from the eso and _ hst _ data - archives , and were combined with data points from the literature and from the 2mass - psc . in the high - contrast naco , as well as in the hst data of lower resolution , we detected a new companion of hip3678a , which clearly shares a common proper motion with its primary star .",
    "the new companion hip3678c is located north - east of hip3678a at an angular separation of about 1arcsec ( @xmath20500au of projected separation ) . with its previously known comoving companion ,",
    "this detection makes the central star of the planetary nebula an hierarchical triple system , composed of the close binary system hip3678ac and its wider companion hip3678b at a projected separation of about 1900au ( @xmath203.9arcsec ) .",
    "as described in the literature hip3678a exhibits a mass of about 0.84m@xmath2 , as derived from its effective temperature and luminosity using evolutionary models of young white dwarfs . with the initial to final mass relation of white dwarfs from @xcite ,",
    "this yields an initial mass of the progenitor star of hip3678a of about 4.3@xmath14 .",
    "due to the short dynamical age of the planetary nebula ngc246 of about only 6600yr , as described in the literature , the age of the hip3678 system can be approximated to correspond to the main - sequence lifetime of the white dwarf progenitor star of about 260myr .",
    "the obtained apparent photometry of the comoving companions hip3678b & c agrees well with low - mass stellar companions with the same age , as derived for hip3678a , being located at the distance of the white dwarf .",
    "according to the @xcite , evolutionary models hip3678b and c exhibit masses of about 0.85 and 0.1m@xmath2 , respectively . using the absolute magnitude  spectral - type relation from @xcite",
    ", we expect that hip3678b is an early to mid - k dwarf , while hip3678c is a m5 to m6 dwarf .    with the naco high - contrast imaging observations , additional stellar companions of the white dwarf",
    "can be ruled out around hip3678a at projected separations in the range between 130 and up to 5500au .",
    "the same holds for brown dwarf companions with masses down to about 36m@xmath24 at projected separations beyond about 500 up to 3000au , and down to 36m@xmath24 in the range of separation between 3000 and up to 5000au .",
    "the hip3678 is an evolved stellar system , which underwent a significant mass - loss of its primary component . assuming conservation of angular momentum e.g. due to radial symmetric mass - loss during the post main - sequence lifetime of the white dwarf progenitor star and the formation phase of the planetary nebula",
    ", we can approximate the initial separations of the components to hip3678a . the total mass of the system decrease from about 5.2 to 1.8m@xmath2 , which yields an expansion factor of the hip3678 system of about three .",
    "hence , the system was significantly smaller in its initial configuration , but clearly wider than about 100au .",
    "due to the wide initial separation of the hip3678ac binary , a common envelope phase of the evolved white dwarf progenitor star and its m dwarf companion during the asymptotic giant branch phase of the star can most probably be ruled out .    so far , about 40 close binaries could be detected as central stars of planetary nebulae all , which exhibit orbital periods of up to only a few days , mostly detected by periodic photometric variability or excess emission in the near - infrared ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* de marco 2014 , and references therein ) . wider binaries with periods of more than 1000d",
    "could be detected in the centre of planetary nebulae via radial velocity measurements ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to these close stellar systems , only a few planetary nebulae are known , which harbour binary systems in their centres with wider separations of a few hundreds up to many thousands au , i.e. with orbital periods of more than 1000yr . the main survey for such wide systems",
    "was carried out with the _ hst _ @xcite .",
    "more recently further wide binaries in the centre of planetary nebulae could be identified , e.g. by @xcite , or most recently by @xcite . among these nebulae , there are also two with possible triples in their centre , namely abell63 and ngc7008 .",
    "however , the triple nature of the central stars of these nebulae needs confirmation via follow - up high - contrast imaging observations and astrometry .",
    "hence , the detection of hip3678c , reported here , makes ngc246 the first known planetary nebula with a confirmed hierarchical triple stellar system in its centre .",
