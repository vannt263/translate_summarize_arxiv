    "at present particle physics finds itself at a very interesting juncture .",
    "almost all the experimental observations are explained , to a great precision of @xmath6 part per mill or more , in terms of the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the triumph of the gauge paradigm , in describing correctly the fundamental particles and interactions among them , is almost complete with the 2004 nobel prize being awarded for the discovery of asymptotic freedom .",
    "the higgs boson still eludes direct experimental observation , but the current precision data and direct searches bound its mass ( in the sm ) in a range which is accessible perhaps to the tevatron and definitely to the lhc . in spite of this tremendous success , the sm still does not give us a fundamental understanding of quite a few of its features .",
    "cp violation ( cpv ) in the sm happens to be one of them .",
    "the precision measurements by babar and belle at the @xmath7factories  @xcite show conclusively that _ all _ the cp violation observed experimentally so far , can be accurately described in terms of that in the up - quark mass matrix encoded in the phase in the cabbibo - kobayashi - masakawa(ckm ) quark - mixing matrix .",
    "however , this amount of cpv is not sufficient to provide a _ quantitative _ understanding of the observed baryon asymmetry(ba ) i.e. , @xmath8 _ but _ @xmath9 .",
    "this makes a source of cpv , beyond that in the sm , imperative .",
    "hence it seems logical to investigate implications of such additional cpv for the various theoretical attempts that the particle physics community is investigating to go beyond the sm in order to cure its various deficiencies .",
    "supersymmetry(susy ) , by now almost the standard beyond the standard model ( bsm ) physics , is arguably the best option to stabilise the higgs mass ( and hence the ew scale ) against radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "susy phenomenology at the lhc occupies a place of pride in the lhc studies , next only to the higgs physics .",
    "a discussion of cpv on susy phenomenology at the lhc therefore , forms a very important part of the studies . in the following i will first discuss general issues about cpv and the mssm .",
    "then i will discuss the effects of cpv in susy on mssm phenomenology at the colliders and summarise the effects of the cpv in mssm on the higgs searches at the lep and lhc .",
    "further , i will discuss how a study of the process @xmath1 may be able to plug a hole \" in the @xmath2-@xmath3 plane , where the lep has no sensitivity and where the searches in the usual discovery channels at the lhc are likely to fail as well",
    "cpv in susy has almost changed from an ugly duckling to a swan in the recent years . the most general supersymmetric version of the sm , a mssm with complex susy parameters , contains 44 phases which can not be rotated away by a simple redefinition of the fields . in early days of susy , these phases were all tuned to zero so as to avoid unacceptably large electric dipole moments ( edm s ) for fermions . however , a few years back it was noted  @xcite that it was possible to satisfy all the constraints on the edm s with some of the phases of @xmath10 , quite generally , provided the first two generations of squarks are heavy .    at this point",
    "it is also worth noting that the cpv in the higgs sector is a very attractive source for the above mentioned additional cpv that is required for a quantitative explanation of the observed ba in the universe .",
    "the  phases of the susy(breaking ) parameters can induce , through loop effects ,  in a higgs sector which is cp - conserving at the tree level . thus in the mssm",
    "it maybe possible to satisfy all the edm constraints and still have sufficient in the theory to explain the ba quantitatively .",
    "thus it is clear that  susy will also have implications for the higgs phenomenology at the colliders .",
    "given the fact that higgs searches is raison detre for the current and future colliders , investigations of  in supersymmetric theories are phenomenologically very interesting indeed .",
    "the independent phases in the mssm that can be large ( up to @xmath11 ) , even after imposing the edm constraints , are the phase of the higssino mass term @xmath12 , the trilinear coupling @xmath13 as well as the gaugino masses @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to this , the sfermion mass matrix also can have nonzero phases for each generation .",
    "these phases affect the masses of the sparticles and the higgs bosons as well as their couplings to the sm particles and to each other .",
    "thus their presence can affect the phenomenology of the sfermions , charginos / neutralinos and that of the higgs bosons at the colliders .",
    "these phases can thus change even the cp - even variables such as the sparticle production rates , their decay widths and branching ratios .",
    "of course the direct measure of these phases will be the non - zero value of cp - odd observables constructed out of the momenta of the final state decay products .",
    "effects of nonzero  phases on the search and study of @xmath15 , sfermions and the charged higgses have been investigated in great detail  @xcite . due to the high precision of the measurements that would be possible at the ilc  @xcite , at times the cp - even variables like the branching ratios , cross - sections , polarisations of fermions in final state , will offer a better probe of the phases than the cp - odd quantities constructed out of the final state momenta .    for the hadronic colliders the effects of cpv in mssm on higgs phenomenology",
    "have been studied in the context of tevatron and the lhc  @xcite , whereas that on the @xmath15 phenomenology has been studied mainly only in the context of the tevatron  @xcite .",
    "i will begin with a brief discussion of the latter in the next subsection .",
    "the end point of the invariant mass distribution of the dilepton pair produced in the three body decay @xmath17 , plays a very important role in susy phenomenology , particularly at the hadron colliders .",
    "nonzero cpv phases can change this distribution substantially and thus can affect phenomenology of cascade decays of the sparticles .",
    "further , this also opens up possibility of extracting information on the cpv phase if _ all _ the susy model parameters are known . at a @xmath18 collider , it is possible to construct cp - odd quantities , for @xmath19 system , producing a trilepton signal via @xmath20 .",
    "since the initial state is a cp - eigenstate , it is possible to construct t - odd variables using the initial ( anti)proton direction .     that can be probed using the cp / t - violating asymmetries for the trilpeton signal , at @xmath21 level , for the luminosity indicated on the plot@xcite .",
    "shaded regions are ruled out by the edm constraints . ]",
    "some of these variables are : @xmath22 and @xmath23 in the first case @xmath24 coming from the chargino decay @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 coming from the neutralino decay @xmath28 . in the case of the second variable ,",
    "the @xmath29 stand for any combination of the two momenta among the three final state leptons .",
    "the  phases also of course affect @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "[ mono - tev ] illustrates what could be achieved at the tevatron if an integrated luminosity @xmath33 were to be available .",
    "since lhc is a pp collider the initial state is not a cp eigenstate and hence a different set of variables needs to be constructed in order to probe the phases in the @xmath16 studies at the lhc .",
    "even more importantly , investigations into effects of these phases on the studies at the lhc using , say , the cascade decays , are needed and do not yet exist .",
    "such studies are essential in order to assess the feasibility of determination of the susy parameters at the lhc from sparticle phenomenology , which involve sparticle mass measurements using end point of the dilepton invariant mass spectrum .",
    "cp violation in the higgs - sector is possible only in the presence of multiple higgs doublets , the simplest one being the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) . in the cp - conserving 2hdm there",
    "exist three neutral higgs boson states : the cp - even @xmath34 and cp - odd a. in presence of cp violation all these three mix and one has three states @xmath35 , none of which have a fixed cp property .",
    "discussions of cp violation in the higgs sector and hence of cp mixing among the neutral higgs boson states in a _ model independent way _ , existed in literature  @xcite .",
    "effect of this mixing on the couplings of the mixed cp states @xmath35 with a pair of gauge bosons / fermions i.e. , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , can change the higgs phenomenology profoundly .",
    "it can be shown that various sum rules exist for these and we have for example , @xmath38 as mentioned before the  phases of susy(breaking ) parameters induce violation in the higgs sector , through loop corrections involving the third generation sfermions , even though the tree level scalar potential conserves cp .",
    "thus a cpv mssm is distinguished from a general cpv 2hdm , by the fact that the former has a prediction for the mixing in terms of susy(breaking )  phases of the mssm mentioned before .    in general the scalar potential for a 2hdm can be written as @xmath39 \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\half \\lambda_1 ( \\phi_1^{\\dagger } \\phi_1)^2 + \\half \\lambda_2 ( \\phi_2^{\\dagger } \\phi_2)^2 + \\lambda_3 ( \\phi_1^{\\dagger } \\phi_1)(\\phi_2^{\\dagger } \\phi_2 ) + \\lambda_4 ( \\phi_1^{\\dagger } \\phi_2)(\\phi_2^{\\dagger } \\phi_1 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left\\ { \\half   \\lambda_5 ( \\phi_1^{\\dagger }",
    "\\phi_2)^2 + \\left [ \\lambda_6 ( \\phi_1^{\\dagger } \\phi_1 ) + \\lambda_7 ( \\phi_2^{\\dagger } \\phi_2 ) \\right ] \\phi_1^{\\dagger } \\phi_2 + h.c .",
    "\\right\\ } \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] unitarity implies that @xmath40 , which in turn means that @xmath41 and @xmath42 . in the mssm various parameters in this potential",
    "can be expressed in terms of the gauge couplings and susy parameters @xmath43 , with @xmath44 .",
    "it can be shown in this case that any nonzero phase that @xmath45 may have can be rotated away by a redefinition of fields .",
    "thus the tree level mssm higgs potential can be cp - conserving even with nonzero phase of @xmath12 .",
    "however , at loop level , diagrams such as shown in        fig .  [ mixing_dia ]",
    "give non vanishing complex contribution to @xmath45 which can not be any more rotated away as there is no freedom of field redefinition anymore .",
    "the cp - mixing in the higgs sector can be parametrised by @xmath46  @xcite . in certain regions of susy(breaking )",
    "parameter space the  phases can also induce cp violation in the sfermion - sfermion - higgs vertex  @xcite and this in turn can give rise to edm s of fermions which depends on @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "[ edm ] shows the constraints on the phases given by the edm s for a given set of sparticle masses and susy parameters .",
    "thus if this scenario is realised one will have to choose @xmath49 values to be greater than indicated on the contours so as to satisfy the edm constraints and look at the effect of this cp - mixing on the higgs boson phenomenology .",
    "the right panel of the figure shows that it is much more difficult to achieve consistency with the data for larger values of @xmath2 . in this case",
    "the allowed regions are due to accidental susy cancellations .     in gev in the @xmath50@xmath48 plane along with the regions excluded by constraints on the edm s indicated by the shaded area  @xcite .",
    "the plot in the left panel is for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , whereas for the right panel @xmath53 , @xmath54,title=\"fig : \" ]   in gev in the @xmath50@xmath48 plane along with the regions excluded by constraints on the edm s indicated by the shaded area  @xcite .",
    "the plot in the left panel is for @xmath51 and @xmath52 , whereas for the right panel @xmath53 , @xmath54,title=\"fig : \" ]    for large values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , the loop induced cp - mixing mentioned earlier becomes dominant .",
    "in the so - called cpx scenario  @xcite , designed to showcase this mixing one chooses : @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "then the masses and couplings of the higss bosons are studied as functions of @xmath60 as well as the susy scale @xmath61 . in this case",
    "the edm constraints are easily satisfied for the chosen parameters and hence the phases @xmath62 can be varied freely . for obvious reasons the phases @xmath63 dominantly affect the masses and couplings of the mixed higgs boson states .     and @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "values of all the other relevant parameters are indicated on the figure and correspond to the case where the @xmath68 is also light with a mass @xmath69 gev  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath64 with @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "values of all the other relevant parameters are indicated on the figure and correspond to the case where the @xmath68 is also light with a mass @xmath69 gev  @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the left panel of the fig .",
    "[ mixing ] shows the masses for the lightest two higgs - boson states and the right panel shows its couplings to a pair of vector boson v. it is to be noted that the @xmath70 has an effect on the masses at two loop level and hence the dependence on it is quite weak for small values of @xmath2 .",
    "further it is also seen that for large phases of @xmath71 , @xmath72 decreases and it can even vanish for the case where @xmath73 is mostly a pseudoscalar . for larger values of @xmath74 effects of the phase @xmath70 can be significant and have been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since the production of higgs boson at all the colliders utilises its large couplings with the @xmath75 bosons as well the heavy fermions , it is clear that the above change in the couplings can affect the higgs boson phenomenology at all the colliders drastically .",
    "the non observation of a higgs boson signal in the direct searches at the lep needs to be reinterpreted in the mssm with cp violation .",
    "the recent analysis from opal  @xcite shows that indeed there are holes in the excluded region at small @xmath2 and @xmath76 in the @xmath2@xmath76 plane that are allowed with the non - observations of the signal at lep .",
    "essentially the lightest mass eigenstate is dominantly a pseduoscalar in this case and hence does not couple to a @xmath77 pair very effectively .",
    "@xmath76 plane disallowed theoretically or excluded by the current lep searches@xcite .",
    "the allowed ` hole ' at the low @xmath78 values can be seen very clearly . ]      at the tevatron and at the lhc gluon fusion provides the main production mode for the higgs .",
    "the loop induced @xmath79 coupling is dominated by the @xmath80 and @xmath81 loops .",
    "cp violation in the mssm can have effects on this loop induced coupling and thus affect the higgs production rates at the hadronic colliders .     and @xmath48@xcite .",

    "also shown are the regions disallowed by the edm constraints.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]    in fig .",
    "[ dedeshiggs ] the contours of ratios of @xmath34 production rates in the cp violating mssm to those without cp violation are shown .",
    "this corresponds to the case where the  in the mssm induces cpv @xmath86 couplings .",
    "as expected from the sum rule we find that whereas the @xmath82 production rate increase in the allowed region , the @xmath84 production rate decreases .    in case of loop induced cp mixing in the higgs sector",
    "@xcite a complete analysis involving all the three colliders lep , tevatron and lhc was performed  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the gaps in the lep coverage for small higgs masses which is already evident in the opal results of fig  [ opalexclusion ] , this figure also shows that neither the tevatron nor the lhc have reach in the same region due to a reduced @xmath87 coupling , along with a reduction in @xmath88 coupling there .",
    "thus the issue of light higgs searches at the lhc needs to be revisited for the cp violating mssm .",
    "preliminary analyses by atlas collaboration  @xcite seems to confirm this result of the theory analysis .",
    "one possible way this hole could be probed is by searching for a light @xmath73 in the decay of the charged higgs @xmath89  @xcite .",
    "the parameter space where the hole occurs corresponds to a relatively light @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) , which is predicted to decay dominantly into the @xmath91 channel .",
    "thus one expects to see a striking @xmath92 signal at the lhc , where one of the top quarks decays into the @xmath93 channel , via @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the characteristic correlation between the @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 invariant mass peaks is expected to make this signal practically free of the sm background .",
    "our parton level monte carlo simulation yields up to 4500 events , for @xmath99 fb@xmath100 , over the parameter space of interest , after taking into account the b - tagging efficiency for three or more b - tagged jets .",
    "the clustering of the invariant mass of the @xmath96 pair with the smallest value around @xmath76 and that of the @xmath101 invariant mass around @xmath102 can be seen from fig  [ ggrfig ] taken from ref .",
    "this result needs to be confirmed by experimental simulations . including detector effects .     for four values of @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the cp - violating phase @xmath105 is @xmath106 .",

    "thus we note that the possibilities of probing the cp - violating phases in the mssm in sparticle production and decays at the lhc have yet to be explored fully .",
    "these cpv phases can , in principle , affect the shape of dilepton invariant mass spectrum for the dilepton pair produced in the decay of @xmath111 and thus affect the sparticle mass determination accuracy etc .",
    "further these modifications may be a probe of the cpv phases if remaining susy parameters are known .",
    "cp conserving quantities such as cross - sections , branching ratios are sensitive to the cpv phases , but for direct measurements cpv variables need be constructed .",
    "this task has still to be done for the lhc .",
    "cp violation in mssm can affect the higgs search possibilities at the lep and lhc profoundly . for low @xmath112 and not too heavy squarks , mssm parameters can induce cpv in the @xmath113 vertex , which in turn can affect the higgs production rate through gluon fusion , by as much as a factor 10 , for values of cpv phases which are consistent with the edm constraints . in the cpx scenario",
    "@xcite chosen to showcase the in the mssm , existence of a light neutral higgs boson ( @xmath114 gev ) is allowed low @xmath115 region and could have escaped the lep searches due to a strongly suppressed @xmath116 coupling .",
    "even the lhc might miss discovering such a @xmath73 due to the suppression of the @xmath117 coupling as well .",
    "in this situation , decay of the light @xmath118 may provide a signal for the @xmath73 through its @xmath96 decay .",
