    "understanding the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , as a function of temperature @xmath11 and baryon chemical potential @xmath12 is of great interest in the phenomenology of strongly interacting dense matter @xcite .",
    "there are many excellent reviews on the subject and some recent ones can be found in @xcite .",
    "the only first principles approach to the subject is based on the lattice formulation of qcd in which one computes quantities using the monte carlo method .",
    "unfortunately , due to a variety of algorithmic difficulties this has been difficult to accomplish . at intermediate and large chemical potentials and small temperatures",
    "the numerical methods suffer from a severe sign problem .",
    "thus , the most reliable lattice calculations can only be found at small @xmath0 where reasonable algorithms are available @xcite .",
    "however , even these calculations become difficult especially for large lattices and realistic quark masses .",
    "thus , it is fair to say that quantitatively many features of the @xmath13 phase diagram of qcd still remains unclear .",
    "a recent review of the status of lattice calculations at finite temperature and density can be found in @xcite .    given the difficulties of studying the phase diagram of qcd , it is interesting to consider qcd - like theories which do not suffer from sign problems at @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the sign problem is avoided due to special properties of the fermion action which makes the fermion determinant real and positive . as a price",
    ", baryons turn out to be bosons . in spite of this difference",
    "qcd - like theories provide interesting toy models for qcd . in certain cases",
    "they are also interesting in their own right .",
    "a famous example is two - color qcd and has been extensively studied over the years both theoretically @xcite and numerically @xcite .",
    "two - color lattice qcd with staggered fermions ( 2clqcd ) is especially interesting due to an enhanced @xmath14 symmetry at zero quark mass and baryon chemical potential .",
    "as we will see later , the long distance physics of this theory in the @xmath13 plane is described by an @xmath3 ( @xmath4 when @xmath2 and @xmath5 when @xmath6 ) field theory .",
    "such field theories arise naturally in many condensed matter systems @xcite including the studies of spin and charge ordering in cuprate superconductors @xcite and superfluid transitions in @xmath15he @xcite .",
    "more concretely , the normal - to - planar superfluid phase transition in @xmath16 is governed by an @xmath17 field theory @xcite , which is similar to the one that arises in 2clqcd at @xmath2 .",
    "although some progress has been made in uncovering important qualitative features of the phase diagram of 2clqcd , many quantitative questions remain : ( 1 ) what is the order of the finite temperature chiral transition at zero and non - zero chemical potentials ? ( 2 ) can the low energy physics at small @xmath18 and @xmath0 be understood quantitatively by an appropriate chiral perturbation theory @xcite ?",
    "( 3 ) what is the order of the phase transition that occurs when the lattice gets saturated with baryons at @xmath10 ?",
    "the reason for the lack of quantitative progress can be traced to the fact that the difficulty of calculations are similar to those in qcd at zero chemical potential .",
    "hence , all previous studies have been limited to small lattice sizes and relatively large quark masses .",
    "further , diquark condensation occurs in 2clqcd and is difficult to study in the conventional approach .",
    "one usually has to add a diquark source term and then extrapolate it to zero .    fortunately , new monte carlo algorithms have emerged for lattice gauge theories in the limit of infinite gauge coupling @xcite where many of the conventional algorithmic problems disappear .",
    "although this strong coupling limit has the worst lattice artifacts , the qualitative physics is expected to be preserved . since most of the current work is being done at couplings which can be considered rather strong , the phase diagram at these couplings",
    "may not be altered significantly as compared to the infinite coupling theory . on the other hand , thanks to the new algorithms , one can study the chiral limit on large lattices with ease at infinite coupling .",
    "thus , studying strong coupling 2clqcd should be a useful step in our general understanding of the subject .",
    "the strong coupling limit attracted the attention of physicists in the eighties when a variety of qualitative results were obtained using mean field theory and numerical work @xcite .",
    "interestingly , even today many qualitative questions continue to addressed in this limit @xcite .",
    "the strong coupling limit of 2clqcd was originally considered in @xcite and has been recently reviewed in @xcite . however , many interesting questions , including the ones raised above , have remained unanswered even in this simplified limit .    in this article",
    "we extend the directed path algorithm invented in @xcite to study strong coupling 2clqcd in the chiral limit and attempt to answer many questions including those raised above .",
    "our article is organized as follows . in section [ model ]",
    "we discuss the model and the expected physics in detail . in section [ dimer ]",
    "we explain the new algorithm which is followed by a section in which we discuss the observables and how we measure them .",
    "section [ results ] contains our results which is followed by a section where we present a summary of our work along with conclusions .",

    "however there is no reason to expect this interpretation to hold at strong couplings .",
    "thus , we think of @xmath34 as merely an asymmetry factor between spatial and temporal directions .",
    "it allows us to study the effects of temperature on asymmetric lattices and was already used for this purpose in @xcite . in the dimer - baryon loop representation which we will construct later , the parameter @xmath36 is more natural . by choosing an @xmath37 lattice ( periodic in all directions ) we can study thermodynamics in the @xmath38 limit at a fixed @xmath39 by defining @xmath40 as the parameter that represents the temperature",

    "in addition all the components carry the same non - zero @xmath59 chiral charge .",
    "the above discussion makes it clear that the chiral condensate being non - zero is just a matter of choice .",
    "more generally , the ground state of the theory is such that @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is some constant unit three vector . with this choice",
    ", the ground state still remains invariant under a @xmath67 subgroup given by @xmath68 which implies that the @xmath14 symmetry is broken to a @xmath67 subgroup ( note that the @xmath67 subgroup must be a part of the @xmath28 subgroup of @xmath14 ) .",
    "when one says that the chiral condensate is non - zero , one implicitly chooses @xmath66 along the third direction .",
    "this then implies @xmath69 .",
    "however when we study the effects of the chemical potential , it is natural to pick the ground state such that @xmath70 and @xmath71 which implies that the diquark condensate , @xmath72 while the chiral condensate vanishes .",
    "note that even though @xmath73 the theory still breaks the @xmath59 symmetry since the diquark condensates carry a chiral charge .",
    "when @xmath7 the @xmath14 global symmetry is explicitly broken to @xmath55 . at small @xmath0 both the @xmath67 symmetries",
    "are expected to break spontaneously since the diquark condensate continues to be non - zero .",
    "as @xmath0 increases the density of baryons increases and at a critical value @xmath74 the lattice becomes saturated with baryons which means that for @xmath75 the diquark condensate vanishes .",
    "if this phase transition is second order , the low energy physics close to @xmath74 will be governed by a non - relativistic field theory .",
    "renormalization group arguments indicate that this field theory is governed by mean field theory in @xmath76 ( @xmath77 represents spatial dimensions ) @xcite .      at high temperatures",
    "all the symmetries are expected to be restored .",
    "this implies one must have a finite temperature phase transition for @xmath78 .",
    "the order of this transition both at @xmath2 and @xmath6 in not known .",
    "since the order parameter at @xmath2 is a complex 3-vector , its fluctuations are governed by the landau - ginzburg ( lg ) hamiltonian of the @xmath79-component complex field @xmath80 .",
    "the @xmath14 symmetry is manifest as a @xmath17 symmetry .",

    "this field theory is of interest in the study of the normal - to - planar superfluid transition in @xmath15he @xcite .",
    "the question of whether the @xmath4 theory with collinear order can be second order still remains unresolved . while the @xmath90-expansion predicts a fluctuation driven first order transition @xcite recent results claim that a second order fixed point indeed exists @xcite .",
    "as we will see later , in our work we find a weak first order transition .",
    "it is easy to argue that in the presence of the baryon chemical potential the finite temperature phase transition must be governed by a landau - ginsburg hamiltonian similar to the one above but with @xmath5 .",
    "note that the symmetry in the microscopic theory is reduced to @xmath91 which is manifest in the lg theory as an @xmath9 symmetry .",
    "further , near a finite temperature phase transition the presence of a chemical potential does not usually break charge conjugation symmetries in the low energy effective theory .",

    "it can be established that this decoupled fixed point is stable @xcite .",
    "however , the flow to this fixed point is rather slow so that corrections to the @xmath8 scaling can be substantial until one is very close to the critical point @xcite . at a non - zero value of @xmath0",
    "we indeed find a second order transition .",
    "a naive analysis indicates that the critical exponents are different from the @xmath8 exponents , however when the expected corrections to scaling are included the @xmath8 exponents can be used to fit our data .",
    "one of the computational advantages of the strong coupling limit is that in this limit it is possible to rewrite the partition function , @xmath95[d\\overline\\chi d\\chi ] \\exp(-s),\\ ] ] as a sum over configuration containing gauge invariant objects , namely monomers , dimers , and baryonloops @xcite .",
    "monomers are absent in the massless theory . in the case of 2clqcd",
    "a lattice configuration @xmath96 of dimers and baryonloops is constructed as follows : ( 1 ) every link of the lattice connecting the site @xmath22 with the neighboring site @xmath29 contains either a dimer @xmath97 or a directed baryon - bond @xmath98 .",
    "when @xmath99 , it means that the link does not contain a dimer , while @xmath100 implies that the link contains a single ( double ) dimer .",
    "similarly @xmath101 means the link does not contain a baryon - bond , while @xmath102 means the baryon - bond is directed from @xmath22 to @xmath29 and @xmath103 means it is directed from @xmath29 to @xmath22 .",
    "we will also allow @xmath104 to be negative .",
    "thus , if @xmath105 was positive , @xmath106 and @xmath107 will represent dimers and baryon - bonds connecting @xmath22 with @xmath108 .",
    "( 2 ) if a site is connected to baryon - bonds then it must have exactly one incoming baryon - bond and one outgoing baryon - bond .",
    "further it can not be connected to dimers .",
    "thus baryon - bonds always form self - avoiding closed baryonloops .",
    "( 3 ) every lattice site @xmath22 that does not contain a baryon - bond must satisfy the constraint @xmath109 where the direction @xmath105 in the sum takes negative values also .",
    "this implies that sites connected by single dimers also form a loop which we call a dimer - loop .",

    "( [ scact ] ) can be rewritten as @xcite , @xmath111 since the partition function is written as a sum over positive definite terms , a monte - carlo algorithm can in principle be designed to the study this system .",
    "however , the algorithm needs to preserve many constrains . a method to do this was developed in @xcite in the context of quantum spin models and later extended to dimer models in @xcite .",
    "we will now discuss an extension of these ideas to update the configurations @xmath96 .",
    "in particular we consider three types of updates : a dimer - baryon loop flip update , a dimer update and a baryon update .",
    "below , we discuss each of these updates in detail",
    ". remember that we assume @xmath112 .",
    "the dimer update and baryon updates have been described such that this redundant information also gets updated automatically .",
    "this update is based on the observation that every baryon loop s orientation can be flipped without violating any constraints .",
    "further a baryonloop can be converted into a dimer - loop and vice - versa .",
    "thus , every loop can be in one of three states : a dimer - loop or a baryonloop with two different orientations .",
    "let @xmath113 be the subset of lattice sites that are connected to either a dimer - loop or a baryonloop .",
    "@xmath114 will be the number of these sites .",
    "we pick a site from @xmath113 at random and change the state of the loop @xmath115 connected to that site to one of the three allowed states .",
    "the change can be accomplished using a heat - bath ( or similar ) update if we assign the following weights to the three states : a dimer - loop carries a weight @xmath35 while the baryonloop ( in either orientation ) carries the weight @xmath116 $ ] , where @xmath117 note that @xmath118 changes sign if its orientation is flipped .",
    "let @xmath119 be the set of sites connected by @xmath120 and @xmath121 be the number of such sites .",
    "the dimer update changes the configuration on a subset of @xmath119 .",
    "the update is as follows :    1 .   a lattice site @xmath122 is selected randomly 2 .",

    "this direction is picked .",
    "3 .   if the update just started and @xmath22 is the first site , a virtual monomer is created at @xmath22 . if not one is added to @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the direction from which @xmath22 was reached .",
    "one is subtracted from @xmath127 and the update moves to the neighboring site @xmath128 .",
    "we will call @xmath22 as an `` active site '' and @xmath129 as a `` passive site '' in the notation of @xcite . see next subsection for more details .",
    "with all the neighboring sites @xmath130 that belong to @xmath119 a non - zero weight @xmath131 is associated .",
    "if @xmath132 is a temporal direction then @xmath133 , otherwise @xmath134 . if the neighboring site does not belong to @xmath119 then the weight is zero . for future reference",
    "we define the total dimer weight on the site @xmath129 as @xmath135 .",
    "now based on the weights @xmath131 a heat - bath ( or similar ) procedure is used to pick a new direction @xmath132 .",

    "the update then moves to the neighboring site @xmath138 .",

    "is picked and the update moves to step 3 and with the remaining probability half the virtual monomer on the site is removed and the update ends .",
    "the third update is just a minor modification of the dimer update .",
    "let @xmath140 be the set of sites connected to @xmath141 or containing a baryonloop and @xmath142 the number of such sites .",

    "we define the total baryon weight on the site @xmath129 as @xmath150 .",

    "one is subtracted from @xmath144 and if @xmath145 after the subtraction then @xmath146 is set to 2 .",
    "the virtual diquark on the site is removed and the update ends .      in the definition of the dimer and baryon updates we have defined active and passive sites .",
    "the passive sites play an important role during the measurement of observables .",
    "hence we clarify these two class of sites further .",
    "both the dimer and baryon updates are directed loop updates .",
    "they start on a site @xmath22 , which is called an active site .",
    "then they go through a series of sites which are referred to as passive and active alternately .",
    "thus the second site is a passive site , the third is an active site and so on . if the first site is such that @xmath152 then all passive sites @xmath129 , visited during the update , have @xmath153 and vice - versa .",
    "the weights @xmath154 and @xmath155 for passive sites encountered during the updates will play an special role in the measurement of correlation functions as discussed below .",
    "each of the three updates satisfy detailed balance .",
    "the proof of detailed balance for the the dimer - baryon loop flip update is straight forward and conventional . on the other hand the proofs for the dimer and baryon updates",
    "need some understanding of directed loop algorithms .",
    "once this is clear , the proof is essentially straight forward .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and do not prove detailed balance of these two algorithms in this article .",
    "the combination of the three updates makes the algorithm ergodic . to see this",
    "we note that there is always possible to flip all the baryonloops into dimer - loops .",
    "once this is done one can use the proof given in @xcite to show that dimer updates are ergodic in the space of configurations that purely consist of dimers .",
    "a variety of observables can be measured with our algorithm .",

    "again @xmath74 is in excellent agreement with the mean field result which provides strong evidence that the phase transition is second order and belongs to the mean field universality class . from the behavior of @xmath311 and @xmath328 we find @xmath336 .",
    "in this work we constructed an efficient cluster algorithm and studied the phase structure of two color lattice qcd with massless staggered fermions in the strong coupling limit .",
    "we found that the finite temperature phase transition at zero chemical potential is weakly first order , while the same transition at an intermediate value of the chemical potential was second order .",
    "this second order transition was found to be in the universality class of the three dimensional @xmath8 model as expected from theoretical arguments .",
    "however , in order to show this we needed to include the large corrections to scaling expected in the theory .",
    "the quantum phase transition at zero temperature between a baryon superfluid phase and a normal phase was also found to be second order in the mean field universality class .",
    "the physics in the normal phase was that of interacting non - relativistic particles .",

    "however , for couplings that are currently explored , universality arguments suggest that the phase diagram will qualitatively remain the same although quantitatively the values of the critical points will mostlikely get affected .",
    "it is also interesting to ask why the transition at @xmath2 is so weak . as discussed in section [ model ] ,",
    "renormalization group studies based on the @xmath90-expansion indicate that the transition will generically be a fluctuation driven first order transition @xcite .",
    "such a transition could be weak as we observe .",
    "on the other hand , recent work based on high order perturbation theory combined with resummation techniques do not rule out the possibility of a second order transition @xcite .",
    "this means we are in the vicinity of a tricritical point and by changing some parameter in the theory we could change the transition to second order .",
    "when this occurs , it is likely that the weakly first order line in the above phase diagram will disappear .",
    "such a scenario can in principle be investigated by introducing more tunable parameters within our model and by studying their effects on the order of the transition .",
    "it is amusing to note that the above phase diagram is different from the standard phase diagram in qcd where the baryon chemical potential induces a first order transition instead of weakening it .",
    "this non - standard scenario was discussed in @xcite as a possibility in qcd and has also been seen in the potts model simulations @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that the physics close to the quantum critical point is also interesting from the point of view of non - relativistic field theory .",
    "since the model has a @xmath91 symmetry , the low energy effective field theory here is richer than in a theory with a simple @xmath67 particle number symmetry .",
