    "most recent tdhf simulations include the spin - orbit force  @xcite and break all the symmetries ( plane and axis symmetries generally assumed to speed up calculations ) .",
    "moreover , all the terms of the skyrme edf used in nuclear structure can now be included  @xcite . the possibility to perform full three - dimensional calculations and",
    "to use effective forces consistent with nuclear structure is crucial to account for the richness of nuclear shapes that are accessed dynamically .",
    "in addition , the great interest of dynamical mean - field theories with respect to other methods is that many effects which are known to affect fusion such as dynamical deformation , nucleon exchange , and nuclear incompressibility are automatically incorporated .",

    "in this section , the extraction of nucleus - nucleus interaction potentials from mean - field theories is discussed . in macroscopic models , these potentials are generally displayed as a function of a few macroscopic collective degrees of freedom describing , e.g. , the relative distance , shapes of nuclei , mass asymmetry . here",

    "the great interest of edf theory is that the initial complicated many - body problem is replaced by an independent particle problem .",
    "indeed , the minimization procedure is equivalent to find the set of single - particle states that diagonalizes both the self - consistent mean - field defined through the relation @xmath13_{ij } = \\partial { \\cal e } [ \\hat\\rho ] / \\partial \\rho_{ji}$ ] and the one - body density . at the minimum",

    "the step size in the coordinate space is 0.8  fm .",
    "then , we calculate the time evolution of the colliding nuclei in the three - dimensional mesh .",
    "the time step is 0.45  fm / c and the initial distance is set between 16    22.4  fm , depending on reaction .",
    "we assume that the colliding nuclei follow the rutherford trajectory before they reach the initial distance for tdhf .",

    "overlap of the two densities is small and pauli effect is expected to be accordingly small .",
    "it should however be kept in mind that a proper account of the pauli principle would lead to an increase of the potential for small relative distances .",
    "the fd approximation is expected to break down if strong reorganization of internal one - body degrees of freedom occurs in the approaching phase . in the following ,",
    "methods to extract nucleus - nucleus potential directly from tdhf without assuming frozen densities are discussed .",
    "the first step is to properly define the collective coordinate @xmath10 that separates the two sub - systems . here , we follow macroscopic models and define the plane of separation at the neck position . in practice ,",
    "the neck position is obtained by considering the two densities @xmath28 where @xmath29 ( resp .",

    "this figure illustrates that the separation plane corresponds to the geometrical neck as generally defined in leptodermous systems .",

    "since we are considering head - on collisions along x - axis , the center - of - mass coordinate @xmath39 and associated momentum @xmath40 express as @xmath41 we can also compute the inertial mass of the two sub - systems , denoted by @xmath42 , from the tdhf evolution using @xmath43 .",
    "once these quantities are obtained , the tdhf dynamics can be reduced to the two - body collision problem where the relative distance @xmath44 , associated momentum @xmath45 , and reduced mass @xmath46 are computed at each time step .",

    "it is worth mentioning that , while for symmetric reactions @xmath52 remains constant during the collision , for asymmetric case @xmath52 may vary after the contact , i.e. , @xmath53 .",
    "the critical discussion on the possible influence of this variation on extracted potentials is presented in sec .",
