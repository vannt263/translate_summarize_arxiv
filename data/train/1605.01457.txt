    "albeit a conclusive model for the crossover from a double - channel to a single - channel transport behavior is currently missing , there are first studies which point into the right direction . a recent paper by chu and he @xcite claims to explain our findings .",
    "it turns out that a @xmath95 distortion of carbon atoms at the gnr edges induces a large spin - orbit coupling .",
    "the formation of metallic edge states in zigzag ribbons has been confirmed by many calculations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thereby , the channels with same direction of propagation and opposite spin are located at opposite edges of the ribbon . in general , details of the interaction of the edges",
    "are crucial and easily lift the spin - degeneracy .",
    "indeed , transmission electron microscopy showed that particularly the lower edge of the ribbon is covalently bond to the lower sic(0001 ) terrace @xcite .",
    "this can have severe implications to the electronic band structure .",
    "first of all , the vertical merging of the edge in to the sic substrate is accompanied by in - place electric fields which were theoretically shown to affect the spin - texture of the states @xcite",
    ". moreover , curvature effects are present which are known to induce pseudo - magnetic fields @xcite .",
