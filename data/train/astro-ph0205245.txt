    "the recent growing evidences for a vacuum energy component in the universe @xcite have lead to the development of a number of models , most of which tend to alleviate the theoretical difficulties of the well known `` cosmological constant problem '' ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "all these models are replacing the cosmological constant with a `` dynamical vacuum energy '' provided by an evolving scalar field , often named `` quintessence '' .",
    "this field should provide the present cosmic accelerating phase through its negative equation of state .",
    "such `` dark energy '' component has also been modeled in the general framework of scalar - tensor theories of gravity : in these `` extended quintessence '' ( eq ) scenarios @xcite-@xcite , the quintessence scalar field is directly coupled to the ricci scalar @xmath0 in the lagrangian of the theory : the canonical ricci scalar term @xmath1 , with @xmath2 , is replaced by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a function of the quintessence field @xmath5 . here",
    ", @xmath6 is a `` bare '' gravitational constant , generally different from the newton s constant g as it is measured by cavendish - type experiments @xcite . in eq models ,",
    "a scalar field has thus a double role : at any epoch , its value determines the effective gravitational constant , and the contribution in dark energy density .",
    "of course , such a coupling is not arbitrary : it is instead subject to a number of constraints , mainly arising from the bounds on the time variations of the constants of nature , which must be taken into account .",
    "eq scenarios have been analyzed from different points of view , and there are robust predictions about their possible imprints on the power spectrum of cmb anisotropies @xcite . however , the important role of dark energy in modern cosmology opens the question of its relation with the other main dark component currently under investigation , the dark matter .",
    "one major point with quintessence scenarios is whether a dark energy component could affect , in some way , the formation of dark matter clumps . in particular , one fundamental question is : can the dark energy itself form clumps on certain scales ?",
    "if we restrict ourselves to minimally - coupled scalar fields , we have to deal with a very relativistic component : indeed , the sound speed of such component turns out to be identical to that of radiation @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "an `` ordinary '' ( i.e. , minimally coupled ) quintessence component becomes homogeneous on scales smaller than the horizon , as its energy density perturbations are rapidly damped out .",
    "for this reason , clumps of `` ordinary '' quintessence can not form on such scales . in eq scenarios , however , the situation can dramaticaly change , since the physical properties of an eq are deeply modified with respect to those of an ordinary quintessence field @xcite , as is the case for its effective sound speed ; one natural question is whether dark energy structures could form in these scenarios , starting from initial small overdensities in the linear regime . in order to give an answer to this question",
    ", we start from a definition of the stress - energy tensor @xmath7 of the quintessence field , which includes a term of purely gravitational origin , in addition to the standard contributions from minimal coupling and non - minimal coupling @xcite : @xmath8 = t_{\\mu \\nu}^{mc}[\\phi]+   t_{\\mu \\nu}^{nmc}[\\phi ] + t_{\\mu \\nu}^{grav}[\\phi ] \\ \\ , \\ ] ] with @xmath9 = \\left ( { 1\\over \\kappa}-f\\right ) g_{\\mu \\nu}\\ .\\ ] ] the so - defined stress - energy tensor of the quintessence field is a conserved quantity , as a consequence of the contracted bianchi identities ; drawing the scalar field energy density @xmath10 from this tensor , it will satisfy the continuity equation .",
    "most importantly , also in @xmath10 we can distinguish the gravitational contribution from the others , analogously to the separation performed into @xmath11 : @xmath12 in the last expression , @xmath13 is the conformal expansion rate , and @xmath14 is the scalar field potential .",
    "let us focus on the last term in the rhs of this equation : noticeably , when @xmath15 , the gravitational contribution to @xmath10 switches on , feeding @xmath10 with a term proportional to the total energy density of the universe via @xmath16 .",
    "in practice , the quintessence energy density is dragged by the energy density of the dominant component at any epoch : this effect , which we call `` gravitational dragging '' , is also active on the time evolution of the perturbations .",
    "indeed , we could perform an analogous division between the various contributions to the scalar field density contrast @xmath17 , finding @xmath18 being the gravitational contribution @xcite @xmath19 looking at this expression , it is evident that the quintessence field density contrast can be non - vanishing even when the quintessence field is homogeneous by itself , provided @xmath20 ; in this case , indeed , @xmath21 is sourced by the @xmath22 term , containing the total cosmic fluid energy density perturbations , which are generally non vanishing .",
    "while the scalar field perturbations @xmath23 contribute to @xmath24 and @xmath25 only , the ricci scalar perturbations are responsible for the gravitational contribution to @xmath21 ; the latter can dominate the dynamics of @xmath21 whenever @xmath26 are negligible and @xmath20 .",
    "in other words , the gravitational dragging mechanism forces the scalar field perturbations to behave as the density perturbations of the dominant cosmic fluid component : noticeably , in the matter dominated era , an eq field can even behave as pressureless dark matter , thanks to the explicit coupling netween @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "the quintessence field overdensities receive an injection of power which may potentially enhance them up to the exit from the linear regime , following the matter behaviour . in fig .",
    "[ powerspectrum ] we plot the logarithmic power of density fluctuations , defined in the fourier space as @xmath27 , both for cdm perturbations and for eq perturbations , in a specific example with @xmath28 ( where @xmath29 is an observationally constrained coupling constant ) .",
    "note that , at the present time , the quantity @xmath30 reduces to @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the field value at @xmath33 ) , which is generally a non - vanishing term .",
    "the plots in figure [ powerspectrum ] refers to redshifts @xmath34 and @xmath35 ; because of the gravitational dragging , linear perturbations in the quintessence energy density are close to those in the cdm component up to redshifts relevant for structure formation , while they appear to decrease at @xmath36 , when the quintessence field comes to dominate the expansion and the term @xmath37 is no more the dominant term in the denominator of @xmath38 .",
    "however , scales on which perturbations reached the non - linear regime at some redshift are no more adequately described by the linear approach . at that point",
    ", it is quite obvious that a non - linear approach is required to further investigate the quintessence perturbation evolution .",
    "+ the same result can be obtained with a different approach , based on the properties of the `` effective sound speed '' @xmath39 of a fluid @xcite : such a quantity , defined as the sound speed in the fluid rest frame , encloses both the adiabatic and entropic contributions to the sound speed , and it well characterizes the total pressure response to the gravitational collapse . while it is equal to the speed of light for minimally - coupled scalar fields , it turns out to be a scalar field dependend quantity in eq models ; in the gravitational dragging regime , the effective sound speed is inversely proportional to @xmath21 , which can be at the level of perturbations in the cdm component , resulting in low values of @xmath39 . also the sign of @xmath39 may be reversed , depending on the sign of the coupling constant , strongly modifying the response of pressure to the variation in the energy density , and radically changing the gravitational collapse scenario for the quintessence component .",
    "the fact that the quintessence sound speed gets strongly modified by the coupling to the ricci scalar , a result which is analogous to the gravitational dragging mechanism described above , allows for the possibility of quintessence clumps ; the characteristic scales for this process have not been investigated yet , and the further evolution of quintessence energy density perturbations in the non - linear regime deserve a future investigation .",
    "the intriguing possibility of the gravitational dragging of matter perturbations on quintessence perturbations is one of the possible grounds where to probe the relation between dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) . in recent years",
    ", the possibility of de clumps formation , the stability of spherically symmetric scalar field structures and their relation to the dm component in galaxies , have received increasing attention @xcite . in the scenario here proposed , such relation can only be of gravitational type , and may possibly be detected on the galactic scales .",
    "the question of how the dm is distributed inside dark halos and cluster is still matter of debate .",
    "for example , it is still unknown whether the dark halos density profile is universal , or it depends on properties of the galaxy itself .",
    "kinematic properties , such as rotation curves of disk galaxies , are an excellent probe for dm on galactic scales ; it has been shown that independent high - resolution optical rotation curves observations , can probe the halo mass distribution and resolve their structure .",
    "an important contribution has been obtained @xcite by the analysis of low - luminosity late - type spirals ; the surprising result of this analysis has been that the halo velocity profiles increase linearly with the radius , at least up to the stellar disk edge ( the  visible galaxy \" ) .",
    "this implies that , over all the stellar disk , the dark halo density is about a constant ; similar properties were previously found also for dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies , which are both dm objects @xcite .",
    "the presence of a constant density central core is in contrast with the cdm scenario , which predicts a steeply cusped density distribution in the same region .",
    "the presence of a central singularity in the density profile of dm has to be excluded also as a result of the analysis of gravitational lensing on the cluster scales .",
    "this disparity between the model and the data on the galaxy rotation curves requires the introduction of different fields and/or particles , including the de as a candidate .",
    "indeed , this disparity follows directly from the nature of collisionless particles , which have no physically associated length scale , with the result that dm halos should have zero effective core radii @xcite . in order to generate cores in the dm distribution , additional physical properties",
    "are required , such as could be provided by hot dark matter ( in this case , the central density may be naturally limited by phase space constraints ) or an universe dominated by dissipative baryonic matter .",
    "even though these models have to be excluded because they fail in accounting for the observed large scale structure , they are both able to provide a mechanism that limits the central density of the cdm particles , introducing a characteristic scale . in this context",
    ", it is extremely interesting the question of how , and whether , the de has a key role into the structure of the dm halos .",
    "if this is the case , we expect that this role is based on the purely gravitational interaction between dm and de , which may imply a redistribution of dm in the halos , particularly in the central core .",
    "the gravitational dragging mechanism described above opens new perspectives on the relation between dm and de in collapsed structures , from galactic scales to the scales of galaxy clusters .",
    "in particular , predictions for the galactic rotation curves in eq models should be drawn and compared to observations .",
    "a non - linear approach to the perturbation growth in gravitational dragging regime will allow to check for the possibility of constant density central cores in galaxies , and for determining the characteristic scales of eventual quintessence clumps .                                          c. wetterich , phys.lett .",
