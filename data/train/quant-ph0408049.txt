    "the study of time - dependent solutions of the schrdinger equation for initial wave packets of gaussian form has a long history , dating back to the earliest days of the development of quantum theory .",
    "schrdinger himself @xcite and others @xcite - @xcite used such solutions to discuss the connections between the quantum and classical formulations of mechanics and found explicit wave packet solutions to many of the standard problems of classical mechanics , including the free - particle , case of uniform acceleration , the harmonic oscillator , and the particle in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "these examples first appeared in a number of textbooks @xcite - @xcite less than a decade later .",
    "in contrast , many treatments of introductory quantum mechanics today focus almost exclusively on time - independent , energy eigenstate ( or stationary state ) solutions of the schrdinger equation , although a large number of texts do include the explicit construction of a time - dependent gaussian wave packet solution for the free - particle case .",
    "this easily obtained , analytic result ( seemingly first obtained by darwin @xcite ) illustrates , in a closed form solution , many of the notions central to wave packet spreading and the essentially classical time - development of the expectation value as @xmath1 . in many modern software packages ,",
    "these solutions are also visualized , helping to illustrate the correlated time - development of the real and imaginary parts , and especially their phase relationships , often using a popular color - coding scheme @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an example of a static image representing such time - development is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "one can easily note the non - symmetric pattern of the ` wiggliness ' apparent for @xmath2 in both the real ( dotted ) and imaginary ( dashed ) parts of @xmath3 , which , as we will argue below , can be used as a qualitative measure of the local kinetic energy .",
    "the faster ( higher momentum , and hence ` wigglier ' ) components are more obviously associated with the ` front end ' of the spreading wave packet , while the ` back end ' exhibits much less rapid spatial variation , consistent with the slower ( low momentum ) components trailing behind .    in this note , we attempt to extend and amplify upon this type of intuitive observation and try to answer such questions as _ where is the kinetic energy localized in a wave packet ? _ to this end , we begin with the familiar observation that the expectation value of the kinetic energy operator in any time - dependent position - space state , @xmath3 , can be written , using a simple integration - by - parts ( or ibp ) argument , in the form @xmath4 or @xmath5 where the ` boundary terms ' ( involving @xmath6 and @xmath7 at @xmath8 ) are assumed to vanish for any appropriately localized solution .",
    "this global identification suggests that we define a local _ kinetic energy density _ , @xmath9 , via @xmath10 this quantity , which is clearly locally real and positive - definite , can then be used to quantify the distribution of kinetic energy , and how it changes with time , for any time - dependent solution of the schrdinger equation . for gaussian solutions",
    ", we will be able to perform many of the desired integrals in closed form , leading to explicit analytic results for such related quantities as @xmath11 where the expectation value @xmath12 serves to define the ` center ' of the wave packet .",
    "these quantities can be respectively associated with the kinetic energy in the ` right ' ( or ` front ' , at least for packets moving generally to the right ) half and the ` left ' ( or ` back ' ) half of the wave packet .    in",
    "what follows , we will present several explicit closed - form examples of the calculation of @xmath13 for gaussian wave packet solutions , starting in sec .",

    "iv we use standard propagator techniques to examine gaussian wave packet solutions for the harmonic oscillator problem in this context , while in sec .",
    "v we extend these results to the case of an ` inverted oscillator ' , corresponding to a particle in unstable equilibrium .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation for the one - dimensional free particle case can be written , and easily solved , in either position- or momentum - space in the equivalent forms @xmath14 since we will find the momentum - space approach more useful in sec .",
    "[ sec_uniform_acceleration ] for the case of uniform acceleration , we will also use that approach here and write @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the initial momentum distribution . using this very general form , and the appropriate operator form of @xmath17",

    "the limiting values are then @xmath38 which have the extremal values @xmath39 which occur when @xmath40 thus , as much as @xmath0 of the total kinetic energy of this gaussian wave packet solution can be in the ` front half ' of the wave at long times ( i.e. those for which @xmath41 . )    to illustrate this effect , we plot in the left column of fig .  2 , the modulus ( @xmath42 , solid ) , and real ( dotted ) and imaginary ( dashed ) parts of a typical solution corresponding to @xmath43 ( top ) , @xmath44 ( the extremal value , middle ) , and @xmath45 ( bottom ) for long times ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the values are plotted in terms of the variable @xmath47 for easier comparison . for the @xmath48 case ,",
    "it is clear that the larger momentum components ( in magnitude ) spread faster , but uniformly , in the opposite @xmath49 and @xmath50 directions , giving equal ` wiggliness ' on each side , while for large values of @xmath20 , the total kinetic energy is clearly increased ( many more ` wiggles ' everywhere ) , but the amount on each side of the expectation value peak at @xmath12 is roughly the same . for the extremal value of @xmath44",
    ", there is the clearest distinction between the ` front ' and ` back ' halves , as the magnitudes of the momentum components in the ` back ' half are at a minimum , resulting in the greatest separation between the kinetic energy in the two halves .",
    "we can also compare the distribution of probability , described as usual by @xmath51 , to how the kinetic energy is localized .",
    "the kinetic energy density , @xmath9 , can be scaled to the total ( and possibly time - dependent ) value of @xmath52 via @xmath53 and so is normalized in the same way as the probability density .",
    "we plot both @xmath54 ( solid curve ) and @xmath55 ( dot - dashed curve ) in the right hand column of fig .  2 for the same three cases considered above and we note how the shape of @xmath55 is correlated with the obvious ` wiggliness ' shown in the real and imaginary parts of @xmath3 .",
    "the problem of a particle under the influence of a constant force is a staple in classical mechanics , and was considered early in the history of quantum mechanics @xcite , but is less often discussed in introductory treatments of the subject , especially in terms of time - dependent solutions .",
    "for that reason , we briefly review the most straightforward momentum - space approach to this problem . in this case , where the potential is given by @xmath56 , we can write the time - dependent schrdinger equation in momentum - space as @xmath57 \\phi(p , t ) = i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\phi(p , t)}{\\partial t } \\label{pspace}\\ ] ] or @xmath58 we note that the simple combination of derivatives guarantees that a function of the form @xmath59 will make the left - hand side vanish , so we assume a solution of the form @xmath60 , with @xmath61 arbitrary and @xmath62 to be determined .",

    "because the @xmath69 terms cancel in the exponential , we will be able to explicitly integrate gaussian type initial momentum - space waveforms .    for any general initial @xmath70",
    "we now have the time - dependent expectation values @xmath71 which also give the expectation value @xmath72 which , in turn , also agrees with a similar calculation of @xmath73 using @xmath74 , all of which are consistent with a particle undergoing uniform acceleration .    using the standard initial gaussian momentum - space wavefunction in eqn .",

    "<S> using gaussian wave packet solutions , we examine how the kinetic energy is distributed in time - dependent solutions of the schrdinger equation corresponding to the cases of a free particle , a particle undergoing uniform acceleration , a particle in a harmonic oscillator potential , and a system corresponding to an unstable equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we find , for specific choices of initial parameters , that as much as @xmath0 of the kinetic energy can be localized ( at least conceptually ) in the ` front half ' of such gaussian wave packets , and we visualize these effects . </S>"
