    "the lick system @xcite defines absorption - line indices at medium resolution ( @xmath18   ) that can be used  through the comparison with stellar population models  to derive ages and metallicities of stellar systems .",
    "interestingly , the indices @xmath9and @xmath19  of early - type galaxies yield higher metallicities ( and younger ages ) than the indices fe5270 and fe5335 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; and others ) .",
    "the most straightforward qualitative interpretation of these strong mg - indices and/or weak fe - indices is that the stellar populations in elliptical galaxies have high mg / fe element ratios ( or @xmath8  ratios if mg is taken as representative of @xmath20-elements ) with respect to the solar values @xcite .",
    "this finding strongly impacts on the theory of galaxy formation , as super - solar @xmath8  ratios require short star formation time - scales ( @xmath21  gyr , @xcite ; @xcite ) , that are not achieved by current models of hierarchical galaxy formation @xcite .",
    "however , there exist two major caveats about this conclusion .",
    "1 ) lick indices have very broadly defined line windows ( @xmath22   ) .",
    "each index actually contains a large number of absorption features from various elements , so that the direct translation into element abundances is not very straightforward @xcite .",
    "2 ) the stellar library @xcite used in stellar population models to compute lick indices contains only very few stars with metallicities above solar .",
    "an additional complication is that in these libraries @xmath8  is not independent of @xmath23  ( see section  [ sec : bias ] ) .    in order to resolve these ambiguities , @xcite compare the lick indices of simple stellar population ( ssp ) models with data of metal - rich globular clusters of the galactic bulge @xcite ,",
    "the ages and and element abundances of which are known from high - resolution stellar spectroscopy .",
    "they find that metal - rich , @xmath8enhanced bulge clusters show the same features as early - type galaxies : their mg indices are stronger than predicted by ssp models at a given fe index value .",
    "this result is empirical evidence that mg and fe indices indeed trace @xmath8  element ratios . @xcite",
    "verify the uniqueness of interpreting the strong mg indices and weak fe indices in elliptical galaxies in terms of mg over fe element overabundance .",
    "they show that alternative explanations like uncertainties in stellar evolution and ssp modelling , or a significant steepening of the initial mass function ( imf ) do either not reproduce the observed indices or violate other observational constraints . @xcite",
    "further show that the standard models reflect variable element abundance ratios at the various metallicities , in particular super - solar @xmath8  ratios at sub - solar metallicities .    motivated by these results ,",
    "we construct stellar population models for various and well - defined element abundance ratios .",
    "we present the whole set of lick indices ( @xmath10 , @xmath11 , ca4227 , g4300 , fe4383 , ca4455 , fe4531 , @xmath134668 , @xmath24 , fe5015 , @xmath12 , @xmath19 , @xmath9 , fe5270 , fe5335 , fe5406 , fe5709 , fe5782 , na  d , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ) of ssp models with the @xmath8  ratios @xmath3=0.0,\\:0.3,\\:0.5 $ ] .",

    "the present models now allow for the unambiguous derivation of ssp ages , metallicities , and element abundance , in particular @xmath8 , ratios .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section  [ sec : construction ] we describe the construction of the models , and introduce the main input parameters . in section  [ sec : calibration ] we present the model results and their calibration with globular cluster data .",
    "if the reader is predominantly interested in the application of the present ssp models , for the first reading we recommend to skip section  [ sec : construction ] , and to focus on the summary given in section  [ sec : modelsum ] .",
    "the models for selected ages are provided in the tables in the appendix .",
    "their complete versions are available electronically via ftp at ftp.mpe.mpg.de in the directory people / dthomas / ssps , via www at ftp://ftp.mpe.mpg.de/people/dthomas/ssps , or email to dthomas@mpe.mpg.de .",
    "the classical input parameters for stellar population models are the slope of the imf , the age and the metallicity with fixed ( solar ) element abundance proportions . in this paper",
    ", we introduce the abundances of individual elements as a further parameter , allowing for various element mixtures at given total metallicity .",
    "the new ssp models are based on the standard ssp models computed with the code of @xcite . for lick indices",

    "introduce the main input parameters .",
    "the underlying ssp models are presented in @xcite and c.  maraston ( in preparation ) . in these models ,",
    "the fuel consumption theorem @xcite is adopted to evaluate the energetics of the post main sequence phases . the input stellar tracks ( solar abundance ratios ) with metallicities from 1/200 to 2 solar , are taken from @xcite , @xcite , and s.  cassisi ( 1999 , private communication ) .",
    "the tracks with 3.5 solar metallicity are taken from @xcite .",

    "the resulting uncertainties in the modelling are discussed in @xcite and @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on the fitting function of @xcite , because they comprise all 21 lick absorption line indices .",
    "our models adopt a @xcite imf slope .",
    "the aim is to obtain ssp models with various and well - defined element abundance ratios at fixed total metallicity .",
    "the most important ratio is @xmath8 , which is the ratio of the so - called @xmath20-elements ( n , o , mg , ca , na , ne , s , si , ti ) to the fe - peak elements ( cr , mn , fe , co , ni , cu , zn ) , because it carries information on the formation time - scale of stellar populations ( see the introduction ) .      to enhance the abundance ratio @xmath8  keeping the total metallicity constant , the increase in the abundances of the @xmath20-elements has to be counterbalanced by the decrease of fe - peak element abundances . following t00 s notation , we call the former enhanced group and the latter depressed group .",
    "we keep the abundance of carbon fixed , as in the solar neighbourhood carbon appears less enhanced than the @xmath20-elements @xcite .",
    "t00 include a model in which carbon is assigned to the depressed group .",
    "we tested this option , and found that the depression of carbon leads to serious inconsistencies between models and globular cluster data of the indices @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath134668 , and @xmath12  ( see section  [ sec : calibration ] , t00 ) .",
    "all elements heavier than zn are assumed not to vary .",
    "our prescriptions are identical to t00 s model  1 , except that we include the @xmath20-element calcium in the enhanced group .",
    "this choice is motivated by the evidence that in halo and disc of our galaxy the element calcium follows the typical abundance patterns of the other @xmath20-elements like oxygen and magnesium @xcite .",
    "t00 , instead , assign calcium to the depressed elements , because elliptical galaxies have low ca4227 and ca4455 indices @xcite . in a separate model we explored this case .",
    "we verified that the resulting ssp models of none of the 21 indices  except ca4227are significantly different when calcium is assigned either to the enhanced or the depressed group , simply because only ca4227 is sensitive to calcium abundance ( tb95 ) .",
    "curiously , ca4455 is completely insensitive to the element calcium ( tb95 ) .",
    "moreover , the fractional contribution of ca to the total metallicity is too small ( @xmath31 per cent ) to change the isochrone and ssp characteristics .",
    "the starting point is a total metallicity in which the mass fractions of the enhanced and depressed groups are @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively .",
    "its @xmath8  ratio normalized to the solar value @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35=\\log\\left(\\frac{x^+}{x^-}\\right ) - \\log\\left(\\frac{x^+_{\\odot}}{x^-_{\\odot}}\\right)\\ . \\label{eqn:1}\\ ] ] in order to obtain a new chemical mixture with the same total metallicity , we change @xmath32 and @xmath33 by the factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 , respectively , such that the new @xmath8  is @xmath35_{\\rm new } = \\log\\left(\\frac{f_{\\alpha}}{f_{\\rm fe}}\\right ) + \\log\\left(\\frac{x^+}{x^-}\\right ) - \\log\\left(\\frac{x^+_{\\odot}}{x^-_{\\odot}}\\right)\\ . \\label{eqn:2}\\ ] ]    the conservation of total metallicity requires the following condition @xmath38 or , dividing by @xmath33 , @xmath39 from equations  [ eqn:1 ] to [ eqn:3 ] the factors @xmath36 and @xmath37 can be determined for given [ @xmath8 ] and @xmath3_{\\rm new}$ ] .",
    "from @xcite we adopt : @xmath41 ( solar oxygen abundance @xmath42 ) , @xmath43 , and total solar metallicity @xmath44 . with these values , a new abundance ratio @xmath3_{\\rm new}=0.3 $ ] starting from the solar values",
    "@xmath3=0 $ ] ( i.e. increasing @xmath8  by a factor of 2 ) is obtained with @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "thus , as also emphasized by t00 , super - solar @xmath8  ratios at fixed total metallicity are produced by a decrease of the fe abundance rather than by an increase of the @xmath20-element abundances .",
    "the reason for this effect is that the @xmath20-element oxygen is the most abundant element in the sun after hydrogen and helium , so that total metallicity is by far dominated by oxygen ( 48 per cent by mass ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath20-elements contribute 26 per cent , the fe - peak elements only 8 per cent to the total amount of metals in the sun .",
    "the following notation will be used throughout this paper .",
    "we distinguish between total metallicity [ @xmath47 , iron abundance [ @xmath23 ] , and @xmath20-element to iron ratio [ @xmath8 ] .",
    "only two of these quantities are independent .",
    "following @xcite and t00 , they can be related through the following equation .",
    "[ { \\ensuremath{\\alpha/{\\rm fe } } } ] \\label{eqn : fescaling}\\ ] ] with @xmath50}{\\delta[{\\ensuremath{\\alpha/{\\rm fe}}}]}\\ ] ] the factor @xmath51 depends on the partition between enhanced and depressed elements .",
    "for our adopted mixtures ( see previous section ) we obtain @xmath52 . for more details see t00 .",
    "both nitrogen and calcium are assigned to the enhanced group .",
    "therefore , the ratios @xmath29  and @xmath30  are fixed to the solar value ( @xmath5=0,\\ [ { \\ensuremath{\\alpha/{\\rm ca}}}]=0 $ ] ) in the @xmath8  enhanced mixtures described in the previous section .",
    "we computed additional models with chemical mixtures in which nitrogen and calcium are detached from the group of enhanced elements and their abundances are allowed to vary with respect to the abundances of the other @xmath20-elements .",
    "we computed a model in which nitrogen is enhanced by a factor 3 with respect to the other @xmath20-elements , hence @xmath5=-0.5 $ ] , and various models in which calcium is depressed with respect to the other @xmath20-elements , hence @xmath4=0.1 , -0.2 , -0.5 $ ] .",
    "note that the fractional contribution of the elements nitrogen and calcium to total metallicity is only @xmath53 and 0.3 per cent , respectively .",
    "the different @xmath29  and @xmath30  ratios are therefore achieved essentially by changing the abundances of the elements n and ca , and the perturbation of the total metallicity budget is negligible .",
    "the account for the impact from abundance variations of individual elements on the absorption line - strengths is the principal ingredient of models with variable element abundances . in the models of this paper ,",
    "the variation of the lick absorption line indices owing to element abundance changes is taken from tb95 as described below .",
    "tb95 computed model atmospheres and synthetic spectra along a 5  gyr old isochrone with solar metallicity . on these model atmospheres",
    "they assess the impact on lick indices from element abundance variations .",
    "the model atmospheres have well - defined values of temperature and gravity , chosen to be representative of the three evolutionary phases , dwarfs ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 ) , turnoff ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) and giants ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "these couples of @xmath60  and @xmath61 are very appropriately chosen .",
    "the giant model , for instance , is placed at a location of the isochrone where most of the fuel is burned ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tbphases ] ) , i.e.  at the base of the red giant branch and on the horizontal branch @xcite . for instance , a reference model for giants with a much lower gravity would have overestimated the effect on the mg indices , which are very strong at very low gravity and temperature .    at different metallicities and ages , the three evolutionary phases are in principle represented by slightly different couples of @xmath60  and @xmath61 .",
    "the effect is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tbphases ] , where couples of isochrones ( with ages 5 and 15 gyr ) at various metallicities ( see references in the caption ) are plotted in the @xmath60  versus @xmath61 plane .",
    "the star symbols denote the dwarfs , turnoff and giants locations defined by tb95 .",
    "the larger the metallicity , the closer is the dwarf - border to the turnoff , and vice versa .",
    "the turnoff is hotter at decreasing age or metallicity , but the gravity keeps rather constant around @xmath62 . fig .  [",
    "fig : tbphases ] shows that the phases are rather well defined independent of age and metallicity .",
    "we use the fixed temperature of 5000  k to separate the turnoff region from the cool dwarfs on the main sequence , independent of age and metallicity . in order to assess quantitatively the impact of this choice",
    ", we computed the integrated indices of the most metal - rich ssp adopting 4000  k instead of 5000  k. we find that the resulting ssp indices change by only @xmath31 per cent .",
    "the impact is so small because for standard imfs dwarfs with these temperatures play a minor role in the integrated indices @xcite .",
    "we assign the subgiant branch phase to the turnoff because of the very similar @xmath60  and @xmath63 .",
    "the evolutionary phase ` giants ' consists of the red giant branch , the horizontal branch , and the asymptotic giant branch phases .      on each model atmosphere ",
    "dwarfs , turnoff , giants ",
    "tb95 measure the absolute lick index value @xmath64 .",
    "doubling in turn the abundances @xmath65 of the dominant elements c , n , o , mg , fe , ca , na , si , cr , and ti , they determine the index changes @xmath66 .",
    "the abundance effects are therefore isolated at a given temperature and surface gravity . in this way , tb95 provide the first partial derivative @xmath67 $ ] of the index @xmath64 for the logarithmic element abundance increment @xmath68\\equiv\\log x_i^1/x_i^0=\\log 2=0.3\\ { \\rm dex}$ ] .",
    "information on the second partial derivatives is not provided by the tb95 calculations .    the most simple approach to express",

    "is this the case ?",
    "studies on the behaviour of the lick indices as functions of individual element abundances are only available from the work by tb95 .",
