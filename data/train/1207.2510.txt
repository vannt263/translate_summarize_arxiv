    "<S> the breaking of parallelograms can be shown by considering a thought experiment that consists of a simple physical configuration , similar to the experimental setup that is expected to lead to the measurement of gravitational waves with the use of laser interferometers . </S>",
    "<S> an incident beam of light splits into two beams running along perpendicular arms , endowed with fixed mirrors at the extremes . </S>",
    "<S> the reflected light beams are detected at the same point of the splitting . </S>",
    "<S> along each arm , the two light beams define two null vectors : the forward vector and the reflected vector . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the sum of these four vectors , the forward and reflected null vectors along the two arms , do form a parallelogram in flat space - time , but not in the presence of plane - fronted gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> the non - closure of the parallelogram is a manifestation of the torsion of the space - time , and in this context indicates the existence of gravitational waves .     </S>",
