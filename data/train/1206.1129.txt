    "in the cuprate bi@xmath0sr@xmath0cacu@xmath0o@xmath1 a correlation between oxygen dopant positions and local enhancements of the superconducting gap has been observed by stm measurements  @xcite .",
    "this correlation was explained at a phenomenological level by introducing a spatially modulated pairing strength which is enhanced at the impurity sites  @xcite .",
    "more generally , the idea of a spatially modulated pairing interaction caused by the combination of disorder and electronic correlations have been somewhat successful in explaining a series of experiments @xcite .",
    "the microscopic origin of the modulated pairing potential remains , however , unsettled despite several recent discussions @xcite .",
    "we have recently shown that such local enhancements of the pairing potential and hence the observed superconducting gap is a natural consequence of spin - fluctuation mediated pairing @xcite .",
    "for an overview of spin - fluctuation mediated pairing in cuprates and iron - pnictides we refer to refs . .",

    "we utilize the recently developed real - space formulation of the effective pairing interaction in real - space .",
    "similar to the situation of non - magnetic disorder @xcite , it is found that magnetic impurities may lead to significant local enhancements of the superconducting gap .",

    "local density variations occur close to the impurity site , and a small increased charge density is evident at the impurity site caused by a finite magnetization . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( e - h ) we show the induced magnetization , @xmath28 , as a function of lattice site .",

    "( [ eq : veff ] ) .",
    "interestingly , the effect of the impurity is not only to suppress the interaction at the impurity site .",
    "in fact , we see an enhancement of the pairing interaction at sites around the impurity . the enhancement effect is related to a re - distribution of spin densities which takes place in the presence of an impurity as reflected in the total density modulations and local magnetization @xcite .",

    "[ fig1](l ) .",
    "it is also known that non - magnetic impurities cause a local enhancement of the pairing interaction even though no local antiferromagnetism is induced in the normal phase of these systems @xcite .",
    "it therefore turns out that the enhancement effect is not dependent on induced antiferromagnetism and it is local variations of spin densities rather than a difference between spin densities that causes the effect . +     and the impurity strengths are in units of the nearest neighbor hopping constant @xmath18 : ( a ) @xmath19 , ( b ) @xmath20 , ( c ) @xmath21 and ( d ) : @xmath22 . for the results presented here",

    "( [ eq : veff ] ) and therefore the `` stoner enhancement '' of the superconducting gap is tuned by @xmath31 .",
    "thus , the coulomb interaction governs both the local gap enhancements and the development of antiferromagnetism , and the final superconducting gap results from a balance between them .",
    "we have shown that a local enhancement of the superconducting gap occurs in the vicinity of a magnetic impurity if the pairing interaction is mediated by spin - fluctuations .",
    "the real - space structure of the gap enhancement is robust to the impurity strength and resembles that of a point - like non - magnetic impurity .",
    "the effect arises due to local variations in the spin densities caused by the impurity . due to these variations ,",
