    "galaxy morphology in the local universe provides significant information about the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "massive galaxies in the nearby universe are well described by the hubble sequence , which correlates with the dominance of galaxy s central bulge , surface brightness and colors .",
    "hubble types are also broadly correlated with physical parameters , such as the star formation rate and dynamical properties @xcite . in the classical picture ,",
    "late - type spiral galaxies are active star  forming structures with flattened , gas rich , rotationally supported exponential disks , while early - type galaxies are more luminous , massive and quiescent systems , supported by stellar velocity dispersion and have smooth elliptical isophotes with a so  called  de vaucouleurs \" ( or similar ) light profile . in a color - magnitude ( or mass ) diagram of the local universe , the early- and late - type galaxies occupy two distinct regions , known as the red sequence and blue cloud , respectively ( blanton et al . 2003 , baldry et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the red sequence consists of mostly non - star - forming galaxies with a bulge dominated structure and colors indicative of an old stellar population .",
    "in contrast , the galaxies lying in the blue cloud have different star formation properties , including blue star - forming stellar populations and mostly disk - like structures .",
    "the key question of how and over what time  scale the hubble sequence has formed remains unanswered . at a basic level , exploring the origin of the hubble sequence can simply be done by investigating if high - redshift galaxies have distributions of morphological types ( early- and late - type ) and star - forming properties that resemble those in the nearby universe .",
    "several surveys that have used the hubble space telescope ( hst ) have observed that the properties of galaxies at @xmath10 are broadly consistent with those in the local universe ( bell et al .",
    "2004 : gems , papovich et al . 2005 : hdfn , cassata et al .",
    "2007 : cosmos ) .",
    "however , the morphological analysis is still controversial at the peak epoch of star - formation activity ( @xmath11 ) . until relatively recently",
    ", most studies of galaxy morphologies at @xmath12 have been performed at rest ",
    "frame ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths using optical imagers ( such as hst / wfpc2 and hst / acs ) .",
    "these works found that irregular or peculiar structures appear more common , and traditional hubble types do not appear to be present at these epochs @xcite .",
    "this is generally explained as due to the fact that uv radiation predominantly traces emission from the star - forming regions @xcite , which tend to be more clumped and irregularly distributed than older stellar populations , and also by the fact that quenched galaxies were missing from the optical images .",
    "the rest - frame optical regime is a better probe of the overall stellar distribution in galaxies , and early near  infrared ( nir ) observations with _",
    "hst _ and nicmos of star  forming galaxies at @xmath12 from uv selected samples found that their morphology remains generally compact and disturbed also at rest - frame optical wavelengths and bear no obvious morphological similarities to lower redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "interestingly , however , @xcite showed that 19 spectroscopically confirmed massive galaxies ( @xmath13 ) at @xmath14 are clearly separated into two classes as a blue cloud with large star - forming galaxies , and a red sequence with compact quiescent galaxies . unlike late  type galaxies , early - type galaxies ( etgs ) have been used to investigate the cosmic history of massive galaxies in many studies ( e.g. renzini ( 2006 ) , and references therein ) due to their simple elliptical morphologies and passively evolving stellar populations . at @xmath15 , there is general consensus that the majority of massive etgs ( @xmath16 ) were already in place at @xmath17 , with a number density comparable to that of local galaxies @xcite .",
    "a number of studies have reported the emergence of massive and compact galaxies by @xmath18 , which are already quenched etgs @xcite . the number density of these galaxies rapidly increases , by a factor of five , from @xmath8 to @xmath10 , and they are up to 5 times more compact in size than local ones with similar mass @xcite .",
    "recent works have suggested , however , that a large fraction of , and possibly even all , massive , quiscent galaxies at @xmath8 are disk dominated @xcite .",
    "while the observation of such disks at @xmath12 is based on morphological analysis alone , typically distribution of apparent elongation , with no dynamical measures at present , the existence a sizeable fraction of compact disks at @xmath12 among massive , passive galaxies @xcite suggests that the physical mechanism responsible for quenching star - formation may be distinct from the process responsible for morphological transformation .",
    "recently , studies of the morphologies of @xmath8 galaxies have advanced using the high resolution nir wide - field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) .",
    "@xcite found a variety of galaxy morphologies , ranging from large , blue , disk - like galaxies to compact , red , early - type galaxies at @xmath8 with 16 massive galaxies in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) .",
    "@xcite also studied the rest - frame uv and optical morphologies with @xmath19 galaxies determined by the yhvz color - color selection in the hudf and the early release science ( ers ) field , and confirmed previous studies by showing in particular the presence of regular disk galaxies , which have been missing in previous studies , either because they are not detected at the available sensitivity or because their appearance is irregular at rest - frame uv wavelengths .",
    "the results from these studies are generally interpreted as possible evidence at @xmath9 , at least among the brightest galaxies at that epoch , of the general correlations between spectral types and morphology that today define the hubble sequence",
    ". the most important limitations of these works are that they are based on very small samples , which are not statistically significant ( less than 20 galaxies ) and not homogeneously selected , and their morphological analysis was restricted to only @xmath2 profile fitting or visual classifications .",
    "significant improvements are now possible using larger samples of panchromatic images from the candels ( cosmic assembly near - infrared extragalactic legacy survey ) observations .",
    "@xcite investigated how the structure of galaxies ( @xmath2 index and size ) depends on galaxy position in the sfr ",
    "stellar mass diagrams since @xmath20 , specifically showing strong trends of specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) with @xmath2 index using large data sets combined in 4 different fields , cosmos , uds , goods - south and north .",
    "although the @xmath2 index , measured by fitting a single @xmath2 profile to a galaxy , is the most common approach to analyzing galaxy morphology , it is also useful to study morphologies with non - parametric measures such as gini ( @xmath3 ) @xcite , @xmath4 ( lotz et al .",
    "2004 ) , multiplicity ( @xmath7 ) ( law et al . 2007 ) and cas ( abraham et al . 1996 , conselice et al . 2003 ) since not all galaxies are described by smooth and symmetric profiles . in a recent candels paper , @xcite used gini ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 and visual classifications to identify a correlation between morphologies and star - formation status at @xmath8 , showing two distinct populations , bulge - dominated quiescent galaxies , and disky or irregular star - forming galaxies , though they only use massive galaxies ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "recent panchromatic surveys such as candels hold the promise of significant progress in investigating galaxy structures at high redshift because they combine sensitive _ hst _ morphology at rest - frame uv and optical wavelengths with the depth and accuracy of space  borne photometry .",
    "the candels project also adds coverage of a substantial amount of sky , which results in samples whose size and dynamic range in mass are about one order of magnitude , or more , larger than in previous works . in this study , we extend previous results using a statistically significant sample ( 1,671 galaxies ) down to a lower mass limit ( @xmath22 m@xmath23 at @xmath24 and @xmath25 m@xmath23 at @xmath26 , specifically for passive galaxies ) and using various morphological parameters ( non - parametric diagnostics such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath7 , concentration ( c ) and asymmetry ( a ) , and the parametric @xmath2 light profiles , characterized by the @xmath2 index ( n ) and half - light radius @xmath27 ) , as well as visual inspection .",
    "the combination of high  angular resolution and sensitivity afforded by the _ hst_/acs and wfc3 images with the relatively large size of the sample allows us to probe in a statistical fashion the correlations between galaxy structures and star - formation activity at @xmath8 , i.e. the epoch when the cosmic star ",
    "formation activity reached its peak , to their counterparts in the local universe .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows .",
    "the optical and infrared data and selection of our galaxy sample are introduced in section 2 .",
    "the rest - frame color and mass distributions are described in section 3 .",
    "we present the analysis of galaxy morphologies in the rest - frame optical using the distribution of non - parametric approaches , as well as @xmath2 index and half - light radius in section 4 .",
    "comparison with galaxies from the local universe is shown in section 5 and the results of a comparison of rest - frame uv morphologies with rest - frame optical are presented in section 6 .",
    "finally , we conclude with a discussion of our results and compare them to other studies in section 7 and summarize our results in section 8 .",
    "all the data used in this work come from the observations acquired during the goods ( giavalisco et al .",
    "2004 ) and candels ( grogin et al .  2012 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2012 ) projects in the goods  south field , including both space  born ( chandra , hubble and spitzer ) as well as ground  based ( vlt ) data .",
    "the candels _ hst _ observations , including the details of the data acquisition , reduction and calibration , source identification and photometry extraction , are thoroughly described elsewhere ( see grogin et al .",
    "2012 ; koekemoer et al .",
    "2012 ; guo et al .",
    "2013 ) ; here we briefly review key features of the wfc3 images that are relevant to this work .",
    "the _ hst _ component of candels consists of a multi - cycle treasury program to image five distinct fields ( goods - north and -south , egs , uds and cosmos ) using both wfc3 and acs .",
    "the whole project is organized as a two ",
    "tier deep+wide survey .",
    "the candels / deep survey covers about 125 square arc minutes to @xmath28-orbit depth within goods - north and -south @xcite at f105w(y ) , f125w(j ) and f160w(h ) , while the wide survey covers a total of @xmath29 square arc minutes to @xmath30-orbit depth within all five candels fields . in this study , we use the 4-epoch ( about 2 orbits ) candels f160w(h - band ) imaging that covers about 115 square arc minutes ( @xmath31 of the whole goods - s ) including the goods - s deep region , plus the ers @xcite .",
    "this survey has a @xmath32 limiting depth of @xmath33 , and a drizzled pixel scale of @xmath34 .",
    "a number of photometric catalogs exist based on candels data , and here we use one where sources have been detected using the package sextractor @xcite in the wfc3 h  band images , and multi  wavelength photometry has been obtained using a software package with an object template - fitting method ( tfit , laidler et al .",
    "this catalog includes photometry from the _",
    "hst_/ acs and wfc3 images in the bvizyjh bands ; from vlt / vimos u and vlt / isaac ks images ; and from the spitzer / irac images at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath35 m ( guo et al .  2013 ) .",
    "we identify galaxies at @xmath0 with a broad range of star ",
    "formation properties , from passive to star forming , and with different levels of dust obscuration using photometric redshifts and ssfr estimated by fitting the candels broad - band rest ",
    "frame uv / optical / nir spectral energy distribution ( sed ) to spectral population synthesis models ( hereafter , sed sample ) .",
    "additionally , for comparison , we also select samples of galaxies using the bzk technique , a color selection based on the ( b - z ) vs. ( z - k ) color - color diagram , widely used to identify galaxies at @xmath8 relatively independently of their star  formation activity and dust obscuration properties @xcite . while characterized by some contamination by agns and",
    "redshift interlopers , as well as incompleteness to very young and dust  free star  forming galaxies ( see @xcite ) , the bzk selection is overall quite effective and particularly economic in that it only requires the acquisition of three photometric bands .",
    "in contrast , the sed selection is observationally much more expensive because it requires a large number of photometric bands to yield robust photometric redshifts as well as robust measures of the stellar population properties , i.e. stellar mass , star ",
    "formation rate , dust obscuration and age of the dominant stellar population .",
    "for the same reason , however , it is less prone to the effects of photometric scatter and characterized by a higher degree of completeness than the bzk criterion .    in view of the fact that in candels the two goods fields have deeper and fully panchromatic images relative to the other fields of the survey , here we use the sed sample as our primary data set for our study , and compare it with the bzk sample to test if they yield similar conclusions about the general morphological properties of the galaxies mix at @xmath9 .",
    "such a comparison , which at this level of sensitivity can only be made in the goods fields , is particulary useful for those other fields where data for selecting galaxies by means of sed fitting are not available or do not have sufficient wavelength coverage and/or sensitivity for accurate results . in our particular case ,",
    "since the bzk sample is bsed on the ground  based k - band images , which are significantly shallower ( @xmath32 limiting magnitudes of ks=24.4 ) than the wfc3 images , the depth , and hence the size , of the sample is smaller than the sed one . however , since the efficiency and simplicity of the bzk selection criteria offer a distinct advantage in other fields of the candels survey , where the rich complement of photometry of the goods  south field is not available , the knowledge of the relative performance and possible limitations of both selection criteria will be very useful .",
    "measures of the stellar mass , star  formation rate , dust obscuration and age of the dominant stellar population have been obtained by guo et al .",
    "( 2013 ) using the tfit panchromatic catalog of the goods  south field ( see also guo et al .  2011 , 2012 , where key results and features of the sed fitting have been discussed ) .",
    "prior to carrying out the sed fitting , photometric redshifts have been measured for all galaxies from the 13band ubvizyjhksi@xmath36i@xmath37i@xmath38i@xmath39 photometry using the pegase 2.0 spectral library templates @xcite , as well as the available sample of 152 spectroscopic redshifts ( about 4% of our final sample ) as a training set . in the redshift range considered here",
    "the candels photometric redshifts are of good quality , as verified by comparing them against available spectroscopic ones .",
    "this comparison yields a mean and scatter ( @xmath40 deviation after @xmath41 clipping ) in our photometric redshift measurement of 0.0005 and 0.03 , respectively .",
    "the properties of the dominant stellar populations are subsequently derived by fitting the observed sed to the spectral population synthesis models by fixing the redshift to the photometrically derived value and using the redshift probability function , @xmath42 , to calculate the errors from a monte carlo bootstrap .",
    "the multi  band photometry is fit to the updated version of the @xcite spectral population synthesis library with a salpeter initial mass function .",
    "we use either a constant star formation history or an exponentially declining one ( @xmath43 ) , depending on which functions result in a smaller @xmath44 with the data .",
    "the calzetti law @xcite is used for the dust obscuration model together with the @xcite prescription for the opacity of inter galactic medium ( igm ) ( see guo et al .",
    "2013 for a full description of the procedure ) . in the redshift range @xmath45 , arbitrarily ( but inconsequentially )",
    "chosen to reproduce that of the bzk selection criteria ( see @xcite ) , the photo  z plus sed fitting procedures yield 3,542 galaxies with signal to noise ratio in the h - band @xmath46 ( hereafter , sed sample ) .",
    "star  forming and passive galaxies are defined based on the measure of the ssfr , namely the ratio of the star  formation rate to the stellar mass . specifically , we define passive galaxies as those with @xmath47 , and using this criterion we find 105 passive galaxies and 3,437 star  forming ones out of the 3,539 comprising the sed sample .",
    "thus , with our cut on the ssfr , 3% of all galaxies at @xmath9 are classified as passive .",
    "we have constructed the bzk sample by adopting the bzk color ",
    "color selection by @xcite , where galaxies of various  spectral types \" are identified by their position in the @xmath48 versus @xmath49 color - color diagram .",
    "the bzk selection is widely used to investigate the evolution of galaxies at @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "to the extent that the average obscuration properties of the star  forming galaxies are well described by the calzetti ( 2000 ) obscuration law , this rest uv / optical color selection is sensitive to galaxies at @xmath50 with a significantly broader range of dust obscuration than the uv selection alone ( e.g. reddy et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ; also guo et al .",
    "2011 for a discussion ) .",
    "it is also sensitive to passively evolving galaxies in a similar redshift range , which the uv selection misses altogether . as in any selection of distant galaxies that is based on colors , however , the details of the redshift distribution of the selected galaxies depend on the relative sensitivity of the images and the shape of the adopted bandpasses .",
    "the original bzk criteria were implemented using a sample where source detections were carried out in the k - band images , since these had sufficient sensitivity and were such that every galaxy detected at least in the z - band was detected in the k one with higher s / n . since this is not the case with our data , where the _",
    "hst_/acs z - band image is much deeper than the ground  based vlt / isaac ks band image even for the reddest sed considered here , we contruct our bzk samples from the acs z - band selected source catalog @xcite , where we further require @xmath51 in the k - band and @xmath52 in the z - band to ensure robust color measurements .",
    "we then use the selection criteria introduced by @xcite as shown in figure  [ fig : bzk ] : @xmath53    out of a total of 1,043 bzk galaxies , we find 981 sbzks ( blue circles in figure  [ fig : bzk ] ) and 62 pbzks ( red circles ) , namely 6% of the sample is made of passive galaxies .",
    "this fraction is twice as large as the one of the sed sample , and the reason is that the bzk selection defines galaxies as passive solely based on their colors , while in the sed sample galaxies are defined as passive based on the ssfr . if the threshold were defined as ssr@xmath54 gyr@xmath55 , then the sed sample and bzk would both have the same 6% fraction of passive galaxies . finally , it is important to keep in mind that all bzk galaxies also have detection in the wfc3/f160w candels images , which we have used to analyze their rest  frame optical morphology .    compared to the sed selection , the bzk selection is relatively easy and economical to implement , requiring only three photometric bands , and it is largely independent of dust reddening .",
    "the combination of photometric scatter ( which depends on the sensitivity of the data ) and the intrinsic variance of galaxies sed , however , result in some degree of contamination by interlopers ( i.e. galaxies that are not in the targeted redshift range ) as well as of incompleteness , namely loss of galaxies that are scattered away from the selection windows .",
    "for the same reasons , the separation between passive galaxies and star  forming ones suffers from scatter , in the sense that dust  reddened star ",
    "forming galaxies might be observed in the selection window of passive ones and vice versa ( see , e.g. daddi et al . 2004 , 2005 , 2007 ) .    to diminish the contamination by interlopers from outside the redshift range considered here and how it affects our morphological analysis",
    ", we can use the photometric redshift to restrict our sample to galaxies with @xmath56 .",
    "this further cut serves two purposes .",
    "first , it filters away the high  z tail of our bzk sample , which very likely results from the combination of the relatively shallow depth of the acs b ",
    "band images , and the fact that the sample is z  band selected .",
    "the cut also serves the purpose of creating our reference cosmic epoch to assess the state of galaxy morphology evolution .",
    "this leaves a final bzk sample of 736 galaxies down to @xmath57 , of which 46 are classified as passively evolving ( pbzk ) , i.e. 6.3% of the sample , and 690 are star  forming ( sbzk ) galaxies .",
    "we explicitly note that using the photometric redshifts to eliminate likely interlopers has left the passive fraction essenctially unchanged . in the following",
    "we will refer to this photo  z filtered sample simply as the `` bzk sample '' , while the original sample will be called the `` pure bzk '' one .",
    "the top panel of the figure  [ fig : numcount ] compares the photometric redshift distribution of the bzk sample to that of the whole h ",
    "band selected tfit sample ( e.g. sed sample not restricted by redshift ) , while the bottom one shows the number counts of the sed sample , of the two bzk samples , and also of the whole h  band selected tfit sample for comparison .",
    "it can be seen from the photometric redshift histograms that the redshift distribution of bzks is tapered at both ends of the corresponding selection window as a result of the color cuts built in the selection criteria .",
    "clearly , this is not presented in the sed sample .",
    "it can also be seen that the number counts of the sed and bzk samples are very similar in shape , especially at @xmath58 , the former being slightly larger than the latter simply due to the larger completeness and the fact that the redshift distribution is not set by color cuts .",
    "since the magnitude ( mass ) distribution is not similar especially at the faint end , we cut bzk and sed samples with @xmath59 ( @xmath60 : over the 90% completeness limit of the candels @xmath61 band in the goods - s deep field ) to study and compare the morphologies directly . as we shall see later , the morphological properties of the sed and bzk samples are essentially identical , suggesting they are both representative of the mix of bright galaxies at @xmath9 .",
    "in figure  [ fig : cm ] , we report the distribution of rest - frame u  v ( 3730 6030 ) color versus stellar mass for the bzk ( left ) and sed ( right ) samples .",
    "the blue crosses and red circles represent the star - forming ( sbzk ) and passive ( pbzk ) galaxies , respectively .",
    "the rest - frame colors are measured using the best - fitting sed template , which is scaled to pass through the closest observed photometric point for each rest - frame wavelength we consider to derive the k - correction and subsequently the rest - frame magnitude .",
    "figure  [ fig : cm ] shows that there is a distinct difference in the color - mass diagram between star - forming and passive galaxies . in both our samples ,",
    "the colors of passive galaxies ( pbzks ) span a much smaller range than those of star - forming ones ( sbzks ) .",
    "an important question to answer , therefore , is whether or not the limited excursion of the intrinsic colors of the pbzks is simply the result of their selection and not due to the characteristics of their sed .",
    "after all , these galaxies are selected specifically to be red , namely to have the observed colors expected from passively evolving galaxies ( or galaxies with a relatively small specific star formation rate ) observed at @xmath62 . to test this possibility ,",
    "we have compared the scatter of the observed colors and of the intrinsic colors of our pbzk sample in bins of both apparent and absolute magnitude , which is shown in figure  [ fig : p_sigma ] . as it can be seen , the scatter _",
    "always _ increases when going from the intrinsic colors to the observed ones , as one would expect in a sample with a relatively large dispersion of redshift .",
    "moreover , the pbzks occupy a significantly smaller range of stellar mass , and , at the same time , the two types occupy a disjoint range of ssfr ( color - coding of points at figure  [ fig : cm ] ) . taken all together , this is evidence that while pbzks are selected to be red , thus covering a restricted range of both the _ observed _ b - z and z - k colors , their _ intrinsic _ colors are all very similar , since they span a range significantly smaller than the observed ones , denoting a similarity of physical properties .",
    "this conclusion is further reinforced by their small range of mass , since the color selection does not in principle set any restrictions on the stellar mass .",
    "we note that although our star - forming and passive samples seperate well in figure  [ fig : cm ] .",
    "a small fraction of massive star - forming galaxies overlap with the passive ones .",
    "the majority of those massive star - forming galaxies are red due to uv colors which are reddened by dust , and similar trends are observed in the red sequence at @xmath63 @xcite . in the bzk sample , 11 red sbzks with @xmath64 are all massive ( @xmath65 ) and generally red ( rest - frame @xmath66 except two galaxies with @xmath67 ) .",
    "they are visually characterized by compact structures , with the exception of one having large size ( @xmath68 kpc ) and a light profile characteristic of an exponential disk ( @xmath69 )",
    ". these could be passive galaxies that are not classified as such by the bzk criterion either because of photometric scatter in the photometric measures or because of the galaxies intrinsic sed variations ( see section 2.2 ) .",
    "we find 70 ( 50 for the bzk sample ) x - ray detected galaxies among our sample , marked as diamond symbols in figure  [ fig : cm ] .",
    "most of them ( @xmath70 : sed sample , @xmath71 : bzk sample ) are star - forming galaxies ( sbzks ) , and those x - ray detected galaxies are generally massive and compact .",
    "we do not exclude them from further study since they also follow a similar trend in the color - mass diagram , and have similar morphologies as non x - ray detected galaxies .",
    "in order to investigate further the morphologies of galaxies within @xmath72 , we turn next to several non - parametric morphological diagnostics such as the gini parameter ( @xmath3 ) , the second - order moment of the brightest 20% of the galaxy pixels ( @xmath4 ) and the multiplicity parameter ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "many studies have used these parameters to quantify galaxy morphology @xcite locally and at high redshift , generally showing that they are an effective and automated way to measure galaxy morphologies for large samples .",
    "these parameters quantify the spatial distribution of galaxy flux among the pixels , without assuming a particular analytic function for the galaxy s light distribution .",
    "thus they may be a better characterization of the morhology of irregulars , as well as standard hubble - type galaxies ( lotz et al .",
    "2004 , hereafter , lpm04 ) . before measuring these parameters",
    ", we need to identify the pixels belonging to each galaxy . for each galaxy , we calculate the `` elliptical petrosian radius '' , @xmath73 , which is defined like the petrosian radius @xcite but uses ellipses instead of circles ( lpm04 ) .",
    "we use the segmentation map generated by sextractor when making the h - band detections @xcite , and use the ellipticities and position of peak flux determined by sextractor for each galaxy .",
    "we then set the semi - major axis @xmath73 to the value where the ratio of the surface brightness at @xmath73 to the mean surface brightness within @xmath73 is equal to 0.2 .",
    "the surface brightness at each elliptical aperture , @xmath74 , is measured as the mean surface brightness within an elliptical annulus from @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",
    "there are 10 galaxies in the sed sample and one sbzk whose images comprise less than 28 pixels ( corresponding to a circle with a radius of 3 pixels ) , which we have excluded from further analysis . note again that we use galaxies with @xmath77 from both samples for our morphology analysis , which leaves us with 46 pbzks and 669 sbzks , and 104 passive and 1567 star - forming galaxies of the sed sample .    using the sed and bzk samples with stellar mass @xmath78 , we first compute the g parameter defined in lpm04 , which measures the cumulative distribution function of a galaxy s pixel values ( light ) . therefore ,",
    "g of 1 would mean all light is in one pixel while g of 0 would mean every pixel has an equal share .",
    "hence , g is used to distinguish between the galaxies for which fluxes are concentrated within a small region or uniformly diffuse .",
    "we also compute the @xmath4 parameter , which traces the spatial distribution of any bright nuclei , bars , spiral arms , and off ",
    "center star clusters .",
    "typically , galaxies with high values ( @xmath79 ) are extended objects with double or multiple nuclei , whereas low values ( @xmath80 ) are relatively smooth with a bright nucleus ( see lmp04 for a detailed explanation of @xmath4 ) .",
    "the third non - parametric coefficient is the multiplicity @xmath7 @xcite , designed to discriminate between sources based on how \" multiple  the source appears .",
    "galaxies with lower @xmath7 are compact galaxies with generally one nuclei while irregular galaxies with multiple clumps have higher @xmath7 @xcite ( the definitions of each diagnostic are presented in the above references ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : nonpar ] shows the relative distribution of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 for star  forming and passive galaxies of the bzk and sed samples ( blue and red histogram , respectively ) .",
    "the @xmath3 values are mostly in the range @xmath81 with a mean of 0.43 for star - forming galaxies ( 0.48 for sbzks ) and 0.53 for passive ones ( 0.58 for pbzks ) .",
    "passive galaxies are shifted to higher @xmath3 than star - forming ones .",
    "the majority of pbzks ( 90% ) and about 70% of passive galaxies have @xmath82 .",
    "the mean values of the @xmath4 for star - forming ( sbzk ) and passive ( pbzk ) galaxies are -1.47 ( -1.54 ) and -1.68 ( -1.73 ) , respectively .",

    "while the modicus of spectroscopic observations currently available @xcite is certainly consistent with the high  redshift passive galaxies being spheoroids , a significant or even dominant contribution by rotation can not be ruled out given the limited angular resolution of the existing spectra , and some have indeed proposed that a significant fraction or maybe even most @xcite of these galaxies are actually compact rotating disks . from the theory point of view , there are three distict scenarios for the formation of the compact spheroids , namely major mergers , multiple minor mergers or the migration of clumps driven by violent disk instabilities @xcite to the disks center , building a massive bulge .",
    "cosmological hydrodynamical simulations indicate that these processes , operating alone or in combination , can form compact spheroids . in most cases , the inner parts of the compact spheroids formed by vdi are rotating , and the outer parts are non - rotating , formed mostly by minor mergers .",

    "these roughly classified passive disks have mostly @xmath156 ,  @xmath157 , suggesting that they generally are not clumpy structures , and their morphology is characterized by a central bright nucleus surrounded by low surface brightness features .",
    "the presence of passive disks seems inconsistent with models where galaxy morphology transforms from a disk structure into a bulge followed by quenching of star formation as the galaxy evolves .",
    "the existence of passive disks is , however , predicted by hydrodynamic simulations @xcite , which show that these structures form when cold gas inflows are halted , thus quenching star formation without the transformation of morphology .",
    "for example , @xcite argue that the morphological properties and volume density of massive , compact passive galaxies at @xmath9 and those of compact star  forming galaxies at @xmath158 are generally consistent with such a scenario .      in this study , to the extent that passive and star  forming galaxies can effectively be identified by means of broad  band colors , e.g. either the bzk selection criteria or via sed fitting , we have shown that passive ( pbzk ) and star - forming ( sbzk ) galaxies occupy regions of the rest - frame u - v and stellar mass diagram ( e.g. figure  [ fig : cm ] ) that are essentially the same as the `` red sequence '' and `` blue cloud '' observed in the local universe ( e.g. blanton et al .  2003 ,",
    "bell et al .  2004 ) .",
    "passive galaxies ( pbzks ) are intrinsically red and massive , whereas , star - forming galaxies ( sbzks ) are generally bluer and have lower mass than passive ( pbzk ) ones ( with the exception of about 7% red massive sbzks ) .",
    "the majority of the exceptions are massive dusty star - forming galaxies , and are largely redder than low mass star - forming galaxies ( sbzks ) at @xmath8 .",
    "thus , they can contaminate the red sequence sample by a significant fraction , if selected based only on a single rest - frame ( u - v ) color @xcite , since most of the uv emission from high - redshift star formation is at least somewhat obscured by dust .",
    "an intriguing property of this color - mass diagram is the lack of passive galaxies with mass @xmath159 m@xmath23 . to a minor extent , this is the result of incompleteness , since passive galaxies with lower mass , and hence luminosity , become harder to detect .",
    "from the simulation using model galaxies in the goods - s deep field mosaics , we confirm that the early - type galaxies with  de vaucouleurs \" light profile ( @xmath2 index = 4 ) are 90% complete with @xmath160 .",
    "clearly , however , such a small incompleteness alone can not explain the lack of low ",
    "mass passive galaxies at @xmath9 , and in fact such low  mass galaxies are actually detected by the sed selection , as shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : cm ] which illustrates how massive red galaxies are rarely star - forming , and more actively star - forming galaxies are bluer and have lower masses .",
    "furthermore , obscured star  forming galaxies in the same redshift range and with similar rest ",
    "frame ( u - v ) colors are detected in significantly larger number even at lower masses , as the right panel of the figure shows .",
    "this fact strongly suggests that the quenching of star - formation at this epoch is tightly correlated with the mass of the galaxies , with the most massive ones being significantly more likely to cease their star formation activity . at mass",
    "@xmath161 m@xmath23 , galaxies appear much less likely to stop forming stars , a fact that has been observed by other groups .",
    "for example , kauffmann et al.(2003 ) and bell et al.(2007 ) observed that at @xmath15 the stellar mass value of about @xmath162 appears to be the transition mass point between galaxies that belong to the blue cloud ( younger stellar populations ) and those of the red sequence .",
    "there is evidence that this transition mass between quenched and star - forming galaxies has evolved significantly over cosmic time @xcite further supporting the downsizing scenario whereby more massive galaxies appear to quench first , and subsequently lower mass galaxies quench later . at high redshift , quenching appears to depend on galaxy stellar mass , perhaps through some internal process that is tied to the total mass of the galaxy of which the stellar one is a good proxy in passive systems , whereas later , environmental processes can contribute to galaxy quenching and can affect lower - mass galaxies ( e.g. peng et al 2010 , peng et al 2012 ) .",
    "this process effectively builds up the lower - mass end of the red sequence over time by quenching lower - mass star - forming galaxies later when environmental processes become more influential .",
    "our observed deficiency of lower - mass passive galaxies at @xmath8 is consistent with this scenario and the implied mechanisms by which galaxies quench their star - formation .",
    "results from other deep extragalactic surveys have provided constraints on the buildup of stellar mass locked up in the red sequence , by studying how the bimodality of galaxy properties has changed over cosmic time .",
    "for example , using the combo-17 and deep2 surveys , @xcite have studied the evolution in the rest - frame color bimodality of galaxy samples out to @xmath10 , finding evidence that the buildup of the red sequence must be accounted for by a combination of merging of galaxies already on the red sequence , as well as migration of star - forming galaxies that have quenched . recently",
    ", brammer et al ( 2011 ) extended the study of rest - frame color bimodality in galaxies to higher redshift , showing that star - forming and passive galaxies are still robustly separated in color over the redshift range @xmath163 , and coming to the similar conclusion that the growth of the red sequence must come from both merging and migration , particularly for galaxies above the apparent quenching threshold , @xmath164 . in this context , a possibility is that that the morphological bimodality we have observed in this study may imply that some degree of morphological transformation must accompany the quenching of star - forming galaxies at @xmath165 , if they are to match the properties of the red sequence after quenching . regardless of the dominant mechanisms building the red sequence , and weather or not the dominant mechanisms evolve with redshift , our result suggests that the process was already underway at redshift 2 .",
    "in other words , at this epoch , the formation of the hubble sequence is already underway .",
    "further detailed study of the evolution of morphological properties of galaxies as a function of mass and star - formation properties will be required to identify the specific mechanisms contributing to the growth of the red sequence .",
    "we mainly use the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 to study the morphologies of galaxies at @xmath8 .",
    "those non - parametric measures are widely used to study galaxy morphologies at high redshift , especially for large samples @xcite .",
    "we investigate the robustness of the @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 parameters in relation to the snr in appendix a and show that any differences in the estimated parameters for the same galaxies observed in the goods - s and udf images , whose only difference is the vastly different total exposure time , are relatively small .",
    "most of the galaxies in our samples ( above @xmath71 of bzk and @xmath122 of sed selected galaxies ) have reliable morphological measurements with @xmath106 at @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , the good correspondence between those parameters and visual inspection ( in figure  [ fig : mont ] ) , as well as model - dependent parameters indicates that our @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 measures are not biased by low signal - to - noise .",
    "we note that @xmath2 index alone is generally not sufficient to quantify the morphology of low mass galaxies since we find no correlation between @xmath2 index and non - parametric measures in the lower mass systems ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "also non - parametric measures more effectively characterize the morphology of irregular galaxies ( lpm04 ) .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to use non- parametric diagnostics instead of , or at least in parallel with , the commonly used @xmath2 profile to study the morphology of lower mass galaxies and to explore the origin of the hubble sequence at @xmath8 , and epoch when many galaxies appear irregular .      both the bzk and sed samples show very similar morphological distributions in all the analysis done here .",
    "the comparison of the two samples confirms that they are similarly representative of the mix of bright galaxies at @xmath8 .",
    "we additionally compare the distribution of morphological parameters for the 136 spectroscopically confirmed bzk galaxies ( 8 pbzks and 128 sbzks , specz sample ) to the parent distribution ( bzk sample ) .",
    "as expected , the relative distributions of @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 are similar to our parent sample , and the median values of each parameter are almost the same , with the exception of @xmath3 in the case of sbzks . the average @xmath3 value of bzks in the specz sample is slightly higher , since over @xmath122 of the specz sample are bright and massive ( @xmath167 ) galaxies , which tend to have higher @xmath3 .",
    "thus , in conclusion , the very similar results derived from both samples proves the effectiveness of the bzk selection criteria in sampling the full diversity of the mix of massive galaxies at @xmath9 , at least as far as the morphological properties of relatively massive galaxies are considered .",
    "the bzk selection will be particularly effective , for example , in the other three candels fields where the broad  band photometry is neither as deep or as broad in wavlength as in the two goods fields .",
    "in this paper we have explored general trends between galaxy morphology and broad  band spectral types at @xmath8 using the _ hst_/wfc3 h  band images taken in the goods  south field as part of the candels survey , in combination with the existing goods acs z - band images , as well as sensitivity  matched images at other wavelngths that are part of the goods data products @xcite . combining the deep and high - resolution nir data to optical data , we are able to study the dependence of morphologies on wavelengths and expand the scope of previous studies of galaxy morphologies at the same redshift @xcite with significantly larger sample size and lower mass limit ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "the galaxies of our primary sample are selected in the redshift range @xmath131 to cover a broad range of spectral types ( star  formation properties and dust obscuration ) using sed fitting to spectral population synthesis models ( sed sample ) . for comparative reasons we also selected galaxies using the bzk creterion which culled galaxies in the same redshift range and with essentailly identical spectral properties , modulo a large contamination from interlopers and agn .",
    "analyses of the two samples show consistent results suggesting that the bzk and sed selection criteria are equivalent in sampling the mix of spectral types at @xmath9 .",
    "we investigate the rest - frame optical morphologies using five non - parametric approaches , mainly @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath7 in addition to @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and two model - dependent parameters obtained by fitting @xmath2 profiles , namely @xmath119 and @xmath27 .",
    "the major findings of this study are presented below .    1 .   in the rest - frame ( u - v )",
    "color and mass diagram , our sample clearly separates into red massive passive galaxies with low ssfr and blue star - forming ones with less massive , high ssfr occupying the same regions in the color - mass diagram as the galaxies observed in the local universe .",
    "we find that galaxies with different spectral types are distinctly classified morphologically as two populations , especially for massive systems ( @xmath168 ) : 1 ) star - forming galaxies are heterogeneous , with mixed features including bulges , disks , and irregular ( or clumpy ) structures , with relatively low @xmath3 , @xmath119 and high @xmath4 , @xmath7 ; 2 ) passive galaxies are spheroidal - like compact structures with higher @xmath3 , @xmath119 and lower @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "generally , the sizes of star - forming galaxies are larger than passive ones , even in massive systems , but some have very compact morphologies , with @xmath169 . we confirm using a variety of measures that star formation activity is correlated with morphology at @xmath8 , with the passive galaxies looking similar to local passive ones although smaller , while star - forming galaxies show considerably more mophological diversity than massive star - forming galaxies on the hubble sequence today .",
    "we show that the morphological analysis only using the @xmath2 index is not sufficient to charaterize differences in morphologies especially for lower mass galaxies ( @xmath170 ) .",
    "therefore we conclude that it is important to use non - parametric measures to investigate the morphologies of high redshift galaxies in a broad range of stellar masses . in this study ,",
    "the combination of large samples with a suite of morphological diagnaostics , both parametric and non  parametric ones , as well as visual inspections , gives us a significantly improved description of the state of galaxy morphologies at @xmath8 and its correlations with the spectral type , i.e. mostly the star ",
    "formation activity , expanding the significance and the scope of previous studies which were based on much smaller samples and only massive galaxies at the same epoch @xcite .",
    "4 .   generally , @xmath8 galaxies show a similar trend in morphologies with those measured from the redshifted images of local galaxies , even though many of the star - forming galaxies have @xmath4 values higher than seen for galaxies in the local sample .",
    "the passive galaxies at @xmath8 have @xmath3 and @xmath4 values that are much more similar to those observed for the present  day e / s0 galaxies .",
    "comparison of visual images between the rest - frame optical and near uv show that the morphological k - correction is generally weak , however , the comparison with non - parametric measures indicates that galaxies observed in the rest - frame uv are slightly clumpier , with lower @xmath3 and higher @xmath4 and @xmath7 , than rest - frame optical .",
    "taken all together , our results show that the correlations between morphology as traced by a suite of common diagnostics , and broad  band uv / optical spectral types of the mix of relatively massive galaxies ( i.e. @xmath171 m@xmath23 ) at @xmath9 are quantitatively and qualitatively similar to those observed for their counterparts in the local universe .",
    "we interpret these results as evidence that the backbone of the hubble sequence observed today was already in place at @xmath9 .",
    "this work is based on observations taken by the candels multi - cycle treasury program with the nasa / esa hst , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , inc .",
    ", under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
    "the reliability of model - independent parameters has been tested and discussed by many previous studies @xcite .",
    "these parameters are robust for large bright sources ( with high signal - to - noise ratio ) in general , but it can be unreliable for small faint sources . in particular , the @xmath3 value is very sensitive to the signal - to - noise ratio ( lpm04 and lisker et al .",
    "our galaxy sample goes deeper ( @xmath172 ) , and to lower stellar mass limits ( @xmath173 ) than other works that study morphologies at @xmath8 ( e.g. kriek et al .",
    "2009 , szomoru et al .",
    "2011 , wang et al .",
    "therefore , it is crucial to understand how noise and other limitations affect parameters we use here .",
    "we test the dependence of the parameters , @xmath145 and @xmath7 , on the signal - to - noise ratio , i.e. , the depth of an image .",
    "hst / udf wfc3 imaging    data , which differ only in exposure time from goods - s data , is an ideal comparison dataset for investigating the effect of the different image depth on these parameters .",
    "previously , lisker et al .",
    "2008 tested the dependence of signal - to - noise on @xmath145 in the udf and goods - s using @xmath174-band images . to investigate how this affects our measurements with the nir wfc3 images",
    ", we use the udf and shallower goods - s f160w ( h - band ) data ( both with 60mas pixel scales ) and select 959 sources in the udf image using goods - s source catalog .",
    "then , we estimate @xmath73 from the goods - s h - band image , and use it to measure the parameters for both the udf and goods - s images .",
    "the final sample is 520 objects which have stellarity @xmath175 , after excluding sources for which the number of pixels within @xmath73 is less than 28 pixels ( same exclusion with lisker 2008 ) .",
    "signal - to - noise ratio per pixel ( @xmath90 ) is defined as @xmath176 where , @xmath177 indicates the total number of pixels within the @xmath73 , @xmath178 is the total image exposure time .",
    "@xmath179 and @xmath180 are the pixel values in the drizzled image and rms image , respectively .",
    "the strong dependence of @xmath181 on the @xmath90 are shown in figures  [ fig : gini_sn ] , [ fig : m20_sn ] , and [ fig : psi_sn ] , respectively .",
    "the two top panels in figure  [ fig : gini_sn ] present how values of @xmath3 vary with @xmath90 in the goods - s ( red circles ) and udf ( blue circles ) .",
    "obviously , the udf has a higher @xmath90 ( difference of depth is about 1.8 mag ) , but the overall trend of @xmath3 looks similar to that for goods - s .",
    "both @xmath3 values overlap almost exactly when we move the gini of the udf to the relatively small median difference ( -0.03 ) shown in the bottom left panel .",
    "however , the @xmath3 of galaxies with different exposure times is dependent on the @xmath90 as shown in the bottom right panel .",
    "the difference of in @xmath3 between the udf and goods - s decrease as @xmath90 increases . @xmath4 and",
    "@xmath7 also follows the same trend and distribution as @xmath3 as shown in figure  [ fig : m20_sn ] and [ fig : psi_sn ] , but with small median differences of about 0.01 and 0.11 , respectively .",
    "consequently , the model - independent parameters depend on signal - to - noise ratio , but the difference between two fields with different exposure times are less significant than @xcite .",
    "lpm04 find that @xmath3 and @xmath4 are reliable for galaxy images with @xmath182 ( vertical dashed line on the bottom right panel in each figure ) .",
    "given this threshold in reliability , we investigate how this may affect our results by measuring the @xmath90 of each galaxy .",
    "we find over 90% of bzk sample and 70% of sed sample having @xmath183 , which excludes some faint star - forming galaxies and passive galaxies with low @xmath3 from our sample .",
    "repeating our analysis with these faint objects removed does nt change the results .",
    "therefore , we confirm that the results from our measurements did not suffer from this @xmath184 effect .",

    "<S> we discuss the state of the assembly of the hubble sequence in the mix of bright galaxies at redshift @xmath0 with a large sample of 1,671 galaxies down to @xmath1 , selected from the hst / acs and wfc3 images of the goods  south field obtained as part of the goods and candels observations . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the relationship between the star formation properties and morphology using various parametric diagnostics , such as the @xmath2 light profile , gini ( @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 , concentration ( @xmath5 ) , asymmetry ( @xmath6 ) and multiplicity ( @xmath7 ) parameters . </S>",
    "<S> our sample clearly separates into massive , red and passive galaxies versus less massive , blue and star forming ones , and this dichotomy correlates very well with the galaxies morphological properties . star  </S>",
    "<S> forming galaxies show a broad variety of morphological features , including clumpy structures and bulges mixed with faint low surface brightness features , generally characterized by disky - type light profiles . </S>",
    "<S> passively evolving galaxies , on the other hand , very often have compact light distribution and morphology typical of today s spheroidal systems . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that artificially redshifted local galaxies have a similar distribution with @xmath8 galaxies in a @xmath3@xmath4 plane . </S>",
    "<S> visual inspection between the rest - frame optical and uv images show that there is a generally weak morphological k - correction for galaxies at @xmath8 , but the comparison with non - parametric measures show that galaxies in the rest - frame uv are somewhat clumpier than rest - frame optical . </S>",
    "<S> similar general trends are observed in the local universe among massive galaxies , suggesting that the backbone of the hubble sequence was already in place at @xmath9 . </S>"
