    "conventional phenomenological quark models widely used for describing low - energy properties of baryons treat nucleon as consisting of only up and down quarks ; intrinsically , there is no strange quark in the nucleon . considering the success of the constituent quark models @xcite , it may come as a surprise when some recent measurements and theoretical analyses indicate a possible existence of a significant strange quark content in the nucleon .    for example , analyses of the sigma term @xcite in pion - nucleon scattering suggest that about one third of the rest mass of the proton comes from @xmath2 pairs inside the proton .",
    "the emc measurement of the proton spin structure functions in deep - inelastic muon scattering @xcite has been interpreted as an indication of the strange quark sea @xmath2 strongly polarized opposite to the nucleon spin , leading to the conclusion that the total quark spin contributes little to the total spin of the proton .",
    "a similar conclusion has been drawn from the bnl elastic neutrino - proton scattering @xcite .",
    "this has stimulated a set of new experimental proposals @xcite to measure the neutral weak form factors of the nucleon which might be sensitive to the strange quarks of the nucleon .",
    "one of the intriguing idea associated with a direct probe of the strangeness content of proton is to use @xmath3 meson production from proton @xcite .",
    "since @xmath3 meson is nearly 100% @xmath4-state because of the @xmath5-@xmath3 ideal mixing , its coupling to the proton is suppressed by the ozi rule .",
    "the main idea of this proposal , called ozi `` evasion '' process , is to determine the amount of the @xmath4-admixture of nucleon , if any , by isolating its contribution in @xmath3 production processes .",
    "for example , @xmath4 admixture in the proton wavefunction allows contributions from `` shakeout '' and `` rearrangement '' diagrams in @xmath3 production from @xmath6 and @xmath7 collisions @xcite .",
    "another idea is to use @xmath3-meson lepto- and electroproduction from proton target as advocated by henley _",
    "_ @xcite . in this case , in addition to the diffractive production mechanism of the vector - meson  dominance model ( vdm ) we have contributions from the direct `` knockout '' mechanism .",
    "if we consider @xmath4 admixture of proton , we can parameterize the fock - space decomposition of the proton wavefunction as @xmath8 where @xmath9 denotes any combination of gluons and light quark pairs of @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks",
    ". analyses of the @xmath3 production experiments can give estimates on @xmath12 .",
    "for instance , investigation of @xmath6 annihilation by connected quark line diagrams estimates that the @xmath4 sea quark contribution to the proton wavefunction is between 1% and 19% @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , by using the @xmath3 electroproduction its upper bound is estimated to be about 10 - 20% . to obtain this estimation , the authors used nonrelativistic quark model ( nrqm ) and calculated the cross section of the @xmath4-knockout process .",
    "because of the paucity of experimental data @xcite , it was compared with the vdm predictions",
    ". however , as was pointed out by our previous publication @xcite where a preliminary result was reported , the knockout contributions are closely related to the hadron form factors and in the considered kinematical region of @xmath3 production , the minimum value of @xmath13 is about 3.6 gev@xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the three - momentum transferred to the hadron system .",
    "so it is clear that the value of the momentum transfer in this process is too large to use the nrqm because its predictions on hadron form factors are in poor agreement with experiment at @xmath16 gev@xmath14 .    in this paper",
    ", we improve the work of ref .",
    "@xcite by including relativistic effects based on the relativistic harmonic oscillator model ( rhom ) @xcite which describes successfully the proton form factors in a wide range of @xmath13 .",

    "@xcite as well as for the @xmath4-knockout .",
    "the calculations are done both in nrqm and in rhom for a comparison . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we will compare the cross sections of the knockout processes with the vdm predictions .",
