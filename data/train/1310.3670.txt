    "<S> despite being a simple textbook model ( a driven tight binding model ) , we find a rather rich behavior out of equilibrium . in the thermodynamic limit the large deviation function exhibits nonanalyticity , signaling a phase - transition - like behavior , reflected for instance in a discontinuity of the current distribution function . </S>",
