    "for star - forming galaxies ( sfgs ) , a tight correlation is found between stellar mass ( @xmath6 ) and star formation rate ( sfr ) , which is commonly referred to the star formation main sequence ( ms ) @xcite .",
    "the ms can be described by a single pow - law formulated by log@xmath9@xmath10@xmath11@xmath12 , where @xmath13 is between 0.6 and 1.0 @xcite .",
    "recently , the form of the ms is found to be better fitted by two power - laws . below a transition mass of @xmath14 , the ms has a steep slope of @xmath15 . above the transition mass ,",
    "the slope becomes flattened , with @xmath16 $ ] , depending on redshift @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the physical mechanisms that drive the curvature of the ms at @xmath14 are still unclear .    among the proposed mechanisms responsible for the curvature of the ms , galaxy bulge growth",
    "is most favored @xcite .",
    "observationally , more massive galaxies are indeed more bulgy and tend to have higher bulge - to - total mass ratio ( b / t ) .",
    "as shown in previous works , the central bulges of massive galaxies are generally old and dead @xcite . given that the bulge component contributes little to the total sfr of a galaxy , the specific star formation rate ( ssfr , termed as ssfr = sfr/@xmath6 ) of a high b / t galaxy should be lower than that of a disk dominated galaxy , even they have the same @xmath6 .",
    "this idea is supported by the work of @xcite , who found that when accounting for disk / bulge decomposition , the disk mass normalized sfr ( @xmath18 , formulated by @xmath18=sfr/@xmath19 , where @xmath19 is the stellar mass of disk component ) shows a weak dependence on @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite argues that the star formation in galaxies is mainly contributed from galactic disk components .",
    "however , the details of how bulges affect the star formation activities in galaxies remain to be explored . to better understand the role of bulges in shaping the ms relation , in this letter , we use the @xmath20 @xcite and sdss @xcite data to investigate the recent star formation in the central and outer regions of a large local sfgs sample . throughout this letter",
    ", we assume a concordance @xmath21cdm cosmology with @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 @xmath25 mpc@xmath26 , and a @xcite imf .",
    "to assess the role of bulges in shaping the ms , a straightforward way is to derive the ssfr of the bulge component ( @xmath27 ) . since the direct measure of @xmath27 is quite difficult , in this work we use the nuv@xmath28 color as a @xmath27 indicator .",
    "the nuv@xmath0 is more tightly correlated with ssfr than the @xmath29 color , especially at the low ssfr end @xcite .",
    "this is not surprised because the uv luminosity @xmath30 is an sfr indicator ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and nuv@xmath0 is thus a proxy of sfr/@xmath31 , where @xmath31 is the @xmath32-band luminosity .",
    "thus the nuv@xmath0 actually tells one the luminosity weighted ssfr .",
    "traditionally , a bulge+disk decomposition is required if one wants to derive the nuv@xmath28 .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath33 imaging has a relatively low resolution ( the _ galex _ nuv image has a resolution of 1 pixel=15 and a point spread function ( psf ) with full width at half - maximum ( fwhm)=53 ) .",
    "therefore a reliable bulge+disk decomposition procedure can be done only for galaxies with large angular sizes , which will yield a very small sample size . to investigate a large sample , in this work we instead measure the nuv@xmath0 color of the central region of a galaxy ( nuv@xmath34 ) as the representative of nuv@xmath28 of the galaxy .",
    "we refer the central region to be @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the radius enclosing 50% of the sdss @xmath32-band petrosian flux . by doing this",
    ", one can simply perform aperture photometry to obtain nuv@xmath34 for a galaxy sample with similar angular sizes .",
    "following @xcite , we have constructed a uv - optical matched photometric catalog .",
    "this catalog contains about 220,000 galaxies with uniform photometric measurements on the resolution and psf - matched _ _",
    "galex__+sdss images , which are cross - matched between the sdss dr8 @xcite spectroscopic galaxies and the _ galex _ gr6 database . for each galaxy",
    ", the fluxes were measured using 5 different apertures , with @xmath37[1.5 , 3.0 , 6.0 , 9.0 , 12.0 ] , in the fuv , nuv , @xmath38 bands .",
    "we also measure the total magnitude of the galaxies with sextractor @xcite .",
    "all the magnitudes have been corrected for galactic extinction using the galactic dust map @xcite .",
    "the details of data reduction procedure can be found in @xcite and @xcite .        to ensure that the measured central nuv@xmath0 color is not significantly affected by the relatively poor resolution of the _ galex _ images , we limit the sample galaxies with @xmath39 .",
    "our sample selection criteria are as follows :    \\(1 ) minor@xmath8major axis ratio @xmath40 , to minimize dust reddening effect ;    \\(2 ) 40<@xmath36<80 , to ensure that the chosen central aperture encloses @xmath41% of the total flux of a galaxy ;    \\(3 ) @xmath42 $ ] , where @xmath17 is the sdss spectroscopic redshift ;    \\(4 ) @xmath43 , where @xmath44mag is the limited magnitude in the nuv band ;    \\(5 ) stellar mass @xmath45 .",
    "the selected sample contains 8200 galaxies .",
    "we note that this sample is not volume - completed and our conclusions do not rely on the selection completeness in the volume .",
    "the stellar mass @xmath6 used in this letter was drawn from the jhu / mpa database .",
    "since all agns in our sample are narrow - line ( obscured ) agns , there should be no contribution from agn continuum to the measured nuv@xmath0 index .",
    "the properties of our sample galaxies are shown in figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "panel a ) is the color magnitude diagram .",
    "we select sfgs with nuv@xmath0<@xmath46 ( the blue dashed line ) , where @xmath6 is logarithm stellar mass . in total , a sample of 6401 sfgs is assembled .",
    "panel b ) shows the flux fraction distribution enclosed in the central @xmath47 aperture for the selected sfgs .",
    "one can see that the central aperture encloses @xmath41% of the @xmath48band total flux . in panel c ) , we show the bulge - to - total ratio b / t as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "the b / t is from the disk+bulge decomposition on the sdss @xmath32-band imaging @xcite . as can be seen ,",
    "the b / t distribution is significantly different at @xmath2 and @xmath7 , in the sense that more massive galaxies have higher b / t values .",
    "however , the majority of sfgs have a b / t<0.5 .",
    "therefore , the chosen aperture of @xmath49 is enough to separate the bulges from the disk components for the sfgs .",
    "panel d ) presents b / t as a function of the srsic index @xmath5 of the galaxy . here",
    "@xmath5 is fitted with a pure srsic model ( see @xcite for details ) . as also shown in @xcite , b",
    "/ t increases with @xmath5 .",
    "below we present our analysis results for the sample of selected sfgs .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] presents the outer and central nuv@xmath0 for our sample of sfgs . here",
    "the outer / central region of a galaxy refers to the part out / within a circular aperture of radius @xmath51 .",
    "the sfgs are divided in 6 mass bins . as one",
    "can see from panel a ) , the nuv@xmath50 is redder for more massive galaxies .",
    "however , no turning over is seen at log(@xmath52)=10.2 . in panel b ) , we show the [ nuv@xmath34]@xmath6 diagram . for comparison , we overplot the median values of the nuv@xmath50 as well .",
    "it is clear that the median value of nuv@xmath34 is only slightly redder than that of nuv@xmath50 at log(@xmath52)<10.2 , while the discrepancy between the two becomes larger at higher masses .",
    "panel c ) shows the discrepancy ( [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] ) between the two as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "note that we do not apply the internal extinction correction for the nuv@xmath0 measurements .",
    "if the extinction correction is similar for these two color indices , then [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] reflects the intrinsic difference in color , and then the difference in ssfr .",
    "as one can see , this relation bends at log(@xmath52)@xmath310.2 , which is similar to the ms . in panel d ) , we show the [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] distribution .",
    "strikingly , the three mass bins with log(@xmath52)<10.2 exhibit similar distributions peaked at [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50]@xmath30.25 mag .",
    "above log(@xmath52)=10.2 , the distributions start to shift redward .        in short ,",
    "the results presented in figure  [ fig2 ] support the argument that the bend of the ms is indeed attributed to the presence of red bulges in massive galaxies .",
    "this findings also help one in better interpreting the increasing intrinsic scatters of the ms with @xmath6 @xcite . based on the large sample",
    ", this result should be reliable in a statistical sense .",
    "interestingly , we find the trend that nuv@xmath34 is only 0.25 mag redder than nuv@xmath50 holds for a mass range of log(@xmath52)<10.2 .",
    "this indicates that the central regions of less massive galaxies still have quite high @xmath55 .",
    "this finding suggests that the mechanisms driving bulge growth of low - mass galaxies is similar to those regulating disk growth .",
    "in other words , bulges in low mass - sfgs tend to be psuedo type . given this , in the next section",
    ", we will investigate the correlations of @xmath5 with nuv@xmath0 as well as b / t .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] supports that the red bulges of log(@xmath56 galaxies are responsible ( at least partly ) for the turning over of the ms relation . in this section",
    "we address how b / t and @xmath5 correlate with the read - and - dead of central bulges .",
    "we first divide the sfgs into two categories with @xmath5<2.0 and @xmath5>2.0 . in each @xmath5 bin",
    ", we investigate the behavior of [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] as a function of b / t .",
    "we have checked that galaxies with different @xmath5 in fact have indistinguishable [ nuv@xmath50]@xmath6 relations , thus the differences of [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] between different subsamples reflect their different [ nuv@xmath34 ] distributions . in the upper panels of figure  [ fig3 ] , we show the [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] distributions as a function of b / t for the sfgs with @xmath5<2.0 . in each mass bin , the sfgs are split into 3 b / t bins .",
    "each b / t bin includes a similar galaxy number .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig3 ] , the [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] distributions are not strongly dependent on b / t .",
    "however , at @xmath57 , sfgs that with the lowest b / t tend to have bluer [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] than the other two b / t bins . in the lower panels of figure  [ fig3 ]",
    ", we show the results for those with @xmath5>2.0 .",
    "compared to the sfgs with @xmath5<2.0 , the [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] distributions of sfgs with @xmath5>2.0 are broader .",
    "as one can see , galaxies with @xmath5>2.0 dominate the red [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] end . similarly , the [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] distributions are not strongly dependent on b / t .    in figure  [ fig4 ]",
    ", we investigate the dependence of [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] on @xmath5 . to minimize the b / t effects",
    ", we show the results in two fixed b / t bins , with b / t=[0.1,0.25 ] and b / t=[0.25,0.4 ] . in both b / t bins ,",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] clearly shows that the [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] distributions are significantly different for the @xmath5<2.0 and @xmath5>2.0 sfgs . note that the result of the log ( @xmath52)=[10.2,10.5 ] bin may be affected by the relatively small number of @xmath5>2.0 sfgs .",
    "moreover , one can see the @xmath5>2.0 sfgs with b / t=[0.1,0.25 ] can have a redder [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] distribution than that of the @xmath5<2.0 sfgs with b / t=[0.25,0.4 ] .",
    "thus figure  [ fig3 ] figure  [ fig4 ] suggest that the star formation of bulges is more strongly dependent on @xmath5 than on b / t .",
    "the nuv@xmath0 color is a good proxy of ssfr . however , the color index is usually affected by metallicity and dust reddening .",
    "it is thus necessary to assess the impacts of metallicity and dust extinction on our results . in figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , we draw that nearly all galaxies have their nuv@xmath34 and nuv@xmath50 bellow 5.0 . over this range , nuv@xmath0 is mainly determined by ssfr , rather than metallicity @xcite .",
    "thus metallicity should has little influence on our results . on the other hand , if the dust reddening discrepancy between nuv@xmath34 and nuv@xmath50 increases with @xmath6 , then the results of figure  [ fig2 ] are expected .",
    "however , figure  [ fig3 ] reveals that this should not be the case because at fixed @xmath5 , the peaks of the [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] distributions do not shift redward with increasing @xmath6 .",
    "therefore the increasing color discrepancy between nuv@xmath34 and nuv@xmath50 with @xmath6 shown in figure  [ fig2 ] can only be explained by the existence of evolved bulge stellar population in more massive sfgs .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] and figure  [ fig4 ] support that the color of bulges , or the @xmath27 is strongly dependent on @xmath5 .",
    "previous works found that @xmath5 is very tightly correlated with quiescence . above a critical @xmath5 of @xmath58@xmath59 ,",
    "galaxies are mostly quenched @xcite .",
    "a high @xmath60 also indicates a dense galaxy bulge .",
    "quenched galaxies mostly host dense cores , however , galaxies with dense cores do not need to be quenched @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] and figure  [ fig4 ] indicate that the reddest bulges mostly have @xmath5>2.0 . however , high @xmath5 sfgs do not need to have red bulges .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the dense red bulges of sfgs may imply their formation histories .",
    "as already known , there exists two types of bulges , which are the so - called `` classical bulges '' and `` psuedobulges '' .",
    "the classical bulges have steep central light profile ( hence dense central stellar density ) and are believed to form through major mergers coupled with a central starburst event , during which the available fuel is exhaust relatively quickly . given this , it is thus not surprised to find that part of the high @xmath5 sfgs have a red nuv@xmath34 .",
    "in contrast , psuedobulges are the bulges that have disk - like features and believed to be the products of secular evolution ( see @xcite for a review ) . figure  [ fig3 ] and figure  [ fig4 ] show that galaxies with low @xmath5 have bluer [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] distributions , indicating more sfr in their central regions .",
    "this is consistent with the findings that psuedobulges have more gas and sfr than classical bulges @xcite .    at this point",
    "it is necessary to discuss the @xmath5 composition of sfgs .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the fractions of sfgs with @xmath5>2.0 ( @xmath61 ) as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "one can see that the @xmath61 is quite low at @xmath2 but rapidly increases to 80% 90% at @xmath62 . for comparison",
    ", we overplot the @xmath61 of the sfgs sample from @xcite , which is volume - completed to @xmath63 at @xmath64 .",
    "one can see that the two sfgs sample exhibit similar trends .",
    "given this , the ms is expected to turn flatten owing to the existence of large portion of high @xmath5 sfgs at the high masses .",
    "strikingly , [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] is found to have a weak dependence on b / t at @xmath7 , regardless of @xmath5 .",
    "it is not straightforward to interpret this result .",
    "we argue that this may be due to the complex mechanisms that drive the increasing of the b / t .",
    "the increasing of b / t can either be due to secular evolution , or due to an intense central star formation episode . in the former case",
    "one sees that high b / t sfgs tend to have low @xmath65 , while in the latter the situation is reversed .",
    "observationally , both processes can occur in a sfg sample .",
    "even for individual galaxies , they can possibly undergo both processes during their evolution .",
    "therefore , for a sfg that with a classical bulge ( or a high @xmath5 ) , the mixture of the two processes will drive its @xmath65 showing a weak dependence on b / t .    for the low @xmath5 sfgs",
    "whose central bulges are proposed to mainly form through secular evolution , we do observed galaxies with lowest b / t have bluest [ nuv@xmath34 ] at @xmath66 . however , this trend does not hold when comparing the results between the middle and the high b / t bins . to interpret this result , one must have a comprehensive picture of the bulge formation history of massive galaxies .",
    "in a recent work , @xcite shows evidence that the inner most region of some psuedobulges are imbedded with a classical bulge , suggesting that our previous proposed bulge formation pictures are over simple .",
    "we suggest a comprehensive understanding of bulge formation is needed to fully explain the findings presented in this work .",
    "in this letter , we investigate the role of bulges in shaping the @xmath6@xmath8sfr relation by comparting the nuv@xmath0 color in the central @xmath1 regions to that of the outer regions for a sample of 6401 local star - forming galaxies .",
    "we find that at @xmath2 , nuv@xmath34 is on average only @xmath30.25 mag redder than nuv@xmath50 . above @xmath4 , [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ]",
    "becomes redder when increasing @xmath6 , indicating the existence of more evolved bulges at the massive end .",
    "for the galaxies with @xmath7 , we find that those with reddest [ nuv@xmath34][nuv@xmath50 ] are preferentially to have large srsic index @xmath5 , even at fixed b / t and @xmath6 .",
    "this suggests that @xmath27 is more strongly dependent on @xmath5 ( or central mass density ) than on b / t .",
    "we conclude that the increasing fraction of low - ssfr dense bulges in @xmath7 galaxies , rather than high b / t , is responsible for the flattened slope of the @xmath6@xmath8sfr relation at high masses .",
