    "half - metallic ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic materials have been extensively studied during the last decade due to their potential application in magnetoelectronic devices.@xcite these magnetic systems present a usual metallic behavior concerning their majority - spin electrons and a semiconducting gap in the minority - spin electronic band structure and thus 100%spin - polarization at the fermi level and could in principle maximize the efficiency of spintronic devices.@xcite . as expected",
    "the main interest has been focused in the potential half - metallic magnets based on transition - metal elements but the latter due to their large spin - magnetic moments are expected to present large external stray magnetic fields and thus devices based on them should exhibit considerable energy losses . a way to detour",
    "this problem is to search for new materials presenting much smaller spin magnetic moments and to this respect a very interesting case are ferromagnetic compounds which do not contain transition - metal atoms .",
    "these are widely known in literature with various names like @xmath1 magnets , @xmath2-ferromagnets or sp - electron ferromagnets.@xcite several of them combine ferromagnetism with the desired for applications half - metallicity .",
    "there are several ways to create sp - electron ferromagnets and an extensive review is given in ref . .",
    "first , we can induce vacancies or holes at the cation sites in oxides , which lead to a small exchange - splitting of the cation spin - up and spin - down states and thus to half - metallic ferromagnetism.@xcite a second route to @xmath2-magnets are the so  called molecular solids.@xcite in these materials the oxygen or nitrogen atoms form dimers which are ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically coupled between them.@xcite the third way to create half - metallic sp - electron ferromagnets is the doping of oxides with nitrogen atoms.@xcite n impurities at anionic sites ( oxygens ) present a splitting of their @xmath2-bands and the majority - spin states are completely occupied while the minority - spin states are partially occupied leading to half - metallicity.@xcite experimental evidence for the occurrence of magnetism in n - doped mgo has been provided by liu and collaborators.@xcite    an alternative way to half - metallic @xmath3-electron ferromagnets is the growth of i / ii - iv / v nanostructures in metastable lattice structures similar to the case of transition - metal pnictides and chalcogenides in the metastable zincblende structure.@xcite several studies to this research direction have appeared following the pioneering papers published by geshi et al@xcite and kusakabe et al@xcite who have shown using first - principles calculations that cap , caas and casb alloys present half - metallic ferromagnetism when grown in the zincblende structure . ca atom provides two valence electrons ( occupying the 4s states in the free atom ) while the anions ( p , as , sb ) provide 5 valence electrons ( _ e.g. _ in free atom of as the atomic configuration is 4s@xmath4 4p@xmath5 ) . in total",
    "there are 7 valence electrons per unit cell .",
    "the first two occupy the s - valence states created by as atoms which lie deep in energy .",
    "the p - states of anions hybridize strongly with the triple - degenerated t@xmath6 d - states of ca , which transform following the same symmetry operations , and form bonding and antibonding hybrids which are separated by large energy gaps .",
    "the bonding hybrids contain mostly p - admixture while the antibonding hybrids are mainly of d - character .",
    "the remaining 5 valence electron occupy the bonding hybrids which are mainly of anionic p - character in such a way that all three majority - spin p - states are occupied while in the minority - spin band the fermi level cross the bands so that only the two out of three p - states are occupied .",
    "this gives in total a spin magnetic moment per formula unit of exactly 1 @xmath0 .",
    "this mechanism is similar for all half - metallic ferromagnetic i / ii - iv / v alloys in all three zincblende ( zb ) , wurtzite ( wz ) and rocksalt ( rs ) metastable structures , and the spin magnetic moment follows a slater - pauling behavior with the total spin magnetic per formula unit in @xmath0 being 8 minus the number of valence electron in the unit cell : @xmath7 .",
    "evidence of the growth of such nanosctructures has been provided by liu et al who have reported successful self - assembly growth of ultrathin can in the rocksalt structure on top of cu(001).@xcite finally we have to note that materials containing c or n seem to be more promising for applications since the hund energy for the light atoms in the second row of the periodic table is similar to the hund energy of the 3d transition metal atoms .",
    "following the refs . and",
    "mentioned in the previous paragraph a lot of studies on such compounds have appeared based on first principles calculations and we will give a short overview of them .",
    "although extensive studies exist also for the alkali metal alloys@xcite and the alkaline earth chalcogenides,@xcite most of the attention has been focused on the alkaline - earth metal ( iind column ) compounds with the vth - column elements and mainly the nitrides.@xcite sieberer et al studied all possible ii - v combinations in the zb and wz structures and found that all alloys containing ca , sr and ba are half - metallic while only mgn was half - metallic between the mg - based compounds.@xcite it was also shown in ref .",
    "that the ferromagnetic state is energetically preferable to both the non - magnetic and the antiferromagnetic configurations .",
    "volnianska and boguslawski , as well as geshi and collaborators have studied the alkaline - earth metal nitrides and have shown that the rs is the more stable structure with formation anergies of about -11 ev per unit cell.@xcite gao et al have shown that among the rs alloys containing ca , sr or ba as a cation and n , p or as as an anion only the nitrides are stable half - metallic ferromagnets with a total spin magnetic moment of 1 @xmath0 and cohesive energies about -9 ev per formula unit.@xcite droghetti and collaborators have shown that rs - mgn is in verge of the half - metallicity and suggested that mgn inclusion upon the n - doping of mgo should lead to a material suitable for magnetic tunnel junctions.@xcite the most recent studies on nitrides concern the curie temperature in the zb - structure which was found to be 430 k in can,@xcite and the rs - can / zb - inn and rs - srn / zb - gap ( 111 ) interfaces which were found to retain half - metallicity only when the interface is made up from ca - n or n - in atoms in the first case and n - ga in the second case.@xcite",
    "as we can conclude from the discussion in the previous section , rocksalt alkaline - earth metal nitrides combine some unique properties among these alloys : they have a small spin magnetic moment per formula unit ( 1 @xmath0 ) and thus create small external magnetic fields , ( ii ) they present very stable half - metallicity upon hydrostatic pressure , ( iii ) their equilibrium lattice constant are close to a lot of semiconductors , ( iv ) results on the zb - structure suggest high values of the curie temperature also for the rs - structure , ( v ) the half - metallic gaps are wide , and ( vi ) interfaces with semiconductors retain half - metallicity .",
    "thus in this manuscript we complete the previous studies on the rs can and srn alloys focusing on properties which have not yet been determined . in the first part of our study we employ the augmented spherical waves method ( asw)@xcite within the atomic  sphere approximation ( asa)@xcite in conjunction to the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) for the exchange - correlation potential @xcite to perform ground state electronic structure calculations for rs can and srn using the lattice constants from ref .",
    "( 5.02   for can and 5.37   for srn ) .",
    "notice that within asw , empty spheres have been used , where needed , in order to describe better the lattice filling .",
    "we use these results and the frozen - magnon technique@xcite to determine the exchange constants and curie temperature in both the mean - field ( mfa ) and random - phase ( rpa ) approximations .",
    "the formalism has been already presented for a one - sublattice system like the ones under study ( only n - n interactions contribute since the ca(sr ) atoms have negligible spin magnetic moments ) in ref . .",
    "then using a rigid band model as in ref .",
    "we study how the exchange constants , curie temperature , spin - polarization and spin magnetic moments vary with the band - filling .",
    "in the second part of our study we employ the full  potential nonorthogonal local  orbital minimum  basis band structure scheme ( fplo)@xcite within the gga approximation@xcite to determine the equilibrium lattice constants of rocksalt can and srn which are found to be almost identical to the results of geshi et al.@xcite we , thereafter , study the effect on the electronic and magnetic properties of tetragonalization keeping the volume of the unit cell constant which usually accounts for growth on different substrates . to make this study more complete we compare these results with the results also on the zincblende lattice structure .    .calculated magnetic properties for the can and srn alloys in the rocksalt structure using the asw method .",
    "the spin magnetic moments are given in @xmath0 units and the curie temperatures in kelvin .",
    "the lattice constants are the ones determined in ref . .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in the second part of our study we will focus on the stability of half - metallicity against lattice deformations . to carry out these calculations",
    "as stated in section [ sec2 ] we have employed the fplo@xcite code , which is a full potential code and thus is expected to describe tetragonal deformations more accurately than the asw@xcite code which employs the atomic sphere approximation.@xcite since we are interested in deformations the first step is to calculate the equilibrium lattice constants using total energy calculations . to this respect",
    "we have employed the gga approximation which is well - known to produce more accurately results concerning the elastic properties than the local - spin density approximation ( lsda ) . for can in the rocksalt structure we found an equilibrium lattice constant of 5.02   and for srn 5.39  .",
    "these values are almost identical to the results of geshi and collaborators who found for rocksalt can and srn 5.02    and 5.37  , respectively . to make our study on deformations more complete we have also included the case of zincblende can and srn since the tetragonalization effect has not yet been studied for this structure .",
    "our fplo - gga total energy calculations gave as an equilibrium lattice constant of 5.45 for can and 5.82   for srn in the zb - lattice .",
    "the lattice constant of the zb cubic unit cell is larger than in the rs - structure since in the former case it also contains two void sites while no voids are present in the rs - case . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we present the total dos for both compounds and for both zb and rs lattices at the equilibrium lattice constants . in the rs - case",
    "our dos within fplo are similar to the asw dos in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the zb - cases the bands are more narrow than the rs - structure and again both can and srn are half - metallic ferromagnets with a total spin magnetic in the formula unit of 1 @xmath0 . for the zb - lattice",
    "the half - metallic gaps are considerable larger being around 0.5 ev for srn and slightly larger for can .    to simulate deformation of the lattices with respect to equilibrium we took into account the case of tetragonalization where we vary both the in - plane and out - of - plane parameters keeping the unit cell volume constant to the equilibrium .",
    "such a deformation is expected to model the growth of the materials under study on different substrates . in table",
    "[ table2 ] we have gathered our results concerning the spin magnetic moments for srn in both rs- and zb - lattices .",
    "we do not present the results for can since the effect of deformation is identical for both alloys although their electronic band structure in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] present slight differences . in the second column we present the percentage of change ; `` - '' means compression by that percentage and `` + '' means expansion , and the percentage refers to the in - plane lattice constants .",
    "we took six values of the percentage into account : @xmath81 % , @xmath85 % and @xmath810 % .. in all cases the srn compound remains half - metallic in both the rs and zb structures with a total spin magnetic moment of 1 @xmath0 .",
    "deformations lead to small changes of the absolute values of the sr and n atomic spin magnetic moments of less than 0.01 @xmath0 in such a way that they cancel each other keeping the total spin moment constant . even in the case of can ( not presented here ) in the rs structure where the half - metallic gap is only 0.1 ev ( see discussion in section [ sec3 ] ) the half metallic character is preserved even for a @xmath810 deformation .",
    "our calculated dos ( note presented ) confirm the conclusion drawn from the spin magnetic moments and are identical to the ideal cubic lattice for all degrees of tetragonalization under study .",
    "finally we should also shortly comment on the expected behavior of the curie temperature upon tetragonalization . in refs",
    "and it was shown by means of first - principles calculations that the curie temperature in heusler compounds increases with increasing hydrostatic pressure which is in agreement with the initial castellitz interaction curve based on experiments for transition metal compounds@xcite and its recent generalization for heusler alloys by kanomata and collaborators.@xcite for the sp - electron ferromagnets under study we expect a similar behavior since in ref .",
    "we have shown that the curie temperature is very sensitive to the lattice spacing in zincblende pnictides and this also led to the larger curie temperature for can with respect to srn ( the former has smaller lattice parameter ) .",
    "tetragonalization keeping the volume constant is not expected to change the curie temperature .",
    "if , e.g. , we have smaller exchange parameters within the @xmath9-plane with respect to the equilibrium due to expansion , the compression in the out of - plane @xmath10-axis will lead to larger exchange constants , eventually compensating each other . only in cases where strain induces volume changes , like in the case of hydrostatic pressure or tetragonalization keeping the in - plane lattice parameters constant",
    ", one could expect variation in the estimated curie temperatures .",
    "half - metallic ferromagnets , which do not contain transition metal atoms , are attractive for applications due to the smaller spin magnetic moments . among these so - called sp - electron ferromagnets the case of alkaline - earth metal mononitrides crystallizing in the rocksalt , wurtzite or zincblende structures are promising since",
    "the half - metallicity is combined with a total spin - magnetic moment of 1 @xmath0 per formula unit leading to minimal energy losses in spintronic applications .",
    "moreover their equilibrium lattice constant makes them suitable for growth on top of a variety of semiconductors .    in the present study we have concentrated on the rocksalt structure of can and srn which",
    "is energetically favored with respect to the wurtzite and zincblende ones .",
    "employing electronic - structure calculations in conjunction with the generalized gradient approximation and using the frozen - magnon technique we have studied the temperature dependent properties upon varying the electron counting .",
    "both alloys were found to present curie temperature above the room temperature ( 480 k for can and 415 k for srn using the random - phase approximation ) . upon small degrees of doping either with electrons or holes the curie temperature presented only a small decrease from its maximum value , and we had to dope it with @xmath110.6 electrons or @xmath110.5 holes per formula unit for the curie temperature to become comparable to the room temperature . at the zero electron counting ( no doping )",
    "both the nearest and next - nearest n - n interaction favored ferromagnetism ; as we dope with electrons their intensity decrease , while as we dope with holes the nearest n - n exchange interaction becomes more sizeable while the next - nearest n - n interaction starts favoring an antiferromagnetic configuration leading to the decrease of the curie temperature .    in the second part of our study we studied the response of both the electronic and magnetic properties upon tetragonalization keeping the unit cell volume constant . except the rocksalt we performed calculations also for the zincblende lattice for both can and srn . in all cases under study",
    "the half - metallicity was preserved and both the electronic and magnetic properties only marginally changed . moreover , since the unit cell volume remains constant , also the curie temperature is not expected to vary .    thus we can conclude that these materials are promising for applications since small degrees of doping or large deformations keep intact the half - metallic character and a high value for the curie temperature and their controlled experimental growth is expected to boost the interest on sp - electron ferromagnets ."
