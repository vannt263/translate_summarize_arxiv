    "almost 40 years ago stuart kauffman proposed random boolean networks ( rbns ) for modelling gene regulatory networks @xcite . since then , beside its original purpose",
    ", the model and its modifications have been applied to many different phenomena like cell differentiation @xcite , immune response @xcite , evolution @xcite , opinion formation @xcite , neural networks @xcite , and even quantum gravity problems @xcite .",
    "the original rbns were represented by a set of @xmath0 elements , @xmath1 , each element @xmath2 having two possible states : active ( @xmath3 ) , or inactive ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath2 was controlled by @xmath5 other elements of the network , i.e. @xmath6 where @xmath5 was a fixed parameter .",
    "the functions @xmath7 were selected so that they have returned values @xmath3 and @xmath4 with probabilities respectively equal to @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath8 have determined the dynamics of the system ( kauffman network ) , and it has been shown that for a given probability @xmath8 , there exists the critical number of inputs @xcite @xmath10 below which all perturbations in the initial state of the system die out ( _ frozen phase _ ) , and above which a small perturbation in the initial state of the system may propagate across the entire network ( _ chaotic phase _ ) .",
    "in fact , the behavior of kauffman model in the vicinity of the critical line @xmath11 has become a major concern of scientists interested in gene regulatory networks .",
    "the main reason for this was the conjecture that living organisms operate in a region between order and complete randomness or chaos ( the so - called _ edge of chaos _ ) where both complexity and rate of evolution are maximized @xcite .",
    "the analogous behavior has been noticed in kauffman networks , which in the interesting region described by eq .",
    "( [ eq_kauffman ] ) show stability , homeostatis , and the ability to cope with minor modifications when mutated .",
    "the networks are stable as well as flexible in this region .",
    "recently , when data from real networks have become available @xcite , a quantitative comparison of the _ edge of chaos _ in these datasets and rbn models has brought an encouraging and promising message that even such simple model may quite well mimic characteristics of real systems .",
    "since , however , one has noticed that real genetic networks exhibit a wide range of connectivities , the recent modifications of the standard rbn take into consideration a distribution of nodes degrees @xmath12 .",
    "it has been shown that if the random topology of the directed network is homogeneous ( i.e. all elements of the network are statistically equivalent ) , then the network topology can be meaningfully characterized by the average in - degree @xmath13 , and the transition between frozen and chaotic phase occurs for @xcite : @xmath14    several authors @xcite have provided a general formula for the edge of chaos in directed networks characterized by the joint degree distribution @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath5 and @xmath17 correspond to in- and out - degrees of the same node , respectively .",
    "the formula ( [ lee_eq ] ) shows that the position of the critical line depends on the correlations between @xmath5 and @xmath17 in such networks .",
    "it is also easy to show that the previous results ( [ eq_kauffman ] ) and ( [ eq_sole ] ) immediately follow from ( [ lee_eq ] ) if one assumes the lack of correlations @xmath18 .",
    "very recently , it has been shown by finite size scaling methods ( fss ) that the critical connectivity @xmath19 significantly deviates from the value established by the eq .",
    "( [ eq_sole ] ) , even for large system sizes @xcite .",
    "more precisely , one observes that @xmath20 . to support the observation the authors recall other studies @xcite which suggest that gene regulatory networks appear to be in the ordered regime and reside slightly below the phase transition between order and chaos in opposite to the theory which proposes the critical line to be an evolutionary attractor .    in the present paper ,",
    "we suggest other explanation of the observed discrepancy .",
    "we show ( both analytically and numerically ) that the discrepancies are due to the percolation phenomena , which become important in the region of small values of the parameter @xmath21 .    to understand the complexity of percolation phenomena in directed graphs let us recall the structure of such a graph @xcite . in general , a directed graph consists of a giant weakly connected component ( gwcc ) and several finite components ( fcs ) . in the gwcc",
    "every site is reachable from every other , provided that the links are treated as bidirectional .",
    "the gwcc is further divided into a giant strongly connected component ( gscc ) , consisting of all sites reachable from each other following directed links .",
    "all sites reachable from the gscc are referred to as the giant out component , and the sites from which the gscc is reachable are referred to as the giant in component .",
    "the gscc is the intersection of the in and out components .",
    "all sites in the gwcc , but not in the in and out components , are referred to as the tendrils ( tds ) ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "size of all components listed above has doubtless impact on propagation of perturbations in directed rbns .",
    "moreover , gscc and gwcc start to form at different values of the parameter @xmath21 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) .",
    "although it has been shown @xcite how to find the relative sizes of the components ( for example gwcc appears when @xmath22 ) , the problem of how to implement the results to the theory of perturbation spreading in rbns is still far from being solved . to make the first step in this direction , and to show the importance of percolation phenomena on dynamics of rbn we concentrate on undirected case of the model .",
    "although the original rbns have been defined as directed ones , the study of undirected networks significantly reduces complexity of the problem ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .        to this end",
    ", we organize the paper as follows . in the next section , we present numerical methodology and finite - size scaling of perturbation spreading in rbns . in section 3",
    "we derive general relation describing position of the critical line in undirected rbns with arbitrary distribution of connections @xmath12 , in the analogy of the mean - field theory for directed rbns @xcite . comparing the theory with numerical simulations",
    "we show significant deviations between the both approaches .",
    "then an improved treatment including percolation phenomena is presented in section 4 .",
    "a summary of our findings is given in section 5 .",
    "in order to find the position of the critical line in rbn one has to examine the sensitivity of its dynamics with regard to initial conditions . in numerical studies such",
    "a sensitivity can be analyzed quite simply .",
    "one has to start with two initial states @xmath23 and @xmath24 , which are identical except for a small number of elements , and observe how the differences between both configurations @xmath25 and @xmath26 change in time . if a system is robust then the studied configurations lead to similar long - time behavior , otherwise the differences develop in time . a suitable measure for the distance between the configurations",
    "is the overlap @xmath27 defined as @xmath28 note , that in the limit @xmath29 , the overlap becomes the probability for two arbitrary but corresponding elements , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , to be equal .",
    "moreover , the stationary long - time limit of the overlap @xmath32 can be treated as the order parameter of the system . if @xmath33 then the system is insensitive to initial perturbations ( frozen phase ) , while for @xmath34 , the initial perturbations propagate across the entire network ( chaotic phase ) .    for numerical purposes we define",
    "the probability @xmath35 that the system is sensitive to perturbations @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the number of generated networks , and @xmath38 is the number of system updates . in our simulations",
    "we take @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "[ fig3]a presents a typical example of @xmath35 dependence on our control parameter @xmath41 for different network sizes .",
    "then , we apply finite - size scaling method @xcite to determine how the probability @xmath35 scales with the system size . around some critical point",
    ", we predict that systems of all sizes are indistinguishable except for a change of scale .",
    "this suggests @xmath42 where @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ fss ] ) , @xmath44 is one of the functions shown in the figure 3a , @xmath45 is the critical point , and @xmath46 provides the change of scale .",
    "[ fig3]b shows how the probability @xmath35 depends on the parameter @xmath47 with fitted parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 .     against a ) control parameter @xmath50 and b ) rescaled parameter @xmath47 for @xmath51.,width=415 ]",
    "the other problem which should be noted here is the observation that @xmath45 depends on the number of initially perturbed nodes . in the fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot the dependence of normalized critical connectivity @xmath52 against the number @xmath53 of initially perturbed nodes in the network of @xmath54 elements . for further calculations we choose @xmath55 ,",
    "since then the error in @xmath45 is less than the error arising in finite - size scaling",
    ".     elements .",
    "lines are shown only for better visibility of the presented dependence.,width=226 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , using the method described above , we show the numerically obtained values of @xmath45 against the parameter @xmath8 . for @xmath51",
    "critical connectivity is minimal , i.e. @xmath56 .",
    "please note that the size of the giant component for this connectivity is about one half of the whole network .",
    "one can expect that a large number of isolated nodes and clusters can significantly affect the perturbation spreading rate in this regime .",
    "moreover , it has been demonstrated @xcite , that the giant component is correlated in sparse networks . in the following",
    ", we will show that a mean field theory which does not take into account these percolation and correlation issues , although correct for large values of @xmath41 , deviates from numerical results for @xmath41 close to @xmath3 .    )",
    "in this section , we derive a mean field formula for the critical line characterizing kauffman boolean model in undirected and uncorrelated random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions @xmath12 . to this end , we partially reproduce and generalize a simple annealed calculations that have been for the first time carried out by derrida and pomeau @xcite . the case of random directed networks has been studied by aldana @xcite , and also by lee and rieger @xcite .",
    "thus , let @xmath57 corresponds to the probability that a given element @xmath58 of degree @xmath5 possesses the same value in both configurations @xmath25 and @xmath26 of the considered boolean network , i.e. @xmath59 .",
    "it occurs either when all the @xmath5 inputs of @xmath30 are equal to respective inputs of @xmath60 , or when the function @xmath7 , cf .",
    "( [ fi ] ) , ascribed to the node @xmath58 returns the same value for these two configurations .",
    "the first case happens with probability @xmath61 where @xmath62 represents probability that in the previous time step @xmath63 the @xmath64th nearest neighbor of @xmath58 having degree @xmath65 was in the same state in the two considered configurations .",
    "it is also easy to see that the second case arises with probability @xmath66 , when at least one of the @xmath5 inputs of @xmath2 differs from its counterpart in @xmath67 giving rise to the same values of @xmath2 and @xmath67 .",
    "such a situation , in turn , happens with probability equal to @xmath68 .",
    "taking all the above together we find that the probability @xmath57 that @xmath59 is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 stand for degrees of nodes found in the nearest neighborhood of the node @xmath58 .",
    "the equation ( [ af1 ] ) describes dynamics of a single node @xmath58 of degree @xmath5 . in order to study boolean dynamics of the whole network one has to average the equation , first over the nearest neighborhood of @xmath58 , next over the whole network .",
    "the first step simply means averaging over the distribution @xmath71 , which describes probability that nearest neighbors of @xmath58 have degrees respectively equal to @xmath70 @xmath72 whereas the second step corresponds to averaging of the last equation over the node degree distribution @xmath12 characterizing the whole network .",
    "note , that we have omitted the subscript @xmath58 at @xmath73 in eq .",
    "( [ af2 ] ) . after averaging",
    ", @xmath73 refers to the set of nodes having the same degree @xmath5 .    at the moment , before we proceed with our calculations let us outline structural properties of the studied networks . at the beginning",
    "let us remind that the assumed lack of higher - order correlations ( e.g. three - point or four - point correlations ) means that a given link @xmath74 does not influence other links of the considered nodes @xmath58 and @xmath64 .",
    "it translates to the fact that the conditional probability @xmath71 factorizes @xmath75 where @xmath76 describes probability that a node of degree @xmath65 is the nearest neighbor of a node having degree @xmath5 .",
    "given the formulas ( [ af0 ] ) , ( [ af4 ] ) and ( [ af5 ] ) , the equation ( [ af2 ] ) further simplifies as follows @xmath77 where , since we are interested in the stationary ( i.e. for @xmath78 ) solutions of this equation , we have omitted dependence on time @xmath79 .",
    "considered in the text .",
    "the solid line corresponds to the situation when the only stable solution is @xmath80 , i.e. @xmath81 for all values of @xmath5 .",
    "the dashed line shows the case when the second solution @xmath82 appears.,width=226 ]    now , assuming the lack of two point correlations , i.e. @xmath83 which causes that the nearest neighborhood of each node is the same ( in statistical terms ) , and then multiplying both sides of eq .",
    "( [ af6 ] ) by @xmath5 , and finally averaging the resulting equation over the node degree distribution @xmath12 , we get the desired mean - field equation which describes stationary states of the kauffman model defined on undirected and uncorrelated random networks with arbitrary degree distributions @xmath84 where @xmath85 .    at the moment , note that the state @xmath86 , which in fact corresponds to the set of conditions @xmath81 for all nodes degrees @xmath5 , is always a solution of the last equation , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . note also , that this solution may be stable or unstable depending on properties of the considered map @xmath87 , where @xmath88 ( [ af7 ] ) .",
    "in fact , one can show that the solution loses its stability , when another solution @xmath89 of this equation appears .",
    "for the first time it happens when @xmath90 where the limit @xmath91 is equivalent to @xmath92 . substituting ( [ af7 ] ) into ( [ af8 ] )",
    "we get the condition for the phase transition between ordered and chaotic behavior of the kauffman model defined on undirected and uncorrelated random network @xmath93 where @xmath13 and @xmath94 stand for the first and the second moment of the degree distribution @xmath12 , respectively . in the following we",
    "briefly analyze the formula for the critical line ( [ af9 ] ) in classical random graphs .",
    "the case of scale - free networks @xmath95 , for which the second moment @xmath96 of the degree distribution becomes important , has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "thus , since in classical random graphs @xmath97 , the formula ( [ af9 ] ) simplifies @xmath98 in the fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] one can see numerical simulations of the kauffman boolean model defined on these graphs as compared with the expression ( [ af10 ] ) . in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we have suggested that the visible discrepancy between numerical calculations and their theoretical prediction for @xmath99 ( i.e. for @xmath100 ) may result from the fact that @xmath101 corresponds to the percolation threshold in these networks .",
    "a simple heuristic argument behind this statement was the following : because the size of the largest component near @xmath101 is significantly smaller than the network size ( the network is divided into several disconnected components ) , any perturbation can not propagate across the entire system , and the frozen phase is easier achieved .",
    "it means that the closer percolation threshold @xmath102 we are , the more crumbled network ( separated pieces of the whole system ) we analyze , and the theoretical prediction given by eq .",
    "( [ af10 ] ) works worse and worse .",
    "in fact , comparing the general formula @xmath103 @xcite for the percolation threshold in arbitrary undirected and uncorrelated random network with the general expression for the critical line ( [ af9 ] ) , one can show that the arguments exposed in relation to classical random graphs should also apply for the whole class of the considered networks .    in the next section",
    "we show how to adjust the approach presented in this section in order to correctly describe properties of the analyzed systems in the whole range of parameters , also in the vicinity of the percolation transition .",
    "in the following , in order to correctly address the problem of damage spreading in the vicinity of percolation transition , that has been outlined at the end of the previous section , we use a few important results on percolation phenomena in the considered class of networks . to begin with",
    ", we recall these results .",
    "as we are going to directly ( i.e. in the course of numerical simulations ) check our derivations in classical random graphs , together with general formulas describing behavior of arbitrary undirected and uncorrelated random networks we also provide the respective formulas for these graphs .",
    "thus , as we have already mentioned , random graph with a given node degree distribution @xmath12 does not need to be connected .",
    "however , if @xmath104 that in classical random graphs translates into @xmath105 the giant component @xmath106 emerges which gathers a finite fraction of all nodes and links .",
    "the size of the giant component @xmath107 , i.e. the probability that an arbitrary node belongs to @xmath106 , is given by the below formula @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the solution of the self - consistency equation @xmath110 and @xmath111 is the probability that a link belongs to the giant component .",
    "the functions @xmath112 and @xmath113 correspond to generating functions of the node degree distribution @xmath12 , and the conditional distribution @xmath76 ( [ af5 ] ) , respectively . since in classical random graphs",
    "@xmath114 , the formula ( [ af13 ] ) for these networks significantly simplifies @xmath115 and the expression for @xmath109 becomes @xmath116    the general results on percolation transition in random undirected and uncorrelated networks outlined in the previous paragraph are already well - known .",
    "they have been derived by several authors using different theoretical approaches , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "recently , however , a new interesting results completing our knowledge in this subject have been obtained by biaas and ole @xcite .",
    "the authors have shown that the neighboring nodes in the giant connected components are disassortatively correlated .",
    "they have also derived analytic formulas for the node degree distribution @xmath117 and the joint nearest - neighbor degree distribution @xmath118 characterizing the giant component .",
    "let us note , that in the limit @xmath119 , when the giant component covers the whole network @xmath120 , the both distributions @xmath121 and @xmath122 respectively converge to distributions @xmath12 and @xmath15 , which characterize random uncorrelated networks .",
    "the formulas ( [ af17 ] ) and ( [ af18 ] ) are crucial for the further developments of this paper , as they show that although in average the considered networks are uncorrelated , in the vicinity of percolation transition their giant components are disassortative ( note that we still do not know anything about higher - order correlations in @xmath106s ) .",
    "now , since we know that this type of correlations makes different spreading - like phenomena more difficult @xcite , we expect that disassortativity of the giant component is partially responsible for the discrepancy observed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , with the crumbling of the system as a whole being the second reason .",
    "below , we show that taking these effects into consideration significantly improves theoretical prediction for the critical line in the kauffman model defined on random uncorrelated networks .",
    "thus , let us study damage spreading within the giant component of the considered networks .",
    "knowing properties of this cluster , we can start our analysis from eq .",
    "( [ af6 ] ) , which is valid for the general class of networks with two - point correlations .",
    "the conditional probability @xmath123 for the giant component can be calculated from the standard expression @xcite @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the average degree characterizing this component . inserting ( [ af17 ] ) and ( [ af18 ] ) into ( [ af19 ] ) we get @xmath126 where @xmath127 is given by ( [ af5 ] ) .",
    "the last formula ( [ af21 ] ) can be also written in the equivalent form @xmath128 which turns out to be useful in our further developments .",
    "now , let us apply the equation ( [ af6 ] ) to the giant component @xmath129 due to the complicated form of the conditional distribution @xmath130 ( [ af21 ] ) , it is impossible to deduce on possible solutions of the equation ( [ af23 ] ) in the same way as we have done it for the case of uncorrelated networks .",
    "however , substituting ( [ af22 ] ) into ( [ af23 ] ) we obtain @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 next , applying a mean field approximation to eq .",
    "( [ af24 ] ) @xmath134 we get the simplified equation @xmath135 which after some algebra , consisting in multiplying both sides of this equation by @xmath136 and then averaging it over @xmath137 , further simplifies and becomes equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ af7 ] ) @xmath138    the equivalence of the two equations ( [ af7 ] ) and ( [ af29 ] ) is visible when @xmath119 ( i.e. @xmath120 ) .",
    "then , the parameter @xmath139 , see eqs .",
    "( [ af25 ] ) and ( [ af27 ] ) , simplifies as follows @xmath140 where the averages @xmath141 and @xmath142 have their standard meaning ( in our calculations @xmath143 always refers to the giant component ) .",

    "( [ af29 ] ) , as the one performed in the reference case of uncorrelated networks , compare eqs .",

    "[ fig7 ] one can see that numerical simulations quite tally with the theoretical prediction of eq .",
    "( [ af31 ] ) . given the figure , we would also like to take note of two other interesting effects related to the analyzed problem .",
    "first , the critical line characterizing the giant component significantly differs from the curve described by the formula ( [ af9 ] ) .",
    "it is shifted towards the numerically obtained critical line characterizing the whole network .",
    "the observation is in some sense promising , as it partially confirms the main proposition of this paper , which states that the percolation transition is responsible for discrepancies observed in fig .",
    "the second effect concerns mutual relationship between the behavior of the giant component and the behavior of the whole network .",
    "since one knows that the giant component makes up a macroscopic part of the network ( it grows linearly with the network size @xmath0 , and becomes infinite in the thermodynamic limit @xmath29 ) one could expect that dynamics of the whole network should reflect behavior of the giant component .",
    "thus , the question is , why the numerically obtained critical line characterizing the whole network differs from the theoretical prediction for the giant component . in other words ,",
    "why , for the set of parameters marked by the light gray area in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , the chaotic behavior of the giant component is not visible in the whole network .    to solve the problem stated at the end of the last paragraph ,",
    "let us briefly recall what the numerical simulations of the kauffman model consist in .",
    "thus , in numerical studies we check how the initial perturbation of the system @xmath152 ( [ saf1 ] ) , where @xmath153 , develops over time . in general , when the parameter @xmath154",
    "we identify the system as the chaotic one . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath155 we treat it as being in the ordered phase .",
    "in reality , however , due to the fact that in the vicinity of the percolation transition the considered kauffman networks are strongly heterogenous , they consist of the giant component which is escorted by a number of small tree - like clusters and isolated nodes , the systems should by treated more carefully .",
    "to better describe the situation let us choose the system parameters from the region that is marked by the light gray color in fig .",
    "then , we introduce a quantity @xmath156 , which measures _ chaoticity _ in the system as a mean damage size caused by a single node perturbation . if @xmath157 then mean damage size grows(shrinks ) in time .",
    "condition @xmath158 will allow us to derive the relation for the critical line in the whole network .",
    "let us now divide the network into three parts : giant connected component ( gc ) , finite clusters ( fcs ) and isolated points ( ips ) .",
    "the figure [ fig8 ] shows schematically how the single node perturbation evolves in time in these three parts of the network . in studied range of parameters",
    "the giant component behaves chaotically , i.e. the mean damage size is larger than initial perturbation and @xmath159 . on the other hand ,",
    "the small density of connections in finite tree - like clusters does not allow perturbation to spread out and @xmath160 . because the state of isolated nodes does not change in time , then @xmath161 .",
    "now , if one perturb randomly a set of nodes in the whole network , fraction @xmath107 of perturbations will be located in gc , fraction @xmath162 will be located in fcs , and the rest of them , i.e. @xmath163 will perturb isolated nodes . now one can write the condition for transition from the frozen to the chaotic state in the whole network : @xmath164 where @xmath156 , @xmath12 and @xmath107 depend on @xmath13 .",
    "this equation shows that the ordered behavior of small clusters can shield the chaotic behavior of the giant component .",
    "only when _ chaoticity _ in gc is sufficiently developed , this shielding effect becomes neglected .",

    "we derived a mean field formula for the critical line characterizing kbn model in undirected and uncorrelated random graphs with arbitrary degree distributions .",
    "we have shown that the results of classical mean field theory differ from these obtained by numerical simulations .",
    "we have shown also that , to explain the discrepancies one has to take into account the effect of correlations between adjoining nodes in the giant connected component as well as the effect of shielding by finite size clusters .",
    "as one can see the problem is not easy even for undirected networks .",
    "as we have shown in figure 1 and 2 a directedness of the network introduces further complications into calculations .",

    "<S> we show that to correctly describe the position of the critical line in the kauffman random boolean networks one must take into account percolation phenomena underlying the process of damage spreading . for this reason , since the issue of percolation transition is much simpler in random undirected networks , than in the directed ones , we study the kauffman model in undirected networks . we derive the mean field formula for the critical line in the giant components of these networks , and show that the critical line characterizing the whole network results from the fact that the ordered behavior of small clusters shields the chaotic behavior of the giant component . we also show a possible attitude towards the analytical description of the shielding effect . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical derivations given in this paper quite tally with numerical simulations done for classical random graphs . </S>"
