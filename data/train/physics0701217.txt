    "many - body systems with dipolar interactions have attracted a lot of attention recently . unlike the properties of ultracold atomic alkali vapors , which can be described to a very good approximation by a single scattering quantity ( the @xmath0-wave scattering length ) , those of dipolar gases additionally depend on the dipole moment .",

    "this paper investigates the physics of doubly - occupied optical lattice sites in the regime where the tunneling between neighboring sites and the interactions with dipoles located in other lattice sites can be neglected . in this case",

    "the interaction between the two aligned dipoles is angle - dependent and falls off as @xmath2 at large interparticle distances . in this work ,",
    "we replace the shape - dependent interaction potential by an angle - dependent zero - range pseudo - potential , which is designed to reproduce the scattering properties of the full shape - dependent interaction potential , and derive an implicit eigenequation for two interacting identical bosonic dipoles and two interacting identical fermionic dipoles analytically .    replacing the full interaction potential or a shape - dependent pseudo - potential by a zero - range pseudo - potential  @xcite often allows for an analytical description of ultracold two - body systems in terms of a few key physical quantities . here",
    "we show that the eigenequation for appropriately chosen zero - range pseudo - potentials reproduces the energy spectrum of two dipoles under harmonic confinement interacting through a shape - dependent model potential ; that the applied zero - range treatment readily leads to an approximate classification scheme of the energy spectrum in terms of angular momentum quantum numbers ; and that the proposed pseudo - potential treatment breaks down when the characteristic length of the dipolar interaction becomes comparable to the characteristic length of the external confinement .",
