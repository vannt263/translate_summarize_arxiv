    "in the current models of hierarchical structure formation , clusters of galaxies grow through continuous mergers with groups or clusters .",

    "there are various evidences for cluster mergers seen in intracluster medium ( icm ) : complex density and temperature distribution , shocks , and radio halos and relics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is known that a cluster merger event , which is one of the most extreme phenomena in the universe , releases an enormous amount of energy ( @xmath1 ergs ) , resulting in several active phenomena .",
    "however , the effect of the cluster merger on cluster galaxies is still poorly understood @xcite , and one of the current key questions on clusters is waiting for an answer : does the merging between clusters trigger / suppress star formation ( sf ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) activity ?",
    "there were several studies to investigate the effect of the cluster merger on cluster galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that there is a large fraction of early - type galaxies showing enhanced balmer absorption lines or emission lines in coma cluster , indicating the presence of recent sf or nuclear activity .",
    "these active galaxies are located at the region between the cluster centre and the subcluster .",
    "they extended their study to five other nearby clusters @xcite , and suggested that the merger between the cluster and subcluster may trigger sf in galaxies .",
    "other studies also found evidences for an enhanced galaxy activity possibly triggered by the cluster merger @xcite .    on the other hand @xcite found no evidence for enhanced fraction of blue galaxies in the region between two subclusters in a merging cluster a168 .",
    "@xcite also found a reduced radio loudness ( or reduced agn / sf activity ) of the galaxies in the shapley supercluster .",
    "this can be explained by the effect of enhanced ram - pressure occurring when galaxies cross the shock front of merging clusters .",
    "recently , @xcite found that the agn fraction is the largest in the merging clusters , while @xcite found no correlation between the number fraction of blue galaxies and the probability of substructure in clusters .",
    "numerical simulations also show diverse results .",
    "the sf activity during the cluster merger can be triggered by a time - dependent tidal gravitational field of the merging @xcite , and by an increased ram - pressure of icm @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast the star formation rates of galaxies in the cluster merger can be decreased because of increased ram - pressure @xcite .",
    "the diverse results of galaxy properties due to the cluster merger might be due to the facts that the clusters are in different merging stages and that the initial conditions of the merging ( cluster mass , galaxy morphology , richness of gas , _",
    "etc_. , ) are different .",

    "the existence of the galaxies with sf / agn activity in the region between two subclusters could be also a result of overlapping of the outskirts of two subclusters located at slightly different distance along the line of sight .",

    "it is noted that the existence of no acceptable solutions in the bound region may be also due to the wrong assumption of two - body model ( e.g. , merging with no angular momentum ) .",

    "the velocity distribution of galaxies in a1750 e is far from gaussian , and the velocity dispersion and virial mass for a1750 e are abnormally large , indicating that it may not be a genuine subcluster currently .",
    "the past interaction of a1750 e with a1750 c is suspected by the facts that the compression of x - ray image is to the direction of east @xcite , and that a1750 e is much more smoothly connected to a1750 c compared to a1750 s as shown in the galaxy number density map .",
    "interestingly , there is one active galaxy on the line connecting a1750 e and c , and there are two active galaxies ( one early type and one late type ) just to the northeast in a1750 e. it is difficult to determine whether the activity of the galaxies associated with a1750 e is triggered by a past interaction with a1750 c or not due to the small number of active galaxies .",
    "a1750 e may be also related to a1750 n. the galaxy number density map in fig .",
    "[ fig - sub](d ) shows that a1750 c is largely connected to a1750 n through a1750 e. to account for the velocity information in addition to the spatial distribution , we present the spatial distribution of cluster galaxies with measured velocities in fig .",
    "[ fig - vel ] .",
    "the radial velocity of southern part of a1750 e is similar to that of a1750 c , and that of northern part of a1750 e is similar to that of a1750 n.    a1750 n is suspected to experience no mergers in the past , but to be weakly interacting with other sources other than a1750 c now .",
    "this is consistent with the findings based on xmm - newton data by @xcite : ( 1 ) the x - ray image of a1750 n is elongated along the northeast direction ; ( 2 ) there is another extended x - ray source just to the north of a1750 n ; ( 3 ) the gas temperature of a1750 n is uniform ; and ( 4 ) the cooling flow is not disrupted in the core region of a1750 n. the distribution of galaxies in the number density and spatial - velocity maps ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - vel ] ) indicate that the current interaction / accretion of a1750 n may be related to a1750 e. in addition , if we plot the spatial distribution of the galaxies with @xmath9622,500 km s@xmath7 that might be another small group ( star symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig - vel ] ) , the spatial distribution of these galaxies is overlapped with the region connecting to a1750 n and a1750 e. in conclusion , a1750 e maybe a subcluster that was partially disrupted during the previous interaction with a1750 c and is currently interacting with a1750 n.      we could not find any ` e+a ' galaxies that have strong balmer absorption lines with no [ o ii ] emission line in either of a168 and a1750 . `",
    "e+a ' galaxies are usually regarded as post - starburst galaxies that have experienced starbursts within the last gyr , and the activity has been abruptly truncated . since they were first discovered in distant clusters @xcite and were found more in clusters than in the field @xcite , they were supposed to be cluster - related phenomena .",
    "however , the local ( @xmath97 ) ` e+a ' galaxies are rarely found in clusters @xcite , and are usually found in the low density environment such as poor groups and the field @xcite .",
    "therefore , their origin and relation with clusters are still debated @xcite .",
    "interestingly , some ` e+a ' galaxies are found in nearby merging clusters ( coma at @xmath98 ; @xcite , and a3921 at @xmath99 ; @xcite ) , but they do not appear to be related with the current merging event .",
    "however , in some cases , ` e+a ' galaxies are expected to exist in merging clusters if the increased ram - pressure of icm can trigger sf activity of cluster galaxies and subsequently quench it .",
    "we checked the equivalent width ( ew ) of h@xmath100 absorption lines for all galaxies in fig .",
    "[ fig - active ] .",
    "it is found that the maximum values of ew(h@xmath100 ) are just 1.15   in a168 and 1.17   in a1750 that are much smaller than the typical criterion ( 5 ) for ` e+a ' galaxies . in conclusion",
    ", the existence of galaxies with sf / agn activity and the lack of ` e+a ' galaxies in a168 , may indicate that the galaxy activity is induced by the cluster merger recently , and is not yet quenched . for a1750",
    ", the activity of galaxies associated with the merging between two major subclusters might be not yet triggered , since the merging is in the early stage .",
    "we present the results of a study of dynamical state for two merging binary clusters ( a168 and a1750 ) and the activity of cluster galaxies using the sdss galaxy sample of which redshifts are available in sdss or ned .",
    "our primary results are summarised below .    1 .",
    "we have found the substructures in each cluster , and have investigated the kinematic and photometric properties of the galaxies in the subclusters .",
    "2 .   using the two - body model analysis and the x - ray data , we have investigated the merger histories of a168 and a1750 . two subclusters in a168 appear to have experienced last encounter about @xmath91 @xmath5 gyr ago , and to be now coming together from the maximum expansion of @xmath92 @xmath5 mpc about @xmath82 @xmath5 gyr ago .",
    "two major subclusters ( a1750 c and n ) appear to have started interaction and to be coming together for the first time . 3 .",
    "we have found an excess of galaxies with sf / agn activity in the region between the two subclusters of a168 , which might have been triggered by the cluster merger .",
    "however , we found no enhanced concentration of blue galaxies at that region , which is consistent with the result in @xcite .",
    "4 .   in a1750",
    ", we could not find any galaxies that show strong activity in the region between two subclusters ( a1750 n and c ) , which is consistent with the scenario that they are in the early stage of merging .",
    "a1750 e may be a subcluster that was partially disrupted during the previous interaction with a1750 c and is currently interacting with a1750 n. 5 .   we found no ` e+a ' galaxies in either of a168 or a1750 .    in conclusion , the cluster merger appears to trigger the activity of cluster galaxies , and its effect is different depending on the merging stage .",
    "cluster mergers are usually in different stages , and the conditions of icm and galaxies in these clusters are diverse",
    ". therefore it is needed to study more clusters in different stages of merging to understand the relation between the galaxy activity and the dynamical state of the clusters .",
