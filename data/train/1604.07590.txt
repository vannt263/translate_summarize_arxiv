    "antiferromagnets ( afms ) have so far found little applications as active components of devices primarily due to their lack of net magnetization . with the development of spintronics",
    ", however , the net magnetization that couples strongly to the magnetic field becomes less important . in the latest generation of magnetic random access memories ( mrams ) , for example",
    ", magnetic fields are used neither for writing nor for reading .",
    "since afms possess a long range magnetic order just like ferromagnets ( fms ) , they have been recently explored as new materials for spintronics ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for recent reviews of antiferromagnetic spintronics ) .",
    "in particular , they could in principle be used for solid state memories in which bits of information are represented by the direction of the magnetic order parameter , similarly to fms .",
    "such memory functionalities were experimentally demonstrated in afm tunneling @xcite and ohmic devices @xcite .    compared to fms , afms",
    "have several potential advantages .",
    "they are insensitive to large magnetic fields and do not produce any stray fields .",
    "this makes them more challenging from an experimental and technological point of view , but it can also be an advantage . stray fields can cause problems in densely packed devices , and the sensitivity to external magnetic fields means that a fm memory can be accidentally rewritten by external magnetic fields .",
    "afm memory , on the other hand , is much less sensitive to external magnetic fields .",
    "for example , a memory based on ferh could not be erased by fields as high as 9 t @xcite .",
    "another advantage is that dynamics of magnetic moments in afms is much faster than in fms .",
    "switching of the afm order parameter on a ps timescale was demonstrated , e.g. , in a laser - induced heating experiment @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of afms is also the wide range of available afm materials .",
    "this holds especially for semiconductors .",
    "fm semiconductors have attracted a lot of interest in the past since they enable the combination of spintronic and microelectronic functionalities . yet , despite intensive research , fm semiconductors remain rare and tend to have curie temperatures too low for practical applications .",
    "afm semiconductors on the other hand are more common and tend to have magnetic order persisting above room temperature @xcite .",
    "materials that combine antiferromagnetism with ferroelectricity @xcite or the parent compounds of the high @xmath0 superconductors @xcite further highlight the broad and diverse range of afms .    for microelectronic memory and logic applications of afms",
    ", two basic functionalities have to be available : a method for detecting and manipulating electrically the magnetic order parameter . for readout , the anisotropic magnitoresistance ( amr ) effect @xcite and its tunneling counterpart tamr have been demonstrated @xcite . while amr is usually rather small , with typical magnetoresistance ratios around a few percent , a @xmath1 tamr has been already achieved , albeit at low temperatures .    manipulating the magnetic order parameter in afms by practical means has been a major challenge .",
    "afms can be controlled by external magnetic fields , but this is impractical since it typically requires very large fields .",
    "the lowest uniform static field that can reorient an afm is the so - called spin - flop field , which is proportional to @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the inter - sublattice exchange field and @xmath4 is the anisotropy field . since the exchange interaction is typically much larger than the anisotropy , the spin - flop fields are large compared to fms . instead",
    ", an auxiliary exchanged - coupled fm layer is often used @xcite , which makes manipulation possible by smaller fields .",
    "this only works for thin afm layers though , and it is highly dependent on interface properties .",
    "while fms can be manipulated by external magnetic fields , in microelectronic devices a direct electrical manipulation offers a more scalable approach .",
    "this is usually achieved using the so - called spin - transfer torque @xcite .",
    "this torque occurs due to the absorption of angular momentum from a spin - polarized current generated by a fixed fm polarizer . on the other hand , due to spin - orbit coupling",
    ", a torque can be generated without the injection of a spin - current from the fm polarizer @xcite .",
    "such torque is usually called a spin - orbit torque . in fms",
    "it requires a broken inversion symmetry and can therefore occur either in crystals with no inversion symmetry in the unit cell or in heterostructures , where inversion symmetry is broken structurally .",
    "because of the insensitivity of afms to external fields , the electrical manipulation of afms is even more desirable . to manipulate a collinear afm effectively , a staggered magnetic field ( i.e. , a field that is opposite on the two sublattices )",
    "is needed . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that the analogue of the fm spin - transfer torque in afms can generate effective fields that are staggered .",
    "however this requires very thin layers @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that in bulk afms with specific symmetries , electrical current can create a torque by a similar mechanism to the spin - orbit torque in fms .",
    "the work also showed that the effective field generating the torque can be staggered and the corresponding non - staggered torque can thus be effective for manipulating afms .",
    "switching of an afm based on predictions in ref .",
    "@xcite was recently experimentally observed in afm cumnas @xcite .",
    "this opens up a way to applications of afms .",
    "the current densities needed for switching in ref .",
    "@xcite were comparable to current densities in fm spin - torque mrams .",
    "in this manuscript we theoretically study the nature and characteristics of spin - orbit torques in afms in a systematic way .",
    "we give a general symmetry analysis for locally and globally non - centrosymmetric crystals and considering both the afm and fm order .",
    "we determine when the torque can exist , when it is effective for manipulating the magnetic order in afms , and also what form the torque has . in ref .",
    "@xcite the spin - orbit torque was calculated for two representative tight - binding models , one describing a three - dimensional ( 3d ) lattice of @xmath5 and the other one representing a two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystal with rashba spin - orbit coupling .",
    "@xmath5 served as a model afm system with globally centrosymmetric and locally non - centrosymmetric crystal structure and inversion - partner lattice sites occupied by the two spin - sublattices .",
    "in this model system , the so called field - like torque , driven by a staggered , magnetization - independent current - induced field , is effective .",
    "( note that the relevant crystal symmetries of @xmath5 are the same as those of the recently experimentally studied cumnas and that the calculated magnitudes of the spin - orbit torques in @xmath5 and cumnas are also comparable [ 7 ] . ) on the other hand , the so called ( anti)damping - like torque , driven by a staggered , magnetization - dependent effective field , was found to be the effective torque component in the 2d afm crystal with a global inversion asymmetry modeled by the rashba hamiltonian .    here",
    "we calculate all spin - orbit torque components in both models which allows us to generalize the result of ref .",
    "@xcite : all torque components driven by fields that are an even function of the sublattice magnetization are effective in the afm 3d @xmath5 model while torques driven by fields that are odd in magnetization are effective in the afm 2d rashba model .",
    "the calculations also reveal that the angular dependences of the current - induced fields with respect to the applied current direction and the direction of magnetic moments are similar in the two model systems , due to similarities in the relevant symmetries of the two model crystals .",
    "numerical and analytical calculations of the spin - orbit torque in the two tight - binding models are complemented by ab initio density - functional - theory ( dft ) calculations and results for the afm order are compared to calculations assuming the fm order in the same model crystals .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : models ] we describe the two tight - binding models and the linear response formalism used for calculating the spin - orbit torque . in sec .",
    "[ sec : symmetry ] we discuss the symmetry of the spin - orbit torque and apply the general symmetry arguments to our two models .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] we discuss the results , in particular summarize the symmetry considerations .",
    "in some materials electrical current can induce non - equilibrium spin - polarization due to spin - orbit coupling @xcite .",
    "this effect is called the inverse spin - galvanic effect or the edelstein effect . for the presence of",
    "non - vanishing net spin - polarization ( i.e. , integrated over the whole unit cell ) a broken inversion symmetry is needed . in fms , due to exchange interaction between carrier spins and magnetic moments , the current - induced spin - polarization ( cisp )",
    "will exert a torque on the magnetization .",
    "this effect is the spin - orbit torque . in afms",
    "the effect is similar . since the carrier ",
    "magnetic moment exchange interaction is short - range , spin - polarization generated by the electrical current on a sublattice will interact primarily with the magnetic moments on that sublattice . to evaluate the spin - orbit torque in afms we thus have to calculate the cisp locally on each magnetic sublattice .",
    "note that in the spintronics community two different effects are termed as the spin - orbit torque .",
    "apart from the effect discussed here , there exists also a torque generated in heavy metal / fm heterostructures due to spin hall effect .",
    "lateral electrical current generates spin current in the perpendicular direction due to the spin hall effect , which flows in the fm and exerts a torque via the spin - transfer torque mechanism . since the heterostructures have broken inversion symmetry , the torque due to inverse spin galvanic effect coexists with the spin hall torque , rendering the entire physics quite complex to analyze ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite , where both mechanisms are included ) .",

    "appendix : symmetry ] we give a derivation of the symmetry properties of the tensor @xmath12 . here",
    "we summarize the main results and apply them to our two models .",
    "the following analysis applies both to the effective field and the cisp because they have the same symmetry properties .",
    "since spin - orbit torque is a non - equilibrium process that includes dissipation , the tensor @xmath12 does not have a simple behavior under time - reversal . to deal with this problem we separate the tensor into a part even in magnetic moments and a part odd in magnetic moments @xmath62 ) = \\big[\\chi_a([\\mathbf{m } ] ) + \\chi_a([-\\mathbf{m}])\\big]/2,\\\\   \\chi_a^{\\text{odd}}(\\big[\\mathbf{m } ] ) = \\big[\\chi_a([\\mathbf{m } ] ) - \\chi_a([-\\mathbf{m}])\\big]/2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 = [ \\mathbf{m}_a,\\mathbf{m}_b,\\dots]$ ] denotes the directions of all magnetic moments in the magnetic unit cell .",
    "as shown in the appendix [ appendix : symmetry ] it holds that @xmath64 in appendix [ appendix : symmetry ] , the following rules are derived for the transformation of @xmath12 under symmetry operation @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the sublattice to which the sublattice @xmath7 transforms under symmetry operation @xmath65 and @xmath68 is a matrix representing the symmetry operation in real space as defined by eq . . the plus sign in eq",
    ". corresponds to a symmetry operation that does not contain time - reversal and the minus to a symmetry operation that contains time - reversal .",
    "these rules apply for any form of magnetic order as well as for nonmagnetic crystals .",
    "the same rules also apply for the tensor @xmath69 , which describes the net cisp .",
    "basic symmetry rules can be inferred from eqs . and .",
    "if the system has an inversion symmetry @xmath70 if also inversion transforms the sublattice @xmath7 into itself , then there can be no cisp on the sublattice @xmath7 .",
    "we therefore reach an important conclusion : for the existence of the cisp ( and thus also the spin - orbit torque ) on sublattice @xmath7 , the inversion symmetry has to be _ locally _ broken , i.e. , there must be no inversion center in the sublattice @xmath7 .",
    "this means that current can generate spin - polarization even in a material that has global inversion symmetry if inversion symmetry is broken locally .",
    "however , it is also important to note that if the inversion symmetry is locally broken , the cisp can still vanish due to other symmetries .",
    "for example , a diamond lattice has a global inversion symmetry , but the two different lattice sites in the diamond unit cell have inversion symmetry locally broken . without any strain ,",
    "the cisp will nevertheless vanish .",
    "however , when a uniaxial strain is present in the diamond lattice a cisp with opposite sign on the two different sites will appear @xcite .",
    "in the 2d rashba model , the inversion symmetry is broken globally due to the structural asymmetry of the assumed layered system . in the afm @xmath5 crystal ,",
    "the inversion symmetry is broken by the magnetic order since the inversion partner lattice sites are occupied by mn atoms with opposite moments . even without magnetic moments , however , the inversion symmetry is locally broken for each sublattice .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : structures](b ) and is discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : discussion ] ( see also fig . [",
    "fig : mn2au_inv ] ) .    of particular interest in the case of afms is to determine how the cisps on the afm spin - sublattices are related .",
    "this is because for the spin - orbit torque to be efficient , the current induced effective magnetic field and thus also the cisp have to be staggered .",
    "since the exchange interaction is much larger than any field typically acting on afms , we assume that during any dynamics the two magnetic moments stay approximately collinear ( although any dynamics of the afm order parameter induces a small magnetization ) . then in the afm 2d rashba model , a simultaneous translation and time - inversion will always be a symmetry of the model that transforms one afm spin - sublattice into the other .",
    "for such a symmetry operation , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the identity matrix , and therefore @xmath73 this implies that the efficient torque driven by a staggered field is generated by the odd component of the response tensor .    in the @xmath5 type of crystal ,",
    "the afm spin - sublattices are not connected by translation .",
    "instead they are connected by inversion around the unit cell center so that a combination of inversion and time - reversal is a symmetry of the model . since in this case @xmath74",
    ", we find @xmath75 and now it is the even component of the response tensor that generates the staggered cisp .",
    "the two models illustrate a general phenomenology of cisps in collinear afms , in which the two afm spin - sublattices are typically connected either by a translation or by an inversion .    by considering the magnetic space group of a given material",
    ", one can find using the eqs . and",
    "the most general form of the tensor @xmath12 as well as relations between tensors @xmath12 on different sublattices .",
    "note that for the cisp projected on a sublattice it is not enough to consider the point group of the crystal because then the information on the relationship between the sublattices would be lost .",
    "we provide a free program which outputs the symmetry of the cisp for any type of crystal and magnetic structure @xcite .",
    "see the appendix [ appendix : code ] for a brief description of the code .",
    "symmetry of the tensors , which describe the global spin - orbit torque can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite for every magnetic point group .",
    "these also apply for the local spin - orbit torque , if the local magnetic point group is used .    to describe the dependence of the cisp on the direction of magnetic moments , it is useful to expand the linear response tensor in powers of magnetic moments . in general",
    "@xmath12 depends on the directions of all magnetic moments in the system .",
    "we consider only fms and collinear two - sublattice afms .",
    "we again assume that the magnetic moments will always stay approximately collinear .",
    "since the intra - spin - sublattice exchange is typically very large , we also assume that the magnitude of the spin - sublattice magnetic moments will not change during dynamics .",
    "then @xmath12 will be a function of only the spin - axis direction @xmath76 .",
    "in the case of two sublattice collinear afm , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the nel vector : @xmath79 . in fms @xmath80 . we can then write the tensor @xmath12 in the following way , @xcite @xmath81 here the einstein summation notation is used . note that since @xmath76 is a unit vector , the expansion could be done using two variables only .",
    "we find it more practical , however , to use all three components of @xmath76 .",
    "the odd terms in the expansion correspond to the odd part of the cisp , while the even terms correspond to the even part .    to find the symmetry properties of the expansion we have to consider the nonmagnetic local point group .",
    "this is a group of symmetry operations of the nonmagnetic crystal that leave the sublattice @xmath7 invariant .",
    "( see the appendix [ appendix : symmetry ] for details on how to find the symmetry properties of the expansion . ) since there are only 21 nonmagnetic point groups with broken inversion symmetry , it is feasible to calculate all allowed leading terms of the expansion .",
    "this was done for the zeroth order terms in ref .",
    "@xcite that focused on the cisp in fms .",
    "the zeroth order terms generate the field - like torque . in table",
    "[ table : point_groups1 ] we give all allowed first order terms and for completeness we also show the zeroth order terms .",
    "the zeroth order term vanishes for several point groups . for those we also give the second order terms in table [ table : point_groups2 ] .",

    "the cartesian systems are defined in terms of the conventional basis vectors @xmath82 ( see the international tables for crystallography @xcite ) .",
    "the choice of the cartesian system is straightforward for the orthorhombic , tetragonal and cubic groups .",
    "the tensors for the triclinic group @xmath83 have a completely general form and the choice of the coordinate system is thus irrelevant for this group . for hexagonal and trigonal groups ,",
    "we choose the right - handed coordinate system that satisfies @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "for the monoclinic groups we use the unique axis @xmath86 setting @xcite and choose the right - handed coordinate system that satisfies @xmath84 , @xmath87 .",

    "the tensors apply for the local as well as for the net cisp . in the latter case",
    "the global point group has to be used .",
    "since the zeroth order term is independent of magnetic moments it can be equally considered for any material , including non - collinear afms . in nonmagnetic materials , there is naturally no dependence on magnetic moments so the zeroth order terms describes the cisp completely in this case .",
    "the zeroth order terms that generate the field - like torque are particularly important since they are often dominant . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the tensors corresponding to the field - like torque are in general composed of three distinct terms : generalized rashba and dresselhaus terms and a term describing a response proportional to the electric field .",

    "this is similar to the estimated value of @xmath233 used in the tight - binding calculation of the effective current induced field .",
    "the difference between tight - binding and dft calculations is therefore primarily in the cisps , which differ by a factor of @xmath234 .",
    "the remaining discrepancy between the tight - binding and dft effective fields is due to different magnetic moments in the two approaches .",
    "these differ because the tight - binding hamiltonian was fitted to a lda+u dft calculation , while for the torque calculation a dft calculation without u was used . including the hubbard u increases the moments by about 20% .",
    "the dft magnitude of the effective staggered field in @xmath5 is comparable to that of the cumnas afm where current induced switching has been recently observed in experiment @xcite .",
    "highly conductive @xmath5 is therefore a potentially favorable material for exploring and exploiting current induced spin - orbit torques is afms .",
    "we have presented a symmetry analysis of spin - orbit torques in afms and fms and discussed in detail results obtained in two complementary model systems with locally and globally broken inversion symmetry , respectively .",
    "we have pointed out that the existence and form of the spin - orbit torque on the given spin - sublattice is determined by the sublattice local symmetry .",
    "we have also shown that in afms , symmetry operations that connect the two spin - sublattices determine the relation between the spin - orbit torques on the two sublattices .",
    "our two models illustrate two main cases with the sublattices connected either by a translation or by an inversion .",
    "consequently , in the afm 2d rashba model representing the former case , the efficient component of the torque has an antidamping character , while in afm @xmath5 representing the latter case , the efficient spin - orbit torque has a field - like character .",

    "we give here an overview of the symmetry of spin - orbit torque .",
    "symmetry of transport coefficients in magnetic systems has been studied before , primarily in the context of electrical and heat conductivity @xcite , but also for the spin - orbit torque @xcite . here",
    "we expand the analysis to account for sublattice projections .",
    "we use the microscopic eqs .",
    ", , as a starting point .",
    "our approach is similar to that of @xcite where a more general version of kubo formula was used .",
    "the results do not depend on the exact form of the formulas : it is only important that the formulas describe linear response .",
    "additionally , the results apply only assuming a single - electron ( i.e. , non - interacting ) hamiltonian .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , there has been a considerable controversy surrounding the symmetry of tensors describing transport phenomena .",
    "the difficulty lies in understanding the effect of the time - reversal symmetry operation @xcite .",
    "this is because transport phenomena are non - equilibrium processes that include dissipation .",
    "we define a time - reversal operator as @xmath235 , where @xmath236 is the complex conjugation .",
    "this is how the time reversal operator is conventionally defined in quantum mechanics .",
    "note that such defined time - reversal operator reverses direction of magnetic moments , but does not in general reverse direction of electrical currents ( see the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath65 be a symmetry of the hamiltonian , i.e. , @xmath237 symmetry operations that do not contain time - reversal are represented by a unitary @xmath65 .",
    "symmetry operations that contain time - reversal are represented by antiunitary @xmath65 since @xmath236 is an antiunitary operator .",
    "if @xmath238 is an eigenfunction of the hamiltonian , then @xmath239 is also an eigenfunction with the same eigenvalue .",
    "since the result can not depend on the choice of eigenfunctions , we can use the transformed eigenfunctions to evaluate the cisp .",
    "the transformed eigenfunction correspond to a different @xmath57-point , but the sums will always run over all @xmath57-points",
    ". the only part of the microscopic equations that depends on the eigenfunctions are the matrix elements , the rest depends only on the eigenvalues .",
    "transformation of the matrix elements depends on whether @xmath65 is a unitary operator or an antiunitary operator . for unitary @xmath65 and an observable @xmath240 @xmath241 while for antiunitary @xmath65 @xmath242 we represent the transformation of operators @xmath243 and @xmath19 by 3x3 matrices @xmath244 , @xmath245 @xmath246 where @xmath67 is the sublattice in which @xmath7 transforms under @xmath65 .",

    "since both @xmath243 and @xmath19 anticommute with time - reversal and since @xmath60 , @xmath249 contain the real part of the matrix elements , while @xmath59 contains the imaginary part of the matrix elements @xmath64 we find for the transformation of each part under antiunitary @xmath65 @xmath250 we now show how to express the matrices @xmath251 .",
    "let @xmath68 be a @xmath252 matrix that represents how a point transforms under @xmath65 @xmath253 the shift @xmath254 is due to translations .",
    "it is irrelevant for matrices @xmath251 , but the translations can not be ignored altogether because they influence which sublattice @xmath7 transforms to .",
    "note that the time - reversal symmetry operation does not influence the matrix @xmath68 either since it only affects the magnetic moments .",

    "tensor @xmath12 would not satisfy @xmath261 since in a non - cartesian coordinate system @xmath262 .",
    "while , it is natural to express the tensors @xmath69 in a cartesian coordinate systems , the symmetry operations are usually expressed in the conventional coordinate systems , which for the case of monoclinic , hexagonal and trigonal groups are not cartesian . for completeness",
    "we provide here a generalization to non - cartesian systems .",

    "we first consider a unitary symmetry operation @xmath65 .",
    "using the eq . , which holds in the cartesian system @xmath267 in a cartesian system , @xmath68 has to be orthogonal , so @xmath268 . since @xmath269 and @xmath270 , we find @xmath271 analogously",
    ", we find for antiunitary @xmath65 @xmath272 these formulas determine how @xmath69 transforms in any coordinate system .",
    "this result is quite general and holds for any linear response formula .",
    "one just has to replace the matrices @xmath244 , @xmath245 by matrices that describe transformation of the corresponding operators .",

    "@xcite , except that we separate the tensor into the even and odd parts .",

    "applies also for the expansion of the net cisp , if the global point group is used instead . in afms",
    ", the net tensor @xmath69 transforms in general differently .",
    "this is because a symmetry operation that transforms one sublattice into the other can reverse the sign of the nel vector and this is not taken into account in eq . .",
    "for example in @xmath5 , inversion is a symmetry of the nonmagnetic crystal . as a consequence , the net cisp in the fm @xmath5 vanishes as correctly predicted by eq . applied for the net cisp . in afm",

    "spin - axis direction is not enough to describe the magnetic state of the afm .",
    "then the expansion should be performed in more parameters than just @xmath76 . however , if we assume that all the other parameters are fixed during dynamics then expansion can still be used and eq .",
    "we provide a code that can analyze the symmetry of spin - orbit torque in a given crystal structure automatically @xcite . it can find the symmetry restricted form of a tensor @xmath12 and also of the expansion . here , we give a brief overview of the code .",

    "we first choose the ones which form the local point group , i.e. , the symmetry operations that leave the selected sublattice invariant .",
