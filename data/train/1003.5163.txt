    "these form the 1lac catalogue . considering the 796 sources in the 1lac associated with a single counterpart",
    ", there are 37 sources generically classified as agn , 314 bl lac and 285 flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , classified according to their optical spectrum .",
    "the remaining 160 sources are candidate blazars but of  unknown \" class because of lacking an optical spectrum or , if available , because of its poor quality for the optical classification . however , for these sources a counterpart could still be found in one of the radio catalogues adopted for the source identification by a10a ( crates  haeley et al . 2007 ; cgrabs  healey et al .",
    "2008 ; the bzcat  massaro et al",
    "thirty five sources in the 1lac sample have more than one associated counterpart .    the 1fgl sample is equally populated in the northern ( 713 sources ) and southern sky ( 738 sources ) .",

    "the recently published australia telescope 20 ghz survey ( at20 g , murphy at al .",
    "2010 ) represents the largest catalogue of high frequency radio sources detected with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) in a survey conducted from 2004 to 2008 and covering the whole sky south of declination 0@xmath8 .",
    "it contains 5890 radio sources with flux at 20 ghz exceeding 40 mjy and it is complete at a level of 91% above 100 mjy beam@xmath9 . for several sources the fluxes at 8 and 5 ghz are also measured .",
    "the at20 g survey , being conducted at relatively high radio frequencies ( 20 ghz ) , most likely detects the radio emission from the compact cores of agn .",
    "several sources in this survey have flat or inverted radio spectra between 5 and 20 ghz .",
    "we correlate the at20 g radio catalogue with the 1fgl in search for possible counterparts .",
    "this allows us to study the radio versus @xmath2ray properties of these associations .",
    "a possible correlation between the radio and the @xmath2ray emission in radio loud agn can shed light on the physical link between the emission processes in these two energy bands .",
    "the @xmath10 spectra of both fsrq and bl lac objects show two peaks which are widely interpreted as due to the synchrotron and inverse compton emission , respectively .",
    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of blazars form a sequence ( so  called  blazar sequence \" , e.g. fossati et al .",
    "1998 ) with the most powerful sources ( fsrqs ) having the synchrotron and inverse compton peaks in the ir and mev energy range respectively , while the less powerful bl lacs have the synchrotron and inverse compton peak in the optical / uv ( or even x  ray ) and gev  tev energy range respectively .",
    "the blazar sequence was built by dividing blazars into bins of radio luminosity , thought to be a proxy for the bolometric one , and establishes a link between the radio and the @xmath2ray emission . before",

    "taylor et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , by studying the radio properties of egret detected blazars with the vlba imaging and polarimetry survey ( vips  extending down to 85 mjy ) found that at low radio fluxes the radio flux density does not directly correlate with the @xmath2ray flux . further investigation of this correlation was possible with the source list of the  first three months survey ( lbas , abdo et al .",
    "2009 ; giroletti et al . 2010 ) : while a correlation between the radio flux at 8.4 ghz and the peak flux ( above 100 mev ) appears when considering bl lacs and fsrq together , the statistical evidence is only marginal for fsrqs ( chance correlation probability of 8% ) , being more robust only for bl lacs ( 0.5% ) .",
    "such correlation analysis should consider the different redshift range spanned by these two populations ( e.g. mucke et al .",
    "abdo et al . (",
    "2009 ) found a separation in the @xmath2ray spectral index versus radio luminosity among fsrqs , bl lacs and misaligned agn which suggests that more luminous radio sources have softer @xmath2ray spectra .",
    "recent studies of the radio@xmath2 flux correlation in the lbas sources ( kovalev et al .",

    "we search for the possible counterparts of the   1fgl sample in the at20 g survey (  1 ) . by intersecting the association results with the 1lac sample we study the radio vs @xmath2ray properties of these associations (  2 ) .",

    "2009 , 2010 , 2010a ) relies on positional coincidence ( sutherland & saunders 1992 ) and it is based on bayes statistics . to each association between a  source and a candidate counterpart it is assigned a posterior probability based on the counterparts space density around the  source . only those associations with a posterior probability larger than a chosen value are considered as likely associations . considering only high latitude sources ( @xmath11 ) the 1lac sample ( abdo et al .",

    "the association method searches for single radio sources falling within the confidence ellipse of the  sources .",
    "we applied this method in cross correlating the at20 g survey catalogue with the 1fgl one . similarly to the 1lac sample we accept only single associations ( i.e. only one radio counterpart falls within the the  source error ellipse ) and with a posterior probability @xmath680% .      to compute the posterior probability we have to assign the prior probability to the at20 g sample .",
    "this represents the confidence that the at20 g catalogue contains the real counterparts of the  sources .",
    "we compute the prior probability of the at20 g catalogue following the procedure described in appendix c of a10 .",
    "the prior probability represents the probability of finding a number of false identification from the correlation of the 1fgl and at20 g real catalogues which is equal to the average number of associations found by the cross correlation of the at20 g sample with randomly generated catalogues of  sources . to this aim we created a set of 100  fake catalogues by displacing the sources between 2 and 10 degrees from their real positions . for sources near the galactic plane a smaller displacement in galactic latitude",
    "was adopted ( eq .",
    "c3 of appendix 2 of a10 ) .",
    "we then computed the number of false associations between the at20 g and 1fgl as a function of the prior probability assigned to the at20 g catalogue ( dashed line in fig .",

    "2009 ; giroletti et al . 2010 ) showed that there is a possible correlation between the 8.4 ghz radio flux and the @xmath2ray flux .",
    "however , this correlation was found to be statistically significant ( chance probability of 0.05% ) only for the population of bl lacs , while fsrq showed only a marginal correlation ( with a chance probability of 8% ) . without separating the source types , kovalev ( 2009 ; 2009a )",
