    "in order to characterize our transfer function , we measure rabi oscillations of the spin signal under microwave pulses across a set of offset frequencies . by numerically fitting the measured oscillations to a theoretical model , the amplitude and phase of the transfer function are obtained .",
    "first , we consider the hamiltonian of the single - qubit system in the lab frame : @xmath128 where @xmath129 is the zeeman interaction between the electron spin and the static magnetic field and @xmath130 is the interaction between the electron spin and the microwave field .",
    "using the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , the hamiltonian in the rotating frame with frequency @xmath131 has the following form : @xmath132 where @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and @xmath135 are the offset frequency , amplitude , and phase of the microwave pulse , respectively .",
    "here , we consider a constant @xmath134 for simplicity which means the microwave pulse has a single frequency component @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath136 and @xmath137 are always referred to as in - phase part ( denoted as @xmath138 ) and quadrature part ( denoted as @xmath139 ) .",
    "this allows the waveform to be conveniently written in a complex form of @xmath140 .",
    "distortion caused by the finite bandwidth of the resonator and imperfections in microwave generation and transmission makes @xmath141 different from the intended waveform @xmath142 .",
    "the ratio @xmath143 is the value of the transfer function @xmath67 at offset frequency @xmath144 .",
    "therefore , @xmath67 can be obtained by measuring @xmath143 at different offset frequencies .",
    "equation ( [ rotateh ] ) shows that in the rotating frame with frequency @xmath131 , the spin polarization is rotating at the frequency @xmath145 around the axis @xmath146 ( fig .",
    "[ sphere ] ) .",
    "the initial state of @xmath87 evolves as : @xmath147 where @xmath148 and @xmath149 . in our experiments , it is more convenient to work in the rotating frame of frequency @xmath150 , where the evolution of expectation values @xmath151 and @xmath152 can be expressed as : @xmath153 we applied constant amplitude pulses at frequency @xmath131 and fitted the experimental oscillations of @xmath151 and @xmath152 to eqs .",

    ", we can obtain estimates of @xmath143 at different frequencies .",
    "there are two issues of the method described above that need to be addressed .",
    "first , the method assumes the input microwave pulse with constant amplitude and single frequency component @xmath131 .",
    "however , in real systems the pulses will have a rising and falling at the beginning and end , during which the spin experiences varying microwave field . if the rising and falling time is very short compared to the total pulse length , the effect can be neglected to a good approximation . in our system , due to the finite bandwidth of the resonator as well as limitations in the transmission components ( _ e.g. _ , iq mixer and amplifier ) ,",
    "the rising and falling time of a pulse is around 5@xmath11410 ns , which is non - negligible for short pulses . to reduce the effect of the rising and falling of the pulse , we used relatively long pulses ( > 120 ns ) . by fitting rabi oscillations",
    "assuming the pulses are perfect pulses with constant amplitude , we obtained an initial guess for the transfer function ( denoted as @xmath154 ) . in the next fitting iteration , we simulated the rabi oscillations due to the pulses distorted by @xmath154 . in this way",
    ", we minimize the effect of imperfect pulses and obtained a refined transfer function .",
    "another issue is that the fitting results of the phase part of the transfer function , @xmath155 , strongly depend on the choice of the starting time point @xmath156 . from eq .",
    "( [ hamiltonian ] ) , it is not difficult to prove that with a temporal shift @xmath157 relative to @xmath156 , @xmath155 will get an additional slope which is @xmath158 . due to the distortion of the pulses , there is uncertainty in determining @xmath156 . to compensate , we used the refined fitting result of the transfer function as an initial guess to modify our optimal control ( oc ) pulses and measured the average gate fidelity using randomized benchmarking ( rb ) .",
    "we then performed a few iterations of feed - back control where we slightly adjusted the slope of the phase of the transfer function ( and our oc pulses accordingly ) until we maximized our average gate fidelity and got the measured transfer function @xmath72 as shown in fig .",
    "[ transfer ] .",
    "the gate set tomography ( gst ) results of unmodified oc pulses , the oc pulses modified by @xmath72 , and the oc pulses modified by @xmath159 are given in table [ gst ] .",
    "the table clearly shows both the amplitude and phase of the transfer function are important in improving the fidelities of the oc pulses .",
    "it should be noted that @xmath72 becomes inaccurate when the offset frequency @xmath144 is large , as the fitting of the experimental rabi oscillations is less sensitive to the microwave pulse amplitude and phase when @xmath160 is small .",
    "however , because the excitation bandwidths of our oc pulses are about 100 mhz or less , the imperfections of @xmath72 for @xmath161 larger than the bandwidths does not affect the controls of the oc pulses significantly . from the experimental results shown in the main text and the results listed in table [ gst ] , correcting the oc pulses using @xmath72 obtained by the method described above improves the control fidelities greatly .",

    "next the pulses enter the microwave resonator located at the center of the water - cooled electromagnet through a series of attenuator ( advanced technical materials ) and amplifiers ( pre - amplifier : miteq ; pulsed traveling wave tube amplifier : applied system engineering ) to achieve appropriate amplifications , followed by circulators ( ditom ) to minimize unwanted reflections .",
