    "the three - nucleon system is a useful tool for investigating our understanding of the nuclear force .",
    "since it is possible to obtain accurate numerical solutions for the three - body system , detailed comparisons of the model hamiltonian with the experimental data can be performed .",
    "these comparisons provide stringent tests of the two - body interactions obtained by fitting the two - body data , and give a means of studying the three - nucleon force .",
    "accurate bound - state calculations @xcite have shown that realistic two - body interactions yield binding energies for the triton and @xmath0 that are less than the experimental values , and one must add a three - body interaction to obtain the correct value .",
    "the bound - state system unfortunately provides limited information about the three - body force .",
    "most of the bound - state properties scale with the binding energy @xcite .",
    "that is , different interactions that give the same trinucleon binding energy predict nearly the same charge radii , asymptotic normalization constants , magnetic moments , etc .",
    "initially it was believed that the nucleon - deuteron scattering problem offered an opportunity to explore our understanding of the three - nucleon force ; however , it has been shown @xcite that most of the scattering data can be reproduced at a good level with only two - body interactions .",
    "for low - energy scattering the effects of the three - nucleon force are usually small ; there are nevertheless some discrepancies ( such as the nucleon analyzing power @xmath1 and the deuteron analyzing power @xmath2 ) that could be sensitive to these interactions .",
    "since much of the experimental data is for _ p - d _ scattering at low energies , where the coulomb interaction can not be neglected , it is necessary to solve the scattering equations for this case as well as for the _ n - d _ case .",
    "the pisa group @xcite has shown that it is possible to obtain accurate solutions for the _ p - d _ scattering equations using the pair - correlated hyperspherical harmonic ( phh ) basis to expand the wave function , and solving for the s - matrix by using the complex form of the kohn variational principle . in this paper",
    "we describe an alternate method for solving the configuration - space equations . while the method is similar to the one used in our previous calculations of the scattering length @xcite , a new iterative technique for solving the large matrix equations",
    "is presented .",
    "in addition to demonstrating the convergence and accuracy of this technique , we provide a detailed study of the number of angular - momentum and spin - isospin states required to obtain an accurate solution .",
    "since the question of how large a matching radius is required in configuration space to obtain an accurate solution has been a concern about this method , we also investigate the convergence of the method as a function of this parameter .",
    "while the present work is limited to scattering below the three - body breakup threshold , the method can be extended to higher energies using the boundary conditions discussed in ref .",
