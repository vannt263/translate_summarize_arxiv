    "in this paper we conduct a detailed study of the assouad dimension and the lower dimension ( sometimes referred to as the _ minimal dimensional number _ , _ lower assouad dimension _ or _ uniformity dimension _ ) .",
    "in particular , we investigate to what extent these dimensions are useful tools for studying the homogeneity of fractal sets . roughly speaking",
    ", the assouad dimension depends only on the most complex part of the set and the lower dimension depends only on the least complex part of the set . as such they give coarse ,",
    "easily interpreted , geometric information about the extreme behaviour of the local geometry of the set and their relationship with each other and the hausdorff , box and packing dimensions , helps paint a complete picture of the local scaling laws .",
    "we begin with a thorough investigation of the basic properties of the assouad and lower dimensions , for example , how they behave under products and the set theoretic complexity of the assouad and lower dimensions as maps on spaces of compact sets .",
    "we then compute the assouad and lower dimensions for a wide variety of sets , including the quasi - self - similar sets of falconer and mclaughlin @xcite and the self - affine carpets of baraski @xcite and lalley - gatzouras @xcite .",
    "we also provide an example of a self - similar set with overlaps which has distinct upper box dimension and assouad dimension , thus answering a question posed by olsen ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question 1.3 ) . in section [ questions ]",
    "we discuss our results and pose several open questions .",
    "all of our proofs are given in sections [ proofs1][proofs3 ] .",
    "+   + we use various different techniques to compute the assouad and lower dimensions .",
    "in particular , to calculate the dimensions of self - affine carpets we use a combination of delicate covering arguments and the construction of appropriate ` tangents ' .",
    "we use the notion of _ weak tangents _ used by mackay and tyson @xcite and _ very weak tangents _ , a concept we introduce here specifically designed to estimate the lower dimension .",
    "the assouad dimension was introduced by assouad in the 1970s @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "let @xmath0 be a metric space and for any non - empty subset @xmath1 and @xmath2 , let @xmath3 be the smallest number of open sets with diameter less than or equal to @xmath4 required to cover @xmath5 .",
    "the _ assouad dimension _ of a non - empty subset @xmath5 of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , is defined by @xmath8 although interesting in its own right , the importance of the assouad dimension thus far has been its relationship with quasi - conformal mappings and embeddability problems , rather than as a tool in the dimension theory of fractals , see @xcite .",
    "however , this seems to be changing , with several recent papers appearing which study assouad dimension and its relationship with the other well - studied notions of dimension : hausdorff , packing and box dimension ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "we will denote the hausdorff , packing and lower and upper box dimensions by @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 , respectively , and if the upper and lower box dimensions are equal then we refer to the common value as the box dimension and denote it by @xmath13 .",
    "we will also write @xmath14 for the @xmath15-dimensional hausdorff measure for @xmath16 . for",
    "a review of these other notions of dimension and measure , see @xcite .",
    "we will also be concerned with the natural dual to assouad dimension , which we call the _",
    "lower dimension_. the lower dimension of @xmath6 , @xmath17 , is defined by @xmath18    this quantity was introduced by larman @xcite , where it was called the _ minimal dimensional number _ , but it has been referred to by other names , for example : the _ lower assouad dimension _ by kenmki , lehrbck and vuorinen @xcite and the _ uniformity dimension _ ( tuomas sahlsten , personal communication ) .",
    "we decided on _ lower dimension _ to be consistent with the terminology used by bylund and gudayol in @xcite , but we wish to emphasise the relationship with the well - studied and popular assouad dimension .",
    "indeed , the assouad dimension and the lower dimension often behave as a pair , with many of their properties being intertwined .",
    "the lower dimension has received little attention in the literature on fractals , however , we believe it is a very natural definition and should have a place in the study of dimension theory and fractal geometry .",
    "we summarise the key reasons for this below :    * the lower dimension is a natural dual to the well - studied assouad dimension and dimensions often come in pairs .",
    "for example , the rich and complex interplay between hausdorff dimension and packing dimension has become one of the key concepts in dimension theory . also , the popular upper and lower box dimensions are a natural ` dimension pair ' .",
    "dimension pairs are important in several areas of geometric measure theory , for example , the dimension theory of product spaces , see theorem [ lowerassproduct ] and the discussion preceding it .",
    "* the lower dimension gives some important and easily interpreted information about the fine structure of the set .",
    "in particular , it identifies the parts of the set which are easiest to cover and gives a rigorous gauge on how efficiently the set can be covered in these areas .",
    "* one might argue that the lower dimension is not a sensible tool for studying sets which are highly inhomogeneous in the sense of having some exceptional points around which the set is distributed very sparsely compared to the rest of the set .",
    "for example , sets with isolated points have lower dimension equal to zero . however , it is perfect for studying attractors of iterated function systems ( ifss ) as the ifs construction forces the set to have a certain degree of homogeneity .",
    "in fact the difference between the assouad dimension and the lower dimension can give insight into the amount of homogeneity present .",
    "for example , for self - similar sets satisfying the open set condition , the two quantities are equal indicating that the set is as homogeneous as possible .",
    "however , in this paper we will demonstrate that for more complicated _ self - affine sets _ and _ self - similar sets with overlaps _ , the quantities can be , and often are , different .    for a totally bounded subset @xmath5 of a metric space",
    ", we have @xmath19 the lower dimension is in general not comparable to the hausdorff dimension or packing dimension . however , if @xmath5 is compact , then @xmath20 this was proved by larman @xcite . in particular , this means that the lower dimension provides a practical way of estimating the hausdorff dimension of compact sets from below , which is often a difficult problem .",
    "the assouad dimension and lower dimensions are much more sensitive to the local structure of the set around particular points , whereas the other dimensions give more global information .",
    "the assouad dimension will be ` large ' relative to the other dimensions if there are points around which the set is ` abnormally difficult ' to cover and the lower dimension will be ` small ' relative to the other dimensions if there are points around which the set is ` abnormally easy ' to cover .",
    "this phenomena is best illustrated by an example .",
    ". then @xmath22 @xmath23 and @xmath24 the lower dimension is zero due to the influence of the isolated points in @xmath6 .",
    "indeed the set is locally very easy to cover around isolated points and it follows that if a set , @xmath6 , has any isolated points , then @xmath25 .",
    "this could be viewed as an undesirable property for a ` dimension ' to have because it causes it to be non - monotone and means that it can increase under lipschitz mappings .",
    "we are not worried by this , however , as the geometric interpretation is clear and useful .",
    "for some basic properties of the assouad dimension , the reader is referred to the appendix of @xcite and for some more discussion of the basic properties of the assouad and lower dimension , see section [ app ] of this paper .",
    "+   + it is sometimes useful to note that we can replace @xmath26 in the definition of the assouad and lower dimensions with any of the standard covering or packing functions , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3.1 ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath5 is a subset of euclidean space , then @xmath27 could denote the number of squares in an @xmath4-mesh orientated at the origin which intersect @xmath5 or the maximum number of sets in an @xmath4-packing of @xmath5 .",
    "we also obtain equivalent definitions if the ball @xmath28 is taken to be open or closed , although we usually think of it as being closed .",
    "since bedford - mcmullen carpets were introduced in the mid 80s @xcite , there has been an enormous interest in investigating these sets as well as several generalisations .",
    "particular attention has been paid to computing the dimensions of an array of different classes of self - affine carpets , see @xcite .",
    "one reason that these classes are of interest is that they provide examples of self - affine sets with distinct hausdorff and packing dimensions . +   + recently , mackay @xcite computed the assouad dimension for the lalley - gatzouras class , see @xcite , which contains the bedford - mcmullen class . in this paper",
    "we will compute the assouad dimension and lower dimension for the baraski class , see @xcite , which also contains the bedford - mcmullen class , and we will complement mackay s result by computing the lower dimension for the lalley - gatzouras class . we will now briefly recall the definitions .",
    "+   + both classes consist of self - affine attractors of finite contractive iterated function systems acting on the unit square @xmath29 ^ 2 $ ] . recall that an iterated function system ( ifs ) is a finite collection of contracting self - maps on a metric space and the attractor of such an ifs , @xmath30 , is the unique non - empty compact set , @xmath5 , satisfying @xmath31 an important class of ifss is when the mappings are translate linear and act on euclidean space .",
    "in such cirmumstances , the attractor is called a self - affine set .",
    "these sets have attracted a substantial amount of attention in the literature over the past 30 years and are generally considered to be significantly more difficult to deal with than self - similar sets , where the mappings are assumed to be similarities . +   + * lalley - gatzouras and extended lalley - gatzouras carpets : * take the unit square and divide it up into columns via a finite positive number of vertical lines .",
    "now divide each column up independently by slicing horizontally . finally select a subset of the small rectangles , with the only restriction being that the length of the base must be strictly greater than the height , and for each chosen subrectangle include a map in the ifs which maps the unit square onto the rectangle via an orientation preserving linear contraction and a translation .",
    "the hausdorff and box - counting dimensions of the attractors of such systems were computed in @xcite and the assouad dimension was computed in @xcite . if we relax the requirement that ` the length of the base must be strictly greater than the height ' to ` the length of the base must be greater than or equal the height ' , then we obtain a slightly more general class , which we will refer to as the _ extended lalley - gatzouras class_.        * baraski carpets : * again take the unit square , but this time divide it up into a collection of subrectangles by slicing horizontally and vertically a finite number of times ( at least once in each direction ) .",
    "now take a subset of the subrectangles formed and form an ifs as above .",
    "the key difference between the baraski and lalley - gatzouras classes is that in the baraski class the largest contraction need not be in the vertical direction .",
    "this makes the baraski class significantly more difficult to deal with .",
    "the hausdorff and box - counting dimensions of the attractors of such systems were computed in @xcite .",
    "note that neither class is more general than the other .",
    "more general classes , containing both the lalley - gatzouras and baraski classes have been introduced and studied by feng and wang @xcite and the author @xcite .",
    "we split this section into three parts , where we study : basic properties ; quasi - self - similar sets ; and self - affine sets , respectively .      in this section",
    "we collect together some basic results concerning the assouad and lower dimensions",
    ". we will be interested in how they behave under some standard set operations : unions , products and closures .",
    "the behaviour of the classical dimensions under these operations has been long known , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapters 34 ) .",
    "we also give a simple example which demonstrates that the lower dimension of an open set in @xmath32 need not be @xmath33 .",
    "this is in stark contrast to the rest of the dimensions .",
    "finally , we will investigate the measurability of the assouad and lower dimensions .",

    "as before , writing @xmath568 and @xmath713 we have @xmath714 at this point in the proof of the upper bound in theorem [ uppermain ] , we iterated the ifs @xmath117 within each of the sets @xmath715 to decompose @xmath5 into small ` rectangular parts ' with smallest side comparable to @xmath4 .",
    "if we proceed in this way here , then the ` third term ' causes problems .",

    "this problem does not occur in the proof of the upper bound in theorem [ uppermain ] as the term @xmath718 _ can _ be bounded from _",
    "above_. this was a surprising and interesting complication . to overcome this we need to engineer it so that the third term disappears . as such we will iterate only using maps @xmath719 which have @xmath720 .",
    "fortunately we are able to do this by introducing a new ifs @xmath721 with the properties outlined in the following lemma .",
    "* @xmath721 is of horizontal type , i.e. , @xmath723 for all @xmath724 , * @xmath721 is a subset of some stopping @xmath708 created from the original ifs @xmath117 , * @xmath725 is a subset of @xmath5 and is such that @xmath726 .",
    "let @xmath100 be any @xmath734 closed square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes and let @xmath735 observe that each of the sets @xmath736 and @xmath737 inside the above unions lies in a rectangle whose smallest side is of length at least @xmath738 and the interiors of these rectangles are pairwise disjoint .",
    "it follows from this that @xmath100 can intersect no more than @xmath739 of the sets @xmath736 and @xmath737 .",
    "whence , using the @xmath4-grid definition of @xmath26 , @xmath740      for the second term we have @xmath742 by lemma [ dadbadditive ] and the fact that @xmath743 . combining the estimates for the two terms introduced above yields @xmath744 where @xmath745 observe that @xmath531 is a @xmath558-pseudo stopping and so by lemma [ selfsim ] we have @xmath746 which yields @xmath747 it follows that @xmath748 and letting @xmath411 completes the proof .",

    "we will rely on some results from @xcite , which technically speaking were not proved in the extended lalley - gatzouras case .",

    "let @xmath5 be a self - affine attractor of an ifs @xmath117 in the horizontal class and assume that @xmath750 .",
    "it follows from theorems [ uppermain ] and [ lowermain ] that @xmath751 which means that we do not have _ uniform vertical fibres _ and it follows from @xcite that @xmath752 .",
    "we will now show that @xmath753 .",
    "we will use the formula for the hausdorff dimension given in @xcite and so we must briefly introduce some notation .",

    "for the @xmath755th rectangle in the @xmath528th column write @xmath756 for the length of the base and @xmath757 for the height .",
    "notice that the length of the base depends only on which column we are in .",
    "then the hausdorff dimension of @xmath5 is given by @xmath758 where the maximum is taken over all associated probability distributions @xmath759 on the set @xmath760 and @xmath761 .",

    "it follows from the above argument and theorems [ uppermain ] and [ lowermain ] that @xmath769 it remains to show that @xmath770 .",
    "however , this follows from a dual argument observing that the box dimension of @xmath5 is given by the unique solution @xmath15 of @xmath771 ( see @xcite for the basic case or @xcite for the extended case ) and so we may continuously _ increase _ the @xmath757 independently ( while keeping @xmath772 ) and , if necessary , add new maps in to certain columns , to form a new construction @xmath773 with uniform vertical fibres and such that @xmath774      let @xmath5 be in the mixed class . the result for the horizontal and vertical classes follows from corollary [ intcor1 ] .",
    "suppose @xmath5 is such that @xmath775 .",

    "we remark here that the key reason that a symmetric argument can not be used to show that if @xmath781 , then @xmath782 , is that @xmath781 only implies that @xmath783 for all @xmath777 and @xmath125 .",
