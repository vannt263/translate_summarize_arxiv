    "<S> we now discuss the mechanism of these trends of dna behavior in droplets by considering the free energy of dna . </S>",
    "<S> first , we focus on the adsorption transition of coiled dna onto the membrane with an increase in the droplet size . the adsorption transition would be determined by the competition between the gain of free energy due to the adsorption of dna on the membrane and the loss of free energy due to the change in the translational and conformational entropy of dna upon moving from three- to two - dimensional space . </S>",
    "<S> the change in free energy per molecule is given as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the change in the conformational entropy of dna , @xmath16 is the adsorption energy of dna , @xmath17 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath18 is temperature , @xmath19 is the size of dna in three - dimensional space , @xmath20 is the size of dna in two - dimensional space , and @xmath6 is the radius of the droplet ( r @xmath21 @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) . the first term of eq.(1 ) is the change in translational entropy of dna from three- to two - dimensional space , which is a logarithmically increasing function of @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath22 would be an increasing function of @xmath6 , since @xmath23 deceases with @xmath6 and @xmath15 is independent of @xmath6 . to consider @xmath16 in detail , we studied dna adsorption on a membrane mediated by spd .    </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that a trivalent positively charged ion such as spd is markedly absorbed on negatively - charged molecules , and this is referred to as counterion condensation@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> spd mediates the attraction between dna segments that causes dna to transition into a globular structure @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the zeta potential of the dopc membrane with 10 mm monovalent ions was measured to be -13.4 mv @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , both dna and the dopc membrane should be absorbed by spd and they have an attractive electrostatic interaction . </S>",
    "<S> dna molecules possess a negative bare charge ( ca . </S>",
    "<S> 600 per kuhn length with effective ionic dissociation @xmath24 10 % ) , and this charge is reduced by approximately 90% with spd in solution due to counterion condensation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the quantity of spd needed to neutralize the bare charges of all dna in a droplet by 90% is approximately two orders of magnitude less than the entire quantity of spd . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the quantity of spd for dna neutralization is negligible small compared with the total quantity . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the bare negative charge of the membrane would be partly neutralized by spd in solution .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we now consider the adsorption equilibrium of spd on the membrane . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath25 spd of the entire quantity , @xmath26 , in the droplet is adsorbed on the membrane with an energy gain of @xmath10 ( see fig.4(a ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the total free energy is generally described using the flory - huggins model as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the number of lattice cells on the surface and in the bulk , respectively . with @xmath6 and the lattice cell length , @xmath30 , </S>",
    "<S> corresponding to the molecular length of spd , @xmath28 and @xmath29 can be written as follows : @xmath31 and @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the volume fractions of spd on the surface and in the bulk , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the number of adsorbed spd molecules at thermal equilibrium per lattice cell , @xmath35 , is obtained by minimizing @xmath36 with respect to @xmath25 as follows : @xmath37 where we have assumed the relation @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> figure 4(b ) shows the dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath6 for different values of @xmath39 used in the experiment and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> although @xmath35 is almost constant under the condition that @xmath10 is small ( several @xmath11 ) , @xmath35 is an increasing function of @xmath6 with @xmath10 = 10 @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> this increase in free energy can be attributed not only to electrostatic attraction but also to van der waals attraction . since @xmath16 increases with the number of spd adsorbed on the membrane surface , we assume , for simplicity , the linear function @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are constant . </S>",
    "<S> next , we obtained @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is a constant that is the sum of @xmath45 and @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the present experimental data show a good fit with this equation ( fig.4(c ) ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that the probability density of the two states is given by a boltzmann distribution at thermal equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> we used @xmath46 @xmath47  @xcite and @xmath48 @xmath47  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> small dna molecules are expected to adsorb on the membrane surface as t4 dna does . however , the critical droplet size , above which smaller dna adsorbs , shifts to a larger size since the adsorption energy decreases as dna length becomes shorter .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the globule - to - coil transition of dna on the membrane with an increase in the droplet size . </S>",
    "<S> the unfolding transition would be determined by the free energy as follows : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the loss of free energy due to the globule - to - coil transition , @xmath51 is the difference in adsorption energy of a dna on the membrane between coiled and globular dna ( @xmath52 ) , and @xmath53 is the loss of translational entropy due to the change in dna conformation . under the condition spd @xmath131.0 mm , the energy of the globule state is lower than that of the coil state : @xmath50 is an increasing function of @xmath39 . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath50 is a linear increasing function of @xmath7 ( @xmath54 ) . with the constant fitting parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , @xmath58 is given by @xmath59 , where f is the sum of @xmath60 , e , and @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> our experimental data show a good fit with this equation ( fig.4(d ) ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the adsorption of dna on lipid membranes has been reported ; dna adsorbed on cationic membranes @xcite and on neutral membranes with mg@xmath0 ion @xcite , and adsorption affects the conformation of dna . as shown in fig.3(d ) , after the unfolding transition , the network structure was formed by the bundling of multiple dna chains on the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that a bundle structure with the parallel ordering of dna chains is produced with a high spd concentration ( spd of @xmath131.0 mm ) and above an overlapping dna concentration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that dna in a confined space tends to exhibit network formation because dna accumulated on the membrane surface .     </S>",
    "<S> selective localization of dna ( green ) on phase - separated membrane interfaces , where the membranes were stained with rho - pe ( red ) , which partitions into the disordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> ( a ) coiled dna with 0.2 mm spd was localized in the ordered phase of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) globular dna with 1.0 mm spd was distributed in the disordered phase , and exhibited brownian motion . </S>",
    "<S> the membranes were composed of dppc and cholesterol ( dppc / cholesterol=1:1 ) @xcite . ]    furthermore , we investigated the behavior of dna molecules in a droplet covered by a heterogeneous membrane surface that mimics biological conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the fluidity of coexisting phases affects the interaction of membrane - associating molecules @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> typical fluorescent images of heterogeneous droplet membranes interacting with coiled ( 0.2 mm spd ) and globular ( 1.0 mm spd ) dna are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(a ) and ( b ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the results with homogeneous membranes , dna with spd tended to adhere to the membrane interfaces . </S>",
    "<S> we found that there was a clear difference in the localization preference between coiled and globular dna . </S>",
    "<S> coiled dna was localized in the ordered phase ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(a ) ) , whereas globular dna selectively interacted with the disordered phase ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 5(b ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the associated globular dna showed brownian motion within the disordered region of the phase - separated membrane . since the trend of spd adsorption on each membrane phase is unclear , the details of free energy are beyond the scope of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> however , factors that may contribute to selective adsorption can be considered . </S>",
    "<S> the attachment of coiled dna to the membrane may lead to a loss of translational entropy of lipid molecules , resulting in the localization of dna on the ordered phase . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , disordered phase - partitioning of globular dna may be explained in terms of the competition between adsorption energy and the bending elasticity of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> a disordered soft membrane can wrap the associating dna to overcome the bending energy of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> these considerations have been discussed previously together with the size - dependence of membrane - associating particles @xcite , i.e. , larger objects have a softer surface . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the present experimental result , in that folded dna should be treated as a particle that is larger than the segments of coiled dna . </S>"
