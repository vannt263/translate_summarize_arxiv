    "team decision theory has its roots in control theory and economics .",
    "marschak @xcite was perhaps the first to introduce the basic elements of teams and to provide the first steps toward the development of a _",
    "team theory_. radner @xcite provided foundational results for static teams , establishing connections between person - by - person optimality , stationarity , and team - optimality . the work of witsenhausen @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite on dynamic teams and characterization of information structures has been crucial in the progress of our understanding of dynamic teams .",
    "further discussion on the design of information structures in the context of team theory and economics applications are given in @xcite and @xcite , among a rich collection of other contributions not listed here .",
    "establishing the existence and structure of optimal policies is a challenging problem .",
    "existence of optimal policies for static and a class of sequential dynamic teams has been studied recently in @xcite .",
    "more specific setups and non - existence results have been studied in @xcite , @xcite . for a class of teams which are _ convex _",
    ", one can reduce the search space to a smaller parametric class of policies ( see @xcite , and for a comprehensive review , see @xcite ) .    in this paper ,",
    "our aim is to study the approximation of static and dynamic team problems using finite models which are obtained through the uniform discretization , on a finite grid , of the observation and action spaces of agents . in particular , we are interested in the asymptotic optimality of quantized policies .    in the literature",
    "relatively few results are available on approximating static or dynamic team problems .",
    "we can only refer the reader to @xcite,@xcite and a few references therein . with the exception of @xcite , these works in general study a specific setup ( the witsenhausen counterexample ) and are mostly experimental ; that is , they do not rigorously prove the convergence of approximate solutions .    in @xcite ,",
    "a class of static team problems are considered and the existence of smooth optimal strategies is studied . under fairly strong assumptions ,",
    "the existence of an optimal strategy with lipschitz continuous partial derivatives up to some order is proved . by using this result , an error bound on the accuracy of near optimal solutions",
    "is established , where near optimal strategies are expressed as linear combinations of basis functions with adjustable parameters . in @xcite ,",
    "the same authors investigated the approximation problem for witsenhausen s counterexample , which does not satisfy the conditions in @xcite ; the authors derived an analogous error bound on the accuracy of the near optimal solutions . for the result in @xcite both the error bound and the near optimal solutions depend on the knowledge of the optimal strategy for witsenhausen s counterexample .",
    "moreover , the method devised in @xcite implicitly corresponds to the discretization of only the action spaces of the agents .",
    "therefore , it involves only the approximation with regard to the action space , and does not correspond to a tractable approximation for the set of policies / strategies .",
    "particular attention has been paid in the literature to witsenhausen s counterexample .",
    "this problem has puzzled the control community for more than 40 years with its philosophical impact demonstrating the challenges that arise due to a non - classical information structure , and its formidable difficulty in obtaining an optimal or suboptimal solution .",
    "in fact , optimal policies and their value are still unknown , even though the existence of an optimal policy has been established using various methods @xcite . some relevant results on obtaining approximate solutions can be found in @xcite .",
    "certain lower bounds , that are not tight , building on information theoretic approaches are available in @xcite , see also @xcite . in this paper , we show that finite models obtained through the uniform quantization of the observation and action spaces lead to a sequence of policies whose cost values converge to the optimal cost .",
    "thus , with high enough computation power , one could guarantee that for any @xmath1 , an @xmath0-optimal policy can be constructed .",
    "we note that the operation of quantization has typically been the method to show that a non - linear policy can perform better than an optimal linear policy , both for witsenhausen s counterexample @xcite and another interesting model known as the gaussian relay channel problem @xcite .",
    "our findings show that for a large class of problems , quantized policies not only may perform better than linear policies , but that they are actually almost optimal .",
    "we finally note that although finding optimal solutions for finite models for witsenhausen s counterexample as the ones constructed in this paper was shown to be np - complete in @xcite , the task is still computationally less demanding than the method used in @xcite . loosely speaking , to obtain a near optimal solution using the method in @xcite , one has to compute the optimal partitions of the observation spaces and the optimal representation points in the action spaces .",
    "in contrast , the partitions of the observation spaces and the available representation points in the action spaces used by our method are known _",
    "a priori_. we also note that if one can establish smoothness properties of optimal policies such as differentiability or lipschitz continuity ( e.g. , as in @xcite ) , the methods developed in our paper can be used to provide rates of convergence for the sequence of finite solutions as the finite models are successively refined .    * contributions of the paper . *",
    "( i ) we establish that finite models asymptotically represent the true models in the sense that the solutions obtained by solving such finite models lead to cost values that converge to the optimal cost of the original model .",
    "thus , our approach can be viewed to be constructive ; even though the computational complexity is typically at least exponential in the cardinality of the finite model .",
    "( ii ) the approximation approach here provides , to our knowledge , the first rigorously established result showing that one can construct an @xmath0-optimal strategy for any @xmath1 through an explicit solution of a simpler problem for a large class of static and dynamic team problems , in particular for the witsenhausen s celebrated counterexample .",

    "we review the definition of witsenhausen s _ intrinsic model _ for sequential team problems . in section  [ boundedcase ]",
    "we consider finite _ observation _ approximations of static team problems with compact observation spaces and bounded cost , and prove the asymptotic optimality of strategies obtained from finite models . in section  [ unboundedcase ]",

    "@xmath4 is the number of actions taken , and each of these actions is supposed to be taken by an individual agent ( hence , an agent with perfect recall can also be regarded as a separate decision maker every time it acts ) .",
    "the pair @xmath5 is a measurable space on which an underlying probability can be defined .",
    "the pair @xmath6 denotes the measurable space from which the action @xmath7 of agent  @xmath8 is selected .",

    "we note that the intrinsic model of witsenhausen gives a set - theoretic characterization of information fields ; however , for borel spaces , the model above is equivalent to the intrinsic model for sequential team problems .    under this intrinsic model , a sequential team problem is _ dynamic _ if the information available to at least one agent is affected by the action of at least one other agent . a decentralized problem is",
