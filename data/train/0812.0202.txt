    "adhesive tapes are routinely used in a variety of situations including daily usage as stickers , in packing and sealing . yet",
    ", day - to - day experiences like intermittent peeling of an adhesive tape and the origin of the accompanying audible noise have remained ill understood .",
    "this may be partly attributed to the fact that adhesion is a highly interdisciplinary subject involving diverse but interrelated physical phenomena such as intermolecular forces of attraction at the interface , mechanics of contact , debonding and rupture , visco - plastic deformation and fracture @xcite , and frictional dissipation which operates during peeling @xcite . yet",
    "another reason is that most information on adhesion is obtained from quasistatic or near stationary conditions . apart from scientific interest , understanding the intermittent peel or the stick - slip process has relevance to industrial applications as well .",
    "for example , optimizing production schedules that involve pasting or peeling of an adhesive tapes at a rapid pace in an assembly line requires a good understanding of stick - slip dynamics . moreover , insight into the time dependent and dynamical aspects of adhesion",
    "is expected to be important in design of adhesives with versatile properties required in variety of applications , in understanding the mechanisms leading to the failure of adhesive joints as also in understanding biologically relevant systems such as the gecko@xcite or reorientation dynamics of cells @xcite .",
    "adhesion tests are essentially fracture tests designed to study adherence of solids and generally involve normal pulling off and peeling .",
    "such experiments can be performed under quasistatic or near - stationary and nonequilibrium conditions as well .",
    "the latter kind of experiments demonstrate the rate dependence of adhesive properties .",
    "it is this rate dependence and the inherent nonlinearity that leads to a variety of instabilities .",
    "these kinds of peeling experiments are comparatively easy to setup in a laboratory .",
    "moreover , the set up also allows one to record unusually long force waveforms and ae signals that should be helpful in extracting useful information on the nonlinear features of the system .",
    "one type of peeling experiment that yields dynamical information is carried out with an adhesive tape mounted on a roller subjected to a constant pull velocity @xcite .",
    "peeling experiments have also been performed under constant load conditions @xcite . at low pull velocities ,",
    "the velocity of the contact point @xmath0 keeps pace with the imposed velocity @xmath1 .",
    "the same is true at high velocities as well .",
    "however , there is an intermediate regime of traction velocities where the peeling is intermittent . peeling in this regime",
    "is accompanied by a characteristic audible noise @xcite .",
    "it must be stressed that these two stable dissipative branches refer to stationary branches .",
    "even so , the stick - slip dynamics observed in the intermediate region of pull velocities has been attempted by assuming an unstable branch connecting the two stable branches .",
    "the strain energy release rate shows a power law for low velocities with an exponent around 0.3 .",
    "the high velocity branch also shows a power law but with a much higher exponent value of about 5.5 @xcite .",
    "the low velocity branch is known to arise from viscous dissipation and that at high velocity corresponds to fracture .",
    "these studies report a range of wave forms starting from saw tooth , sinusoidal or even irregular wave form that has been termed chaotic @xcite .",
    "more recently , the dynamics of the peel point has been imaged as well @xcite .",
    "stick - slip processes are usually observed in systems subjected to a constant response where - in the force developed in the system is measured by dynamically coupling the system to a measuring device .",
    "the phenomenon is experienced routinely , for example , while writing with chalk piece on a black board , playing violin or walking down a staircase with the hand placed on the hand - rail .",
    "a large number of studies on stick - slip dynamics have been reported in systems ranging from atomic length scales , for instance , stick - slip observed using atomic force microscope @xcite to geological length scales like the stick - slip of tectonic plates causing earthquakes  @xcite .",
    "a few well known laboratory scale systems are - sliding friction @xcite and the portevin - le chatelier ( plc ) effect @xcite , a kind of plastic instability observed during tensile deformation of dilute alloys @xcite , to name only two .",
    "most stick - slip processes are characterized by the system spending a large part of the time in the stuck state and a short time in the slip state .",
    "this feature is observed both in experiment and in models .",
    "see for instance @xcite .",
    "a counter example where the time spent in the stuck is less than that in the slip state ( observed at high applied strain rates ) is the plc effect @xcite .",
    "these studies show that while the physical mechanisms that operate in different situations can be quite varied @xcite , in general , stick - slip results from a competition among the inherent internal relaxational time scales @xcite and the applied time scale . in the case of peeling ,",
    "one identifiable internal relaxation time scale is the viscoelastic time scale of the adhesive .",
    "other relevant time scales that may be operative need to be included for a proper description of the dynamics .",
    "all stick - slip systems are governed by deterministic nonlinear dynamics .",
    "models that attempt to explain the dynamical features of stick - slip systems use the macroscopic phenomenological negative force response ( nfr ) feature as an input although the unstable region is not accessible .",
    "this is also true for models dealing with the dynamics of the adhesive tape including the present work . in this context",
    ", it must be stated that there is no microscopic theory that predicts the negative force - velocity relation in most stick - slip situations except in the case of the plc effect where we have provided a dynamical interpretation of the negative strain rate sensitivity of the flow stress @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "there are several theoretical attempts to model the stick - slip process observed during peeling of an adhesive tape .",
    "maugis and barquin @xcite , were the first to write down a model set of equations suitable for the experimental situation and to carry out approximate dynamical analysis .",
    "these equations were later modified and a dynamical analysis of these equations was reported @xcite .",
    "however , the stick - slip oscillations were _ not _ obtained as a natural consequence of the equations of motion @xcite .",
    "indeed , these equations are singular@xcite .",
    "subsequently , we devised a special algorithm to solve these differential algebraic equations ( dae ) @xcite .",
    "this algorithm allows for dynamical jumps across the two stable branches of the peel force function .",
    "this was followed by converting the dae into a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ( ode ) by including the missing kinetic energy of the stretched tape thereby lifting the singular nature of the dae @xcite . apart from supporting dynamical jumps",
    ", the ode model exhibits rich dynamical features . however , all these studies discuss only contact point dynamics while the tape has a finite width .",
    "the ode model has been extended to include the spatial degrees of freedom that is crucial for describing the dynamics of the peel front as also for understanding the origin of acoustic emission @xcite .",
    "acoustic emission is commonly observed in an unusually large number of systems such as seismologically relevant fracture studies of rock samples @xcite , martensite transformation @xcite , micro - fracturing process @xcite , volcanic activity @xcite , collective dislocation motion @xcite etc .",
    "the general mechanism attributed to ae is the abrupt release of the stored potential energy although the underlying mechanisms triggering ae are system specific .",
    "the nondestructive nature of the ae technique has been useful in tracking the microstructural changes during the course of deformation by monitoring the ae signals .",
    "for instance , it is used in fracture studies of rock samples @xcite and more recently , a similar approach has been used in understanding collective behavior of dislocations @xcite . in both these cases , multiple transducers are used to locate the hypocenters through an inversion process of arrival times @xcite . in the latter case , by analysing the dislocations sources generating ae signals , the study establishes the fractal nature of the collective motion of dislocations .",
    "( in contrast to these dynamical studies , most studies on ae @xcite are limited to compiling the statistics of the ae signals in an effort to find experimental realizations of self - organized criticality @xcite . )",
    "however , in the case of peeling , using multiple transducers is far from easy and only a single transducer is used leading to scalar time series . in such situations ,",
    "dynamical information is traditionally recovered using nonlinear time series analysis @xcite . however",
    ", a major difficulty arises in the present case due to a high degree of noise present and the associated difficulties involved in curing the noise content .    despite large number of experimental investigations and to a lesser extent model studies , several issues related to intermittent",
    "peeling and the associated acoustic emission remain ill understood . for instance , there are no models ( even in the general area of stick - slip ) which show that the duration of the stick phase can be equal to or even less than that of the slip phase @xcite , a feature which is quite unlike conventional stick - slip dynamics . from a dynamical point of view",
    ", this is also suggestive of the existence of at least three time scales .",
    "the model represents the acoustic energy in terms of the rayleigh dissipation functional that depends on the local strain rate of the peel front and thus is sensitive to the nature of the peel front dynamics . while preliminary results of the model @xcite based on a small domain of parameters were encouraging , no systematic study of the influence of all the relevant time scales on the dynamics of the peel front was carried out .",
    "in particular , while the nature of experimental ae signals changes with the traction velocity , the study of the influence of pull speed on internal relaxational mechanisms , the consequent peel front dynamics and its relationship with the acoustic energy was not studied either .",
    "the principal objective of the present study is to understand the various contributing mechanisms to the intermittent peel process and its connection to acoustic emission .",
    "the objective is accomplished by carrying out a systematic study of the influence of the three internal relaxational time scales namely the two inertial time scales of the tape mass and the roller inertia , and dissipative time scale of the peel front .",
    "in particular , we report the influence of the experimentally relevant pull velocity ( covering the entire range ) on the peel front dynamics .",
    "these studies show that the model exhibits rich spatiotemporal peel front patterns ( including the stuck - peeled configurations that mimic fibrillar patterns seen in experiments ) arising due to the interplay of the three time scales .",
    "consequently , varied patterns of model acoustic signals are seen .",
    "another consequence of the inclusion of the three time scales is that it explains the recent observation that the duration of the slip phase can be larger than that of the stick - phase @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the model studies show that it is possible to establish a correspondence between the various types of model acoustic energy profiles with certain peel front patterns .",
    "more importantly , the study shows that even as the acoustic energy dissipated is the spatial average of the local strain rate , it can be noisy suggesting the possible deterministic origin of the experimental acoustic signals . here , we report a detailed analysis of the statistical and dynamical analysis of the experimental ae signals .",
    "the study shows that while the intermittent peeling is controlled by the peel force function , acoustic emission is controlled by the dynamics of the peel front patterns that determine the local strain rate .",
    "this coupled with a comparative study of a comprehensive nonlinear time series analysis ( tsa ) of the experimental ae signals for a wide range of traction velocities supplemented by a similar study on the model acoustic energy time series provides additional insights into the connection between ae signals and stick - slip dynamics . in particular , the model displays the recently observed experimental feature that the duration of the slip phase can be more than that of the stick phase with increase in the pull velocity .",
    "finally , the model studies together with the dynamical analysis of the model acoustic signal provide a dynamical explanation for the changes in the nature of the experimental ae signal in terms of the changes in the peel front patterns .",
    "a typical experimental set up consists of an adhesive tape mounted on a roller .",
    "the tape is pulled at a constant pull velocity using a motor . a schematic representation of the set up is shown in fig . [ tapewidth](a ) .",
    "the axis of the roller passes through the point o into the plane of the paper .",
    "the drive motor is positioned at o@xmath2 .",
    "let the distance between @xmath3 and @xmath4 be denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is the contact point on the peel front @xmath7 .",
    "let the peeled length of the tape @xmath8 be denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "several geometrical features can be discussed using a projection on to the plane of the paper .",
    "let the angle between the tangent to the contact point @xmath6 and @xmath10 be denoted by @xmath11 and the angle @xmath12 by @xmath13 .",
    "then , from the geometry of the fig",
    ". [ tapewidth](a ) , we get @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the diameter of the roller tape .",
    "let the local velocity of the peel point be denoted by @xmath0 and the displacement ( from a uniform stuck state ) of the peel front by @xmath17 .",
    "then , the pull velocity has to satisfy @xmath18 as the peel front has a finite width , we define the corresponding quantities along the peel front coordinate @xmath19 ( i.e. , along the contact line ) by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "then as the entire tape width is pulled a constant velocity , the above constraint generalizes to @xmath22dy = 0 ,   \\label{vconstraint}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the width of the tape .",
    "however , we are interested in the deformation of the peel front of the adhesive , which is a soft visco - elastic material . for the purpose of modeling , while we shall ignore the viscoelastic nature of the adhesive , we recognize its low modulus , i.e. , we assume an effective spring constant @xmath24 ( along the contact line ) whose value is much smaller than the spring constant of the tape material @xmath25 .",
    "this also implies that the force along @xmath8 equilibrates fast and therefore the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ vconstraint ] ) can be assumed to vanish for all @xmath19 .",
    "thus , the above equation reduces to eq .",
    "( [ localconstr ] ) .",
    "the present model is an extension of the ode model for the contact point dynamics @xcite .",
    "the ode model already contains information on the inertial time scale of the tape mass that allows for dynamical jumps across the two branches of the peel force function .",
    "the extension involves introducing the rayleigh dissipation functional to deal with acoustic emission apart from introducing the spatial degrees of freedom .",
    "the equations of motion for the contact line dynamics are derived by writing down the relevant energy terms consisting of the kinetic energy , potential energy and the energy dissipated during the peel process .",
    "the total kinetic energy @xmath26 is the sum of the rotational kinetic energy of the roller tape and the kinetic energy of the stretched part of the tape .",

    "this is given by    @xmath31 ^ 2 dy + { 1\\over2}\\int^b_0 { k_g b } \\big[{\\partial u(y ) \\over \\partial y } \\big]^2 dy .",
    "\\label{pe}\\ ] ]    the peel process always involves dissipation .",
    "indeed , the peel force function with the two stable branches , one corresponding to low velocities and another at high velocity arises from two different dissipative mechanisms .",
    "apart from this , there is an additional dissipation that arises from the rapid rupture of the peel front which in turn results in the accelerated motion of local regions of the peel front .",
    "we consider this accelerated motion of the local slip as the source responsible for the generation of acoustic signals @xcite .",
    "any rapid movement also prevents the system from attaining a quasistatic equilibrium which in turn generates dissipative forces that resist the motion of the slip .",
    "such dissipative forces are modeled by the rayleigh dissipation functional that depends on the gradient of the local displacement rate @xcite .",
    "indeed , such a dissipative term has proved useful in explaining the power law statistics of the ae signals during martensitic transformation @xcite as also in explaining certain ae features in fracture studies of rock sample @xcite .",
    "then , the total dissipation can be written as the sum of these two contributions    @xmath32 ^ 2 dy , \\label{diss}\\ ] ]    where @xmath33 physically represents the peel force function assumed to be derivable from a potential function @xmath34 ( see ref .",

    "following this , we interpret @xmath35 as the energy dissipated in the form of ae signals .",

    "( [ diss ] ) , the form of the peel force function we use is given by @xmath39 we stress here that as we are interested in the generic properties of the peeling process , the exact form of the peel force function used here is not important as long as major experimental features like the magnitude of the jump in the velocity across the two branches , the range of values of the measured peel force function , in particular the values at the maximum and minimum , are captured .",
    "as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ ke ] ) , there are two time scales ; one corresponding to the inertia of the tape mass and the other due to the roller inertia .",

    "it is more convenient to deal with scaled quantities .",

    "more importantly , the model acoustic energy is quite irregular even as it is of dynamical origin .",
    "this suggests the possibility that the experimental ae signals could be chaotic .",
    "however , often time series have undesirable systematic component , which needs to be removed from the original data .",
    "for instance , in the plc effect , the stress - strain time series has an overall increasing stress arising from the work hardening component of the stress @xcite which needs to be subtracted . in the present case ,",
    "the experimental data for high pull velocities does show a background variation .",
    "a simple way of eliminating this background component is to use a window averaging and subtract this component from the raw data .",

    "in summary , the present investigation is an attempt to understand the origin of the intermittent peeling of an adhesive tape and its connection to acoustic emission .",
    "_ at the conceptual level , we have established a relationship between stick - slip dynamics and the acoustic energy _ , the latter depends on the local strain rate @xcite which in turn is controlled by the roughness of the peel front . as the model is fully dynamical , one basic result that emerges",
    "is that the model acoustic energy is controlled by the nature of spatiotemporal dynamics of the peel front .",
    "further , even as the model acoustic emission is a dynamical quantity , the nature of @xmath111 turns out to be quite noisy depending on the possible interplay of different time scales in the model .",
    "thus , the highly noisy nature of the experimental signals need not necessarily imply stochastic origin of ae signal ; instead , they could be of deterministic origin .",
    "this motivated us to carry out a detailed analysis of statistical and dynamical features of the experimental ae signals .",
    "despite the high noise content , we have been able to demonstrate the existence of finite correlation dimension and positive lyapunov exponent for a window of pull speeds . the kaplan - yorke dimension ( for various traction velocities ) calculated from the lyapunov spectrum",
    "is consistent with the value obtained from the correlation integral .",
    "thus , the analysis establishes unambiguously the deterministic chaotic nature of the experimental ae signals .",
    "interestingly , the largest lyapunov exponent shows a decreasing trend toward the end of the chaotic window , a feature displayed by the model acoustic signal as well .",
    "the work also addresses the general problem of extracting dynamical information from noisy ae signals .",
    "a similar analysis of the model acoustic energy shows that @xmath111 is chaotic for a range of parameter values .",
    "_ more importantly , several qualitative features of the experimental ae signals such as the statistics of the signals and the change from burst to continuous type with increase in the pull velocity are also displayed by @xmath111 . _ the observed two stage power law distribution for the experimental ae signals [ fig .",
    "[ expt_dist](b ) ] is reproduced by the model [ fig .",
    "[ expt_dist](d ) ] .",
    "it must be emphasized that this power law distribution for the amplitudes is completely of dynamical origin .",
    "this result should be of general interest in the context of dynamical systems as there are very few models that generate power laws purely from dynamics .",
    "the only other example known to the authors is that of the plc effect where the amplitude of the stress drops shows a power law distribution within the context of the ananthakrishna model @xcite .",
    "the spatiotemporal patterns of the peel front are indeed rich and depend on the interplay of the three time scales .",
    "although , the nature of spatiotemporal patterns is quite varied , they can be classified as smooth synchronous , rugged , stuck - peeled and even nowhere stuck patterns . as expected on general consideration of dynamics ,",
    "rich patterns are observed for the case when all the three time scales are of similar magnitude ( illustrated for @xmath172 ) .",
    "all spatiotemporal patterns , except the smooth synchronous peel front are interesting . as a function of time",
    ", the nature of the peel front can go through a specific sequence of these patterns ( depending on the parameter values ) .",
    "the most interesting pattern is the stuck - peeled configuration which is reminiscent of fibrils observed in experiments @xcite . even among the sp configurations , there are variations , for example , rapidly changing , long lived , edge of peeling etc . despite the varied range of patterns , a few general trends of the influence of the parameters on the peel front patterns are worth noting .",
    "first , in general the number of stuck and peeled segments increases as @xmath61 is decreased .",
    "second , as the pull velocity is increased , the rapidly varying stuck - peeled configurations observed at low pull velocities become long lived . the dynamical signature of these two parameters are reflected in the nature of the phase space orbit .",
    "for instance , given a value of @xmath59 and @xmath61 , the nature of the phase space orbit changes only when @xmath76 is increased which allows the orbit to move way beyond the values of @xmath67 .",
    "the study of the model shows that while the intermittent peeling is controlled by the peel force function , the dynamics of the peel front is influenced by all the three time scales .",
    "this together with the dynamical analysis of the experimental acoustic emission signals establishes that deterministic dynamics is responsible for ae during peeling .",
    "the various sequences of peel front patterns and their time dependences lead to quite varied model acoustic signals .",
    "these can be classified as bunch of spikes , isolated bursts occurring at near regular intervals , continuous bursts with an overall envelope separated by quiescent state , continuous bursts overriding a near periodic triangular form , irregular waveform overriding a periodic component , and continuous irregular type .",
    "_ interestingly , our studies show that there is a definite correspondence between the model acoustic energy and the nature of peel front patterns even though @xmath223 is the spatial average of the local strain rate . _ despite this , two distinguishable time scales in @xmath223 can be detected , one corresponding to short term fluctuations and another corresponding to overall periodic component .",
    "the short term fluctuations can be readily identified when the model acoustic signal is fluctuating without any background component ( see for example fig .",
    "[ i2m1v1gup0_1](d ) ) .",
    "these rapid changes in @xmath111 arise due fast dynamic changes in the sp configurations .",
    "the minimum in @xmath111 corresponds to the situation where the average velocity jumps of the sp configurations are smaller compared to that at the preceding maximum . in contrast , the overall periodicity in @xmath223 ( for instance see fig . [ i2m1v2gup1](c ) among many other cases ) can be identified with the changes in the peel front patterns that occur over a cycle in the phase plot .",
    "the minima in the @xmath223 corresponds to the peel patterns where more segments are in stuck state than in the peeled state while the maxima corresponds to more stuck and peeled segments ( see figs .",
    "[ i2m1v2gup1](a ) , ( b ) ) .",
    "the corresponding phase plot usually goes through a cycle of visits between the low and high velocity branches .    often , however , the nature of the model acoustic energy signal can be complicated as in the case of low tape mass ( @xmath180 ) . even in such cases ,",
    "some insight is possible .",
    "this is aided by the analysis of the corresponding phase plot .",
    "for example for the low @xmath59 case where the roller inertia plays an important role in the dynamics , the rapidly fluctuating acoustic energy has an overall triangular envelope [ fig .",
    "[ i2m3v1gup01](e ) ] . on an expanded scale ,",
    "the convex envelope consists of seven local peaks [ fig .",
    "[ i2m3v1gup01](f ) ] .",
    "each of these is generated when the various peel front segments make abrupt jumps between the two branches of the peel force function .",
    "note that the phase space orbit has seven loops in this case [ fig .",
    "[ i2m3v1gup01](d ) ] .",
    "the general identification of the minima in @xmath111 with patterns that have more stuck segments than peeled segments still holds .",
    "similarly , the maxima in @xmath111 usually correspond to the presence of large number of stuck - peeled configurations .",
    "the above correspondence between the model acoustic energy and the peel front patterns provides insight into the transition from burst to continuous type of ae seen in experiments as a similar transition from burst type to continuous type is also seen in the model acoustic energy ( for large @xmath232 ) . at low pull velocities , the peel front goes through a cycle of patterns where most segments of the peel front ( or the entire peel front ) spends substantial time in the stuck state switching to stuck - peeled configuration . as the duration of the sp configuration is short and velocity bursts are large",
    ", @xmath223 is of burst type [ fig . [",
    "exptae](c ) ] . with increasing pull velocity ,",
    "only dynamic stuck - peeled configurations are seen which in turn leads to continuous ae signals [ figures .",
    "[ i5m3v2gu0_1_01](a , b ) ] .",
    "this coupled with time series analysis of the model acoustic signal shows that the associated positive lyapunov exponent decreases with increase in the traction velocity .",
    "this is precisely the trend observed for experimental signals as well .",
    "thus , the decreasing trend of the largest lyapunov exponent can be attributed to the peel front breaking up into large number of small segments providing insight into stick - slip dynamics and its connection to the ae process .",
    "the present study has relevance to the general area of stick - slip dynamics .",
    "as mentioned earlier , models for stick - slip dynamics use negative force - drive rate relation . in such models",
    ", the phase space orbit generally sticks to the slow manifold ( stable branches ) of the force - drive rate function .",
    "this leads to clearly identifiable stick and slip phases , the former lasting much longer than the latter .",
    "however , recent work on imaging the peel point dynamics @xcite shows that the ratio of the stick phase to the slip phase , is about two or even less than unity for high peel velocities . while all the known models of the peel process predict that the duration of the stick phase is longer than that of the slip phase , our model displays the experimentally observed feature .",
    "this feature emerges in the model due to the interplay of the three time scales aided by incomplete relaxation of the relevant modes .",
    "our studies show that _ only _ for low pull velocity and high @xmath59 do we observe the stick phase lasting much longer than the slip phase .",
    "_ as the pull velocity is increased , and for all other parameter values , we find that the duration of the slip phase _",
    "( peel velocity being larger than unity ) _ is nearly the same as or less than that of the stick phase _",
    "( peel velocity less than unity ) .",
    "further , the present model provides an example of the richness of spatiotemporal dynamics arising when more than two time scales are involved . in this context , we emphasize that the introduction of the rayleigh dissipation functional to model the acoustic energy is crucial for the richness of the spatiotemporal peel front patterns .",
    "it is important to note that this kind of dissipative term is specific to spatially extended systems as it represents relaxation of neighboring points on the peel front .",
    "the present study has relevance to time dependent issues of adhesion .",
    "for instance , apart from the fact that the time series analysis addresses the general problem of extracting dynamical information from noisy ae signals , it may have relevance to failure of adhesive joints and composites that are subject to fluctuating loads .",
    "the failure time can be estimated by calculating the lyapunov spectrum for the ae signals .",
    "if the largest lyapunov exponent is positive , the inverse of the exponent should give an estimate of the time scale over which the failure can occur and hence could prove to be useful in predicting failure of joints .",
    "the present study should also help to optimize production schedules in peeling tapes .",
    "finally , several features of the present study are common to the plc effect even though the underlying mechanism is very different . in this case",
    "the repeated occurrence of stress drops during constant strain rate deformation @xcite , are associated with the formation and possible propagation of dislocation bands that are visible to the naked eye .",
    "the phenomenon occurs only in a window of applied strain rates .",
    "the instability is attributed to the pinning and unpinning of dislocations from solute atmosphere , yet , the dominant feature underlying the instability is the negative strain rate sensitivity of the flow stress that has two stable branches separated by an unstable branch . clearly , these features are similar to the occurrence of the peel instability within a window of pull velocities and the existence of unstable branch in the peel force function .",
    "further , the ananthakrishna ( ak ) model for the plc instability predicts that the stress drops should be chaotic in a subinterval of the instability domain @xcite .",
    "this prediction has been verified subsequently through the analysis of experimental stress - strain curves obtained from single and polycrystals @xcite .",
    "this feature is again similar to the existence of chaotic dynamics observed in a mid range of pull velocities in the peeling problem , both in experiment and in the model . in the case of the plc effect",
    ", one finds that the positive lyapunov exponent characterizing the stress - time series decreases toward the end of chaotic window , both in experiments and in the ak model . again",
    "this feature is also seen in the present peel model as also in experimental ae signals .",
    "dynamically , in the case of the ak model for the plc effect the decreasing trend of the positive lyapunov exponent has been shown to be a result of a forward hopf bifurcation ( hb ) followed by a reverse hb @xcite . in the case of peeling problem as well ,",
    "the instability begins with a forward hb followed by a reverse hb . finally , in the plc effect ( both in experiments and the ak model ) , as in the peeling problem",
    ", the duration of the slip phase can be longer than that of the stick phase with increasing drive rate .",
    "as many of these features are common to two different systems , it is likely that these are general features in other stick - slip situations with multiple time scales that are limited to a window of drive rates with multiple participating time scales .",
    "a few comments may be in order about the model , in particular about the parameters that are crucial for the dynamics . while the agreement of several statistical and dynamical features of the model ( for several sets of parameter values ) with the experimental ae series is encouraging , it would be interesting to verify model results for other sets of parameters .",
    "for instance , it is clear that the roller inertia and the inertia of the tape mass are experimentally assessable parameters .",
    "thus , the influence of these two inertial time scales can in principal be studied in experiments . however",
    ", conventional experiments have been performed keeping these parameters fixed , presumably , as there has been no suggestion that the dynamics can be sensitive to these variables .",
    "it would be interesting to verify the predicted dynamical changes in the ae signals as a function of these two parameters .",
    "as for the influence of the dissipation parameter @xmath61 , the range of physically reasonable values of @xmath61 is expected to be small ( @xmath233 to @xmath234 ) as argued .",
    "interestingly , the region of low @xmath61 is indeed the region where both statistics and dynamical features compare well with that of the experiments .",
    "however , within the scope of the model , the visco - elastic properties of the adhesive have been modeled using an effective spring constant .",
    "( this kind of assumption is common to studies in adhesion and tackiness etc @xcite . )",
    "however , it is possible to include this feature as well .",
    "finally , it must be stated that features that critically depend on thickness of the film and its visco - elastic properties such the shape of peel front are beyond the scope of the present model ."
