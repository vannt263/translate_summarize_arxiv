    "a number of experimental facilities to significantly improve on present sensitivity to the connecting mixing @xmath3 in neutrino oscillations and have access to the cp - violating phase @xmath4 have been discussed in the literature : neutrino factories ( neutrino beams from boosted - muon decays ) , superbeams ( very intense conventional neutrino beams ) , improved reactor experiments and more recently @xmath5-beams @xcite .",
    "the original standard scenario for beta beams with lower @xmath6 and short baseline @xmath7  km from cern to frejus with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ions has seen a variant by using an electron capture facility for monochromatic neutrino beams @xcite .",
    "new proposals also include the high @xmath10 value @xmath11 and @xmath12 isotopes in a @xmath13 facility @xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss the physics reach that a high energy facility for ec beams may provide with the expected sps upgrade at cern .",
    "such study has been made for the standard beta beam facility @xcite . in section  2",
    "we discuss the virtues of the suppressed oscillation channel @xmath14 in order to have access to the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the interest of energy dependence , as obtainable in the ec facility , is emphasized . in section  3",
    "we present new results on the comparison between ( low energies , short baseline ) and ( high energies , long baseline ) configurations for an ec facility with a single ion .",
    "section  4 gives our conclusions .",
    "the observation of @xmath15 violation needs an experiment in which the emergence of another neutrino flavour is detected rather than the deficiency of the original flavour of the neutrinos . at the same time , the interference needed to generate cp - violating observables can be enhanced if both the atmospheric and solar components have a similar magnitude .",
    "this happens in the suppressed @xmath16 transition .",
    "the appearance probability @xmath17 as a function of the distance between source and detector @xmath18 is given by @xcite    @xmath19    where @xmath20 .",
    "the three terms of eq .",
    "( [ prob ] ) correspond , respectively , to contributions from the atmospheric and solar sectors and their interference .",
    "as seen , the @xmath15 violating contribution has to include all mixings and neutrino mass differences to become observable .",
    "the four measured parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 have been fixed throughout this paper to their mean values @xcite .    from general arguments of cpt invariance and absence of absorptive parts",
    "the cp - odd probability is odd in time and then odd in the baseline l ( formally ) .",
    "vacuum oscillations are only a function of @xmath23 so that , at fixed @xmath24 , the cp - odd probability is odd in the energy ( formally ) .",
    "this proves that the study of neutrino oscillations in terms of neutrino energy will be able to separate out the cp phase @xmath4 from the mixing parameters .",
    "a control of this energy may be obtained from the choice of the boost in the ec facility with a single ion . in the beams with a continuous spectrum ,",
    "the neutrino energy has to be reconstructed in the detector . in water - cerenkov detectors ,",
    "this reconstruction is made from supposed quasielastic events by measuring both the energy and direction of the charged lepton .",
    "this procedure suffers from non - quasielastic background , from kinematic deviations due to the nuclear fermi momentum and from dynamical suppression due to exclusion effects @xcite . for ec decay ,",
    "the rare - earth nuclei above @xmath25 have a small enough half - life for electron capture processes .",
    "this is in contrast with the proposal of ec beams with fully stripped long - lived ions @xcite .",
    "we discuss the option of short - lived ions @xcite .",
    "the neutrinos emerging from a boosted ion beam decaying by ec are concentrated inside a narrow cone around the forward direction . if the ions are kept in the decay ring longer than the half - life , the energy distribution of the neutrino flux arriving to the detector in absence of neutrino oscillations is given by the master formula    @xmath26    with a dilation factor @xmath27 .",
    "it is remarkable that the result is given only in terms of the branching ratio and the neutrino energy and independent of nuclear models . in eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) , @xmath28 is the total number of ions decaying to neutrinos . as a result ,",
    "such a facility will measure the neutrino oscillation parameters by changing the @xmath29 s of the decay ring ( energy dependent measurement ) and there is no need of energy reconstruction in the detector .    for the study of the physics reach associated with such a facility , we combine two different energies for the same @xmath30 ion using two setups . in all cases we consider @xmath31 decaying ions / year , a water cerenkov detector with fiducial mass of @xmath32  kton and both appearance ( @xmath33 ) and disappearance ( @xmath34 ) events .",
    "setup i is associated with a five year run at @xmath0 ( close to the minimum energy to avoid atmospheric neutrino background ) plus a five year run at @xmath1 ( the maximum energy achievable at present sps ) , with a baseline @xmath7  km from cern to frejus .",
    "the results for setup i are going to be compared with those for setup ii , associated with a five year run at @xmath1 plus a five year run at @xmath2 ( the maximum achievable at the upgraded sps with proton energy of @xmath35  gev ) , with a baseline @xmath36  km from cern to canfranc .    for the setup",
    "i we generate the statistical distribution of events from assumed values of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding fit is shown in fig .",
    "[ fit - setupi ] for selected values of @xmath3 from @xmath37 to @xmath38 and covering a few values of the cp phase @xmath4 .",
    "as observed , the principle of an energy dependent measurement ( illustrated here with two energies ) is working to separate out the two parameters . with this configuration",
    "the precision obtainable for the mixing ( even at 1 degree ) is much better than that for the cp phase .",
    "the corresponding exclusion plot which defines the sensitivity to discover cp violation @xmath39 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fit - ec - des ] .",
    "for @xmath40  cl the sensitivity to see cp violation becomes significant for @xmath41 .    in the case of setup",
    "ii the longer baseline for @xmath1 leads to a value of @xmath23 well inside the second oscillation ( see fig .  [ proba ] ) . in that case the associated strip in the ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) plane has a more pronounced curvature , so that the two parameters can be better disantangled .",
    "the statistical distribution generated for some assumed values of ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) has been fitted and the @xmath42 values obtained .",
    "the results are given in fig .",
    "[ fit - ec ] .",
    "qualitatively , one notices that the precision reachable for the cp phase is much better than that for setup i. one should emphasize that this improvement in the cp phase has been obtained with the neutrino channel only , using two appropriate different energies . the corresponding exclusion plot which defines the sensitivity to discover cp violation @xmath39",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fit - ec - des ] .",
    "for @xmath40  cl the sensitivity to see cp violation becomes now significant even for values of @xmath3 smaller than those for setup i.    at the time of the operation of this proposed facility it could happen that the connecting mixing @xmath3 is already known from the approved experiments for second generation neutrino oscillations , like double chooz , t2k and nova . to illustrate the gain obtainable in the sensitivity to discover cp violation from the previous knowledge of @xmath3 we present in fig .",
    "[ fit - ec - con ] the expected sensitivity with the distribution of events depending on a single parameter @xmath4 for a fixed known value of @xmath3 .",
    "the result is impressive : even for a mixing angle of one degree , the cp violation sensitivity at @xmath40  cl reaches values around @xmath43 for setup ii .",
    "the simulations of the physics output for ec beams indicate : 1 ) the upgrade to higher energy ( @xmath44  gev ) is crucial to have a better sensitivity to cp violation , which is the main objective of the next generation neutrino oscillation experiments , iff accompanied by a longer baseline ; 2 ) the best @xmath23 in order to have a higher sensitivity to the mixing @xmath45 is not the same than that for the cp phase . like the phase - shifts ,",
    "the presence of @xmath4 is easier to observe when the energy of the neutrino beams enters into the region of the second oscillation .",
    "the mixing is better seen around the first oscillation maximum , instead . in particular ,",
    "setup ii in ec beams , i.e. , with @xmath46 between @xmath47 and @xmath32 and a baseline @xmath36  km ( canfranc ) , has an impressive sensitivity to cp violation , reaching a sensitivity around @xmath48 , for @xmath40  cl , or better ( if some knowledge on the value of @xmath3 is previously established ) .",
    "besides the feasibility studies for the machine , most important for physics is the study of the optimal configuration by combining low energy with high energy neutrino beams , short baseline with long baseline and/or ec monochromatic neutrinos with @xmath8 @xmath49 antineutrinos ."
