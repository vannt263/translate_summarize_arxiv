    "a quarter of century ago kurt gottfried , by considering high - energy electron - proton scattering and the nonrelativistic quark model of hadrons , found @xcite a sum rule relating the proton charge mean squared radius @xmath4 and the proton magnetic moment @xmath5 with the integral over the total proton photoproduction cross - section @xmath6 in the following form @xmath7\\label{a1},\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the energy loss in the laboratory frame , @xmath9 is the fine structure constant and @xmath10 is the proton mass .",
    "nowadays we know , that the gottfried sum rule can not be fulfilled as the corresponding integral diverges due to the well known rise of the total proton photoproduction cross - section at high energies",
    ".    in this contribution by a distinct way from the gottfried approach ( utilizing analytic properties of the forward compton scattering amplitude on the proton ) a proton sum rule similar to ( [ a1 ] ) can be derived , however , suffering from the same integral divergence alike as in ( [ a1 ] ) and suffering also from the unknown left - hand cut contribution .    in order to avoid both of these shortcomings we are interested in nucleon isodoublet ( proton and neutron ) simultaneously and",
    "derive new sum rule , relating proton dirac radius and anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and the neutron to the integral over a difference of the total proton and neutron photoproduction cross - sections .",
    "then , in the precision of the isotopic violation , a mutual nullification of the left - hand cut proton and neutron contributions , as well as a convergence of the corresponding integral in the sum rule , is achieved .    because @xmath0 and @xmath1 belong to the same isodoublet , possess the spin s=1/2 and as a result their electromagnetic ( em ) structure is also completely described by dirac and pauli form factors like proton and neutron",
    ", one can follow the same procedure and derive a similar sum rule , relating @xmath0 and @xmath1 dirac radii and anomalous magnetic moments of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with the convergent integral over a difference of the total @xmath0 and @xmath1 photoproduction cross - sections .",
    "as is well known , the proton and neutron are constituents of atomic nuclei with the spin s=1/2 , the em structure of which is completely described by two independent , e.g. dirac @xmath11 and pauli @xmath12 , form factors , defined by the relation @xmath13u(p ) , \\label{a2}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , @xmath17 are the free nucleon dirac bi - spinors .",
    "then the asymptotic form of the very high energy elastic electron - nucleon differential cross - section in the one - photon approximation is @xmath18 . \\label{a3}\\ ] ]    further , let us consider a very high energy peripheral electroproduction process on nucleons @xmath19 where the produced hadronic state @xmath20 is moving closely to the direction of the initial nucleon .",
    "its matrix element in the one photon approximation takes the form @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "now , by means of the method of equivalent photons @xcite , examining the nucleon in the rest , the electron energy to be very high and the small photon momentum transfer , one can express the differential cross - section of the process ( [ a4 ] ) through integral over the total nucleon photoproduction cross - section .    really , applying to ( [ a5 ] ) the sudakov expansion @xcite of the photon transferred 4-vector @xmath23 @xmath24 into the almost light - like vectors    @xmath25    the gribov representation @xcite of the metric tensor    @xmath26    where @xmath27 and transforming the phase space volume of the final state suitably , one obtains @xmath28 ^ 2 } i m \\tilde{a}(s_1,{\\bf{q}})\\ ] ] with @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 to be the imaginary part of the forward compton scattering amplitude on the nucleon @xmath32 with only the intermediate state @xmath20",
    ".    finally , for the case of small photon momentum transfer squared in ( [ a9 ] ) and by an application of the optical theorem @xmath33 one obtaines the relation @xmath34 between the differential cross - section of the process ( [ a4 ] ) and the total nucleon photoproduction cross - section .",
    "next step is an investigation of analytic properties of the almost forward compton scattering amplitude @xmath35 in @xmath36-plane .",
    "they consist in one - nucleon intermediate state pole at @xmath37 , the right - hand cut starting at the pion - nucleon threshold @xmath38 and the @xmath39-channel left - hand cut starting from @xmath40 . defining the path integral @xmath41 @xmath42    from the gauge invariant light - cone projection @xmath43 of the part @xmath44 of the total compton scattering tensor with photon",
    "first absorbed and then emitted along the fermion line , in @xmath36-plane , as presented in fig.1 and once closing the contour @xmath45 to upper half - plane , another one to lower half - plane , the following sum rule @xmath46 appears with @xmath47 to be the one - nucleon intermediate state pole contribution .",
    "then , taking into account ( [ a3 ] ) and ( [ a9 ] ) and considering proton and neutron separately , one comes from ( [ a13 ] ) ( for more detail see appendix d in @xcite ) to the sum rules for the proton @xmath48 and for the neutron @xmath49 where the obreviations @xmath50 and @xmath51 denote the left - hand cut contributions in ( [ a13 ] ) for proton and neutron , respectively .    a similar proton sum rule to ( [ a1 ] ) can be now found taking a derivative of both sides in ( [ a14 ] ) according to @xmath52 at @xmath53 and substituting the relation ( [ a11 ] ) for proton .",
    "however , in order to avoid the abovementioned problems we substract ( [ a15 ] ) from ( [ a14 ] ) and as a result ( due to a small isotopic invariance violation in the em interactions ) one achieves a mutual annulation of the left - hand cut proton and neutron contributions as follows @xmath54 moreover , taking a derivative according to @xmath52 of both sides in ( [ a16 ] ) and employing the relation ( [ a9 ] ) , one comes for @xmath53 to the new sum rule relating dirac mean squared radius and anomalous magnetic moments of the proton and the neutron to the integral over a difference of the total proton and neutron photoproduction cross - sections @xmath55\\ ] ] with @xmath56 , in which just a mutual cancellation of the rise of the latter cross sections for @xmath57 is achieved .",
    "isodoublet of nuclei @xmath0 and @xmath1 has , like nucleons , spin s=1/2 and the elastic and inelastic scatterings of electrons on these nuclei are described by similar formulas like nucleons . only normalizations of the corresponding dirac and pauli form factors are slightly different @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are anomalous magnetic moments of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "so , repeating the same procedure with the latter nuclei one obtaines a new sum rule of the following form @xmath62- \\frac{\\mu_{he^3}^2}{4m_{he^3}^2}+\\frac{\\mu_{h^3}^2}{4m_{h^3}^2}= \\label{a19 } \\\\",
