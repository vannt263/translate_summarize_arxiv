    "apart from confirming , yet again , the long - standing solar neutrino problem  @xcite , the recent results from the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno ) on neutral current ( nc ) events  @xcite have given strong evidence that solar neutrinos convert mainly to an active neutrino flavor .",
    "in addition , valuable spectral and day / night information has been provided  @xcite .",
    "this adds to the already robust evidence that an extension of the standard model of particle physics is necessary in the lepton sector .",
    "although certainly not yet unique , at least for the case of solar neutrinos , which can be accounted well by spin - flavor precession  @xcite or non - standard neutrino matter interactions  @xcite , the most popular joint explanation of solar and atmospheric experiments is provided by the neutrino oscillations hypothesis , with neutrino mass - squared differences of the order of @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .    in the wake of the recent sno nc results we have re - analyzed the global status of current neutrino oscillation data including these and the remaining solar data  @xcite as well as the current atmospheric  @xcite samples , including the 1489 days super - kamiokande data  @xcite and the most recent macro data  @xcite .",
    "motivated by the stringent limits from reactor experiments  @xcite we adopt an effective two - neutrino approach in which solar and atmospheric analyses decouple . however our effective two - neutrino approach is generalized in the sense that it takes into account that a light sterile neutrino  @xcite , advocated to account for the lsnd anomaly  @xcite , may take part in both solar and atmospheric conversions .",
    "the natural setting for such a light sterile neutrino is provided by four - neutrino models . in this paper",
    "we will determine the constraints on oscillation parameters in this generalized scenario following from solar and atmospheric data separately .",
    "such separate analyses are necessary ingredients towards a combined analysis of all current oscillation data , including solar , atmospheric , negative short - baseline data and the lsnd experiment  @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite such separate analyses can be performed independently of the details of the four - neutrino mass scheme .    since the release of the latest sno data in april 2002 a number of global solar neutrino analyses in terms of active oscillations appeared  @xcite .",
    "moreover , it has been shown by model - independent comparisons of the sno cc rate with the sno nc and super - k rates that transitions of solar neutrinos into sterile neutrinos are strongly constrained by the recent data ( see , _ e.g. _ , refs .",
    "however , so - far no dedicated global analyses exist , where a participation of a sterile neutrino in the oscillations is fully taken into account . here",
    "we present a complete solar neutrino analysis including sterile neutrinos , determining the allowed ranges for the oscillation parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 , as well as for the parameter @xmath13 describing the active - sterile admixture .",
    "furthermore , we investigate in detail the impact of the sno neutral current , spectral and day / night data and compare with an analysis where we use only the charged current rate from sno .    concerning the atmospheric data , we perform an update of previous analyses  @xcite , adopting again the most general parameterization of atmospheric neutrino oscillations in the presence of sterile neutrino mixing , characterized by four parameters .",
    "we find that the recent 1489-day super - kamiokande data combined with the latest macro data lead to considerably stronger rejection against a sterile neutrino contribution to the oscillations than the previous 1289-day data sample .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sol - oscill ] we set the general parametrization for solar oscillations in the presence of active - sterile mixing . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sol - analysis ] we briefly describe the solar neutrino data and their analysis . in sec .",
    "[ sec : sol - results ] we present the results of our analysis , aimed at studying the impact of recent solar data in the determination of the solar neutrino oscillation parameters , assuming , as mentioned , that the @xmath0 may convert to a mixture of active and sterile neutrinos .",
    "we give the regions of oscillation parameters for different allowed @xmath14 values , display the global behavior of @xmath15 and @xmath16 , calculated with respect to the favored active lma solution , and evaluate the impact of the sno nc , spectral and day / night data .",
    "present solar data exhibit a higher degree of rejection against non - lma and/or non - active oscillation solutions , which we quantify , giving also the absolute goodness of fit ( gof ) of various oscillation solutions .",
    "our solar neutrino results are briefly compared with those obtained in other recent analyses in sec .",

    "[ sec : atm - results ] we describe our results for atmospheric oscillation parameters in an improved global fit of current atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "we quantify the impact both of our improved analysis as well as that of the recent data in rejecting against the sterile oscillation hypothesis .",
    "we update the corresponding regions of oscillation parameters and display the global behavior of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we compare the situation before - and - after the recent 1489-day atmospheric super - k data samples and give the present gof of the oscillation hypothesis . in sec .",
    "[ sec : atm - compare ] , we briefly compare our atmospheric neutrino results with those of other analyses . finally , in sec .  [",
    "sec : conclusions ] we present our conclusions .",
    "in the following we will analyze solar neutrino data in the general framework of mixed active - sterile neutrino oscillations . in this case the electron neutrino produced in the sun converts into a combination of an active non - electron neutrino @xmath19 ( which again is a combination of @xmath1 and @xmath20 ) and a sterile neutrino @xmath21 : @xmath22 the parameter @xmath14 with @xmath13 describes the fraction of the sterile neutrino participating in the solar oscillations .",
    "therefore , the oscillation probabilities depend on the three parameters @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath14",
    ". the natural framework of light sterile neutrinos participating in oscillations are four - neutrino mass schemes , proposed to account for the lsnd result  @xcite in addition to solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations . for previous studies of solar neutrino oscillation in a four - neutrino framework see refs .",
    "@xcite and for an exact definition of the solar parameters and adopted approximations see ref .",
    "@xcite .      as experimental data ,",
    "we use the solar neutrino rates of the chlorine experiment homestake  @xcite ( @xmath23  snu ) , the most recent result of the gallium experiments sage  @xcite  ( @xmath24  snu ) and gallex / gno  @xcite ( @xmath25  snu ) , as well as the 1496-days super - kamiokande data sample  @xcite in the form of 44 bins ( 8 energy bins , 6 of which are further divided into 7 zenith angle bins ) .",
    "in addition to this , we include the latest results from sno presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the form of 34 data bins ( 17 energy bins for each day and night period ) .",
    "therefore , in our statistical analysis we use @xmath26 observables , which we fit in terms of the three parameters @xmath12 , @xmath11 and @xmath14 , with a @xmath27 of the form @xmath28    in order to fully isolate the impact of the recent neutral current , spectral and day / night information of the sno result , we also present an analysis which does not include such information . to this aim",
    "we use only the sno events with energy higher than 6.75  mev , for which the nc component is negligible  @xcite .",
    "we sum these events to a single rate , combining with cl , ga rates and full super - k data , as described above .",
    "this procedure is analogous to the pre - sno - nc situation , except that we take advantage of the enhanced statistics on the cc rate provided by the new data .",
    "we will refer to this analysis as sno@xmath29  analysis and it contains 48 data points .",
    "the comparison with the analysis including the complete sno data published this year ( sno@xmath30 ) allows us to highlight the impact of the sno nc , spectral and day / night information .    for the solar neutrino fluxes we use the standard solar model ( ssm ) flux  @xcite ,",
    "including its standard @xmath31 flux prediction measurement of ref .",
    "@xcite . ] . motivated by the excellent agreement of the recent sno nc result with the predictions of the standard solar model , we prefer to adopt a boron - fixed analysis .",
    "however , for case of the lma solution we explicitly illustrate the effect of this assumption by performing also a boron - free analysis , where we treat the solar @xmath31 flux as free parameter in the fit . for simplicity",
    "we neglect the @xmath32 and @xmath33 neutrino fluxes , whose contribution to the present solar neutrino experiments is marginal , while for the @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 fluxes we use the ssm value given in ref .",
    "@xcite , taking properly into account their theoretical uncertainties and cross - correlations in the calculation of the @xmath40 function .    for the neutrino",
    "cross sections of chlorine , sage , gallex / gno and super - k we assume the same as used in previous papers  @xcite , while for the cc and nc neutrino deuteron differential cross sections relevant for sno we use the tables given in  @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the cross - section uncertainties to the covariance matrix for the chlorine and gallium experiments is calculated as suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite . for a given experiment ( chlorine or gallium )",
    "we use full correlation of the error on the cross section for low - energy neutrino fluxes ( @xmath34 , @xmath37 , @xmath35 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) , but no correlation of the cross section error between the low - energy fluxes and the higher - energy @xmath31 flux .",
    "the neutrino survival probability @xmath41 is extracted from the neutrino evolution operator @xmath42 , which we factorize as a product of three factors @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 corresponding to propagation in the sun , vacuum , and earth , respectively .",
    "the first and last factors include matter effects with the corresponding density profiles given in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite . as a simplifying approximation",
    ", we assume that @xmath43 depends only on the neutrino production point @xmath46 , @xmath44 only on the sun - earth distance @xmath47 and @xmath45 depends only on the zenith - angle @xmath48 of the incoming neutrinos .",
    "therefore in our calculations we neglect the small correlation between seasonal effects and day - night asymmetry  @xcite . for each value of the neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath49 , @xmath11 and @xmath14 we calculate the neutrino survival probability @xmath41 by averaging over @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , properly accounting for all the interference terms between @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "special care is taken in including all the theoretical and experimental errors and their cross - correlations in the calculation of the covariance matrix , for which we follow the description of ref .",
    "@xcite ( covariance approach ) . in particular , the errors associated to the boron - flux shape , the energy - scale and the energy - resolution uncertainties of the super - kamiokande and sno experiments are recalculated for each point in parameter space .",
    "in order to determine the expected event numbers for the various solar neutrino experiments we calculate the @xmath0 survival probability for each point in parameter space of ( @xmath50 ) and convolute it with the standard solar model neutrino fluxes  @xcite and the relevant neutrino cross sections .",
    "we have compared such expected event numbers with the data described above , taking into account the detector characteristics and appropriate response functions .",
    "using the above - mentioned @xmath27 we have performed a global fit of solar neutrino data , whose results we now summarize .     allowed regions of @xmath51 and @xmath12 for @xmath52 ( active oscillations ) , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",

    "the first thing to notice is the impact of the sno nc , spectral , and day / night data in improving the determination of the oscillation parameters : the shaded regions after their inclusion are much smaller than the hollow regions delimited by the corresponding sno@xmath29confidence contours . especially important",

    "the setting for such scenarios are four - neutrino mass schemes  @xcite . in such schemes , besides the solar and atmospheric mass - splittings , there is also a large @xmath132 motivated by the lsnd experiment  @xcite .",
    "in contrast with the case of solar @xmath0 oscillations , the constraints on the @xmath1content in atmospheric oscillations are not so stringent : in fact such constrains are provided by atmospheric data themselves  @xcite . as a result to describe atmospheric neutrino oscillations in this general framework",
    "@xcite we need two more parameters besides the standard 2-neutrino oscillation parameters @xmath133 and @xmath134 .",

    "furthermore , some of the older experiments have no angular sensitivity , and thus can not be used to discriminate between active and sterile neutrino conversion , our main goal .",
    "our statistical analysis of the atmospheric data is similar to that used in ref .",
    "@xcite , except that we now take advantage of the new super - kamiokande data and of the full ten - bin zenith - angle distribution for the contained events , rather than the five - bin distribution employed previously .",
    "we have now @xmath144 observables , which we fit in terms of the four relevant parameters @xmath134 , @xmath133 , @xmath135 and @xmath136 : @xmath145    concerning the theoretical monte - carlo , we improve the method presented in ref .  @xcite by properly taking into account the scattering angle between the incoming neutrino and the scattered lepton directions .",
    "this was already the case for sub - gev contained events , however previously  @xcite we made the simplifying assumption of full neutrino - lepton collinearity in the calculation of the expected event numbers for the multi - gev contained and up - going-@xmath143 data samples . while this approximation is still justified for the stopping and thru - going muon samples , in the multi - gev sample the theoretically predicted value for down - coming @xmath1 is systematically higher if full collinearity is assumed .",
    "the reason for this is that the strong suppression observed in these bins can not be completely ascribed to the oscillation of the down - coming neutrinos ( which is small due to small travel distance ) .",
    "because of the non - negligible neutrino - lepton scattering angle at these multi - gev energies there is a sizable contribution from up - going neutrinos ( with a higher conversion probability due to the longer travel distance ) to the down - coming leptons . however , this problem is less visible when the angular information of multi - gev events is included in a five angular bins presentation of the data , as previously assumed  @xcite .",
    "folding together the atmospheric neutrino fluxes  @xcite , our calculated neutrino survival probabilities including earth matter effects with the profile of ref .",

    "we obtain the bounds ( cfr.eq .  ):",
    "@xmath292    to understand why fixing or not - fixing the @xmath31 flux leads to such a different behavior , we illustrate in the right panel of fig .  [ fig : kam - etas ] the dependence on @xmath14 of the @xmath289 allowed range for @xmath12 from the analysis of solar data alone , both for the boron - fixed ( green ) and the boron - free ( red ) cases",
    ". these two bands should be confronted with the horizontal gray belts . ] , which correspond to the kamland @xmath289 ( dark gray ) and @xmath293 ( light gray ) allowed intervals for @xmath12 .",
    "concerning the boron - fixed case , we see that for @xmath294 the @xmath12 value preferred by solar data is almost insensitive to @xmath14 , and in very good agreement with the kamland prediction . in this regime",
    "a non - zero value of @xmath14 leads to a mild deficit in the expected number of nc and es events , thus reducing the quality of the fit .",
    "when @xmath14 exceeds @xmath295 , this deficit become relevant , and in order to compensate it the best - fit point moves towards regions of the neutrino parameter space where the electron neutrino survival probability @xmath41 is larger . from fig .",
    "[ fig : kam - probab ] it is easy to understand that this correspond to larger values of @xmath12 . in any case , as long as @xmath296 the @xmath12 regions allowed at @xmath289 by solar and kamland data still overlap , and this explains why in this regime there is no visible difference between @xmath64 and @xmath288 .",
    "the situation is different for the boron - free case . as for the previous case , an increase of @xmath14 lead to a deficit in the expected number of nc and es events , which can now be compensated by assuming a larger value of the @xmath31 flux .",
    "however , a larger boron flux results in an excess of @xmath0 arriving at the detectors , so that now the experimental data favor regions of the parameter space where the electron neutrino survival probability @xmath41 is smaller .",
    "this explains why the preferred value for @xmath12 decreases as @xmath14 increases .",
    "when @xmath297 the favored value for the @xmath31 flux rapidly decreases , and @xmath12 increases again .",
    "a consequence of this is that already for @xmath298 the @xmath289 regions for solar and for kamland data no longer overlap .",
    "this leads to a tension between the two data sets , which results in an excess of @xmath288 over @xmath64 .",
    "it is only for very large values of @xmath14 that solar data return in agreement with kamland , and the two lines @xmath64 and @xmath288 merges again .      in summary ,",
    "in this appendix we have investigated the impact of the first 145.1 days of kamland data on the determination of the solar neutrino parameters .",
    "we have found that all non - lma solution are now ruled out , and that the original lma region is split into two relatively narrow islands around the values of @xmath300 ( best fit point ) and @xmath285 ( local minimum ) .",
    "the bound on the sterile neutrino fraction @xmath14 is practically unaffected in the boron - fixed case , but improves from @xmath191 to @xmath241 ( at 99% c.l . ) in the boron - free case .",
