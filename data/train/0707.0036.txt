    "in 1935 einstein , podolsky , and rosen ( epr ) have shown in the classical paper @xcite that quantum mechanics contradicts the natural assumption ( the `` local realism '' ) that a measurement of one of two spatially separated objects does not affect the other one .",
    "this `` spooky action at a distance ''  known as an entanglement  is now recognized as a major resource in the field of quantum information and quantum computing .",
    "@xcite the paradox has led epr to conclude that quantum mechanics is an incomplete description of physical reality , thus implying that some local hidden variables are needed .",
    "the epr paradox remained at the level of semi - philosophical discussions until 1964 , when john bell contributed an inequality for results of a spin - correlation experiment , @xcite which should hold for any theory involving local hidden variables , but is violated by quantum mechanics .",
    "inspired by bell s idea , in 1969 , clauser , horne , shimony , and holt @xcite ( chsh ) proposed a version of the bell inequality ( bi , the generic name for a family of inequalities ) , which made the experimental testing of local hidden - variable theories possible . the main advantage of the chsh inequality in comparison with the original bi is that it does not rely on an experimentally unrealistic assumption of a perfect anticorrelation between the measurement results when two spin-1/2 particles ( in the spin-0 state ) are measured along the same direction .",
    "many interesting experiments @xcite have been done since then . the results of these experiments clearly show a violation of the bell inequalities , in accordance with quantum mechanical predictions .",
    "the bi violation has been mostly demonstrated in the experiments with photons;@xcite it has been also shown in the experiments with ions in traps @xcite and with an atom - photon system ; @xcite a bell - like inequality violation has been also demonstrated in an experiment with single neutrons.@xcite experimental violation of the bi in solid - state qubits would be an important step towards practical quantum information processing by solid - state devices.@xcite experiments on observation of the bi violation in josephson phase qubits are currently underway .",
    "@xcite theoretical study related to the bi violation in solid - state systems has also attracted significant attention in recent years .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we discuss the bell inequality ( in the chsh form ) for solid - state systems , focusing on experiments with superconducting phase qubits",
    ". we study effects of various factors detrimental for observation of the bi violation , including local measurement errors , decoherence , and interaction between qubits ( crosstalk ) , and analyze optimal conditions in presence of these nonidealities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ ii ] we review the chsh type of the bi , and also discuss tomography - type measurements using qubit rotations . in sec .",
    "[ iii ] we consider the ideal case and describe all situations for which the bi is violated maximally .",
    "sections [ iv]-[vii ] are devoted to the effects of various nonidealities on the observation of the bi violation . in sec .",
    "[ iv ] we discuss the effect of local measurement errors , using a more general error model than in the previous approaches .",
    "@xcite analytical results for maximally entangled states and numerical results for general two - qubit states are presented . in sec .",
    "[ vi ] we consider the effect of local decoherence of the qubits . in sec .",
    "[ vii ] we discuss measurement crosstalk , which affects both the bi ( since crosstalk is a classical mechanism of communication between qubits ) and the quantum result .",
    "we also propose a version of the bi , which is not affected by the crosstalk .",
    "section [ viii ] provides concluding remarks .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the chsh inequality , @xcite a type of the bell inequality usually used in experiments .",
    "let us consider a pair of two - level systems ( qubits ) @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "assuming that a realistic ( classical ) theory based on local observables @xcite holds and there is no communication between the qubits ( i.e. , no crosstalk ) , the two - qubit measurement results should satisfy the chsh inequality @xcite -2s2 , where s = e(,)-e(,)+e(,)+ e(, ) . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) are the unit radius - vectors on the bloch sphere along the measurement axes for qubit @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and @xmath6 is the correlator of the measurement results : e(,)=p_++(,)+p_(,)- p_+-(,)-p_-+ ( , ) , where @xmath7 is the joint probability of measurement results @xmath8 and @xmath9 for qubits @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the sum of the probabilities in eq .",
    "equals one .",
    "this can be used to recast eq .   in the form s=4t+2 , where t = p(,)-p(,)+p(,)+ p(,)-p_a()-p_b ( ) . here",
    "@xmath10 , whereas @xmath11 [ or @xmath12 is the probability of the measurement result `` + '' for qubit @xmath0 ( or @xmath13 irrespective of the measurement result for the other qubit [ in the classical theory in absence of communication between qubits , @xmath14 is obviously independent of the direction @xmath4 and even independent of the very fact of the qubit @xmath1 measurement ; similarly for @xmath15 .",
    "thus , instead of the probabilities @xmath16 , one can equivalently use the probabilities @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 , and the inequality can be recast in an equivalent form @xcite -1t0 .",
    "notice that both inequalities and can have somewhat different meanings in different physical situations .",
    "in particular , the results `` @xmath20 '' and `` @xmath21 '' may correspond to the presence or absence of the detector `` click '' ( so called `` one - channel measurement '' @xcite ) ; in this case a low - efficiency detector significantly increases the chance of the result `` @xmath21 '' .",
    "another possibility is the so - called `` two - channel measurement '' , in which the qubit states``@xmath20 '' and `` @xmath21 '' are supposed to produce clicks in different detectors ; @xcite in this case inefficient detection leads to three possible results : `` @xmath20 '' , `` @xmath21 '' , and `` no result '' .",
    "significant inefficiency of the optical detectors leads to the so - called `` detector loophole , '' @xcite which arises because effectively not the whole ensemble of the qubit pairs is being measured .",
    "this problem is often discussed in terms of contrasting the clauser - horne @xcite ( ch ) and chsh interpretations of the inequalities , which differ by considering either the whole ensemble or a subensemble of the qubit pairs .",
    "it is important to mention that in the case of the josephson phase qubits ( which formally belongs to the class of one - channel measurements ) the whole ensemble of qubit pairs is being measured , and therefore there is no detector loophole ( if one avoids @xcite corrections for measurement errors ) , as well as there is no difference between chsh and ch interpretations .      in some cases , as for josephson phase qubits , the measurement ( detector ) axis can not be physically rotated .",
    "however , instead of the detector rotation , one can rotate the qubit state .",
    "@xcite let us show the equivalence of the two methods explicitly , using the example of the phase qubit and assuming ideal ( orthodox ) measurement .",
    "the hamiltonian of the phase qubit in a microwave field in the subspace of the two lowest states in the qubit potential well @xmath22 and @xmath23 is & h_q=&(_q/2)(|_1_1| -|_0_0| ) + & & + ( t)(t+ ) ( |_0_1|+|_1_0| ) , where @xmath24 is the planck constant , @xmath25 is the qubit resonance frequency , @xmath26 is the microwave frequency , @xmath27 is the time - dependent rabi frequency , @xmath28 is the dipole - moment matrix element , and @xmath29 is the electric - strength amplitude of the microwave field . transforming to the qubit basis ( the rotating frame ) @xmath30 , @xmath31 ,",
    "neglecting fast oscillating terms in the hamiltonian ( the rotating - wave approximation ) and assuming the resonance condition @xmath32 , we arrive at the hamiltonian h(t)= , where the unit vector @xmath33 lies in the @xmath34 plane making the angle @xmath35 with the @xmath36 axis , whereas @xmath37 is the vector of the pauli matrices .",
    "@xcite here and below we associate state @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) with the measurement result `` @xmath20 '' ( `` @xmath21 '' ) and with the eigenvalue @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) of @xmath42 , so that @xmath43 .",

    "namely , one can interpret @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) as the probability of the qubit to be found in the state with the pseudospin parallel ( antiparallel ) to the measurement axis @xmath2 .",
    "notice that the microwave phase @xmath55 is naturally defined modulo @xmath56 , while the rabi rotation angle @xmath57 can be always reduced to a @xmath56 range ( we will assume @xmath58 ) .",
    "nevertheless , with this restriction there are still two sets of angles @xmath59 corresponding to the same measurement direction @xmath2 , because @xmath2 is invariant under the change ( , ) ( -,+ ) .",
    "it is easy to make a one - to - one correspondence between the measurement direction @xmath2 and angles @xmath59 by limiting either @xmath57 or @xmath55 to a @xmath60-range ( instead of @xmath56 ) .",
    "however , we prefer not to do that because it is convenient and natural physically to have a @xmath56 range for one angle when the other angle is fixed .",

    "let us first analyze the extremum values of @xmath78 for the class of maximally entangled states ( [ 3.18 ] ) .",

    "as mentioned above , when @xmath309 , the crosstalk yields different results for @xmath238 and @xmath283 . however , recalling that the change @xmath310 occurs with the probability @xmath216 if @xmath311 and @xmath312 or with the probability @xmath217 if @xmath313 and @xmath314 , we can obtain a symmetry relation for the probability of a change of @xmath315 with a given @xmath238 to some @xmath316 as a function of @xmath216 and @xmath217 : p_a(p_c^a , p_c^b , c ) = p_a(p_c^b , p_c^a ,- c ) . to extend the results of sec .",
