    "to analyse the long - term behaviour of the non - abelian case , we draw an analogy to decoherent quantum walks by interpreting the anyonic quantum walk as a quantum walk with an environment . the fusion space is a very special kind of environment , since it is non - local and highly non - markovian , and such environments are not well studied in the literature .",
    "thus , anyonic environments open a new line of study on effects of environment and decoherence in quantum systems .",
    "disordered quantum walks have been studied in the literature recently , and localization has been observed for many types of spatial disorder in the coin parameter .",
    "linden and sharam @xcite showed that periodically varying coin parameters can lead to both bounded and unbounded walks , depending on the period .",
    "konno @xcite used path - counting methods to study quantum walks under quenched and annealed disorder , and showed that a coin defect at the origin causes partial localization of the wavepacket .",
    "joye and merkli @xcite and ahlbrecht et al @xcite showed that dynamical anderson localization occurs for spatially inhomogeneous coin , when the coin parameters are chosen randomly from continuous or certain discrete sets .",
    "if the coin parameters change in time , the walker spreads ballistically or diffusively , but no localization has been observed .",
    "brun et al @xcite studied periodically changing coins , and found that the walk is still ballistic unless the period becomes as large as the length of the walk , in which case it is diffusive .",
    "shapira et al @xcite studied quenched unitary noise numerically and observed that the walk is diffusive in the long term after an initial ballistic period .",
    "similar conclusions were drawn in analytical treatment by ahlbrecht et al @xcite and joye @xcite .    as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quantum walk is diffusive also in the presence of both temporal and spatial disorder , in other words localization does not occur in a spatially disordered system if temporal randomness is also present .",
    "the quantum coherent terms that are needed for localization in the spatially disordered case are thus destroyed by decoherence from temporal randomness .",
    "when a coin changes completely randomly , the identity of the next coin is not dependent on the previous coins at all , and the environment which induces the change has no memory .",
    "if the rate of change of the coin is larger than a single time step , there exists a markov process characterized by some time - varying parameter @xmath207 . if there is no memory at all , these constants are identical for every @xmath27 . in a markov process ,",
    "the future states of a system depend only on its present state and @xmath208 , not its history . in the following , we argue that the anyonic environment is effectively memoryless and is therefore described by a markov process , which implies that the walker spreads diffusively .",
    "equation ( [ average trace ising ] ) in the main text shows that the average trace @xmath209 of ising anyons is almost identical to that of abelian anyons , except for the term involving the milnor triple invariant @xmath210 .",
    "the milnor triple invariant gives the number of borromean rings in a three - component link .",
    "we argue that the @xmath115-term induces temporal randomness in the walk , such that the environment acts effectively in a markovian way .",
    "the effect of this term is that it multiplies the contribution from each path by the configuration average over @xmath211 .",
    "while this term preserves memory of the whole history of the particle s trajectory , we argue that at short time scales it fluctuates in a disordered manner . the value of @xmath210 changes when a new borromean ring is formed , which requires at least 4 time steps .",
    "also , the formation of a borromean ring requires a very specific pattern in the particle s trajectory which is in no way periodic .",
    "in addition , because of the condition on the last coin outcomes @xmath212 , there are new path patterns up to @xmath213 time steps introduced on every time step which were not allowed for the previous time step , so these paths are not correlated to previous evolution at all .",
    "the time correlations of the @xmath210 invariant can be tracked by defining the correlator @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the sum of three - component invariants for all sublinks for a path up to @xmath27 time steps and @xmath216 is the expectation value over all paths leading to the initial site @xmath217 ( the subindex has been suppressed above for clarity ) .",
    "the term in the denominator is a normalization factor , which is defined to be the value of the term in the numerator in the perfectly correlated case @xmath218 . for simplicity",
    ", the correlator is calculated only for the uniform filling ( @xmath219 ) using the same method as described in @xcite .",
    "the time correlations can be analysed by keeping the final time @xmath27 fixed and calculating the correlator for increasing values of @xmath220 .",
    "the intermediate time value @xmath221 is calculated by erasing the @xmath220 last braid generators from the total braid word , such that braiding is switched off after @xmath222 time steps .",
    "for some braid words , the quantity @xmath101 is not well defined in our method , in which case we set @xmath223 .",
    "the correlator for @xmath224 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : taucorrelator ] , which shows that the correlations fall off exponentially after one step , indicating that effectively the @xmath210 invariant maintains memory only for a short period of time , and the environment is markovian at long time scales .",
    "note that because of the condition @xmath212 , the braiding at the last time step can always be trivially undone , therefore the last two time steps are perfectly correlated .",
    "the correlator can also be calculated for other sites @xmath225 . in these cases ,",
    "the rapid falloff is observed for the central region @xmath226 , and outside this region the falloff becomes linear at the furthest edge sites .",
    "the edge behaviour is however irrelevant , as the behaviour of the quantum walk is determined by the central region only .     as a function of @xmath220 with total number of time steps @xmath224",
    "the line shows the best exponential fit @xmath227 . ]",
    "the fundamental reason for the classical - like behaviour of the walker is the strong entanglement between the quantum walk states and the fusion states , and the highly mixing nature of the fusion space environment .",
    "the walker states stay entangled with the fusion states for long time periods , and recurrences where these states become uncoupled happen very rarely .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of temporally random phases introduced to the spatially random abelian walk . in this model",
    "the wave function is multiplied by a random -1 phase with some probability @xmath228 if the walker crosses a site belonging to the temporally fluctuating region of sites .",
    "the calculations with different values of @xmath228 and different sizes of the region up to 500 time steps showed that the behaviour becomes diffusive in all these cases .",
    "we have calculated numerically the average variance @xmath229 over configurations @xmath119 for the probability distribution given by eqs .",
    "( [ fixed configuration distribution ] ) and ( [ ising fusion trace ] ) up to 23 time steps ( 46 anyons in the lattice ) , with at least 100 charge configurations .",
    "the error bars were obtained by the standard deviation of the variance of the spatial probability distribution .",
    "the average variance is approximately a straight line with slope 0.456 from 10 to 23 time steps , but the error bars of the variance overlap with the errorbars of the abelian case , so we can not distinguish between abelian and non - abelian anyons on this short time scale . considering only occupations @xmath230 ( no vacuum charges ) ,",
    "the variance is smaller , ie .",
    "the wave packet is diffusing slower ( not shown ) .    to obtain results for longer times",
    ", we turn to the continuous - time picture where the time evolution is generated by a hubbard - type hamiltonian @xmath231 and the propagator @xmath232 implements an infinitesimal time evolution . the total hamiltonian is given by the sum of the shift and coin flip terms @xmath233 , where @xcite @xmath234 @xmath235 with @xmath236 and @xmath237 are translation operators between sites @xmath1 and @xmath238 , @xmath239 are braid generators as defined in the main text for braiding the mobile anyone around anyons in the island between @xmath1 and @xmath240 ( acting on fusion space only ) and @xmath241 are projectors to the coin states . here",
    "@xmath242 corresponds to occupation of state @xmath243 at site @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath244 corresponds to no mobile anyon at site @xmath1 , @xmath245 is a mobile anyon with coin state @xmath246 at site @xmath1 . here",
    "we consider only the case where coins are identical on every site .",
    "the above hamiltonian is the generator of continuous - time evolution for total time @xmath15 .",
    "running the continuous - time walk for time @xmath15 simulates the discrete - time quantum walk in a stroboscopic manner , such that the walker makes @xmath247 steps of infinitesimal length @xmath248 : @xmath249 . in the first order of suzuki - trotter expansion",
    ", the propagator decomposes to @xmath250 , similarly as the single step operator in the discrete - time quantum walk model .",
    "the tebd algorithm was used to perform real time evolution of an initial state with the mobile anyon placed at the middle of the lattice and with couplings @xmath251 .",
    "our implementation of the tebd algorithm explicitly preserves anyonic charge @xcite and also particle number @xcite corresponding to the presence of a single walker .",
    "thus , while the position of the walker and the fusion degrees of freedom of the anyons are entangled during the time evolution , the algorithm preserves distinction between them .",
    "this in turn allowed for specification of total anyonic charge and particle number , here we considered the total vacuum sector with one walker .",

    "<S> incoming light undergoes a series of scattering events and eventually localises due to the randomness in phases that individual trajectories accumulate during their passage between consecutive scatterers . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial randomness can be translated into a disorder in the population of the islands in the anyonic quantum walk model . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , reflection and transmission coefficients of the scatterers can be identified with the entries of the coin operator . </S>",
    "<S> the scatterer distances take discrete and finite many values reflecting the discrete nature in the populations of the islands . </S>",
    "<S> localisation of the walking abelian anyon then follows , with the localisation length @xmath83 . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , in appendix [ sec : scattering model ] we derive the bound @xmath84 where the anyonic statistical angle @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> this theoretical result is in agreement with exact numerical treatment presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : abelian ] .    </S>",
    "<S> _ ising non - abelian anyons:- _ we consider the ising model of non - abelian anyons . </S>",
    "<S> there are three kinds of particles in this model : vacuum , fermion , and non - abelian anyon . in analogy with @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the initial fusion state @xmath65 describes the vacuum configuration of pairs of anyons with half the members braided to the right . here </S>",
    "<S> , they randomly populate islands ( except for the walker ) to form a disordered background configuration @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the braid generators @xmath21 are now unitary matrices , the dimension of which grows like @xmath86 , where @xmath87 , and @xmath88 is the _ quantum dimension _ of ising anyons .    </S>",
    "<S> the trace over the fusion degree of freedom can be related to the kauffman bracket polynomial @xmath89 @xcite of a link @xmath90 , which arises from the markov closure of the braid word @xmath91 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , @xmath89 can be expressed in terms of the jones polynomial @xmath92 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> altogether , @xmath93 where the _ writhe _ @xmath94 . for ising anyons , which correspond to spin-@xmath95 irreps of the quantum group @xmath96 we have specifically @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> in this case @xmath98 can be further simplified in terms of simple topological characteristics of the link @xmath90 ( see appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> our final result for @xmath67 reads @xmath99 where @xmath100 and @xmath101 is the milnor triple invariant of a three - component sublink of @xmath90 formed by strands corresponding to the walker and the islands @xmath102 and @xmath103 . </S>",
    "<S> ( we do not explicitly indicate the @xmath49-dependence of the right hand side . ) for the case of uniform background configuration we recover the case studied in @xcite .    to illustrate the role of disorder in a non - abelian anyonic quantum walk , we choose uniform island occupation probabilities . as ( [ ising fusion trace ] ) </S>",
    "<S> is for @xmath104 @xmath105-periodic in @xmath2 we take @xmath106 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 otherwise @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the configuration average of ( [ ising fusion trace ] ) can be partially carried through , as shown in appendix . </S>",
    "<S> the average position distribution of the ising quantum walk after @xmath27 steps , @xmath109 , is given by ( [ average position distribution ] ) with average fusion space trace @xmath110 where @xmath111 can be interpreted as an arithmetic mean of the quantity @xmath112 taken over all sublinks @xmath113 of a link @xmath90 . on comparing ( [ average trace ising ] ) to the abelian expression ( [ average trace abelian ] ) for @xmath114 , they are identical except for the prefactor @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> considering eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ average trace abelian ] ) as the coherent expression where the quantum interference of probability amplitudes causes localisation , the @xmath115 coefficient can be viewed as a noise term which might or might not destroy the interference . in the supplementary material , we argue that at short time scales , this term does not preserve memory and introduces temporal randomness . by results of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , localisation does not occur in the presence of both spatial and temporal randomness , therefore we conjecture that non - abelian anyons do not localise in the asymptotic limit @xmath116 .     </S>",
    "<S> sized lattice . here is shown : variance of an abelian anyon with @xmath117 exchange statistics around a uniform background of islands singly occupied by abelian anyons ( uniform abelian = ua ) , variance of a ising model anyon around a uniform background @xmath118 of ising anyons ( uniform non - abelian = una ) , variance of an ising model anyon around a random background of islands where the distribution in each is uniform over @xmath119 ising anyons and averaging is taken over 50 background configurations ( random non - abelian = rna ) , and variance of the abelian anyon averaged over at least @xmath120 background configurations of abelian anyons with occupation probability uniform over @xmath80 ( random abelian = ra ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( b ) variance of anyons in a hubbard model on a ladder realising a continuous time anyonic quantum walk over an @xmath121 sized lattice . here </S>",
    "<S> space and time axes are scaled so that a continuous time classical diffusion would have diffusion coefficient providing @xmath122 . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic slope for the case rna averaged in the same way as in ( a ) is @xmath123 and the slope remains positive and less than one within one sigma variance ( error bars suppressed for clarity ) . </S>",
    "<S> numerics are obtained using an approximate method employing real time evolution of an anyonic mps with bond dimension equal to 100 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> we have also performed numerical calculations for non - abelian anyons using two methods . </S>",
    "<S> first , the probability distribution was calculated using eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fixed configuration distribution ] ) and ( [ ising fusion trace ] ) up to 23 time steps ( see inset of fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : variancenonab1 ] ) , but it is hard to determine from these results whether localisation occurs or not . to obtain results for longer time scales , we used a hubbard model @xcite on a ladder realising a continuous time anyonic quantum walk for an @xmath121 sized lattice with open ( reflecting ) boundaries . </S>",
    "<S> these results were obtained by using the `` time - evolving block decimation '' ( tebd ) @xcite algorithm that is based on matrix product states ( mps ) . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : variancenonab1 ] shows that for non - abelian anyons the variance grows linearly as a function of time , indicating no signature of localisation .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions:- _ </S>",
    "<S> a new characteristic of statistical behaviour has been presented in terms of the localisation properties of anyons . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated that abelian anyons propagating in an environment of other anyons of the same type in random positions , localise , regardless of their mutual anyonic statistics . to prove this we demonstrated that localisation can occur not only in the presence of a continuous random variable , but also of discrete , where the localisation length is tightly determined . </S>",
    "<S> for the non - abelian case we considered the ising anyonic model . </S>",
    "<S> we showed that it fails to localise due to the entanglement of the walker with its environment that can be effectively described as dephasing of the walk leading to linear dispersion . </S>",
    "<S> this argument is supported by exact numerical results for a small number of walk steps and by an approximate numerical method that employs matrix product states . </S>",
    "<S> we expect delocalisation to occur even for more general @xmath124 non - abelian anyons due to the entanglement of the walker with the environment . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in @xcite it has been demonstrated that the entanglement of the walker with its uniform environment for any @xmath125 is strong enough to cause the walk to decohere obtaining eventually a classical diffusive behaviour .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , our study provides a new paradigm of disorder that has the ability to override the localisation properties of quasiparticles with anyonic statistics . in a real system with random potentials </S>",
    "<S> abelian anyons that do not localise due to the potentials can be localised just by the presence of a random anyonic environment . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> non - abelian anyons that would localise due to some random potential can be delocalised if a random background of anyons of the same type is present .    </S>",
