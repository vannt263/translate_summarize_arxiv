    "the 1990 october launch of ulysses and the subsequent polar passes in late 1994 , 1995 , 2000 and 2001 have provided a wealth of new data and insights concerning solar polar coronal holes and the fast solar wind emanating from them . the south polar pass of 1994 ( during solar minimum ) highlighted a particular problem concerning the charge states observed in various elements in the fast wind , which are generally characteristic of higher temperatures than observed spectroscopically in coronal holes .",
    "coronal holes show very little emission in spectral lines corresponding to plasma temperatures of @xmath2 k or greater ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas @xcite find freeze - in temperatures from the o , si and fe charge states in the range @xmath3 k. fe in the fast solar wind is dominated by charge states fe@xmath4 and fe@xmath5 , whereas lines from fe x , xi , and xii are generally not detectable in spectroscopy of coronal holes ; an old result going back to @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite recognized that the electron temperature must increase outwards as the fast wind flows out of the coronal hole , and were able to derive a empirical temperature profile , but did not specify a mechanism to produce such an effect .",
    "the heuristic temperature profile of @xcite predicts a maximum in the electron temperature of about @xmath6 k relatively close to the solar surface , at about @xmath7 heliocentric distance .",
    "however observations in a temperature diagnostic line ratio in mg  ix @xcite out to @xmath8 with the sumer instrument on soho failed to detect such a temperature increase .",
    "consequently , in a series of papers @xcite , the effects of a halo electron distribution ( i.e. a power law tail on the core maxwellian ) that remains consistent with sumer electron temperature measurements and differential flows between ions of the same element were investigated . while carefully chosen differential flows can explain most of the in situ charge state observations without the need for extra electron heating , the required speed differentials are so large as to be implausible , leaving electron heating as the most likely explanation .",
    "the fast solar wind is often observed ( at 1 au ) with @xmath9 @xcite and with @xmath10 , and this electron temperature anisotropy can be described in term of a core maxwellian distribution and a halo higher temperature maxwellian or power law distribution , which contains typically 5% of the electrons @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that this halo distribution persists all the way back to the sun @xcite , and this might be appealing since the electron temperature diagnostic used by @xcite ( mg ix ) belongs to an isoelectronic sequence that is in general insensitive to such a population @xcite , whereas the ionization balance is not .",
    "however the o vi diagnostic used by @xcite should be sensitive to suprathermal electrons but shows no evidence of their existence out to 1.3 @xmath1 . in any case , it seems that such an explanation must fail , because the halo distribution will transfer energy to the core maxwellian by coulomb collisions on a timescale @xmath11 s , ( @xmath12 is the electron temperature in @xmath2k , and @xmath13 is the electron density in @xmath14 ) and even with the fastest inferred outflow speeds , the solar wind would not get very far before a discernable increase in the core maxwellian electron temperature should become apparent .",
    "the acceleration of the fast solar wind is widely believed to occur through ion cyclotron waves , though the manner in which they are excited remains controversial .",
    "the original concept , that low frequency waves alone are sufficient to accelerate the fast solar wind to its eventual speed of 700 - 800 km s@xmath15 , appears to be adequate for acceleration of protons but not for the minor ions @xcite , which in this case would be accelerated mainly by the coulomb drag of the protons .",
    "hence minor ions should flow out of the coronal hole with lower speeds than the protons .",
    "renewed indications that ion cyclotron waves are required come from the uvcs doppler dimming measurements of the o@xmath16 outflow velocity , which are _ large _ compared to hydrogen , @xmath17 km s@xmath15 at 2.5 - 3.0 @xmath1 heliocentric distance .",
    "by contrast a purely low frequency wave driven outflow would produce o@xmath16 outflow velocities of less than 100 km s@xmath15 at this distance .",
    "similar indications come from the observation in the fast solar wind of faster flow speeds for @xmath0 particles ( and in fact all minor ions ) than for protons with ulysses and helios @xcite .",
    "the ulysses and helios observations only go in to the sun as far as @xmath18 heliocentric distance , but the inference that @xmath0 particles flow out from the sun at least as fast as protons in the fast solar wind may be extended to lower altitudes by spectroscopic observations with sumer of the he abundance @xcite . here he abundances at or below the usual fast solar wind value of 5% relative to h are found , implying flow speeds at these lower altitudes at or above the h flow speed to keep the flux of @xmath0 particles constant .",
    "this is also consistent with recent modelling by @xcite , where by heating primarily the @xmath0 particles , a steep transition region , hot corona and fast wind can be created by high frequency alfvn waves propagating up from the coronal base . on the other hand @xcite and @xcite argue that the high frequency ( or ion cyclotron ) waves that accelerate the fast wind must be generated throughout the extended corona , due to their rapid dissipation once generated , and the observation that ions continue to be heated in the range @xmath19 heliocentric distance .",
    "we propose an entirely new ( to the fast wind ; though see * ? ? ?",
    "* for related considerations ) means of heating / accelerating electrons . at a heliocentric distance between 1.5 and 2 @xmath1 , the perpendicular _ velocities _ of the minor ions",
    "start to exceed those of the protons .",
    "there are also indications from observations that @xmath0 particles are similarly heated .",
    "all these ions will have significantly larger gyroradii than the protons . in the presence of a density gradient",
    ", these ions may then excite lower hybrid waves in the colder protons .",
    "this requires that the electron gyroradius be less than the wavelength/2@xmath20 .",
    "the waves will damp by heating electrons in a direction parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "unless other restrictions set in , the waves ultimately will saturate once the electrons are heated such that their gyroradii are no longer sufficiently small . in the region of interest",
    "the plasma conditions are approximately magnetic field @xmath21 g and density @xmath22 @xmath14 .",
    "then the proton and electron gyrofrequencies are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and the lower hybrid frequency is @xmath25 ( all in rad s@xmath15 ) .",
    "the electron and proton plasma frequencies are @xmath26 and @xmath27",
    ". it will turn out that waves are excited at low @xmath28 by ions moving with velocities greater than the proton thermal speed , so the limit @xmath29 of the plasma dispersion function is appropriate , and that @xmath0 particles will be species most important for the wave generation .",
    "this is due to their large gyroradius compared to protons and their high abundance compared to other minor ions .",
    "lower hybrid waves are electrostatic ion oscillations , which can occur in magnetic fields strong enough that the electron gyroradius is smaller than the lower hybrid wavelength@xmath30 . due to this necessary magnetization of the electrons ,",
    "the waves propagate preferentially across magnetic field lines .",
    "the parallel component of the wavevector @xmath31 . since @xmath32",
    "the wave can simultaneously be in resonance with ions moving across the magnetic field and electrons moving along magnetic field lines , which facilitates collisionless energy exchange between ions and electrons on timescales much faster than that associated with coulomb collisions .",
    "they have also been discussed in connection with cometary x - ray emission , electron acceleration in solar flares , supernova remnant shock waves and advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) @xcite , and observed in situ together with accelerated electrons at halley s comet @xcite . a cold plasma theory for lower - hybrid waves",
    "is given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "here we summarize the theory with finite electron and ion temperatures .",
    "the dispersion relation is ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and @xmath37 is the usual plasma dispersion function ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 are electron and ion temperatures and masses respectively and @xmath40 is boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "specializing to @xmath29 and @xmath41 , so that @xmath42 and @xmath43 and taking @xmath44 and @xmath45 , @xmath46.\\ ] ]    the instability is illustrated schematically in figure 1 .",
    "the density is increasing towards the right , and the density gradient is perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "a local anisotropy in the ion distribution develops in the direction formed by the cross product of density gradient and magnetic field , which in the representation of figure 1 is into or out of the page .",
    "this is similar to a scenario envisaged by @xcite , who were interested in electron - ion equilibration in two temperature accretion flows .",
    "we consider the effect of a density gradient in a uniform magnetic field .",
    "in such a situation the ion distribution function is given by @xmath47 where the magnetic field @xmath48 , and the density gradient @xmath49 is related to @xmath50 by @xmath51 .",
    "we consider the growth of lower hybrid waves in the protons excited by minor ions with large gyroradii .",
    "the growth rate for each minor ion species is given by @xcite @xmath52 \\exp\\left ( -{\\omega ^2\\over 2k^2v_{th\\perp}^2}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 is the angle between @xmath54 and @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 is the product of the element abundance , ionization fraction and charge squared of the particular ions that excite the wave , divided by their mass in atomic mass units .",
    "protons are expected to have insufficiently large gyroradii to excite lower - hybrid waves , and so the factor @xmath57 favors @xmath0-particles over other minor ions in the wave generation . the term @xmath58 in the square brackets represents the ion landau damping given by the imaginary part of the expression for @xmath59 in equation 2 .",
    "equation 4 is similar to equation ( 3.20 ) in @xcite , with the identification of their drift velocity @xmath60 , and in their case @xmath61 .",
    "their treatment yields waves at much higher @xmath28 than ours does , since they consider a single ion distribution drifting with velocity @xmath62 producing waves at @xmath63 , whereas we treat the effect at a single point of a continuum of different maxwellians with differing densities ( but otherwise the same ) producing waves at @xmath64 .",
    "this difference is appropriate in view of the fact that they are interested in plasmas with ion pressure @xmath65 magnetic pressure @xmath65 electron pressure where the plasma itself amplifies the magnetic field , while here we are concerned with magnetic pressure @xmath65 ion and electron pressures where the magnetic field is imposed externally .",
    "@xcite also considered the effects of magnetic curvature .",
    "we assume that the necessary gradients in magnetic field are much less likely to exist in the low @xmath66 plasma of the solar coronal hole .",
    "we find the wavevector @xmath67 where the growth rate is maximized in the direction perpendicular to @xmath54 ( i.e. @xmath68 ) , and the maximum growth rate itself , which is plotted in units of @xmath69 in figure 2 .",
    "if the waves are driven to marginal stability @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the perpendicular ion velocity , equation 1 can be written @xmath72 at saturation where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , and putting @xmath75 , @xmath76 this is a quadratic equation for @xmath77 which has lowest order solution @xmath78 the kinetic growth rate varies as @xmath79 , @xcite and averaging @xmath77 over this growth rate gives @xmath80 .",
    "thus in principle electron and ion temperatures can equilibrate ( assuming that @xmath81 ) , in the sense that the waves do not saturate before this is achieved .",
    "we use an adaptation of the blasphemer ( blast propagation in highly emitting environment ) code @xcite , which follows the time dependent ionization balance and temperatures of a lagrangian plasma parcel as it expands in the solar wind .",
    "the density @xmath82 of ions of element @xmath83 with charge @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 where @xmath86 are the rates for electron impact ionization , radiative recombination and dielectronic recombination respectively , out of the charge state @xmath84 .",
    "these rates are the same as those used in the recent ionization balance calculations of @xcite , using subroutines kindly supplied by dr p. mazzotta ( private communication 2000 ) .",
    "the electron density @xmath13 is determined from the condition that the plasma be electrically neutral .",
    "the ion and electron temperatures , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are coupled by coulomb collisions by @xmath89 and @xmath90 here @xmath91 is the atomic mass of the ions of element @xmath83 and charge @xmath84 in the plasma , and @xmath92 is the coulomb logarithm .",
    "the term in @xmath93 represents plasma energy losses due to ionization and radiation .",
    "radiation losses can be taken from @xcite , though are generally negligible in applications to the solar wind .",
    "the term @xmath94 gives the reduction in electron temperature when the electron density increases due to ionization .",
    "recombinations , which reduce the electron density , do not result in an increase in the electron temperature in low density plasmas , since the energy of the recombined electron is radiated away ( in either radiative or dielectronic recombination ) , rather than being shared with the other plasma electrons as would be the case for three - body recombination in dense plasmas .",
    "the last terms in equations 9 and 10 represent collisionless ion - electron energy transfer , which we estimate assuming that the population of lower hybrid waves is approximately steady state .",
    "then the wave growth rate due to the gyrating ions is equal to the wave landau damping rate due to the electrons , and the energy transfer rate is given by @xmath95 in ergs @xmath14s@xmath15 where @xmath96 is the wave energy density in terms of the wave peak electric field @xmath97 .",
    "a threshold electric field for lower hybrid waves between the linear and stochastic regimes has been determined by @xcite by numerical integration of the hamiltonian equations of motion , and also analytically using an ion trapping argument , to be @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the background magnetic field and @xmath100 is the proton gyrofrequency .",
    "this field marks the onset of proton heating as well as electron heating by the waves .",
    "we take @xmath101 ( probably a conservative assumption ) . writing the electron heating rate in terms of both collisional and collisionless processes , with @xmath102 and dropping the @xmath84 subscript in specializing to one ion species alone , @xmath103 where @xmath67 is the wavevector where the growth rate is maximized , and @xmath104 since @xmath105 . in our calculations",
    "we modify @xmath106 from its usual value to account for the collisionless energy transfer between @xmath0-particles and electrons , its new value being given by @xmath107 the quantity @xmath108 being plotted in figure 2 .",
    "the same value is applied to electron heating by other minor ions , and the original value of @xmath109 is kept for proton - electron energy transfer . in the region of the solar wind around @xmath110 heliocentric distance , where @xmath111 k , @xmath112 g ,",
    "@xmath113 @xmath14 and @xmath114 for @xmath0-particles of around 5% abundance relative to protons , the electron heating rate is increased typically by factors of order 100 - 1000 over that due solely to coulomb collisions with ions heavier than h.    we use the analytic model of @xcite for the magnetic field strength .",
    "we take the perpendicular velocity for all ions heavier than h from the empirical model for o vi ( model b2 ; equation 28 ) in @xcite in the range @xmath115 . below this",
    "we interpolate between values of 20 km s@xmath15 on the solar surface and 84 km s@xmath15 at @xmath110 .",
    "the flow speed is linearly interpolated between its initial value at the solar surface and 130 km s@xmath15 at @xmath116 , a value determined by @xcite . above @xmath116 the flow speed is allowed to evolve according the the action of the adiabatic invariant in the diverging magnetic field with the perpendicular velocity specified as above , and above @xmath117 the perpendicular velocity is also allowed to evolve in this manner , rather than being determined by the fits in @xcite .",
    "the resulting flow speed is a very good match to the empirical models b1 and b2 in @xcite , as shown in figure 3 for various values of the initial flow speed , determined to be in the range 3 - 60 km s@xmath15 by various authors @xcite .",
    "figure 4 shows the electron density in the simulations for initial flow speeds between 5 and 60 km s@xmath15 , compared with measurements using a diagnostic line ratio in si viii by @xcite and from uvcs polarization brightness observations given by @xcite .",
    "an initial flow speed of around 10 - 20 km s@xmath15 appears to be the best match to the various observations .",
    "equations 8 - 10 are integrated following the solar wind out from an initial position at @xmath118 out to around @xmath119 by which time charge states are frozen in .",
    "each model follows h , he , and one minor ion , c , o , mg , si , or fe in the present work , with fractional abundances 0.83 , 0.16 and 0.01 respectively by mass . the initial electron and ion temperatures are @xmath120 k , which also establish the initial ionization balance . the density at this point is taken to be @xmath121 @xmath14 .",
    "after each time step in the ionization balance , the densities and electron temperature are modified according to the adiabatic expansion of the solar wind governed by the magnetic field geometry and the wind velocity as specified above .",
    "figure 5 shows the electron temperature profile resulting from simulations with an initial flow speed of 10 km s@xmath15 and various values of the lower hybrid growth rate , which depends on the density gradient assumed . for reference ,",
    "the temperature measurements of @xcite using the mg ix 750  /706  diagnostic line ratio are also given .",
    "the error bar on the points at 1.3 and @xmath122 are estimated here from the scatter in the points on figure 8 of @xcite .",
    "these authors use the atomic physics data of @xcite to derive a temperature ratio , which is consistent with coronal hole temperatures determined by other authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "more recent calculations in r - matrix and distorted wave approximations summarized by @xcite give temperatures significantly higher or lower respectively , and are likely due to inaccuracies in these atomic data .",
    "we base our coronal hole temperatures on works such as @xcite and @xcite where the ionization balance is the principal temperature diagnostic , and on the o vi observations of @xcite , whose electron temperature diagnostic depends on much less controversial atomic physics .",
    "even if the absolute temperatures measured by @xcite can not be interpreted with confidence , as they state in their paper , at least the maximum variation of the electron temperature with distance from the solar surface can be constrained by their observations .",
    "figure 6 shows the electron temperature profiles resulting from using the maximum collisionless energy transfer in figure 5 and differing initial flow speeds , with the highest temperatures resulting from the slowest initial speeds since more time is available for the plasma electron to be heated and the rate of temperature decrease due to adiabatic expansion is lower .",
    "figures 7 , 8 , and 9 show the evolution of the ionization balances of o , si , and fe with heliocentric distance . in each case",
    "the flow starts at a density of @xmath121 electrons @xmath14 and a temperature of @xmath120 k. the initial flow speed is 20 km s@xmath15 and the electron - ion equilibration parameter is @xmath123 .",
    "increased ionization commences at around @xmath110 , in response to the onset of ion cyclotron heating at this location , and charge states freeze in between 2 and @xmath124 at the values found in situ by ulysses @xcite .",
    "the resulting ionization balances are given in tables 1 - 4 for c , o , mg , si and fe respectively . from the c and o ionization balances in table 1 , it is clear than only for values of the parameter @xmath125 and initial wind speeds of 10 - 20 does sufficient electron heating occur to bring the modelled charge states into agreement with those observed .",
    "tables 2 - 4 verify that these conclusions do not change when other elements mg , si , and fe are considered .",
    "we will discuss the significance of @xmath126 below . before doing so we remark on the other salient features of the model .",
    "the data of @xcite come from a high speed stream observed closer to the ecliptic plane than the polar observations of @xcite , and so are slightly less highly ionized as would be expected .",
    "even so , both sets of observations for the parameters discussed above agree very well with the modelled charge state fractions for c , o , si and fe , at least for the two or three charge states that dominate the distributions . mg is still observed to be more highly charged than the models predict .",
    "however we note that the steady state ionization balance for mg changes dramatically in the temperature range @xmath120 k to @xmath127 k @xcite , and so we anticipate that small changes in either the model or the atomic data for mg would also bring this element into agreement .",
    "we find no need to invoke different outward flow speeds for the different elements .",
    "c , o , mg , si , and fe all flow at the flow speeds determined from o vi doppler dimming measurements .",
    "this is in contrast with the work of @xcite , where heavier ions needed to flow out at successively lower speeds , as would be the case in a thermal conduction driven wind .",
    "in addition to a faster outflow , we also model higher electron temperatures , as would be expected since less time is available before freeze - in , and so higher electron temperatures are required to produce the necessary ionization .",
    "even so , the electron temperatures modelled here when extrapolated out to 0.3 - 1 a.u . are still considerably lower than those measured _ in situ _ by helios @xcite",
    ". the inclusion of non - zero thermal conduction ( see below ) might reduce this discrepancy , but it would seem that the conclusion of @xcite that `` electron temperature profiles in high - speed streams clearly indicated and even required the existence of heating sources other than the one related to the degradation of the electron heat flux '' supports our idea of electron heating .",
    "we also remark that @xcite made some different choices of atomic data .",
    "in particular their choice of o@xmath128 ionization rate from @xcite is lower than the rate adopted here from @xcite by a factor of about 0.7 , and elsewhere in the literature ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) rates for this process can be greater than that of @xcite by nearly a factor of 2 .",
    "the assessment and validation of atomic data is a huge task , beyond the scope of the current paper ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but clearly central to further quantitative development along the lines suggested in this paper .",
    "further variations in the atomic rates involved may come from nonthermal electron distributions . throughout this paper",
    "we have taken a maxwellian electron distribution , tacitly assuming that the electron - electron collision rate is sufficiently fast to maintain such conditions .",
    "we argued above that halo electron distributions are unlikely to exist close to the sun because of this collisional equilibration , and numerical estimates suggest that only at electron densities @xmath129 @xmath14 could a nonthermal electron distribution produced by lower hybrid waves survive ( by equating the collisional equilibration rate with the wind expansion rate ) .",
    "such densities are only found at or beyond the radial position where ion charge states freeze in , and so nonthermal electrons appear unlikely to produce a significant change to our charge state results , given the other current observational constraints .",
    "however lower hybrid waves do appear to be a viable means for producing the electron distributions observed in the fast solar wind .",
    "the determination that @xmath130 is necessary to produce the observed charge states requires the existence of density gradients in the fast wind with scale lengths on the order of the @xmath0-particle gyroradius , which is about 0.1 km at 1.5 @xmath1 .",
    "radio scintillation observations demonstrating the existence of such size scales in the solar wind in the ecliptic plane have rather a long history ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these are found perpendicular to the magnetic field , with larger size scales ( typically a factor of 10 within 6 @xmath1 , becoming more isotropic at larger distances ) inferred along the radial direction . @xcite",
    "inferred values of @xmath131 in polar regions at solar minimum to be around 1/10 to 1/15 of that observed in equatorial regions , but due to a lack of knowledge of @xmath13 in polar regions , were unable to say anything about the variation of @xmath132 .",
    "the density measurements reviewed in this paper indicate electron densities in polar regions a factor of 1/2 to 1/3 of those in equatorial regions , making @xmath132 in polar regions of similar order to , but still slightly smaller than that in equatorial regions .",
    "absolute values of @xmath132 in coronal hole regions of interest here have been determined observationally by @xcite to be from 0.1 to a few times 0.1 .",
    "this is smaller than the value @xmath133 tacitly assumed here , the consequence of which is discussed further below .",
    "@xcite present more data on the transition from anisotropy inside 5 - 6 @xmath1 on scales of order 10 km to isotropy further out , concluding that a real change in the microstructure rather than in alfvn wave turbulence takes place , again with reference to the ecliptic plane .",
    "@xcite review these interplanetary scintillation observations together with ulysses observations to constrain the high speed wind structure near its coronal base , and argue that the plasma is `` sufficiently structured to relax through generation of a drift - wave instability that results in electrostatic waves having @xmath28-vectors oriented perpendicular to b '' , which is precisely the motivation for the current work .",
    "@xcite go further and show that within 6 @xmath1 large scale turbulence is isotropic with a kolmogorov spectrum ( structure function @xmath134 ) , while smaller scale turbulence shows anisotropy with higher structure functions ( @xmath135 scale ) than kolmogorov turbulence would predict .",
    "the scale at which this transition takes place which can be interpreted @xcite as the size of the flux tube in which the wind flows , is inferred to be of order 1 km close to the sun .    in a study of electrostatic ion cyclotron wave generation by global resonant mhd modes",
    ", @xcite suggests that structures may exist with scales down to the proton inertial length @xmath136 , which is of the same order of magnitude as the structures already inferred by @xcite , and in terms of particle gyroradii about an order of magnitude larger than our present inference .",
    "however our evaluation of the lower hybrid wave growth rate assumed maxwellian distributions for the minor ions . in the presence of a radiation field interacting with the ions ,",
    "@xcite show that a `` kappa '' distribution may result ; @xmath137 ^{-\\kappa},\\ ] ] where @xmath138 is the thermal velocity , @xmath139 is the usual gamma function , and @xmath140 is a parameter representing the deviation from a maxwellian distribution , which is obtained in the limit @xmath141 .",
    "observations of the @xmath0-particle distribution function in the high speed solar wind generally give @xmath142 @xcite . in figures 10 and 11",
    "we plot the dimensionless lower hybrid growth rate @xmath108 and the parameter @xmath143 against @xmath144 . from figure 11",
    "it may be seen the for @xmath145 values of @xmath144 up to about 7 give acceptable ionization and for lower @xmath140 even higher @xmath144 would be tolerable",
    ". protons in a kappa distribution may also be able to contribute to the wave generation , reducing the requirement on @xmath144 even more . given the relatively safe assumption that the @xmath146 value for @xmath0-particles in the coronal hole is similar to or less than that observed in high speed wind streams at about 1 a.u .",
    ", we conclude that similar density gradients to those proposed by @xcite would provide sufficient lower hybrid wave generation and electron heating to produce the observed ionization states of minor ions in the fast wind .",
    "thus these observations provide further support for the mechanism of ion cyclotron wave generation throughout the extended corona proposed by @xcite , that of a global resonant mhd mode driving a cross field current in the resonant layer which then excites electrostatic ion cyclotron waves .",
    "we have also made rather conservative assumptions concerning the collisionless ion - electron energy transfer .",
    "higher wave electric fields than given by equation 11 ( up to @xmath147 ) are certainly possible @xcite , though as the wave amplitude increases from this point , protons begin to be heated as well as electrons ( the _ stochastic _ regime ) . under favorable conditions ,",
    "the ion heating rate may be similar to the electron heating rate .",
    "thus our estimate of the ion - electron equipartition rate may be an underestimate by as much as an order of magnitude , if the wave electric field can be a factor of a few higher , and the electron landau damping rate only reduced by a factor 0.5 .",
    "fuller discussion of this point is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the approach taken in this paper of following a lagrangian plasma element out through the solar wind acceleration region neglects thermal conduction . here",
    "we argue that such an approximation is most likely justified .",
    "the electron temperature gradient is @xmath148 k cm@xmath15 between 1 and 2 @xmath1 and @xmath150 k cm@xmath15 for heliocentric distances greater than @xmath151 .",
    "the spitzer - harm heat flux is then @xmath152 ergs @xmath153s@xmath15 prior to the temperature maximum ( for an initial flow speed of 5 km s@xmath15 ; it is lower for initial speeds of 10 and 20 km s@xmath15 ) directed back towards the sun , and oppositely directed and about an order of magnitude lower once the wind has passed the temperature maximum .",
    "the cooling rate of the plasma occupying a length of order @xmath1 between 2 and 2 @xmath1 heliocentric distance is then @xmath154 s@xmath15 , assuming an average electron density in this region of @xmath155 @xmath14 .",
    "this cooling rate is much faster than that due to adiabatic expansion , @xmath148 s@xmath15 .",
    "however in steep temperature gradients and collisionless plasma the spitzer - harm thermal conductivity is not appropriate .",
    "we estimate the collisionless heat conduction as follows : @xcite give the electron velocity diffusion coefficient in the `` moderately non - linear regime '' ( i.e. corresponding to the turbulence level just before ion trapping sets in ) as @xmath156 putting @xmath157 and using equation 11 we find @xmath158 @xmath159s@xmath160 . the time taken to accelerate an electron from rest to a parallel velocity @xmath161 is @xmath162 , which evaluates to @xmath133 s taking @xmath163 cm",
    "s@xmath15 , the electron thermal speed at @xmath164 k. the electron - electron collision time entering the spitzer - harm conductivity is around 3000 s , so in lower - hybrid turbulence the heat conduction rate should be reduced from our former estimate by a factor 1/3000 , giving a cooling rate @xmath165 s@xmath15 , which is now comparable with that due to adiabatic expansion .",
    "higher degrees of lower hybrid turbulence ( see above ) would decrease the conductive cooling rate even further .    that the heat conductivity should be reduced from the spitzer - harm value in steep temperature gradients",
    "is well known ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however our estimate of heat conduction is significantly lower than one would normally predict .",
    "saturated conduction is usually defined as heat conduction where electrons carry their own thermal energy at their thermal speed .",
    "the rationale for this is that at faster flow speeds ( relative to the ions ) , a buneman instability would develop , generating langmuir waves that would inhibit the heat flow .",
    "applied to the case above , the saturated heat flux would be @xmath166 ergs @xmath153s@xmath15 .",
    "in our situation the heat conducting electrons may also excite lower - hybrid waves with a similar threshold drift velocity .",
    "in fact we should expect the limiting flux to be lower than this simple estimate , as indeed it is , because in our case not only heat conducting electrons but also ions generate the lower - hybrid turbulence .",
    "any electron heating mechanism invoked to explain the observed charge state distributions in the fast solar wind must require an anomalous thermal conductivity to avoid the deposited heat from being conducted back to the coronal hole , which would conflict with the sumer temperature diagnostics of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we consider that the heating and anomalous thermal conductivity provided simultaneously by lower - hybrid waves to be a desirable aspect of the model , in that one mechanism provides both features .",
    "in this paper we have argued that a small amount of the energy deposited in ions between 1.5 and 2 @xmath1 should eventually find its way to the electrons via an instability that generates lower hybrid waves . no attempt has been made to address the ion cyclotron heating problem , other than to show that the density gradients we require are similar to those postulated by @xcite to generate electrostatic ion cyclotron waves from a global resonant mhd mode . as such , our line of reasoning is complementary to that in a recent paper by @xcite . in addressing the larger problem of ion cyclotron heating ,",
    "these authors speculate that low frequency alfvn waves can landau damp on electrons .",
    "this parallel heating should produce electron beaming and discrete phase - space holes which may heat ions via stochastic processes .",
    "thus the ion heating derives from the electron energization ( by low frequency alfvn waves ) , rather than the electron heating deriving from the ion heating as in the picture presented here .    while a number of quantitative issues remain unresolved ( atomic data , thermal conduction ) , we believe that an explanation for the observed fast wind elemental charge states in terms of lower hybrid wave electron heating is certainly plausible , and should be considered along with other possibilities already discussed in the literature ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "more accurate numerical models would allow us to exploit this interpretation and allow more rigorous investigation of density inhomogeneities in the fast solar wind , with important consequences for the generation of ion cyclotron waves throughout the extended corona .",
    "as well as being potentially crucial to our understanding of the acceleration of the fast solar wind , the lower hybrid wave instability is also of interest elsewhere in astrophysics , and the sun and solar system offer an attractive `` laboratory '' for the exploration of collisionless plasma physics processes that are otherwise inaccessible to experiment ( see e.g. the recent debate on electron - ion equilibration in adafs in * ? ? ?",
