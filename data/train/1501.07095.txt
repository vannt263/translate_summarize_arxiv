    "the local standard of rest ( lsr ) is defined a point in space that is moving on a perfectly circular orbit around the galactic centre at the solar position .",
    "an accurate estimate of the lsr , namely measuring the peculiar velocities of the sun , is a starting point for galactic kinematic and dynamic studies since all measurements are made relative to the sun .",
    "it is needed for the derivations of basic parameters such as the oort constants , which describe the local spatial variations of the stellar velocity field ( feast & whitelock 1997 , olling & dehnen 2003 ) , as well as the orbital eccentricity distributions of different stellar populations which can be used to constrain the various scenarios of galactic disk formation ( sales et al .",

    "2011 ) . as a fundamental task of galactic astronomy , an accurate determination of the three galactic space velocity components of the solar motion with respect to the lsr",
    ", @xmath3 , @xmath0 and @xmath4 , has been a long - standing challenge .",
    "similar to the ones given in francis & anderson ( 2009 ) and cokunolu et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , table1 presents an updated summary of determinations ( including results from the current work ) of the solar motion from the literature of over a century .",
    "as the table 1 shows , in spite of utilizing a variety of methods and tracers , the measurements have hitherto failed to converge , especially for the component in the direction of galactic rotation ( @xmath0 ) .    in principle , the radial ( @xmath3 ) and vertical ( @xmath4 ) components of the solar motion can be directly obtained by taking the negative of the mean heliocentric velocities of various stellar populations in the solar - neighbourhood that are well relaxed .",
    "the situation for the component in the direction of galactic rotation ( @xmath0 ) is more complicated , due to the non - negligible values of asymmetric drift , @xmath6 , of stars with respect to the lsr ",
    "motions that are related to the velocity dispersions of the individual stellar populations of concern . the classical method to derive @xmath0",
    "is based on strmberg s equation ( strmberg 1946 ) , which assumes a linear correlation between the mean negative heliocentric azimuthal velocity , @xmath7 , and the squared radial velocity dispersion , @xmath8 , of any stellar sample .",
    "then a linear extrapolation to @xmath9 for an idealized population yields @xmath10 . theoretically , for any well - relaxed stellar population , the jeans equation , i.e. eq .",
    "( 4.228 ) of binney & tremaine ( 2008 ) , links the asymmetric drift , @xmath6 , with the radial velocity dispersion and the square bracket term ( radial scale lengths and the properties of velocity ellipsoid ) in axisymmetric equilibrium .",
    "the physical underpinning of strmberg s equation is that the square bracket term is a constant for the different stellar populations and the stellar populations used are in axisymmetric equilibrium .",
    "while the assumptions sound reasonable , the canonical value of @xmath11 , derived by dehnen and binney ( 1998 , hereafter db98 ) based on strmberg s equation , has recently been found to be @xmath12 smaller than those determined using open clusters ( piskunov et al .",
    "2006 ) and masers in massive star forming regions ( reid et al . 2009 ; bobylev & bajkova 2010 ; mcmillan & binney 2010 ) as tracers . the possible causes of discrepancies have been addressed recently by a number of investigators .",
    "schnrich et al .",
    "( 2010 ) show that strmberg relation could underestimate @xmath1 due to the presence of a metallicity gradient , which breaks the linear relation between the mean rotation velocity and the squared velocity dispersion of stars binned by colour .",
    "this implies that the square bracket term may vary from one population to another population as represented binned by the individual colour bins .",
    "in addition , the axisymmetric equilibrium of galactic potential , a basic assumption underlying strmberg s equation as mentioned above , can be broken due to the presence of significant non - axisymmetric structures in our galaxy ( e.g. the spiral arms , the central bar ; francis & anderson 2009 ; binney 2010 ) . apart from @xmath0",
    ", estimates of the radial and vertical components of the solar motion , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , can also be biased by the presence of non - axisymmetric structures .",
    "to minimize the effects of asymmetric drifts when estimating @xmath0 , two different methods have been developed that avoid the assumption of a constant square bracket term for the different stellar populations underlying strmberg s equation .",
    "one is to determine the solar peculiar velocity from the offset of the modelled velocity distribution that best matches the observed data ( binney 2010 ; schnrich et al . 2010 ; schnrich & binney 2012 , hereafter sb12 ) .",
    "alternatively , the lsr can also be determined utilizing cold populations of thin disc stars as tracers , under the assumption that they suffer from negligible asymmetric drifts ( francis & anderson 2009 ; cokunolu et al .",
    "compared to the method based on strmberg s equation , the latter approach has the advantage that it is simple and straight forward , and the results do not depend on the assumption that underpins the former method .",
    "the key to a successful application of this technique is to select and define a well representing sample of cold populations of thin disc stars .",
    "it should be emphasised that all the approaches outlined above assume axisymmetric equilibrium .",
    "thus it is essential to select a sample of stars that are least affected by those known non - axisymmetric structures .",

    "after corrected differential galactic rotation by fitting eq.(5 ) ( see also fig.9 ) .",
    "the value of each component is the mean of results deduced from the three sets of initial lsr listed in table 5 .",
    "the value of @xmath0 obtained in the current work by the vdf method is 12 km s@xmath2 smaller than those of binney ( 2010 ) and schnrich et al .",
    "the small differences might be caused by bulk motions that affect the samples used in these work , as discussed earlier .",
    "as fig.6 shows , the presence of the pleiades and/or hyades streams moves the peak of @xmath14 distribution of the gcs local sample toward negative values , leading to their estimates of @xmath1 being12 km s@xmath2 larger than obtained with the lss - gac sample , which shows a much smoother azimuthal velocity distribution and is less affected by the bulk motions of stellar streams .",
    "for the ctds method , we have determined the lsr based on two assumptions .",
    "firstly , we assume that cold populations of thin disc stars selected by applying an orbital eccentricity cut suffer from negligible asymmetric drift effects .",
    "the asymmetric drifts of cold populations of thin disc stars selected from the orbital eccentricity cut can be estimated approximately using eq .",
    "( 4.228 ) of binney & tremaine ( 2008 ) from the velocity dispersions ( @xmath15 ) , velocity ellipsoid , stellar density ( @xmath16 ) and circular speed ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "assume that the tilt angle is toward the galactic center ( binney et al .",
    "2014 ; bdenbender et al .",
    "2014 ) and both @xmath16 and @xmath18 are exponential functions of @xmath19 , @xmath20 @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the scale lengths of @xmath16 and @xmath18 , respectively . under those assumptions ,",
    "( 4.228 ) of binney & tremaine ( 2008 ) becomes , @xmath24\\,,\\ ] ] where the intrinsic velocity dispersions of the selected thin disc stars are @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 kms@xmath2 , respectively . adopting @xmath28 kpc from sharma et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , @xmath29 kpc , @xmath30 kms@xmath2 and a typical position @xmath31 kpc of the selected stars , we have @xmath32 kms@xmath2 . if using instead a larger scale length @xmath33 kpc from the recent work of chang et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the estimated value of @xmath6 decrease to 1.68 kms@xmath2 .",
    "the results show that our assumption that cold populations of thin disk stars selected with an orbital eccentricity cut of @xmath34@xmath35 have small asymmetric drifts is a reasonable one .",
    "this is corroborated by the close agreement of values of @xmath1 deduced from the two independent analyses , i.e. those based on the vdf and ctds methods , respectively .",
    "the effects of asymmetric drifts of the current sample of thin disc stars on @xmath1 estimation , if any , are likely to be quite small deduced from the ctds method is only 0.62 kms@xmath2 _ larger _ than that deduced from the vdf method ( which fully accounts for the effects of asymmetric drifts ) , the value of @xmath6 of the current sample of thin disc stars is likely to be smaller than 1 kms@xmath2 . ] . as a further test of the assumption",
    ", we note that stars of different spectral types ( populations ) suffer from different levels of the asymmetric drift effects . for sub - samples of dwarfs of f , g and k spectral type",
    ", the level of those effects can vary from a few to tens of km s@xmath2 ( db98 , schnrich et al .",
    "the fact that all the three of f , g and k sub - samples give consistent results suggest again the assumption is a reasonable one .",
    "as described earlier , the second assumption underlying our analysis with the ctds method is that the sample suffers from little systematic kinematic effects , induced by , for example , non - axisymmetric structures , accretion events or asymmetric mass infall . as already pointed out in section 5.1",
    ", the current sample does not seem to be affected significantly by any moving group .",
    "the validity of this assumption also seems to be supported by the consistent results yielded by the individual sub - samples of different spectral type , considering that those sub - samples probe different depths ( because of their different intrinsic , absolute magnitudes ) .",
    "fig.11 plots the results from the three sub - samples for the case of the db98 initial lsr .",
    "the values of solar motion derived from the sub - samples are presented in table6 . fig.11 and",
    "table6 show that for all the three velocity components of lsr , the values yielded by all the three sub - samples agree within the fitting errors . as a by - product",
    ", the results also suggest that the local disk seems to be radially and vertically stable and circularly symmetric .",
    "we note all the errors quoted for the estimates of lsr presented here are purely formal .",
    "there are potential systematic errors for both the methods of vdf and ctds . for the vdf method",
    ", potential biases may come from the underlying assumptions and approximations , as well as from the parameters adopted to construct the analytical azimuthal velocity distribution . as for the ctds method , we believe that the effects of asymmetric drift are minor , although effects on the level of @xmath362 km s@xmath2 could be present as estimated above , considering that the thin disc stars selected do not have exactly zero eccentricity , i.e. they do not move in perfect circular orbits . although there might be a variety of potential sources of systematic errors affecting the results from both methods , it is reassuring that both methods yield consistent values of @xmath0 within 2@xmath37 .",
    "our final , adopted values of lsr are presented in table 7 , obtained by taking the mean of individual estimates , weighted by the inverse square of the formal errors of individual estimates .",
    "the traditional method based on strmberg s equation fails to produce accurate estimates of the lsr , especially for the @xmath0 component , due to the presence of kinematic and/or metallicity biases addressed recently by a number of investigators . in this work ,",
    "two alternative and independent methods have been used to derive the lsr using a completely new sample of stars selected from the lss - gac dr1 .",
    "the first method derives @xmath0 by fiting the observed azimuthal velocity distribution with an analytical distribution function which has been shown to reproduce well reults from rigorous torus - based dynamics modeling .",
    "we obtain @xmath38kms@xmath2 .",
    "the value is about 12 kms@xmath2 smaller than those derived by binney ( 2010 ) and schnrich et al .",
    "( 2010 ) by applying the same method to the gcs local sample .",
    "we suggest that the small differences are caused by the presence of stellar streams that significantly plagues the gcs sample , but to a much less extent the lss - gac dr1 sample .",
    "the second method derives the lsr directly using cold populations of thin disc stars as tracers .",
    "the method relies on the definition of a proper sample of cold populations of thin disc stars . in this paper",
    ", we propose that the orbital eccentricity serves as a natural quantity to select cold populations of thin disc stars . after applying an orbital eccentricity cut ,",
    "two approaches are adopted to correct for the effects of differential galactic rotation and determine the lsr .",
    "the first approach is applicable to the @xmath39 component only .",
    "the analysis yields @xmath40 km s@xmath2 . the second approach , under the assumption of a flat rotation curve and negligible asymmetric drifts ,",
    "is based on gaussian fitting to the measured velocity distributions , after correcting for the effects of differential galactic rotation .",
    "values of @xmath3 derived from both approaches are consistent with each other and in agreement with that deduced from maser measurements ( bobylev & bajkova 2010 , 2014 ) . from the second approach ,",
    "we find @xmath41 km s@xmath2 , which is consistent within 2@xmath37 with the value deduced by the method of vdf .",
    "our newly derived value of @xmath42 km s@xmath2 is very close to the recent estimate of schnrich ( 2012 ) . both for vdf and ctds methods",
    ", the whole sample is further divided into sub - samples of f , g and k spectral types .",
    "results derived from those sub - samples all yield consistent results , as listed in table 4 and 6 .",
    "the results corroborate the robustness of the lsr determined by both methods",
    ".    benefited from the lss - gac dr1 and the ucac4 proper motion catalog , we have built the largest local sample of fgk main - sequence stars within 600 pc of the sun with accurate distances and velocities . by controlling the random errors discussed in section 4 and correcting systematic errors both in radial velocities and in proper motions as discussed in section 3.2 , the sample has enabled us to determine the lsr with the smallest uncertainties hitherto ( see table 1 ) .",
    "our final recommended values of lsr are : ( @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath4 ) = ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) km s@xmath2 ( see table7 ) .",
