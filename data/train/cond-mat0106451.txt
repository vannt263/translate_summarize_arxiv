    "quantum dots , often referred to as artificial atoms @xcite , were intensively studied in recent years both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite . a number of different theoretical methods , including , e.g. , exact diagonalization @xcite , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) @xcite , hartree - fock @xcite and density - functional calculations @xcite , were employed for investigating the ground state properties of dots , which are responsible for many of the experimentally observed effects .",
    "in this paper we present a new concept to calculate ground state properties of quantum dots in high magnetic fields , with application to systems with up to 40 electrons .",
    "this approach is motivated by the evidence that in high magnetic fields @xmath1 quantum dot electrons tend to form a wigner cluster @xcite .",
    "therefore , we construct a ground - state many - body variational wave function in the form of a slater determinant with ( overlapping ) single - particle wave functions centered at or near equilibrium positions of classical point particles .",
    "the classical configurations are calculated either analytically ( for @xmath2 ) or using the monte carlo minimization @xcite .",
    "expectation values of observables can be formulated analytically .",
    "here we present ground state energies for disc - like quantum dots with up to 40 electrons .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath3 electrons moving in the plane @xmath4 , in the lateral potential @xmath5 , and in the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system has the form    @xmath7 ^ 2}{2m^ * } +   v ( { { \\mathbf r } } _ i ) \\right ] + v_c + e_z , \\label{hamiltonian}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the coulomb energy of electron - electron interaction and @xmath10 is the zeeman energy .",
    "the solutions of the single - particle problem ( fock and darwin , @xcite ) are given by @xmath11 , where @xmath12 , @xmath13^{-1/2 } $ ] , @xmath14 is the cyclotron frequency , @xmath15 are associated laguerre polynomials , @xmath16 is the number of nodes , and @xmath17 is the angular momentum quantum number .",
    "in strong magnetic fields electrons tend to localize around the classical equilibrium positions , and their spins to be aligned along the magnetic field .",
    "this tendency suggests to write the trial many - body wave function @xmath18 in the form of a slater determinant ( as has been done in ref .",
    "@xcite for a related problem )    @xmath19    where @xmath20 are fock - darwin wave functions with an additional phase factor caused by a magnetic translation @xcite of the @xmath21-th electron to the center at @xmath22 .",
    "the non - negative integer @xmath23 and the vectors @xmath24 are free parameters of the theory . in general , the single particle wave functions @xmath25 are not orthogonal , and the overlap of the neighbor single - particle states needs not to be small .    using the trial wave functions @xmath26 we analytically calculate expectation values of the energy and the density of electrons .",
    "the energy is minimized with respect to the variational parameters @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "figure [ fig_bolton ] shows the calculated ground state energy of a system of 310 electrons , together with reference data from ref .",
    "@xcite , obtained by the qmc method .",
    "the small numbers 0 and 1 over the dotted lines indicate that , starting from the corresponding points the trial wave functions @xmath27 or @xmath28 gave the lowest energy .",
    "the parameters @xmath29 were chosen according to classical equilibrium configurations and were not varied in figure [ fig_bolton ] .",
    "as seen from the figure , our results are very close to ( and sometimes even lower than ) the qmc results at @xmath30 . in this range",
    "typical relative deviations of the total energy are @xmath31 and less . optimizing the parameters @xmath29 we could get even better agreement with the qmc results in the range @xmath32 ( the optimized radius of electron shells is up to 20% larger at small magnetic fields than the classical radius ) .",
    "the accuracy of our results shows a tendency to increase with larger @xmath1 and/or @xmath3 . at the upper range of the magnetic field the relative deviation is about @xmath33 for @xmath34 and even less for higher @xmath3 .",
    "this remarkably good agreement and its tendency to become even better with increasing electron number demonstrates the capability of the new method and is promise for obtaining reliable results for even higher electron numbers .",
    "figure [ fig_qm_class ] gives calculated ground state energies @xmath35 in the range of up to @xmath36 , for which suitable exact reference values were not available . with increasing magnetic field",
    "we find a clear convergence of @xmath37 towards @xmath38 , so that we can write @xmath39 the correction @xmath40 is positive , tends to zero at @xmath41 , and for @xmath42 it is smaller than 2% at @xmath43 and smaller than 0.6% at @xmath44 . equation ( [ approx ] ) refines the rigorous mathematical result by yngvason @xcite and has a transparent physical meaning : the quantum mechanical ground state energy of the dot is a sum of the classical potential energy , the quantum mechanical kinetic energy , and the small rest energy @xmath40 , which decreases .",
    "we have presented a new method to calculate ground state expectation values for parabolic quantum dots in ( high ) magnetic fields .",
    "the results were obtained by evaluating the expectation value , for which we found an analytical expression using a specially designed trial wave function .",
    "it takes into account the classical equilibrium positions of the electrons and has the correct symmetry for a fermion system with fully polarized spins . in the high magnetic field regime",
    "our results compare favourably with qmc data , but are much less demanding in computer time .",
    "therefore , an extension to higher electron numbers becomes possible as we demonstrate by showing results for up to 40 electrons .",
    "we put forward a simple interpretation of our results for the ground state energy , eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) , and gave the upper estimate for the rest energy term @xmath40 in the studied range of @xmath3 and the magnetic field .",
