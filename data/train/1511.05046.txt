    "mathematical models of tumour growth provide insight into the dynamic characteristics of tumour cell populations .",
    "important issues are cell proliferation , cell heterogeneity , and cell differentiation . these issues are currently examined in two hypothesized models of tumour evolution : the cancer stem cell ( csc ) model and the clonal evolution ( ce ) model@xcite .",
    "both models have scientific support , as well as therapeutic implications , and in fact , both models may be involved in the development of a tumour .",
    "the essential distinction of the two models is the role of self - renewal in specific cells , and the fraction of the total cell populations that these cells comprise . here",
    "self - renewal means the ability of a cell to inherit a specific function through an unlimited number of successive cell generations .",
    "the csc model hypothesizes that a very small sub - population of tumour stem cells generate the entire tumour cell population @xcite . in mathematical treatments ,",
    "these stem cells have the ability to self - renew indefinitely , and through sequential mutations generate all the heterogeneous and differentiated cell types comprising the tumour @xcite .",
    "this stem cell population lies at the apex of a hierarchical structure of cell types , and tumour evolution is dependent on their unconstrained self - renewing ability @xcite .",
    "the ce model hypothesizes that a tumour population is composed of multiple genetically identical clones , which have the possibility of mutation , selection , and expansion @xcite . in the ce model",
    "all undifferentiated cells have a self - renewing capacity for contributing to the tumour evolution .",
    "these cells , however , are not at the apex of a hierarchal tree , but rather dispersed widely throughout the tumour cell population as a large fraction of the total tumour cell count .",
    "a central element of cell self - renewal is the hayflick limit , which constrains differentiated cell lines to a finite number of divisions @xcite .",
    "as differentiated cells divide , telomeres ( nucleotide sequences at the ends of chromosomes ) shorten until a critical limit is reached , and further divisions are prohibited @xcite .",
    "the existence of a mechanism which reverses telomere shortening was predicted several decades ago .",
    "the csc model hypothesizes that cancer stem cells circumvent telomere shortening by using the enzyme telomerase to replace their telomeres , and thus obtain the ability to divide indefinitely @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown that around 90% of all types of human cancer exhibit a form of telomerase activation [ 27 ] . in the csc model",
    "this property resides in an extremely small sub - population , from which all the differentiated tumour cells derive .",
    "in contrast , the ce model hypothesizes that a large number of undifferentiated cells , in clonal sub - populations , possess the ability to restore telomeres , and thus sustain the tumour evolution .",
    "these two models differ greatly in their fraction of self - renewing cells within the total population .",
    "mathematical models provide a way to compare these self - renewal properties in proliferating cell populations .    in order to model the dynamics of self - renewing cells lineages , which correspond physiologically to chromosomal telomere lengths ,",
    "is it necessary to track all cells through successive generations .",
    "many mathematical treatments of telomere structure in cell population dynamics have been developed @xcite .",
    "the csc model has been treated for example in @xcite , where telomere shortening is investigated in continuum differential equation models .",
    "the key focus of these treatments is that mother stem cells produce two daughter cells , one of which is a stem cell , and the other , a differentiated cell , with a limited number of future divisions .",
    "these models describe a finite number of sub - populations , each with an idealised precise telomere length .",
    "the self - renewal property of a stem cell is captured by one daughter cell remaining in the highest telomere class and the other daughter cell transiting to a lower telomere class .",
    "a descent of telomere length shortening continues in each class , with one daughter cell retaining the length of the mother and the other a lower length .",
    "this model yields a minute fraction of stem cells at the apex of the total population , consistent with the csc literature @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to develop a mathematical analysis for the alternative ce model and to quantify its dynamic properties .",
    "our model here incorporates continuum , rather than discrete , telomere lengths in cells .",
    "this idealised continuum telomere length is assumed for convenience , to avoid unwieldy compartmentalisation with each telomere length subclass . in our ce model of telomere shortening",
    "there is an unbalanced division of a mother cell to two daughter cells in terms of telomere length .",
    "the telomere length of a daughter cell may be less ( corresponding to a differentiated cell ) , or may be equal or greater ( corresponding to a self - renewing cell ) than the mother cell . in this way the restoration of telomeres and the self - renewal property of cells is distributed through a large proportion of the tumour cell population , consistent with the ce literature@xcite .",
    "the distribution of daughter cell telomere lengths is governed by a mathematically formulated rule that assigns the telomere restoration property to cells which may be viewed as those capable of indefinite divisions in each of the diverse clonal sub - populations .",
    "our ce model belongs to the class of continuum structured population models , with age and time as dynamic variables , and telomere length as a population structure variable . in the past three decades",
    "physiologically structured population models have been increasingly utilised to shed light on some important phenomena of cell populations @xcite .",
    "the power of structuring a population with respect to physiological variables is of great value in understanding the evolution of biological populations .",
    "there is an increasing literature of physiologically structured population models with more than one ( physiological ) structuring variable .",
    "the development of a unified mathematical framework , where structuring variables play substantially different roles , promises to be extremely challenging from the theoretical point of view .",
    "we first consider the following linear model for an age and telomere length structured proliferating cancer cell population .",
    "@xmath0 above @xmath1 stands for the density of cells of age @xmath2 , having telomere length @xmath3 at time @xmath4 .",
    "we assume a maximum cell age denoted by @xmath5 and a maximum telomere length denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "the population count at time @xmath4 of cells with age between @xmath7 and @xmath8 and telomere length between @xmath9 and @xmath10 is @xmath11 and the total population of all cells at time @xmath4 is @xmath12 @xmath13 quantifies the natural mortality of cells of age @xmath2 and telomere length @xmath3 .",
    "a mother cell of age @xmath2 and telomere length @xmath3 divides into two daughter cells of age @xmath14 having ( possibly ) different telomere lengths , at a rate determined by the function @xmath15 .",
    "the function @xmath16 describes the distribution of daughter telomere lengths @xmath3 from a mother cell of telomere length @xmath17 .",
    "the boundary condition ( [ line - eq2 ] ) accounts for cell division of a mother cell into two daughter cells and requires that @xmath18 from a probabilistic interpretation of @xmath16 it would be natural to normalise the maximal telomere length @xmath6 to @xmath19 . throughout",
    "we retain @xmath6 as a general parameter .",
    "we will impose further regularity assumptions on the model ingredients later on .",
    "note that our model - can be considered as a continuous telomere length structured counterpart of the model recently introduced in @xcite .",
    "our starting model - is a linear one , moreover the telomere length @xmath3 only plays an important role in the somewhat unusual boundary condition . hence to establish the existence of the governing linear semigroup ( and therefore the existence of mild solutions of the pde - ) we use a boundary perturbation result due to greiner , see theorem 2.3 in @xcite ; see also @xcite and @xcite for similar general results .",
    "it is very natural to apply the boundary perturbation result of greiner , since the unperturbed generator ( arising from equation with zero flux boundary condition ) is readily shown to generate a translation semigroup .",
    "moreover , it has the added advantage that the spectrally determined growth behaviour of the semigroup follows almost instantaneously , see proposition 3.1 in @xcite .",
    "for basic definitions and results not introduced in the section we refer the reader to @xcite .    to apply the perturbation result of greiner we set the framework as follows .",
    "assume that @xmath20\\times [ 0,l_m])$ ] and @xmath21 , and that all of the model parameters are non - negative .",
    "in particular , it is natural to assume that @xmath22 does not vanish ( in @xmath2 ) identically for any @xmath23 .",
    "we also impose the natural assumption that cells reaching the maximal age do not reproduce anymore , i.e. @xmath24 .",
    "this assumption is completely natural from the biological point of view .",
    "if cells would still divide upon reaching the maximum age then it would be natural to extend the age - interval beyond @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , we have set the maximal age @xmath5 such that cells of this age do not divide for any more . on the other hand",
    ", we will see later when we introduce nonlinearities in model - , that non - reproducing cells still play a role in the population dynamics , in particular they may affect competition induced mortality .",
    "also note that alternatively , we could have assumed that the mortality is locally integrable with respect to age , but @xmath25 holds , i.e. no individuals survive the maximal age @xmath5 .    for the linear problem - , since we are dealing with density functions , the natural choice of state space is the following lebesgue space .",
    "@xmath26 elements of @xmath27 above can be understood as equivalence classes of measurable functions @xmath28 on the square @xmath29 such that @xmath30 .",
    "we further set @xmath31 .",
    "we define the operators @xmath32 and @xmath33 as follows @xmath34 with @xmath35 we further introduce the norm @xmath36 with the @xmath37 norm @xmath38 is complete , and the maximal operator @xmath39 is continuous and linear .",
    "furthermore , we define @xmath40 then @xmath41 is also continuous and linear , and we have im@xmath42 .",
    "we denote by @xmath43 the restriction of @xmath32 to ker@xmath44 .",
    "it is then clear that @xmath43 generates the strongly continuous and nilpotent shift semigroup @xmath45 , explicitly given as @xmath46 in particular note that for @xmath47 we have @xmath48 for any initial condition @xmath49 .",
    "we now define the bounded linear perturbing operator @xmath50 as follows @xmath51 we also define the corresponding perturbed generator @xmath52 as @xmath53 we recall the main result from @xcite for the reader s convenience .",
    "[ greiner ] if @xmath54 , then @xmath52 is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup @xmath55 on @xmath27 .",
    "we now apply theorem [ greiner ] to establish the existence of the governing linear semigroup . in our setting",
    "we have @xmath56 , and @xmath57 . furthermore , to compute the adjoint @xmath58 ,",
    "we note that @xmath59 if we let @xmath60 next we note that ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sect.iii.5 ) ) @xmath61 if there exists an @xmath62 such that @xmath63 for any @xmath64 integration by parts yields @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and if we let @xmath67 .",
    "hence it follows from the regularity assumptions on @xmath22 and @xmath68 that we have @xmath69 hence theorem [ greiner ] implies that @xmath52 generates a strongly continuous semigroup .",
    "next we note that for @xmath70 , the operator @xmath71 is a continuous bijection from @xmath72 onto @xmath73 , hence its inverse @xmath74 is continuous , for @xmath70 . in particular , a straightforward calculation shows that in our setting we have @xmath75 , and therefore for @xmath76 large enough @xmath77 is invertible and positive .",
    "hence by lemma 1.4 in @xcite we have that @xmath78 is positive for @xmath76 large enough .",
    "since @xmath33 is a bounded multiplication operator , we draw the following conclusion .",
    "@xmath79 generates a positive strongly continuous semigroup of bounded linear operators on @xmath27 .",
    "in this section we study the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of the linear model - . in particular , as we will see , we are going to characterise the spectral bound of the linear semigroup generator @xmath79 implicitly via the spectral radius of an associated ( bounded ) integral operator .",
    "we will then obtain estimates for the spectral radius of this integral operator .    as we have pointed out earlier one of the advantages of the perturbation theorem of greiner ( theorem [ greiner ] ) is that it allows us to establish a desirable regularity property of the semigroup in a straightforward fashion .",
    "to this end , for the rest of the paper we further assume that @xmath68 satisfies the following regularity condition .",
    "@xmath80 note that , for example if @xmath68 is continuous on the square @xmath81\\times [ 0,l_m]$ ] , then condition clearly holds .",
    "we recall now from @xcite the result we are going to apply , for the readers convenience .",
    "in particular , proposition 3.1 in @xcite reads as follows .",
    "[ gre - prop ] if @xmath52 generates a semigroup and @xmath82 is compact then @xmath83 . in particular , @xmath84 contains only poles of finite algebraic multiplicity of the resolvent @xmath78 .",
    "in the proposition above @xmath85 stands for the component of the resolvent set of @xmath43 , which is unbounded to the right .",
    "we apply now proposition [ gre - prop ] in our setting . in what follows , with a slight abuse of notation",
    ", we will denote the semigroup generated by @xmath79 by @xmath55 .",
    "[ prop ] assume that holds .",
    "then the spectrum of the governing linear semigroup @xmath55 may contain only elements of the form @xmath86 , where @xmath76 is an eigenvalue of its generator @xmath79 .",
    "we note that @xmath33 is bounded and @xmath43 generates a nilpotent semigroup . hence , utilising proposition [ gre - prop ] , it is only left to show that @xmath82 is compact .",
    "let @xmath87 denote the unit sphere of @xmath27 .",
    "we have to show that @xmath88 is relatively compact in @xmath31 . using the frchet - kolmogorov criterion of compactness of sets in @xmath89 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.x.1 ) , it is enough to show that on the one hand we have @xmath90 on the other hand we have @xmath91 therefore we have @xmath92 uniformly in @xmath93 .",
    "we shall point out that we really needed to utilise proposition [ gre - prop ] by greiner , to obtain that the asymptotic behaviour of the semigroup is determined by the leading eigenvalue of its generator ( if it exists ) .",
    "this is due to the distributed structuring with respect to the telomere length of cells , which implies that the governing semigroup is not necessarily eventually differentiable ; hence we could not conclude , as for example in @xcite for a classic size - structured models , that the semigroup is eventually compact , and henceforth the spectral mapping theorem holds true .    as we have seen earlier",
    "the semigroup @xmath55 generated by @xmath79 is clearly positive , but it may not necessarily be irreducible . to see this , recall from @xcite , that the semigroup generated by @xmath79 is irreducible if and",
    "only if for every @xmath94 , @xmath95 , we have that @xmath96 , i.e. the resolvent is strictly positive , for some @xmath97 .",
    "let @xmath98 , and note that the solution of the resolvent equation + @xmath99 is @xmath100 applying the boundary operator @xmath82 on both sides of equation , it is easily shown that @xmath101 satisfies the inhomogeneous integral equation @xmath102 above in we introduced the notation @xmath103 note that since telomere length is preserved during the lifetime of an individual , it is intuitively clear that the semigroup is irreducible if offspring of all telomere length is produced by some individuals . in other words ,",
    "if there were individuals of particular telomere lengths who would not produce individuals of any other lengths , then the semigroup would be reducible .",
    "we formulate now a rigorous condition for the irreducibility of the semigroup , as this will play an important role later in the qualitative analysis of model - .",
    "the semigroup @xmath55 generated by @xmath79 is irreducible if and only if for any set @xmath104 $ ] of positive lebesgue measure , such that its complement set @xmath105 is also a set of positive lebesgue measure , we have @xmath106    note that by virtue of the positivity of the semigroup generated by @xmath79 , the resolvent operator @xmath107 is positive , for @xmath76 large enough .",
    "hence the solution @xmath101 of equation is necessarily non - negative almost everywhere .",
    "assume now that does not hold , i.e. @xmath108 for some sets @xmath109 of positive measure .",
    "then it is clear that for any @xmath94 vanishing on @xmath105 , equation would admit a solution @xmath101 vanishing on @xmath105 , too ; and therefore @xmath110 given by would also vanish on @xmath105 . on the other hand ,",
    "if there was a function @xmath111 vanishing on a set @xmath112 $ ] of positive measure for almost every @xmath113 , then equation would imply that the solution @xmath101 of would also vanish on @xmath114 , but then this would clearly imply @xmath115 , a contradiction .",
    "proposition [ prop ] implies that the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of model - is determined by the eigenvalues of the generator ( if there are any ) , hence we study this eigenvalue problem now . in particular , the solution of the eigenvalue problem @xmath116 is given by @xmath117 applying the boundary operator @xmath82 on both sides of the equation above we have @xmath118 where we defined @xmath119 hence @xmath120 is an eigenvalue of @xmath79 if and only if , for the given @xmath76 , the integral equation has a non - trivial solution @xmath121 .",
    "then , the eigenvector corresponding to @xmath76 is given by .",
    "we are in particular interested in the leading eigenvalue ( if it exists ) , which is the spectral bound of the generator , since the semigroup @xmath55 is positive .",
    "this dominant real eigenvalue , together with the corresponding eigenspace , determines the asymptotic behaviour of solutions .",
    "also note that equation gives naturally rise to define a parametrised family of ( positive and bounded ) integral operators @xmath122 as @xmath123 with this , the characteristic equation , which is notably a functional equation , in contrast to a scalar equation in case of a model with age - structure only ; can be viewed as an eigenvalue problem for a bounded linear integral operator .",
    "more precisely , @xmath76 is an eigenvalue of the generator @xmath79 , if and only the integral operator @xmath122 has eigenvalue @xmath19 .",
    "note that , since @xmath124 defined in is strictly positive , the integral operator @xmath122 ( for every @xmath125 ) is irreducible if and only if condition holds ( * ? ? ? * ch.v ) .",
    "hence , rightly so , the irreducibility conditions of the semigroup @xmath55 and the integral operator @xmath122 coincide .",
    "also note that the function @xmath126 is continuous and strictly monotone decreasing .",
    "these properties can be established by using perturbation results from @xcite and @xcite , respectively ; see also @xcite for similar developments .",
    "also note that if @xmath68 satisfies condition then @xmath127 is shown to be compact exactly in the same way as the operator @xmath82 was shown to be compact earlier .",
    "hence the spectrum of @xmath127 may contain only eigenvalues and @xmath14 .    therefore , in the case when the spectrum of @xmath79 is not empty , we have the following complete characterisation of the asymptotic behaviour of solutions of model - .    1 .   if @xmath128 , then solutions of model - decay exponentially .",
    "if @xmath129 , then solutions of model - grow exponentially . moreover , if @xmath68 satisfies condition , then solutions exhibit asynchronous exponential growth .",
    "if @xmath130 , then for any eigenvector @xmath121 corresponding to the spectral radius @xmath19 of @xmath127 , the function @xmath131 in determines a one - parameter family of positive steady states of model - .",
    "if @xmath68 satisfies , then there is only one such family of steady states , moreover they are strictly positive , too .",
    "after the previous general analysis of the asymptotic behaviour of our model next we intend to study the effect of the well - known capacity of telomere restoring of cancer cells on the dynamics .",
    "in particular we are going to show , that at least for some general classes of the model ingredients , the telomere length restoring capacity of cancer cells may have a drastic effect on the asymptotic behaviour of solutions already in the linear model - .",
    "first we note that in the absence of telomere restoring capacity of cells , the function @xmath68 necessarily vanishes on the half square @xmath132 .",
    "that is , when a mother cell divides , it only gives birth to daughter cells with shorter telomeres .",
    "this is a well - known mechanism observed in healthy cell populations . in particular",
    "this telomere shortening of healthy cells results in apoptosis ( when reaching the celebrated hayflick limit ) and prevent the possibility of drastic mutations caused by a very large number of iterations of faulty dna replication . in this case",
    "the boundary condition can be rewritten as @xmath133 this in particular implies that the eigenvalue problem now reads @xmath134 where we also introduced the notation @xmath135 , for simplicity .",
    "let us assume now that the the function @xmath68 is separable , i.e. @xmath136 holds for some functions @xmath137 . for example",
    "we may assume that @xmath138 is continuously differentiable and @xmath139 is bounded , and that @xmath138 is positive while @xmath139 is non - negative .",
    "then assumption clearly holds . in this case",
    "differentiating equation ( assuming that an eigenvector @xmath131 with a smooth @xmath140 component exists ) yields the differential equation @xmath141 together with the initial condition @xmath142 the solution of is @xmath143 which , utilising , leads to the following characteristic equation @xmath144 it is clear that equation does not admit any solution @xmath125 , which , together with the positivity of the semigroup , implies that the spectrum of @xmath79 does not contain any eigenvalue with a corresponding eigenvector @xmath131 with a continuously differentiable @xmath145 . on the other hand",
    "it is clear from equation that any eigenvector is continuous with respect to its second variable . from the biological point of view",
    "this phenomenon is associated with the constant loss of telomere length of newborn cells . indeed , in the absence of telomere restoring capacity we may expect that the cell population accumulates at the minimal length . from the mathematical point of view , the non - existence of differentiable eigenvectors is associated with the fact that the governing semigroup can not shown to be eventually differentiable due to the telomere length structuring .",
    "next we consider what happens if we account for the telomere restoring capacity of cancer cells .",
    "in particular we are going to show that in this case even exponential growth of the cancer cell population is possible .",
    "as before , we start with the case of a separable @xmath68 , i.e. we assume that @xmath136 for some functions @xmath137 . in this case the integral operator @xmath127 is of rank one , and it is rather straightforward to exactly determine the spectral radius of @xmath127 , which , as we have seen earlier , determines the asymptotic behaviour of the semigroup @xmath55",
    ". in particular , we have @xmath146 from we can see that depending on the functions @xmath147 and @xmath22 , the spectral radius @xmath148 may be greater than @xmath19 .",
    "for example in the case of constant functions @xmath149 , and setting @xmath150 ( note that we can always normalise the maximal age and telomere length ) , we have @xmath151    to obtain estimates for the spectral radius of @xmath127 in the more general and difficult non - separable case , note that the krein - rutman theorem asserts that if @xmath127 is compact and positive , and its spectral radius is positive , then it has a positive ( not necessarily strictly positive ) eigenvector corresponding to its spectral radius . on the other hand de pagter proved in @xcite",
    "that if the operator is also irreducible then its spectral radius is strictly positive . as we noted earlier",
    "if @xmath68 satisfies condition then @xmath127 is shown to be compact in the same way as the operator @xmath82 .",

    "then we have @xmath153 which yields @xmath154 this observation allows us to obtain immediately the following estimates for the spectral radius @xmath155 to obtain different estimates , in particular when @xmath127 may not be irreducible we are going to utilise some minimax principles established in @xcite . recall that if @xmath27 is a banach lattice with positive cone @xmath124 , and with dual space @xmath156 and dual cone @xmath157 , respectively ; then a set @xmath158 is called @xmath124-total if and only if from @xmath159 it follows that @xmath160 .",
