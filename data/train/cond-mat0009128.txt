    "identifying the origin of itinerant ferromagnetism in metals and specifying simple models exhibiting it are two of the most intriguing and long - standing problems in condensed matter physics . here",
    "we report the results of low - energy perturbation theory calculations and supporting zero temperature quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations that suggest the existence and mechanisms for ferromagnetic ( fm ) ground states in the two - dimensional periodic anderson model .",
    "> from a historical point of view , the one - band , nearest - neighbor hopping hubbard model was one of the first models proposed to describe itinerant ferromagnetism ; however , the ferromagnetic phase has never been found at physical parameter values .",
    "the numerical calculations , for example , have narrowed the extent of this phase to a small region around the nagaoka point @xcite , that is , the strong coupling limit for one hole doped away from half - filling .",
    "paradoxically , in two - dimensions ( 2d ) , this model exhibits anti - ferromagnetism at half - filling and anti - ferromagnetic correlations around half - filling at weak and intermediate couplings .",
    "recently , guerrero and noack @xcite listed several possible extensions of the hubbard model that should enhance ferromagnetism : ( i ) the addition of frustrating hopping terms @xcite , ( ii ) the inclusion of more than one orbital per unit cell , and ( iii ) the addition of more general nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite .",
    "in fact , a number of frustrated models with more general interactions , such as the @xmath2 hubbard model , and multiband models , such as the periodic anderson model ( pam ) , have ferromagnetic ground states @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the properties of the two - dimensional pam .    the pam is often used to describe the essential physics of many transition metals and rare - earth and actinide metallic compounds including the so - called heavy - fermion systems @xcite .",
    "the model includes a band of `` light '' uncorrelated electrons hybridized with a band of heavy strongly correlated electrons . despite intense efforts to determine its phases , only a few controlled analytical approximations and numerical calculations exist for @xmath3 .",
    "instead , previous work often studied the single - impurity anderson model and focused on the competition between kondo screening and the direct rkky coupling between the localized spins @xcite .",
    "this competition is present when the number of conduction electrons is at least similar to the number of singly - occupied low - lying @xmath4-levels . in @xmath5 ,",
    "much less attention has been given to the region of the phase diagram where the density of electrons in the conduction band is small ; however , it is for this case that ferromagnetism has been established in one dimensional systems @xcite .    using the density matrix renormalization ( dmrg ) method in the one - dimension , noack and guerrero @xcite , for example , found partially and completely saturated ferromagnetism in the pam .",
    "they considered a parameter regime where the energy of orbital state @xmath6 and the strength of the coulomb repulsion @xmath7 were adjusted so each orbital had just one electron .",
    "the position of the orbital energy was below the lower band of the non - interacting problem , and one electron per orbital corresponds to a 1/4-filled non - interacting problem . for a sufficiently large value of @xmath7 ,",
    "the model exhibited a ferromagnetic ground state . beyond an interaction - dependent value of the doping and a doping - dependent value of @xmath7 , this state disappeared .",
    "the ferromagnetic phase was a peninsula in a phase diagram that was otherwise a sea of paramagnetism except at 1/4 and 1/2 filling where the ground state of the pam was antiferromagnetic .",
    "ferromagnetism seems to be readily found by mean - filed approximations in any dimensions @xcite . using a slave - boson mean - field theory ( sbmft ) for the symmetric pam , mller and wlfe @xcite found results similar to those of noack and guerrero . at 1/2 filling",
    ", they found a paramagnetic ( pm ) or antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase depending on the value of the coulomb repulsion @xmath7 . by lowering the density of electrons from 1/2 filling",
    ", they also found a smooth crossover from af to fm order via a spiral phase . just before 1/4 filling , they got a first - order transition from fm to af order .",
    "more recently , the sbmft calcualtions of doradzi ' nski and spalek @xcite found wide regions of ferromagnetism in the intermediate valence regime that surprisingly extended well below 1/4 filling .    in the low temperature dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) calculations , tahvildar - zadeh _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite also found a region of ferromagnetism and studied its temperature dependence . at very low temperatures ,",
    "their ferromagnetic region extended over a wide range of electron density and in many cases embraced the electron density of 3/8 . at 3/8 filling they proposed a specific kondo - induced mechanism for ferromagnetism that has the conduction electrons in a spin - polarized charge density - wave anti - aligned with the ferromagnetically aligned local moments on the valence orbitals . more recently",
    "meyer and nolting@xcite appended perturbation theory to dmft and also predicted ferromagnetism over a broad ramge of electron filling extending below 1/4 filling .",
    "our previous @xcite and new qmc results qualitatively agree with the dmrg work ; however , the phases we find quantitatively and qualitatively disagree with those derived from the mean - field approximations .",
    "quantitatively , we find ferromagnetism in a narrower doping range than the one predicted by the dmft and sbmft calculations . for densities between 3/8 and 1/2 , qmc predicts a paramagnetic region .",
    "whereas mean - field theory predicts a ferromagnetic states in part of that region .",
    "in fact , at a filling of 3/8 where these calculations predict ferromagnetism , we find a novel ground state of an entirely different symmetry . instead of ferromagnetism",
    ", qmc finds a resonating spin density - wave ( rsdw ) state ; that is , the ground state was a linear combination of two degenerate spin - density waves characterized by the @xmath8 and @xmath9 wave vectors .",
    "we remark that the quantitative differences between the dmrg and qmc calculations and the dmft and sbmft calculations most likely result from the expected breakdown of mean - field theory in one and two dimensions .",
    "probably the rsdw state was not found because it was not sought . on the other hand , trying to understand the mechanism for ferromagnetism is more fundamental .",
    "it points to the long - standing difficulty of building an understanding of the pam upon the better understood single impurity anderson model ( siam ) or the analogous problem of building an understanding of the kondo lattice model upon the better understood single kondo impurity problem .",
    "nozires addressed this later problem and proposed a reconciliation in terms of what he calls `` the exhaustion picture '' @xcite .",
    "we note that the electron densities near 1/4 filling place the work of noack and guerrero @xcite in the exhaustion regime .",
    "when the coulomb repulsion @xmath7 associated with the double occupancy of an orbital is large ( strong coupling ) , it is often argued that around 1/4 filling the pam behaves like a 1/2-filled one - band hubbard model . in two - dimensions",
    "this hubbard model has an antiferromagnetic ground - state generated by a superexchange interaction @xmath10 ( for the symmetric case ) where @xmath11 is the strength of the hybridization in the pam .",
    "it has also been established that the kondo lattice model and the hubbard model for strong coupling are isomorphic with particles in one becoming holes in the other @xcite .",
    "the relevance of the hubbard model gains additional support from nozires s long - standing argument that the dynamics of the screening clouds are described by an effective hubbard model .    because of these mappings , it is seems consistent to suggest the strong - coupling physics found by noack and guerrero would map onto the domain of a one - dimensional 1/2-filled hubbard model .",
    "the venerable theorem of lieb and mattis @xcite , however , excludes the possibility of the hubbard model ( with nearest neighbor hopping ) from showing ferromagnetism in one - dimension .",
    "their proof relied on the obvious ability to order the electrons along the chain .",
    "the two - band nature of the pam , however , prevents this ordering by allowing processes not possible in the hubbard model .",
    "a similar situation would occur for the two - legged hubbard model , if it in fact shows ferromagnetism .",
    "we will argue that in the two - dimensional pam these same processes are responsible for the ferromagnetism .",
    "they are rkky and nagaoka - like and are excluded in nozires s @xcite picture and tahvildar - zadeh _ et al . _",
    "s @xcite interpretation of it .",
    "it is important to remark that ferromagnetism in the pam is obtained for a large region of parameters which include realistic values .",
    "we will base our arguments on the predictions of effective hamiltonians generated from the pam by perturbation theory and the results of our qmc simulations .",
    "for the pam parameters studied , these effective hamiltonians suggest a paramagnetic or anti - ferromagnetic state at 1/4 filling , a ferromagnetic region between 1/4 and 3/8 filling , a rsdw at 3/8 filling , a paramagnetic region between 3/8 and 1/2 filling , and an antiferromagnetic state at 1/2 filling .",
    "we see all these features in the qmc simulations .    in the section  ii we will define the pam and sketch our derivation of the effective hamiltonians . in section",
    "iii we will summarize our numerical method , noting finite size limitations .",
    "our results will be presented in section  iv . in the section",
    "v , the concluding section , we will give a detailed contrast between our picture and select other works .",
    "the pam is described by the hamiltonian @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 create an electron with spin @xmath15 in @xmath16 and @xmath4 orbitals at site @xmath17 in a square lattice , and @xmath18 is the number operator for the @xmath4-electrons of spin @xmath19 at site @xmath17 .",
    "elsewhere we will use a similar notation to denote quantities like @xmath20 , the number operator of @xmath16-electrons .",
    "the lattice has @xmath21 sites and the hopping amplitude @xmath22 between @xmath16-orbitals is only to nearest - neighbor ( n. n. ) sites . the hopping amplitude @xmath11 hybridizes different orbitals on the same site .",
    "we used periodic boundary conditions .",

    "this band structure for @xmath25 is illustrated in fig .",
    "we note if @xmath6 becomes very negative ( doping way below the bottom of the lower band ) , @xmath29 approaches @xmath30 .",

    "the operators which create quasi - particles in the lower and upper bands are of the form @xmath36 with @xmath37    the symmetric pam , which has the electron filling @xmath38 and @xmath39 , has particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this symmetry is sufficient to prevent the fermion sign problem that plagues qmc simulations .",
    "such simulations , performed by veki ' c et al .",
    "@xcite , suggest the existence of a charge and spin gap for small values of @xmath7 with the spin gap disappearing when @xmath7 is increased to some @xmath40 . above @xmath41",
    "the system exhibits long - range anti - ferromagnetic order .    in a previous work we presented qmc results for the asymmetric model .",
    "qmc simulations for the asymmetric model experience a sign problem which is the reason why we used the constrained - path monte carlo method @xcite . for fixed values of @xmath6",
    ", we varied @xmath7 and hole - doped away from half - filling down to a filling of 3/8 . for a large enough value of @xmath7 we also found anti - ferromagnetism at 1/2 filling .",
    "this state was rapidly suppressed upon doping . at 3/8",
    "filling we saw a sharp peak appear in the spin - spin correlation at the wavenumbers @xmath42 and @xmath9 .",
    "we interpreted this peak as consequence of a state resonating between two degenerate spin - density waves characterized by reciprocal wavevectors @xmath9 and @xmath9 .",
    "in the present work we explore the doping range from 1/4 to 3/8 filling , arguing for a region of ferromagnetism .",
    "part of our arguments will be based on the properties of effective hamiltonians for two different regions of parameters used in the simulations .",
    "these hamiltonians will be derived in section  iv .",
    "we now summarize the the constrained - path monte carlo method .",
    "the constrained path monte carlo ( cpmc ) method is extensively described and benchmarked elsewhere @xcite . here",
    "we only discuss its basic strategy and approximation . in the cpmc method ,",
    "the ground - state wave function @xmath43 is projected from a known initial wave function @xmath44 by a branching random walk in an over - complete space of slater determinants @xmath45 .",
    "in such a space , we can write latexmath:[$|\\psi_0\\rangle = \\sum_\\phi \\chi(\\phi )     @xmath45 , called random walkers , which represent @xmath43 in the sense that their distribution is a monte carlo sampling of @xmath47 , that is , a sampling of the ground - state wave function .    more specifically , starting with some trial state @xmath44",
    ", we project out the ground state by iterating @xmath48 where @xmath49 is some guess of the ground - state energy .",
    "purposely @xmath50 is a small parameter so for @xmath51 we can write @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath11 are the kinetic and potential energies .    for the study at hand , the initial state @xmath44 is the direct product of two spin slater determinants , i.e. , @xmath54 because the kinetic energy is a quadratic form in the creation and destruction operators for each spin , the action of its exponential on the trial state is simply to transform one direct product of slater determinants into another .",
    "while the potential energy is not a quadratic form in the creation and destruction operators , its exponential is replaced by sum of exponentials of such forms via the discrete hubbard - stratonovich transformation @xmath55 provided @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "accordingly we re - express the iteration step as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the set of hubbard - stratonovich fields ( one for each lattice site ) , @xmath21 is the number of lattice sites , @xmath60 is the probability distribution for these fields , and @xmath61 is an operator function of these fields formed from the product of the exponentials of the kinetic and potential energies .    the monte carlo method is used to perform the multi - dimensional integration over the hubbard - stratonovich fields .",
    "it does so by generating a set of random walkers initialized by replicating @xmath44 many times .",
    "each walker is then propagated independently by sampling a @xmath62 from @xmath63 and propagating it with @xmath64 .",
    "after the propagation has `` equilibrated , '' the sum over the walkers provides an estimate of the ground - state wave function @xmath43 .    in practice",
    "we performed an importance - sampled random walk by using the transformed iterative equation @xmath65 in this equation @xmath66 thus importance sampling changes the probability distribution of the hubbard - stratonovich fields , biasing it towards the generation of states with large overlap with the initial state .",
    "the factor @xmath67 is the normalization constant for the new distribution .",
    "it is associated with the weight assigned to each walker and , the weight is used in a branching process to control the variance of the results .",
    "we will not discuss this process here .",
    "we used two different estimators for the expectation values of some observable @xmath68 .",
    "one is the mixed estimator @xmath69 and the other is the back - propagated estimator @xmath70 where @xmath43 is the qmc estimate of the ground state and @xmath71 is typically in the range of 20 to 40 . for observables that commute with the hamiltonian ,",
    "the mixed estimator is a very accurate one and converges to the exact answer as @xmath43 converges to exact ground state . for observables that do not commute with the hamiltonian , like correlation functions",
    ", the back - propagated estimator has been found to give very accurate estimates of ground - state properties .",
    "significant differences between the predictions of these two estimators often exist .",
    "to completely specify the ground - state wave function for a system of interacting electrons , only determinants satisfying @xmath72 are needed because @xmath43 resides in either of two degenerate halves of the slater determinant space , separated by a nodal surface @xmath73 that is defined by @xmath74 .",
    "the degeneracy is a consequence of both @xmath43 and @xmath75 satisfying schrdinger s equation .",
    "the sign problem occurs because walkers can cross @xmath73 as their orbitals evolve continuously in the random walk .",
    "asymptotically they populate the two halves equally , leading to an ensemble that has zero overlap with @xmath43 .",
    "if @xmath73 were known , we would simply constrain the random walk to one half of the space and obtain an exact solution of schrdinger s equation . in the constrained - path qmc method , without _ a priori _ knowledge of @xmath73 , we use a trial wave function @xmath44 and require @xmath76 .",
    "this is what is called the constrained - path approximation .",
    "the quality of the calculation clearly depends on the trial wave function @xmath44 .",
    "since the constraint only involves the overall sign of its overlap with any determinant @xmath45 , it seems reasonable to expect the results to show some insensitivity to @xmath44 . through extensive benchmarking on the hubbard model",
    ", it has been found that simple choices of this function can give very good results @xcite .",
    "besides as a starting point and as a condition constraining a random walker , we also use @xmath44 as an importance function . to reduce variance",
    ", we use @xmath77 to bias the random walk into those parts of slater determinant space that have a large overlap with the trial state . for all three uses of @xmath44 ,",
    "it clearly is advantageous to have @xmath44 approximate @xmath43 as closely as possible . only in the constraining of the path",
    "does @xmath78 generate an approximation .",
    "we constructed @xmath79 from the eigenstates of the non - interacting problem .",
    "because the z - component of the total spin angular momentum is a good quantum number , we could choose unequal numbers of up and down electrons to produce trial states and hence ground states with @xmath80 .",
    "whenever possible , we would simulate closed shells of up and down electrons , as such cases usually provided energy estimates with the least statistical error , but because we wanted to study the ground state energy as a function of @xmath81 , we frequently had to settle for just the up or down shell being closed . in some cases , the desired value of @xmath81 could not be generated from either shell being closed .",
    "also we would select the non - interacting states so @xmath44 would be translationally invariant , even if these states used did not all come from the fermi sea .",
    "the use of unrestricted hartree - fock eigenstates to generate @xmath82 instead of the non - interacting eigenstates generally produced no significant improvement in the results .",
    "our first effective hamiltonian explicitly targets cases where the lower band of the non - interacting model is very flat .",
    "such cases exist for @xmath83 . in this regime of parameters and",
    "around 1/4 filling , single electron occupancy of the f - states can occur because of the depth of the orbital state as opposed to the double occupancy penalty of the coulomb repulsion .",
    "we will begin by building wannier orbital operators @xcite for each band from the quasi - particle operators defined in ( [ alphak ] ) @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "rewriting @xmath25 in the wannier basis , we find that @xmath86 with @xmath87 @xmath25 is simply the sum of two hopping terms corresponding to the lower and the upper bands . by construction",
    ", no hybridization exists between these two bands .",
    "the cost for this simplification is non - zero hoppings @xmath88 and @xmath89 between any pair of wannier orbitals @xmath17 and @xmath90 in the same band .",
    "next we rewrite the interaction term @xmath91 in the wannier basis @xmath92 this expression appears more complex than the one in the original basis ; however , from it we can more conveniently derive a low energy effective hamiltonian for electron fillings less than 1/2 filling .    to do this",
    "we first require that @xmath93 , i.e. the system is a mott insulator for 1/4 filling , so we can initially consider a @xmath94 that does not have processes involving the upper band @xmath95 with @xmath96 . to identify more easily the physically different contributions , we rewrite the @xmath7 term to produce @xmath97 with @xmath98 where @xmath99 means that there are no repeated indices .",
    "we see that @xmath94 is an extended hubbard model with long range hoppings , a ferromagnetic exchange interaction , correlated hoppings , and a term which destroys a spin - anti - aligned pair of electrons in sites @xmath100 and @xmath101 and creates an anti - aligned pair at @xmath17 and @xmath102 .    again for a large range of parameters , the lower band of the pam is quite flat .",
    "if we regard @xmath30 as very large , we can taylor series expand eq .",
    "[ ukvk ] , substitute the result into eq .",
    "[ wannier ] , and obtain @xmath103 matrix elements for @xmath17 and @xmath90 beyond nearest neighbors ( n. n. ) are smaller by higher powers of @xmath104 .",
    "thus the wannier operator @xmath105 is predominately @xmath106 as the amplitudes @xmath107 and @xmath108 strongly decrease with the distance between @xmath17 and @xmath90 .    with these results",
    "we see that @xmath109 and @xmath110 are poportional to @xmath111 , while @xmath112 is proportional to @xmath113 .",
    "this means that we can neglect the last term of @xmath94 , @xmath114    in this one band hamiltonian the coulomb repulsion is no longer just on - site .",
    "its spatial extension depends on the spatial extension of the wannier orbitals .",
    "because of original form of this interaction , it still only affects singlet states , but these states can now be non - local .",
    "we note that even if @xmath115 this one - band model is in the strong - coupling regime : @xmath116 and @xmath117 if @xmath17 and @xmath90 are nearest neighbors so @xmath118 . in the new basis",
    "the narrow band appears narrower , the heavy fermions appear heavier , but the interaction experiences little renormalization .",
    "the non - locality is the origin of the ferromagnetic heisenberg term . in this term ,",
    "provided @xmath7 is not arbitrarily large , the ferromagnetic exchange interaction @xmath119 , however , is smaller than the antiferromagnetic super - exchange interaction which is of order @xmath120 .",
    "we remark is that the magnitude of the af interaction is very small . for this reason ,",
    "the lowest order terms involving the upper band are crucial to determine the magnetic phase of the system doped above 1/4 filling .",
    "these lowest order upper band processes come from terms in the eq .",
    "@xmath121 with one @xmath122 operator and can be written as @xmath123 with @xmath124 here the terms with @xmath125 can be neglected when the lower band is flat so we can rewrite eq .",

    "it is interesting to note that the origin of this ferromagnetic alignment is not an exchange mechanism but processes involving charge - transfer . to see",
    "this more clearly we show in the appendix that by using a schrieffer - wolff transformation we can reduce the multi - band term to an effective one band term    @xmath129    \\nonumber\\\\    & = & -4\\frac { u^2v^2 } { n|\\epsilon_f| } \\sum_{i , j , \\bold{k},\\sigma }    \\frac { n^{\\alpha}_{i\\sigma } n^{\\alpha}_{j\\sigma }    ( \\alpha_{i\\bar{\\sigma}}^\\dagger \\alpha^{}_{j\\bar{\\sigma}}+\\alpha_{j \\bar{\\sigma}}^\\dagger \\alpha^{}_{i\\bar{\\sigma } } ) }   { e^{+}_{\\bold{k}}- \\tilde \\epsilon_f - u } \\tilde { t}_{ij}(\\bold{k } ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath130 with @xmath131 .",

    "then it is clear that @xmath133 induces a ferromagnetic interaction between the localized @xmath4-state which comes from the itinerancy of the carriers trough the upper band .",

    ", the magnitude of the hopping @xmath135 is maximized at the same time the denominator @xmath136 is minimized ( tends to @xmath137 ) .",
    "the electrons can be added to @xmath138 states only if the background is ferromagnetic and , of course , opposite to the spin of the added electron .",

    "adding one electron more produced a pm state .",
    "this behavior with the doping of one and two electrons is reminiscent of nagaoka ferromagnetism and its instability in the @xmath192 nearest - neighbor - hopping hubbard model .",

    "the need for inter - band processes differentiates our mechanism from nagaoka s .",
    "we believe the disappearance of the fm with the second electron is not analogous to the known instability of the nagaoka state but rather is a finite - size effect .",
    "it is well documented that the shell structure of a finite - sized non - interacting problem is reflected in the behavior of the filling dependence of the energy in the interacting problem @xcite .",
    "at least to a first approximation , the chemical potential is constant in a shell and is discontinuous between such shells . according to our effective one - band model , if we were to add one electron to the 1/4-filled case , it would most effectively lower its kinetic energy by moving between oppositely aligned @xmath4-states by virtually hopping through a @xmath139 conduction ( upper ) band state .",
    "the pauli principle blocks , or frustrates , this process for a second electron of the same spin if finite - size effects make the @xmath193 states of the next shell energetically inappropriate : the second electron would have to enter the @xmath139 shell oppositely aligned with the first , and the ferromagnetic background of @xmath4-states can not accommodate the two different alignments .",

    "if this ratio had no clear minimum , then we used @xmath198 where @xmath199 is the number of lattice sites ( the number of @xmath4-orbitals ) and @xmath200 is the number of electrons .",
    "@xmath196 corresponds to 3/8 filling . instead of being a possibly a weak fm state",
    ", we argue that it is actually an unpolarized state rsdw state ; however , while we do not clearly see this state for the @xmath179 lattice , we clearly saw it for the @xmath180 lattice when @xmath201 @xcite .",
    "there is an important and subtle difference between the two lattices : our performance gain in constructing @xmath44 is based on using closed shell states of the _ non - interacting problem _ , and these states mix information about both the valent and conduction bands . for these states ,",
    "the @xmath196 singlet for @xmath202 is a half - filled shell , but the @xmath201 singlet for @xmath180 is a closed shell .",
    "this difference makes it much more difficult to see the rsdw state for the @xmath179 lattice .",
    "we emphasize that the shell in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is different .",
    "it is a remnant of a shell in the _ conduction _ band .",
    "we remark that our effective heisenberg models admits a rsdw state .",
    "in particular , within the effective heisenberg model , the ferromagnetic nature of the rkky exchange interaction depends on the volume enclosed by the fermi surface being small . increasing the number of electrons increases the volume , lengthens the * k*-vector for transfer across the fermi surface , and decreases the strength of the interaction until the fermi surface becomes unstable because of nesting .",
    "direct calculation of the fourier components of @xmath151 shows that it diverges close to nesting .",
    "the spatial pattern of this diverging fourier component corresponds the @xmath151 being zero if sites @xmath17 and @xmath90 are on different sublattices and behaving anti - ferromagnetically if the sites are on the same sublattice .",
    "this is precisely the pattern observed in the spin - spin correlation function reported in our previous work , but we do not see it for the @xmath179 lattice size .",
    "finite sizes effects and the limited range of system sizes we can afford to simulate have prevented us from performing the scaling analysis need to establish the rsdw state as one of long - range order .",
    "both the ferromagnetism and conduction band shell structure is evident for the @xmath180 case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . adding one electron to the 1/4 filled case ( @xmath203 ) produces a fm state . adding another closes the @xmath204 shell which frustrates the ferromagnetism . adding more electrons to reach @xmath205",
    "successively populates the @xmath206 and @xmath207 conduction band shells . at the middle of each shell",
    ", the energy difference is a maximum and the shell is half filled .",
    "our numerical results indicate that several important features of the phase diagram of the one dimensional pam@xcite are preserved in two dimensions . in both dimensions and for",
    "half - filling , the coulomb interaction induces an insulating gap , and the system can have af order ( af insulator ) , or it can remain in a paramagnetic state ( kondo insulator ) if there is a strong enough hybridization @xmath11 between both bands . in this latter case",
    "there is also a spin gap associated with the energy necessary to break a kondo singlet .",
    "the af order originates in the fermi surface nesting at @xmath208 .",
    "when doped away from half - filling , the system in two dimensions becomes paramagnetic . in one dimension , however , critical inconmensurate correlations peaked at @xmath209 develop .",
    "this can be understood with the effective heisenberg theory derived in section iv.b : the rkky interaction @xmath164 has a divergent fourier component at @xmath209 because there is nesting for any concentration of electrons .",
    "this results in a luttinger liquid with spin - spin correlations which are critical and peaked at @xmath209 .",
    "the situation is different in two dimensions where there is nesting only for fillings @xmath1 , @xmath210 , and close to 1/4 ( small fermi surface ) .",
    "our numerical evidence suggests that the system is paramagnetic between @xmath210 and @xmath1 filling . for @xmath210 filling , where the nesting appears at @xmath211 and @xmath8 , our cpmc results indicate the presence of a rsdw phase . in this phase , the two interpenetrating sublattices are decoupled , and there is af order in each .",
    "this spatial ordering can be also understood by considering the effective heisenberg theory for the pam : it is clear that in going from @xmath1 to @xmath0 filling the nearest neighbor rkky interaction changes its sign ( af close to @xmath1 and fm close to @xmath0 ) .",
    "a cancellation then must occur at some intermediate concentration .",
    "we can easily see that this intermediate filling is @xmath210 where there is nesting for two different wave vectors : @xmath212 and @xmath8 .",
    "these two transferred wave vectors give canceling contributions to the nearest neighbor rkky interactions .",
    "for instance , the nearest neigbhor in the @xmath213-direction will feel an antiferromagnetic interaction coming from @xmath214 and a ferromagnetic one of the same magnitude coming from @xmath211 . on the other hand ,",
    "the next nearest neighbors have an overall phase @xmath215 for both wave vectors ( constructive interference ) and the effective interaction is therefore af .",
    "this is the origin of the rsdw state obtained for @xmath210 filling .    by decreasing the filling below @xmath210 ,",
    "the cpmc results indicate that the system becomes paramagnetic again down to some critical filling beyond which non - saturated ferromagnetism appears . again",
    "this behavior is related to the nesting of the fermi surface .",
    "below @xmath210 filling there is no nesting down to some small concentration of conduction electrons near 1/4 filling where the fermi surface of the conduction electrons can be very well approximated by a small sphere and the wave vector @xmath216 connecting two different points is very close to zero . under these conditions ,",
    "the rkky interaction @xmath164 diverges with a negative value indicating the presence of a ferromagnetic instabilty .",
    "this mechanism is not the only one giving rise ferromagnetism in the pam for small concentrations of carriers . in the mott insulating regime ( @xmath217 ) where the one band effective model @xmath218 is a valid effective low energy theory , the ferromagnetism is related to the long range hopping processes involving charge virtually tranferring from the lower to the upper band .",
    "the relevance of these processes is related to the flatness of the lower band and the dispersive character of the upper one . without considering processes connecting the two different bands ( @xmath219 ) ,",
    "the effective one band hamiltonian is a an extended hubbard model ( the hopping is not restricted to nearest neighbors ) . due to the flatness of the lower band ,",
    "the effective ratio @xmath220 is very large , and the model is in a nagaoka - like region even for small values of the bare interaction @xmath7 .",
    "the relevant low energy scale which determines the magnetic ordering comes from the comparison between @xmath221 ( energy per link of the nagaoka state ) and @xmath222 ( energy per link of the af state ) . as this difference is extremely small , any other term added to the hamiltonian , which favors one of the two competitive phases , will be relevant .",
    "as we have explained in section iv.a , @xmath223 stabilizes the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "if the localized electrons are polarized in the same direction , the added carriers can gain energy from virtual processes transferring charge between @xmath134 states of the lower and the upper band .",
    "it is also important to make some additional comments about the finite size effects in our numerical results . in an infinite system",
    "it is necessary to have a finite critical concentration of electrons in order to induce the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "we argue that this must be the case because the gain in kinetic energy of the added particles must overcompensate the loss of magnetic energy of the localized electrons ( which is proportional to the system size ) .",
    "the numerical results show that the system becomes ferromagnetic with the addition of only one conduction electron .",
    "this is because one electron added to a @xmath224 or @xmath225 system corresponds to a finite concentration .",
    "besides , as it is explicitly shown in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] , there are closed shell effects that give a non - monotonic behavior for the energy difference between the ferromagnetic and the paramagnetic state as function of concentration .",
    "it is clear that for small systems and closed shell conditions , the non - interacting ( paramagnetic ) solution will be more stable under the introduction of correlations .",
    "the small systems will generally have larger energy gaps between two shells .",
    "due to size effects , we must assume that we are dealing with states of long - range order , and we can not say much about the order of the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic transitions . to estrablish long - range order and to determine the order of the transitions , it is necessary to scale the magnetization with the system size for a fixed filling . to do this",
