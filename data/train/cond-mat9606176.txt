    "since the discovery of high-@xmath0 superconductors ten years ago , the anomalous properties of their normal state have been the subject of intensive theoretical work .",
    "it is widely believed that a model of strongly correlated electrons already captures the basic ingredients of the relevant physics . in these models ,",
    "the correlations are represented by a strong local interaction @xmath1 .",
    "however , a coherent description of _ all _ anomalous properties on the basis of such a model is still lacking .",
    "the main problem is that exact calculations are generally feasible only in a small parameter regime and that most approximation schemes fail in capturing _ all _ aspects which are supposed to be important .",
    "the hall constant is especially hard to describe .",
    "one reason for this is that the hall conductivity contains a three - point correlation function after it has been expanded to first order in the magnetic field .",
    "then , the calculation of vertex corrections is a tough problem which , to our knowledge , has been attempted only in the case of a fermi liquid and to leading order in the quasiparticle damping @xcite .",
    "moreover , since the frequency dependent hall constant is given as a quotient of conductivities , the limit @xmath2 may be precarious due to resonances like the drude peak .",
    "a more technical peculiarity of the hall effect is due to the fact that the magnetic field is introduced via a vector potential which , formally , breaks the symmetry with respect to lattice translations .",
    "but even in the simplest case of a bloch - boltzmann description , the temperature dependence of the hall constant may be difficult to reproduce , because the relaxation time cancels once it is assumed to be independent of momentum .",
    "the measurements of the hall constant in high-@xmath0 materials @xcite reveal two major anomalous dependences : on temperature and on doping .",
    "both can not be understood within conventional band theory . for noninteracting tight - binding electrons on a two - dimensional square lattice , the hall constant changes sign at half filling as the fermi surface changes its shape from electronlike to holelike .",
    "in contrast , the hubbard model in the large-@xmath1 limit exhibits an additional sign change below half filling which is purely due to correlations @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the limit @xmath3 , i.e.  near half filling , the hall constant diverges according to a @xmath4 law @xcite .",
    "these properties are supposed to account for the doping dependence observed in , e.g. , la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 @xcite . as for the anomalous temperature dependence of the hall constant , the most striking features are : firstly , a strong decrease which is , in some cases , as fast as @xmath8 @xcite ; secondly , the lack of saturation above a fraction of the debye temperature , typically @xmath9 @xcite , in contrast to what is expected in a fermi liquid description with weak electron - phonon coupling @xcite ; and thirdly , a quadratic dependence of the hall angle on temperature for not too large dopings @xcite . in a fermi liquid , the temperature dependence arises from an anisotropic relaxation time @xcite .",
    "if we assume scattering off phonons to be the main inelastic process , a temperature dependence is conceivable only below a certain temperature scale : then , a sufficiently anisotropic fermi surface causes the scattering to be confined to those regions of the fermi surface , where small momentum transfers are possible . for high enough temperatures ,",
    "this kinematic restriction is lifted and the scattering becomes isotropic , thus leading to a cancellation of the relaxation time .",
    "the cross - over temperature is given by @xmath10 .",
    "the universally observed decrease of the hall constant as a function of temperature in almost all high-@xmath0 compounds up to temperatures clearly beyond this temperature scale must therefore be due to electronic correlations as well .    in the following ,",
    "we investigate the hall effect on the basis of the simplest model of strongly correlated electrons , namely the single - band hubbard model on a hypercubic lattice in @xmath11 dimensions with nearest - neighbour hopping .",
    "this model , along with mori s formalism used to represent the hall constant , is introduced in sec .",
    "ii . in this theory",
    ", the hall constant is given as the sum of its infinite frequency limit ( @xmath12 ) and a memory function contribution .",
    "the former term was first considered by shastry , shraiman and singh @xcite .",
    "our emphasis is on the memory function term which represents the deviation of the hall constant from @xmath12 for finite frequencies and thus can not be neglected when considering the case of zero frequency .",
    "the advantage of our representation of the hall constant is that we do not have to cope with a quotient of conductivities as opposed to the usual approaches .",
    "this is why the hall constant at low frequencies becomes less sensitive to the detailed resonance structure of the conductivities . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", this advantage is exploited for the range of weak to intermediate correlation strengths , while the opposite limit of strong correlations will be addressed in a forthcoming paper @xcite . in sec .",
    "iii , we proceed by calculating the memory function to second order in the hubbard interaction and to first order in the magnetic field .",
    "expansion with respect to the magnetic field leads to a decomposition of the memory function into two terms , namely a two - point and a three - point correlation function .",
    "both contributions are evaluated exactly in infinite spatial dimensions .",
    "our results indicate that the memory function term is important . only then , a precursor effect of the sign change of the hall constant as a function of doping appears even in perturbation theory . moreover , when extrapolating our results to @xmath1 values of the order of twice the free band width @xmath13 , we get most of the qualitative features observed in , e.g. , la@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7 : the sign change with respect to doping and the decrease of the hall constant up to unusually high temperatures , characteristic of most high-@xmath0 compounds . finally , in sec .",
    "iv , we summarize our main results .",
    "the single - band hubbard model on a d - dimensional hypercubic lattice in a magnetic field reads @xmath14 where the sum in the hopping term @xmath15 is restricted to nearest neighbours and @xmath16 is the hubbard repulsion .",
    "the peierls phase factor @xmath17 guarantees the gauge invariance @xcite and the sign of the charge @xmath18 is chosen to be negative . since",
    "only nearest neighbour hops are taken into account , we may approximate @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the lattice vector to site @xmath21 .",
    "the vector potential decomposes into two terms describing the electric and magnetic field , respectively : @xmath22 in linear response theory with respect to the electric field , the latter appears only in the definition of the current operator .",
    "more precisely , the current operator is defined as the following functional derivative : @xmath23 the homogeneous magnetic field is chosen to point in the @xmath24-direction and it is advantageous to fix the gauge from the very beginning according to the landau choice @xmath25 since then , translational symmetry is broken only in one dimension , namely the @xmath26-direction .",
    "@xmath27 is a primitive lattice vector .",
    "we need the current operator only up to first order in the magnetic field : @xmath28 here , @xmath29 is a nearest neighbour vector and the summation is over pairs of nearest neighbours .",
    "note , however , that due to the gauge fixation ( [ gauge ] ) , we can not choose periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath26-direction .",
    "thus , if @xmath29 points in the @xmath26-direction , we have to carry out the sums in such a way that the components @xmath30 and @xmath31 are simultaneously elements of the set consisting of the @xmath26-coordinates of all lattice sites , e.g.   @xmath32 . here",
    ", it is assumed that the lattice has @xmath33 sites in the @xmath26-direction which implies @xmath34 .",
    "of course , observable quantities are not allowed to depend on the lattice location @xmath35 .",
    "the hopping term is expanded analogously , yielding : @xmath36 the term without magnetic field , i.e.  eq .  ( [ freehopping ] ) , becomes diagonal in crystal momentum space with a band dispersion @xmath37 .      in this subsection , the basics of mori s memory function formalism is reviewed briefly .",
    "for further details , see e.g.  ref .",
    "the best known application of mori theory is the description of many particle systems in the hydrodynamic regime @xcite .",
    "there , one is only interested in the dynamics of the hydrodynamic variables .",
    "they are characterized by the fact that their transport is restricted by conservation laws or by broken symmetries .",
    "thus , they are bound to vary on a time scale that is very slow in comparison to that of all the other degrees of freedom .",
    "now , the mori theory enables one to separate these two time scales : the equations of motion of the hydrodynamic variables take on the form of coupled integro - differential equations .",
    "the corresponding integral kernels of these so called mori equations are memory functions in which the influence of all the other degrees of freedom is accumulated , hence the name `` memory function '' . in this context of hydrodynamics ,",
    "the memory functions are rapidly varying functions , whose effect may be simulated by damping constants .",
    "then , the mori equations take on a form analogous to that of the langevin equation for a particle undergoing brownian motion",
    ". however , the validity of the mori equations is not restricted to the special set of hydrodynamic variables . in the simplest case ,",
    "one sets up the mori theory for those observables that constitute the correlation functions one is interested in .",
    "this leads to representations for the unknown correlation functions in terms of memory functions in which all analytic properties are fulfilled by construction . on the other hand",
    ", it may be difficult to find an approximate expression for a given memory function .      the _ liouville space _",
    "@xmath38 is defined as the linear vector space over the field of complex numbers whose elements are the linear operators in the familiar hilbert space of quantum mechanics , and where the usual operations like scalar multiplication etc .",
    "hold . in this liouville space",
    "exist linear operators that are called _ superoperators _ to distinguish them from the usual ones .",
    "( henceforth , normal operators are denoted with a hat , superoperators not . )",
    "the most important superoperator is the _ liouville operator _ @xmath39 , which maps a given operator onto its commutator with the hamiltonian : @xmath40\\,.\\ ] ] an other important class of superoperators are _",
    "superprojectors_. however , their definition implies a scalar product in @xmath38 . in the context of response functions ,",
    "the most convenient scalar product turns out to be the so called _ mori product _",
    "@xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the thermal average and @xmath43 is the inverse temperature . on the basis of this scalar product , we may now speak of adjoint superoperators @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and thus of unitary and hermitian ones in the usual sense .",
    "the projector @xmath46 that projects onto the subspace of @xmath38 spanned by linearly independent elements @xmath47 , reads : @xmath48 where the metric @xmath49 is the inverse of the matrix @xmath50 , i.e.  @xmath51 .",
    "in fact , this implies the idempotence property @xmath52 .",
    "finally , the definition of the mori product implies the validity of the so called kubo identity @xmath53>\\ ; , \\label{kubo}\\ ] ] which will play an important role .      from eq .",
    "( [ kubo ] ) follows a representation for the current - current correlation function @xmath54 , defined as the laplace transform of @xmath55>$ ] : @xmath56 here , @xmath24 is a complex frequency , which ultimately has to be specialized to @xmath57 . for formal manipulations , however , it is more convenient to deal with the complex frequency @xmath24 rather than with @xmath58 .",
    "the last expression has to be inserted into the kubo formula for the conductivity tensor , @xmath59 where @xmath60 arises from the equilibrium part of the current and is defined as the second functional derivative of the hamiltonian with respect to the external electric field : @xmath61 in the hubbard model ( [ hubbard ] ) , its expectation value is given as @xmath62 , i.e.  as the average kinetic energy per dimension .",
    "using the fact @xmath63 which holds for a metal in the normal state , we show that @xmath60 also equals the static susceptibility @xmath64 , defined through @xmath65 : @xmath66 thus , the conductivity tensor may be written as @xmath67 in order to represent the relaxation functions @xmath68 in terms of memory functions , we introduce the superprojector @xmath46 that projects onto the subspace of @xmath38 spanned by the current operators @xmath69 and @xmath70 : @xmath71 and the complementary superprojector @xmath72 . by making use of the operator identity @xmath73 with @xmath74 and @xmath75 , we find : @xmath76 the terms in the last equation are the frequency and the memory matrix , respectively : @xmath77>\\ ; , \\label{frequency}\\\\   m_{\\mu\\nu}(z)&\\equiv&\\frac{\\beta}{\\chi^0}(ql\\hat{j}_{\\mu}|                      \\frac{i}{z+qlq}|ql\\hat{j}_{\\nu } ) \\label{memory}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last equation shows that the dynamics of the memory functions is governed by @xmath78 rather than @xmath39 . solving eq .",
    "( [ relax1 ] ) for the matrix @xmath79 leads to @xmath80 together with eq .",
    "( [ cond ] ) , this demonstrates that the mori theory enables us to calculate directly the resistivity tensor .",
    "therefore , the desired representation for the dynamical hall constant can be read off from the last equation : @xmath81 since the memory function term will be shown to vanish in the high frequency limit as @xmath82 , the first term represents the high frequency limit of the hall constant considered by shastry et al .",
    "@xcite : @xmath83 moreover , @xmath84 is the generalization of the cyclotron frequency to the lattice case . therefore , within a boltzmann equation approach , only the term ( [ r_hinfty ] ) is considered .",
    "the goal of the subsequent sections is to investigate the memory function term @xmath85 for finite frequencies .",
    "the analytic properties of @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ hall ] ) may all be derived on the basis of eq .",
    "( [ memory ] ) .",
    "an alternative procedure is to solve eq .",
    "( [ relax2 ] ) for @xmath87 and go back to the analytic properties of the current susceptibilities @xmath88 , cf .",

    "@xmath86 reads in terms of the susceptibilities @xmath88 : @xmath89>}{\\chi^0}\\;. \\label{memsus}\\ ] ] from time reversal invariance , homogenity of time and the fact that the current operators are hermitian , we may deduce the following symmetry properties @xcite : @xmath90 together with eq .",
    "( [ memsus ] ) , this implies : @xmath91 @xmath86 can be represented as a spectral integral @xmath92 where the spectral function @xmath93 is given by the discontinuity across the real axis : @xmath94 from the analytic properties ( [ memprop1 ] ) , it follows that @xmath95 and @xmath93 are real functions satisfying @xmath96 thus , two further conclusions can be drawn : firstly , only even powers in @xmath97 contribute to the high frequency expansion of @xmath86 . and",
    "secondly , the quotient @xmath98 must be integrable around @xmath99 , @xmath100 which can be seen from the fact that the dc - hall constant contains this integral .",
    "note , that we need not understand this expression as a principal value integral due to the fact that the integrand is even .",
    "despite many interesting works on the normal state hall effect of high-@xmath0 superconductors , a calculation that incorporates all the complicated many - body correlations exactly within a microscopic model is still lacking .",
    "the following treatment of the hall constant closes this gap at least in the perturbation - theoretical regime .",
    "on the other hand , the relevant parameter regime is believed to be the strong correlation limit rather than the weak one .",
    "however , it turns out that the final expression may well describe the observed dependencies on temperature and on doping at least qualitatively , if we allow @xmath1 to be extrapolated to values of the order of the free band width @xmath13 .",
    "thus , a precursor effect of the anomalous dependences clearly shows up even in the regime of weak correlations .",
    "the perturbation - theoretical treatment of the hall constant is by no means straightforward .",
    "as is well known , the evaluation of response functions like @xmath88 of eq .",
    "( [ currcorr ] ) by expansion in a small interaction parameter fails because , as an artefact of such an expansion , these functions become singular for small frequencies @xmath24 .",
    "this difficulty was resolved by gtze and wlfle @xcite some time ago by means of a memory function approach .",
    "they calculated the memory function perturbatively , which , at first , is valid only at high enough frequencies .",
    "it turns out , however , that their expression for the memory function depends only smoothly on frequency below a certain frequency scale and tends to a constant in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , in their approximation scheme the correct resonance structure of the studied response functions is inherently built in .",
    "thus , their results could be used in the whole frequency regime including the hydrodynamic one .",
    "however , we can not carry over their analysis straightforwardly to the present problem , because otherwise , we would encounter a spurious singularity in the limit that is of most interest , i.e.   @xmath2 .    in this subsection",
    ", we identify the precondition which is necessary to obtain regular expressions in this limit and that was fulfilled trivially in the applications of ref .",
    "@xcite but is not in our case . since this condition does not affect the correct description of the local interaction @xmath1 , we may take it as an approximation . by using mori s formalism , we shall see that once this condition is assumed to be satisfied no further approximations have to be made .",
    "this last point can not be seen in the more intuitive introduction of the memory function concept as given in ref .",
    "@xcite and shows that the extrapolation to low frequencies therein is exact .",
    "+ perturbation theory is based on the following decomposition of the liouville operator : @xmath101 where @xmath102 and @xmath103 are assigned to the hopping and interaction term of the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) , respectively .",
    "the perturbation - theoretical regime is given by the condition @xmath104 , where @xmath13 is the width of the free band and thus represents the characteristic energy scale introduced by @xmath102 .",
    "the precondition to obtain a regular expression for the memory function @xmath86 for all frequencies to leading order in @xmath1 is that the relevant operators @xmath69 and @xmath70 span a subspace of @xmath38 that is invariant with respect to actions of @xmath102 @xcite . if this condition were satisfied in our case , it would take on the form @xmath105=\\hat{j}_{\\mu}^{(0)}\\ ;                                         \\omega_{\\mu\\nu}^0\\ , , \\label{appr}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 and summation over repeated indices is implied .",

    "the complicated expressions obtained for these two functions were simplified considerably by invoking the limit of infinite spatial dimensions . while this approximation still catches the impact of the correlations , it smoothes out effects of low dimensionality . except for the doping dependence of the hall constant in the vicinity of half filling ,",
