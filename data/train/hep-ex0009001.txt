    "in previous papers@xcite super - kamiokande reported evidence for the oscillation of muon neutrinos produced in cosmic - ray induced showers in the atmosphere .",
    "this evidence rests largely upon a strong zenith angle dependent deficit in the muon data , which does not appear in the electron data , and hence limits the amount of oscillation into electron neutrinos .",
    "in fact , the results only demonstrate that muon neutrinos are disappearing , depending on the energy and flight distance .",
    "the most plausible scenario is that muon neutrinos oscillate to tau neutrinos , most of which are below the 3.4 gev neutrino energy threshold for charged current tau production .",
    "the few charged current tau events created ( we expect approximately 65 in our current sample ) typically fail our cuts that identify a single electron or muon ; indeed , due to the high energy of the interaction and the multiple decay modes of the tau , it is difficult to isolate any set of events that can be uniquely identified as due to charged current @xmath29 interactions .    an alternative scenario that can explain muon neutrino disappearance",
    "is oscillation with a sterile neutrino ( @xmath30 ) , so named because it has neither charged current ( cc ) nor neutral current ( nc ) interactions .",
    "neutrino oscillation has also been employed to explain two other experimental anomalies : the long - standing deficit of solar neutrinos@xcite , and the appearance of electron antineutrinos in the lsnd experiment@xcite .",
    "the three oscillation signatures , lsnd , atmospheric , and solar , are manifested by three widely separated values of the mass - squared difference , @xmath31 . because @xmath32 must equal @xmath33 , all three signatures can not be accommodated with three neutrino states .",
    "any additional light neutrino must be sterile to satisfy the well - known bound of three neutrino flavors that couple to the @xmath34@xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we use more than 1000 days exposure of atmospheric neutrino data collected by the super - kamiokande detector to distinguish the behavior of @xmath35 oscillation from @xmath36 oscillation . first",
    ", for @xmath36 oscillation , one should observe fewer neutral current events than for @xmath37 oscillation ; in the latter case the neutral current event rate is unchanged by oscillations .",
    "second , the interaction of the neutrinos with matter@xcite leads to a difference in the oscillation probability .",
    "the coherent forward scattering of @xmath29 and @xmath38 are identical , therefore the presence of matter in the neutrino path does not modify the oscillation probability for a neutrino of energy @xmath39 that travels a distance @xmath40 in vacuum : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the mixing angle between the two neutrino states , and @xmath43 in vacuum is given by @xmath44 = @xmath45 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath30 does not interact with matter by definition , whereas @xmath38 does interact with matter via the neutral current .",
    "this introduces an effective potential which modifies the mixing angle and oscillation length@xcite : @xmath46 the parameter @xmath47 is given by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the neutron density in the matter traversed by the neutrino , the minus sign is for neutrinos , and the plus sign is for antineutrinos . for the density of matter in the earth",
    ", @xmath47 reaches unity for @xmath39 of 5 gev @xmath50 .",
    "the super - kamiokande data indicates a likely value for @xmath51 of @xmath52 , which means that neutrinos with energy greater than approximately 15 gev will have the oscillation probability suppressed by matter effects if the oscillation is @xmath36 .",
    "neutrinos of lower energy will have approximately the same oscillation probability in matter as in vacuum , even if the oscillation is @xmath36 .",
    "super - kamiokande is a 50 kilotons water cherenkov detector employing 11,146 photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) to monitor an internal detector ( i d ) fiducial volume of 22.5 kilotons .",
    "incoming and outgoing charged particles are identified by 1885 pmts in an optically isolated outer volume ( od ) .",
    "details of the detector , calibrations , and data reduction can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "super - kamiokande has collected 9178 fully - contained ( fc ) events and 665 partially - contained ( pc ) events in a 70.5 kiloton - year ( 1144 days ) exposure , starting in april 1996 .",
    "fc events deposit all of their cherenkov light in the i d while pc events have exiting tracks which deposit some cherenkov light in the od .",
    "the vertex position is reconstructed and the number of cherenkov rings are counted using pmt pulse height and timing information .",
    "the directions and momenta are reconstructed and the particle types are identified as `` @xmath53-like '' or `` @xmath54-like '' for each cherenkov ring . in the current fc sample , there are 3107 single - ring @xmath53-like events , 2988 single - ring @xmath54-like events and 3083 multi - ring events .",
    "this detector has also collected 1269 upward through - going muon ( utm ) events during 1138 live days .",
    "muons which leave both entrance and exit signal clusters in the od are regarded as through - going muon events ; those that are upward going are produced by atmospheric neutrino interactions in the surrounding rock .",
    "we required a minimum track length of 7 meters in the inner detector ( corresponding to a minimum muon energy of 1.6  gev ) and a zenith angle @xmath55 ( @xmath56 means vertically upward - going events ) .",
    "because of finite fitter resolution and multiple coulomb scattering of muons in the nearby rock , some down - going cosmic - ray muons appear to be coming from @xmath57 .",
    "this background was estimated to be @xmath58 events @xcite , which was subtracted from the most horizontal bin .",
    "first , utilizing only the fc single - ring events , we have examined the hypotheses of two - flavor @xmath59 and @xmath60 oscillation models using a @xmath61 comparison of our data and monte carlo ( mc ) , allowing all important mc parameters to vary , weighted by their expected uncertainties . for @xmath60 ,",
    "the effects of matter on neutrino propagation through the earth were taken into account by a numerical evolution where the density of the earth was divided into 94 discrete steps in radius based on ref.@xcite .",
    "furthermore , matter effects are different with positive or negative @xmath51 except for full mixing case .",
    "therefore , we evaluate three models of oscillation , ( a ) @xmath35 , ( b ) @xmath62 , and ( c ) @xmath63 .",
    "the data were binned by particle type , momentum , and @xmath64 . a @xmath61",
    "is defined as :    @xmath65    where the sum is over five bins equally spaced in @xmath66 and seven ( six ) momentum bins for @xmath53-like ( @xmath54-like ) events .",
    "@xmath67 is the measured number of events in each bin , @xmath68 is the statistical error , and @xmath69 is the weighted sum of mc events .",
    "the definition of @xmath70 , and the treatment of systematic uncertainties , @xmath71 , is identical to that in ref .",
    "@xcite , except we exclude the pc events ( which we employ later in the present report ) .",
    "the best - fit values of oscillation parameters are summarized in table [ tab : fcfits ] . with the best fit parameters for @xmath72 ,",
    "we expect only 16 single - ring events from @xmath73 charged current interactions in the current sample . moreover , matter induced modifications to oscillations do not produce significant effects due to the relatively small energy ( @xmath74  1  gev ) of the parent neutrinos for the fc events .",
    "therefore these three hypotheses for oscillations are indistinguishable by this data sample alone .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      next we employ a neutral current ( nc ) enriched sample of events selected from multi - ring ( mr ) data . by definition",
    "a sterile neutrino does not interact with matter even through the neutral current channel , while a tau neutrino continues to experience the same neutral current interactions as did the original muon neutrino .",
    "we measure the zenith angle distribution of nc events to distinguish between @xmath72 and @xmath60 : if pure @xmath59 oscillations are operating , then the up / down ratio should be nearly unity ; if @xmath60 oscillations dominate , the up / down ratio will be measurably smaller .    in order to obtain a sample with an enhanced with nc events , we applied the following selection criteria : ( 1 ) vertex within the fiducial volume and no exiting track ; ( 2 ) multiple cherenkov rings ; ( 3 ) particle identification of the brightest ring is @xmath53-like ; ( 4 ) visible energy greater than 400  mev .",
    "the first criterion provides a contained event sample , the second and third criteria serve to enrich the nc event fraction .",
    "the fourth criterion helps to obtain good angular correlation between the incident neutrino and the reconstructed direction , defined as the charge weighted sum of the ring directions .",
    "the mean angle difference between the parent neutrino and reconstructed directions is estimated to be @xmath75 . according to our mc study , for no oscillations ( and @xmath59 oscillations at best fit parameters ) , the resultant fraction of nc events is 29% ( 30% ) , @xmath76cc is 46% ( 48% ) and @xmath77cc is 25% ( 19% ) ( and @xmath73cc is 3% ) . in contrast",
    "the fc single ring sample contains only @xmath78 nc events . in the current exposure ,",
    "1531 events satisfy the above criteria .",
    "figure [ fig : mr](a ) shows the zenith angle distribution of these events with predictions from the mc .",
    "we utilize an up - to - down ratio as the discriminant , which cancels some systematic uncertainties ( otherwise dominated by the large uncertainty in absolute rates ) . in this context we define `` upward '' as a cosine of zenith angle less than @xmath790.4 , and `` downward '' as greater than + 0.4",
    ". there are 387 upward events and 404 downward events .",
    "figure [ fig : mr](b ) shows the @xmath80 dependence of the expected up / down ratio in the case of full mixing ( @xmath81 . for @xmath51 of @xmath82",
    "ev@xmath83 , the data are consistent with @xmath72 , while the data differ from the prediction for @xmath60 oscillation by 2.4 standard deviations .",
    "we estimated the total uncertainty in the up / down ratio of the data and mc to be @xmath84 , dominated by the 2.6% uncertainty in the neutrino flux caused by the absorption of muons in the mountain above the detector .",
    "all other sources of systematic uncertainty such as background contamination , the up / down response of the detector , the uncertainty of the nc cross sections , and the difference between the up / down ratio of two independent flux calculations@xcite are less than 1% .",
    "next we report on the search for matter effects by using high energy partially contained events .",
    "as discussed above , matter effects impact only @xmath60 oscillations , where at high energies the matter effect suppresses oscillations .",
    "partially contained events in super - kamiokande are estimated to be 97% pure @xmath38 charged current , with a mean neutrino energy of 10 gev . in order to select higher energy @xmath38 events , which are more sensitive to matter effects , we additionally require visible energy greater than 5  gev . we estimate the typical energy of the parent atmospheric neutrino is 20  gev .",
    "after cuts are made upon the current data sample we find 267 events .",
    "figure [ fig : mr](c ) shows the zenith angle distribution of these events with predictions from mc , as before .",
    "again we employ an up / down ratio to cancels systematic uncertainties , with the same angular definition as used for the multi - ring sample .",
    "there are 43 `` upward '' events and 84 `` downward '' events .",
    "figure [ fig : mr](d ) shows the @xmath80 dependence of expected up / down ratio in the case of full mixing .",
    "for @xmath51 of @xmath85  ev@xmath83 , the data are consistent with @xmath72 oscillation , whereas it differs from @xmath60 oscillation by 2.3 standard deviations .",
    "we estimated the total systematic uncertainty in the up / down ratio to be @xmath86 , dominated by the @xmath87 uncertainty caused by the mountain above the detector and the @xmath88 uncertainty caused by possible background contamination by cosmic - ray muons .",
    "all other sources of uncertainty were less than @xmath89 .",
    "next we report on the search for possible matter effects by using upward through - going muon events .",
    "the approach of this analysis is similar to that for the pc events .",
    "because the typical energy of the utm parent neutrino is approximately 100  gev , matter effect suppression should appear most prominently in this data set with a relatively large uncertainty at the horizon@xcite limits their usefulness and they are not considered . ] .",
    "in the current sample , we have 1259.9 events after background subtraction .",
    "figure [ fig : mr](e ) shows the zenith angle distribution of these events with predictions .",
    "again we utilize a ratio as the test parameter , dividing `` vertical '' and `` horizontal '' at cosine of zenith angle @xmath90 .",
    "figure [ fig : mr](f ) shows the @xmath80 dependence of the expected vertical / horizontal ratio in the case of full mixing . at the point of @xmath82  ev@xmath83 , the data are consistent with @xmath72 oscillation , while @xmath91 oscillation differs from the data by 2.9 standard deviations .",
    "we estimated the total systematic uncertainty in the horizontal / vertical flux ratio to be @xmath92 , dominated by the 3% uncertainty in the @xmath93 production ratio in the cosmic - ray interaction in the atmosphere .",
    "all other sources ofsystematic uncertainty , including the background contamination in the most horizontal bin@xcite , the spectral index of the neutrino flux , and the difference between two independent flux calculations@xcite were 1% or less .",
    "finally , we performed a combined statistical analysis of the multi - ring , high energy partially contained , and upward - going muon data sets . for each sample ( @xmath94 mr , pc , utm ) we construct a one degree of freedom @xmath95 defined by : @xmath96 where a is respectively",
    "either up - going or vertical and b is down - going or horizontal .",
    "for the utm sample , the calculated flux is used in place of the number of events .",
    "the parameter denoting normalization is @xmath97 , and for each ratio we introduce a systematic uncertainty parameter @xmath98 , weighted by the estimated size of the uncertainty , @xmath99 .",
    "the three @xmath100 are summed to form a total @xmath101 with three degrees of freedom .",
    "the value of @xmath101 is used as a hypothesis test for the cases of @xmath37 and @xmath36 oscillation .",
    "we exclude regions in the @xmath102 plane at the 90(99)% c.l . if the value of @xmath70 is greater than 6.3(11.3 ) for @xmath70 of three degrees of freedom .",
    "figure [ fig : combi ] shows separately the excluded regions for these three alternative oscillation modes , along with the allowed region from fc single ring event analysis . and",
    "@xmath103 are treated continuously@xcite , using the minimum @xmath70 for the @xmath104 fit which was slightly lower for the case of @xmath105 , and this was used to draw the contours for both cases .",
    "] one sees that the parameters allowed by the fc data in the @xmath102 plane are excluded at the 99% confidence level by the independent tests for both positive and negative @xmath51 sterile neutrino oscillations .",
    "in summary , we have presented three independent data samples that discriminate between the oscillations to either tau neutrinos or sterile neutrinos in the region of mixing angle and @xmath51 preferred by the majority of the super - kamiokande data .",
    "two - flavor oscillation between muon neutrinos and sterile neutrinos fit the low energy charged current data , but do not fit the neutral current or high energy data .",
    "we can not exclude more complicated scenarios in which both @xmath59 and @xmath106 oscillations co - exist with small mixing to sterile neutrinos , or with much smaller mass difference for sterile neutrinos ; yet there is nothing in this data to encourage one about the existence of sterile neutrinos .",
    "pure @xmath107 neutrino oscillations fit all of the data samples presented , without any inconsistency .",
