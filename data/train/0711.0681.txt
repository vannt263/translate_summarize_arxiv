    "plasmas are ionized gas mixtures , either magnetized or not , that have many practical applications . for instance",
    ", lightning is a well - known natural plasma and has been studied for many years  @xcite .",
    "a second application is encountered in hypersonic flows ; when a spacecraft enters into a planetary atmosphere at hypervelocity , the gas temperature and pressure strongly rise through a shock wave , consequently , dissociation and ionization of the gas particles occur in the shock layer .",
    "hypersonic flow conditions are reproduced in dedicated wind - tunnels such as plasmatrons , arc - jet facilities , and shock - tubes  @xcite .",
    "a third example was found about two decades ago , when large - scale electrical discharges were discovered in the mesosphere and lower ionosphere above large thunderstorms ; these plasmas are now commonly referred to as sprites  @xcite .",
    "fourth , discharges at atmospheric pressure have received renewed attention in recent years due to their ability to enhance the reactivity of a variety of gas flows for applications ranging from surface treatment to flame stabilization and ignition ( see  @xcite and references cited therein ) .",
    "fifth , hall thrusters are being developed to replace chemical systems for many on - orbit propulsion tasks on communications and exploration spacecraft  @xcite .",
    "finally , two important applications of magnetized plasmas are the laboratory thermonuclear fusion  @xcite and the magnetic reconnection phenomenom in astrophysics  @xcite .",
    "depending on the magnitude of the ratio of the reference particle mean free path to the system characteristic length ( knudsen number ) , two different approaches are generally followed to describe the transport of mass , momentum , and energy in a plasma  @xcite : either a particle approach at high values of the knudsen number ( solution to the boltzmann equation using monte carlo methods ) , or a fluid approach at low values ( solution to macroscopic conservation equations by means of computational fluid dynamics methods ) . in this work , we study plasmas that can be described by a fluid approach , thus encompassing most of the above - mentioned applications . in this case , kinetic theory can be used to obtain the governing conservation equations and transport fluxes of plasmas .",
    "hence , closure of the problem is realized at the microscopic level by determining from experimental measurements either the potentials of interaction between the gas particles , or the cross - sections .",
    "a complete model of plasmas shall allow for the following physical phenomena to be described    * thermal non equilibrium of the translational energy , * influence of the electromagnetic field , * occurrence of reactive collisions , * excitation of internal degrees of freedom .",
    "so far , no such unified model has been derived by means of kinetic theory .",
    "besides , a derivation of the mathematical structure of the conservation equations also appears to be crucial in the design of the associated numerical methods . based on our previous work ,",
    "we investigate in the present study the thermal nonequilibrium of the translational energy  @xcite and the influence of the magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "we generalize the chapman - enskog method within the context of a dimensional analysis of the boltzmann equation , emphasizing the role of a multiscale perturbation parameter on the collisional operator , the streaming operator , and the collisional invariants of the boltzmann equation .",
    "then , we obtain macroscopic equations eventually leading to a sound entropy structure . moreover , the system of equations is shown to be conservative and the purely convective system hyperbolic .",
    "let us now describe in more detail how these issues are currently addressed in the literature .",
    "first , a multiscale analysis is essential to resolve the boltzmann equation governing the velocity distribution functions .",
    "we recall that a fluid can be described in the continuum limit provided that the knudsen number is small . besides",
    ", in the case of plasmas , a thermal nonequilibrium may occur between the velocity distribution functions of the electrons and heavy particles ( atoms , molecules , and ions ) , given the strong disparity of mass between both types of species .",
    "ergo , the square root of the ratio of the electron mass to a characteristic heavy - particle mass represents an additional small parameter to be accounted for in the derivation of an asymptotic solution to the boltzmann equation .",
    "literature abounds with expressions of the scaling for the perturbative solution method .",
    "for instance , significant results are given in references  @xcite . yet , petit and darrozes  @xcite have suggested that the only sound scaling is obtained by means of a dimensional analysis of the boltzmann equation .",
    "subsequently , degond and lucquin  @xcite have established a formal theory of epochal relaxation based on such a scaling . in their study , the mean velocity of the electrons is shown to vanish in an inertial frame . moreover , the heavy - particle diffusive fluxes were scarcely dealt with since their work is restricted to a single type of heavy particles , and thus no multicomponent diffusion was to be found ; in such a simplified context , the details of the interaction between the heavy particles and electrons degenerate and the positivity of the entropy production is straightforward .",
    "we will establish a theory based on a multiscale analysis for a multicomponent plasma ( which includes the single heavy - particle case ) where the mean electron velocity is the mean heavy - particle velocity in absence of external forces . as an alternative , magin and degrez  @xcite",
    "have also proposed a model for a multicomponent plasma based on a hydrodynamic referential .",
    "they have applied a multiscale analysis to the derivation of the multicomponent transport fluxes and coefficients .",
    "however , the proposed treatment of the collision operators is heuristic .",
    "moreover , since the hydrodynamic velocity is used to define the referential instead of the mean heavy - particle velocity , the chapman - enskog method requires a transfer of lower order terms in the integral equation for the electron perturbation function to ensure mass conservation . finally , we also emphasize that the development of models for plasmas in thermal equilibrium shall always be obtained as a particular case of the general theory .",
    "second , the magnetic field induces anisotropic transport fluxes when the electron collision frequency is lower than the electron cyclotron frequency of gyration around the magnetic lines .",
    "braginskii  @xcite has studied the case of fully ionized plasmas composed of one single ion species .",
    "recently , bobrova @xmath1 have generalized the previous work to multicomponent plasmas . however",
    ", the scaling used in both contributions does not comply with a dimensional analysis of the boltzmann equation .",
    "lucquin  @xcite has investigated magnetized plasmas in the latter framework .",
    "nevertheless , the same limitation is found for the diffusive fluxes as in reference  @xcite .",
    "finally , giovangigli and graille  @xcite have studied the enskog expansion of magnetized plasmas and obtained macroscopic equations together with expressions of transport fluxes and coefficients .",
    "unfortunately , the difference of mass between the electrons and heavy particles is not accounted for in their work .",
    "third , plasmas are strongly reactive gas mixtures .",
    "the kinetic mechanism comprises numerous reactions  @xcite : dissociation of molecules by electron and heavy - particle impact , three body recombination , ionization by electron and heavy - particle impact , associative ionization , dissociative recombination , radical reactions , charge exchange@xmath2 giovangigli and massot  @xcite have derived a formal theory of chemically reacting flows for the case of neutral gases .",
    "subsequently , giovangigli and graille  @xcite have studied the case of ionized gases .",
    "we recall that their scaling does not take into account the mass disparity between electrons and heavy particles . besides , in chemical equilibrium situations , a long - standing theoretical debate in the literature deals with nonuniqueness of the two - temperature saha equation .",
    "recently , giordano and capitelli  @xcite have emphasized the importance of the physical constraints imposed on the system by using a thermodynamic approach . a derivation based on kinetic theory should further improve the understanding of the problem .",
    "choquet and lucquin  @xcite have already studied the case of ionization reactions by electron impact .",
    "fourth , molecules rotate and vibrate , and moreover , the electronic energy levels of atoms and molecules are excited . generally , the rotational energy mode is considered to be fully excited above a few kelvins . in a plasma environment ,",
    "the vibrational and electronic energy modes are also significantly excited .",
    "the detailed treatment of the internal degrees of freedom is however beyond the scope of the present contribution where we will only tackle the translational energy in the context of thermal nonequilibrium .",
    "the reader is thus referred to the specialized literature  @xcite .",
    "fifth , the development of numerical methods to solve conservation equations relies on the identification of their intrinsic mathematical structure .",
    "for instance , the system of conservation equations of mass , momentum , and energy is found to be nonconservative for thermal nonequilibrium ionized gases .",
    "therefore , this formulation is not suitable for numerical approximations of discontinuous solutions .",
    "coquel and marmignon  @xcite have derived a well - posed conservative formulation based on a phenomenological approach .",
    "nevertheless , their derivation is not consistent with a scaling issued from a dimensional analysis .",
    "we will show that kinetic theory , based on first principles , naturally allows for an adequate mathematical structure to be obtained , as opposed to the phenomenological approach .    in this work ,",
    "we propose to derive the multicomponent plasma conservation equations of mass , momentum , and energy , as well as the expressions of the associated multicomponent transport fluxes and coefficients .",
    "the multicomponent navier - stokes regime is reached for the heavy particles , which follow a hyperbolic scaling , and is coupled to first order drift - diffusion equations for the electrons , which follow a parabolic scaling .",
    "we deal here with first - order equations , thus one order beyond the expansion commonly investigated for the electrons in the literature .",
    "the derivation relies on kinetic theory and is based on the ansatz that the particles constitutive of the plasma are inert and only possess translational degrees of freedom . the electromagnetic field influence is accounted for . in section  [ sec : secbol ] , we express the boltzmann equation in a noninertial reference frame .",
    "we show that the mean heavy - particle velocity is a suitable choice for the referential velocity .",
    "this step is essential to establish a formalism where the electrons follow the bulk movement of the plasma .",
    "then , we define the reference quantities of the system in order to derive the scaling of the boltzmann equation from a dimensional analysis .",
    "the multiscale aspect occurs in both the streaming operator and collision operator of the boltzmann equation .",
    "consequently , section  [ sec : secpremi ] is devoted to the scaling of the partial collision operators between unlike particles .",
    "besides , we determine the space of collisional invariants associated with respectively the electrons and the heavy particles . in section  [ sec : sec4 ] , we resort to a chapman - enskog method to derive macroscopic conservation equations . the system is examined at successive orders of approximation , each of which corresponding to a physical time scale . for that purpose ,",
    "scalar products and linearized collision operators are introduced .",
    "the global expressions of the macroscopic fluid equations are then provided up to navier - stokes equations for the heavy particles and first - order drift - diffusion equations for the electrons .",
    "we also prove that our choice of referential is essential in order to reach this expansion level . in section  [ sec :",
    "sectransport ] , we establish the formal existence and uniqueness of a solution to the boltzmann equation .",
    "the multicomponent transport coefficients are then calculated in terms of bracket operators whose mathematical structure allows for the sign of the transport coefficients to be determined ; in particular , the kolesnikov effect , or the crossed contributions to the mass and energy transport fluxes coupling the electrons and heavy particles . the explicit expressions of the transport coefficients can be obtained by means of a galerkin spectral method  @xcite disregarded in the present contribution . finally in section",
    "[ sec : secentropy ] , the first and second principles of thermodynamics are proved to be satisfied by deriving a total energy equation and an entropy equation .",
    "then , we establish , from a fluid standpoint , a conservative formulation of the system of macroscopic equations .",
    "we also identify the mathematical structure of the purely convective system .",
    "hence , we demonstrate that kinetic theory shall be used as a guideline in the derivation of the macroscopic conservation equations as well as in the design of the associated numerical methods .    beyond the obvious interest of such a study from the point of view of the applications and design of numerical schemes",
    ", the present contribution also yields a formal kinetic theory of mixtures of separate masses , where the light species obey a parabolic scaling whereas the heavy species obey a hyperbolic scaling .",
    "the original treatment of the two different scalings for fluid flows was first provided by bardos @xmath1  @xcite . in their study , the purely hyperbolic scaling yields the compressible gas dynamics equations , whereas the purely parabolic scaling leads to the low mach number limit .",
    "these scalings are quite classical and both of them can be used for various asymptotics such as the vlasov - navier - stokes equations in different regimes investigated by goudon @xmath1  @xcite . yet",
    ", a rigourous derivation of a set of macroscopic equations in the situation where the hyperbolic and parabolic scalings are entangled in the same problem is an original result obtained in the present work .",
    "1 .   [ hyp1]our plasma is described by the kinetic theory of gases based on classical mechanics , provided that : a ) the mean distance between the gas particles @xmath3 is larger than the thermal de broglie wavelength , where @xmath4 is a reference number density , b ) the square of the ratio of the electron thermal speed @xmath5 to the speed of light is small .",
    "reactive collisions and particle internal energy are not accounted for .",
    "[ hyp1ter]the particle interactions are modeled as binary encounters by means of a boltzmann collision operator , provided that : a ) the gas is sufficiently dilute , @xmath0 , the mean distance between the gas particles @xmath3 is larger than the particle interaction distance @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a reference differential cross - section common to all species , b ) the plasma parameter , quantity proportional to the number of electrons in a sphere of radius equal to the debye length , is supposed to be large . hence , multiple charged particle interactions are treated as equivalent binary collisions by means of a coulomb potential screened at the debye length  @xcite .",

[ hyp3 ] the number of mach , defined as a reference hydrodynamic velocity divided by the heavy - particle thermal speed @xmath11 , is supposed to be of the order of one . 6 .",
    "[ hyp4 ] the macroscopic time scale @xmath12 is assumed to be comparable with the heavy - particle kinetic time scale @xmath13 divided by @xmath14 .",

    "it will be shown that this quantity is small , provided that assumptions  - are satisfied .",
    "therefore , a continuous description of the system is deemed to be possible .",
    "the choice of an adequate referential will prove to be essential in the following multiscale analysis .",
    "two referentials are commonly used in the literature .",
    "degond and lucquin  @xcite work in the inertial frame , as ferziger and kaper  @xcite .",
    "the second referential is presented in the following section .",

    "given the strong disparity of mass between the electrons and heavy particles , a frame linked with the heavy particles appears to be a rather natural choice for plasmas , as fully justified in the following detailed multiscale analysis .",

    "the free electrons interact with heavy particles whose global movement is frozen in space .",
