    "the energy gain during the collapse corresponds to the gravitational binding energy of the pns , @xmath6  ergs , and is emitted as neutrino radiation on time scales of tens of seconds during which the central pns cools , deleptonizes and contracts to the final neutron star .",
    "this corresponds to an emission of @xmath7 ( anti)neutrinos of all flavors with typical energies of 1015  mev .",

    "this paper addresses several issues related to the role of neutrinos on the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements in core - collapse supernova explosions .",
    "after discussing recent constraints from metal - poor stars observations on the production of heavy elements by the r - process ( section  [ sec : metal - poor - star ] ) , we describe different nuclear physics aspects that are relevant to determine the luminosities and spectra of neutrinos emitted during the pns deleptonization which proceeds via weak processes . for those involving nucleons ( section  [ sec : charg - curr - neutr ] ) , corrections due to the nuclear interaction are relevant due to the relatively high density in the decoupling region .",
    "they are particularly important for charged - current processes and are related to the symmetry energy of nuclear matter . new long term boltzmann transport simulations of the neutrino - driven wind",
    "are presented in section  [ sec : nucl - neutr - winds ] and its nucleosynthesis yield discussed .",
    "traditionally the production of elements heavier than iron has been associated with two neutron capture processes , the r - process and the s - process  @xcite with a smaller contribution due to the p - process ( or @xmath8-process )  @xcite . in this picture , the abundances of heavy elements observed in our sun are the superposition of different events producing s - process elements ( intermediate - mass agb stars and massive stars )  @xcite and r - process elements in a so far not yet identified site(s )  @xcite .",
    "the so - called solar system r - process abundance is obtained by sustracting from the solar system isotopic abundances  @xcite the solar s - process pattern determined from a combination of experimentally determined @xmath9 cross sections and agb stellar models  @xcite .",
    "due to the long evolutionary time scales of intermediate mass stars before reaching the agb phase ( up to a billion years ) , it is expected that stars that are sufficiently old will have been enriched by the r - process but not by the s - process .",

    "this reference suggested a simple `` lego - block '' model to explain these observations . in this model",
    "the production of cpr ( also known as light r - process ) elements with @xmath0 and heavy r - process elements with @xmath12 is due to two different sources : 1 ) an h - source produces the heavy r - process elements together with cpr elements and no iron with an abundance pattern as given by r - ii stars ; 2 ) an l - source produces light r - process elements or crp elements with an abundance pattern given by the observations of hd  122563  @xcite together with iron . in this model",
    "the h - source is the site where the `` main '' r - process operates while the l - source produces light r - process elements in what sometimes is denoted as `` weak '' r - process .",

    "the galaxy is chemically unmixed and eu is mainly produced in rare events with little or no iron production  @xcite .",

    "it may indicate that the relative low abundances of heavy r - process elements observed in stars that show an abundance pattern like hd  122563 are in fact produced together with light r - process elements but with much lower efficiency . if the l - source site is neutrino - driven winds from core - collapse supernova as suggested by ref .",

    "@xcite suggest that their production is robust and always results in an abundance pattern similar to the one observed in hd  122563 .",
    "if eu ( @xmath15 ) is in fact produced together with fe in l - source events a plot showing stars that have been enriched by these events should show a correlation , i.e. [ eu / fe ] should be constant as a function of metallicity .",

    "the production of nuclei with @xmath19 is due to the fission of nuclei in the region of @xmath20 and sensitive to the particular fission rates and yields used  @xcite .",
    "fission cycling is also responsible for producing a robust r - process pattern .",
    "an important aspect of r - process in neutron star mergers is that the amount of r - process material ejected is large enough ( @xmath21  m@xmath22 to @xmath23  m@xmath22 ) to produce an optical / near - infrared transient powered by the radioactive decay of r - process nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the transient luminosity is expected to reach a maximum of @xmath24  erg  s@xmath25 , i.e. kilonova luminosities , in timescales of hours to days  @xcite .",

    "these ejecta are expected to produce light r - process elements making neutron - star mergers a possible candidate to account for observations of r - ii metal - poor stars . however , due to the long evolutionary timescales involved , neutron - star mergers have problems to explain for the r - process at low metallicities  @xcite .",
    "several sites have been suggested that are expected to operate mainly at low metalicities : jets from magnetorotational supernova  @xcite and a neutrino - induced r - process in the he shell of core - collapse supernova  @xcite .",
    "these sites produce mainly nuclei with @xmath26 but an additional contribution producing light r - process elements from neutrino - driven winds from the protoneutron star or black - hole accretion disk is expected .",

    "if we consider neutrinos with energies smaller than @xmath72 , that varies between 10 and 30  mev when the density varies in the range @xmath51@xmath52  g  @xmath41 , the opacity behaves as :    @xmath73    the opacity increases by an exponential factor due to the inclusion of mean - field modifications , @xmath74 , to the vacuum q - value , @xmath75 . due to the strong sensitivity of the opacity to the neutrino energy ,",
    "the density at which neutrinos decouple increases with decreasing neutrino energy .",
    "however , @xmath74 increases with density implying that the smaller is the energy of the neutrino emitted from the protoneutron star the larger the opacity correction due to the inclusion of mean - field effects ( see figure  6 of ref .",
    "as the opacity for neutrinos mainly determines the deleptonization rate , i.e. the neutrino luminosity of the protoneutron star , we expect that the larger the @xmath74 correction , i.e. the larger the symmetry energy , the smaller the neutrino luminosity .",
    "this is in fact confirmed by boltzmann transport simulations  @xcite .    for @xmath49",
    "there is no final state blocking for the produced positron and consequently the main effect of mean - field corrections is to change the energy threshold for neutrino absorption . using a similar analysis than the above it",
    "can be shown that the opacity for antineutrinos behaves like :    @xmath76    the discussion above shows that mean - field effects increase the opacity for neutrino absorption while reducing the opacity for antineutrino absorption . when compared with simulations that do not include mean - field effects the increase of opacity for neutrinos will keep them in thermal equilibrium with matter up to larger radii .",

    "the average energy of antineutrinos is expected to increase as they decouple at slightly deeper ( hotter ) regions of the neutron star . however , due to the reduced dominance of charged - current reactions ( see figure  [ fig : opacities ] ) the change in average energy is expected to be smaller for @xmath49 .",

    "they have shown that the inclusion of mean - field effects increases the energy difference between @xmath49 and @xmath48 with respect to the values obtained without mean - field effects .",

    "this is in agreement with the correlation observed in figure  [ fig : abundevol ] as core - collapse supernova are the main contributors for fe at low metallicities  @xcite . in our calculations ,",
    "the elements sr , y , zr , nb , and mo are produced mainly in the early neutron - rich ejecta by charged - particle reactions together with some neutron captures .",
    "due to the sudden drop of alpha and neutron separation energies around @xmath1 the production of nuclei with @xmath89 decreases dramatically ( see upper panel figure  [ fig : nucleosyn ] ) .",
    "nuclei with @xmath90 ( @xmath91 ) are mainly produced in the late proton - rich ejecta by the @xmath92-process  @xcite .",
    "however their production is very inefficient due to the low antineutrino luminosities at late times .",
    "the production of elements with @xmath93 by the @xmath94-process is very sensitive to the rate of antineutrino absorption on protons  @xcite that is directly proportional to the luminosity .",
    "our value is around an order of magnitude smaller than those used in refs .",
    "@xcite but consistent with recent boltzmann transport simulations  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the amount of material ejected at later times is very small to contribute significantly to the mass - integrated abundances .",
    "if our results represent an standard situation for neutrino - driven winds , the obvious question then is : where are the elements with @xmath90 ( including ag and pd ) produced ?",
    "a recent study  @xcite has shown that the evolution with metallicity of ag and pd is uncorrelated with both @xmath1 elements ( sr , y and zr ) and heavy r - process elements ( eu and ba ) . despite of being consistent with our results , it represents a challenge for nucleosynthesis models as it is very difficult to find astrophysical conditions where ag and pd are produced without synthesizing neither @xmath1 elements nor heavy r - process elements .",
    "this also applies to electron - capture supernova that have been suggested as a possible site for the production of elements between ge and zr  @xcite .",
    "another open problem that can not be explained by our simulations is the correlation between eu and fe observed in figure  [ fig : abundevol ] .    due to the relatively large values of @xmath30 achieved in our nucleosynthesis calculations",
    ", only the neutron - deficient isotopes of elements between ge and mo are produced .",
    "this can be tested by observations of isotopic abundances in metal - poor stars . at the same time it requires that the neutron - rich isotopes , that normally can not be produced by the s - process  @xcite , are produced in some other astrophysical site . due to the more neutron - rich conditions achieved in electron - capture supernova",
    "@xcite it is expected that their distribution will be richer in neutron - rich isotopes .",
    "an alternative site ( but probably more speculative ) is core - collapse supernova explosions due to a quark - hadron phase transition  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to notice that @xmath4mo , a nucleus that is difficult to produce by the p - process  @xcite , is abundantly produced in our calculations .",
    "we have analyzed recent evidence of metal - poor stars that show the existence of two distinctive sources for the production of r - process nuclei with different frequencies along galactic history  @xcite .",
    "there is strong evidence that core - collapse supernova could be the site for the production of light r - process elements including sr , y and zr ( sometimes also denoted as lepp elements )  @xcite .",
    "they will account for the abundances of elements observed in metal - poor stars that are enriched in light r - process elements but depleted in heavy r - process elements .",
    "hd  122563  @xcite constitutes the classical example .",
    "looking at the evolution with metallicity of several light r - process elements and eu , that is taken as a representative of heavy r - process elements , in hd  122563 type stars we find a strong correlation .",
    "it indicates that in fact the abundances of sr , y and zr seen in these stars are due to core - collapse supernova that is the major producer of iron at low metallicity .",
    "the situation for ag is unclear as only two of the stars that survive our selection criteria have observed abundances of ag .",
    "a recent study has in fact shown that the abundance of ag is anticorrelated with sr , y and zr  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , we also find that the eu abundance observed on hd  122563 type stars is correlated with fe .",
    "it will be interesting to see if this correlation extends to other elements like ba .",
    "we have presented first long - term boltzmann transport neutrino - wind simulations based on a core - collapse supernova equation of state that reproduces recent constrains on the nuclear symmetry energy at saturation densities  @xcite and on the energy per nucleon of neutron matter  @xcite .",
    "our simulations consistently include mean - field corrections for neutrons and protons  @xcite for the ( anti)neutrino opacities at high density .",
    "these corrections increase sustantially the opacity for @xmath48 .",
    "the increase being largest the larger the mean - field energy difference between neutrons and protons , i.e. the larger the symmetry energy of the eos .",
    "a larger symmetry energy implies a larger difference between the average energies of the emitted @xmath49 and @xmath48  @xcite and a smaller neutrino luminosity  @xcite .",
    "both aspects are important for determining the nucleosynthesis in neutrino - driven winds .",
    "our simulations predict that the early neutrino - driven wind ejecta is neutron - rich with @xmath95 . at times around 4",
    "s the ejecta become proton - rich reaching @xmath3 at 9  s when our simulation stops .",
    "we have analyzed the nucleosynthesis outcome of the simulations .",
    "our results show that neutrino - driven winds do not produce heavy r - process elements .",
    "they contribute to the production of elements between zn and mo , including @xmath4mo that is largely underproduced by the p - process in massive stars  @xcite .",
    "the elemental abundances are consistent with the observations of the metal - poor star hd  12263 . for elements between ge and mo",
    ", we produce mainly the neutron - deficient isotopes .",
    "this prediction could be confirmed by observations of isotopic abundances in metal - poor stars .",
    "no elements heavier than mo ( @xmath5 ) are produced in our calculations . in neutron - rich ejecta",
    ", their production is suppressed due to the @xmath1 shell closure . in the late proton - rich ejecta ,",
    "the @xmath94-process , that in principle can contribute to their production , is very inefficient due to the low antineutrino luminosities .",
    "even if our nucleosynthesis study is based on parameter free boltzmann transport simulations , there are still some sources of uncertainty on the determination of the ( anti)neutrino opacities .",
    "one is the treatment of neutrino interactions with light nuclear clusters , in particular @xmath96h , @xmath83h .",
    "they are expected to be present in the region of neutrino decoupling  @xcite and in fact the equation of state we use predicts them with large abundances ( see figure 10 of ref .",
    "the presence of light nuclear clusters affects the ( anti)neutrino opacities in different ways .",
    "first , it modifies the mean - field corrections for the unbound nucleons  @xcite .",
    "this effect is included in our simulations .",
    "secondly , it becomes necessary to consider both charged and neutral current interactions with the light clusters .",
    "the relevant cross sections have been computed for the deuteron  @xcite and triton  @xcite in vacuum .",
    "however , their presence in the nuclear medium will induce changes in the energy thresholds for the reactions due to different in medium modifications for the for the initial and final states .",
    "furthermore , the wave functions  @xcite for the cluster will be modified with respect to the vacuum case affecting the response to ( anti)neutrinos .",
    "an accurate determination of the ( anti)neutrino spectra and luminosities and their evolution with time is also necessary for neutrino flavor oscillations in supernova  @xcite and neutrino detection on earth . from the point of view of nucleosynthesis in neutrino - driven winds collective neutrino oscillations  @xcite are most relevant .",
    "it remains to evaluate the impact that they may have on the nucleosynthesis .",
    "another important effect is the possibility of oscillations of active to sterile neutrinos , suggested to explain the reactor anomaly  @xcite .",
    "oscillations to the sterile flavor can affect both the dynamics during the supernova explosion  @xcite and the neutrino - driven wind nucleosynthesis  @xcite .",
