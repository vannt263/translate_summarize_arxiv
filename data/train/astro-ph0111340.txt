    "centaurus a ( ngc 5128 ) is the nearest ( d=3.4 mpc ) active galaxy to the milky way and has been well studied across the entire electromagnetic spectrum @xcite . its proximity allows the features of an active galaxy to be studied at the highest linear spatial resolution ( @xmath117 pc at the distance of cen a ) .",
    "optically cen a appears to be an elliptical galaxy crossed by a dark dust lane through the center , which is thought to be the result of a merger with a small spiral galaxy @xcite .",
    "previous radio observations of centaurus a have detected a bright radio core , a superluminal nuclear jet @xcite , a one - sided , kiloparsec scale jet extending @xmath2 ne of the nucleus @xcite , two radio lobes ne and sw of the nucleus , and extended , low surface brightness diffuse emission spanning several degrees on the sky .",
    "it is often considered to be the proto - typical fanaroff - riley class i low - luminosity radio galaxy .    prior to the launch of _ chandra _",
    ", x - ray emission had been detected from the knots in the jets , or hotspots in the lobes , of seven radio galaxies @xcite , but we are far from a detailed understanding of the mechanisms responsible for this emission .",
    "this has partly been due to the limited angular resolution of x - ray observatories preventing a detailed comparison of jet features across a wide sample of galaxies .",
    "this has changed with the launch of the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations of fr i radio galaxies have shown that jet x - ray emission may be a common feature of all such galaxies @xcite , implying that the production of x - ray emission may be fundamental to the nature of such jets .",
    "cen a is one of two fr i galaxies in which an x - ray jet had been detected prior to _ chandra _ ( m87 being the other ) , and , as the closest such galaxy , provides an opportunity to study jet physics at the highest linear resolution .",
    "previous x - ray observations of cen a have detected x - ray emission along much of the length of the jet , and bright enhancements at the locations of the radio knots of the inner jet @xcite .",
    "based largely on the similarities of the x - ray and radio morphologies , it has been argued that a single population of ultra - relativistic electrons is responsible for the emission in both the radio and x - ray regimes @xcite .",
    "recent _ chandra _ hrc observations of cen a suggested small but significant differences in the spatial morphology of the jet in the x - ray and radio bandpasses @xcite .",
    "no optical or infrared emission from the jet at the positions of the bright x - ray knots of the inner jet has been seen .",
    "the upper limits placed by hst wfpc2 and nicmos observations , however , are well above an extrapolation of the radio to x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "the inner 1 kpc of the jet passes through the dust lane of the galaxy , making detection of any optical component difficult .",
    "several optical filaments have been detected in the vicinity of the jet and ne radio lobe , but their relationship to the x - ray / radio jet , if any , is unclear @xcite .",
    "infrared ( 1.25 @xmath3 m ) emission extending @xmath4 from the nucleus along the position angle of the jet has been detected , but it was argued that while this emission is probably related to the jet , it is not due to synchrotron radiation from relativistic particles @xcite",
    ".    in this paper , we present preliminary results from the analysis of two @xmath036 ks _ chandra _ acis - i observations of the jet in cen a. the unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity of _ chandra _ have allowed us to resolve many features of the jet not previously seen .",
    "we present spectra of the brightest knots and diffuse emission in the jet , and make a detailed comparison of the jet s x - ray and radio morphology .",
    "the goal of this paper is to present images , spectra , and preliminary results from these observations . a more detailed interpretation and discussion of these results",
    "will be presented in a future publication .",
    "analysis of other aspects of these observations , including the x - ray point source population , emission from the hot interstellar medium , and emission from the radio lobes also will be presented in separate publications @xcite .",
    "we assume a distance of 3.4 mpc to cen a throughout this paper .",
    "the _ chandra _ telescope has an imaging resolution of better than @xmath5 on - axis .",
    "the 50% encircled energy diameter has been measured to be @xmath6 @xcite , and sources separated by @xmath7 on - axis have been resolved @xcite .",
    "the imaging degrades significantly for sources more than @xmath8 off - axis . at @xmath9 from the center of the field of view , 90% of the encircled energy",
    "is contained within a diameter of @xmath10 .",
    "the sensitivity of the acis - i instrument extends from 0.4 kev to 10 kev . a more detailed discussion of the capabilities of the _ chandra_/acis - i instrument",
    "is contained elsewhere @xcite . the pointing and sim position for each observation",
    "were chosen so that the central region of the galaxy , including the nucleus , the jet , the sw radio lobe , and most of the point sources and diffuse emission from the hot ism were located within one ccd ( the i3 chip ) .",
    "the raw events were filtered to include only asca grades 0,2,3,4 , and 6 .",
    "all events below 0.4 kev and above 5 kev were removed .",
    "the response of the acis - i drops rapidly below 0.4 kev , so that most of the events below this are either background or higher energy events in the tail of the energy redistribution function . above 5 kev , most of the events are either particle background events or events in the psf wings from the bright nucleus . all events at node boundaries were removed because of uncertainties in grade reconstruction .",
    "all events with pulse height invariant channel ( pi ) equal to 0 , 1 , or 1024 were removed as they represent unphysical signals ; hot ccd columns and pixels were removed using the standard table provided by the chandra x - ray center ( cxc ) .",
    "short term transients due to cosmic rays which produced events in three or more consecutive frames that could mimic a point source ( van speybroeck 2000 , private communication ) also were removed .",
    "cen a was observed twice , on december 5 , 1999 and may 17 , 2000 , with the acis - i instrument .",
    "the exposure times for the two observations ( obsids 00316 and 00962 ) were 35856 s and 36510 s. the data were examined for periods of high background or problems with the aspect solution , but none were found .",
    "the aspect solution for _ chandra _ observations is generally good to @xmath11 or better @xcite , but we have independently verified the aspect solution of both data sets by comparing the positions of x - ray point sources at the edge of the field of view with stellar positions tabulated in the usno a2.0 catalog @xcite , and estimate that our absolute astrometry is accurate to within @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the fov for each of the observations and the position of best focus is shown in figure  [ fov ] superimposed on an optical dss image .    the raw , co - added x - ray image in the 0.4 - 5 kev bandpass binned at @xmath11 per pixel is shown in figure  [ xraw ] .",
    "the nucleus is clearly visible , along with the x - ray jet extending to the ne , many point sources , emission from the hot ism , and emission coincident with the sw radio lobe .",
    "this image has not been exposure corrected .",
    "the radial stripes pointing from the nucleus are the result of removing the frame transfer streak caused by out of time events .",
    "the other linear features around the image are gaps between the various ccds in one or the other of the exposures .",
    "an adaptively smoothed , co - added , exposure - corrected x - ray image of cen a in the 1 - 3 kev band is shown in figure  [ cena ] .",
    "we also use radio observations of cen a made at 8.4 ghz between october 1990 and november 1991 with the nrao very large array ( vla ) , consisting of approximately two hours on - source integration time in each of the a , b , c and dnc arrays .",
    "the data were reduced in the standard manner using aips and then combined ( after correcting for variations in the flux density of the core ) to produce a single @xmath13 dataset , sensitive to structure with a largest scale of @xmath14 and with a maximal resolution of @xmath15 .",
    "the radio maps presented in this paper are all made from this full dataset with appropriate tapering and weighting of the @xmath13 plane .",
    "the nominal dynamic range of the maps ( peak to off - source r.m.s .",
    "noise ) is about 10@xmath16 , but their fidelity is limited by residual phase and amplitude artifacts about the 7 jy core .",
    "we compared the position of the radio core in this data set with its position in archival australia telescope compact array ( atca ) observations at a similar frequency , and found that there was a small ( @xmath17 ) offset between the two data sets .",
    "we attribute this difference to the use of a distant ( @xmath18 degree ) phase calibrator in the vla observations , together with the heavy use of self - calibration in the data reduction ; the atca observations , which use a nearby phase calibrator and were only lightly self - calibrated , are likely to have better positional accuracy .",
    "we have therefore shifted the vla data so that the core position agrees with that determined from the atca data .",
    "after this adjustment , we find that the x - ray and radio positions of the nuclei and the first bright x - ray / radio knot ax1/a1 agree to within the absolute aspect uncertainty of @xmath19 of the x - ray data .",
    "an adaptively smoothed , coadded , exposure corrected image of the cen a jet in the 0.4 to 2.5 kev bandpass is shown in figure  [ jetbw ] .",
    "the nucleus is located in the sw corner of the image , and the jet extends to the ne .",
    "the count rate from the active nucleus in the _ chandra _ bandpass is large ( @xmath06 cts s@xmath20 ) and the unusual shape of the nucleus in this image is an artifact of pile - up in the acis - i detector .",
    "pile - up occurs when more than one event is incident on the detector in the same or adjacent pixels in less than the frame time . for moderate count rates ( 0.01 to 0.1 cts / s )",
    ", this distorts the observed pulse height spectrum , as there is no way to determine if a pixel contains multiple events . at high count rates , like that for the cen a nucleus , the event morphologies",
    "tend to migrate to grades that are not telemetered to the ground and these are lost .",
    "the figure shows that diffuse emission from the jet is observed continuously from the nucleus to the end of the x - ray jet @xmath21 from the nucleus .",
    "a slightly different view from the nucleus to knot b is shown in figure  [ gsjet ] , where the data in the 0.5 to 1.5 kev bandpass have been smoothed with a gaussian ( @xmath22=@xmath23 ) .",
    "our _ chandra _ observations show that the x - ray jet consists of many knots of enhanced emission embedded within diffuse emission .",
    "the diffuse emission extends continuously from the nuclear jet ( knot nx1 ) into the ne radio lobe beyond knot g. each of the previously detected x - ray knots has considerable substructure when viewed at higher resolution . using a wavelet decomposition source - detection algorithm to detect emission enhancements on angular scales of @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xcite",
    ", we find a total of 31 distinct knots or enhancements of x - ray emission embedded within the diffuse emission .",
    "previous _ einstein _",
    "observations @xcite detected 7 distinct x - ray knots ( labeled a to g ) , but subsequent rosat observations @xcite were unable to confirm knot d. radio observations @xcite showed that the inner knot ( a ) is actually composed of four subknots ( a1 through a4 ) .",
    "we refer to the inner @xmath26 of the jet , which includes these compact radio knots , as the inner jet .",
    "figure  [ diffuse ] contains a contour map of the unresolved , diffuse emission from the jet with the contribution from the knots removed overplotted onto the adaptively smoothed image of the jet ( figure  [ jetbw ] ) .",
    "this contour map was created using a wavelet decomposition and retaining only emission on scales of @xmath27 and larger .",
    "as described in detail below , many of the radio and x - ray knots of the inner jet region do not exactly coincide , and all of the previously reported knots beyond the inner jet are actually composed of several smaller subknots . to avoid confusion",
    ", we will refer to the x - ray knots of the inner jet as ax1 , ax2 , etc . , and knots beyond the inner jet as bx1 , bx2 , cx1 , cx2 , etc . ,",
    "depending on their location relative to the knots of @xcite to clearly distinguish them from the radio knots .",
    "the nomenclature of @xcite will be used when referring specifically to the radio knots .",
    "a summary of previously known radio and x - ray knots and their distances from the nucleus is contained in table  [ rxknots ] . when discussing x - ray jets , it is common to use the term _ knot _ to specifically describe the sites of enhanced emission where shocks may be accelerating the emitting particles .",
    "we have detected 31 sites of enhanced emission , but it is certainly not clear that they are all sites of shocks and particle acceleration , particularly the enhancements beyond knot b. for simplicity , however , we will use the term _ knot _ throughout this paper to describe these enhancements .    in the inner jet region , x - ray emission from the nuclear jet ( radio knot n1 ) is clearly detected within @xmath28 of the nucleus , and detectable x - ray emission is clearly present between the nuclear jet and the first bright radio / x - ray knot a1/ax1 as seen from figure  [ gsjet ] .",
    "the position of the first bright x - ray knot ax1 coincides ( within our absolute uncertainty in astrometry @xmath19 ) with radio knot a1 ( see below ) .",
    "knot ax1 is clearly extended both along the jet and perpendicular to it . for reference ,",
    "the psf of the observation at the position of the nucleus ( fwhm ) is shown on the righthand side of figure  [ gsjet ] .",
    "there is continuous diffuse emission and several x - ray knots between radio knots a1 and b , and there is a kink or bend in the jet direction between knots ax2 and ax3 .",
    "an image of the x - ray contours in the 0.4 - 1.5 kev bandpass overlaid onto an optical ( hst ) image of cen a is shown in figure  [ optovl ] .",
    "the region of low x - ray surface brightness between knots ax5 and ax6 corresponds with dark dust bands in the optical .",
    "the jet appears to widen dramatically before knot b just as it emerges from behind the dust lane , although it appears to remain collimated . beyond knot b ,",
    "the jet is composed of both knots and diffuse emission .",
    "the width of the jet is approximately constant out to knot e ( @xmath29 from the nucleus ) , where the jet apparently begins to narrow ( see figure  [ cena ] ) , although whether this is a real feature or just due to a decrease in the x - ray surface brightness is not clear .",
    "variable absorption in the inner jet region might have an effect on the observed x - ray structure .",
    "the optical extinction , @xmath30 , in the inner jet region varies between 0.5 and 3.0 magnitudes @xcite . adopting a standard galactic gas - to - dust ratio",
    ", this corresponds to an x - ray column of 0.9 - 5.6@xmath3110@xmath32@xmath33 @xcite . for a power - law spectrum with photon index = 2.2 , this variation in @xmath34 would correspond to a variation of a factor of @xmath02 in count rate in acis - i in the 0.4 - 2.5 kev bandpass of the acis - i , although in the region from the core to ax4 ( before the dark dust lanes are encountered ) the positional variations in x - ray count rate contributed by the absorption are expected to be less than 10% .",
    "the actual relationship between the x - ray emission from the jet and any intervening absorbing material is probably more complex for two reasons .",
    "first , the angle of the jet to the line of sight is poorly constrained , so the geometric relationship of the jet relative to the gas associated with the optically obscuring dust is by no means clear .",
    "second , the x - ray spectral fitting ( described below ) suggests that the absorbing column of the brightest knots of the inner jet ( ax1-ax4 ) is considerably larger ( @xmath356@xmath3110@xmath32@xmath33 ) than one would expect based on the extinction map of @xcite .",
    "in fact , this x - ray column density is at the high end of the range inferred from @xmath30 over most or all of the inner jet .",
    "we note that the morphological features of the inner jet seen in the broad - band x - ray image are still present when x - rays in the 1 - 3 kev band only are selected , so the appearance of the inner jet is probably not significantly distorted because of variable absorption .",
    "to determine which of these knots are extended and which are pointlike and may therefore be xrbs unrelated to the jet , we have simulated point sources at five positions separated by @xmath8 along the jet starting at the nucleus using marx .",
    "we only used data from the first ( obsid 00316 ) observation as the jet is closer to the best focus , and coadding the second data set at a different roll angle would add considerable systematic uncertainty .",
    "the ratio of the number of counts within a @xmath5 radius circle to the number of counts within a @xmath5 to @xmath11 annular ring was determined for each of these simulated point sources .",
    "a third - order polynomial was fit to this ratio as a function of distance from the nucleus in order to estimate this ratio at an arbitrary position along the jet .",
    "the measured ratio for each of the detected enhancements was then compared to the simulated ratio .",
    "if the measured ratio is less than 3@xmath22 below the simulated ratio , the enhancement is considered a point source . on the basis of this test , we find that three of the enhancements are consistent with point sources ( see table  [ knottab ] ) .",
    "the normalized surface brightness profiles of the two brightest knots , ax1 and bx2 , and the marx simulations of the psfs at the locations of those knots is plotted in figure  [ sbp ] .",
    "we have evaluated this procedure by testing other sources located near the jet , but clearly outside the diffuse emission , and find that four of the five sources are consistent with being point sources .",
    "the fifth source is obviously distorted and by visual inspection alone it is clear that it should not be considered a point source .",
    "the position , background - subtracted count rate , and luminosity of each knot are given in table  [ knottab ] .",
    "based on the radial surface - density distribution of x - ray point sources in cen a @xcite , we expect three of the knots or sources to be x - ray binaries within cen a , but unrelated to the jet .",
    "we conclude that the remaining knots are features of the jet structure that are resolved by _",
    "the x - ray morphology of the jet is clearly more complex when observed at higher resolution .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that there may be even more complex structure at smaller spatial scales that can only be resolved at higher resolution . to estimate",
    "what fraction of the remaining unresolved emission of the jet could be due to a large number of unresolved , lower luminosity knots , we created the luminosity function ( lf ) for the jet knots shown in figure  [ klfunc ] .",
    "the luminosity of the knots is taken from table  [ knottab ] .",
    "we assume a power - law spectrum with photon index 2.3 and @xmath34=1.7@xmath3110@xmath32 @xmath36 .",
    "the knots of the inner jet ( nx1 and ax1 - 6 ) were excluded because the variable absorption makes determination of the unabsorbed luminosity more uncertain .",
    "the knots we identified as point sources ( cx1 and ex1 ) have also been excluded .",
    "the limiting sensitivity for this analysis is somewhat uncertain because of source confusion and depends on the distribution of luminosity and spatial extent among the knots .",
    "a detailed computation of the limiting sensitivity for detection of knots in the jet would require a monte carlo simulation and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we note that the limiting sensitivity away from the jet region for which point source detection is complete and unbiased is @xmath03@xmath3110@xmath37 ergs s@xmath20 @xcite . source confusion and source extent will increase this value , but this increase is offset somewhat because we coadded the two observations for this analysis .",
    "for simplicity , we choose the limiting luminosity for knot detection , @xmath38=3@xmath3110@xmath37 ergs s@xmath20 , the same as for point source detection .",
    "this is approximately the luminosity at which the lf begins to flatten ( see figure  [ klfunc ] )",
    ". the results below are not sensitive to this choice .",
    "we fit a power - law to the knot lf for knots with @xmath393@xmath3110@xmath37 ergs s@xmath20 to quantify the distribution of knot luminosities .",
    "we parameterize the lf as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the normalization at @xmath42=10@xmath43 ergs s@xmath20 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are @xmath44=1.1 and @xmath41=0.28 .",
    "if this distribution is extended to some minimum luminosity , @xmath45 , the integrated x - ray flux from the jet ( using the best - fit parameters ) between @xmath45 and @xmath46 ( the luminosity of the brightest detected knot ) is given by @xmath47 the total luminosity of the jet in a region @xmath48 long and @xmath49 wide beginning at a distance of @xmath26 from the nucleus containing all the knots in the lf is 3.59@xmath3110@xmath43 ergs s@xmath20 .",
    "the integrated luminosity of the detected knots in this region is 1.23@xmath3110@xmath43 ergs s@xmath20 .",
    "the remainder of the emission of the jet can be entirely accounted for if @xmath45=3@xmath3110@xmath50 ergs s@xmath20 , assuming there is no break in the index of the lf below @xmath38 .",
    "the total number of knots at this minimum luminosity , @xmath51 , is @xmath01700 .",
    "based on this simple analysis , it is possible that the unresolved diffuse emission of the jet actually consists of many lower luminosity , and perhaps smaller scale , knots .",
    "each of the detected knots may , in fact , actually consist of several unresolved lower luminosity knots .",
    "figure  [ jetrad1 ] contains an adaptively - smoothed x - ray image of the jet with 3.6 cm radio contours overlaid .",
    "the inner jet region , from the nucleus to just beyond knot b , is shown in figure  [ jetrad2 ] with the 3.6 cm radio contours overlaid .",
    "the resolution of radio data is @xmath52(ra)@xmath53(dec ) ( fwhm ) in figure  [ jetrad1 ] and @xmath54(ra)@xmath55(dec ) ( fwhm ) in figure  [ jetrad2 ] .",
    "the approximate positions of the x - ray and radio knots are labeled in figure  [ jetrad2 ] above and below the jet , respectively . within the @xmath19 absolute positional resolution of the x - ray image",
    ", the position of radio knot a1 agrees with that of the first bright x - ray knot ax1 .",
    "we detect weak x - ray emission between the nuclear jet ( nx1 ) and this first bright x - ray knot coincident with previously observed radio emission @xcite .",
    "further along the jet , however , there is a noticeable difference between the peaks in the x - ray emission and the radio emission . at knot",
    "b , the peak of the x - ray emission is @xmath56 ( @xmath080 pc ) closer to the nucleus than the peak of the radio emission .",
    "the ratio of x - ray to radio flux for knots ax1/a1 and bx2/b is considerably higher than for the rest of the jet .",
    "such an anomalous brightness at one or two knots in the jets of several other fr i radio galaxies has recently been reported @xcite , and may be a fundamental characteristic of such jets .",
    "although morphological differences between the x - ray and radio emission are significant both along the jet and perpendicular to it , these can be seen more clearly by viewing the jet in projection .",
    "figure  [ profile ] shows the intensity profile of the jet in a projection @xmath57 wide along position angle 55@xmath58 in both the x - ray ( 0.4 - 1.8 kev to suppress the mirror - scattered nuclear contribution ) and radio ( 3.6 cm ) .",
    "this projection extends @xmath59 from the nucleus along the jet to a region just beyond knot b. no background has been subtracted from the x - ray data but , as can be seen from the gaps between the knots , the background is small in this projection .",
    "the radio positions of the knots ( a1 - 4 and b ) @xcite of the inner jet have been labeled .",
    "differences and offsets between the x - ray and radio emission of the jet are apparent .",
    "there is a small difference between the radio and x - ray peaks at knot a1/ax1 , but this difference is consistent with our @xmath19 uncertainty on the absolute alignment of the x - ray data and centroiding the position of the x - ray nucleus because of the pile - up . beyond knot a1 , however , the morphological differences are significant .",
    "the second ( ax2 ) and third ( ax3 ) x - ray knots of the inner jet lie approximately @xmath60 ( @xmath0 40 pc ) closer to the nucleus than the second ( a2 ) and third ( a3 ) radio knots , whereas the fourth knot ( ax4 ) lies approximately @xmath56 farther from the nucleus than the fourth ( a4 ) radio knot .",
    "knot ax6 ( knot ax in @xcite ) coincides with a small peak in the radio emission .",
    "the region between the fourth radio knot ( a4 ) of the inner jet and radio knot b is crossed by several dark optical bands ( see figure  [ optovl ] ) .",
    "the radio position of the nuclear jet is several arcseconds from the nucleus @xcite and is labeled ( n1 ) .",
    "we detect a significant x - ray enhancement at the position of this nuclear jet ( labeled nx1 ) , and continuous emission from this knot to x - ray / radio knot a1 . the x - ray emission from knot b",
    "is composed of emission from one bright knot , which lies @xmath61 closer to the nucleus than the radio peak , and five fainter knots surrounded by diffuse emission .",
    "these high resolution _",
    "observations permit us to measure the transverse width of the x - ray jet as a function of distance from the nucleus .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ jetbw ] , the jet progressively widens along its length , and several bends or turns are visible in the inner jet region between the nucleus and knot b. in the inner jet region , the width of the jet is only marginally resolved in our data .",
    "as described above , we used marx simulations @xcite to model the psf of the observation at 1.5 kev for the location of the inner jet in the first observation ( obsid 00316 ) .",
    "we used only one observation for this analysis to avoid uncertainties that would be introduced by combining the psfs of two observations at different roll angles and off axis positions . in the inner jet region , we estimated the width of the jet perpendicular to the direction of propagation according to @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the width of the knot ( fwhm ) , @xmath64 is the observed width ( fwhm ) of the knot , and @xmath65 is the width of the psf ( fwhm ) . beyond the inner jet , the transverse width of the jet is clearly resolved and can be measured directly .    the width of the x - ray jet as a function of distance from the nucleus is plotted in figure  [ width ] . for comparison , the fwhm of the individual features in the jet taken from earlier radio measurements ( taken from figure 4 and table 2 of @xcite ) at two angular resolutions are also plotted .",
    "the width measured from our more sensitive 3.6 cm radio data shown in figure  [ jetrad1 ] is plotted as the continuous curve . we note that these are two somewhat different definitions of width .",
    "@xcite define the radio width of the jet as the second moment of the brightness distribution .",
    "we have chosen the surface - brightness boundary of the jet as the definition of width for the 3.6 cm data shown as the continuous curve in figure  [ jetrad1 ] .",
    "this difference permits a more straightforward comparison with our x - ray data as we have chosen two similar definitions of the width for our x - ray analysis .",
    "it is appropriate to compare the radio widths of @xcite with our measurements of the x - ray widths in the inner jet region , and the 3.6 cm radio widths with the x - ray widths beyond the inner jet region .",
    "as can be seen from figure  [ jetrad1 ] , the x - ray width of the jet at knot ax1 is marginally smaller than the radio width . beyond knot ax1",
    ", however , the x - ray jet is definitively narrower than the radio jet .",
    "it is not clear whether this is a real feature or an instrumental artifact related to the low x - ray surface brightness at the edge of the jet as it becomes undetectable above the emission from the hot ism .",
    "if this difference in widht is a real feature of the jet , it implies that the higher energy , x - ray emitting plasma is confined in a narrower channel than the radio emitting plasma .",
    "we also made projections of the data along a position angle of 55 degrees in two different energy bands , 0.4 - 1.5 kev and 1.5 - 5.0 kev to investigate whether there are differences in the width of the jet in the two x - ray bands which would support the idea that the most energetic particles are constrained within a smaller channel of the jet .",
    "four regions of the jet were projected ; the inner jet between , but not including , knot ax1 and knot b , knot b , and two regions beyond knot b. the regions are summarized in table  [ projregs ] .",
    "figure  [ proj1 ] contains the first two of these projections ; the other two are similar .",
    "the data from the two observations have been co - added but not exposure corrected .",
    "we find no statistically significant difference in the width of the jet in the two bands at any position along the jet implying that the particles responsible for the emission in the two bands are homogeneously mixed .",
    "this result also suggests that variable absorption is not significant in modifying the transverse morphology of the jet .",
    "two knots of radio emission in the sw radio lobe @xcite could be related to a counterjet .",
    "similarly , several pointlike sources of x - ray emission have been detected in both the hrc image @xcite and the acis observations presented here .",
    "there are five bright x - ray points that are approximately colinear with the nucleus and the forward jet , suggestive of a counterjet .",
    "several of these points are near ( @xmath66 ) , but not coincident with the radio knots .",
    "the two radio knots are not colinear with the nucleus and forward jet .",
    "x - ray spectra of these unresolved sources are not significantly different from that of the population of x - ray binaries @xcite .",
    "it is possible that the emission from these unresolved x - ray sources may be related to a non - thermal process originating in a collimated outflow from the nucleus , but without additional evidence , we conclude that these sources are xrbs within cen a unrelated to a counterjet .",
    "we derived spectral parameters for four regions of the jet .",
    "these regions are knot a1 , knot b , the knots between a1 and b , and all of the emission beyond knot b to the edge of the x - ray jet .",
    "it was not possible simply to combine the data from the two observations for spectral analysis for two reasons .",
    "first , the focal plane temperature at the time of the first observation was -110@xmath67c , but it had been changed to -120@xmath67c by the time of the second .",
    "second , even though the entire jet was placed on one chip for both observations , the jet spans different parts of the chips for each . given the variation in spectral response across output nodes and across a chip due to radiation damage , it was necessary to generate response matrices for each observation and fit data from both observations simultaneously . for the last two regions , a response matrix appropriate for the center of the given region was used .",
    "none of the regions crosses output node boundaries .",
    "we have fit absorbed power - law , raymond - smith with variable abundance , and thermal - bremsstrahlung models to the spectra in the 0.4 to 4.5 kev band .",
    "all three models produce acceptable fits , and there is no statistical reason to choose one over the other . the best - fit temperatures of the raymond - smith and thermal - bremsstrahlung models range between 3 and 5 kev with large uncertainty , the abundance in the raymond - smith fits is low ( @xmath00.1 solar but statistically consistent with zero ) and poorly constrained .",
    "such a high - temperature , low - abundance plasma has no spectral features or emission lines than can be resolved at the resolution of the acis - i instrument and is indistinguishable from the absorbed power - law model when fit over a restricted energy band .",
    "although our data do not rule out a thermal model , we reject them on physical grounds as described below and consider only the absorbed power - law model further .",
    "the spectra and best - fit power - law for knots a1 and b are shown in figure  [ knotspect ] , and the parameters of all of the fits of the absorbed power - law model are summarized in table  [ sfit ] . note that in all cases the best - fit absorbing column is larger than the galactic value of 7@xmath3110@xmath68 @xmath33 @xcite , implying considerable absorption within cen a. this is not surprising for the inner jet region where the jet crosses the dust lane .",
    "as described above , the best - fit column density for the two inner jet regions is at the high end of the range suggested by @xmath30 .",
    "significant amounts of neutral hydrogen ( @xmath35 few@xmath31 10@xmath68 @xmath33 ) have been detected in the vicinity of the jet beyond knot b out to knot f @xcite , implying that perhaps the jet is behind much of this absorbing material .",
    "the best - fit index for the emission beyond knot b is similar to that of the brighter knots of the inner jet .",
    "the flux from this region of the jet is dominated ( @xmath075% ) by the diffuse , unresolved component .",
    "this spectral similarity between the knots of the inner jet and the diffuse component further from the nucleus implies that the emission mechanisms are similar , and supports the hypothesis , suggested in the lf analysis above , that the the unresolved , diffuse emission is composed of many lower - luminosity , spatially unresolved knots .",
    "we have determined the radio to x - ray spectral index for each of the bright radio and x - ray knots in the inner jet . even though the x - ray and radio peaks are misaligned",
    ", there is detectable x - ray emission between the radio knots and vice versa .",
    "we measured the x - ray count rate and radio flux density at 8.4 ghz in @xmath25 wide boxes centered on each of seven x - ray and three radio peaks of the inner jet and in the vicinity of radio knot b. the x - ray count rates were converted to flux densities at 1 kev assuming a photon index of 2.2 . for the x - ray knots ( excluding knot ax1 ) , we find that the spectral indices between the x - ray and radio bands vary between 0.80 and 0.97 ( average 0.90 ) , and for the radio knots ( again excluding ax1 ) between 0.99 and 1.01 .",
    "the flux densities and spectral indices are summarized in table  [ fdens ] .",
    "even though there are significant ( factor of three ) variations in the ratio of x - ray to radio flux along the jet ( figure  [ profile ] ) , the differences in the spectral index between the x - ray peaks and radio peaks are only @xmath00.1 - 0.15 .",
    "all of these indices are considerably steeper than the radio spectral indices ( 20 cm to 6 cm ) previously reported @xcite , implying spectral steepening between the radio and the x - ray .",
    "we note that these radio to x - ray indices are remarkably similar to those measured for the jet in the fr i galaxy 3c 66b @xcite , but considerably steeper than that of 3c 273 @xcite .",
    "to summarize , we find that the x - ray morphology of the jet consists of an unresolved , `` diffuse '' component that extends from within at least @xmath050 pc ( @xmath28 ) of the nucleus to @xmath04 kpc , and contains at least 31 distinct , spatially - resolved x - ray enhancements embedded within diffuse emission .",
    "the width of the diffuse component of the inner jet is roughly constant to knot ax6 , where it widens , although there appears to be a bend or twist in the jet between knots ax2 and ax3 in this inner jet region . in the vicinity of knot b , the jet widens again . beyond knot",
    "f the jet appears to narrow , but this may be due to a decrease in the surface brightness of the diffuse component .",
    "there are significant differences between the x - ray and radio morphologies in the inner jet region .",
    "the spectra of the knots and diffuse emission of the jet are well fit by both absorbed power - law and absorbed thermal models , but there is no direct evidence for any emission lines in the spectra .",
    "what do these results tell us about the nature of the x - ray emission ?",
    "generally , four models are typically invoked to explain x - ray emission from extragalactic jets and the hotspots in radio lobes : thermal emission , synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) emission , inverse - compton scattering from an external source of seed photons , and synchrotron emission from a population of ultra - relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "the first three have been rejected by previous authors @xcite for the cen a jet , and this work does not alter those conclusions .",
    "the thermal model was ruled out because of the relatively high density of thermal plasma required to explain the emission .",
    "this plasma would be overpressured relative to the surrounding medium , and it would therefore be difficult to confine this plasma within a small volume .",
    "the knots would rapidly dissipate .",
    "in addition , faraday rotation and depolarization measurements put upper limits on the density of material in such thermal knots that are well below that required to account for the observed emission .",
    "the absence of any significant spectral features observed in our data strengthens this conclusion .",
    "we note that recent _",
    "chandra_/hetg observations of the jet of m87 also failed to detect line emission @xcite .",
    "inverse - compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background has been successful in explaining the x - ray emission from more powerful jets such as 3c 273 @xcite and pks 0637 - 752 @xcite , but only by invoking a large bulk lorentz factor for a jet placed at small angle to the line of sight .",
    "it is believed , however , that the cen a jet lies at a large angle ( 50@xmath67 - 80@xmath67 ) to our line of sight @xcite .",
    "the ssc mechanism can be rejected as the density of radio photons is even lower than cmb photons , making any such model even more unlikely .",
    "another possible source of seed photons is beamed optical emission from the active nucleus @xcite . in the unified agn model ,",
    "cen a is considered to be a misdirected bl lac @xcite , so the beamed emission from the nucleus , unseen by us , could be quite large @xcite .",
    "electron energies of @xmath69 are required to boost optical photons into the x - ray regime . at knot a1",
    ", the synchrotron frequency of these low energy electrons is below 1 mhz ( assuming the equipartition magnetic field of 61 @xmath3 g ) , which is unobservable .",
    "the observed x - ray spectral index ( energy index 0.9 - 1.4 ) of the inner jet , however , is much steeper than the radio spectral index ( 0.4 - 0.6 ) between 1.4 and 4.87 ghz .",
    "unless the spectral index of the unseen electrons is dramatically steeper than that of the electrons producing the observed radio emission , it is not possible for a significant fraction of the x - ray emission to be due to this mechanism because of these spectral differences .    on the basis of the morphological similarities between the radio and x - ray emission and the limitations of competing models",
    ", it has previously been concluded that both the x - ray and radio flux from the jet originate in synchrotron emission from a population of ultrarelativistic electrons .",
    "the knots are presumably sites of shocks where particles are accelerated to @xmath70 10@xmath71 to produce the observed x - ray emission , assuming an equipartition magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the main argument against a synchrotron hypothesis has been that the lifetime due to synchrotron emission of the ultra - relativistic particles is considerably less than the travel time down the jet , thus requiring that the particles be reaccelerated @xcite , perhaps multiple times , as they travel along the jet to the radio lobe .",
    "in fact , in the inner jet region , the particles must undergo local accelerations multiple times within a knot .",
    "the lifetime of the x - ray emitting electrons in the inner jet is @xmath020 years , an order of magnitude less than the travel time from the nucleus to knot b. the lifetime of the particles beyond knot b is longer ( @xmath060 years ) due to the lower magnetic field , but still considerably less than the travel time into the radio lobe .",
    "based on estimates of the knot sizes from _",
    "einstein _ observations ( hundreds of parsecs ) , it was argued that the large volumes of the knots pushed acceleration models to their limits @xcite .",
    "this criticism is considerably weakened based on our _ chandra _ observations because each previously observed x - ray knot is actually composed of several smaller knots . thus the knot volume and the shock sizes are considerably smaller ( tens of pc rather than hundreds of pc ) than previously supposed .",
    "local acceleration of the electrons within the knots is still a necessary component of this model , however .",
    "the morphological differences between the x - ray and radio emission complicate this simple model for the emission .",
    "these differences argue strongly against the simple hypothesis that a single , spatially coincident , population of relativistic electrons is responsible for both the x - ray and radio emission @xcite in the nuclear and inner jet regions , except perhaps at knots n1/nx1 and a1/ax1 . our data support a model in which the x - ray emission is indeed synchrotron radiation from relativistic particles , but the radio emission originates , at least in part , from a spatially distinct , less energetic population of electrons .",
    "the only other extragalactic jet that has been as well studied as the cen a jet is that in m87 , and there are some remarkable morphological similarities between the two jets .",
    "small differences between the x - ray , optical , and radio morphology of the jet in m87 on roughly the same spatial scale as those described here have been reported @xcite .",
    "in particular , recent _ chandra _ observations of the m87 jet have detected morphological differences remarkably similar to those seen here @xcite .",
    "hst imaging and polarimetric observations of m87 have provided evidence that the more energetic particles responsible for the optical and x - ray emission from the m87 jet are located closer to the axis of the jet which is surrounded by a sheath or cocoon of lower - energy particles responsible for the radio emission .",
    "the knots in the m87 jet are identified as the sites of shocks in the flow where the magnetic fields are compressed and the particles accelerated @xcite .",
    "the optical and x - ray emission is then due to synchrotron radiation at the sites of the shocks .",
    "differences between the optical and radio emission are caused by particle diffusion and aging .",
    "a similar model can be used to qualitatively describe all the features of the bright x - ray / radio knots of the cen a inner jet .",
    "the differences in the positions of the knots in the x - ray and radio emission are naturally explained by particle aging .",
    "this hypothesis could be greatly strengthened if optical emission could be detected between the various radio and x - ray knots , but the dark dust lane makes such a detection unlikely @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is now becoming clear that such morphological differences are a common feature of x - ray and radio emission from fr i galaxies @xcite .",
    "the existence of shock sites and the generation of x - ray emitting plasma may be a fundamental feature of jets in fr i galaxies .",
    "we have presented high - resolution _ chandra_/acis - i x - ray images and spectra of the x - ray jet in centaurus a and have found the following :    1 .   in the inner arcminute of the jet ,",
    "there are significant morphological differences between the radio and x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray and radio positions of the two knots closest to the nucleus ( nx1 and ax1 ) agree to within the precision of our absolute astrometry ( @xmath23 ) , but beyond knot ax1 ( @xmath0250 pc from the nucleus ) , there are significant differences up to @xmath090 pc between the positions of the x - ray and radio peaks .",
    "2 .   given the offsets of the radio and x - ray knots , there are large ( factor of @xmath03 ) variations in the ratio of x - ray to radio flux in the inner jet region . in the inner jet and the vicinity of radio knot b ,",
    "the radio to x - ray spectral indices of the x - ray bright knots and radio bright knots are about 0.9 and 1.0 , respectively .",
    "3 .   at a linear resolution of @xmath030 pc ( @xmath72 )",
    "the jet contains at least 31 knots or enhancements in x - ray emission embedded within continuous diffuse emission extending about 4 kpc from the nucleus .",
    "each previously observed x - ray knot is composed of several knots embedded within diffuse emission .",
    "the spectra of several regions of the jet are well fit by an absorbed power - law model , and although we can not exclude thermal models , there is no statistically significant evidence for any emission lines .",
    "the spectrum of the jet beyond knot b , which is dominated by the diffuse , unresolved component , is similar to that of the bright knots of the inner jet .",
    "5 .   at the bright x - ray knot ax1 ,",
    "the width of the jet in the x - ray and radio bandpasses is similar . beyond this knot into the ne radio lobe",
    ", however , the x - ray jet appears to be narrower than the radio jet .",
    "the x - ray jet appears to be well collimated from the nucleus into the ne radio lobe .",
    "these results strengthen the case that the x - ray emission from the cen a jet is due to synchrotron radiation from ultra - relativistic particles , and that the knots are shock sites where the particles are re - energized as they travel along the jet",
    ". there are strong arguments against thermal and inverse - compton models for the x - ray emission , none of which has been negated by these observations .",
    "the strongest arguments against the synchrotron hypothesis were the large shock volume , the difficulty of particle re - energization , and the necessity of multiple re - acceleration within a knot .",
    "these have been significantly weakened by this observation as the sizes of the knots are considerably smaller ( tens of pc rather than hundreds ) than previously supposed .",
    "in addition , both the spectra and the radio / x - ray morphological differences we observe are consistent with the synchrotron hypothesis .",
    "_ chandra _ has now detected x - ray emission from the jets of a significant number of fr i radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "the radio / x - ray morphologies , the spectral indices and the x - ray spectra of these objects are remarkably similar to those of cen a. we suggest that x - ray emission may , in fact , be a common aspect of the jets in these galaxies , and that the shock acceleration of particles to @xmath7010@xmath71 may be an integral feature of the hydrodynamics of such jets .",
    "_ chandra _ will allow us to make a systematic study of the x - ray emission from extragalactic jets to better assess the relationship between bulk flows and particle acceleration .",
    "this work was supported by nasa contracts nas8 - 38248 , nas8 - 39073 , the chandra science center , and the smithsonian institution .",
