    "while ligand @xmath8 states play major role in the electronic properties of cuprate superconductors ( the most studied unconventional superconductors ) , the main contribution at the fermi level , @xmath9 in the fe - based materials arises from the fe 3@xmath10 orbitals .",
    "these systems are more complex than cuprates due to the contribution of multiple bands at @xmath9 and drastic changes in the fermi surface topology arising from magnetic and structural transitions . for example , the two dimensional hole pockets at @xmath1-point in the tetragonal phase exhibit a transition to three dimensional topology at low temperatures @xcite and in ct phase , they disappear due to the shift of the energy bands .",
    "the disappearance of the fermi surface in ct phase rules out the possibility of fermi surface nesting necessary for the transition to the sdw state .",
    "the fe - based systems , in general , are found to be moderately correlated and inclusion of electron correlation strength , @xmath11 in the calculations renormalizes the energy bands without drastic change in the ground state properties @xcite .",

    "et al._@xcite showed that the hund s coupling , @xmath12 ( @xmath130.8 ev ) influences the electronic structure more strongly than the changes found due to @xmath11 ( @xmath13 4 ev ) .",
    "they also showed that upon transition from t to ct phase , the @xmath14 bands become the least renormalized orbital from the highest renormalized one , which was attributed to increased hybridization of fe 3@xmath14 orbital with as 4@xmath15 and 4@xmath16 orbitals .",
    "the appearance of the ct phase under pressure and/or on suitable doping @xcite has been attributed to the increased hybridization among as 4@xmath8 orbitals along the compressed @xmath5 axis .",
    "_ @xcite found that the fe spin state strongly depends on the @xmath5 axis reduction in ct phase .",
    "based on fixed moment calculation , he showed that reduction by about half of the fe magnetic moment corresponds to the @xmath5 axis collapse to the experimental value .",
    "thus , there is a finite magnetic moment present at the fe sites in the ct phase when it is not superconducting .",
    "evidently , understanding of the importance of fe moment in superconductivity is still at its infancy and needs further investigation .",

    "in fact , superconductivity with @xmath19 @xmath18 10 k at 0.69 gpa pressure has been detected by several groups @xcite .",
    "subsequent experiments , however , did not find superconductivity although ct phase could be reached on application of pressure . it was suggested that the earlier measurements carried out using convectional liquid medium clamp pressure cell might have made the pressure quasi hydrostatic due to freezing of the medium .",
    "these later results obtained using helium as a pressure medium question the relation of superconductivity to ct phase and in line with other views suggesting non - magnetic behavior in ct phase that rules out spin - fluctuation . evidently , the observance / non - observance of superconductivity under pressure , non - observance of other structural phases under pressure , no superconductivity in ambient conditions , _ etc . _ are curious and remains to be an outstanding puzzle in this field .",
    "a study of the reported resistivity data exhibiting superconductivity reveal an interesting scenario ; the transitions in the resistivity data at @xmath7 = 0.23 gpa are significantly broad . on the other hand , the results exhibiting absence of superconductivity show sharp transitions throughout the pressure range involving the transitions from t to o , o to ct and t to ct phases .",
    "moreover , the superconductivity always found to appear at a pressure where the system is in the proximity of the transition to ct phase or some volume fraction is already in ct phase .",
    "thus , the origin of superconductivity in this material appears to have relation to the multi - crystallographic phases within the intermediate pressure regime .",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite , @xmath20 spin rotation @xcite , and neutron diffraction studies @xcite support the possibilities of coexisting o , ct and t phases .",
    "some studies indicated signature of an unidentified third phase appearing in the intermediate pressure regime @xcite . while the magnetic order in single or multiple phase scenario can be attributed to the o phase , it is difficult to delineate the phase responsible for superconductivity .",
    "clearly , superconductivity does not appear to be related to pure ct or o phase under pressure @xcite .",
    "then the question is ; how the superconductivity sets in cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 under pressure ? how non hydrostatic pressure helps to get supeconductivity while hydrostatic pressure does not ?",
    "superconductivity also appears via doping of charge carriers in these material - how different is that mechanism from the pressure induced one ?    here , we studied the detailed electronic structure of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 employing density functional theoretical ( dft ) methods at varied conditions with an emphasis on the tendency of the system to evolve to a certain electronic structure due to change in structural parameters induced by the pressure .",

    "the covalency between ca , as and fe states appear to play the key role in deriving the electronic properties of this system .",

    "all our calculations indicate that the magnetic configuration in the ct structure has higher energy compared to the non - magnetic phase .",
    "the magnetic moment decreases as the fe - as bond length decreases .",
    "this can be understood considering the fact that decrease in fe - as bondlength makes the conduction electrons more itinerant and hence less local moment .",
    "it is puzzling that the fe - as bondlength is smallest in ct@xmath32 structure and a small decrease in fe - as bond length from 2.3405   in ct@xmath33 structure to 2.338   in ct@xmath32 structure changes the magnetic moment from @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "the above results establish that the fe spin state is highly sensitive to the fe - as hybridization , which is linked to the _ pnictogen height _ too .",
    "the shorter as - as distance leads to increased hybridization within the as - plane and higher degree of as @xmath8 electron itineracy . however , the local character of the fe @xmath10 electrons remain less affected . on the other hand , higher fe - as hybridization leads to larger covalent splitting of the fe - as bonding and antibonding bands leading to a shift of the valence bands . some of the bands shifts below @xmath9 and become completely filled .",
    "the energy bands crossing the fermi level will have higher itineracy and hence less local character , which is presumably one of the reasons for the reduction of fe moment and the resistivity .",
    "the calculated fe - as bond length in the afm ground state with orthorhombic structure is 2.3654  , which is larger than that in ct phase and shorter than the one in t phase .",
    "the fe spin moment is found to be 1.87 @xmath50 , which is much larger than the experimental value of 0.80 @xmath50 .",
    "various theoretical studies tried to capture the experimental moment by varying @xmath6 ( experimental value = 0.3664 ) .",
    "it is observed that the spin moment becomes closer to the experimental value for the @xmath6 values of 0.3567 @xcite .",
    "it is clear that @xmath6 and hence the _ pnictogen height _ is an important parameter leading to varied electronic properties in this system .",
    "moreover , these results establish that the ct phase possesses finite magnetic moment as also found experimentally in magnetic susceptibility measurements for almost all kinds of phases prepared so far .",

    "ca 4@xmath2 contributions in orthorhombic and tetragonal phases look almost similar with major intensities above @xmath9 , a reasonably intense feature between -6 to -3 ev and almost no intensity in the vicinity of @xmath9 .",
    "while the intensity above @xmath9 remains dominant in the ct phase too like other cases , there is significant redistribution of pdos in the lower energy regime .",
    "most importantly the contribution in the vicinity of @xmath9 becomes almost double of the contributions in other two structures .",
    "the contributions in the energy range -3 to -6 ev appear due to the fe - as bonding bands with dominant as 4@xmath8 character and -2.5 to 0 ev is contributed by anti - bonding bands with dominant fe 3@xmath10 character .",
    "the intense feature between -2.5 to -4 ev in as 4@xmath8 pdos are the non - bonding as 4@xmath8 states .",
    "the features in ca 4@xmath2 pdos resemble well with structures in the as 4@xmath8 pdos as these states emerges due to the hybridization of ca 4@xmath2 states with as 4@xmath8 states .",
    "thus , the enhancement of 4@xmath2 contributions below @xmath9 can be attributed to enhanced hybridization of ca and as states due to compression of @xmath5 axis in the ct phase .",
    "charge reservoir layers , generally insulating in nature , are believed to play an important role in superconductivity @xcite as these layers help to preserve two dimensionality of the system and can protect the conduction layers via screening of substitutional and/or other type of disorder induced effects .",
    "effective two dimensional electronic structure seem to be essential to achieve high superconducting transition temperature and almost all the superconductors ( conventional and unconventional ) having high transition temperature possess two dimensional electronic structure .",

    "is observed in collapsed tetragonal phase , which reduces the total energy of the system .",

    "the enhancement of fe - as hybridization in the ct phase presumably leads to higher degree of itineracy relevant for the changes in electrical resistivity in this system .",
    "interestingly , the changes in ca 4@xmath2 partial density of states suggest enhancement of ca - as hybridization with the decrease in @xmath5 , which is significant in the context of superconductivity as it is believed that such layers act as charge reservoir layer in various high temperature superconductors .",

    "<S> * cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 exhibits collapsed tetragonal ( ct ) structure and varied exotic behavior under pressure at low temperatures that led to debate on linking the structural changes to its exceptional electronic properties like superconductivity , magnetism , etc . here , we investigate the electronic structure of cafe@xmath0as@xmath0 forming in different structures employing density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the results indicate better stability of the ct phase with enhancement in hybridization induced effects and shift of the energy bands towards lower energies . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi surface centered around @xmath1 point gradually vanishes with the increase in pressure . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the nesting between the hole and electron fermi surfaces associated to the spin density wave state disappears indicating a pathway to achieve the proximity to quantum fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic moment at the fe sites diminishes in the ct phase consistent with the magnetic susceptibility results . </S>",
    "<S> notably , the hybridization of ca 4@xmath2 states ( ca - layer may be treated as a charge reservoir layer akin to those in cuprate superconductors ) is significantly enhanced in the ct phase revealing its relevance in its interesting electronic properties . * </S>"
