    "quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the theory of the strong interaction , is an su(3 ) gauge theory of quarks and gluons .",
    "unfortunately , because of the complexity of the theory , it is not possible to solve it exactly .    generally , when a theory can not be solved directly , one can try to make a perturbative expansion of the theory in terms of its coupling constant .",
    "however , the coupling constant @xmath4 of qcd becomes very large at low energies , too large for a perturbative treatement ( see figure [ coupl ] ) .",
    "+     vs. the energy scale @xmath5 @xcite.,width=264 ]    in 1974 , t hooft @xcite suggested to generalize qcd from three to @xmath6 colors .",
    "he found that the inverse of the number of colors could be an expansion parameter of qcd .",
    "later on , based on general arguments , witten @xcite analyzed the properties of mesons and baryon systems in this limit .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion of qcd @xcite has been proved a useful approach to study baryon spectroscopy .",
    "it has been applied to the ground state baryons @xcite as well as to excited states , in particular to the negative parity spin - flavor @xmath7$]-plet ( @xmath8 band ) @xcite , to the positive parity roper resonance belonging to the @xmath9$]-plet ( @xmath10 band ) @xcite and to the @xmath11$]-plet ( @xmath10 band ) @xcite . in this approach",
    "the main features of the quark model emerge naturally and in addition new information is provided as for example on the spin - orbit problem .    in this study",
    "we explore its applicability to the @xmath3$]-plet ( @xmath12 band ) for the first time .",
    "the number of experimentally known resonances in the 23 gev region @xcite , expected to belong to this multiplet is quite restricted . among the five possible candidates",
    "there are two four - star resonances , @xmath13 and @xmath14 , one three - star resonance @xmath15 , one two - star resonance @xmath16 and one one - star resonance @xmath17 .",
    "this is an exploratory study which will allow us to make some predictions .",
    "the aim is to compute the mass operators for the @xmath18 $ ] multiplet in a @xmath0 expansion .",
    "this paper summarizes the results presented in refs .",
    "baryons are color singlet bound states composed of three quarks",
    ".    one of the quantum numbers that characterises the quarks is the flavor .",
    "six different flavors have been observed : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 . here",
    ", we consider only the three first ones .",
    "the total wave function of baryons @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the space , spin , flavor and color parts respectively .",
    "the color part @xmath31 is always antisymmetric , _",
    "i.e. _ a colorless state .",
    "so the remaining part must be symmetric because the total wave function must be antisymmetric as quarks are fermions .",
    "one can introduce the su@xmath32(3 ) symmetry .",
    "physically , if this symmetry is exact the mass of the three different quarks is the same , _ i.e. _ @xmath33 .",
    "one can classify baryons with respect to their flavor symmetry properties described by the irreducible representations of the su@xmath34 group .",
    "we obtain the flavor diagrams of figure [ flavor ] .",
    "particles belonging to the octet have a spin 1/2 . for the decuplet",
    ", they have a spin 3/2 . with exact su@xmath32(3 )",
    ", all the particles in each weight diagram have the same mass .",
    "( 3 ) flavor diagrams for the octet on the left and for the decuplet on the right.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ] ( 3 ) flavor diagrams for the octet on the left and for the decuplet on the right.,title=\"fig:\",width=113 ]",
    "one has shown that su(6 ) is a good symmetry in @xmath35 limit .",
    "that means that the first order operator of the expansion of the mass operator will be su(6 ) symmetric .",
    "when we consider an exact su(6 ) symmetry , we assume that the mass of the particles that belong to the octet is the same that the ones that belong to the decuplet .",
    "in fact in su(6 ) we have a spin symmetry and a flavor symmetry , _ i.e. _ @xmath36    the @xmath37 operators are : @xmath38 where @xmath39 are the spin generators , @xmath40 the flavor generators , and @xmath41 are the spin - flavor generators .",
    "it is possible to treat the @xmath19 baryon as a system of three non - relativistic quarks bound by a confining potentiel .    in figure [ spectrum ]",
    ", we schematically draw the level sequence of the baryon spectrum up to the @xmath42 band with a linear confinement . to label the levels ,",
    "the notation @xmath43 $ ] is used , where @xmath44 represents the dimension of the su(6 ) irreducible representations , @xmath45 the angular momentum of the states and @xmath46 the parity .     and 2 levels of the baryon spectrum.,width=207 ]",
    "the mass spectrum is calculated in the @xmath0 expansion up to and including @xmath47 effects .",
    "the mass operator must be rotationally invariant , parity and time reversal even .",
    "we consider the su@xmath32(3 ) symmetry breaking to the first order .",
    "the isospin breaking is neglected . in term of the mass of the quarks , we assume that @xmath48 .    from the @xmath0 expansion",
    ", one can write the mass operator as @xmath49 here , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) are su@xmath32(3 ) symmetry operators .",
    "the operators @xmath52 ( @xmath51 ) provide su@xmath32(3 ) breaking and are defined to have vanishing matrix elements for nonstrange baryons .",
    "the relation ( [ mass ] ) contains the effective coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath54 as parameters .",
    "they represent reduced matrix elements that encode the qcd dynamics .",
    "the above operators and the values of the corresponding coefficients which we obtained from fitting the experimentally know masses are given in table [ fit ] .",
    ".operators of eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) and coefficients resulting from the fit with @xmath55 . [ cols=\"<,<,>,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the values of the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath56 obtained from the fit are presented in table [ fit ] , as already mentioned .    due to the lack of experimental data in the strange sector it was not possible to include all the operators @xmath52 in the fit in order to obtain some reliable predictions . as the breaking of su@xmath32(3 ) is dominated by @xmath57",
    "we included only this operator in eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) and neglected the contribution of the operators @xmath58 and @xmath59 . at a later stage ,",
    "when more data will hopefully be available , all analytical work performed here could be used to improve the fit .",
    "that is why table [ fit ] contains results for @xmath53 ( @xmath60 = 1 , 2 and 3 ) and @xmath56 only .",
    "the @xmath61 of the fit is 0.26 , where the number of degrees of freedom ( dof ) is equal to one ( five data and four coefficients ) .",
    "the first column of table [ multiplet ] contains the 56 states ( each state having a @xmath62 multiplicity from assuming an exact su(2)-isospin symmetry ) .",
    "the columns two to five show the partial contribution of each operator included in the fit , multiplied by the corresponding coefficient @xmath53 or @xmath56 .",
    "the column six gives the total mass according to eq .",
    "( [ mass ] ) .",
    "the errors shown in the predictions result from the errors on the coefficients @xmath53 and @xmath56 given in table [ fit ] .",
    "as there are only five experimental data available , nineteen of these masses are predictions .",
    "the main question is , of course , how reliable is this fit .",
    "the answer can be summarized as follows :    * the main part of the mass is provided by the spin - flavor singlet operator @xmath63 , which is @xmath64 . *",
    "the spin - orbit contribution given by @xmath65 is small .",
    "this fact reinforces the practice used in constituent quark models where the spin - orbit contribution is usually neglected . *",
    "the breaking of the su(6 ) symmetry keeping the flavor symmetry exact is mainly due to the spin - spin operator @xmath66 .",
    "this hyperfine interaction produces a splitting between octet and decuplet states of approximately 130 mev . * as it was not possible to include the contribution of @xmath58 and @xmath59 in our fit , a degeneracy appears between @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "in conclusion we have studied the spectrum of highly excited resonances in the 23 gev mass region by describing them as belonging to the @xmath3 $ ] multiplet .",
    "this is the first study of such excited states based on the @xmath0 expansion of qcd .",
    "a better description should include multiplet mixing , following the lines developed , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "better experimental values for highly excited non - strange baryons as well as more data for the @xmath69 and @xmath70 baryons are needed in order to understand the role of the operator @xmath58 within a multiplet and for the octet - decuplet mixing . with better data",
    "the analytic work performed here will help to make reliable predictions in the large @xmath6 limit formalism .",
