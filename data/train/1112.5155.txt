    "among the various proposals to characterize the dark matter in our universe , the scenario where the dark matter is constituted by weakly interacting majorana particles stands as the most promising one . in this scenario",
    ", thermal scatterings of standard model particles in the early universe can produce a relic density of dark matter particles which is of the correct order of magnitude , when the interaction strength is of the order of the weak interaction strength and the dark matter mass is about 1 tev .",
    "furthermore , this scenario has the appealing feature that the dark matter particle might be directly detected in underground detectors , indirectly detected in cosmic ray detectors , gamma - ray and neutrino telescopes , and directly produced at the lhc .    in this paper",
    "we will focus on the possibility of indirectly detecting majorana dark matter particles via their self - annihilation in the milky way dark matter halo .",
    "concretely we will study the annihilation process into two fermions and one gauge boson which , under some circumstances , can have a non - negligible or even a larger cross section than the lowest order annihilation process into two fermions . more specifically",
    ", the @xmath4-wave contribution to the thermally averaged cross section for the @xmath5 process is helicity suppressed by the mass of the final fermion , while the @xmath6-wave contribution is suppressed by the small velocity of the dark matter particles in the milky way halo .",
    "in contrast , for the @xmath7 process the @xmath4-wave contribution is no longer suppressed , due to the associated emission of a vector in the final state . as a result",
    ", the @xmath7 processes can even have a larger cross section than the @xmath5 processes as the lifting of the helicity suppression can compensate the suppression due to the additional coupling @xmath8 , provided the mediating scalar particles are not too heavy .",
    "dark matter annihilations into two fermions and one photon with the mediation of a heavy scalar particle were first studied in the framework of the minimal supersymmetric standard model in neutralino annihilations @xcite , and explored in a number of subsequent papers  @xcite .",
    "it was also pointed out that this process not only could have a sizable cross - section but also produces a gamma - ray with a very peculiar spectral shape which , if detected in gamma - ray telescopes , could be unequivocally identified as being originated in dark matter annihilations  @xcite .",
    "if the mediating scalar particle is electrically charged it must necessarily carry hypercharge and therefore the annihilation process must also produce weak gauge bosons and , in turn , antiprotons .",
    "this process has been studied in @xcite employing a toy model where the dark matter particle is a singlet under the standard model gauge group and the mediating particle is a @xmath1 doublet .",
    "the constraints on the annihilation cross section in this model from the non - observation of an excess in the cosmic antiproton - to - proton fraction measured by pamela were derived in @xcite .",
    "lastly , annihilations into quarks , so that the emission of a gluon is allowed in the final state were discussed in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we aim to extend this analysis , considering various toy models where the dark matter particle is a @xmath1 singlet or doublet , which couples to the left - handed or right - handed leptons or quarks of the first generation . for each case",
    ", we will calculate the cross sections for the different @xmath7 processes and we will calculate the constraints on the cross sections from the pamela measurements of the antiproton - to - proton fraction  @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : leptons ] , we discuss in detail the cross sections for the various electromagnetic and electroweak internal bremsstrahlung processes occurring for @xmath1 singlet as well as doublet dark matter particle coupling to leptons .",
    "the corresponding cases , when assuming a coupling to quarks , are discussed in section [ sec : quarks ] . in section",
    "[ sec : pbar ] we present the constraints on the cross sections from the pamela measurements of the antiproton - to - proton fraction , and translate them into upper limits on an astrophysical boost factor for the various toy models .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "our full analytical results for the cross sections of all @xmath9 processes considered in this work can be found in the appendix .",
    "we consider an extension of the standard model by one majorana fermion , @xmath10 , which we assume to constitute the dominant component of dark matter in the universe , and one scalar particle , @xmath11 , which mediates the annihilation process into light fermions .",
    "the lagrangian is @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the standard model lagrangian which includes a potential for the higgs doublet @xmath14 , @xmath15 . on",
    "the other hand @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the parts of the lagrangian involving just the majorana fermion @xmath10 and the scalar particle @xmath11 , respectively , and which are given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the covariant derivative .",
    "lastly , @xmath20 and @xmath21 denote the fermionic and scalar interaction terms of the new particles to the leptons and to the higgs doublet .",
    "these terms depend on the details of the model and will be discussed case by case below .",
    "the quantum numbers of the relevant standard model particles under the gauge group @xmath22 are : @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "the quantum numbers of the dark matter particle and the scalar @xmath11 are constrained in our setup by the requirement that the dark matter particle is colorless and electrically neutral , and by the requirement that a yukawa coupling to the leptons ( either left - handed or right - handed ) is invariant under the standard model gauge group .",
    "we will assume in the following that the dark matter particle only couples to the first generation of leptons , which can be ensured by postulating that the extra scalar particle @xmath11 carries electron lepton number @xmath26 , while the dark matter particle does not carry lepton number .",
    "lastly , in order to guarantee the stability of the dark matter particle , we impose a @xmath27 discrete symmetry under which @xmath10 and @xmath11 are odd while the standard model particles are even .    in the scenarios of interest for this paper , the intermediate scalar is electrically charged and could possibly lead to experimental signatures in collider experiments .",
    "precise measurements of the invisible decay width of the @xmath28 boson at lep set the upper bound @xmath29 mev  @xcite , which rules out the existence of exotic charged scalar particles with mass below 40 gev  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the opal collaboration searched for an excess with respect to the standard model expectations of dilepton events with missing energy induced by the production of exotic scalar charged particles which decay into an electron and an invisible particle ( in the framework of supersymmetry , the production of selectrons which decay into an electron and the lightest neutralino ) .",
    "the non - observation of an excess in a sample of 680 pb@xmath30 of @xmath31 collisions at center - of - mass energy between 192 gev and 209 gev , leads to the lower bound @xmath32 gev , assuming @xmath33 gev  @xcite .",
    "a similar search was undertaken by the l3 collaboration using a sample of 450 pb@xmath30 collisions at @xmath34 gev , resulting in the lower bound @xmath35 gev assuming @xmath36 gev  @xcite , by the aleph collaboration using a sample of 207 pb@xmath30 collisions at @xmath37 gev , resulting in @xmath38 gev assuming @xmath39 gev  @xcite and by the delphi collaboration using a sample of 609 pb@xmath30 collisions at @xmath40 gev , resulting in @xmath41 gev assuming @xmath39 gev , and @xmath42 gev assuming @xmath43 gev and @xmath44 gev  @xcite . for smaller mass splittings the detection efficiency",
    "is significantly reduced and the lower bounds derived by the lep experiments can be avoided .",
    "when the dark matter particle is a @xmath1 singlet , its hypercharge must be zero in order to render an electrically neutral particle , hence the gauge quantum numbers must be @xmath45 . on the other hand , the gauge quantum numbers of the scalar @xmath11 depend on whether the dark matter particle couples to the right - handed electron singlet or to the left - handed electron doublet .",
    "if the dark matter has a yukawa coupling to the right - handed electron singlet and a scalar field @xmath11 , then gauge invariance requires @xmath46 . with these quantum numbers the only interaction terms in the lagrangian",
    "are : @xmath47 in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) this possibility is realized if @xmath10 is the bino and @xmath11 is the right - handed selectron , @xmath48 .    on the other hand , if the dark matter only couples to the left - handed electron doublet then @xmath49 .",
    "the interaction terms are then : @xmath50 in the mssm , this possibility is realized if @xmath10 is the bino and @xmath11 the left - handed selectron doublet , @xmath51 .",
    "after the electroweak symmetry breaking , the mass of the electrically charged scalar @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 .",
    "if the dark matter couples to the left - handed electron doublet , there exists also a neutral scalar with mass given by @xmath54 .",
    "we will assume that @xmath55 , such that the majorana fermion @xmath10 is stable and can constitute the dark matter .",
    "the interactions lead to a thermal production of @xmath10 in the early universe that is compatible with the wmap value if the coupling is of order one @xmath56 and the masses lie between the weak and the tev scale  @xcite",
    ".    the annihilation of dark matter in the milky way today can proceed via the @xmath57 annihilation channels @xmath58 , as well as @xmath59 .",
    "however , the cross - sections @xmath60 are highly suppressed because the @xmath4-wave contribution @xmath61 is helicity suppressed , while the @xmath6-wave contribution @xmath62 is suppressed by the dark matter velocity @xmath63 in the milky way halo .",
    "the helicity suppression can be lifted by emitting an additional spin-1 particle in the final state @xcite .",
    "the lifting of the helicity suppression can compensate the suppression due to the additional coupling @xmath8 provided the mediating scalar particles are not too heavy , typically @xmath64  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the dominant annihilation processes are @xmath9 channels , like @xmath65 , @xmath66 or @xmath67 .",
    "note that one could similarly consider a coupling of the dark matter particle to the leptons of the second or third generation .",
    "the cross - sections for the @xmath9 processes and the constraints from the antiproton flux that will be discussed later are independent of the lepton flavor to a good accuracy . due to the larger masses of the @xmath68 and @xmath69 leptons ,",
    "the helicity suppression of the @xmath57 annihilation cross - sections is less pronounced than for a coupling to electrons , while the velocity suppressed contributions to the @xmath57 annihilation cross - sections are flavor - independent .",
    "the annihilation mode @xmath65 leads to a gamma ray signal with a pronounced peak at the dark matter mass , that is potentially observable by the fermi - lat ( see  @xcite for a recent discussion ) and by current and future iacts  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the annihilation channels involving weak gauge bosons yield a primary contribution to the cosmic flux of antiprotons . in the following",
    ", we will analyze the relative strength of these channels , and in section 4 we will derive upper limits on the cross - section from the pamela measurement of the antiproton to proton ratio  @xcite .",
    "let us first consider the possibility that the dark matter particle @xmath10 couples to right - handed electrons . since the mediating particle @xmath11 carries hypercharge and electric charge , the @xmath9 annihilation channels @xmath70 and @xmath71 are possible @xcite .",
    "the branching ratios compared to the @xmath57 annihilation cross section are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : crosssection1 ] . for dark matter masses",
    "@xmath72 , far above the @xmath28-threshold , the ratio of the cross sections for the electromagnetic and the electroweak bremsstrahlung processes approach constant values given by the ratio of the respective coupling constants : @xmath73 the general formulas for the double differential cross sections and for arbitrary dark matter masses are given in the appendix . in order to obtain a gauge - invariant result it is important to take into account the diagrams for which the gauge boson is emitted off the internal line and off the final state particles ( later on , when considering doublet dark matter , also contributions from initial state radiation have to be included ) .",
    "the corresponding feynman diagrams are also shown in the appendix . in the following",
    ", we will refer to all these processes as internal bremsstrahlung ( ib ) . as noted before ,",
    "these comprise also the contributions from final state radiation in general .",
    "note that the contributions from soft and collinear emission , which are in principle logarithmically enhanced , are typically negligible in this context because they are helicity suppressed , like the @xmath57 processes .",
    "instead , the dominant contribution arises from the diagrams where the gauge boson is emitted either off the internal line , or from a final state particle with an off - shell intermediate state ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "the dependence of the cross sections on the mass @xmath74 is shown in the upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : crosssection1 ] .",
    "it is apparent from the figure that the branching ratio of the @xmath9 processes is largest when @xmath74 is close to @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath76 , the cross section of the @xmath9 processes fall of as @xmath77 , while the @xmath57 cross sections scale like @xmath78 .",
    "the former remain dominant as long as the dark matter mass and the mass of the mediating particle are of comparable size , roughly @xmath79 .",
    "the qualitative properties discussed here are common also to most other cases considered below . however , there are some quantitative and also qualitative differences which we will stress in the following",
    ".      if the dark matter particle @xmath10 couples to the left - handed electron doublet , it can give rise to annihilations into final states involving @xmath80 or @xmath81 bosons .",
    "note that this case has been discussed in detail in ref .",
    "we will briefly review it here for completeness .",
    "the branching ratios compared to the @xmath57 annihilation cross section are shown in the lower part of fig .  [",
    "fig : crosssection1 ] . for @xmath72 , and assuming that @xmath82 , the asymptotic values are again given by the ratios of the appropriate couplings : @xmath83 here @xmath84 .",
    "generically , one expects a non - zero mass splitting of the neutral and charged components of @xmath11 induced by the breaking of the electroweak symmetry , @xmath85 .",
    "compared to the degenerate limit , the branching ratios get modified due to two effects .",
    "first , the masses in the t - channel propagators of the mediating particles corresponding to the charged and the neutral component of @xmath11 differ from each other .",
    "second , the mass splitting opens up a new channel , namely the annihilation into longitudinally polarized @xmath81-bosons . in the limit @xmath86 , the branching ratios are approximately given by @xmath87\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the ratio @xmath90 , in contrast , is not affected by the mass splitting .",
    "the emission of longitudinal @xmath81 bosons also leads to a spectrum that is harder compared to the case @xmath82  @xcite .",
    "analytical expressions for the double differential cross sections , from which the spectra can be easily obtained , are given in the appendix .       where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are the electric charge and the weak isospin , respectively , with @xmath93 and @xmath94",
    ". for quarks , one has @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "the spectra of the vector bosons can be obtained by integrating the differential cross - section over the fermion energy , with integration limits given by @xmath97 .",
    "the total cross - section can be obtained by integrating over the remaining energy with limits @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams are shown in part ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : z_diagram ] for the exemplary case @xmath100 .        here",
    "we report the @xmath9 cross sections for the case of @xmath1-doublet majorana dark matter @xmath10 that arise from a coupling to the sm fermions @xmath2 via a mediating scalar @xmath105 .",
    "there can be additional contributions due to @xmath57 annihilations into @xmath106 or @xmath107 , with a subsequent decay of one of the gauge bosons .",
    "we do not include them here for simplicity .",
    "their size depends on the ratio @xmath108 of gauge interactions and the interactions with the scalar @xmath105 .",
    "the main difference compared to the case of @xmath1 singlet dark matter are additional contributions from initial state radiation . for annihilation into @xmath109 or @xmath110 , there are no such contributions because the dark matter is electrically neutral and uncoloured .",
    "therefore , the cross - section is identical to the one from above .",

    "<S> we study in this paper the scenario where the dark matter is constituted by majorana particles which couple to a light standard model fermion and an extra scalar via a yukawa coupling . in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the annihilation rate into the light fermions with the mediation of the scalar particle is strongly suppressed by the mass of the fermion . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the helicity suppression is lifted by the associated emission of a gauge boson , yielding annihilation rates which could be large enough to allow the indirect detection of the dark matter particles . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a general analysis of this scenario , calculating the annihilation cross section of the processes @xmath0 when the dark matter particle is a @xmath1 singlet or doublet , @xmath2 is a lepton or a quark , and @xmath3 is a photon , a weak gauge boson or a gluon . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the annihilation rate is particularly enhanced when the dark matter particle is degenerate in mass to the intermediate scalar particle , which is a scenario barely constrained by collider searches of exotic charged or colored particles . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we derive upper limits on the relevant cross sections from the non - observation of an excess in the cosmic antiproton - to - proton ratio measured by pamela . </S>"
