    "the precise estimate we obtain is that almost surely @xmath60 which combined with theorem [ thm : prequel ] yields theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "a natural direction in which to continue this line of research would be to study other gaussian processes with different covariance structure , see the discussion in section [ sec : gaussian ] .",
    "the key method we introduce to estimate the fourier transform of the graph measure @xmath23 is based on _ it calculus _ , which has previously been a natural framework in the theory of stochastic differential equations .",

    "there are two distinct cases we will consider depending on the direction of @xmath66 , which we give a heuristic description of here .",
    "if we ignore the random component @xmath67 , that is , set @xmath68 or @xmath69 , then standard integration using the chain rule shows that @xmath26 equals the fourier transform of lebesgue measure @xmath57 at @xmath70 , which decays to @xmath71 with the polynomial rate @xmath72 , so we are done for these directions .",
    "however , if @xmath73 is not equal to @xmath71 or @xmath69 , we still have a small random ( non - smooth ) term @xmath74 , so a classical change of variable formula or other tools from classical analysis can not be used .",
    "the new approach we introduce is to utilise tools from stochastic analysis .",
    "the key observation is that we can write @xmath75 , where the stochastic process @xmath76 is a so called _ it drift - diffusion process _ , where @xmath77 is the _ drift coefficient _ of @xmath78 and @xmath79 is the _ diffusion coefficient _ of @xmath78 .",
    "it processes have many useful analytic tools from it calculus ( see section [ sec : ito ] ) associated to them , in particular _ it s lemma _ , which works as an analogue for the chain rule .",
    "the price we pay is that it s lemma introduces some multiplicative error terms involving stochastic integrals , but they can be estimated with other tools from it calculus using moment analysis .",
    "the estimates we obtain from it calculus allow us to obtain the correct fourier decay for @xmath23 when @xmath73 is close to @xmath71 or @xmath69 with respect to @xmath80 ( more precisely , @xmath81 ) .",
    "in other words , when @xmath66 is close to pointing in the horizontal directions .",
    "thus another estimate is needed for @xmath73 bounded away from @xmath71 and @xmath69 .",
    "this is where kahane s classical work @xcite on brownian images comes into play .",
    "if we completely ignore the deterministic component @xmath82 , by setting @xmath83 or @xmath84 , then @xmath85 is the fourier transform the brownian image measure @xmath86 , that is the @xmath5 push - forward of the lebesgue measure @xmath57 on @xmath58 $ ] at @xmath70 .",
    "kahane @xcite in fact already established that almost surely the decay of @xmath87 is almost surely of the order @xmath88 so holds for these directions .",

    "see section [ sec : proof ] for more details on the main steps of the proof .      as mentioned in the introduction , fourier coefficients of @xmath23 on a set @xmath22",
    "are deeply linked to arithmetic properties of the set @xmath22 . in this section",

    "davenport - erds - leveque criterion was established in @xcite and in this form by quefflec - ramar @xcite and it is a consequence of the classical _ weyl s equidistribution criterion _ ( 1908 ) , which says that a sequence @xmath105 equidistributes if and only if the exponential sums @xmath106 for any @xmath107 . in higher dimensions one can also study analogues of equidistribution on the @xmath108-torus @xmath109 . here a sequence @xmath110 is _ equidistributed _ if in the weak topology @xmath111 weyl s criterion in the higher dimensions has the following form :    [ thm : weyl ] a sequence @xmath110 is equidistributed if and only if for any @xmath112 we have @xmath113    the natural analogue of sequences @xmath114 on the torus is to consider orbits under suitable expanding maps .",

    "the proof of theorem [ thm : delhigh ] follows the same lines as the @xmath0-version by davenport - erds - leveque and we postpone the proof until section [ sec : delhigh ] .",
