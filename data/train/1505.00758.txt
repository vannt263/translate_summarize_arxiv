    "<S> is calculated by integrating over the axial state populations of the three - dimensional trap ( see appendix  [ sec : heating - rate - model ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the model also assumes a trap depth along the radial and axial axes which we calculate from measured trap frequencies under the assumption of sinusoidal modulation . </S>",
    "<S> the trap frequencies are calibrated via lattice modulation spectroscopy  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the modulation spectra also show cross - modulation peaks at the base frequency and confirm the effect . for lattice powers corresponding to trap depths below @xmath67 , </S>",
    "<S> the model deviates from the experimental data because the harmonic oscillator approximation inherent in the rate equation model does not describe shallow lattices well .     </S>",
    "<S> lattice laser ( the @xmath25 laser has similar features ) and the seed laser taken as described in appendix  [ sec : rin - measurements ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) for low lattice powers , the high - bandwidth analog servo suppresses intensity noise below @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> the servo is conservatively tuned to work across 1.5 orders of magnitude in setpoint . the servo gain and bandwidth decrease with decreasing setpoint , leading to a larger contribution of noise from the servo electronics . </S>",
    "<S> the increased noise at frequencies corresponding to the band gaps of the optical lattice leads to the higher heating rates for low lattice powers in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : heating ] . at the same time , the servo reduces the noise below the seed laser rin in the frequency range corresponding to the hubbard model parameters  @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the lattice beams are derived from yb - doped fiber amplifiers ( nufern ) , seeded by an intensity - stable nd : yag non - planar ring oscillator laser ( innolight mephisto ) . because of the high optical power requirements , the beam path schematically shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rin](a ) is designed to be mechanically and thermally stable . at high intensities , </S>",
    "<S> many materials show thermal lensing effects that result in beam pointing and focusing changes on fast timescales . for these reasons , the beam paths ( as well as the vacuum chamber ) use fused silica optics which are less susceptible to thermal lensing because of the material s high thermal conductivity , low thermal expansion coefficient , and low index of refraction sensitivity to temperature .    </S>",
    "<S> thermal effects in @xmath69 ( tgg ) optical isolators result in a loss of isolation at high optical powers  @xcite which can lead to damage to the fiber amplifiers from backreflections . </S>",
    "<S> to provide sufficient isolation , we use two stages of tgg faraday rotators ( fr ) with fused silica brewster polarizers ( bp ) and @xmath70 waveplates ( hwp ) . to suppress thermal variation in the isolators , </S>",
    "<S> the full optical power is always incident on the isolators .    </S>",
    "<S> the optical power in the lattice beams is controlled in two stages . as a first stage </S>",
    "<S> , we use a low - bandwidth , high - dynamic - range actuator built from a z - cut birefringent quartz plate attached to a galvo motor . </S>",
    "<S> the quartz plate acts as a variable waveplate ( berek compensator ) and in combination with a polarizer becomes a variable attenuator with a dynamic range of @xmath71 over @xmath72 of rotation .    for the second stage of intensity stabilization </S>",
    "<S> , we use a large - active - area acousto - optical modulator ( aom , crystal technology 3080 - 197 ) as the actuator . thermal effects in the @xmath73 aom crystal can also result in pointing drifts on slow time scales . since the optical lattices are focused to @xmath31 waists at the position of the atoms , such pointing noise would cause position fluctuations of the trap center . to ameliorate these effects , the lattice beams are focused through the aom crystal by adjusting the distance between the fiber tip and the air - spaced fused silica collimator ( optosigma 027 - 0510 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we detect the optical power on two independent , shot - noise - limited transimpedance amplifiers using @xmath20 enhanced ingaas photodiodes ( pd , hamamatsu g8370 - 01 ) with gain just small enough to cover bandwidths up to @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the detected photovoltages are then used as the input to two independent servo loops .    for optical powers above @xmath47 , we do not require fast control over the lattice depth but require that the laser intensity is as passively stable as possible . in this regime , we feed back on the angular rotation of the quartz plate using a slow digital feedback loop . the low - bandwidth ( small - signal @xmath75 point @xmath76 ) </S>",
    "<S> actuator ensures that we can not write noise onto the laser at frequencies comparable to the trap frequencies .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : rin](b ) , we show laser intensity power spectral densities for the @xmath24 lattice and seed lasers . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra are normalized to the dc power and are commonly referred to as relative intensity - noise ( rin ) spectra ( see appendix  [ sec : rin - measurements ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the prominent relaxation oscillation peak in the seed laser spectrum becomes well - suppressed when engaging the built - in intensity - noise eater . after seeding the fiber amplifiers , </S>",
    "<S> the intensity stability is degraded by @xmath77 for fourier frequencies below @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> noise spikes from the switching power supplies driving the fiber amplifier pump diodes can be strongly suppressed by low - pass filtering the power supplies ( mpe ds26387 ) . </S>",
    "<S> acoustic pointing noise on the fiber tip from power - supply fans is suppressed by removing the power supplies from the amplifier enclosure .    for optical powers below @xmath48 , we use analog feedback on the rf amplitude driving the aom with an rf mixer and limit the servo s bandwidth by inserting a steep low - pass filter at @xmath79 ( lpf - b0r5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bandwidth limitation ensures that no electronic noise gets written onto the lattice amplitude at frequencies in the mhz regime . for small power setpoints , </S>",
    "<S> the aom servo has a nonlinear transfer function due to the use of a frequency mixer . </S>",
    "<S> this nonlinearity results in setpoint - dependent gain and reduced bandwidth for small setpoints , which is partially compensated by a schottky - diode - based linearization circuit in the controller . by conservatively tuning the loop , we are able to control the lattice depth over 2.5 orders of magnitude at the expense of slightly degraded noise spectra and lifetime for small lattice depths , as seen in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : heating ] . here , such a large dynamic range is useful to obtain the adiabatic band mapping images . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the low - power servo suppresses noise at frequencies relevant for quantum simulation of hubbard models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if required , the servo tuning can be reoptimized for even longer lifetimes for lattice depths of interest .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> we have demonstrated stable trapping of @xmath7 atoms in the radial ground band of @xmath20 optical lattices spanning 2.5 orders of magnitude in trap depth . </S>",
    "<S> we measure ground band populations with sensitivity down to @xmath80 atoms and the @xmath3 lifetime @xmath81 in the ground band can exceed one minute for deep lattices and is longer than @xmath82 ( @xmath83 ) for all lattice depths above @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> these heating rates are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than in ion traps with comparable trap frequencies  @xcite , with smaller distances to the nearest surface ( @xmath34 here ) . in a three - dimensional optical lattice with mhz trap frequencies , </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate radial ground band lifetimes that are comparable with the longest trap lifetimes measured in optical dipole traps  @xcite and one - dimensional optical lattices  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the heating rates are well - explained by a rate equation model based on the measured intensity - noise spectra . </S>",
    "<S> these spectra can be further tailored by servo design for application in quantum simulation experiments with @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> optical traps with mhz frequencies enable ion - trap - like spectral addressability  @xcite , are compatible with proximity to surfaces , and may have applications in achieving strong coupling to high - quality - factor mechanical resonators  @xcite .    </S>",
