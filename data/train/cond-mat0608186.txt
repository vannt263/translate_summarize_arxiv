    "in a previous paper  @xcite ( referred to hereafter as i ) we have studied a symmetrical , semiconducting double quantum dot system , with interdot capacitive coupling in addition to the usual intradot coulomb interaction . employing the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) approach  @xcite , and focussing on the regime with two electrons on the double dot",
    ", a rich and diverse range of physical behaviour was shown to arise on increasing the ratio @xmath1 of interdot to intradot coupling strengths  @xcite .",
    "the system first evolves continuously from a spin - kondo state , where the dot spins are in essence separately quenched ( @xmath2 ) , to an @xmath0 kondo state with entangled charge and spin degrees of freedom arising at @xmath3 .",
    "this in turn precedes a rapid but smooth crossover to a charge - kondo state in which a charge - pseudospin is kondo quenched ; followed by the suppression of charge - pseudospin tunneling , a continuous collapse of the underlying low - energy kondo scale , and a kosterlitz - thouless quantum phase transition at a critical @xmath4 to a degenerate charge - ordered state , itself a non - fermi liquid with a @xmath5 residual entropy .",
    "our primary emphasis in i was on the structure , stability and flows between the underlying rg fixed points , on the overall phase diagram and evolution of the characteristic low - energy kondo scale arising for all @xmath6 in the strong coupling phase ; and on static physical properties such as spin- and charge - susceptibilities , including some exact results for associated wilson ratios . in the present paper by contrast",
    "we focus on dynamical properties of the system , specifically the @xmath7-dependence and @xmath8-evolution of local single - particle spectra , which at the fermi level in particular determine the ( @xmath9 ) linear differential conductance across one or other dot ( the interdot coupling is purely capacitive , so there is of course no transport through the pair of dots ) .    a number of theoretical issues are discussed in section  [ sec : theory ] .",
    "these relate in particular to the ` two - self - energy ' description that we show is required to describe the broken symmetry charge - ordered ( co ) phase , its connection both to the potential scattering inherent to the co phase and to the ` single ' self - energy of conventional field theory ; and hence insights into the non - fermi liquid character of the co phase .",
    "numerical results for dynamics are presented in section  [ sec : numresdyn ] , including the important issues of universality and scaling of the low - energy single - particle spectra throughout the strong coupling phase .",
    "we focus then on the local single - particle spectrum for dot @xmath10 , @xmath11 , with @xmath12 the fourier transform of the ( retarded ) single - particle propagator @xmath13 . in terms of the local spectrum ,",
    "the zero - bias differential conductance across dot @xmath10 at @xmath9 , here denoted by @xmath14 , is given by @xcite @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 respectively the current and voltage across the dot ( and @xmath18 the hybridization strength , as in i ) .",
    "the @xmath9 linear differential conductance thus probes the single - particle spectrum at the fermi level , @xmath19 ( and at finite , low bias voltage @xmath20 , @xmath21 provides an approximation to the conductance ) . more generally , from the discussion given in i , one might expect the @xmath7-dependence of @xmath22 to exhibit a rich evolution as the interdot interaction @xmath8 is progressively increased through the spin - kondo regime ( @xmath23 ) , across the @xmath0 point @xmath24 into the charge - kondo regime ; and then towards the quantum phase transition occurring at @xmath4 and into the broken symmetry charge ordered ( co ) phase .    to motivate subsequent discussion , we shown in figure  [ fig : specfermi ] nrg results for the linear differential conductance @xmath25 _ vs _ the interdot @xmath26 for a fixed intradot @xmath27 . as discussed further below ,",
    "the transition between the strong coupling ( sc ) and co phases ( here occurring at @xmath28 ) is clearly evident : throughout the sc phase the conductance is ` pinned ' at the unitarity limit of @xmath29 , while it drops discontinuously on entering the co phase and decreases montonically thereafter with increasing @xmath30 .",
    "nrg results for the zero - frequency spectral density @xmath31 , or equivalently the linear differential conductance @xmath32 , as a function of @xmath33 for fixed @xmath34 .",
    "the dotted line marks the phase boundary @xmath35 . ]      in considering single - particle dynamics a number of rather subtle issues arise , which as we show have important ramifications e.g.  in understanding the non - fermi liquid nature of the co phase .",
    "the first concerns the ` two - self - energy ' description that is required to describe the co phase .",
    "the sc phase is a fermi liquid state , adiabatically connected to the non - interacting limit @xmath36 and with kondo screening ensuring that the ground state is locally non - degenerate .",
    "as such the traditional ` single self - energy ' description , based ultimately on perturbation theory in the interaction , is appropriate ; where ( with @xmath37 ) @xmath12 is expressed as @xmath38}\\ ] ] in terms of the conventional self - energy @xmath39 ( @xmath40 with the imaginary part @xmath41 ) .",
    "the co phase by contrast is not adiabatically connected to the non - interacting limit ( and as such is a non - fermi liquid ) , as evident e.g.  from the phase diagram figure 4 of i , where the co phase arises for @xmath42 and the critical @xmath4 as a function of @xmath43 satisfies @xmath44 for all @xmath45 .",
    "this phase is of course characterised by charge symmetry - breaking , the ground state being _ doubly _ degenerate ( @xmath46 and @xmath47 occurring with equal weight in the fixed point hamiltonian , section 4.1 of i ) . for this reason , as is obvious from its lehmann representation , the local propagator in the co phase is of form @xmath48.\\ ] ] here @xmath49 , with corresponding spectral density @xmath50 , denotes the propagator obtained from one or other of the degenerate ground states @xmath51 or @xmath52 mentioned above .",
    "this in turn may be expressed as @xmath53}\\ ] ] in terms of a self - energy @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the two - self - energy ( tse ) description embodied in equations ( [ eq : tse1 ] , [ eq : tse2 ] ) is a necessity and not a luxury when considering the co phase ( although equation ( [ eq : sse ] ) may obviously still be used to _ define _ a single - self - energy in the co phase , as considered in section 2.3 below ) .",
    "if one sought for example to calculate @xmath12 diagrammatically in the co phase , one would construct self - energies from _ charge _ symmetry - broken mean - field propagators ( unrestricted hartree fock ) ; the double degeneracy of the mean - field saddle points ensuring that it is the @xmath54 and hence @xmath49 that are thereby calculated , with the full @xmath12 then obtained from ( [ eq : tse1 ] ) .",
    "notice also that , trivially , in a case where @xmath56 is independent of @xmath57 , the tse description reduces formally to the conventional single self - energy description of equation ( [ eq : sse ] ) .",
    "it thus encompasses the sc phase simply as a special case .",
    "+ we now consider the implications of a tse description , considering primarily the co phase .",
    "the first point to note here is that , at the fermi level @xmath19 , the imaginary part of the self - energies @xmath54 vanishes , @xmath58 for @xmath59 .",
    "this reflects the fact that the fixed point hamiltonian for the co phase , section 4.1 of i , is characterised purely by potential scattering of the conduction electrons ( a point pursued in section 2.2 below ) .",
    "it can also be shown by considering the diagrams for @xmath54 constructed from charge symmetry - broken mean - field propagators . from equations ( [ eq :",
    "tse2 ] , [ eq : imsig ] ) it follows directly that the fermi level spectral density is given by @xmath60^{2 } + 1}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 denotes the ` renormalized level ' @xmath62 ( satisfying the obvious ` left / right ' symmetry @xmath63 with @xmath64 or @xmath65 for @xmath51 or @xmath52 respectively ) ; and such that the linear differential conductance @xmath66 this result may be recast equivalently in terms of the conduction electron phase shift @xmath67 , where @xmath68 with @xmath69 the conduction electron t - matrix . using equations ( [ eq : tse2 ] , [ eq : imsig ] ) gives @xmath70 and hence @xmath71 , i.e.@xmath72 for the linear differential conductance .",
    "the considerations above relating the fermi level spectrum to the renormalized levels and/or phase shifts are quite general . for the particular case of particle - hole symmetry ( @xmath73 , for which the explicit nrg calculations we show here are performed ) one has the additional , intuitively obvious reflection symmetry about the fermi level , @xmath74 . for the self - energies this corresponds to @xmath75 and @xmath76.\\ ] ] the renormalized levels ( equation ( [ eq : renormlevel ] ) ) thus satisfy @xmath77 implying equal and opposite scattering phase shifts , @xmath78 ( as noted in section 4.1 of i ) , such that the linear differential conductance @xmath79 .    as already noted the sc phase",
    "is recovered simply as a limit of the above analysis , with @xmath80 independent of @xmath57 . at particle - hole symmetry in this case ,",
    "equations ( [ eq : renormlevel ] , [ eq : phsymm ] ) show that the renormalized level _ vanishes _ by symmetry ( corresponding to a phase shift @xmath81 ) , and hence from equations ( [ eq : dialpha ] ) or ( [ eq : phsymm ] ) that @xmath82  the unitarity limit , seen clearly in the nrg results of figure  [ fig : specfermi ] for @xmath23 in the sc phase .",
    "we now relate the above results for single - particle dynamics at the fermi level to potential scattering . to this end",
    "consider the hamiltonian @xmath83 in which potential scattering is operative in conduction channel @xmath10 ( with strength @xmath84 ) , and for which the conduction electron t - matrix @xmath85 is readily calculated  @xcite .",
    "equating the resultant @xmath86 to @xmath87 considered above , one finds that ( a ) @xmath88 , i.e.  equation ( [ eq : imsig ] ) is recovered ; and ( b ) that the renormalized level @xmath61 is related to the scattering strength by @xmath89 ( with @xmath90 as usual the conduction band density of states ) .    equation ( [ eq : ps ] ) is in essence the fixed point hamiltonian for the co phase .",
    "more precisely , referring to equation ( 4.2 ) of i and noting that @xmath91 , the fixed point hamiltonian is of form @xmath92 ( both channels are of course involved ) ; with @xmath93 for the particle - hole symmetric case considered explicitly , where the dot charges @xmath94 or @xmath95 correspond respectively to the broken symmetry states we have denoted by @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "hence , considering explicitly the @xmath96 channel , @xmath97 with corresponding phase shifts @xmath98 , such that from equation ( [ eq : ldcphaseshifts ] ) the linear conductance is given by @xmath99 in terms of the potential scattering strength @xmath100 ( and is obviously independent of whether @xmath101 or @xmath102 is considered ) .",
    "it is straightforward to relate @xmath100 in turn to the potential scattering coupling constant @xmath103 that enters the @xmath104-discretized nrg hamiltonian for the co fixed point ( equation ( 4.3 ) of i ) : specifically , @xmath105/[2\\ln\\lambda ] ) \\tilde{k}$ ] .",
    "since @xmath103 itself is directly determined numerically in the nrg calculations , the linear conductance can thus either be determined this way from equation ( [ eq : ldcfrac ] ) , or as the @xmath19 limit of the single - particle spectrum @xmath22 ( determined via the standard nrg method  @xcite reprised at the beginning of section 3 ) . in practice",
    "we find the two methods to be in very good numerical agreement .",
    "as detailed in section 4.1 of i the co phase corresponds to a _ line _ of fixed points , one for each @xmath42 .",
    "the critical endpoint , occurring at @xmath106 on the co side of the transition , corresponds to a critical @xmath107 given by equation ( 4.8 ) of i , and thus to a critical @xmath108 $ ] . from equation ( [ eq : ldcfrac ] ) the differential conductance @xmath32 , which is unity throughout the sc phase for @xmath6 , thus drops abruptly at the transition to a value of @xmath109 at @xmath110  @xcite ; as seen clearly in the nrg results of figure  [ fig : specfermi ] .",
    "this discontinuous drop in the differential conductance as the transition is crossed appears to be a rather general signature of a kosterlitz - thouless quantum phase transition , it being found also for a multi - level small dot close to a singlet - triplet degeneracy point  @xcite and for a pair of ising - coupled kondo impurities , onto which maps the problem of spinless , capacitively coupled metallic islands close to the degeneracy point between @xmath111- and @xmath112-electron states  @xcite .",
    "we also add that while the existence of an abrupt drop in the differential conductance as the transition is crossed is not specific to the particle - hole symmetric case shown in figure  [ fig : specfermi ] , the magnitude of the discontinuity is , reflecting the fact that deviation from particle - hole symmetry generates additional potential scattering of the _ same _ sign on the two leads .",
    "the generic form for the linear conductance follows from equations ( [ eq : dialpha ] , [ eq : ldc1 ] , [ eq : wibbly ] ) as @xmath113 with the @xmath84 of form ( again for @xmath114 explicitly ) @xmath115 and @xmath116 , where @xmath117 represents the additional potential scattering common to each channel that vanishes only at particle - hole symmetry .      the conventional description of single - particle dynamics centres on the usual single self - energy @xmath118 , defined by equation ( [ eq : sse ] ) ( and the dyson equation implicit therein ) .",
    "the analysis above has however been couched in terms of a tse description , so the obvious question arises : what are the implications for @xmath118 ?",
    "the general relation between @xmath118 and the two self - energies @xmath54 follows simply from direct comparison of equations ( [ eq : sse ] ) with ( [ eq : tse1 ] , [ eq : tse2 ] ) , and is given by @xmath119 ~~ + ~~ \\frac{[\\case{1}{2}(\\tilde{\\sigma}_{ia}(\\omega ) - \\tilde{\\sigma}_{ib}(\\omega))]^{2}}{\\omega^{+ } + i\\gamma - [ \\epsilon + \\case{1}{2}(\\tilde{\\sigma}_{ia}(\\omega ) + \\tilde{\\sigma}_{ib}(\\omega))]}.\\ ] ] since @xmath120 ( equation ( [ eq : imsig ] ) ) , the imaginary part of the single self - energy at the fermi level follows from equation ( [ eq : ssetse ] ) as @xmath121^{2}\\gamma}{[\\epsilon_{ia}+\\epsilon_{ib}]^{2 } + 4\\gamma^{2}}\\ ] ] in terms of the renormalized levels @xmath61 , equation ( [ eq : renormlevel ] ) . for the sc phase ,",
    "where @xmath122 generically ( and @xmath123 at particle - hole symmetry ) , equation ( [ eq : ssefl ] ) gives @xmath124  just as required for a fermi liquid state ( @xmath125 as @xmath126 ) .",
    "single - particle spectra on ` high ' frequency scales : @xmath134 _ vs _",
    "@xmath135 for @xmath136 ( dotted line ) , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( solid lines , top to bottom ) with a fixed @xmath34 . ]",
    "we now consider nrg results for the full frequency dependence of the local dynamics , analysing spectra ( for a range of bare parameters ) on both high and low frequency scales , and in particular ( section  [ sec : uniscale ] ) extracting the universal scaling behaviour in the sc phase . the single - particle spectrum at finite-@xmath7 is obtained using the standard method @xcite",
    " a set of poles corresponding to the single - particle excitations are calculated from the sequence of nrg iterations , and these are subsequently broadened on a logarithmic scale to compensate for the initial logarithmic discretization of the hamiltonian and recover the continuum .",
    "we begin by considering briefly the evolution of single - particle dynamics on non - universal ` high ' energy scales  in particular the hubbard satellites  upon progressively increasing the interdot interaction @xmath8 from the limit @xmath141 where the dots are uncoupled .",
    "figure  [ fig : hubbsat ] shows @xmath142 versus @xmath135 for a fixed @xmath34 and @xmath136 ( dotted line ) , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 ( solid lines , top to bottom at @xmath143 ) . for all @xmath144 , the hubbard satellites are seen to be centred at approximately the same frequency , whereas for @xmath145 the positions of the satellites become @xmath33-dependent .",
    "it is straightforward to explain this behaviour by recourse to the atomic limit @xmath146 . for @xmath147 ,",
    "the atomic limit ground state is @xmath148 ( see equation ( 2.3 ) of i ) .",
    "this connects via single - particle excitations ( for e.g.  the left dot ) to @xmath149 and @xmath150 which , regardless of @xmath8 , are both an energy @xmath151 higher than the ground state .",
    "the atomic limit single - particle spectra thus exhibit hubbard satellites ( poles in this case ) at @xmath152 , independently of @xmath8 , which is the essential origin of the behaviour seen in figure  [ fig : hubbsat ] for @xmath23 .",
    "for @xmath153 by contrast , the atomic limit ground state is @xmath95/@xmath47 .",
    "the corresponding excited states accessible under single - particle excitations , @xmath154 and @xmath155 , are now an energy @xmath156 higher and thus become increasingly separated from the ground states as @xmath33 is raised ; generating @xmath8-dependent hubbard satellites at @xmath157 , as again seen in figure  [ fig : hubbsat ] . + before considering dynamics on the key low - energy scales , we make a general remark .",
    "nrg spectra may of course be calculated from either the even or the odd set of iterations ( fixed points are inexorably fixed points of the _ square _ of the rg transformation  @xcite ) ; and the same spectrum @xmath22 naturally results in either case . for the co phase arising for @xmath42 the nrg ground state",
    "is as one would expect doubly degenerate , regardless of whether even or odd iterations are considered .",
    "the two - self - energy description considered above is thus ubiquitous in this case . for @xmath6 in the sc phase by contrast there is an important difference between even-@xmath111 and odd-@xmath111 iterations , just as found in  @xcite for the single - impurity anderson model . in the even-@xmath111 case",
    "the nrg ground state is always ( for any iteration ) non - degenerate , for which reason an effective single - self - energy description of dynamics obviously arises .",
    "but for the odd-@xmath111 iterations the nrg ground state is always found to be doubly degenerate ( and with ` overlap ' on the dots ) .",
    "this leads directly to an inherent two - self - energy description of local dynamics , even in this non - symmetry - broken sc phase .",
    "we emphasise again that , whether even or odd iterations are considered , the resultant @xmath22 obtained from the nrg calculations is the same .",
    "but the key point is that a two - self - energy description of dynamics , which is a necessity in describing the broken symmetry co phase , is equally applicable in describing the sc phase ; a point not widely appreciated , but one which also underlies the local moment approach to correlated electron systems  @xcite .",
    "the situation sketched here is directly parallel to that detailed in  @xcite , to which the reader is referred for further discussion .",
    "we now consider dynamics on the low - energy scales characteristic of the kondo resonance that arises in the sc phase .",
    "for convenience we shall analyse the two regions @xmath158 and @xmath159 separately . the former displays the crossover from @xmath160 to @xmath0 behaviour on increasing @xmath33 towards the @xmath0 point @xmath24 ,",
    "whereas in the latter region we show how the kondo resonance is destroyed as @xmath33 moves through the phase transition . throughout the sc phase the fermi level spectrum is ( as above ) pinned at the unitarity limit , @xmath161 ; and we note that this behaviour is accurately captured by the numerics on employing the standard @xmath162-factor ( @xmath163 )  @xcite that corrects for the finite-@xmath104 discretization inherent to the nrg .    figure  [ fig : specincup](a )     evolution of the single particle spectrum @xmath164 vs. @xmath135 with increasing @xmath33 at fixed @xmath34 .",
    "( a ) shows the crossover from @xmath160 to @xmath0 physics , @xmath136 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath138 ( from bottom to top ) ; while ( b ) for @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 ( from top to bottom ) shows the destruction of the kondo resonance as the phase transition occurring at @xmath28 is crossed . ]",
    "thus shows @xmath164 versus @xmath135 for a fixed , strongly correlated @xmath34 , with increasing @xmath136 , @xmath165 , @xmath166 and @xmath138 ( in order of increasing resonance width ) .",
    "as expected from the thermodynamic results discussed in i , the @xmath160 physics of @xmath136 is found to persist with increasing @xmath33 until one gets very close to the @xmath0 point .",
    "for @xmath172 for example , the functional form of the kondo resonance is essentially the same as for @xmath136 , the only difference being that its width is increased slightly in proportion to the kondo temperature @xmath173 ( the evolution of @xmath173 itself being shown explicitly in figure 5 of i ) .",
    "as @xmath8 moves closer to @xmath43 however , the lm@xmath174 fixed point begins to play an increasingly important rle in shaping the low - frequency form of the spectrum .",
    "this is evident in the case @xmath175 , where there is a distinct shoulder in the kondo resonance when @xmath135 is on the scale of the crossover from lm@xmath174to lm@xmath176 ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "we discuss this point in more detail when considering the scaling characteristics of the spectrum in ; for now we simply note that at frequencies below the crossover scale the spectrum is again of the same @xmath160 form as for @xmath136 , whereas on higher scales the tails of the resonance approach those of the @xmath178 @xmath0 spectrum which is also shown in the figure .",
    "figure  [ fig : specincup](b ) illustrates the situation on the other side of the @xmath0 point : we show @xmath164 versus @xmath135 , again for fixed @xmath34 but now with @xmath167 , @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 and @xmath171 , spanning as such the transition occurring at @xmath28 .",
    "as shown in figure 5 of i , with increasing @xmath30 the kondo scale @xmath173 in the sc phase now decreases exponentially rapidly ( following the kosterlitz - thouless form equation ( 6.3 ) of i ) , and ultimately vanishes at the critical @xmath179 .",
    "the vanishing of the low - energy kondo scale as the transition is approached is seen vividly in the behaviour of the kondo resonance .",
    "this narrows rapidly with increasing @xmath30 ( figure  [ fig : specincup]b for @xmath180 and @xmath169 ) , while maintaining the unitarity limit @xmath181 .",
    "the kondo resonance collapses ` on the spot ' at @xmath182 , and for @xmath183 in the co phase leaves only an incoherent continuum around the fermi level ( with @xmath184 ) .",
    "one of the most important results for the single - impurity anderson model is the universality of the kondo resonance , arising in the strongly correlated kondo regime ( @xmath185 ) when the frequency axis is rescaled in terms of the kondo scale @xmath173 . here ,",
    "we examine corresponding issues of universality for the dqd model in the different regimes of the sc phase .",
    "first recall briefly the scaling behaviour of the spectra @xmath134 for @xmath136 , where the single - impurity limit ( at particle - hole symmetry ) is recovered . for @xmath186 , spectra for different values of @xmath187 collapse onto a common form ( see e.g.  @xcite ) when the frequency axis is rescaled as @xmath188 , with _ no _ dependence on the ` bare ' parameters of the model .",
    "once this ` scaling spectrum ' is known , the spectrum for any particular @xmath187 can thus be determined on an absolute frequency scale simply from a knowledge of @xmath173 alone .",

    "the @xmath196 scaling spectrum pertains of course to the @xmath160 kondo model .",
    "one would clearly expect a similar scaling spectrum to exist at @xmath197 , in this case reflecting @xmath0 kondo physics .",
    "that this is indeed so is seen in the inset to figure  [ fig : scalspecsk ] , which shows @xmath164 versus @xmath188 for @xmath193 , @xmath140 and @xmath194 . from this",
    "the collapse onto a universal form is immediately apparent .",
    "of course , this @xmath0 scaling spectrum differs substantially from its @xmath160 counterpart , as shown in figure  [ fig : scalspecsk ] where the @xmath0 spectrum is plotted as the lower solid line .",
    "having shown distinct scaling behaviour at the @xmath160 and @xmath0 points , an obvious question arises : how do the scaling spectra evolve from @xmath160 to @xmath0 behaviour in the intervening region @xmath198 ? as mentioned in the discussion of section  [ sec : uprimespec ] , it is in fact the non - universal scale @xmath199 which controls this crossover ; and the magnitude of @xmath199 in relation to @xmath173 determines whether the scaling spectrum will be essentially that of @xmath136 , @xmath178 , or a combination of the two .",
    "for example , if @xmath33 is not exponentially close to @xmath187 , the ratio @xmath200 will be very large ( recall that @xmath201 is always exponentially small in strong coupling ) , the lm@xmath174 fixed point will thus have basically no influence on the low - frequency dynamics , and the spectrum should therefore collapse onto the @xmath160 scaling spectrum . similarly ,",
    "if @xmath202 , then one would expect the scaling spectrum to be essentially unchanged from the @xmath0 spectrum on all but possibly the lowest frequency scales ( and even here the friedel sum rule guarantees that @xmath203 as @xmath204 throughout the sc phase ) .",
    "when @xmath205 however , we do expect to see qualitatively different scaling spectra : here the crossover from @xmath160 to @xmath0 occurs on a scale of order @xmath173 itself , and we would thus expect the spectra to show characteristics of both regimes .",
    "our numerical results agree with the arguments given above . for @xmath206 and frequencies in the range shown in figure  [ fig : scalspecsk ] ,",
    "the single particle spectra plotted as a function of @xmath188 collapse essentially perfectly onto the @xmath141 @xmath160 scaling spectrum . for larger values of @xmath33",
    "however , the ratio @xmath207 moves into the frequency range under consideration and hence the spectra begin to show signs of @xmath0 tails .",
    "for example , the dotted lines in figure  [ fig : scalspecsk ] show @xmath164 versus @xmath188 for @xmath208 , @xmath191 and @xmath192 , from which it is clear that with increasing @xmath33 towards @xmath209 , the @xmath160 low - frequency behaviour holds over a progressively decreasing range of @xmath188 . for values of @xmath33",
    "much closer still to @xmath187 , the numerically obtained scaling spectra are virtually indistinguishable from that of the @xmath0 line @xmath24 .",

    "the scaling spectrum shows a distinct ` charge - kondo ' resonance , the tails of which tend not to zero as @xmath219 , but to the value @xmath220\\simeq 0.2 $ ] which is the zero - frequency value of the spectrum on entering the co phase ( section [ sec : potscat ] ) .    in the inset of ,",
    "we show further that this scaling spectrum is independent of the value of @xmath187 ( for strong - coupling @xmath186 ) , the same spectrum being obtained close to the phase boundary for @xmath34 , @xmath139 and @xmath140 . for each @xmath217",
    ", the value of @xmath30 has been chosen sufficiently close to the phase boundary that the kondo scale @xmath201 is well described by its asymptotic kosterlitz - thouless form ( see e.g.  figure 5 of i ) ; the @xmath30s being chosen in practice such that @xmath221 .",
    "to summarise , we have shown that the scaling behaviour of the spectra throughout the sc phase can for the most part be understood quite simply in terms of the three scaling spectra obtained in the limits @xmath136 , @xmath178 and @xmath222 .",
    "the @xmath136 scaling spectrum in fact captures the behaviour in the vast majority of the phase , being the appropriate description for all @xmath223 .",
    "as one moves closer to the @xmath0 line , the spectra at low - frequencies cross over to the @xmath0 scaling spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : scalspecsk ] , and then beyond @xmath178 the spectra rapidly collapses onto the charge - kondo scaling spectrum shown in figure  [ fig : scalspecck ] .",
    "finally , we comment briefly on symmetry breaking perturbations which destroy the stability of the co fixed point",
    ". particle - hole asymmetry does not of course fall into this category .",
    "as we have emphasised several times here and in i the particle - hole symmetric case ( @xmath224 ) is entirely representative , and the essential physics robust to departure from it .",
    "however the model we have considered is ` left / right ' symmetric : equivalent dots ( e.g.  @xmath225 ) , and equivalent coupling to the conduction channels / leads ( @xmath226 ) .",
    "if @xmath227 symmetry is broken it is readily shown that while the sc fixed point remains stable , additional relevant perturbations arise for the co fixed point and hence render it unstable .",
    "flows in the vicinity of the co fixed point thus ultimately flow away from it under renormalization , and cross over instead to the sc fixed point .",
    "since the quantum phase transition between the sc and co phases is strictly destroyed by breaking @xmath227 symmetry , the question arises : do visible remnants of the transition nonetheless remain ?",
    "indeed they do .",
    "to illustrate this we consider explicitly the case of detuning the dot levels e.g.  by applying a different gate voltage to each dot , taking @xmath228 ( with @xmath229 as usual ) .",
    "here one expects intuitively that the crossover scale for flows away from the co fixed point will be determined by @xmath230 ; and that if @xmath230 is not large compared to the @xmath0 scale @xmath231 , then the erstwhile transition will be ` smeared out ' but still in essence visible as a clear crossover .",
    "that this is so is illustrated in figure 6 , where we show nrg results for the differential conductance @xmath232 _ vs _",
    "@xmath30 for three different @xmath230 , viz @xmath233 and @xmath234 ( with @xmath235 the @xmath236 @xmath0 scale for @xmath237 ) .",
    "the pristine transition occurring for @xmath237 is as anticipated smeared out , on a scale determined by @xmath230 ; albeit remaining clearly visible ( note that the lowest @xmath30 shown in figure 6 is @xmath238 ) , and as such robust in an obvious sense .",
    "linear differential conductance @xmath239 _ vs _ @xmath30 for a fixed @xmath240 and @xmath241 ( dotted line ) , @xmath242 ( dashed ) and @xmath234 ( solid ) .",
