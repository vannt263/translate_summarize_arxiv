    "communication networks such as the internet , world - wide - web and pear - to - pear networks play an important role in modern society .",
    "dynamical properties of these systems have attracted tremendous interests and devotion among not only engineering but also physics communities @xcite .",
    "the ultimate goal of studying these large communication networks is to control the increasing traffic congestion and improve the efficiency of information transportation .",
    "many recent studies have focused on the efficiency improvement of communication networks which is usually considered from two aspects : one is modifying the underlying network structure @xcite and the other is developing better routing strategies @xcite . comparing with the former , the latter is preferable with respect to the high cost of changing underlying structure . in traffic systems ,",
    "the structure of the underlying network play an significant role in the traffic dynamics . in order to develop practical routing strategies , understanding the effect of network on the traffic dynamics",
    "is a central problem .    since the surprising discovery of scale - free property of real world networks by barabi and albert @xcite , it is worthwhile to investigate the traffic dynamics on the scale - free networks instead of random and regular networks .",
    "how the traffic dynamics are influenced by many kinds of structures , such as web - graph @xcite , hierarchical trees @xcite and barabsi - albert network @xcite , has been extensively investigated .",
    "a variety of empirically observed dynamical behaviors have been reproduced by such traffic models , including @xmath0-like noise of load series , phase transition from free flow state to congestion , power - law scaling correlation between flux and the relevant variance and cascading @xcite . moreover ,",
    "some previous work pointed out that traffic processes taking place on the networks do also remarkably affect the evolution of the underlying structure @xcite . to model traffic dynamics on networks , especially for the internet and www , data - packet generating rate together with their randomly selected source and destinations are in introduced by previous work @xcite .",
    "some models assume that packets are routed along shortest paths from origins to destinations @xcite .",
    "however , due to the difficulty in searching and storing shortest paths between any pair of nodes of large networks , the routing strategies based on local topological information have been proposed for better mimicking real traffic systems and for more widely potential application , such as pear - to - pear networks @xcite .    among previous studies ,",
    "the efficiency of the communication networks has received much attention for its practical importance @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of the traffic system can be reflected by capacity and communication velocity of the system .",
    "the capacity is measured by the onset of phase transition from free flow to congestion , which has been investigated in several works @xcite .",
    "the phase transition points can be denoted by the maximal packet generating rate , under which the system is in the free flow state and no congestion occurs , so that the system can maintain it normal and efficient functioning .",
    "the communication velocity is measured by the average packet travel time .",
    "we note that these two quantities are not equivalent for estimating the efficiency , but even contradictory to each other .",
    "take scale - free networks for example .",
    "scale - free networks possess shorter average path length in contrast with random and regular networks , which is attributed to the existence of hub nodes .",
    "thus , data packets can transmit much faster in the scale - free networks .",
    "however , suppose that too much data flow passes through those hub nodes , it will lead to the congestion at those nodes and decrease the network capacity .",
    "aiming to solve the conflict between the network capacity and the communication speed , we propose a new routing strategy adopting in the scale - free networks based on local static and dynamic information , which are the local structure and traffic flux , respectively . comparing with the strategy based on exclusive local static information @xcite ,",
    "both the capacity of the networks and the average packet travel time are considerably improved by adopting the mixing strategy .",
    "the effects of the new strategy on the efficiency of the scale - free traffic system are discussed in detail .",
    "the introduced strategy may has potential application in pear - to - pear networks .    the paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we describe the model rules and the relevant definitions in detail . in sec .",
    "iii we demonstrate the simulation results and the discussion . in the last section , the present work is concluded .",
    "barabsi - albert model is the simplest and a well - known model which can generate networks with power - law degree distribution @xmath1 , where @xmath2 . without losing generality we construct the network structure by following the same method used in ref .",
    "@xcite : starting from @xmath3 fully connected nodes , a new node with @xmath3 edges is added to the existing graph at each time step according to preferential attachment , i.e. , the probability @xmath4 of being connected to the existing node @xmath5 is proportional to the degree @xmath6",
    ". then we model the traffic of packets on the given graph . at each time step , there are @xmath7 packets generated in the system , with randomly selected sources and destinations .",
    "we treat all the nodes as both hosts and routers @xcite and assume that each node can deliver at most @xmath8 packets per time step towards their destinations .",
    "all the nodes perform a parallel local search among their immediate neighbors .",
    "if a packet s destination is found within the searched area of node @xmath9 , i.e. the immediate neighbors of @xmath9 , the packets will be delivered from @xmath9 directly to its target and then removed from the system .",
    "otherwise , the probability of a neighbor node @xmath5 , to which the packet will be delivered is as follows : @xmath10 where , the sum runs over the immediate neighbors of the node @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath6 is the degree of node @xmath5 and @xmath11 is the number of packets in the queue of @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath12 is an introduced tunable parameter . @xmath6 and @xmath11 are the so - called static and dynamic information , respectively . adding one to @xmath11 is to guarantee the nodes without packets have probability to receive packets . during the evolution of the system ,",
    "fifo ( first - in first - out ) rule is applied and each packet has no memory of previous steps . under the control of the routing strategy , all packets perform a biased random - walk like move .",
    "all the simulations are performed with choosing @xmath13 .    to implement our strategy",
    ", each node should know the traffic load of its neighbors , which can be implemented by using the _ keep - alive _ messages that routers ( nodes ) continuously exchange real - time information with their peers @xcite .",
    "however , taking into account the information transmission cost , the exchanged information may be updated every few second between neighbors .",
    "therefore , we study the effect of transmission delay on the traffic dynamics .",
    "the delay in our model is defined as the number of time steps ( period ) of receiving updating information from neighbors .",
    "[ 0.80 ] ( color online ) .",
    "the order parameter @xmath14 as a function of generating rate @xmath7 for different value of parameter @xmath12 .",
    "other parameters are @xmath15 , @xmath13 and @xmath16.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in order to characterize the network capacity , we use the order parameter presented in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is defined as the number of packets within the network at time @xmath19 .",
    "@xmath20 with @xmath21 indicates average over time windows of width @xmath22 .",
    "the order parameter represents the ratio between the outflow and the inflow of packets calculated over long enough period . in the free flow state , due to the balance",
    "of created and removed packets , the load does not depend on time , which brings a steady state .",
    "thus when time tends to be unlimited , @xmath14 is about zero .",
    "otherwise , when @xmath7 exceeds a critical value @xmath23 , the packets will continuously pile up within the network , which destroys the stead state .",
    "thus , the quantities of packets within the system will be a function of time , which makes @xmath14 a constant more than zero .",
    "therefore , a sudden increment of @xmath14 from zero to nonzero characterizes the onset of the phase transition from free flow state to congestion , and the network capacity can be measured by the maximal generating rate @xmath23 at the phase transition point .",
    "[ 0.80 ] ( color online ) . the network capacity @xmath23 versus parameter @xmath12 for different time delay and for different network size @xmath24 .",
    "other parameter is @xmath13.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "as mentioned above , the efficiency of the system is reflected by both the network capacity and the communication velocity .",
    "we first investigate the order parameter @xmath14 as a function of generating rate @xmath7 for different model parameter @xmath12 , as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "one can find that for each @xmath12 , when @xmath7 is less than a specific value @xmath23 , @xmath14 is zero ; it suddenly increases when @xmath7 is slightly larger than @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , in this figure , different @xmath12 corresponds to different @xmath23 , thus we investigate the network capacity @xmath23 depending on @xmath12 for finding the optimal value of parameter @xmath12 .",
    "figure 2 shows that in the case of no time delay , the network capacity is considerably enhanced by reducing @xmath12 , and when @xmath12 is less than a specific value , approximately @xmath25 , the capacity reaches an upper limit .",
    "the dynamic information @xmath11 represents the amount of traffic flux of node @xmath5 .",
    "the effect of decreasing @xmath12 is to allow packets to circumvent the nodes with heavier traffic burden and alleviate the congestion on those nodes . while for the case of only adopting local topology information ( static strategy ) @xcite , the maximal network capacity is @xmath26 with choosing @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , the higher maximal capacity by adopting the new strategy indicates that the dynamic information is a better reflection of congestion than the static one .",
    "moreover , the capacity with time delay are also studied , as shown in fig .",
    "when the delay is not long , @xmath23 is slightly reduced as increasing the delay , and the onset of the upper limit is still at @xmath27 . however , for the long delay , such as @xmath28 , it has remarkable influence on the network capacity .",
    "there exists a maximal value of @xmath23 as the point of @xmath29 instead of reaching upper limit and the network capacity is reduced",
    ". the feedback information with long period can not well reflect the real circumstance of the neighbor nodes , which leads to the instabilities in the system , so that the capacity decreases .",
    "furthermore , we perform simulations with larger network size , @xmath30 , as exhibited in fig .",
    "the curve of @xmath23 vs @xmath12 displays the same tendency with the cases of @xmath16 .",
    "it is the longer average shortest path length that results in the decrease of network capacity comparing with the cases of @xmath16 .",

    "@xmath32 corresponds to the optimal value of static strategy .",
    "@xmath12 is the parameter of the mixing strategy .",
    "the inset is the average distances travelled by packets @xmath33 as a function of @xmath7 for different @xmath12 .",
    "the network size @xmath16 , node delivering ability @xmath13.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the communication velocity of the system can be estimated by the mean travel time of the packets from their origins to destinations over a long period .",
    "the mean travel time @xmath31 vs creating rate @xmath7 for different parameter @xmath12 are demonstrated in fig .",
    "we also compare the behavior of @xmath31 by adopting static strategy @xcite with adopting the new one upon the identical network structure , where @xmath32 corresponds to the optimal parameter value of the static strategy as shown in fig .",
    "all the simulations are performed within the steady state , in which @xmath31 is independent of time step . while if the system enters the jammed state , @xmath34 will increase as time grows , ultimately , it will be prone to be unlimited due to packets continuous accumulation in the system . by adopting the static strategy",
    ", @xmath31 is approximately independent of @xmath7 , which is because that the static routing algorithm is based on exclusive topological information .",
    "although the static strategy strongly improves the network capacity , it ignores the importance of hub nodes i.e. greatly reducing the diameter of the network .",
    "in contrast with the static strategy , the new strategy by integrating the local static and dynamic information can not only considerably enhance the network capacity but also make the hub nodes efficiently utilized .",
    "one can see in fig .",
    "3 , when @xmath7 is not too large , @xmath31 by adopting the new strategy for all @xmath12 is much shorter than that by adopting static strategy . the advantages of using the new strategy can be explained from eq .",
    "1 . for very small @xmath7 , few packets accumulate in the queue , thus @xmath35 , which is consistent with the search algorithm proposed in ref .",
    "the high efficiency of this algorithm for searching target nodes has been demonstrated by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "hence , it is the shorter average distances travelled by packets @xmath33 that induces the shorter @xmath34 in the free flow state , which can be seen in the inset of fig .",
    "3 , where @xmath33 is nearly the same with @xmath36 for identical value of @xmath12 .",
    "when increasing @xmath7 , packets start to accumulate on the large degree nodes , the new strategy can automatically decrease the probability of packets delivered to those hub nodes according to the dynamic information .",
    "then , when @xmath7 approaches to the @xmath23 , packets are routed by the mixing strategy to circumvent those hub nodes , which become the bottleneck of the system . therefore , near the phase transition point , @xmath31 shows the same value by adopting two different strategies . combing the results that @xmath27 is not only the onset of upper limit of the network capacity but also corresponds to the shortest @xmath31 in the case of maximal network capacity",
    ", we can conclude that @xmath27 is the optimal choice .",

    "@xmath12 is the tunable parameter of the new strategy .",
    "the network size @xmath16 , @xmath13.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we further investigate the behavior of traffic load influenced by the routing strategy .",
    "3 displays the average load @xmath37 as a function of @xmath7 for two strategies with different parameters . for static strategy with the optimal parameter , load is a linear function of @xmath7 .",
    "as to the new strategy , for a wide range of @xmath7 , the load adopting the new strategy is lower than that by adopting the static one .",
    "when @xmath7 approaches the critical value @xmath23 , the load with the new strategy turns to be larger .",
    "we also observe that by choosing @xmath27 , the system affords the lowest traffic load among the whole range of @xmath7 , which also demonstrates that @xmath27 is the optimal choice .",
    "actually , there exists some relationship between mean packets travel time and average load . according to the little s law @xcite in the queueing theory , one can easily obtain @xmath38 .",
    "note that this result is only satisfied in the steady state due to the balance between created and removed nodes .    to give a detailed insight into the effect of the new strategy",
    ", we investigate the queue length of a node @xmath39 as a function of its degree @xmath40 with selecting the optimal parameter for different @xmath7 .",
    "the queue length of a node is defined as the number of packets in the queue of that node .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "4 . one can see that when @xmath7 is not large , @xmath39 vs @xmath40 shows power law properties and the slope for different @xmath7 is the same .",
    "these behaviors are attributed to the domination of static information . in eq .",
    "1 , small @xmath7 leads to the small @xmath11 , and the forwarding probability is mainly determined by the node degree i.e. static information .",
    "therefore , @xmath39 versus @xmath40 demonstrates universal scaling property @xcite . for medium value of @xmath7 , such as @xmath41 ,",

    "when @xmath7 approaches to the phase transition point @xmath23 , we can see in fig .",

    "we have proposed a new routing strategy by integrating local static and dynamic information .",
    "the advantages of this strategy for delivering data packets on scale - free networks have been demonstrated from two aspects of network capacity and mean packets travel time .",
    "the short mean packets travel time is mainly due to the sufficient use of hub nodes .",
    "the large network capacity is caused by the utilization of dynamic information which reflects the traffic burden on nodes .",
    "the present study indicates that the large degree nodes play an important role in packets delivery .",
    "the packets can find their targets with higher probability if they pass by the large degree nodes , which results in shorter average travel time by packets .",
    "however , the large degree nodes are also easily congested if large amount of packets are prone to pass through them .",
    "the introduced strategy can make the large degree nodes fully used when packet creating rate is low , and also allow packets to bypass those nodes when they afford heavy traffic burden . thus the system s efficiency is greatly improved .",
