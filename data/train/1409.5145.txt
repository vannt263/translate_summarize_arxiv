    "a bright soliton is a localized intensity peak that maintains its shape , while traveling at a constant velocity in one dimension ( 1d ) , due to a cancellation of nonlinear attraction and dispersive effects @xcite .",
    "solitons have been observed in water waves , nonlinear optics , and bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) etc . among others . in physical three - dimensional ( 3d ) world , quasi - one - dimensional ( quasi-1d ) solitons are observed where a reduced ( integrated ) 1d density exhibit soliton - like property @xcite .",
    "experimentally , bright matter - wave solitons and soliton trains were created in a bec of @xmath6li @xcite and @xmath7rb atoms @xcite .",
    "however , due to collapse instability , 3d bec bright solitons are fragile and can accommodate only a small number of atoms @xcite .",
    "recent observation of becs of @xmath5dy @xcite , @xmath8er @xcite and @xmath9cr @xcite atoms with large magnetic dipole moments has opened new directions of research in bec solitons . in a dipolar bec , in addition to the quasi-1d solitons",
    "@xcite it is possible to have a quasi - two - dimensional ( quasi-2d ) soliton @xcite free to move in a plane with a constant velocity and trapped in the perpendicular direction .",
    "although , such a quasi-2d dipolar bec soliton has not been experimentally observed , this seems to be the only simplest example of an experimentally realizable quasi-2d soliton .",
    "dipolar bec solitons can be stabilized either by a harmonic or an optical - lattice trap in quasi-1d @xcite and quasi-2d @xcite configurations .",
    "more interestingly , one can have dipolar bec solitons for fully repulsive contact interaction @xcite .",
    "hence these dipolar solitons bound by long - range dipolar interaction could be robust and less vulnerable to collapse for a large number of atoms due to the repulsive contact interaction .",
    "the contact repulsion gives stability against collapse and dipolar attraction prevents the escape of the atoms from the soliton .",
    "the possibility of realizing a trapped bec in an excited ( non - ground ) state has been a topic of intense research @xcite .",
    "here we demonstrate the existence of stable excited quasi-2d dipolar bec solitons harmonically trapped in the @xmath0 direction capable of moving in the @xmath2 plane with a constant velocity with @xmath1 the polarization direction .",
    "they are stable and stationary excitations of the quasi-2d bright solitons .",
    "we consider three types of excitations of the solitons : lowest excitation for dynamics along ( i ) @xmath3 axis , ( ii ) @xmath1 axis , and ( iii ) both @xmath3 and @xmath1 axes . the wave function for the lowest @xmath3 ( @xmath1 ) excitation is antisymmetric in @xmath3 ( @xmath1 ) with a zero in the @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) plane .",
    "the symmetries of these states are quite similar to the excited states of a 3d trapped harmonic oscillator , the only difference is that in the case of the quasi-2d dipolar solitons there is no harmonic trap along @xmath3 and @xmath1 axes and the confinement in these directions is achieved solely by dipolar attraction .",
    "in addition to the normal excited quasi-2d dipolar bec soliton , we also considered a set - up where the sign of the dipolar interaction is reversed by a rotating orienting field @xcite . in",
    "this sign changed configuration , the dipolar interaction is repulsive along @xmath1 axis and attractive in the @xmath4 plane and an excited quasi-2d dipolar bec soliton can be realized by applying a harmonic trap along the @xmath1 axis",
    ". the stationary excited quasi-2d bright solitons were obtained by a imaginary - time propagation of the mean - field gross - pitaevskii ( gp ) equation in 3d .",
    "these stationary excited solitons can also be termed quasi-2d dipolar dark - in - bright solitons bearing resemblance with the quasi-1d dipolar dark - in - bright solitons studied recently @xcite .",
    "the quasi-1d dipolar dark - in - bright solitons were also established to be excitations of dipolar bright solitons @xcite .",
    "we also studied the dynamics of these quasi-2d solitons by real - time simulation using an effective 2d mean - field model .",
    "the stability of the excited quasi-2d dipolar solitons was established by studying the breathing oscillation of the system upon small perturbation over long time in real - time propagation .",
    "the head - on collision between two excited quasi-2d solitons is found to be quasi elastic at medium velocities of few mm / s .",
    "in such a collision , two excited solitons pass through each other without significant deformation .",
    "however , at lower velocities the collision becomes inelastic , as only the strictly 1d integrable solitons can have elastic collision at all velocities @xcite .",
    "we also demonstrate by real - time simulation in 2d the possibility of the creation of the excited quasi-2d solitons by phase imprinting @xcite a normal quasi-2d bright soliton with identical parameters with , for example , a phase difference of @xmath12 between the two parts of the bec wave function situated at @xmath13 and @xmath14 .    in sec .",

    "the domain of the appearance of the ground and excited states of the quasi-2d solitons is illustrated in a phase plot with realistic values of contact and dipolar interactions of @xmath5dy atoms exhibiting the maximum number of atoms in the quasi-2d soliton versus the scattering length .",
