    "<S> a simple example is that optical transitions in a solid , just like in an atom , involve matrix elements that depend on the symmetries of the underlying wavefunctions or orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> a deeper example is that the geometric or berry phase of bloch wavefunctions controls the electrical polarization and other properties . </S>",
    "<S> although the spontaneous polarization of solids was already of interest to the ancients , and the polarization of a finite distribution of charge density is easily understood , the proper computation of electrical polarization from a unit cell of an infinite crystal had to await the `` modern theory of polarization '' ,  @xcite which is now widely used in practical calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> the goal of the present work is to explain the quantitative connection between bulk nonlinear optical properties of a material , specifically the shift current piece of photocurrent linear in the intensity of applied light , and electrical polarization . </S>",

    "<S> the total polarization is gauge - dependent up to a quantized ambiguity ; in the simplest case of one spatial dimension , the polarization @xmath16 is defined only up to addition of an integer multiple of electron charge . </S>",

    "<S> the physical bulk polarization is defined as a difference with respect to an inversion - symmetric reference system which are adiabatically deformed with each other while keeping a fixed value of @xmath22 .    </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the ( gauge - invariant ) shift vector is directly related in many cases to ( gauge - dependent ) polarization differences between the valence and conduction band . </S>",
    "<S> the integral of the shift vector over the bz is equal to the polarization difference evaluated in a specific gauge : the optical transitions that are described by the shift vector can be viewed as fixing the relative gauge between valence and conduction bands , at least in the simplest case where such transitions are allowed at every @xmath9-point . </S>",
    "<S> hence the phase of the optical transition matrix element determines an `` optical gauge '' : @xmath15 is made constant via an appropriate gauge transformation , which is allowed as long as the optical transition takes place with @xmath23 . on the other hand , at the @xmath9 points satisfying @xmath24 , we fail to fix the relative phase between the two bands and can not adopt the optical gauge . </S>",
    "<S> we call such @xmath9-points `` optical zeros '' , and show that they are related to ambiguity of polarization up to polarization quanta . </S>",
    "<S> the connection between polarization and shift vector sketched above indicates that materials with significant polarization differences between bands ( minimized over gauge ambiguities ) must have significant shift vectors somewhere in the bz .    </S>",

    "<S> in addition , we adopt the periodic gauge  @xcite defined by @xmath27 where @xmath28 are bloch wavefunctions and @xmath29 a reciprocal lattice vector . in this case , all connections @xmath30 are periodic in the bz , i.e. , @xmath31 ( for details , see si  sec . </S>",

    "<S> the optical gauge is obtained by starting from any periodic gauge and performing a ( possibly large ) gauge transformation to it such that @xmath41 and @xmath42 . at optical zeros ( @xmath43 ) , the phase @xmath32 is not well - defined , and hence , as we show we have multiple values of @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the existence of optical zeros is physical and can not be removed by gauge transformations , which is related to a jump of polarization as we explain later .    </S>",
    "<S> the shift vector @xmath44 is usually assigned the meaning of a microscopic dipole formed by the photoexcited particle - hole , where @xmath44 corresponds to the shift of the electron wave packet formed at @xmath33 upon the optical transition between the two bands  @xcite , fig  [ fig : shift_vector_rm_model](a ) . </S>",

    "<S> since @xmath44 is related to the shift of wave packets , we can expect that an integral of @xmath44 over @xmath33 has a relationship to the difference of polarization of the two bands . </S>",

    "<S> [ eqn : int_shift_vector ] shows that the integral of the shift vector over the bz is proportional to the polarization difference between the conduction and valence bands up to an integer @xmath36 for an arbitrary choice of periodic gauge . </S>",

    "<S> in particular , eq .  [ eqn : shift_vec_pol_general ] shows that the polarization difference and locations of optical zeros ( that determine @xmath104 ) are important in understanding photovoltaic responses in the left hand side .    as an example , consider a simple extension of the rm model to two - dimensions . </S>",

    "<S> suppose that the staggered potential is modulated along @xmath105 but constant along @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to show that the electrical polarization is along @xmath105 and only transitions from bands @xmath108 and @xmath109 are allowed . </S>",

    "<S> _ discussion and conclusions_.- in the present study , we showed that the integral over the bz of the shift vector between two bands is , in the absence of interband optical zeros , equivalent to the polarization difference or distance between the centers of charge of the two bands modulo an integer quantum of polarization . </S>",
    "<S> if this integer can be chosen to be zero along a path in parameter space then it defines an optical gauge , and establishes direct relationship between shift vector and polarization . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss when and how this is possible by clarifying the role of the interband optical zeros where the off - diagonal connections vanishes . </S>",
    "<S> the vorticity of the optical zeros ( properly defined ) determines the jump in the gauge - invariant @xmath102 .    </S>",
    "<S> our results provide a microscopic explanation of the observed strong correlation between polarization and shift current in lower dimensional materials , e.g. , thin films of batio@xmath13 @xcite and single - layer monochalcogenides such as ges  @xcite . moreover , the right - hand side of eq .  </S>",
    "<S> [ eqn : shift_vec_pol_general ] is easier to evaluate than the left - hand side with with standard ab - initio methods and serves as an estimate of shift current generation . </S>",
