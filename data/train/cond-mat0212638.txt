    "the time evolution of a gas filled container divided by a massive piston is an old problem which has attracted much attention recently from both a conceptual and computational point of view , @xcite . while we do not believe that there is any `` paradox '' associated with this problem , the basic mechanism of energy transport across the piston from the hot side to the cold side which are at equal pressure but different temperatures ,",
    "was already described for an idealized version , by one of us in 1959 @xcite , many intriguing questions remain .",
    "not surprisingly the microscopic motion of the piston , and thus the time evolution of the system from an initial , far from equilibrium state , to the final true equilibrium state is not easy to compute analytically or even numerically for large systems @xcite .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider the greatly simplified case when the gas particles only interact via collisions with the massive piston @xcite .",
    "this serves , among other things , as a model for the approach to equilibrium in such a `` weakly '' interacting macroscopic system .",
    "here we carry out studies on this system under the `` simplest '' initial conditions .",
    "the positions and velocities of gas particles of unit mass , in an insulated box of size @xmath0 , are picked , at @xmath6 , from a poisson process with some density function , i.e.they are assumed to be independent random variables with a given double peaked velocity distribution @xmath7 ( see ( [ 0cutoff ] ) ) and a constant spatial density throughout the box .",
    "the piston , which acts as a single particle with area @xmath8 and mass @xmath1 , is then released at the position @xmath9 with zero velocity @xmath10 .",
    "it might be thought that the random fluctuations of the piston s velocity due to the initial randomness in the positions and velocities of the gas particles will be relatively small when @xmath11 is large ( the number of gas particles growing like @xmath0 ) and vanish in an appropriate hydrodynamic scaling limit ( as @xmath12 ) of time , space and piston mass .",
    "in fact , some rigorous results in this direction were obtained in @xcite and @xcite for a class of initial conditions more general than those considered here .",
    "it is proven in those papers that for those initial distributions the dynamics of the piston , in the hydrodynamic scaling limit , is governed by deterministic equations for as long as no particle collides with the piston more than twice .",
    "after that period , however , we could not control the random fluctuations in the particle configuration anymore .",
    "it is clear , though , that for an initial state which is spatially uniform and has the same velocity distribution on both sides of the piston , the deterministic macroscopic evolution would predict that the position of the piston remains stationary forever . on the other hand , when the initial velocity distribution of the particles is not maxwellian , the system is not at thermal equilibrium , and we expect it to somehow evolve toward equilibrium for almost any initial configuration ( with respect to the liouville measure on the energy surface ) .",
    "this is indeed what we found for every initial distribution .",
    "the path to the maxwellin taken by the system turned out however to be quite sensitive to the initial distribution .    here we present the results of detailed numerical simulations for one particular initial density @xmath13 that vanishes unless @xmath14 . we found that the quiescent state becomes unstable after a few ( 510 ) recollisions of each gas particle with the piston .",
    "the system then develops large ( on a macroscopic scale ) oscillatory motions which last for a long time .",
    "they look like smooth harmonic oscillations with an ( almost ) constant amplitude and piston speed comparable to that of the gas particles . eventually ,",
    "though , the oscillations dampen and vanish , and the system approaches a stable equilibrium state with constant gas density and maxwellian velocity distribution is characterized by the fact that by far the largest number of possible velocity distributions have the characteristic properties of the maxwell distribution , and compared to these there are only a relatively small number of possible distributions that deviate significantly form maxwell s . whereas zermelo says that the number of states that finally lead to the maxwellian state is small compared to all possible states , i assert on the contrary that by far the largest number of possible states are `` maxwellian '' and that the number that deviate from the maxwellian state is vanishingly small '' , @xcite , see also @xcite . ] .",
    "our main conclusions from the numerical investigations , which we also `` derive '' heuristically , is that 1 ) while the dynamics are non chaotic in the technical sense of there being no positive lyapunov exponents , there are for typical initial conditions with respect to the invariant liouville measure .",
    "there are clearly some exceptional initial configurations ( e.g. , those with a complete symmetry about @xmath15 with opposite velocities ) when @xmath16 at all times and so the speed of gas particles never changes .",
    "we expect ( for the reasons given by boltzman @xcite ) all such initial states to be unstable with respect to generic small perturbations . ]",
    "enough interactions to bring the system to equilibrium along `` interesting '' nontrivial pathways , and 2 ) that the time of onset of the instability grows with @xmath11 as @xmath3 .",
    "this means that even on the hydrodynamical scale @xmath17 , the deterministic behavior in which nothing happens on the spatial scale , @xmath18 , would remain valid when @xmath19 . in terms of @xmath20",
    "however this onset time grows only like @xmath21 so that in `` practice '' this behavior extends to macroscopic systems .",
    "we believe that this instability is related to the fact that the deterministic solutions are unstable for the kind of @xmath13 we consider here . for other initial @xmath13 ,",
    "for which the deterministic solution is stable , we do not get such large oscillations but , as expected , we still get an approach to maxwellian , see section  7 .",
    "consider a cubical container @xmath22\\times [ 0,l]\\times [ 0,l]$ ] filled with an ideal gas consisting of @xmath23 particles .",
    "the container is divided into two parts by a wall ( piston ) orthogonal to the @xmath2 axis . at time @xmath6 the wall is released and then it can move freely without friction inside @xmath24 along the @xmath2-axis , under the action of elastic collisions with the gas particles , each of which has the same fixed mass @xmath25 . since the piston s area is @xmath8 , we assume its mass @xmath26 to be proportional to @xmath8 and given by @xmath27 with a fixed constant @xmath28 ( we set @xmath29 and @xmath30 in our numerical simulations ) .",
    "since the components of the particle velocities perpendicular to the @xmath2-axis play no role in the dynamics of the piston , we may assume that each particle has only one component of velocity , @xmath31 , directed along the @xmath2-axis .",
    "hence , each gas particle can be specified by a pair @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "we shall take the total number of particles @xmath23 and the total kinetic energy of the system proportional to @xmath0 ; and we are interested in the behavior of the system for @xmath34 .",
    "the initial configuration of gas particles and their velocities @xmath35 is selected at random with statistics given by a ( two - dimensional ) poisson process on the @xmath36 plane with a given density , @xmath37 .",
    "more precisely , for any domain @xmath38 \\times \\ir^1 $ ] the number of particles in @xmath39 , i.e. @xmath40 , has a poisson distribution with parameter @xmath41 that is , for each @xmath42 , @xmath43 the numbers of particles in nonoverlapping domains are independent .",
    "the function @xmath7 takes values of order one , and the factor of @xmath8 is simply the cross - sectional area of the container @xmath24 .",
    "the piston is initially at rest at the midpoint , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and the position and velocity at time @xmath44 are denoted by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "we note that the total number of gas particles @xmath23 in the container is random .",
    "so are the numbers of particles to the left and to the right of the piston , call them @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "the initial total kinetic energy of the system , @xmath51 , is also a random variable .",
    "once chosen , the values of @xmath52 and the total kinetic energy @xmath53 of gas plus piston are ( presumably , the only ) integrals of motion .    the gas particles and the piston move freely ( with constant velocity ) between elastic collisions of particles with the piston and the walls . when a particle collides with a wall at @xmath54 or @xmath55 , its velocity simply reverses .",
    "if a particle with velocity @xmath31 hits the piston whose velocity is @xmath47 , then their velocities after the collision , call them @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , are given by v^= ( 1-)v + v [ v ] v^= -(1-)v + ( 2-)v [ v ] where = = ( ) [ varepsmm ]    in order to avoid recollisions of gas particles with the piston , for at least some initial period of time , we impose a velocity cutoff plays an important role in the later time evolution of the system . ]",

    ", there will be an initial time interval of length @xmath59 during which each particle colliding with the piston will have to travel to the wall , bounce off it , and then travel back to the piston before it can hit it again .",
    "therefore , during that interval , there will be no recollisions of any gas particle with the piston .",
    "we call such an interval of time the zero - recollision interval . likewise ,",
    "if the piston remains slow enough after recollisions occur , there will be another interval of time of order @xmath11 during which each gas particle experiences at most one recollision with the piston .",
    "we call it the one - recollision interval .",

    "the parameter @xmath11 changed in our simulations from @xmath89 to @xmath90 . for @xmath90",

    "also , the task of determining which particle is to collide with the piston next is nontrivial . to avoid a long search through the entire set of @xmath23 particles after each collision",
    ", we assembled a smaller group of particles located in a vicinity of the piston , where the search is performed , and updated this group periodically , as time goes on .",

    "this cycle of the gas motion in the container between the walls and the piston continues for a long time with the same period @xmath111 , independent of @xmath11 , but the amplitudes of both @xmath108 and @xmath104 are slowly decreasing , see fig .",

    ", we averaged over several experimentally generated trajectories ( for @xmath134 and 300 , just one trajectory was used ) .",
    "there are however other quantities such as @xmath135 , @xmath129 , and the related @xmath126 , which depend in a systematic way on @xmath11 .",
    "in particular , we estimated numerically that @xmath136 , hence @xmath137 , see fig .  5 .",
    "we will denote @xmath138 and discuss it further in section  6 .",

    ", we looked into the mechanism of the build - up of random fluctuations of the piston position and velocity , which eventually result in their large nearly harmonic oscillations . to this end",
    "we plotted the histogram of the ( empirical ) density of gas particles in the @xmath144 plane at various times @xmath145 , see samples in fig .",
    "6 . the initial density ( at time zero )",
    "is almost uniform over the domain @xmath86 and @xmath146 ( variations in the initial configuration always exist , because it is generated randomly ) .",
    "then , for @xmath147 , the piston experiences random collisions with particles and acquires a speed of order @xmath148 , see @xcite .",
    "these small fluctuations of the piston velocity result in changes of the velocities of the particles which leave the piston after collision .",
    "thus the outgoing particles on the right hand side of the piston have velocities in the interval @xmath149 while those on the left hand side of the piston have velocities in the interval @xmath150 .",
    "hence , the region in the @xmath144 plane where the density of the particles is positive is no longer a rectangle with straight sides , now its boundaries are curves whose shape nearly repeats the graph of the randomly evolving piston velocity @xmath104 . while the variations of @xmath151 of these boundary curves may seem small , it is crucial that on opposite sides of the piston they go in opposite directions . indeed , when @xmath152 , then the outgoing particles on the right hand side accelerate and those on the left hand side slow down .",
    "when @xmath153 the opposite happens .",
    "next , the particles that have collided with the piston travel to the wall and come back to the piston .",
    "now their densities are less regular than they were initially ",
    "the regions in the @xmath36 plane where the density is positive , are curvilinear domains .",
    "when they hit the piston , they shake it back and forth more forcefully than before , because the velocities of the incoming particles on the opposite sides of the piston are now negatively correlated . when particles on the right hand side are fast , those on the left hand side are slow , and vice versa .",
    "this produces a resonance - type effect destabilizing the piston dramatically and the velocity of the piston @xmath104 experiences larger fluctuations than before .",
    "the velocities of the newly outgoing particles will again go up and down in opposite direction , on a greater scale than before .",
    "as time goes on , the above phenomenon repeats over and over , with larger and larger fluctuations of the gas and piston velocities , until the distribution of gas particles completely breaks down . at times",
    "@xmath154 , two large clusters of particles are formed , one on each side of the piston . when one cluster bombards the piston , the other moves away from it and hits the wall , then they exchange their roles .",
    "the clusters have sizes of about 0.30.5 in the @xmath98 direction and the particle velocities range from about 0.2 to just over 1 .",
    "the average velocity is about 0.50.6 and so the clusters hammer the piston periodically with period 1.62.0 , which is close to the experimentally determined period of piston oscillations , see above .",
    "6 shows six snapshots of the empirical density of gas particles taken at different times . at @xmath155",
    "the gas fills ( almost uniformly ) two rectangles @xmath156 . at @xmath157",
    "one can see some ripples on the boundaries of these rectangles . at time",
    "@xmath158 the irregularities grow and at @xmath159 the rectangular shape is broken down .",
    "two large clusters of particles are formed , both appear in the upper half - plane @xmath160 , i.e.  at that time both clusters move to the right ( one toward the piston , the other away from it ) . later the density undergoes strange formations ( @xmath161 ) but eventually smoothes out and enters a slow process of convergence to maxwellian ( @xmath162 ) described below . note a narrow white line around @xmath163 , meaning the total lack of very slow particles at time @xmath162",
    ".    a longer sequence of snapshots at times @xmath164 is posted on the web page @xmath165 it gives a spectacular view of the entire system evolution .",
    "the above analysis may suggest that the fluctuations of the piston velocity roughly increase by a constant factor during each time interval of length one .",
    "indeed , initial random fluctuations @xmath166 result in additional changes of velocities of outgoing particles by @xmath167 .",
    "when those particles come back to the piston ( in time @xmath168 ) , they kick its velocity to the level of @xmath167 . then the newly outgoing particles acquire an additional velocity @xmath169 , etc . over each time interval of length one the fluctuations",
    "double in size .",
    "this is an obvious oversimplification of the real dynamics , but it leads to a reasonable conjecture w_a ( ) [ wa ] where @xmath170 are typical fluctuations of the piston velocity at time @xmath20 and @xmath171 are constants .",
    "we tested the above formula numerically as follows .",
    "let @xmath172 be some preset critical value of the piston speed and @xmath173 the ( random ) time when @xmath174 is first reached .",
    "this time plays the role of the `` onset '' of large fluctuations of the piston velocity .",
    "one would expect , based on ( [ wa ] ) that _ c ( w_cl / c)/r [ tauc ] i.e. @xmath143 grows as @xmath175 when @xmath11 increases .",

    "we examined the convergence of the velocity distribution of gas particles to a maxwellian . at",

    ", we used the supremum of the difference @xmath182 initially , @xmath183 for our choice of @xmath13 .",
    "one can expect that @xmath184 converges to 0 as @xmath20 grows when @xmath23 is large .",
    "in fact , if the velocities @xmath185 were independent and had maxwellian distribution ( which it would be in true statistical equilibrium ) , then @xmath184 would be of order @xmath186 , and the product @xmath187 would have a certain limit distribution , see the theory of the kolmogorov - smirnov statistical test @xcite .",

    "then almost every trajectory eventually behaves according to the invariant measure @xmath219 , independently of the initial state . in particular , for any initial gas density and velocity distribution ( given by the function @xmath66 , see section  [ secdm ] ) the hydrodynamic regime for a finite @xmath11 is only valid on a finite interval of time  eventually the system will relax to equilibrium .",
    "we expect in fact that in terms of the `` macroscopic '' variables , say , the one particle distribution function , the system will relax to an effective equilibrium , as defined by ( [ taueq ] ) in terms of @xmath189 , which is much smaller than the exponentially long time ( in @xmath11 ) required for the ergodic theorem .",
    "so the real question is how does this time depend on @xmath11 . according to our earlier discussion @xmath222 and @xmath223 .    at equilibrium ,",
    "the distribution of coordinates @xmath207 and velocities @xmath185 are determined by the liouville measure @xmath219 , which is uniform in the phase space .",
    "physically interesting ( and only observable ) are its marginal measures , i.e. projections , on lower - dimensional subspaces .",
    "the marginal measures of the velocities are normal ( gaussian ) for large @xmath23 ( as @xmath224 ) .",
    "in particular , each individual velocity @xmath185 converges in law to a maxwellian ( i.e. , normal ) distribution with zero mean and variance @xmath225const .",
    "the same holds for the `` piston '' component of the velocity , @xmath226 , hence the piston velocity @xmath47 will be normally distributed with zero mean and standard deviation const@xmath227const@xmath228 , as @xmath12 . in our case",
    "@xmath47 has standard deviation @xmath229 .",
    "this conclusion agrees well with our numerical data , discussed earlier .",
    "assume all the initial velocities are of order one , and note that the largest maxwellian velocities are of order @xmath230 .",
    "since each collision with the piston adds @xmath151 to a particle s velocity , it takes @xmath231 collisions to reach the maximum . an amazing agreement with the estimate @xmath232 reported near fig .",
    "the equilibrium distribution of the piston coordinate @xmath45 is also determined by the projection of the uniform measure @xmath233 on @xmath211 onto the @xmath234 axis . before we do that ,",
    "let us get rid of @xmath206 in the definition of both @xmath211 and @xmath234 .",
    "a simple change of variable @xmath235 allows us to redefine @xmath211 by @xmath236 furthermore , rescaling @xmath93 and @xmath237 gives a new , simpler , definition of @xmath211 : @xmath238 `` integrating away '' the variables @xmath239 yields the following equilibrium density for @xmath109 : @xmath240 for @xmath94 , where @xmath241 is the normalizing factor that can be computed explicitly .",
    "put @xmath242 , then the density of @xmath243 is given asymptotically by @xmath244 .",
    "hence , @xmath109 is asymptotically gaussian with mean @xmath245 and variance @xmath246 .",
    "therefore , in equilibrium @xmath247 and the probability of observing larger fluctuations is exponentially small in @xmath23 .",
    "note that fact is independent of the piston mass , as it has to be for an equilibrium ( classical ) system .",
    "this is consistent with our observation of the piston coordinate reaching a positive constant value , @xmath248 , during a short time interval @xmath196 , since our initial conditions were selected according to the density function @xmath66 which has probability exponentially small in @xmath23 .",
    "\\1 . we checked the accuracy of our computer program in various ways .",
    "a simple one was based on the effect of round - offs on the energy of the system : the total energy was found to be practically constant over the whole period @xmath249 .",
    "a more sensitive test of the accuracy of the computations consists in using the time - reversal symmetry of the dynamics .",
    "suppose at some time @xmath250 the velocities of all gas particles and the piston are reversed ( @xmath251 ) . then the system is supposed to trace back its past trajectory and arrive to its initial state with all velocities reversed at time @xmath252 .",
    "we verified this property numerically for various @xmath253 and always found that the system did repeat its past trajectory in the sense that the graphs of @xmath108 and @xmath104 over the interval @xmath254 looked like perfect mirror images of the corresponding graphs over the interval @xmath255 .",
    "therefore , one can assume that round off errors remain negligibly small during times @xmath256 . however , this accuracy test failed for larger times , @xmath257 , indicating that the system then `` loses memory '' of its initial state due to round - offs .",
    "this does not seem to affect the overall picture , though . as yet another test",
    ", we carried out some computations with single rather than double precision , and found that the changes were little .",
    "still , some estimates requiring long runs , such as the equilibrium time @xmath189 on fig .  8 , might not be very accurate .",
    "we tested the dependence of the piston oscillations on the @xmath258 factor involved in the formula @xmath27 . remember that we set @xmath30 in our main experiments . when we changed it to @xmath259 ( this made the piston 10 times heavier ) , then the oscillations started slightly later and their amplitude was slightly larger , but otherwise the picture was very much the same .",
    "when we changed @xmath258 to 0.2 ( and this made the piston 10 times lighter ) , then the oscillations started at about the same time as for @xmath30 , but they dampened somewhat faster .",
    "we also tried to change the piston mass @xmath26 even more drastically .",
    "when we set it to @xmath0 ( insteas of @xmath8 ) , it appeared that oscillations started only after a very long initial quiescent period .",
    "but we did not examine this fact in detail , see @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "when we set the piston mass @xmath26 to @xmath11 ( instead of @xmath8 ) , large oscillations started very soon , but very quickly dampened and disappeared .",
    "we note that eq .",
    "( [ w1 ] ) describes the time evolution of a damped harmonic oscillator . accepting ( [ w1 ] ) over some time range , say , @xmath260 $ ] for @xmath92 , we can then look at the `` inverse problem '' of finding the effective spring constant and damping coefficient .    using the original variables , @xmath44 and @xmath261",
    ", we write @xmath262 which has the solution @xmath263 with @xmath264^{1/2}\\ ] ] this yields , to the lowest order in @xmath265 , remembering that @xmath266 and that @xmath267 , with @xmath268 , @xmath269 , i.e. the effective `` restoring force '' @xmath270 is independent of @xmath11 . on the other hand ,",
    "the damping coefficient is @xmath271 , were @xmath272 was found experimentally to decrease as @xmath273 with @xmath274 , see section  4 .",
    "hence @xmath275 , i.e. the damping gets weaker as @xmath12 .",
    "we have presented here numerical results concerning the time evolution of a system with many degrees of freedom ( up to @xmath276 ) one of which , the position of the piston , plays a very special role . starting with the particular initial particle distribution given by ( [ pini ] ) we found two striking features of the evolution :",
    "( 1 ) the velocity distribution of the particles approaches a maxwellian , i.e. the system goes toward thermal equilibrium and ( 2 ) the time evolution of the piston followed closely , after some initial period , that of a damped harmonic oscillator over an extended time interval , with initial oscillations as large as 1/10 of the system size .",
    "as already noted , we expect from general considerations @xcite that ( 1 ) should be true for any initial density @xmath66 provided the number of particles @xmath23 ( @xmath277 ) is large enough and one waits long enough .",
    "but what about ( 2 ) ? clearly ,",
    "if we choose for @xmath278 a maxwellian , we expect only thermal fluctuations of order @xmath279 in the position of the piston .",
    "this is indeed what we found numerically .",
    "for other , non - maxwellian , initial densities the question turns out to be far from trivial .",
    "we are currently working with more general initial densities and will report results in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "below we outline our program and mention some preliminary findings .    for simplicity , we assume that @xmath280 and @xmath9 , @xmath10 . in this case",
    "there is no apriori bias for the piston to move at all , and as already noted , the hydrodynamical ( deterministic ) equations , see @xcite , predict that , in the limit @xmath12 , the system would remain frozen in the initial state : @xmath281 and @xmath282 for all @xmath78 ( in the variables @xmath98 and @xmath20 , see section  2 ) .",
    "the density @xmath283 will also remain constant in time .",
    "but what about the particle system with a large but finite @xmath11 ?",
    "how will the piston and the gas behave while the particle velocities make their way to a maxwellian ?    to answer this question we note that since the initial configuration of particles is generated randomly from a poisson process with the density @xmath284 , the actual ( empirical ) density of the particles , such as the one shown on fig .  6 at @xmath155 ,",
    "does not exactly coincide with @xmath285 .",
    "random fluctuations of the empirical density are typically of order @xmath151 .",
    "hence , the actual initial distribution of particles can be thought of as a small perturbation of the function @xmath278 and can be written as @xmath286 with @xmath287 and some ( random ) function @xmath288 of order one .",
    "now , we conjecture that for large @xmath11 the evolution of the particle system closely follows the solutions of the hydrodynamical equations derived in @xcite with a perturbed initial density @xmath286 , rather than the stationary solution corresponding to the unperturbed density @xmath278 . in particular ,",
    "if the latter solution is unstable , then small perturbations grow exponentially in time ( in the units of @xmath62 , of course ) , hence the system can be destabilized in @xmath289 units of time .",
    "this would be in agreement with our analysis and numerical estimates in the end of section  4 .",
    "hence , the instability of the hydrodynamical equations becomes a key issue .    when we were finishing the present paper , we received a message from e.  caglioti and e.  presutti who ( a ) proved that the hydrodynamical equations are stable when @xmath278 is monotonically nonincreasing in @xmath290 , i.e.  @xmath291 , and ( b ) suggested that they might be unstable for our class on non - monotone @xmath278 .",
    "we checked the suggestion ( b ) for our particular density ( [ pini ] ) and found that it was indeed correct ; we proved that small perturbations grow exponentially in @xmath20 .",
    "furthermore , when starting with a perturbed initial density with @xmath292 , we found numerically that the corresponding solution of the hydrodynamical equations resembled very well the evolution of the particle system described here , including large nearly harmonic oscillations of the piston during the interval @xmath293 .",
    "further work in this direction is currently under way @xcite .",
    "conversely , when we simulated a particle dynamics with a nonincreasing initial density @xmath278 the oscillations essentially disappeared for @xmath294 and a triangular one @xmath295 . ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the particle velocity distribution still approached a maxwellian , albeit at a somewhat slower pace .",
