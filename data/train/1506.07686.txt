    "the key idea that underlies establishing the exponential series as a lie series is to express the flowmap in fisk ",

    "the @xmath8 are associated governing vector fields which we assume are sufficiently smooth and in general non - commuting .",
    "we suppose the solution process @xmath3 , which is @xmath4-valued for some @xmath5 , exists on some finite or possibly infinite time interval . in coordinates the vector fields @xmath8 for each @xmath6 act as first order partial differential operators on any function @xmath14",
    "as follows @xmath15 for brevity we will often express this vector field action as @xmath16 or @xmath17 .",
    "we define the flowmap @xmath18 as the map prescribing the transport of the initial data @xmath19 to the solution @xmath20 at time @xmath21 for any smooth function @xmath22 on @xmath4 , i.e. @xmath23 .",
    "the solution @xmath24 corresponds to the choice @xmath25 , the identity map .",
    "the it chain rule is the key to developing the taylor series expansion for the solution @xmath3 about the initial data .",
    "the it chain rule implies that for any function @xmath14 , the quantity @xmath26 satisfies @xmath27_\\tau,\\ ] ] see for example protter  @xcite . in this formula",

    "the algebra on the right should be endowed with a concatenation product , to reflect the fact that the composition of two differential operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 generates the differential operator equivalent to that represented by the concatenation of the words @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in the next section",
