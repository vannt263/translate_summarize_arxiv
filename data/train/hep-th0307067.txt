    "there are several energy conditions in general relativity which try to make a precise statement of the common sense notion that matter has positive energy density .",
    "the weak energy condition ( wec ) states that no observer sees negative energy density , in other words that [ eqn : wec ] t_v^v^ , where @xmath1 is the stress - energy tensor and @xmath2 is any timelike vector . if instead we consider null @xmath2 in eq.([eqn : wec ] ) , we get the null energy condition ( nec ) .",
    "the energy density between parallel conducting plates in the traditional casimir effect @xcite is negative , and thus provides one example of a system for which the wec is violated .",
    "the pressure in the casimir system is negative in the direction between the plates , so with @xmath2 pointing from one plate toward the other , the nec is also violated .",
    "however , null vectors parallel to the plates have @xmath3 because the positive pressure in that direction cancels the negative energy density",
    ".    the averaged weak energy condition ( awec ) permits the violation of the wec locally , but insists that when one integrates the wec over a complete geodesic with tangent vector @xmath2 , the result will be non - negative , [ eqn : awec ] _",
    "-^dx t_v^v^. the averaged null energy condition ( anec ) is just eq.([eqn : awec ] ) for null geodesics .",
    "one can imagine an observer at rest between the plates in the casimir system , so that @xmath2 points only in the time direction .",
    "for that observer , the awec is violated .",
    "however , the casimir system does not violate the anec , because geodesics parallel to the plates obey the nec , while those that are not parallel eventually intersect the plates and pick up a large positive contribution from the plate material .",
    "the anec is in a certain sense the weakest of these conditions .",
    "if the anec is violated then the nec must be violated somewhere , and so the wec must also be violated , or else the nec would hold by continuity . for a localized system in flat space , anec violation implies awec violation by the same continuity argument , but otherwise they are independent @xcite . nevertheless , the anec is sufficient to rule out many exotic phenomena , such as traversable wormholes @xcite , superluminal travel @xcite , and closed timelike curves @xcite , and to prove singularity theorems @xcite .",
    "it is very important to understand under what conditions the averaged null energy condition is violated , as klinkhammer urged in @xcite .",
    "klinkhammer found that for a _ free _ scalar field in minkowski spacetime , the anec is satisfied .",
    "however , he found anec violations for the free scalar field in a flat cylindrical topology , which corresponds to closing minkowski space in one spatial direction .",
    "we study here a quantum field theory ( qft ) problem of a minimally coupled real massless scalar field outside a spherically symmetric background potential ( i.e. , a field with a position - dependent mass ) , in the calculational framework developed in @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nec ] we obtain a general expression for the null projection of the stress - energy tensor in arbitrary dimension , followed by the results for 3 + 1 dimensions . in sec .",
    "[ sec : hard ] we specialize to the case of a perfectly reflecting sphere in 3 + 1 dimensions .",
    "we find that the nec is violated for radial motion and obeyed for azimuthal motion , whilst its validity for intermediate directions depends on the distance from the sphere .",
    "we then calculate the anec by integrating over a geodesic that passes outside the sphere .",
    "although the nec is violated far from the sphere where the motion is primarily radial , the points closer to the sphere dominate , and as a result the anec is always obeyed .    in sec .",
    "[ sec:2d ] we briefly report our calculations of the nec and anec outside a perfectly reflecting circle in 2 + 1 dimensions .",
    "the results are very similar to those for 3 + 1 dimensions , and once again we find that although the nec may be violated , the anec is satisfied .",
    "in this section we find a general expression for the nec , for the case of a minimally coupled , real scalar field outside a potential .",
    "the lagrangian is = and the stress - energy tensor is [ eqn : stressenergytensor ] t_=__+_. for a null vector , @xmath4 , so we have t_v^v^= ( v^_)^2 . for a static system , @xmath5 . if we further choose coordinates in which @xmath6 is diagonal , and @xmath7 , then t_v^v^= ^2 + _ i ( v_i_i)^2 .",
    "we are going to calculate the nec for the scalar field outside a potential that is spherically symmetric in @xmath8 spatial dimensions . using spherical coordinates and choosing @xmath9 to lie in the equatorial plane , we find [ eqn : sphericalnec ] t_v^v^= ^2 + ( v_r_r)^2 + ( v _ _ ) ^2 where @xmath10 is the component of the velocity in the radial direction and @xmath11 is the azimuthal component . since we are taking @xmath12 , @xmath13 .    decomposing the quantum field @xmath14 in terms of modes",
