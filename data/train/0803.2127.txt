    "photo - induced phase transitions have attracted ongoing attention because of their application in storage devices @xcite .",
    "properties required for commercial memory media , such as fast switching , stability of the photo - converted state , and high level cyclability singled out phase - change effect in te - based chalcogenides .",
    "commercially utilized materials are ge - sb - te alloys mainly in the form of @xmath0 ( gst ) used in digital versatile discs ( dvds ) dvd - ram and ag - in - sb - te ( aist ) alloys used in dvd - rw @xcite .",
    "@xmath0 stands over a million cycles , the switching time is on the nanosecond time scale and even femtosecond pulses are sufficient to render the material amorphous @xcite .    as is typical for many optically sensitive materials @xcite",
    ", amorphous chalcogenides are intrinsically metastable and undergo various structural transformations under the influence of an external perturbation , in particular light . what makes these materials special ?",
    "it is very difficult to believe that a material will stand millions of melting / solidification cycles without degradation of parameters and an essentially specific mechanism should be found .",
    "the fundamentals of phase- change mechanism are just starting to emerge but striking features of both groups of materials are : ( i ) the existence of longer and shorter bonds between similar pairs of atom types in the crystalline state @xcite , ( ii ) bond shortening in the amorphous state @xcite , and ( iii ) a considerable degree of intrinsic disorder , manifested in high concentrations of vacancies in gst @xcite and a random occupancy of sites in aist @xcite .",
    "the first feature suggests that certain bonds in the system are weaker and can be selectively broken , the second one is an indication of the local atomic structure in the two states being significantly different , and the last property points to considerable concentration of defect levels in the gap .    in this letter",
    ", we propose a model that explains the unusual features of the structural changes in the class of phase - transition chalcogenides .",
    "we concentrate on changes in a typical compound , @xmath0 , although our generic statements , based on the similarity of properties ( i)-(iii ) , are general for all phase- change compounds .",
    "in the metastable form of gst te ions form a well ordered fcc sublattice , with ge and sb being displaced from the center of the cell @xcite . as a result , there are subsystems of shorter and longer bonds .",
    "the shorter ge(sb)-te bond lengths are 2.83     and 2.91   , respectively .",
    "the longer bonds are on the order of @xmath2   . in addition , there are 20 percent vacancies on the ge / sb sites that are intrinsic to the structure @xcite but the role and exact location of which is not definitely known",
    ". it should be stressed , that the intermediate- and long - range order of the crystal structure are not finally clear the best description to - date being distorted rock - salt like structure with large isotropic thermal displacement parameter .",
    "fragments of the gst structures with the te fcc lattice and a ge atom located in the octahedral ( a ) and tetrahedral ( b ) symmetry sites .",
    "other ge ( and sb ) atoms are not shown .",
    "the lower panel ( c ) shows the molecular fragments ( 8 te atoms and 1 ge atom ) within which the ge switching is considered .",
    ", width=8 ]      it was shown @xcite that upon exposure to intense laser pulses ge atoms switch from an octahedral position at the center of the rocksalt cell into a tetrahedral position within the te fcc sublattice ( fig .",
    "1a , b ) which is responsible for the fast performance and high stability of the medium .",
    "it was suggested @xcite and subsequently unequivocally demonstrated by _ ab initio _",
    "simulations @xcite that the total energies of ge - sb - te for these two structures are rather close which explains why both states possess high stability .",
    "however , a very important question remained unanswered , namely , what drives the ge atom to switch to a tetrahedral symmetry position upon photoexcitation ?    it should be noted that even the short bonds in gst ( 2.83     for ge - te and 2.91     for sb - te ) are significantly longer that the sum of the corresponding covalent radii ( @xmath3   , @xmath4   , @xmath5     @xcite ) , i.e. all bonds - assuming they are covalent - are stretched .",
    "this is a crucial assumption that has to be justified . to address this issue ,",
    "we have measured bulk xps spectra of @xmath0 using high- energy synchrotron radiation as the excitation source .",
    "our measurements yielded the following values for the bonding energies : ge 3d - 30.8 ev , sb 3d@xmath6 - 529.6 ev , te 3d@xmath6 - 573.2 ev .",
    "these values are similar to those in covalently bonded solids @xcite .",
    "the absence of charge transfer has been independently deduced from _ ab initio _",
    "simulations @xcite .",
    "it would seem that a simple decrease in the lattice parameter would have reduced the strains thus lowering the total energy .",
    "however , the system prefers a larger lattice parameter and stretched ( strained ) bonds . the most plausible explanation for this is the fact that the te fcc sublattice is intrinsically much stronger than the ge(sb)-te interaction @xcite . in line with this",
    "is also the fact that si - te bond lengths for octahedrally and tetrahedrally coordinated si in si@xmath7te@xmath8 have the same lengths @xcite as those for ge - te , although si has a covalent radius that is significantly ( 0.11   ) smaller than that of ge .",
    "as already stated above , the details of the structure beyond the short - range order ( i.e. including just a few atoms ) are not known in either crystalline or amorphous cases .",
    "for this reason any reliable modern solid - state calculations are not possible : one is naturally limited to a very crude short - range order model .",
    "to the first approximation we can consider that ge ions switch within a rigid te sublattice as shown in fig .",
    "1a , b . as the simplest model we can consider motion of a relatively light ge ion within the eight nearest ( and heavy ) te atoms ( fig .",
    "based on very simple considerations the potential experienced by the ge ion located at distance @xmath9 from a te ion can be expressed in terms of a standard ion - ion interaction relation : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the covalent energy , @xmath12 is the independent of distance polar energy , and the first term is the interionic repulsion @xcite . in equation ( [ hari ] )",
    "the plus and minus signs correspond to bonding and antibonding states , respectively .    to determine the parameters of the interaction we used covalent radii @xmath13    and @xmath14    to get the equilibrium of potential at @xmath15     which , implying the condition @xmath16 , fixes the repulsion parameter@xmath17 .",
    "the polar energy @xmath18 ev is determined in ref .",
    "@xcite and a reasonable value of covalent attraction @xmath19 ev @xcite in equilibrium gives a=13.2  ev  @xmath20 . with the above parameters we have calculated the potential for a ge atom moving within a rigid te lattice along the @xmath21 $ ] direction as shown in fig .",
    "potentials for the ge atom in the field of eight te atoms in the ground state and in the state where one of the weak bonds is excited ( upper panel ) @xcite .",
    "the schematic drawing represents the considered molecule .",
    "the lower panel demonstrates the stabilisation of the tetrahedral geometry by relaxation of the network ( te atoms 5,6,7 have been moved away in the direction perpendicular to the axis by 0.1   .",
    ", width=8 ]    the ground state curve in fig .",
    "2 presents the potential in the ground state .",
    "the origin of the coordinate @xmath22 - which represents the position of the ge atom along the 111 axis - corresponds to the centrosymmetric position of ge between the two te triangles shown in fig .",
    "the experimental positions of ge are @xmath23    in the crystalline state and @xmath24    in the amorphous state .",
    "it is seen that the very simple form of interaction ( [ hari ] ) reproduces general features of the system with the crystalline global minimum at @xmath25 and higher amorphous local minima at @xmath26   .",
    "besides , although the minima of potential ( [ hari ] ) from three te ions ( located off the [ 111 ] axis ) to the right ( left ) correspond to r=0.86     ( r=-0.86   ) , the joint action of left and right te ions creates a broad minimum at @xmath25 .    from the jahn - teller theorem",
    "it is known @xcitethat centrosymmetric structures are locally unstable and centrosymmetric positions in solids are allowed as a consequence of long - range stabilizing forces that occur within a macroscopic periodic lattice . for the case of gst , the high concentration ( 20% ) of vacancies destroys the long - range order leading to the formation of the non - centrosymmetric distorted rocksalt structure .",
    "this is evidenced by the loss of long - range order in the ge / sb sublattice , as opposed to the well defined te sublattice where long - range spatial correlations are clearly visible @xcite .    to reproduce the displacement of the ge atom from the centrosymmetric position we introduce jahn - teller coupling @xmath27 and a coupling to an external electric field @xmath28 caused by non - symetric distribution of vacancies in the ge / sb sublattice .",
    "the above interactions create an additional potential @xcite @xmath29 we chose the values @xmath30 ev  @xmath31 and @xmath32  ev@xmath31 to reproduce the experimental position of ge .",
    "the non- adiabatic matrix element @xmath33 ev does not change the potential significantly though gives possibility to avoid an unphysical jump of the second derivative of potential at r=0 .     at low ( left ) and high ( right ) excitation levels .",
    ", width=8 ]    when an electron on one of the ( long ) bonds is transferred to the antibonding orbital due to photoexcitation @xcite , the potential changes drastically ( fig .",
    "2 , the excited curve ) . in particular , in the excited state",
    "there appears a force acting on the ge ion . the excited ge ion relaxes into a position corresponding to the minimum located at 2.6   , i.e. at the tetrahedral position .",
    "we estimated the relaxation time to be on the scale of @xmath34 s ( the inverse of the phonon frequency ) and the atom travels a distance of about 2   .",
    "a simple estimate gives an impressive speed of @xmath35 m / s .",
    "a simple analogy of the process is a slingshot shooting a ge atom .    at the same time , the ( 5,6,7 ) te atoms that were previously bonded to the ge atom by the longer bonds , experience a stronger interaction with the sb atoms located on the other side ( sb atoms are not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the sb - te bonds shrink by about 0.1    as evidenced by the exafs data @xcite , resulting in a te lattice distortion ( see fig . 5 of ref .",
    "if the three ( 5,6,7 ) te atoms are moved away from the axis by 0.1   , the tetrahedral geometry becomes the lowest in energy as shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "2 ( relaxed curve ) .",
    "the lattice relaxation thus stabilises the tetrahedral position of the ge atom .",
    "the energy barrier , separating the octahedral and tetrahedral sites is on the order of 0.1 - 0.2 ev in our simple model which is similar to the value obtained through advanced _",
    "ab - initio _",
    "simulations @xcite .",
    "an important issue is why one needs intense laser pulses to induce the phase change .",
    "vacancies in semiconductors are known to produce deep donor states @xcite .",
    "the presence of a very large concentration of vacancies in the @xmath0 structure thus leads to the chemical potential being pinned near the valence band .",
    "the local switching of ge from octahedral to tetrahedral coordination in the dilute limit gives rise to complex defects ( a vacancy plus an interstitial ge atom ) within the rocksalt structure with corresponding states in the gap .",
    "since the total energies of @xmath0 containing ge atoms in octahedral and tetrahedral symmetry positions are very close @xcite , we can expect energy levels corresponding to individual tetrahedrally coordinated ge atoms ( and corresponding vacancies ) to be located closer to the valence band .    at room temperature and at low excitation levels ,",
    "the states of the complex defects are located above the chemical potential and are hence unoccupied as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : bandstructure ] , left .",
    "in this situation , a single excitation event results in an unstable tetrahedral ge site which readily decays back to the original structure . under intense optical excitation , the chemical potential moves towards mid - gap .",
    "in this situation the defect states are located below the chemical potential and are now occupied ( stable ) ( fig .",
    "3 , right ) .",
    "once the concentration of these defects becomes sufficiently large and their wavefunctions overlap , the electronic structure changes to that of the `` amorphous '' state .",
    "the same result can - in principle - be achieved by heating .",
    "indeed , our recent xanes measurements ( not shown here ) have demonstrated that upon melting ge atoms acquire tetrahedral symmetry positions .",
    "there is , however , a very important difference .",
    "a focused laser beam excites a very small volume and upon cessation of the laser pulse the heat can dissipate fast enough to leave the newly created structure stable . with thermal heating ,",
    "the heated volume is large and can not be quenched fast enough ; the system can overcome the energy barrier between the amorphous and crystalline states eventually producing the crystalline phase .",
    "we would like to stress here that the transition into the tetrahedral structure is localized , i.e. upon rupture of the long ge - te bonds _ individual _ ge _ atoms _ switch due to a force acting on them in the excited state .",
    "this process is extremely fast . to restore the original structure , on the other hand , long - range interactions are important",
    "this process requires motion of _ many atoms _ and for this reason crystallization is a slower process than amorphization .",
    "it is possible that collectiveness of the crystallization process is the reason why the experimentally measured activation energy for the crystallization is higher that the higher than the energy barrier for an individual transition .",
    "to conclude , we suggest that photoexcitation of a weak ge - te bond in a distorted rocksalt structure produces a net force acting on the ge ions along the @xmath21 $ ] direction which drives the phase transition towards the so - called amorphous state . the subsequent distortion of the te lattice stabilizes the tetrahedral structure which ensures the stability of the recorded bit . whilst the detailed discussion above refers to a specific material , the similarity of crucial for our mechanism properties ( i)-(iii ) in all phase - transition chalcogenides is indicative of a similar transformation mechanism in all of them .",
    "namely , the transition is initiated by photoexcitation of the strained bonds and subsequent lattice relaxation stabilises the newly established local structure .",
    "a necessity for shift of the chemical potential towards mid- gap that is needed to stabilize the tetrahedral sites is the reason why this process requires high photon fluxes .    while for the most part we we concentrated on photoexcitation of the weak bonds , we believe that the above considerations are also valid for electronic memory devices when the material is switched between the two states by intense current pulses .",
    "application of high electric fields leads to injection of charge carriers from the electrodes that are likely to behave in a similar way as photo - excied carriers .",
