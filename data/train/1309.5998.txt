    "<S> we investigate the emergence of localized coherent behavior in systems consisting of two populations of social agents possessing a condition for non - interacting states , mutually coupled through global interaction fields . </S>",

    "<S> we find localized coherent states for some values of parameters , consisting of one population in a homogeneous state and the other in a disordered state . </S>",

    "<S> the study of the collective behaviors in systems consisting of two interacting populations of dynamical elements is a topic of much interest in various sciences . </S>",

    "<S> , one population exhibits a coherent or synchronized behavior while the other is incoherent or desynchronized . </S>",
    "<S> the recent experimental discovery of such chimera states has fundamental implications as it shows that localized coherence and structured patterns can emerge from otherwise structureless systems @xcite . as noted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , analogous symmetry breaking is observed in dolphins and other animals that have evolved to sleep with only half of their brain at a time : neurons exhibit synchronized activity in the sleeping hemisphere and desynchronized activity in the hemisphere that is awake @xcite .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the emergence of localized coherence in systems consisting of two populations of social agents coupled through reciprocal global interactions . in a first system , </S>",
    "<S> we employ , as interaction dynamics , axelrod s @xcite rules for the dissemination of culture among agents in a society , a model that has attracted much attention from physicists @xcite . in the second system that we consider , </S>",
    "<S> we introduce a discrete version of the bounded confidence model proposed by deffuant et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where agents can influence each other s opinion provided that opinions are already sufficiently close enough . in both models of interaction dynamics , the agent - agent interaction rule is such that no interaction exists for some relative values characterizing the states of the agents that compose the system . </S>",
    "<S> this type of interaction is common in social and biological systems where there is often some bound or threshold for the occurrence of interaction between agents , such as a similarity condition for the state variable @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the global interactions act as fields @xcite that can be interpreted as mass media messages originated in each population . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our system can serve as a model for cross - cultural interactions between two social groups , each with its own internal dynamics , but getting information about each other through their reciprocal mass media influences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the study of cross - cultural experiences through mass - mediated contacts is a relevant issue in the social sciences @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that , in both models and under some circumstances , one population reaches a homogeneous state while a disordered state appears on the other . </S>",

    "<S> the models that we have considered contain two main ingredients : ( i ) the possibility of non - interacting states in the interaction dynamics , and ( ii ) the presence of reciprocal global interactions between the populations . </S>",
    "<S> the global interaction field associated to each population corresponds to the statistical mode of the states of the agents . in the context of social dynamics , this type of global fields can be interpreted as mass media messages about `` trends '' originated in one population and being transmitted to the other population .    in both models , </S>",
    "<S> we have found localized coherent states , consisting of one population in a homogeneous state and the other in an disordered state . </S>",
    "<S> these symmetry breaking states arise for different partitions of the two populations . </S>",
    "<S> these configurations occur with a probability that depend on parameters of the system , @xmath28 and @xmath74 in model i , and @xmath28 and @xmath115 in model ii . </S>",
    "<S> once it has emerged , a localized coherent state is stable . </S>",
    "<S> these states can be considered as intermediate configurations between a partially coherent state and a common homogeneous state .    </S>",
    "<S> the localized coherent states reported here are reminiscent of the chimera states that have been found in two populations of dynamical oscillators having global or long range interactions , where one population in a coherent state coexist with the other in a incoherent state @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in addition , other asymptotic collective behaviors can appear in these systems depending on parameter values : a common homogeneous state , where both populations share the same state ; different homogeneous states , where both population reach homogenous states but different from each other ; and a disordered state , where both populations reach inhomogeneous states .    </S>",
    "<S> the observation of localized coherent states in the context of social dynamics suggests that the emergence of chimeralike states should be a common feature in distributed dynamical systems where global interactions coexist with local interactions . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon should also be expected in other non - equilibrium systems possessing the characteristic of non - interacting states , such as social and biological systems whose dynamics usually possess a bound condition for interaction . </S>",
    "<S> it would also be of interest to search for localized coherent states in complex networks of social agents , such as communities , where the interaction between populations occurs through a few elements rather than global fields . </S>"
