    "astrophysical disks are ubiquitous and sources of active phenomena in the various system of the universe ; the star - compact object systems , star - planet systems , active galactic nuclei ( agns ) , and so forth .",
    "although the standard theory of accretion disks@xcite has succeeded in explaining them , there are still many unsolved problems .    high - energy emission from galactic black hole binaries and agns can not be produced by the accretion flow , except for the accretion flow accompanied by a corona , derived from the standard disk theory , where radiative cooling is so efficient that the thermal energy heated up by the viscosity is locally radiated away .",
    "if the radiative cooling becomes inefficient , the thermal energy is transported inward with accretion , and then the flow becomes hot .",
    "such a flow can produce high - energy emission and is generally called as radiatively inefficient accretion flow ( riaf ) ( chap .",
    "9 of @xcite ) .",
    "the proto - type model of the riaf is an optically thin advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf)(@xcite ; see also chap .",

    "most galaxies are thought to have massive black holes at their centers @xcite and to coevolve with them@xcite .",
    "galaxy merger leads to the mass inflow to the central region and then a nucleus of the merged galaxy is activated and black hole grows by gas accretion . during a sequence of processes , binary massive black holes with a sub - parsec scale separation are inevitably formed before two black holes merge by emitting gravitational radiation@xcite . by interaction with surrounding stars ( @xcite and references therein ; @xcite ) , gaseous disks@xcite , other massive black holes@xcite , and infalling dwarf galaxies@xcite , the binary evolves towards coalescence within hubble time , although whether the binary finally coalesces still remains uncertainty theoretically ( e.g. , @xcite ) and observationally .",
    "then , gravitational radiation emitted prior to coalescence is detectable with the _ laser interferometer space antenna _ ( _ lisa _ ) and pulser timing arrays(ptas ) .",

    ", we investigate riafs triggered by the rapid orbital decay due to emission of gravitational wave .",
    "the letter is organized as follows .",
    "the evolution of binary massive black holes interacting with a massive circumbinary disk are briefly described in section  2 . in section  3 , we derive the possible accretion flows and their luminosities during the gravitational - wave driven evolution .",
    "section  4 is devoted to summary and discussion .",
    "we first briefly describe the evolution of binary massive black holes interacting with a massive circumbinary disk in the framework of coevolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies .",
    "the detailed description can be seen in @xcite .",
    "binary black holes are considered mainly to evolve via three stages @xcite .",
    "firstly , each of black holes sinks independently towards the center of the common gravitational potential due to the dynamical friction with neighboring stars .",
    "when the separation between two black holes becomes less than @xmath8 or so , angular momentum loss by the dynamical friction slows down due to the loss - cone effect and a massive hard binary is formed .",
    "this is the second stage .",
    "the binary hardens at the radius where the kinetic energy per unit mass of the star with the velocity dispersion equals to the binding energy per unit mass of binary black holes@xcite .",
    "its hardening radius is defined as @xmath9(q/(1+q)^2)m_7^{1 - 2/\\beta_2}$ ] , where @xmath10 is the ratio of primary black - hole mass , @xmath11 , to secondary black - hole mass , @xmath12 . here",
    ", it is assumed that the total black - hole mass is tightly correlated with the velocity dispersion : @xmath13 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 shows the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of stars@xcite . finally , the semi - major axis of the binary decreases to the radius at which the gravitational radiation dominates , and then a pair of black holes merge into a single , more massive one .",
    "the circumbinary disk would be formed around hardening of the binary .",
    "the inner edge of circumbinary disk , @xmath17 , is then defined as @xmath18(q/(1+q)^2)m_7^{1 - 2/\\beta_2}(a / a_{\\rm{h}})$ ] , where @xmath19 is the semi - major axis of binary . for simplicity",
    ", the circumbinary disk is assumed to be a steady , axisymmetric , geometrically thin , self - regulated , self - gravitating but non - fragmenting with a keplerian rotation and accretion rate , @xmath20 , with the eddington ratio , @xmath21 , mass - to - energy conversion efficiency , @xmath22 , and shakura - sunyaev type viscosity parameter , @xmath23 .",
    "the circumbinary disk and binary exchanges the energy and angular momentum through the tidal / resonant interaction , which leads to the orbital decay of the binary . on the other hand ,",
    "the gas at the inner edge of circumbinary disk overflows onto the central binary@xcite .",
    "then , an accretion disk is formed around each black hole@xcite .",
    "the mass transfer therefore adds its angular momentum to the binary via accretion disks@xcite . in a steady state ,",
    "the mass transfer rate equals to @xmath24 .",
    "since it is much smaller than the critical transfer rate defined by equation ( 41 ) of @xcite , the additional torque to the binary by the mass transfer can be neglected .",
    "the orbital - decay timescale is then given as @xmath25(q/(1+q)^2)\\eta_{0.1}^{-1}\\epsilon_{0.1}$ ] , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "the total mass supplied to the central binary during the orbital decay is obtained as @xmath28 m_7\\frac{q}{(1+q)^2}. \\label{mdup}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath29 thus gives an upper limit of mass of two accretion disks .",

    "the orbital eccentricity set to be zero , unless otherwise noted , in what follows .",
    "as the binary evolves , the circumbinary disk behaves as the standard disk in the inner region for @xmath34 , whereas the disk still remains to be self - gravitating for @xmath35 . when the orbital - decay timescale is shorter than the viscous timescale measured at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk , the binary is decoupled from the circumbinary disk . for the self - gravitating disk ,",

    "the system consists of only an accretion disk around each black hole .",
    "for simplicity , we focus on the accretion disk around the primary black hole in what follows . assuming that the binary has a circular orbit , the disk outer edge can be defined by the tidal radius as @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 shows the inner roche radius of the primary black hole for @xmath44(e.g . , @xcite ) .",

    "we study radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto each black hole during the gravitational - wave emission driven evolution of binary massive black holes in the framework of coevolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies .",

    "the riaf produces x - ray emissions by the inverse compton scattering and thermal bremsstrahlung , and radio emissions by the synchrotron process . assuming that the magnetic field is a dipole field around a non - rotating black hole and its strength is the equipartition value , the radio emission by the synchrotron process is much more luminous than those of other processes and exhibits step - like variations by a sum of light curve from each component of the binary .",
    "such a precursor implies that each accretion disk are drained because of the high energy radiation emitted by each disk prior to coalescence .",
    "the peak frequency of the synchrotron emission is given by @xmath112 , and @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 are the lorenz factor , electron mass , and pitch angle between the magnetic field and the electron velocity , respectively .",
    "the peak - frequency ratio of the radiation emitted by the disk around the secondary black hole to that of the primary black hole can then be estimated by @xmath116 because the lorenz factor and magnetic field strength depend on the mass ratio .",
