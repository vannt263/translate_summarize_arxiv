    "several astronomical observations at the end of last century suggested that nowadays the universe is in an accelerated regime @xcite .",
    "there are basically three theoretical ways to explain this behavior .",
    "the first one introduces some fluid or scalar field , generally known as dark energy , with a large negative pressure that violates the strong energy condition ( see for a review @xcite ) .",
    "this includes a large number of models , in which the simplest candidate to unify inflation with the current cosmic acceleration is to mix an inflaton field with the cosmological constant @xcite .",
    "the second one consists in going beyond einstein cosmology and considering modified gravity theories such as teleparallelism , @xmath0 gravity or scalar field theories ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "one of the main goals of the works that deal with this kind of modified theories is to unify inflation with the current cosmic acceleration @xcite .",
    "however , one of their basic defaults is that sometimes the proposed models are very involved and contain too many parameters .",
    "the last way opts for considering adiabatic particle production , i.e. , when the specific entropy ( the entropy per particle ) is conserved .",
    "this effect was treated for first time in 1989 by prigogine et al . in @xcite , where the authors successfully insert this macroscopic particle production by adding a negative pressure term into einstein s field equations .",
    "later , a covariant approach was proposed in @xcite , showing that @xcite was a particular case of a more general treatment , i.e. , when the specific entropy is considered non constant .",
    "returning to the adiabatic case , despite being the perfect fluid particles produced isentropic , the increase of its number induces an enlargement of the phase space of the system and , hence , a total entropy production @xcite .",
    "the main interest of this approach is that there are some models leading to a current cosmic acceleration that succeed in matching with the available observational data @xcite and even sometimes it is possible to mimic the @xmath1cdm model @xcite . due to its simplicity",
    ", adiabatic particle production is generally studied in the flat friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker spacetime and only in few works the non flat case is considered @xcite . in particular , in @xcite the authors have studied the dynamics and thermodynamics of a spatially flat universe when the particle production rate is constant . moreover , in @xcite the dynamics of a model with a non constant rate , which leads to an early accelerated epoch that mimics inflation and a current cosmic acceleration , has been studied . even a kinetic formulation for this model has been discussed @xcite .",
    "for this reason , the aim of the present work is to generalize , at spatially curved cosmologies , the results obtained in those papers .",
    "the problem is more involved because in the flat case the dynamics decouples in the sense that it is given by an autonomous first order differential equation of the form @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the hubble parameter , which in general could be solved analytically .",
    "this does not happen when the spacetime is spatially curved because in this case the differential equations for the scale factor , namely @xmath4 , and the hubble parameter do not decouple , obtaining a two dimensional autonomous dynamical system given by @xmath5 , @xmath6 , which in general is impossible to solve analytically and needs to be studied using the mathematical techniques of dynamical systems , the so - called qualitative analysis .",
    "the work is organized as follows . in section",
    "@xmath7 we deduce for a friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker spacetime the equations that model the dynamics of the universe when adiabatic particle production is allowed . section @xmath8 is devoted to the dynamical study of the universe when the particle production rate is constant . here",
    "we see that for a closed universe the bounces are not allowed , in contrast with what happens when there is not particle production .",
    "in fact , instead of a bounce , the scalar curvature diverges when the hubble parameter vanishes .",
    "the remarkable property is that in the expanding phase all the solutions , at very late time , have an effective equation of state parameter that converges to @xmath9 , meaning that all of them depict a universe that at late times enters in a de sitter regime , which could model the current cosmic acceleration .",
    "the case of variable production rate is studied in section @xmath10 , where we basically show that for all the cases there are orbits unifying inflation with the current cosmic acceleration , that is , solutions of the dynamical equations that depict a universe with an early and late time acceleration .",
    "finally , in last section we study the thermodynamical properties of the models studied in the previous sections .",
    "we will use natural units : @xmath11 .",
    "assuming homogeneity and isotropy at large scales , our universe is well described by the so - called friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric , which is given by @xmath12,\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is a scale factor that parametrizes the relative expansion of the universe and the curvature @xmath14 is -1,0 or 1 when we are dealing respectively with an open , flat or closed universe .    under the hypothesis that the flrw spacetime is filled by a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath15 and pressure @xmath16 ,",
    "einstein s field equations lead us to the following friedmann equation @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the hubble parameter .",
    "note that this equation is only a constraint that relates the scale factor , the hubble parameter and the energy density .",
    "thus , in order to obtain the dynamical equations we will use the first principle of thermodynamics @xmath19 , with @xmath20 . therefore , the conservation equation becomes @xmath21 where the total pressure is @xmath22 with @xmath23 , being @xmath24 the pressure of the matter content and @xmath25 the pressure related to the gravitationally induced adiabatic particle production with a creation rate @xmath26 ( see for details @xcite ) .",
    ": equation ( [ cont ] ) could be obtained as follows : particle production is modeled by : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the number of created particles and @xmath29 its density . then , from gibbs equation @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the temperature of the fluid and @xmath32 the specific entropy ( i.e. , the entropy per particle ) , if one assumes that the specific entropy is constant ( particle creation happens under adiabatic condition @xcite ) , one obtains ( [ cont ] ) .    differentiating friedmann equation and using the conservation one ,",
    "we derive the so - called raychaudhuri equation @xmath33    from now on , we suppose that the perfect fluid satisfies a linear equation of state ( eos ) @xmath34 , considering @xmath35 , which models a non - phantom fluid .",
    "the corresponding effective equation of state , using , is given by @xmath36    in order to perform the dynamical analysis in both @xmath37 and @xmath38 cases , it will be useful to change to conformal time @xmath39 , defined by the relation @xmath40 , and to use the conformal hubble parameter @xmath41 where the prime denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time and the dot with respect to the cosmic one .",
    "hence , friedmann equation and raychaudhuri equations will become @xmath42(\\mathcal{h}^2+\\kappa ) .",

    "in this section we will study the case @xmath46 with @xmath47 , whose dynamics was firstly introduced in the seminal paper @xcite and has recently been studied , for the flat case , in @xcite .      for @xmath37",
    ", equation becomes @xmath48 which means that , in this case , the dynamical system decouples and we have a first order autonomous one dimensional dynamical system . therefore , the dynamical analysis is very simple .",
    "we have two fixed points : @xmath49 , which is a repeller , and @xmath50 , which is an attractor , as we show in figure [ rhoh ] :    . ,",
    "height=132 ]    to study the singularities , we note that for large values of @xmath51 equation becomes the same as in classical einstein cosmology , i.e. , @xmath52 .",
    "thus , we have a big bang singularity for @xmath53 and a big crunch singularity in the contracting phase .",
    "now , we will do the same dynamical analysis but in the plane @xmath54 , because for the case @xmath55 it is mandatory to perform it in this plane . from equation ,",
    "we obtain    @xmath56    consequently , the axis @xmath57 is a repeller rect of critical points and , thus , we have no bounces . the axis @xmath58 , which corresponds to @xmath59 , is an attractor in the expanding phase , in the sense that all solutions satisfy @xmath60 , at late times , i.e. , the slope of the curves converges to @xmath61 . when @xmath62 , equation becomes @xmath63 .",
    "therefore , as we have already explained , for cosmic time there is a big bang singularity when @xmath53 and a big crunch in the expanding phase .    in figure [ figk0 ]",
    "we have represented the corresponding phase portraits where we have used colour green for the expanding phase and colour red for the contracting phase .",

    ", the orbit @xmath80 , which corresponds to @xmath81 , plays the role of the curve @xmath82 .",
    "however , since they differ for small values of @xmath83 , there are orbits which cross the curve @xmath59 , which means that for those orbits the universe goes from a phantom to a non - phantom regime .",
    "the phase portrait for @xmath69 is plotted in figure [ k1g23 ] , where we have used the red colour for the contracting phase and the green colour for the expanding phase .",
    "the dotted line is the curve @xmath81 and the dashed line is the curve @xmath59 , which is an attractor in the same sense as in the flat case .",

    "therefore , we have a big bang singularity for those orbits in the expanding phase such that @xmath91 and a big crunch singularity in the contracting phase .    in the same way",
    ", we also observe some sort of singularity at @xmath84 .",
    "it occurs at finite time since @xmath92 does not diverge .",
    "hence , @xmath93 diverges at @xmath84 , which means that the scalar curvature @xmath94 diverges at finite time .    for @xmath95",
    ", we also have another orbit , that we have represented in a dotted line , which plays the role of the curve @xmath59 , i.e , @xmath96 ( dashed line ) . the other black line refers to @xmath97 , where @xmath64 . and",

    "we only need to verify that they occur for a finite cosmic time .",

    "anyway , in the expanding phase all the orbits satisfy @xmath101 , and as in the flat case , when @xmath67 there are orbits depicting , at early times , a decelerating universe that accelerates at late times .",
    "analogously as in the closed case , we obtain for @xmath102 the equation @xmath103 , which could be integrated obtaining orbits of the form @xmath104 .",

    "we only need to verify that they occur for a finite cosmic time . with the same argument used in the closed case ,",
    "the big bang and big crunch singularity occur at a finite time because in these cases @xmath110 and , thus , it satisfies asymptotically the same dynamics as for @xmath37 .    in the phase portrait",

    "the orbits @xmath111 ( i.e. @xmath112 ) are repellers , while in the expanding phase all the orbits satisfy as in the cases @xmath113 that @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath115 .",
    "in @xcite , the authors considered a variable production rate given by @xmath116 and studied the different possible values of the constants .",
    "it is discussed that for some particular cases it is possible to depict , for the flat case , a non - singular universe in cosmic time , i.e. , defined for all @xmath117 , with an early accelerated period ( inflation ) , that decelerates after the end of inflation and finally enters in another accelerated regime which could mimic the current cosmic acceleration . in this section",
    "we are going to consider one of this cases , which results when @xmath118 , @xmath47 and @xmath119 .",

    "in the case @xmath136 , there are orbits that depict a universe accelerating at early times and late times , with a deceleration period between these accelerated phases .",

    "we also point out that these orbits have no singularities in finite cosmic time , since at early times @xmath138 and , thus , point @xmath139 in the plane @xmath54 is not reached in a finite time , which corresponds to the so - called _ little bang _",
    "singularity @xcite , named in analogy to the _ little rip _ @xcite .    however , we see that the background is not past - complete analogously to the analysis done in @xcite .",
    "this follows from the fact that the maximum affine parameter @xmath140 is finite .",

    ", we verify that the maximum proper time @xmath148 will also be finite .",
    "hence , in the system of reference that a massive particle moving along a time - like geodesic is at rest , the singularity ( the divergence of the energy density ) occurs at finite proper time @xcite , meaning that the universe is not past - complete .",
    "note finally that , as has been pointed out in for the first time in the seminal paper @xcite , this past incompleteness is a an universal property of the scenarios that contains an early inflationary period .",
    "the dynamical system associated to this case is : @xmath149    in this case , @xmath57 is a repeller axis of singularities and , hence , we have no bounce .",
    "since for @xmath150 the behavior is the same as in the flat case , the time needed to reach @xmath150 will diverge again . the phase portrait for the different cases , which we have already described for the flat case , are the following ones :    ) in the plane @xmath54 with @xmath134 ( left ) , @xmath137 ( center ) or @xmath136 ( right).,height=207 ]    all orbits in the contracting phase contain a finite time future singularity because near @xmath57 the dynamical equation becomes @xmath151 , which shows that the derivative of @xmath83 diverges ( and , thus , the scalar curvature diverges ) .",
    "moreover , it is not difficult to see that the time to reach @xmath57 is finite .    in the expanding phase",
    ", @xmath124 is an attractor .",
    "some orbits have a past singularity in which @xmath152 diverges , as in the contracting phase . when @xmath153 , analogously as in the flat case , we also have orbits without singularities in finite cosmic time which could depict the unification of the early inflationary period with the late time cosmic acceleration .",
    "the corresponding dynamical system is : @xmath154    as in the closed universe , for @xmath150 we have no singularities in cosmic time .",
    "and the axis @xmath111 represents solutions of the dynamical system .",

    "therefore , @xmath3 diverges at finite cosmic time , but this does no mean that there is a singularity .",
    "effectively , near @xmath156 the dynamical equation ( [ x ] ) becomes @xmath157 whose general solution is @xmath158 .",
    "then , since @xmath159 and near @xmath156 the scalar curvature is approximately @xmath160 , we can conclude that both quantities are finite at @xmath156 .",
    "finally , once again , in the expanding phase @xmath124 is an attractor and there are orbits that could be candidates to depict our universe .",
