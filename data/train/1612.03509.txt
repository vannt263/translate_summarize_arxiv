    "a series of experimental studies on jet - quenching from rhic[1 - 6 ] and lhc[7 ] reflect the energy loss of fast partons while traversing the hot and dense medium .",
    "the parton energy loss in high energy collisions has attracted attention from both the nuclear and particle physics communities during the last two decades . however , any consensus in the baseline for the parton energy loss has been lacking .",
    "a solid understanding of the nuclear modification of particle spectra in cold nuclear matter is fundamentally important for investigating the fast parton propagation in hot and dense medium and further quantifying the properties of the qgp created in these heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the drell - yan reaction[8 ] in hadron - nucleus collisions can provide the possibility of probing the parton propagation through nuclear matter , with the produced lepton pair carrying away the desired information on the parton after it has travelled in the nucleus .",
    "as the lepton pair in the final state does not interact strongly with partons in the nuclei , only initial - state interactions are important in the drell - yan scattering .",
    "the drell - yan process can be considered as a very clean probe for the energy loss effect of incoming quark in cold nuclear matter .",
    "a series of experimental data on the drell - yan differential cross section ratios were presented by na3[9 ] and na10[10 ] collaborations from cern , and e772[11 ] and e866[12 ] collaborations from fermilab .",
    "the data on the differential cross section ratio as a function of the quark momentum fraction can cancel the most uncertainties regarding the lepton pair production , and avoid the influence of the qcd next - to - leading order correction[13 ] .",
    "many theoretical phenomenological models were proposed to describe the incoming quark energy loss in nuclear drell - yan process[14 - 19 ] .",
    "the best value of energy loss obtained by their independent analysis of the drell - yan experimental data was strongly dependent on the used nuclear parton distribution functions and the assumption for the average path length of the incident quark .    in our preceding papers[20 - 23 ] ,",
    "the effect of energy loss in drell - yan process is discussed and models are given to incorporate them in the calculation of drell - yan yields .",
    "it is found that the energy loss effect of incoming quark can suppress evidently the differential cross sections versus the quark momentum fraction , and the mean value of quark energy loss obtained by hkm nuclear parton distribution functions[24 ] is larger than that by using hkn07[25 ] , nds[26 ] and eps09[27 ] parameterizations which directly reflects the deviation between hkm nuclear corrects to sea quark distribution and other sets .",
    "it is noticeable that hkm proposed the nuclear parton distributions that were determined only by fitting the experimental data from @xmath5-a deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) without the data about drell - yan reaction .",
    "it is worth to mention that the mean energy loss employed in our preceding calculations wold be considered very simplistic in hot and dense matter , and the fluctuations of the path that a quark takes through the medium has not yet been considered .",
    "it is accepted that at least the probability @xmath6 of energy loss @xmath7 given a path @xmath8 with averaged over geometry is relevant quantity . in this paper , by means of the salgado - wiedemann ( sw ) quenching weights[28 ] , and the analytic parameterizations of quenching weights[29 ] based on baier , et al .",
    "( bdmps ) formalism[30 ] , the leading - order computations for nuclear drell - yan differential cross section ration as a function of the quark momentum fraction are performed with the nuclear geometry effect in drell - yan dimuon production .",
    "the transport coefficient @xmath9 of the incoming quark energy loss in cold nuclear matter is extracted with a global analysis of the na3[9 ] ( incident proton energy @xmath3 gev and target - quark momentum fraction @xmath10 from 0.074 to 0.366 ) and e866[12 ] ( @xmath11 gev and @xmath12 ) nuclear drell - yan experimental data .",
    "we desire that our results and discussion in this work can facilitate the theoretical research on the microscopic dynamics of medium - induced parton energy loss .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii , the theoretical framework of our study is introduced .",
    "section iii is devoted to the results and discussion .",
    "finally , a summary is presented .",
    "at the leading order in perturbation theory , the lepton pair production differential cross section in hadron - nucleus collisions is obtained from the convolution of differential partonic cross section @xmath13 with the quark distributions in the beam and in the target : @xmath14.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the momentum fraction carried by the projectile ( respectively target ) parton , @xmath16 is the fine structure constant , @xmath17 is the center of mass energy of the hadronic collision , @xmath18 is the charge of the quark with flavor @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the invariant mass of a lepton pair , the sum is carried out over the light flavor ( @xmath21 ) , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are respectively the quark and anti - quark distribution function in the hadron ( nucleon in the nucleus a ) .    in the hadron - induced drell - yan reaction on nucleus ,",
    "when the incoming quark propagates through the nuclear medium , it suffers multiple scattering on the surrounding nucleon and gluon radiation .",
    "the induced gluon bremsstrahlung effectively reduces the incoming quark energy . the energy loss ( @xmath7 ) of the incoming quark results in a change in its momentum fraction prior to the collision , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the incident hadron energy . as a consequence",
    ", the projectile parton distribution function should be evaluated at @xmath26 .    with considering the incoming quark energy loss in the nuclear medium , the drell - yan differential cross section in hadron - nucleus collisions can be expressed as : @xmath27.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the characteristic gluon frequency @xmath28 , and",
    "@xmath29 denotes the probability that an incoming quark suffers an energy loss @xmath7 from the quark radiating gluons . in the calculation ,",
    "the energy scale @xmath30 depends on the path length @xmath8 covered by the incoming quark in the nuclear medium , and is determined by the transport coefficient @xmath9 adjusted to the data .",
    "considering the fluctuations of the path @xmath8 travelled by the incoming quark across the target , the energy loss probability distribution @xmath29 needs to be averaged over geometry .",
    "the nuclear geometry is described by the nuclear density distribution @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the coordinate along the direction of the incoming quark and @xmath33 is the impact parameter .",
    "the center of the target nucleus lies at @xmath34 . with the assumption that the annihilation of a quark - antiquark pair into a virtual photon is located at @xmath35 , the incident quark at @xmath32",
    "will travel the path length @xmath36 , along a direction with impact parameter @xmath33 . then with the nuclear geometry effect in drell - yan dimuon production , the nuclear drell - yan differential cross section should be written as : @xmath37.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the nuclear density profile @xmath31 is normalized to unity .",
    "in order to extract the value of the transport coefficient @xmath9 , we give a phenomenological analysis at leading order for the nuclear drell - yan differential cross section ratio : @xmath38 for the na3[9 ] and e866[12 ] experimental data ( 87 points ) . by means of the cern subroutine minuit[31 ] , the transport coefficient @xmath9 is obtained by minimizing @xmath39 .",
    "one standard deviation of the optimum parameter correspond to an increase of @xmath39 by 1 unit from its minimum @xmath40 . in our calculation",

    "it is shown that the global fit of all data gives @xmath0 gev@xmath1/fm with @xmath46 . as can be seen from table 1 ,",
    "considering the incoming quark energy loss effect and the nuclear geometry effect in drell - yan dimuon production , the theoretical results are in good agreement with the experimental data , and especially the agreement of calculations with na3[9 ] experimental data has a significant improvement ( with @xmath47 for na3@xmath48 data and @xmath49 for na3@xmath10 data ) . in our previous study [ 23 ] , @xmath45 extracted from the na3@xmath50 data is 1.69 ( respectively 2.53 ) by means of the mean energy loss model and without the fluctuations of the path .    to demonstrate intuitively the energy loss effect of an incoming quark on the nuclear drell - yan cross section ratio , the solid curves in fig.1 , fig.2 , fig.3 and fig.4 are our numeric results which are compared with the corresponding experimental data . in fig.1",
    ", it is necessary to note that na3 collaboration provided the negative pion incident drell - yan cross section ratio @xmath51 as a function of parton momentum fraction .",
    "it is shown that the theoretical results with the incoming quark energy loss effect and the nuclear geometry effect in drell - yan dimuon production have good agreement with the experimental data . as can be seen from fig.1 that the influence due to the incoming quark energy loss on the na3 nuclear drell - yan different cross section ratio ( @xmath52 ) decreases with the increase of @xmath48 ( approximately from @xmath53 to @xmath54 in the range @xmath55 ) and then becomes greater ( approximately from @xmath54 to @xmath56 in the range @xmath57 ) .",
    "as for the ratio @xmath58 , the influence induced by the quark energy loss is also firstly decreases with the increase of @xmath10 ( approximately from @xmath59 to @xmath60 in the range @xmath61 ) , and then increase approximately from @xmath60 to @xmath62 in the range @xmath63 . from fig.2 , fig.3 and fig.4 , it is found that the incoming quark energy loss effect on the fermilab e866 nuclear drell - yan different cross section ratio becomes greater with the increase of quark momentum fraction ( @xmath48 ) in the beam hadron ( for example , the suppression of @xmath64 for @xmath65 is approximately from @xmath66 to @xmath67 in the range @xmath68 ) , and decreases gradually with the increase of quark momentum fraction ( @xmath10 ) in the target nucleus ( such as the suppression of @xmath69 is approximately from @xmath70 to @xmath71 in the range @xmath72 ) .",
