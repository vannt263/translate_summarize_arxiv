    "as the nielsen - ninomiya theorem @xcite states , we necessarily meet the difficulty of so - called fermion doubling problem when we formulate fermion fields on a lattice . in practical calculations , wilson fermions",
    "@xcite have been widely used , where an additional term which vanishes in the naive continuum limit is introduced at the expense of the chiral symmetry .",
    "an alternative scheme was proposed by kogut and susskind @xcite . in this scheme the chiral symmetry is maintained as discrete one and doubler fermions are regarded as fermions in other species . in @xmath0 dimensions ,",
    "the kogut - susskind ( ks ) formalism describes a theory with @xmath1 degenerate quark flavors ( @xmath2 components ) .",
    "recently it has been shown that lattice fermionic actions satisfying the ginsparg - wilson relation @xcite may provide a solution of the chirality problem @xcite . in these attempts",
    "the modified chiral symmetry operator is used in stead of @xmath3 .",
    "the actions are local in the sense that the fermionic matrix are bounded by @xmath4 .",
    "however , it has been proved that actions with the ginsparg - wilson relation can not be `` ultralocal '' @xcite . from the practical point of view",
    ", the ultralocality ( the couplings drop to zero beyond a finite number of lattice spacings ) is also important . thus ultralocal fermionic actions with better features than , for example",
    ", the ks action is awaited , though not a final solution of the chirality problem .    in the recent papers @xcite",
    ", we proposed a new type of fermionic action on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice .",
    "the action is ultralocal and constructed so that fermion fields satisfy the bosonic type of dispersion relation . in this sense there are no extra poles in the propagator .",
    "we found that the minimal number of fermion components , dimensions of the spinor space , is @xmath5 in the minkowski case and @xmath6 in the euclidean case , which should be compared with @xmath2 of the ks fermion .",
    "furthermore our action has the discrete chiral symmetry as well .",
    "it is much of interest to investigate the numerical feasibility of our new fermionic action . when dynamical fermions are included , the property of fermion determinants is crucial in numerical calculations .",
    "for example , some methods proposed to treat fermionic freedoms rely on reality or positivity of the fermion determinants @xcite .",
    "in this paper we report the analytical and numerical results on the fermion determinants of our new action in @xmath7 dimensions .",
    "our main concern is on u(1 ) gauge group , but some results on su(n ) gauge group are also presented . in the case of u(1 )",
    "gauge group , we will see that calculations with specific conditions for temporal link variables are stable and satisfactory though results without the conditions are unstable .",
    "the reason why we need those conditions will be discussed in detail .    in sec.2 , we recapitulate our formalism for later convenience .",
    "the analytical and numerical results on fermion determinants will be presented in sec.3 , which is followed by the summary .",
    "in the previous paper @xcite , we proposed a new fermionic action on the euclidean lattice .",
    "though the action respects the discrete chiral symmetry like one in the ks action , fermion fields in this action have @xmath6 components in @xmath0 dimensions , which should be compared with @xmath2 in the case of ks fermions . in this section",
    "we briefly sketch our formalism for later convenience .",
    "the action can be written with the fermion matrix @xmath8 as @xmath9 where the summation is over lattice points and spinor indices , and our fermion matrix is defined by @xmath10 here @xmath11 is the euclidean time evolution operator and @xmath12 is the unit shift operator defined as @xmath13    we required that the propagator has no extra poles and found that @xmath11 has the form @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ratio of the temporal lattice constant to the spatial one and @xmath16 s and @xmath17 s , which are matrices with respect to spinor indices , should satisfy the following algebra : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 run from @xmath21 to @xmath22 .",
    "the matrix @xmath23 is positive definite for any positive @xmath15 , therefore @xmath16 s and @xmath17 s can be assumed hermitian , @xmath24 the matrices @xmath16 s and @xmath17 s are written in terms of the clifford algebra @xmath25 as @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are certain real constants .",
    "the dimension of the irreducible representation for @xmath29 s is @xmath6 and accordingly @xmath30 has @xmath6 components .",
    "now we give some useful properties of the time evolution operator @xmath11 .",
    "we can see immediately that @xmath31 as @xmath16 s and @xmath17 s are hermitian .",
    "since the inverse of @xmath11 is given by @xmath32 we find that @xmath11 is related to its inverse as : @xmath33 where @xmath34    the interaction of the fermion with gauge fields is introduced by replacing the unit shift operators by covariant ones : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the unit vector along the @xmath37th direction , and @xmath38 is a link variable connecting sites @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the fermion matrix eq.([eq : fermi_mat0 ] ) and the time evolution operator eq.([eq : u_e0 ] ) become @xmath41 and @xmath42    with gauge fields coupled to the fermions , however , eqs.([eq : u_inv0 ] ) and ( [ eq : gug0 ] ) do not hold any more in arbitrary dimensions except for @xmath7 dimensions . in @xmath7 dimensions these relations are @xmath43 and @xmath44 which are used in the next section .",
    "in this section we show the analytical and numerical results of our fermion determinant in the @xmath7-dimensional case .",
    "first , we investigate the determinant of the unit shift operator @xmath45 in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "let us denote the link variables by @xmath46 which live on the links connecting two neighboring lattice sites @xmath39 and @xmath47 .",
    "now we consider the case of the abelian gauge group u(1 ) , and they can be written in the form @xmath48 where @xmath49 is restricted to the compact domain [ 0 , 2@xmath50 ) .",
    "then , @xmath45 can be constructed as a @xmath51 matrix where @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the size of the lattice in the euclidean time and the spatial directions , respectively , and @xmath54 is the number of spinor components .",
    "@xmath45 is diagonal in the spatial and spinor space and consists of block @xmath55 matrices @xmath56 belonging to the euclidean time space .",
    "thus we can write the determinant of @xmath45 as follows : @xmath57 where @xmath56 for each @xmath58 appear @xmath54 times as @xmath45 is unity in the spinor space .",
    "the determinant of @xmath56 is easily calculated by noticing its matrix form : @xmath59 we used the anti - periodic boundary condition for the time direction , which is represented by a negative sign in the lower - left corner of the matrix @xmath60 .    as a result , in @xmath0 dimensions we find @xmath61^{n_s } \\nonumber \\\\          & = & \\exp \\left\\ { i n_s \\sum_t \\sum_{{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$ } } } }              \\theta_0(t,{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ x$ } } } ) \\right\\ }",
    "= e^{i\\alpha } ,      \\label{eq : dets0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the angular variable @xmath62 is defined by @xmath63    from now we assume @xmath64 and show that the determinant of the euclidean time evolution operator @xmath65 is unity . by eq.([eq : gug1 ] ) we easily find @xmath66 . since @xmath16 s and @xmath17 s obey eq.([eq : xygamma ] ) and in the limit @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 is equal to @xmath21 at @xmath70 . from the continuity of @xmath69 with respect to @xmath71",
    ", we conclude @xmath72 in the @xmath7-dimensional case .    collecting the above results , the relations ( [ eq : gug1 ] ) and ( [ eq : det_u_e_1 ] ) , and the hermiticity of @xmath65",
    ", we can obtain a relation on the phase of our fermion determinant in @xmath7 dimensions as follows : @xmath73 since the number of components of our fermion is @xmath74 and consequently the fermion matrix @xmath75 always has an even number of dimensions , we get @xmath76    accordingly in the case of @xmath7 dimensions with u(1 ) gauge fields , our fermion determinant is real under the condition @xmath77 where @xmath62 is defined in eq.([eq : alpha_res ] ) . the condition specified by eq.([eq : a - res ] ) will be called `` gt - condition '' in this paper , where the temporal link variables are globally constrained as @xmath78 and on the infinite lattice the condition is achieved by a gauge transformation .",
    "we also define `` t - condition '' as @xmath79 , which corresponds to the temporal gauge condition on the infinite lattice .    at a glance",
    ", it seems strange that the determinant has @xmath62-dependence , because @xmath62 can be gauged away .",
    "however , this is not true for a finite lattice , since all gauge transformations on the infinite lattice are not allowed on a finite lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus , the dependence comes from finiteness of the lattice .",
    "for example , @xmath80 is invariant under any gauge transformation on a finite lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the temporal gauge condition is certainly a consistent gauge in an infinite system , but not in a finite system .",
    "however , this restriction is just an artifact arising when we try to approximate an infinite system by a finite one .",
    "we could think in the following way .",
    "given an infinite system , we impose the temporal gauge condition , which is legitimate .",
    "then we take an finite sub - system to approximate the original total system .",
    "the difference is due to size and boundary effects and would disappear in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the same is also true for the gt - condition .",
    "it should be noted that the fermion determinant is invariant under gauge transformations on a finite lattice , but the determinant does depend on our `` gauge conditions '' : the t- or the gt - condition .",
    "now , we will give the numerical results in the @xmath7-dimensional u(1 ) gauge theory with our fermion action .",
    "in the following numerical simulations link variables are updated by the metropolis method and determinants are calculated by the lu decomposition .",
    "so there are no systematic errors in the determinants . the way to generate a sequence of configurations in the monte carlo computation is as follows . in the t - condition , we fix @xmath81 everywhere . after this , all temporal link variables are not changed and we only update the link variables of spatial direction using the metropolis method . in the gt - condition , we prepare a configuration satisfying @xmath78 . then a temporal link variable @xmath82 is replaced by @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is a random number between @xmath85 and @xmath50 . at the same time another temporal link variable , which is chosen randomly , is multiplied by @xmath86 . and",
    "we use the above configuration as the trial one in a metropolis acceptance test .",
    "it can be shown that this procedure satisfies the micro - reversibility requirement , and therefore also the detailed balance condition .",
    "in fig.[fig01](a ) - [ fig01](c ) we show the distribution of the fermion determinants in the complex plane for some @xmath87 .",
    "the statistics is @xmath88 thermalizations and @xmath88 measurements . in fig.[fig01](a ) , no conditions are imposed on temporal link variables .",
    "fig.[fig01](b ) is the result in the t - condition . in fig.[fig01](c ) , the gt - condition with @xmath89 is imposed , namely the condition @xmath90 in eq.([eq : alpha_res ] ) is always kept in monte carlo updates . the distribution in fig.[fig01](a )",
    "has a doughnut - like structure with a center around the origin , so that we can expect that the convergence for any observation is very poor . on the other hand , fig.[fig01](b ) and [ fig01](c ) show that the determinants in the t- and the gt - condition are real as expected and also positive .",
    "the distribution in the imaginary direction is due to numerical errors ( note the difference in the scales of real and imaginary parts ) .",
    "the positivity of determinants is important from the numerical point of view and will be discussed later .    to test the convergence in the above three types of conditions , we measured the expectation value of a plaquette value as a function of @xmath87 using the following formula : @xmath91 here @xmath92 is the usual action for link fields , and @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 stand for @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively .    in fig.[fig02 ]",
    "we can see that the expectation values in the t- and the gt - condition display gentle curves , while one without any conditions is spiky especially for small @xmath87 . here , the plotted points are the average over @xmath99 results , each of which is obtained by @xmath88 monte carlo iterations at each @xmath87 . and the error bars are evaluated by using the standard deviation of the @xmath99 results . if the error bars are not displayed , they are not visible at this scale .",
    "the poorness of the convergence without any conditions can be traced back to the behavior of the denominator in eq.([eq : pla ] ) .",
    "the expectation value @xmath100 not only takes complex values but also suddenly increases or decreases during sampling .",
    "fig.[fig03 ] shows the absolute value of the averaged fermion determinant as a function of the update iterations for each condition .",
    "we find that the convergence in the case of no conditions is ill while in the cases of other two conditions very fine .",
    "generally the more iterations are expected to improve the convergence . without any conditions , however , this is not the case since the expectation value of the determinant must be in the empty hole of a doughnut - like structure in fig.[fig01](a ) .",
    "thus it is difficult to improve the convergence for any expectation value within a reasonable number of iterations .    now what is the difference between the t- and the gt - condition ?",
    "we expect that the gt - condition is superior to the t - condition since the former condition is much weaker condition than the latter . to see this , we show in figs.[fig04](a ) and [ fig04](b ) the averaged plaquette value in the pure u(1 ) gauge theory as a function of @xmath87 for three types of conditions .",
    "we find the line without any conditions and one with the gt - condition are very close to each other , but the line calculated in the t - condition is slightly upper than those .",
    "as expected , this difference comes from the size effects in each condition and obviously tends to decrease as the lattice size becomes larger .",
    "thus we conclude that the gt - condition has better feature on a finite lattice : the fermion determinant is positive and the finite - size effects are smaller .      before discussing the positivity of the fermion determinant , we study the spectrum of @xmath75 .",
    "first , we introduce a discrete rotational symmetry in the complex plane for eigenvalues of @xmath101 . defining @xmath102 , we find @xmath103 this relation implies that if @xmath104 is some eigenvalue of @xmath101 , then @xmath105 is also its eigenvalue .",
    "next using the following relation @xmath106 we rewrite the eigenvalue equation @xmath107 into the form : @xmath108 accordingly , from eqs.([eq : det_s0due ] ) and ( [ eq : det_s0due_inv ] ) if @xmath104 is some eigenvalue of @xmath101 , then @xmath109 is also its eigenvalue .",
    "let us look at the numerical results of the spectrum of our fermion matrix @xmath110 in the @xmath7-dimensional u(1 ) theory .",
    "figs.[fig05](a ) - [ fig05](c ) display the spectrum in the case of no conditions , the t- and gt - condition , respectively . from the figures we confirm the two properties of the spectrum discussed above for each condition .",
    "the spectrum in the gt - condition is so similar to the one with no conditions that one could nt distinguish them at a glance .",
    "it is interesting that the determinant is real only in the former case .",
    "now , using above two properties for @xmath111 , we discuss the positivity of our fermion determinant . we will give a plausible reason for the positivity not a complete proof .",
    "first we write the determinant as follows : @xmath112 in eq.([eq : det_from_eigen ] ) , the denominator must be real , since the numerator is positive and @xmath113 is real under the t- or the gt - condition as shown before .",
    "the denominator is a continuous function of the background configuration and furthermore it is never vanished , because @xmath101 has always an inverse .",
    "once the denominator is positive for some background configuration , it keeps on having a positive value for any configuration , if one configuration can be transformed continuously to the other within the t- or the gt - condition .",
    "next , we show that our fermion determinant is positive when all link variables are set unity . in this case",
    "can be easily diagonalized in the momentum space .",
    "the eigenvalues are expressed by the eigenvalues @xmath115 of @xmath11 as @xmath116 therefore @xmath117 is clearly positive , as @xmath115 can be shown positive .",
    "the configuration with all link variables unity clearly satisfies the t- and the gt - condition .",
    "this seems to complete our proof for the positivity of the determinant .",
    "it should be noticed that we might be faced with configurations where some @xmath104 with @xmath118 is not degenerated in spite of the symmetry @xmath104 and @xmath109 . in this case",
    "the relation eq.([eq : det_from_eigen ] ) does not hold and our proof fails .",
    "however , such configurations are very hard to happen .      when the gauge group is su(n )",
    ", we can also make similar discussion to the u(1 ) gauge group case and find the positivity of our fermion determinant . in this case , from eq.([eq : detq ] ) we immediately see @xmath119 so we find @xmath120 without any conditions .",
    "consequently , the determinant of our fermion matrix is always real in the case of su(n ) gauge fields .",
    "and we find that our fermion determinant is positive in the @xmath7-dimensional su(n ) , since the two symmetries of the spectrum of @xmath75 discussed above are also satisfied .",
    "in fact we can confirm the symmetries from the spectra shown in figs.[fig06](a ) and [ fig06](b ) for su(2 ) and su(3 ) , respectively . and , in figs.[fig07](a ) and [ fig07](b )",
    ", we display the numerical results for the distribution of our fermion determinant in the @xmath7-dimensional su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge theories .",
    "the results show that fermion determinants are real and positive in both cases .",
    "we conclude that our fermion determinant @xmath121 in ( 1 + 1)-dimensions is real and positive for u(1 ) gauge group under the t- or the gt - condition and for su(n ) gauge group without any conditions , though we have only a plausible reason for the positivity .",
    "when we applied our new action without any conditions to u(1 ) gauge theory on a lattice , we were faced with the problem of convergence in monte carlo simulation . in this note , we showed that we could avoid this problem by imposing the t- or the gt - condition . in order to make this situation clear , as an example , we study the propagator of the fermi field , @xmath122 integrating in eq.([propa ] ) with respect to @xmath123 and @xmath124 we have @xmath125 we introduce new variables @xmath126 and @xmath127 instead of link variables @xmath128 , @xmath129 and using the following equation @xmath130 we get @xmath131 where the tilde represents replacing @xmath132 by @xmath127 .",
    "the phase of determinant @xmath133 takes any value between @xmath134 and @xmath135 as is shown in fig.[fig01](a ) .",
    "the summation of @xmath136 over a sequence @xmath137 which is chosen at random are canceled out accidentally , then the denominator of eq.([propa3 ] ) becomes very small .",
    "this is the origin of unstable behavior in monte carlo simulation . indeed in sec.3 , under the t- or the gt - condition which ensures that the variable @xmath126 is fixed zero , we proved the determinant @xmath138 in the @xmath7-dimensional lattice to be real for all configurations of link variables and to be positive for most ones .",
    "we have another reason for fixing @xmath126 , namely , imposing some condition like the t- or the gt - condition .",
    "since the integrand of the numerator in eq.([propa3 ] ) is equal to the cofactor of matrix @xmath139 whose elements are linear functions of @xmath140 , it is a polynomial of @xmath140 .",
    "after we integrate it with respect to @xmath126 , all terms of this polynomial vanish besides constant terms .",
    "for the denominator of eq.([propa3 ] ) we can say the same thing as the above , thus we have @xmath141 which is an undesired result .",
    "contrarily , if we choose some condition , like the t- or the gt - condition , we may avoid this trouble .",
    "when we try applying this fermion to the su(n ) lattice gauge theory , we can expect that there is no necessity for imposing some condition because the element like @xmath140 does not belong to the group su(n ) .",
    "in fact , it is shown that the fermion determinant is real for all configurations and that it is positive for most configurations . and",
    "the numerical simulation for su(2 ) and su(3 ) gauge theory shows that the fermion determinants are real and positive .",
    "we will discuss the application of our fermions to su(n ) lattice gauge theory in higher dimensions elsewhere .",
