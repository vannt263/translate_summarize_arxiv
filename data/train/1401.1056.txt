    "the field equations of gravity , _ einstein _ ( 1915,1916 ) @xcite , constitute a set of @xmath0 coupled nonlinear partial differential equations which relate the metric tensor @xmath1 of curved space - time to the stress - energy tensor of matter @xmath2 . due to",
    "the inherited mathematical difficulties of solving these field equations in closed form , exact and physically well interpretable solutions of general theory of relativity are on rare occasions @xcite .",
    "the most well - known examples for the case of massive isolated sources are the metric of a spherically symmetric massive body derived by _ schwarzschild _",
    "( 1916 ) @xcite , the solution for a spherically symmetric and electrically charged body found by _ reissner _ ( 1916 ) @xcite and _ nordstrm _ ( 1918 ) @xcite , and the metric for rotating bodies obtained by _ kerr _ ( 1963 ) @xcite .",
    "however , for more realistic scenarios , like an accelerated body , an asymmetric body , or a n - body system , exact solutions for the metric field are far out of reach or even do not exist . therefore , approximative approaches of general relativity are essential for further progress in the theory of gravity .",
    "an important approximative approach is the theory of linearized gravity , where in harmonic gauge the coupled field equations of _ einstein s _ theory are simplified to a set of decoupled inhomogeneous wave equations for each of the @xmath0 components of the metric tensor , _",

    "the mathematical structure of linearized field equations ( [ introduction_1 ] ) resembles the field equations of classical electrodynamics in lorentz gauge , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the four - potential and @xmath14 the four - current , but with the addition that in classical electrodynamics the space - time is minkowskian , while the space - time in linearized gravity is in fact curved .",
    "especially , the green functions of both field equations are formally the same , and the harmonic coordinates @xmath11 are treated as though they were cartesian coordinates in flat minkowski space @xcite .",
    "hence , like in classical electrodynamics , a solution of ( [ introduction_1 ] ) is given by , _",

    "the so - called advanced solution , where @xmath20 in ( [ introduction_2 ] ) is replaced by @xmath21 , is usually be regarded unphysical because it violates the causality condition and will not be considered here .",
    "the multipole decomposition of ( [ introduction_2 ] ) in terms of spherical harmonics is a highly effective approach to further analyze this solution . that tool of multipole expansion has originally been applied a long time ago in classical electrodynamics @xcite and later been transformed into the case of linearized gravity . in this respect ,",
    "a bench mark was the investigation of _ campbell _ , _ macek _ @xmath22 _ morgan _ ( 1977 ) @xcite who have worked out a multipole decomposition of the scalar ( gravitational potential ) , vectorial ( electrodynamical four - potential ) and tensorial ( linearized gravity ) field outside the matter source in terms of spherical harmonics .",
    "however , the use of so - called cartesian symmetric and tracefree ( stf ) multipole moments @xcite instead of spherical harmonics simplifies considerably the calculations in gravitational physics @xcite : the mathematical relations and expressions in gravitational theory become simpler , the numerical algorithms can be performed more efficiently , and the whole approach of gravitational theory becomes more elegant . by",
    "now , the stf multipole expansion , in post - newtonian approximation ( `` weak - field slow - motion approximation '' , i.e. @xmath23 exact to order @xmath24 , @xmath25 exact to order @xmath26 ) and post - minkowskian approximation ( `` weak - field approximation '' , i.e. @xmath27 exact to order @xmath28 ) , has been established as an important tool in linearized gravity and has found a wide range of applications : in celestial mechanics @xcite , in the theory of gravitational waves @xcite , and in the theory of light propagation in curved space - time @xcite which is a fundamental aspect of relativistic astrometry .",
    "meanwhile , the stf multipole expansion in linearized gravity has a remarkable history and encompasses some decades of period of time .",
    "let us mention some important contributions which are considered as cornerstones in the theory of multipole expansion ; further historical facts can be found , for instance , in box @xmath29 in @xcite , introductory sections in @xcite and @xcite , and in section @xmath30 in @xcite .",

( 8.13 ) in @xcite ) . however , the multipoles ( eqs .",
