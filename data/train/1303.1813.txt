    "v405  and is an active binary system , which was first studied by @xcite , who analyzed spectroscopy and photometric observations in @xmath1 and @xmath2 passbands , and found a rotation period of 0.465 days , a grazing eclipse , and strong h@xmath3 emission .",
    "they also concluded that  according to the h@xmath3 region  both components are active .",
    "@xcite studied photometry in @xmath4 passbands , and spectroscopic measurements .",
    "the authors found that the primary component has radius that is too large for its mass , while the secondary component fits quite well to the mass  radius relation .",
    "their results were later confirmed by @xcite , who found very similar radius values using an independent spectroscopic method based on doppler imaging .",
    "figure [ fig : lc ] shows photometric measurements in @xmath2 passband covering about 1800 days .",
    "we used the same iterative modeling method described in @xcite to fit the new observations .",
    "the basic idea is to create an initial binary model using phoebe @xcite based on the radial velocity data of @xcite and the light curve , which rudimentarily describes the effects of binarity .",
    "this model is subtracted from the observed light curve , resulting in a dataset , where the changes are caused by the spottedness .",
    "this data is then modeled by spotmodel @xcite . by subtracting this model from the observed light curve we get a dataset , where the changes are due to the binarity ( eclipse and proximity effects ) , which is fed again to phoebe .",
    "the previous steps are then repeated , until the combined binary and spot model describes the observed light curve satisfactorily .",
    "the bottom four panels of figure [ fig : lc ] show different parts of the observations together with the combined binary and spot model .",
    "we found that all the previous and newly observed light curves can be described by the same binary model that was found in @xcite confirming the results of that paper , namely , that the radius of the primary component is much larger than expected , while the secondary fits well to the mass  radius relation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mr ] ) .",
    "there are more known systems that show similarly a larger radius for the primary component , but the discrepancy is the largest in the case of v405  and .",
    "we do not know , what is behind this behavior .",
    "@xcite showed that very strong magnetic field ( which manifests itself in activity features ) increases stellar radii , although not to this extent .",
    "@xcite showed that starspots in certain cases can cause systematic deviations of a few percent in the determined stellar radii during modeling , but the difference in the case of v405  and is higher than that , too .",
    "the components have different structures : the secondary has a mass of @xmath5 , thus it is probably fully convective .",
    "the primary has a mass of @xmath6 , so it has a radiative core and a convective envelope .",
    "if our results and the similar values of @xcite are correct , the study and modeling of similar active systems , with components of different structures could be very interesting in the future .",
    "light curve showing the signal of the rotational modulation / orbital period at 0.465 days , and a peak at about 300 days , a result of an activity cycle ( top ) , and the spectral window ( bottom ) .",
    "right : @xmath2 light curve pre - whitened with the rotational modulation , phased with the period of the activity cycle . ]",
    "we studied the @xmath2 light curve by discrete fourier analysis using mufran @xcite .",
    "the resulting fourier spectrum and spectral window is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : cyc ] ) .",
    "the spectrum shows two main features .",
    "one can be associated with the rotational / orbital modulation at the frequency corresponding to the period of 0.465 days .",
    "the other one is a longer cycle , with a period of about 300 days .",
    "this is most probably a result of a stellar activity cycle , which is similar to the 11 year - long cycle of the sun . as a result of the ultrafast rotation",
    ", the length of the stellar activity cycle is also very short ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the cycle found on v405  and is one of the shortest cycles ever found ( cf .",

    "this work was also supported by the `` lendlet-2009 '' , and `` lendlet-2012 '' young researchers programs of the hungarian academy of sciences , and by the human mb08c 81013 grant of the mag zrt .",
