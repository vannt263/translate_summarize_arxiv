    "transiting hot jupiters are a class of exoplanets which are very suitable for detailed study of their physical and orbital parameters .",
    "they are gas - giant planets with short orbital periods ( mass @xmath5 and period @xmath6d ) , and many of them are now known orbiting bright stars .",
    "their relatively large sizes usually give deep transits ( typically 0.53.5% ) which are well - suited for observation and analysis .",
    "another particular advantage of transiting hot jupiters is their suitability for _ transmission spectroscopy _ , which can yield constraints on the chemical composition at the terminator of their atmospheres from transit depth measurements at multiple wavelengths .",
    "depending on the temperature of the planet s atmosphere , it is possible to investigate the presence of several molecules ( e.g.  h@xmath7o , co , co@xmath7 and ch@xmath8 ) at infrared ( ir ) wavelengths .",
    "the blue region of the visual wavelength range is also important to study , as it allows constraints to be placed on the presence of rayleigh scattering or particular atomic absorption features ( e.g.  na ) .",
    "there has been significant progress in this field in the last few years , and many exoplanets have been observed using transmission spectroscopy .",
    "the resulting transmission spectra show an unexpectedly diversity of the atmospheres of hot jupiters , in particular the amount of cloud at observable pressure levels @xcite .    whilst most of these studies were performed at ir wavelengths , a small set of planets",
    "have also been studied at optical wavelengths from space with the hubble and the spitzer telescopes ( i.e.  hd189733b : @xcite ; hd209458b : @xcite ; hat - p-1b : @xcite ; hat - p-12b : @xcite ; wasp-6b : @xcite ; wasp-12b : @xcite ; wasp-17b : @xcite ; wasp-19b : @xcite ; wasp-31b : @xcite ; wasp-39b : @xcite ; ) and from large ground - based telescopes such as the very large telescope ( gj1214b : @xcite ; wasp-19b : @xcite ) , the gran telescopio canarias ( hat - p-19b : @xcite ; wasp-43b : @xcite ) , gemini ( hat - p-32 : @xcite ; wasp-12 : @xcite ; wasp-29 : @xcite ) and magellan ( hat - p-26 : @xcite ; tres-3 : @xcite ; wasp-6 : @xcite ) .",
    "an alternative approach for probing planetary atmospheres is that of _ transmission photometry _ , which has a lower spectral resolution but is suitable for ground - based telescopes with smaller apertures and exoplanets orbiting faint stars .",
    "moreover , photometric observations are much less affected by telluric contamination than spectroscopic ones .    in this context",
    ", we are carrying out a large program of transit observations of the known hot jupiters with an array of medium - size telescopes in both hemispheres @xcite .",
    "in particular , we are using grond ( gamma - ray burst optical and near - infrared detector ) , an imaging camera able obtain light curves in four optical and three near - ir passbands simultaneously .",
    "these are used to improve measurements of the physical properties of the planets and their host stars , and to look for transit - depth variations as a function of wavelength in the optical wavelength region .    in order to have a comprehensive picture",
    ", we are investigating both inflated and compact hot jupiters . due to their density",
    ", the latter should be not optimal targets for transmission - spectrum studies .",
    "however , depending on the equilibrium temperature , opacity and chemical composition of their atmospheres , mie scattering , rayleigh scattering and molecular opacity could still cause strong variation of the radius of such planets , especially if we compare measurements at the wavelength region @xmath9 nm with those at @xmath10 nm .",
    "previous studies with grond have shown different atmospheric properties : we obtained transmission photometry consistent with flat spectra for several systems ( wasp-23b : @xcite ; wasp-43b : @xcite ; wasp-80b : @xcite ; wasp-67b : @xcite ) , and larger planetary radii at bluer wavelengths for two objects ( qatar-2b : @xcite ; wasp-103 : @xcite ) .",
    "these two latter studies were based on multiple datasets from grond and demonstrate that repeated transit observations produce more precise and robust results .",
    "it is interesting to note the large variation that was found in the dense and moderately cold planet qatar-2b .    in the present work",
    ", we study the transiting planetary system wasp-36 @xcite .",
    "this contains a relatively dense hot jupiter , wasp-36b , with mass @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 .",
    "the density of wasp-36b is therefore similar to that of qatar-2b , but its temperature is higher since it orbits a hotter ( @xmath13k ) and metal - poor ( [ fe / h]@xmath14 ) g2v star , wasp-36a , every 1.54days .",
    "the high temperature and low densities imply that the planet atmosphere would be rich of molecules consisting of hydrogen and sulfur , which are able to absorb stellar light at blue - optical wavelengths .",
    "an occultation event of wasp-36b was observed in the @xmath15 band by @xcite .",
    "these authors found that the orbit is consistent with circular and that the occultation is @xmath16% deep , corresponding to a @xmath15-band brightness temperature of @xmath17k .",
    "this is similar to the planet s equilibrium temperature ( @xmath18k ) and means that strong absorbers are expected to be present in its atmosphere @xcite .",
    "@xcite has recently presented a new photometric light curve of a wasp-36b transit , which was used to redetermine the parametrs of the planetary system .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "the observations and data reduction are both described in sect.[sec_2 ] , while the analysis of the data is presented in sect.[sec_3 ] .",
    "the refinement of the orbital ephemerides is given in sect.[sec_3 ] .",
    "in sect.[sec_4 ] we revise the main physical properties of the planetary system . in sect.[sec_5 ] we investigate the variation of the planetary radius as function of wavelength and , finally , we summarize our results in sect.[sec_6 ] .             but sorted according to filter . ]",
    "four transits by wasp-36b were observed with grond , which is mounted on the mpg2.2 m telescope at eso la silla ( table[tab : obs ] ) .",
    "grond is a seven - channel imaging camera that was built for rapid observations of gamma - ray burst afterglows @xcite , but is also well - suited for transit observations .",
    "grond can be used to observe simultaneously in four optical passbands ( similar to sloan @xmath0 ) and three near - ir bands ( @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) .",
    "the optical light is collected by back - illuminated @xmath22 pixel e2v ccds , with a field of view of 5.4arcmin @xmath23 5.4arcmin at a scale of 0.158arcsecpixel@xmath24 .",
    "the near - ir channels use @xmath25 pixel rockwell hawaii-1 arrays , with a field of view of 10arcmin @xmath23 10arcmin at 0.6arcsecpixel@xmath24 .",
    "the photometric precision of the near - ir arms is significantly worse than the optical ones @xcite , so these data will be not considered in this work .",
    "another transit by wasp-36b was remotely observed in december 2014 through a cousins @xmath26 filter with the zeiss 1.23 m telescope at the calar alto observatory .",
    "the telescope is equipped with a @xmath27 pixel dlr - mkiii camera , with a field of view of 21.5arcmin @xmath23 21.5arcmin at a plate scale of 0.32arcsecpixel@xmath24 .",
    "the ccd was operated without binning , but windowed to shorten the readout time . during all the observations",
    "the two telescopes were autoguided and defocussed in order to improve the photometric precision of the data .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "being strongly irradiated by their parent stars , the spectra of hot jupiters are expected to show characteristic absorption features at optical wavelengths .",
    "some of the predicted features include sodium ( @xmath28 nm ) , potassium ( @xmath29 nm ) , water vapour ( @xmath30 nm ) , and rayleigh scattering at bluer wavelengths",
    ". however , the variety of hot - jupiter transmission spectra suggests a great deal of variation in chemistry and atmospheric dynamics . while @xcite suggested that a physical dichotomy exists between , essentially , insulated and non - insulated and well - mixed atmospheres ( based primarily upon the level of irradiation received by the planet ) the species of clouds driving the insulation has been disputed ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the ability of grond to observe simultaneously in four optical bands makes it a useful tool to detect absorption features and thus probe the atmospheric composition of the planet , by measuring the ratio of the radii in different bands and comparing these values with synthetic spectra . following the approach of @xcite",
    ", we calculated the ratio of the radii in each passband with the other photometric parameters fixed to the best - fit values .",
    "this yielded a set of @xmath31 values which are directly comparable and whose errorbars exclude common sources of uncertainty .",
    "the errorbars were calculated using 10000 monte carlo simulations .",
    "we found @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( fig.[fig : radius_variation ] ) .",
    "a significant variation of the planetary radius was found between the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 bands . the variation is roughly @xmath36 pressure scale heights",
    ", where @xmath37 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath38 the mean molecular weight . ] and is significant at beyond the 5@xmath39 level . a similar variation has been found in other cases ( e.g.  hd189733b , @xcite ; hat - p-5b , @xcite ; gj3470b , @xcite ; qatar-2b , @xcite ) and could be a sign of rayleigh - scattering processes in the planetary atmosphere .",
    "we also considered the possibility that unocculted starspots , which have a stronger effect at bluer wavelengths , can cause a larger radius of wasp-36b in the blue band than that predicted by theoretical models .",
    "we estimated the effect of unocculted starspots on the transmission spectrum of wasp-36b using the methodology described by @xcite .",
    "the correction to the transit depth for unocculted spots is plotted in fig.[fig : correction ] , assuming a total dimming of 1% at a reference wavelength of 600 nm @xcite for different starspot temperatures .",
    "such corrections have been applied to the values of @xmath31 reported in fig.[fig : radius_variation ] for each of the four optical band , but the difference between the blue and the red bands remains substantial .    in order to investigate this variation , we have compared the observed transmission spectrum of wasp-36b with sets of synthetic transmission spectra .",
    "these have been obtained by using two different codes , _ petitcode _ and vstar .",
    "these two codes and the various models are described in the next two subsections .",
    "values from the grond observations .",
    "the vertical bars represent the relative uncertainties and the horizontal bars show the fwhm transmission of the passbands .",
    "the black points with dashed errorbars refer to the same measurements after correction for possible starspot activity .",
    "synthetic spectra for wasp-36b , obtained with the _ petitcode _ , are shown as coloured lines .",
    "the green line is a standard prediction , the grey line shows the case in which na and k are excluded , the blue line is as the grey one but with rayleigh scattering increased by a factor of 1000 , and the red line shows the case in which we consider the opacity contribution due to tio and vo .",
    "offsets are applied to the models to provide the best fit to our radius measurements .",
    "the atmospheres were computed for two different planetary metallicities : [ fe / h]@xmath40 ( _ top panel _ ) and [ fe / h]@xmath41 ( _ bottom panel _ ) .",
    "coloured boxes represent the predicted values for the three models integrated over the passbands of the observations .",
    "transmission curves of the grond filters are shown in the bottom panel .",
    "the size of ten atmospheric pressure scale heights ( 10@xmath20 ) is shown on the right of the plot.,width=332 ]          for calculating synthetic transmission spectra we used _",
    "petitcode _ for self - consistent modelling of one - dimensional atmospheric structures and spectra @xcite .",
    "_ petitcode _ has recently been extended for deriving transmission spectra by directly calculating the transmission through planetary annuli as probed during transits .",
    "an effective planetary radius is then calculated from the combined transmission of all annuli .",
    "the transmission spectra include rayleigh scattering of h@xmath7 and he , using the cross - sections reported in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for verification purposes of our implementation of the transmission - spectrum calculations",
    ", we compared to the one - dimensional transmission spectra given in figs .  2 and 3 in @xcite , which yielded excellent agreement .",
    "we further added molecular cross - sections for tio and vo , using an updated line list based on @xcite , available on the author s website for tio and a line list obtained from betrand plez ( private communication ) for vo .",
    "the partition functions were obtained from uffe gre jrgensen s website for tio and betrand plez ( private communication ) for vo , which is based on an updated partition function by @xcite ; see also @xcite .",
    "as pressure broadening information was not available , we approximated the broadening coefficients using equation ( 15 ) in @xcite .",
    "for this set of models we use an extended list of condensable species , comprising mgsio@xmath42 , mg@xmath7sio@xmath8 , sic , fe , al@xmath7o@xmath42 , na@xmath7s , kcl , h@xmath7o , tio and vo .",
    "the chemical equilibrium abundances for the gas and condensed phase species in _ petitcode _ are now calculated by a new chemical equilibrium code , which reliably works for temperatures between @xmath43  k and has been tested for consistency with the cea code @xcite . for the development of this code we made use of the methods and equations outlined in the cea manual @xcite .    using the values",
    "reported in table[tab : finalparameters ] for the parameters of wasp-36b and its host star , we calculated self - consistent atmospheric structures .",
    "the stellar irradiation was calculated assuming a global average . as the flux is received by the planet with a cross - section of @xmath44 , but is distributed over an area of @xmath45 , this corresponds to a flux dilution factor of @xmath46 when compared to the flux at the substellar point .",
    "we computed atmospheres for two different planetary metallicities : [ fe / h]@xmath47 , which is close to the value reported for the host star ( @xmath48 , @xcite ) , and [ fe / h]@xmath49 , which corresponds to the planet being ten times more enriched than its host star . for both metallicities we calculated two atmospheres : in the first case we did not consider the opacities of tio and vo in the atmospheric structure calculation , whereas in the second case we did consider such opacity contributions .",
    "for the cases in which tio and vo were not considered , we took the resulting two pressure - temperature structures and calculated three different transmission spectra to investigate the following three cases :    * nominal case , using the same opacities as were used for obtaining the atmospheric structure ; * case without na and k opacity ; * case without na and k opacity and a h@xmath7 rayleigh cross - section enhanced by a factor 1000 in order to mimic strong rayleigh - like scatterers .    in total we considered eight cases : @xmath50 cases for the atmospheric structures calculated without tio and vo , plus two cases for the atmospheric structures including tio and vo .",
    "they are depicted in fig.[fig : radius_variation ] , and it is clear that none of the options explored above was able to reproduce the data , especially their steep slope .",
    "the slope of the transit spectrum is given by ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the power law dependency of the opacity with respect to wavelength , @xmath53 , and @xmath20 is the atmospheric scale height . the surface gravity of wasp-36b is well constrained by its mass and radius measurements , and @xmath54 should have a value close to 2.3amu if one assumes an atmosphere dominated by h@xmath7 and he @xcite . for wasp-36b",
    "the slope obtained for the synthetic transmission spectra is too small by a factor of @xmath55 when compared to the data .",
    "the minimum temperature in our atmospheric structure is @xmath56k .",
    "rayleigh scattering ( @xmath57 ) would thus require a very high atmospheric temperature , of at least 4000 k , in order to be consistent with the data .",
    "we created a second set of models of the atmosphere of wasp-36b with the versatile software for the transfer of atmospheric radiation ( vstar ; @xcite ) .",
    "vstar is a robust line - by - line radiative transfer solver , which has been successfully applied to the atmospheres of cool stars , solar system planets , and hot jupiters @xcite . for wasp 36b",
    ", the rayleigh and mie scattering capabilities were used for attempting to model the dramatic increase with radius at bluer wavelengths .",
    "rayleigh scattering from a h - he atmosphere alone is not able to describe the change in radius for wasp 36b that we have measured .",
    "a mie scattering haze of small particles can be introduced to compensate for a large portion of the short wavelength absorption .",
    "such a scattering haze is introduced within the radiative transfer model and is dependent upon the optical depth per horizontal layer , the refractive indices of the scattering material across relevant wavelengths , and the radii of the particles themselves .",
    "scattering atmospheric particles with radii ranging from 0.01 to 0.1@xmath58 m were tested .",
    "the distribution in sizes for a given median radius is described by a power law distribution with an effective variance of @xmath59 m @xcite .",
    "approximately half the slope can be derived with particle sizes around @xmath60 m .",
    "changing the distribution of these particles vertically throughout the atmosphere can shape the mie scattering contribution . in systems with sufficient data ,",
    "this can be fit to provide information about the cloud and haze distribution on the planet .",
    "the opaqueness of the layers set by the optical depth per height effects the spectrum particularly for upper layers where the transmission path length is longer .",
    "too great an optical depth at a given layer will create a flattened spectrum towards longer wavelengths masking molecular features . because of the shift in the relative radius from blue to red wavelengths for wasp 36b it is unlikely that a very opaque cloud is present high in the atmosphere .    in fig.[fig :",
    "radius_variation2 ] transmission spectral curves without molecular features are shown .",
    "the variation in the radius is due solely to scattering by molecular species or clouds and hazes .",
    "the various lines correspond to different values of the optical depth in the upper atmosphere over 1000 km .",
    "the model with h - he rayleigh scattering alone ( dashed cyan line ) does not compensate for the steep rise in absorption towards blue wavelengths .",
    "the optical depth distributions shown are illustrative of the effects of clouds and hazes .",
    "blue scattering haze in a highly extended atmosphere could possibly produce the large scale height distribution of radii .",
    "layer - by - layer calculations for varying optical depth were trialled , but we found that they can not compensate for the unusually steep absorption .",
    "the scattering properties were based upon those of enstatite , which is a species likely responsible for the blue light scattering in the hot jupiter hd189733b @xcite .",
    "other species with weaker attenuation at blue wavelengths , such as some sulphurous molecular species , may better compensate for the blue light absorption in the planet s transit .",
    "it is possible that along with strong mie and rayleigh scattering  perhaps from an extended scattering haze  that absorption in blue light from a molecular species is also present .",
    "relatively few species absorb in blue visible light wavelengths .",
    "@xcite showed that sulphanyl ( hs ) has an absorption spectrum which is effective at short wavelengths , and they derived the absorption cross section for the species at some uv and blue wavelengths .",
    "unfortunately no information on the species for longer wavelengths is currently available and we could not calculate the corresponding radiative transfer in the atmosphere of wasp-36b using the absorption cross section with vstar .    .",
    "synthetic spectra for wasp-36b , obtained with the vstar code ( see sect.[vstar ] ) , are shown as coloured lines .",
    "the different lines correspond to varying optical depth with height , indicative of the mie scattering particle distribution .",
    "pure rayleigh scattering without the effects of clouds is shown with the dashed cyan curve .",
    "no molecular absorption is included in these models.,width=332 ]",
    "we have presented new broad - band photometric observations of five transit events in the wasp-36 planetary system , which is composed of a relatively young g2v star and a massive hot jupiter .",
    "four transits were observed with the grond instrument , which supports observations in four optical bands simultaneously ; another single - band transit observation was obtained with the caha 1.23 m telescope . we fitted the light curves using the jktebop code , and revised the orbital ephemeris and physical parameters of the system .",
    "our results are consistent with and more precise than previous measurements .",
    "we searched for a variation of the measured radius of wasp-36b as a function of wavelength , by determining the ratio of the planet s radius to that of the star in the four grond passbands .",
    "our data clearly show an increase of the planetary radius in the bluer bands .",
    "the variation between @xmath3 and @xmath4 is more than @xmath61 with a significance level larger than 5@xmath39 .",
    "we compared the multi - band measurements with the predictions of several theoretical models of planetary atmospheres .",
    "synthetic spectra were computed using _",
    "petitcode _ for self - consistent atmospheric structures and two opposite planetary metallicities ; various cases with strong absorbers ( tio and vo ) , without na and k opacity and with strong rayleigh - like scattering process were investigated .",
    "furthermore , the vstar code was also utilised to produce atmospheric models in which the planetary - radius variation is only due to scattering by molecular species or clouds and hazes .",
    "different models were presented varying the optical depth of the atmosphere . however , in no case was our models were able to reproduce the observed spectrum . neither the presence of gaseous oxides nor strong rayleigh scattering seems to be the cause of the steep slope in the transmission observations .",
    "the existence of an absorber which reproduces the observed transmission photometry due to its line opacities is therefore more likely , but the exact nature and origin of such an absorber is speculative",
    ".    in conclusion , the mechanism responsible for the steep slope in the transmission spectrum of wasp-36b remains difficult to constrain .",
    "further observations of wasp-36b transits are suggested , especially with a photometer in the @xmath62 band or with a spectrograph able to cover a large spectral range at optical wavelengths .",
    "this paper is based on observations collected with the mpg 2.2 m telescope located at the eso observatory in la silla , chile , and with the zeiss 1.23 m telescope at the centro astronmico hispano alemn ( caha ) at calar alto , spain .",

    "<S> we present broad - band photometry of five transits in the planetary system wasp-36 , totaling 17 high - precision light curves . </S>",
    "<S> four of the transits were simultaneously observed in four passbands ( @xmath0 ) , using the telescope - defocussing technique , and achieving scatters of less than @xmath1mmag per observation . </S>",
    "<S> we used these data to improve the measured orbital and physical properties of the system , and obtain an optical transmission spectrum of the planet . </S>",
    "<S> we measured a decreasing radius from bluer to redder passbands with a confidence level of more than @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the radius variation is roughly 11 pressure scale heights between the @xmath3 and the @xmath4 bands . </S>",
    "<S> this is too strong to be rayleigh scattering in the planetary atmosphere , and implies the presence of a species which absorbs strongly at bluer wavelengths .    </S>",
