    "the packings that we study are formed by starting with an initial finite configuration @xmath0 of circles in the plane with disjoint interiors , and such that the gaps between circles are curvilinear triangles , as in figure  [ fig configurations ] .",

    "therefore , @xmath631 and @xmath632    now @xmath633",
    "@xmath634 @xmath635    combining , , , we see that @xmath636 which only depend on @xmath178 and @xmath14 , and for any arbitrary small number @xmath637 , @xmath638 , such that when @xmath639 ,    @xmath640    we also have @xmath641 therefore , @xmath642 , @xmath643 as a result , as @xmath159 , we obtain @xmath644    since @xmath645 is a convex combination of @xmath646 , if we let @xmath647 , @xmath648 and use the continuity of @xmath649 ( as follows from ) , we obtain @xmath650      any bounded circle packing can be written as @xmath568 for some generalized ford packing @xmath2 .",
    "the only issue we need to deal with is @xmath7 , if an arc @xmath276 in @xmath569 contain @xmath651 , the argument in the proof of theorem [ transferprinciple ] does not directly apply .",
    "however , this is easily solved by precomposing @xmath178 with some @xmath652 , so that @xmath653 is a bounded arc , and @xmath654 for some @xmath655 and any @xmath656",
    ". then we can apply theorem [ transferprinciple ] .",
    "we compute the gap distribution function @xmath41 for three examples : the classical apollonian packing , where we start with a configuration of four mutually tangent circles , whose tangency graph is the tetrahedron ; the apollonian-3 packing in which one starts with three mutually tangent circles , and in either of the curvilinear triangles formed by three mutually tangent circles we pack three more circles , forming a sextuple whose tangency graph is the octahedron ; and the apollonian-9 packing introduced in @xcite where the initial configuration consists of 12 circles , with the icosahedron as its tangency graph .",
    "we explain the procedure used in the computations : according to theorem  [ thm : formula for f ] , the gap distribution @xmath41 is given in terms of a sum of functions @xmath657 over ( unordered ) pairs of distinct circles @xmath658 of areas of regions @xmath659 in the @xmath376 plane , explicitly described in    [ sec : determining ] .",
    "so for instance in the case of the apollonian-9 packing , there are @xmath660 such pairs .",
    "we are able to cut down on the computational effort involved by using conformal invariance , once we note that the packings we study below enjoy more symmetries than a generic packing .",
    "according to theorem  [ transferprinciple ] , if there is some @xmath37 which preserves @xmath17 and @xmath12 ( note that @xmath661 only depends on @xmath17 , not on all of @xmath2 ) , and takes the pair of circles @xmath662 in @xmath122 to another pair @xmath663 in @xmath122 , then @xmath664 .    in each of these packings",
    ", there exists a group @xmath665 which is larger than @xmath44 that also acts on this given packing . in each of the three examples presented ,",
    "the bigger group @xmath666 is one of the hecke triangle groups @xmath667 , which is the group of mbius transformations generated by the inversion @xmath668 and the translation @xmath669 , where @xmath670 : @xmath671 for @xmath672 we recover the modular group : @xmath673 .",
    "for @xmath674 the groups @xmath667 are non - arithmetic .    in all three cases ,",
    "we show that @xmath675 is a normal subgroup of the appropriate @xmath667 . in the first example of the classical ford packing , @xmath676 which acts transitively on the ford circles @xmath17 . in the second example , of the apollonian-3 packing , @xmath677 . in the third example , the apollonian-9 packing , @xmath678 .",
    "it is a simple check that in each of these cases , the generators @xmath679 send circles in @xmath99 to some circles in @xmath17 .",
    "so if we show @xmath679 normalizes @xmath44 , then it follows that @xmath679 permutes the circles in @xmath680 .",
    "we further show that @xmath667 acts transitively on pairs of tangent circles in @xmath99 for @xmath681 , and on pairs of disjoint circles for @xmath682 .",
    "hence by conformal invariance of the components @xmath657 , this gives an expression for @xmath41 as a sum of areas of two regions for @xmath682 ( only one for @xmath672 ) .",
    "these regions are in turn expressed as a finite union of certain subregions @xmath683 . for each subregion @xmath684 ,",
    "the first two equations give the conditions @xmath685 , and the other equations except the last one gives the condition @xmath686 , where @xmath76 exhausts circles in @xmath122 such that @xmath687 is in between @xmath412 and @xmath413 .",
    "the last quadratic equation corresponds to conditions or , capturing relative gap information .",
    "the areas of these regions can be explicitly computed in elementary terms , but the resulting formulae are too long to record .",
    "instead we display plots of the density of the normalized gaps ( the derivative of @xmath301 ) .",
    "+              the resulting packing @xmath2 is a classical apollonian packing , generated by inscribing a unique circle into every curvilinear triangle produced by the four mutually tangent circles and repeating .",
    "the circles @xmath17 tangent to the real line are precisely the classical ford circles @xmath689 , having as points of tangency the farey sequence @xmath690 .",
    "the gap distribution of the farey sequence was found by hall @xcite , and we carry out the computation here as a warm - up to illustrate our method .",
    "the group @xmath112 is generated by the three reflections @xmath693 so @xmath44 generated by @xmath694 and @xmath695 , which are the generators of the principal congruence subgroup @xmath696 which is a normal subgroup of @xmath697 .",
    "any pair of circles from @xmath698 are _ conformally equivalent _ , in the sense that there exists some @xmath699 which preserves the packing and maps @xmath172 , @xmath173 to this given pair of circles : indeed , @xmath700 therefore we have @xmath701 .",
    "and so by theorem  [ thm : formula for f ] , @xmath702 and it remains to compute the area of @xmath703 .",
    "we compute the region @xmath704 using , , .",
    "a direct computation gives @xmath705 the distance between @xmath706 and @xmath707 is @xmath708 . when @xmath709 , @xmath710 will be mapped by @xmath362 to some circle in between @xmath711 and @xmath712 by observation  [ inbetween ] , and the corresponding region is @xmath713      note that @xmath717 and @xmath718 are symmetric about the @xmath419-axis , so we only need to calculate one area .",
    "therefore , by theorem  [ thm : formula for f ] , @xmath719 the density function @xmath720 of the normalized gaps ( the derivative of @xmath41 ) is given in figure  [ fig : classicapp3density ] .",
    "our next example was discovered by guettler and mallows @xcite , in which one starts with three mutually tangent circles , and in either of the curvilinear triangles formed by three mutually tangent circles we pack three more circles , forming a sextuple @xmath0 , see figure  [ ap3ford ] .",
    "the base circle is @xmath42 and the circles of @xmath0 tangent to it are @xmath721              to see that @xmath44 is normal in @xmath726 , we check that the conjugates of the generators of @xmath44 by the generators @xmath201 , @xmath730 of @xmath726 still lie in @xmath44 : @xmath731 @xmath732 @xmath733 @xmath734 @xmath735    there are @xmath736 ( unordered ) pairs of circles from @xmath122 : four pairs of tangent circles @xmath737 , @xmath738 , @xmath739 , @xmath740 , and two pairs of disjoint circles @xmath741 .",
    "each of these cases gives one equivalence class under the action of @xmath726 : @xmath742 and @xmath743 hence from formula @xmath744      first we consider @xmath745 : the distance between @xmath749 and @xmath750 is @xmath708 .",
