    "the irac observations of m31 were taken as part of _ spitzer _ general observer program 3126 in 2005 january and august .",
    "fifteen astronomical observation requests ( aors ) were used to map a region approximately @xmath0 ( chosen to match the _",
    "spitzer_/mips observations made as part of program i d 99 ) , with an extension to the nw to include ngc  205 .",
    "the central @xmath4 was covered by three aors , each having two 12-second frames per position .",
    "the outer regions were covered by two aors each with two dithered 30-second frames per position .",
    "this mapping strategy ensured that observations of each position in the galaxy were separated by at least 2.5 hours , allowing efficient asteroid rejection in data processing .",
    "the complete dataset consists of 3000 individual images in each of the irac channels .",
    "data reduction began with the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) produced by versions 11 ( for the january data ) or 12 ( the august data ) of the _ spitzer _ science center ( ssc ) pipeline .",
    "a ` delta dark ' offset correction was applied to the 12-second 5.8  @xmath1 m  frames to correct for the first - frame effect , followed by use of the ` artifact corrector ' software developed by s. carey , which attempts to remove the electronic effects caused by bright stars .",
    "the remaining processing steps were carried out using the `` irac_proc '' software with the 2005 september 5 version of the ssc mopex package . the ` overlap correction ' necessary to make the sky background consistent between frames was computed and applied .",
    "median - combined mosaics of the full dataset were created , then projected into the reference frame of each input bcd image to create ` source maps ' .",
    "these source maps were used as the input ` uncertainty images ' for creating the final photometric mosaics  this step prevents the outlier rejection used by mopex from rejecting pixels in bright sources and thereby biasing the photometry .",
    "the final mosaics were created with a pixel scale of 086 , sub - sampling the native irac pixel scale by a factor of @xmath5 to better sample the point spread function ( fwhm @xmath6 ) .",
    "the sky background was removed using the iraf task imsurfit to model the background as a polynomial surface sampled by ` blank sky ' regions near the edge of the mosaics .",
    "after subtraction , the mean image counts in small areas within these regions were computed , and the standard deviation of these means used to estimate the photometric uncertainties due to the background .    the final step in mosaic production was photometric calibration .",
    "although calibration of point source photometry varies slightly over the irac arrays field of view @xcite , we did not correct for this since doing so would have corrupted the extended emission .",
    "the calibration of irac is known to differ between point and extended sources , particularly at 5.8 and 8  @xmath1 m  where a significant fraction of point - source light is scattered on scales comparable to the array size .",
    "we used the results of recent work by t. jarrett ( priv .",
    "comm . ) to correct from point to extended source calibration in the m31 mosaics by multiplying the images by ( 0.91 , 0.94 , 0.66 , 0.74 ) in the four irac bands , respectively [ these values differ slightly from those given in @xcite ] .",
    "the standard deviations of the background levels are about 0.04  mjy  sr@xmath3  in all bands except 5.8  @xmath1 m , where the background subtraction was more difficult , and the noise was 0.1  mjy  sr@xmath3(1@xmath7 ) .",

    "the final of mosaics are shown in figure  [ m31_bw ] .",
    "as with other recent works on irac observations of nearby galaxies we assumed that the 3.6  @xmath1 m  emission is purely due to stars , and used this to construct maps of the ` non - stellar ' emission at 5.8 and 8  @xmath1 m . the stellar emission at the two wavelengths is assumed to correspond to 0.399 and 0.232 @xmath10 the 3.6  @xmath1 m  emission @xcite .",

    "the 8  @xmath1 m  image  particularly the non - stellar version  looks extremely similar to the 24  @xmath1 m  image presented by @xcite , showing the same split on the southwest side of the 10  kpc ring that @xcite attribute to interactions with m32 .",
    "the ` hot spots ' seen near the nucleus at 160  @xmath1 m  are also prominent in the 8  @xmath1 m  non - stellar image , where they coincide with the ends of spiral arms .",
    "disk images @xmath12 were extracted from the mosaics and used to derive irac surface brightness profiles of m31 .",
    "peaks of bright stars , a 1-radius region around m32 , and image regions with no coverage were all masked from the profile measurements .",
    "profiles were measured using two methods : making 20-wide cuts along the disk major and minor axes using the iraf task pvector , and fitting elliptical isophotes to the images using the ellipse task . because ellipse can be unstable at low surface brightnesses , the isophote shape parameters ( ellipticity , position angle , center ) were constrained to be constant beyond the edge of the visible disk at semi - major axes @xmath13 .",
    "the isophote fit at this distance has an ellipticity ( @xmath14 ) of 0.73 and position angle of 38 .",
    "profiles in the three longer - wavelength bands were measured on the ellipses fit to the 3.6  @xmath1 m  image , so that colors could be measured at the same spatial locations .    the relative prominence of the m31 disk and bulge in the four irac bands is reflected in the major and minor axis profiles , shown in figure  [ fig_axes ] . out to a semi - major axis of @xmath15  ( approximately the edge of m31 s bulge ) , all four bands have very similar profiles .",
    "beyond 400 , the 5.8  @xmath1 m  and 8.0  @xmath1m - band profiles decline more slowly and show more variability due to the clumpy nature of the dust emission .",
    "the 10  kpc ring is visible in all of the major - axis profiles ; the 8.0  @xmath1 m  profile in particular appears highly asymmetric because of the split in the ring .",
    "the minor axis profiles are smoother because they sample mainly the bulge .",
    "both major and minor axis profiles are quite similar in shape to the optical profiles presented by @xcite , indicating that dust extinction does not have a major effect on the optical profiles . the nucleus of m31 is smaller than the irac psf , and does not separate from the bulge emission in the radial profile .",
    "the color profiles of m31 shown in figure  [ fig_colors ] also depict the disk / bulge separation .",

    "the disk dominates the light and the colors become redder , particularly at the location of the 10 kpc ring . comparing the 3.6  @xmath1 m  profile to the @xmath17-band optical profile of @xcite",

    "table  [ tab_mag ] gives integrated flux densities and magnitudes of m31 as measured in the largest elliptical isophote ( @xmath2018 ) .",
    "the uncertainties in these values include the effects of background variation and a 10% uncertainty in the absolute extended source calibration .",

    "a model light distribution consisting of an @xmath26 bulge and exponential disk were fit to the 3.6  @xmath1 m  semi - major axis surface brightness ( sb ) profile .",
    "the structural parameters fitted to the disk are sensitive to inclusion of the ring at semi - major axis lengths @xmath27  arcsec , while the bulge effective radius is sensitive to the inner fitting cutoff due to deviations from the idealized @xmath26 model at @xmath28  arcsec ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the sky value for the image was determined at isophotes roughly corresponding to @xmath29 disk scale lengths . as there is still",
    "some galaxy emission at this radius , our sky value is likely over - estimated and is probably the dominant cause of the significant reduction in the sb at @xmath30  arcsec ( smaller , but still significant , errors will be present in the profile at @xmath31  arcsec ) .",
    "we chose the fitting regions of @xmath32 and @xmath33  arcsec to minimize these effects , and for consistency with previous work .",
    "the resulting model has ( bulge , disk ) half - light semi - major axis lengths of @xmath34  arcmin , average ellipticities near to those scale lengths of @xmath35 , total magnitudes @xmath36 , and rms of @xmath37  mag .",
    "the corresponding circularized effective radii are @xmath38  arcmin .",
    "this disk major axis scale length of @xmath39  kpc compares well with the longest wavelength ( @xmath40-band ) value of 5.9  kpc measured by @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the bulge effective radius of @xmath41  kpc to disk scale length place m31 on the upper envelope of local spiral galaxies @xcite . the fitted bulge and disk models",
    "have a flux ratio @xmath42 .",
    "this value is biased high relative to the true ratio , however , because the bulge model is too bright at @xmath28  arcsec and the disk model is too faint at the location of the 10  kpc ring .",
    "@xcite calculate a similar value in the @xmath40-band .",
    "the model - fitting allows an estimate of m31 s total magnitude at 3.6  @xmath1 m  through extrapolation of the disk model to infinite radius .",
    "the magnitude within @xmath31  mag is 0.19  mag , the extrapolated disk from 2.5 scale lengths to infinity adds an additional 0.38  mag , and the sky subtraction errors on the sb profile within this isophote result in an additional 0.15  mag .",
    "the implied total magnitude of m31 is therefore @xmath43  mag .",
    "we have chosen not to quote this model - dependent value in table  1 for consistency with previous work and our measurements at other wavelengths , but it is consistent with the measurement in the 18 isophote given there when similar corrections are applied .",
    "the errors on the total magnitude of m31 are dominated by the systematic error of sky subtraction on this large galaxy , and less so on the extrapolation of the disk emission .",
    "the 3.6  @xmath1 m  luminosity of m31 can be used to estimate the galaxy s stellar mass .",
    "using a typical value of @xmath44 from @xcite and the color - dependent mass - to - light ratios of @xcite , an estimated @xmath45 for m31 is about 0.8 in solar units . using @xmath46=0.3 $ ] and",
    "multiplying by @xmath45 , the resulting stellar mass is @xmath47 .",
    "recent dynamical mass estimates of the m31 disk+bulge ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are @xmath48 , in reasonable agreement with this derived stellar mass .",
    "asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars can be important contributors to the total near - infrared luminosities of galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , the most luminous agb stars are predicted by @xcite to have much redder colors ( @xmath49-[4.5]<1 $ ] ) than observed for m31 , so we conclude that they do not dominate m31 s 3.6  @xmath1 m  luminosity .    the 8  @xmath1 m  non - stellar emission",
    "is dominated by the 7.7  @xmath1 m  polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) band , which is a useful though imperfect star formation rate ( sfr ) indicator .",
    "it is therefore instructive to compare the m31 8  @xmath1 m  luminosity with other star formation indicators , such as h@xmath50 , radio , and total infrared luminosities and with these values for other galaxies .",
