    "the aim of this paper is to address the statistical physics of so called  active \" fields in developed fluid turbulence . these are fields that differ from the fundamental fluid velocity field @xmath0 , but that interact with the velocity field in an essential way , for example effecting a significant change in the scaling exponents of the velocity correlation functions from the classical kolmogorov exponents . for the sake of concreteness we will focus on two generic examples with very different interactions between the active and the velocity fields .",
    "the first is thermal turbulent convection , in which the temperature field @xmath1 is driving the velocity field through buoyancy effects . in the boussinesq approximation",
    "the temperature equation reads like a standard forced scalar advection problem , @xmath2 here @xmath3 is the thermal diffusivity and @xmath4 is a white random force of zero mean with compact support in @xmath5-space , acting on the largest scales of the order of the outer scale @xmath6 only .",
    "the velocity field is affected by the temperature . for an incompressible fluid of unit density @xcite ( dropping the dependence on @xmath7 for brevity ) ,",
    "@xmath8 here @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the pressure , kinematic viscosity , volume expansion coefficient , acceleration due to gravity and a unit vector in the upward direction respectively .",
    "the appearance of @xmath14 in the equation for @xmath15 is crucial , and changes the scaling exponents of @xmath15 .",
    "when the conditions are right it may even change the scaling exponents from kolmogorov to bolgiano ( up to anomalies ) @xcite .",
    "the second example is that of magneto - hydrodynamics ( mhd ) , in which the magnetic field @xmath16 is driving the velocity field @xmath0 according to @xcite @xmath17 these equations of motion conserve ( in the inviscid , unforced limit ) three quadratic invariants , i.  e. the energy , magnetic helicity and cross helicity @xcite    our main interest is in the properties of the statistical objects characterizing the active fields , including their anomalous scaling . here",
    "`` anomalous scaling '' means that multi - point correlation functions are homogeneous functions of their arguments , with exponents that can not be guessed from dimensional analysis .",
    "thus for example the field @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 being @xmath14 or @xmath20 respectively ) has simultaneous multi - point correlation functions @xmath21 where pointed brackets with subscript @xmath22 refer to averaging over the statistics of the advecting velocity field _ and _ of the forcing .",
    "the forcing is taken to be white random noise with zero mean .",
    "when the forcing is stationary in time this object is _",
    "time independent_. anomalous scaling means that @xmath23 with @xmath24 having a non - trivial dependence on @xmath25 . in what follows we will assume that the advecting velocity field itself is fully turbulent , and that its correlation functions are also exhibiting scaling behavior like eq .",
    "( [ zeta ] ) .",
    "the main point of this paper is that the statistical theory of the active fields calls for consideration of auxiliary passive fields that satisfy the same equations of motion as the active fields , but _ do not _ affect the velocity field itself .",
    "in other words , for the two problems at hand we consider the following equations of motion  : @xmath26 on the one hand , and @xmath27 on the other .",
    "note that the velocity field that appears in the equations for the passive fields is _ the same _ as the velocity field that results from solving the coupled equations of the associated equations for the active fields .",
    "the forcing terms @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ passives ] ) ( resp .",
    "@xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ passivev ] ) ) have the same statistics as the forcing terms @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ active ] ) ( resp .",
    "@xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ mhd ] ) ) , but they must have different realizations . while it is not true of course that the statistics of the passive fields are independent of the statistics of the velocity fields , it is true that the statistics of the velocity fields are independent of the statistics of the passive forcing terms .",
    "this is , however , not the case with the active forcing terms since these forcing terms affect the active fields that affect in their turn the velocity fields .",
    "it is thus not at all evident at first sight that there should be any relation , apriori , between the statistics of the active fields and their passive counterparts . on the other hand ,",
    "if there were such a relationship , this would be very advantageous , since the statistics of the passive fields is understood as explained next .    to understand the progress made in the context of passive fields @xcite ,",
    "note that the passive fields satisfy a linear equation of motion that can be written as @xmath31 with the actual form of the operator @xmath32 determined by the problem at hand . in recent work",
    "@xcite it was clarified why and how passive fields exhibit anomalous scaling , when the velocity field is a generic turbulent field . the key is to consider a problem associated with eq .",
    "( [ defl ] ) which is the _ decaying problem _ in which the forcing @xmath4 is put to zero .",
    "the problem becomes then a linear initial value problem , @xmath33 with a formal solution @xmath34 with the operator @xmath35\\ , \\label{defr}\\ ] ] and @xmath36 being the time ordering operator .",
    "define next the _ time dependent _ correlation functions of the decaying problem : @xmath37 here pointed brackets without subscript @xmath22 refer to the decaying object in which averaging is taken with respect to realizations of the velocity field only . as a result of eq .",
    "( [ oper ] ) the decaying correlation functions are developed by a propagator @xmath38 , ( with @xmath39 )  : @xmath40    in writing this equation we made explicit use of the fact that the _ initial _ distribution of the passive field @xmath41 is statistically independent of the advecting velocity field .",
    "thus the operator @xmath38 can be written explicitly @xmath42    the key finding @xcite is that the operator @xmath43 possesses _ left _ eigenfunctions of eigenvalue 1 , i.  e. there exist time - independent functions @xmath44 satisfying @xmath45 the functions @xmath46 are referred to as `` statistically preserved structures '' , being invariant to the dynamics , even though _ the operator is strongly time dependent and decaying_. how to form , from these functions , infinitely many conserved variables in the decaying problem was shown in @xcite , and is discussed again in sect .",
    "the functions @xmath47 are homogeneous functions of their arguments , with anomalous scaling exponents @xmath24 : @xmath48 where `` @xmath49 '' stand for subleading scaling terms . since eq .",
    "( [ zeromode ] ) contains @xmath47 on both sides , the scaling exponent @xmath24 can not be determined from dimensional considerations , and it can be anomalous .",
    "more importantly , it was shown that the correlation functions of the forced case , @xmath50 eq .",
    "( [ corr ] ) , have exactly the same scaling exponents as @xmath47 @xcite . in the scaling sense @xmath51 this is how anomalous scaling in passive fields is understood .",
    "lastly , we note that for the operator governing the time derivative of eq .",
    "( [ defg ] ) , @xmath47 is a zero mode .",
    "we will use the terms  statistically preserved structures \" and  zero modes \" interchangeably .",
    "of course , returning to the active fields , it makes no sense to consider the decaying problem ; as the active field decays , the statistics of the velocity field changes , and there is very little to say . on the other hand , we propose that it is possible to learn a great deal from considering the forced solutions , comparing the forced correlation functions of the active field with those of the passive field when advected by the same velocity field @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is devoted to making this point clear and solid .    in sect .",
    "[ convection ] we discuss the active problem ( [ boussinesq ] ) in comparison with the passive problem ( [ passives ] ) .",
    "a preliminary report of the correspondence between these problems was presented in @xcite .",
    "since we are interested in points of principle rather than quantitative details , we opt to work with a shell model of the turbulent convection problem .",
    "we will argue ( cf .",
    "[ summary ] ) that there are excellent reasons to believe that the results found for the shell model translate verbatim to the partial differential equations .",
    "the main result of sect .",
    "[ convection ] is that the forced @xmath52th - order correlation functions of the active and passive fields are both dominated by the statistically preserved structures of the decaying passive problem , i.  e. the functions @xmath53 of eq .",
    "( [ zeromode ] ) .",
    "the anomalous scaling exponents are the same for the passive and active _ forced _ correlation functions , they are universal ( independent of the forcing @xmath4 ) and determined by the scaling exponents of @xmath53",
    ". we present a careful discussion of the role of the statistical correlations between the forcing and the velocity field that exist in the active case , but are absent in the passive case . in the present problem",
    "the net result of these correlations is just an amplitude factor relating the moments of the two fields . in sect .",
    "[ vector ] we turn to a shell model of magneto - hydrodynamics . on the face of it , this is a counter - example to the previous case : the active and passive fields exhibit radically different scaling exponents .",
    "the main result of this section is that nevertheless the statistically preserved structures of the passive problem are shown to dominate the statistics of the active problem , but the existence of a conservation law in the latter results in an exact cancellation of the amplitude of the leading zero mode .",
    "we identify analytically the leading and subleading exponents of the passive problem , and then observe the cancellation of the leading contribution by the dynamics .",
    "the summary section [ summary ] presents the general lesson for the statistical physics of the ( nonlinear ) active problem .",
    "we propose that the zero modes of the auxiliary passive fields will always have a dominant role in the statistics of active fields .",
    "the active fields will thus share the same scaling exponents as the passive fields unless there exist additional conservation laws for the active fields . in all cases",
    "the calculation of the active scaling exponents can be achieved in the context of the passive problem , which boils down to finding the zero modes of a linear operator .",
    "in this section we examine in detail a shell model of active and passive scalars for which the statistical object can be computed to high accuracy .",
    "we consider a model that reproduces the conservation laws and the form of coupling between the active field and the velocity field in eqs .",
    "( [ active ] ) and ( [ boussinesq ] ) .",
    "our model is a variant of the shell model studied in ref .",

    "this is changed by the coupling @xcite , and the system of equations for @xmath64 and @xmath66 exhibits an inviscid unstable bolgiano fixed point , @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",

    "our main point will be that the _ active _ field will in its turn land on the subleading statistically preserved structure because the additional conservation laws exclude the leading one .",
    "we demonstrate this phenomenon in the next subsection .",
    "if we accept the general philosophy that active fields exhibit scaling behaviors that are determined by the zero modes of the auxiliary passive fields , then we should explain here why in the present case the active field avoids the _ leading _ zero mode , and appears to land on the sub - leading one .",
    "the answer is hidden of course in the conservation laws , as we expose now .",

    "( [ solbeta ] ) . however , we have in this case an important additional constraint that is absent in the case of the passive field , which can be inferred from the additional conservation equation @xmath233 repeating the analysis as above , and introducing a new object @xmath234 yields the two equations @xmath235 solving this system together with eq .

    "( [ eqeta ] ) is @xmath237 we thus conclude that as far as the active field is considered , the additional conservation law rules out the leading zero mode of the passive problem , leaving us only with the subleading mode which is observed in the simulations .",
    "in this paper we considered the correspondence between the statistics of active fields that are advected by a turbulent velocity field , and the statistics of an auxiliary passive field that is advected by the same velocity , but does not affect it .",
    "the two examples were akin to turbulent convection and to magneto - hydrodynamics respectively . in the first example the conserved variables for the equations of the passive and active fields are the same .",
    "for the second example the active problem exhibits additional conservation laws .",
    "this was shown to be very significant in determining the respective statistical physics of the two problems .",
    "the two examples appear very different in superficial examination . in the first example",
    "the even - order statistics of the passive and active fields turned out to be the same up to a single multiplicative factor @xmath87 , common to all orders .",
    "the forced structure functions of the active field scale with exactly the same exponents as the passive field , which in turn are dominated by the leading zero modes of the decaying problem .",
    "we analyzed in detail the source of the multiplicative factor @xmath87 and showed that it stems from the additional correlation effects between the forcing and the velocity field that are absent in the passive case .",
    "nevertheless these correlation effects do not cause a change in the scaling exponents .",
    "the general lesson that we would propose on the basis of this example is that whenever there exist a problem in which the equation of motion of the active field does not satisfy additional conservation laws compared to the passive case , the former field will exhibit structure functions that are dominated by the leading zero modes of the latter .",
    "this point is also pertinent to the second example . here",
    "the active equations possess additional conservation laws , and indeed the active and passive fields exhibit different scaling exponents .",
    "nevertheless we argued that the structure functions of the active field are still dominated by the zero modes of the passive problem , but not the leading ones .",
    "the additional conservation laws results in exact cancellations in the contributions of the leading zero modes , and the active problem lands on the next allowed sub - leading zero mode of the passive problem .    as a generalization , consider then a sufficiently turbulent velocity field which advects an active field , scalar or vector , which in its turn is forced by a force having a compact support in @xmath5 space . an auxiliary passive field which is advected by the same velocity field can be employed to find the zero modes of the operator involved in the passive decay problem .",
    "on the basis of the intuition gained with the examples presented above , we offer the following tentative conjecture : the forced structure function of the active field will exhibit scaling exponents that are the scaling exponents of the aforementioned zero modes . whenever the conservation laws of the active and passive problems coincide , these will be the exponents of the leading zero modes . when the active problem has additional conservation laws , these will be the next - leading zero modes , as allowed by the conservation laws .    finally , we need to consider the relation of our shell models to the physical problems and the pde s that motivate these models .",
    "it is important to test the conjecture stated here in that context . in light of the above discussion",
    "we expect that much of what has been found here will translate literally to the continuous problems .",
    "after all , the crucial aspects are the linearity of the advection equation , and the existence of conservation laws . these are unchanged in the continuous problems .",
    "of course , one can expect many more numerical difficulties , especially due to the role of angles in the multi - point correlation functions .",
    "nevertheless , the idea that the understanding of the anomalous scaling exponent of active fields boils down to the analysis of eigenfunctions of a linear operator is expected to hold verbatim .",
