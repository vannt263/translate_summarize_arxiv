    "silicon nanocrystals ( si - ncs ) have known very intensive research activity since last decade because of their very promising light emitting properties.@xcite the confinement of carriers in silicon structures leads to a strong enhancement of the radiative transition yield and to increase of the emitted photon energy .",
    "embedding si - ncs in wide band gap insulators is one way to obtain a strong quantum confinement ( qc ) .",
    "si - ncs embedded in a silica matrix have been obtained with several techniques as ion implantation,@xcite chemical vapour deposition,@xcite laser pyrolysis,@xcite electron beam lithography,@xcite sputtering,@xcite and some others .",
    "alternative preparation methods produces ncs with different surface terminations ( d , f , c , and others ) that earned some interest in the last years.@xcite moreover , also the role of nitrogen has been recently explored@xcite .",
    "if the response of single ncs can be described as atomic - like,@xcite in experimental samples no two ncs are the same , and collective properties have to be measured .",
    "experimentally , several factors contribute to make the interpretation of measurements on these systems a difficult task .",
    "for instance , samples show a strong dispersion in the nc size , that is difficult to be determined . in this case",
    "it is possible that the observed quantity does not correspond exactly to the mean size but instead to the most responsive ncs.@xcite again , ncs synthesized by using different techniques often show different properties in size , shape and in the interface structure .",
    "the characterization of the effects of these quantities ( size , interface configuration and passivation types ) on the final properties of the system , is of fundamental importance in order to determine the best condition for light emission and optical gain .",
    "previous works@xcite already observed that , while the electronic gap presents an oscillating behaviour with the size of the nc , the absorption threshold follows the qc for all the size considered .",
    "the effect is that the expected photoluminescence ( pl ) energy ( that is associated to the electronic band gap ) and the observed stokes - shift ( that is related to the difference between the absorption and emission energies ) , can not be simply described as a function of the bare nc size , but the specific configuration of the interface should be taken into account.@xcite + it has also been demonstrated that , for these systems , while the inclusion of local fields provide an important contribution to the absorption spectra , the excitonic and coulomb corrections almost exactly cancel out each other.@xcite this allows a simplification of the algorithms adopted in the calculations , still producing reliable results .",
    "+ in this work we present first - principles calculations of the structural , electronic , and optical properties of si - ncs of different size and shape , passivated with hydrogens , oh groups , and embedded in a sio@xmath0 matrix .",
    "the effects generated by the surrounding matrix on the electronic properties of the ncs ( of different size ) are analyzed .",
    "in particular , we compare a set of suspended ( free ) and embedded ncs in order to investigate the effects of the strain and the role of oxidation on the final properties of the system . + the paper",
    "is organized as follows .",
    "a description of the theoretical methods and of the systems under investigation is given in section [ sec_method ] .",
    "the structural , electronic and optical properties for the embedded and suspended ncs are analyzed in section [ sec_embed - vs - susp ] . in section [ sec_strainox ] the effects of the ncs size and oxidation are discussed .",
    "conclusions are presented in section [ sec_conclusions ] .",
    "the @xmath1-cristobalite ( bc ) sio@xmath0 is well known to give rise to one of the simplest si / sio@xmath0 interface because of its diamond - like structure.@xcite the crystalline embedded structures have been obtained from a bc cubic matrix by removing all the oxygens included in a cutoff - sphere , whose radius determines the size of the nc . by centering the cutoff - sphere on one silicon or in an interstitial position it is possible to obtain structures with different symmetries . to guarantee a proper shielding of the introduced strain by the surrounding silica we preserved a separation of about 1 nm between the ncs replica.@xcite the result",
    "is a structure with the silicon atoms bonded together to form a crystalline skeleton with t@xmath2 local symmetry before relaxation . in such core ,",
    "si atoms show a larger bond length ( 3.1  ) with respect to that of the si bulk structure ( 2.35  ) .",
    "no defects ( dangling bonds ) are present , and all the o atoms at the si / sio@xmath0 interface are single bonded with the si atoms of the nc .",
    "+ the optimized structure has been achieved by relaxing the total volume of the cell ( see example in fig .",
    "[ struttura ] , left panel ) .",
    "the relaxation of all the structures have been performed using the siesta code@xcite and troullier - martins pseudopotentials with non - linear core corrections . a cutoff of @xmath3 ry on the density and no additional external pressure or stress were applied .",
    "atomic positions and cell parameters have been left totally free to move . + the hydroxided - strained ncs ( s - si@xmath4-oh ) are obtained by extracting the ncs together with the first interface oxygens from the relaxed nc - silica complexes , and then passivating the surface with hydrogen atoms ( fig .",
    "[ struttura ] , center panel ) . also",
    "the case of hydrogenated - strained ncs is considered ( s - si@xmath4-h ) , by replacing the oh groups with hydrogens ( fig .",
    "[ struttura ] , right panel ) . in the last two cases ,",
    "in order to preserve the strain , only the hydrogen atoms have been relaxed .",
    "the equivalent hydroxided - relaxed ( r - si@xmath4-oh ) and hydrogenated - relaxed ( r - si@xmath4-h ) ncs are obtained by a further optimization and relaxation of the whole systems . + the goal is to distinguish between the properties that depend only on the nc from those that are instead influenced by the presence of the matrix .",
    "the comparison of the results relative to different passivation regimes ( h or oh groups ) could give some insight on the role played by the interface region .",
    "electronic and optical properties of the relaxed structures have been obtained in the framework of the density functional theory ( dft ) , using the espresso package.@xcite calculations have been performed using norm - conserving pseudopotentials within the lda approximation with a ceperley - alder exchange - correlation potential , as parametrized by perdew - zunger .",
    "an energy cutoff of 60 ry on the plane wave basis have been considered .",
    "in this section we analyze the role of the surrounding silica matrix on the electronic and optical properties of the si / sio@xmath0 systems . we compared the results of the composite si / sio@xmath0 systems and the suspended ones , including the effects of the strain induced by the silica matrix .",
    ".homo - lumo gaps for the embedded and suspended set of ncs .",
    "units are in ev . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section we explore the possibility that the strong discontinuity in the energy gap values for the ncs analyzed above , could be related to the different passivation regime of the interface silicon atoms .",
    "it is worth noting that a recent size - dependent experimental study of si 2@xmath5 core - level shift at si - nc / sio@xmath0 interface showed that the shell region around the si - nc bordered by sio@xmath0 consists of the three si suboxide states , si@xmath6 , si@xmath7 , and si@xmath8 , where for ncs smaller than about 3 nm the presence of suboxides with higher oxidation becomes favoured.@xcite in order to focus on this aspect , we produced a set of suspended ncs , each with different geometry , size , and oxidation degree ( see fig .",
    "[ clusterset ] ) .",
    "the strain has been intentionally removed from all the ncs , through geometry optimization , to elucidate further the correlation between the final gap value and @xmath9 . in parallel to the hydroxided ncs we also built the corresponding hydrogenated systems , and we then calculated the homo - lumo gaps for all the structures ( see fig . [ strainox ] ) .",
    "what emerges , for the hydroxided case , is a strong and clear correlation between @xmath9 and the gap value . for these sizes ,",
    "the dependence of the gap on @xmath9 is much stronger than that due to qc , so that a small variation in size could correspond to a large variation of the gap value .",
    "the effects of qc are still alive , but strongly modulated by that of oxidation .",
    "as already anticipated , the hydrogenated case does not instead depend on @xmath9 but simply follows the qc . as suggested by other works@xcite , we expect that for large clusters the gap becomes independent on the passivation regime , just following the qc .",
    "+ considering the results from the previous section , we could guess that the inclusion of the strain would reduce the homo - lumo gaps of fig .",
    "[ strainox ] , depending ( non linearly ) on the @xmath9 value . in our opinion , this would reduce the gap - fluctuations amplitude , and also influence the qc trend .",
    "in fact , by looking at table [ tabella1 ] we see that , by comparing for example the si@xmath10 and the si@xmath11 embedded ncs , the final gap do not follow the qc rule , even if they present similar oxydation degrees . in this case",
    "the strain completely overrules the oxidation effect . instead , for very different @xmath9 values the final gap still present a clear correlation to the oxidation degree , again undependently on the nc size .",
    "these considerations suggest a final picture in which the gap of small embedded ncs show an oscillating behaviour with size , and not strictly following the qc , as already observed in other works.@xcite the large broadening of the pl spectra , observed also at low temperatures , @xcite even for apparently monodispersed multilayered samples,@xcite could be a possible consequence of such fluctuations of the electronic gap with the nc size .",
    "+ the case of interface defects has been deeply investigated , sometimes suggesting that they have a small influence on the radiative recombination,@xcite and other times being indicated as the primary source for radiative emission.@xcite moreover , the presence of other oxygen - bond types is frequently reported in experimental samples , beside the single - bond type discussed here .",
    "several works report the si - o - si bridge bond as the most stable configuration , and the si = o double bond as the less energetically favoured.@xcite besides , these alternative bond types are especially favoured for large clusters sizes.@xcite in conclusion , we believe that these additional parameters ( defects , bond types ) would not modify the general picture related to the parameter @xmath9 discussed above , making it a crucial quantity for the characterization of small si - ncs .",
    "considering the @xmath1-cristobalite phase of the sio2 we have generated silicon nanocrystals of different size which are embedded in a silica matrix .",
    "the relaxed structures show that the surrounding matrix always produces some strain on the nanocrystal , especially at the si / sio@xmath0 interface . by including the strain on the suspended hydroxided nanocrystals we were able to reproduce the electronic and optical properties of the full si / sio@xmath0 systems . besides",
    ", the removal of such strain by a total relaxation will produce a significant reduction of the electronic gap .",
    "we found evidences that the amount of strain exerted on the nanocrystal is connected to the interface configuration , in particular to the number of oxygens per interface silicons ( oxidation degree ) .",
    "moreover we revealed that , while the quantum confinement dominates in the hydrogenated nanocrystals of all sizes , the behaviour of hydroxided and embedded nanocrystals show a strong correlation between the final value of the electronic gap and the oxidation degree , that seems to override the effects of quantum confinement for nanocrystals of diameters below 2 nm .",
    "the final picture indicates a competition between the oxidation and the strain , in which the former tends to blue - shift the absorption spectra , and the latter to red - shift it .",
    "at the end we suggest a final picture in which the gap of small embedded ncs shows an oscillating behaviour with size , not strictly following the qc rule .",
    "the strong fluctuations of the electronic gap with the nanocrystal size could be responsible for the large broadening of the pl spectra that have been observed experimentally , also at low temperatures.@xcite +        o. bisi , s. ossicini , l. pavesi , surf .",
