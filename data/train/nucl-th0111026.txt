    "it is well known that the theoretical description of the pion photoproduction on nucleon encounters the complicated set of problems : a number and a type of used diagrams , their gauge invariance , necessity of inclusion of form factors , taking into account off - shell effects , and so on .",
    "but the situation becomes significantly simpler for virtual photons @xmath3 in the electroproduction process @xmath4 at sufficiently high values of the momentum square transfer @xmath5 . in this case",
    "the diagram with the pion pole in the @xmath6-channel ( the `` pion - in - flight '' diagram ) becomes dominant under the standard conditions of quasielastic knock - out process : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( or @xmath10 ) , where \\{@xmath11 } is the 4-momentum of virtual pion in the nucleon and @xmath12 is the mass of final hadron state @xmath13 ( @xmath14 , etc . ) .",
    "for the first time the dominance of pion - in - flight diagram in the longitudinal part @xmath15 of differential cross section ( integrated over the asimuthal angles ) @xmath16 , was pointed in the paper  @xcite . later in ref .",
    "@xcite the analysis of the momentum distribution of pions in the nucleon was given in the frame of light cone dynamics .",
    "in our works  @xcite the discussion of the knock - out process is given in the laboratory system and just in this frame we find the momentum distribution ( md ) of pions ( starting from experimental data @xcite on @xmath15 ) .",
    "the similar situation is also for the transverse virtual photon @xmath17 ( really the knockout of a vector meson with simultaneous transformation of @xmath18 into the pion ) .",
    "it can provide a valuable information on the properties of vector mesons in nucleon  @xcite .",
    "these facts open a new possibility for the direct investigation of the meson structure of nucleon .",
    "our approach to the problem is very similar to the standard methods of nuclear physics , where the process of nucleon knockout has been used for a long time as a mighty tool for investigation of the momentum distribution of nucleons in nuclei .",
    "the cross section of quasi - elastic pion knockout from nucleon can be written in the form : @xmath19 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where asterisk symbols are for values written in the center of mass of the @xmath20 collision .",
    "the `` wave function '' ( w.f . ) of a virtual pion in the nucleon is the following k - dependent factor of @xmath15 : @xmath21 which can be related to the matrix element of the pion creation operator @xmath22 recall that for the standard @xmath23 vertex the transition amplitude can be written in the form @xmath24 as the normalization of all the above factors is fixed the norm of such w.f .",
    "defines a `` spectroscopic factor '' ( s.f . ) of the @xmath25 state in the proton @xmath26 the pion - baryon structure of nucleon can be described in terms of a set of such spectroscopic factors : @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , etc .",
    "when the longitudinal cross section is factorizable in the form : @xmath30 ( e.g. in terms of the pion - in - flight mechanism ) the w.f . and s.f .",
    "should be observable values in the coincidence experiments ( at fixed @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) . then one can define ( in analogy with the standard definitions in the nuclear cluster physics ) the `` total number of pions in the nucleon '' as a sum @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , etc .",
    "are all the possible virtual baryons in the nucleon .    in figs . 1 and 2 the longitudinal cross sections calculated on the basis of the above pion - in - flight mechanism ( at the value of @xmath370.7 and 1.2 gev )",
    "are compared with the old @xmath38 data  @xcite at @xmath390.7 and 3.3 @xmath40 .",
    "one can see that at both high and intermediate @xmath31 this mechanism is in a rough agreement with the data if the cut - off parameter @xmath41 is not so large ( @xmath420.7 gev / c ) , but new more exact data on @xmath15 at high @xmath31 would be desirable .",
    "the pole diagram with the @xmath2 meson as a virtual state in the nucleon provides the main contribution to the transverse cross section @xmath43 at high @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "however , the spectroscopic factor for the @xmath45 channel @xmath46 can not be determined from the experiment as the data are only available for too low @xmath47 as compare with @xmath48 .",
    "non - diagonal transitions @xmath50 for the pion - in - flight mechanism of pion knock out can be considered on the same footing , i.e. on the basis of the field - theory vertex function , but the standard expressions @xmath51 depend on too many free parameters ( @xmath52 and @xmath53 in each channel `` @xmath54 '' ) to be informative for definite predictions of cross sections .",
    "the constituent quark model evaluations of the above free parameters would be more effective .",
    "for example , the microscopic @xmath49 model  @xcite starts from only one free parameter , the amplitude of the vacuum @xmath55 fluctuation ( normalized on the effective @xmath56 coupling constant @xmath57 ) , but predict all the coupling constants @xmath52 and form factors @xmath58 of the interest starting from the standard quark - shell - model techniques  @xcite . parameters of the constituent quark model have already been fixed , and are not free in our approach .",
    "all the form factors @xmath59 only depend on two quark - shell - model parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( quark radii of @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) fixed earlier . at the standard values",
    "@xmath64 and @xmath65 we have obtained the predictions for @xmath63-@xmath66 wave functions in the nucleon ( see figs . 4 and 5 ) , where @xmath67 and @xmath68 . in the used proper normalization of the w.f.s we are able to determine the s.f.s for these virtual states in the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "this values could be extracted from coincidence experiments similar to the above cited  @xcite .",
    "such experiments would be more difficult because of too small predicted cross sections for @xmath69 channels , but they will be very informative for understanding the hadron structure in terms of quark and meson degrees of freedom .",
