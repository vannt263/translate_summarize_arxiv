    "the complex @xmath1 is called the _ matching complex _ and the complex @xmath14 is called the _ chessboard complex_. a piece of @xmath15 ( taken from @xcite ) is given in figure  1.1 below . here and throughout the paper , the vertex of @xmath8 labelled @xmath16 represents the edge @xmath17 of the graph @xmath7 .",
    "each @xmath9-dimensional face of the chessboard complex @xmath14 corresponds to a placement of @xmath11 nontaking rooks on an @xmath18 chessboard .",
    "indeed , a rook in the @xmath19th row and @xmath20th column corresponds to the edge @xmath21 in the bipartite graph , which corresponds to the vertex @xmath22 in @xmath14 .",
    "it is for this reason that the name `` chessboard complex '' is used .",

    "topological properties of the matching complex were first studied by bouc @xcite , in connection with the quillen complex at the prime @xmath23 for the symmetric group .",
    "bouc obtains several beautiful results .",
    "he considers the representation of the symmetric group @xmath24 acting on the homology ( over @xmath25 ) of the matching complex @xmath1 and obtains a decomposition into irreducibles .",
    "this yields a formula for the betti numbers in terms of standard young tableaux .",
    "bouc also obtains results on torsion in integral homology , which we improve and extend to the chessboard complex in this paper .",
    "prior to bouc s study of the matching complex , the chessboard complex was introduced in the 1979 thesis of garst @xcite dealing with tits coset complexes .",
    "garst shows that for @xmath26 , @xmath14 is cohen - macaulay if and only if @xmath27 .",
    "garst also obtains a decomposition of the representation of @xmath24 acting on the _ top _ homology of @xmath14 into irreducibles , for @xmath26 .",

    "the proof of theorem  [ ctor ] , while patterned on the proof of the theorem  [ mtor ] , is much more difficult .",
    "an essential ingredient is an interesting basis for the _ top _ homology of the chessboard complex .",
    "the construction of this basis has a surprising reliance on a result in tableau combinatorics , namely the classical robinson - schensted correspondence .",

    ", we show that if we could determine the exponent of the sylow 3-subgroup of @xmath83 or the exponent of @xmath84 to be 3 , then we could conclude that the exponent of @xmath68 is 3 for all @xmath29 that satisfy the conditions of theorem  [ ctor ] .",
