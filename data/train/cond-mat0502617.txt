    "crystalline solids are characterized by a periodic structure and , therefore , by the presence of long range - oder .",
    "a well - defined theoretical and experimental framework is available for characterizing the structure of crystals @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "numerous materials found in nature and widely utilized in technology exist in an amorphous state ( e.g. , glasses and liquids ) @xcite . characterizing the structure of amorphous materials is a challenging task because such systems organize over short distances and show no long - range order .",
    "moreover , the local structure in such materials is not unique and it can change throughout the sample .",
    "therefore , new tools are required to characterize the structure of amorphous materials .",
    "one promising approach is to develop order metrics ( order parameters ) that quantify certain statistical properties of the structure @xcite .",
    "recent work in this direction has been performed on the hard - sphere @xcite and lennard - jones ( lj ) @xcite particle systems .",
    "structural order was characterized with two metrics : a translational order parameter @xmath1 quantifying the tendency of particle pairs to adopt preferential separations , and a bond - orientational order parameter @xmath0 quantifying correlations between the bond angles defined by a given particle and its nearest neighbors .",
    "the novelty of this approach resides not in the order metrics themselves , which have been used before ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but in the idea of an _ order map _ , in which different states are mapped onto a plane whose axes represent the order metrics @xcite .",
    "the order map for the lennard - jones and hard - sphere systems consists of a line , indicating that the two order metrics are not independent @xcite .",
    "extension of these ideas to liquid water has proven to be most useful . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the structural order of cold liquid water was investigated and found to be closely related to the well - known dynamic @xcite and thermodynamic @xcite anomalies of this substance .",
    "it was found that there exists a region in the phase diagram bounded by loci of maximum orientational order and minimum translational order within which the dynamic and thermodynamic anomalies occur .",
    "water s order map was found to be more complex than for simpler , spherically - symmetric systems .",
    "state points define a _ two - dimensional region _ in the order map , implying that orientational and translational order are in general independent .",
    "remarkably , however , it is found that the region where water exhibits dynamic or thermodynamic anomalies defines a _ line _ in the order map , which implies that when water behaves anomalously , its translational and orientational order metrics are no longer independent , but are instead strictly correlated .",
    "this property was then used to quantify threshold values of the order metrics needed in order for various anomalies to occur @xcite .",
    "similar ( though not identical ) behavior was found to occur in another tetrahedral liquid , silica @xcite .",
    "notable among water s peculiarities is the fact that it exhibits polyamorphism @xcite , i.e. , the presence of more than one glassy form .",
    "uniaxial compression of ice-@xmath5@xcite or ice-@xmath6@xcite at @xmath7  k to pressures @xmath8  gpa produces a disordered high - density material named high - density amorphous ice ( hda ) . if hda is recovered at @xmath7  k and @xmath9  bar and then heated isobarically , it transforms irreversibly at @xmath10  k to a disordered low - density material named low - density amorphous ice ( lda ) @xcite .",
    "moreover , lda transforms to hda when compressed at @xmath7  k to @xmath11  gpa@xcite .",
    "the lda - hda transformation is reversible above @xmath12  k@xcite .",
    "furthermore , because it is very sharp and shows hysteresis , it has been suggested that the lda - hda transformation is a first - order transition @xcite .",
    "the lda - hda transition plays a central role in one of the thermodynamically - consistent scenarios that have been proposed to explain the experimentally observed properties of supercooled water @xcite .",
    "there are several other routes to producing amorphous ice @xcite in addition to those mentioned above . because glasses are non - equilibrium materials , their properties are history - dependent , and the specific procedure followed in the glass preparation may lead to different amorphous forms .",
    "it is not clear whether all the different amorphous ices can be classified into two _ families _ @xcite , one corresponding to lda and the other to hda .",
    "one complication standing in the way of such a satisfyingly simple view is the experimental observation that hda , when annealed or heated at high pressure becomes appreciably denser .",
    "the resulting glass is called very - high density amorphous ice ( vhda ) or relaxed hda ( rhda ) @xcite . whether vhda / rhda is simply yet another form of glassy water or whether , as suggested by simulations @xcite , it is the more stable form to which hda relaxes irreversibly is a question currently under investigation",
    ".    it should be evident from the preceding discussion that a precise characterization of structural order in water glasses is of considerably interest .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to provide such a characterization . in particular , ( i ) we use the order metric approach introduced in @xcite for equilibrium liquid water to quantify structural changes that occur when liquid water is cooled isochorically to the glassy state ; ( ii ) we quantify the changes in structural order that accompany the lda@xmath13hda transformation ; ( iii ) we investigate structural evolution during the annealing / isobaric heating of the amorphous ices obtained upon compression of lda ; and ( iv ) we compare the location in the order map of the various glasses obtained in ( i ) , ( ii ) and ( iii ) . by doing this , we are able to characterize _ quantitatively _ structural differences between samples of amorphous ice obtained by different procedures . in recent related work , guillot and guissani",
    "@xcite performed computer simulations of glassy water obtained along different paths .",
    "they used the radial distribution function and structure factor to study the structure of the different glasses . in this work",

    "[ hgw - ldahda-170k](b ) .",
    "we also show in the same figure the `` isotherms '' connecting glasses formed by isochoric cooling at the same rate .",

    "note that neighboring points along an `` isotherm '' are not connected by a continuity of states , but were instead attained by isochoric quenches at different densities . in all these cases",
    ", @xmath0 decreases monotonically upon compression , while @xmath1 decreases initially up to @xmath148  g/@xmath17 and increases thereafter . with exception of the isotherms corresponding to the fastest cooling rates ( @xmath149  k / ns ) , the low - density portions ( @xmath150  g/@xmath17 ) of all the curves collapse onto a common isotherm .",
    "we thus find that glasses with @xmath146  g/@xmath17@xmath151  g/@xmath17 , when sufficiently hot , share with the cold equilibrium liquid the remarkable feature @xcite of having only one independent order parameter , it being impossible to change one ( e.g. , @xmath0 ) without changing the other .",
    "we note , finally , that at high enough densities , appreciable structural differences between glasses formed by different routes are evident even when their thermal properties are very similar .",
    "for example , all the isochorically cooled glasses at @xmath99  g/@xmath17 are at almost the same @xmath43 [ see fig .",
    "[ hgw - ldahda-170k](a ) ] . however , fig .",
    "[ hgw - ldahda-170k](b ) shows that these glasses have very different order parameters ( next - to - last open symbols on each isotherm , on the low-@xmath0 end ) .",

    "this line shifts non - monotonically across the order map upon changing the density , and corresponds also to the location in the @xmath100 plane of the is sampled by the system both _ in and out of equilibrium_. the finding that the order parameters of the is fall ( for a given density ) on a line in the order map implies that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are not independent .",
    "in fact , we find that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are linear functions of the depth of the is , i.e. @xmath4",
    ".    we have also investigated in detail the structural order of the glasses formed upon isothermal compression across the lda@xmath13hda transformation . at the three temperatures studied ( @xmath152 and @xmath32  k ) , the orientational order decreases monotonically upon compression . however , the translational order decreases until @xmath153  g/@xmath17 ( approximately , the hda formation density ) ; further compression increases the translational order .",
    "we were able to identify two non - overlaping and well - defined regions : a high - q and high-@xmath1 region corresponding to lda , and a low - q and low- or intermediate-@xmath1 region , corresponding to hda .",
    "annealing ( i.e. , isobaric heating ) of compressed glasses is important experimentally : it has been found that it can change dramatically their properties @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we also have studied the evolution of structural order in isobarically - annealed glasses over a wide range of @xmath43 .",
    "we find that annealing lda not only decreases the density but also causes a significant decrease in translational order , while the orientational order barely changes .",
    "annealing hda ( this corresponds to the hda@xmath13vhda / rhda transformation @xcite ) , reduces the orientational order appreciably , and causes a slight increase in translational order .",
    "while structural changes upon annealing are significant , they do not cause lda or hda to move outside of their respective regions in the order map ( defined _ before _ annealing ) .",
    "we compared the structure of glasses formed by different routes in order to test whether we can relate the lda / hda glasses with those obtained by isochoric cooling at the same density ( at least , with the present cooling / compression rates available in computer simulations ) .",
    "the structure of the glasses formed by different routes can be compared by traditional methods , e.g. , the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution function @xmath51 , or , alternatively , by the order map characterization utilized here .",
    "when comparing the structure of isochorically cooled , and compressed glasses at same @xmath20 and @xmath33 , we find that the location in the order map is very sensitive to structural changes . among isobarically - cooled glasses at @xmath2  k and @xmath142 or @xmath154  g/@xmath17 , only those cooled at the slowest rates ( @xmath29 and @xmath155  k / ns ) fall into the lda region in the order map . in the case of the isochorically - cooled glasses at @xmath2",
    "k and @xmath99 or @xmath16  g/@xmath17 , they fall outside of the hda region in the order map .",
    "therefore , isochorically - cooled glasses in the appropriate density range can not always be classified as lda or hda .",
    "in contrast to the pronounced path - dependence of the structure of ` cold ' glasses , we find much weaker history dependence in the properties of glasses formed after isobaric annealing at @xmath41  k , when compared with those attained by isochoric cooling glasses down to the same @xmath20 .",
    "both the annealed and slow - cooled glasses are structurally very similar , and they are located in the order map on the same isotherm as compressed glasses at @xmath41  k. we also find that glasses formed by isochoric cooling to @xmath41  k collapse onto a common ` master ' isotherm in the order map regardless of their density as long as @xmath156  k / ns .    as a final observation , we note that all the glasses obtained in this work , under any condition and procedure fall in the accessible region of the order map , as found in @xcite for liquid water .",
    "this suggests that the inaccessible region ( at least for systems lacking long - range order ) is a consequence of constrains inherent to the molecular interactions and is not dependent on whether the system is a liquid or a glass .    in this work",
    "we have applied the order map methodology to the investigation of structural order in water glasses .",
    "we find that location in the order map is a sensitive descriptor of structure .",
    "we further find that at low enough temperature , glasses obtained by isochoric cooling are very different from those formed by isothermal compression , even when compared at the same density and temperature .",
    "we were able to identify distinct regions of the order map corresponding to lda ( @xmath157 ) , and hda ( @xmath158 ) , and to follow the evolution of structural order upon isobaric annealing .",
    "these results demonstrate the usefulness of an order metric approach in the quest for a more precise characterization of structural order in amorphous systems in general and water glasses in particular .",
