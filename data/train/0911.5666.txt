    "a possible explanation for such behavior is that in the 10x , 20x and 40x samples the individual mg layers are very thin ( 4 , 2 and 1 nm , respectively ) and surface energy might provide a relevant contribution to the enthalpy of hydride formation.@xcite another effect that might play a role is the fact that in these samples the ti layers ( 2 , 1 and 0.5 nm ) might not be thick enough to form perfectly closed films : the mg layers would therefore not be completely shielded from the clamping effect of the top pd cover . for the 40x sample a sloping plateau similar to the one measured for a co - deposited mg@xmath23ti@xmath24 alloy is observed,@xcite suggesting that the microstructure of this sample is closer to a mixed alloy than to a well defined multilayer .",
    "it is noteworthy that for the 10x , 20x and 40x samples a small plateau appears at very low hydrogen pressures .",
    "the width of this plateau is proportional to the number of mg / ti interfaces present in the multilayers .",
    "we interpret these plateaus as originating from hydrogen atoms populating the interstitial sites located at the mg / ti interfaces : in the metallic films the hydrogen atoms are located in interstitial tetrahedral sites , inside the mg layers these are mg@xmath61 sites but , crossing the mg / ti interfaces , there will also be mg@xmath62ti , mg@xmath0ti@xmath0 , mgti@xmath62 and ti@xmath61 sites . since the formation enthalpy of tih@xmath0 is smaller than the one of mgh@xmath0 , the substitution of one ( or more ) mg atoms with ti in a tetrahedral site will lower the absorption energy and the site will be populated at lower hydrogen pressures.@xcite as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ resistance ] , a similar small plateau at the beginning of the hydrogenation process is also observed when measuring the film electrical resistance , while loading the 10x sample used in the xrr measurement . a comparison of fig . [ resistance ] and fig .",
    "[ h2ography ] shows that , when loaded in the _ in - situ _ xrr setup , the 10x sample absorbs hydrogen at a higher pressure with respect to the loading in the hydrogenography optical setup .",
    "this is not surprising since , when measuring isotherms by hydrogenography , we want to obtain equilibrium curves and the pressure is increased very slowly in 20 hours . in the xrr setup on the other hand",
    "the loading was completed in 30 minutes and it is therefore not an equilibrium measurement .",
    "the small step observed at @xmath18230 pa in the pressure - resistance - isotherm can not be explained with simple thermodynamic considerations , but it could be related to the fact that the measurement is done in the kinetic regime , as such a step is not observed in the equilibrium isotherm obtained by hydrogenography .      while loading the multilayers in the xrd setup we exposed them to 1 bar of h@xmath0 at room temperature , a pressure sufficient to hydrogenate both the ti and the mg layers .",
    "nevertheless we observed an intermediate state in which only the ti layers were loaded .",
    "furthermore , upon exposure to air at room temperature hydrogen desorbs from the mg layers but remains trapped in the ti ones and the original metallic state can only be recovered by heating the samples up to 433 k. these loading and unloading sequences can be qualitatively explained by looking at the difference in thermodynamic properties of hydrogen absorption in mg and ti .",
    "pasturel _ _ et al.__@xcite have already shown how the chemical potential of hydrogen in different transition metals ( tm ) can influence the hydrogen sorption kinetics in mg@xmath0ni / tm / pd trilayers . here",
    "we extend their model to a system with 7 layers , in order to account for the multiple repetitions typical of a multilayer .",
    "the model treats hydrogen dissolved in metals in the lattice - gas approximation , without including any h - h interaction .",
    "the chemical potential of hydrogen in a metal ( @xmath63 ) is therefore written as : @xmath64 @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the partial molar enthalpy and entropy of hydrogen in metals , respectively .",
    "the configurational contribution to the entropy , @xmath67 , is proportional to @xmath68 $ ] , where @xmath69 is the hydrogen concentration in the metal .",
    "this term takes care that hydrogen atoms obey fermi - dirac statistics in the host metallic lattice , due to the single occupation of interstitial sites . in most metals",
    "the vibrational term , @xmath70 , is small at moderate temperatures and can be neglected , with the significant exception of pd ( @xmath71 jk@xmath48(mol h)@xmath48 at 298 k).@xcite    each iteration of the model consists of two steps .",
    "first , the concentration within each layer is updated according to the diffusion equation .",
    "subsequently , we impose the equality of chemical potential at the interface between two materials by changing the concentrations at the sites adjacent to the interface such that the chemical potential is made equal on both sites , while keeping the _ total _ amount of hydrogen atoms unchanged .",
    "note that the equality in chemical potentials at the interfaces does not imply the equality of hydrogen concentrations in the adjacent surfaces of the two layers . instead of using the experimental values of the hydrogen pressure and the enthalpies and entropies of hydrogen absorption in mg , ti and pd",
    "we define the following dimensionless parameters : @xmath72 where @xmath73 pa , @xmath74 is the entropy of hydride formation which , except for pd ( @xmath75 jk@xmath48(mol h)@xmath48 ) , is taken equal to the entropy of hydrogen gas at standard pressure ( @xmath76 jk@xmath48(mol h)@xmath48 ) and @xmath77 is the enthalpy of hydride formation : @xmath78 kj(mol h)@xmath48,@xcite @xmath79 kj(mol h)@xmath48,@xcite @xmath80 kj(mol h)@xmath48.@xcite substituting these values in eq .",
    "[ model ] and taking t = 333 k , we obtain : @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    in fig .",
    "[ diffusion ] , we simulate the loading and unloading behavior of a multilayer made of 3 ti / mg repetitions and covered with a pd layer , in which the mg layers are twice as thick as the pd and ti ones : 3x[ti(@xmath84)mg(2@xmath84)]pd(@xmath84 ) . in order to highlight only the effect of the chemical potential ,",
    "we assume that the hydrogen diffusion coefficient is the same for all the materials .",
    "the loading pressure is taken as 10@xmath14 pa ( @xmath85 ) and the unloading pressure is taken negative enough in order to allow desorption from all the layers ( @xmath86 ) .    )",
    "mg(2@xmath84)]pd(@xmath84 ) sample , upon hydrogen absorption ( @xmath85 ) and desorption ( @xmath86 ) .",
    "the vertical dashed lines represent the intermediate states , observed experimentally both upon loading and unloading , in which only the ti layers are hydrogenated .",
    "the white dash - dot lines are the simulated desorption rate from the ti layers at 433 k. , width=8 ]    upon exposure to 10@xmath14 pa of h@xmath0 the pd and ti layers and the uppermost mg layer load very quickly , while the mg layers `` sandwiched '' between ti absorb hydrogen more slowly , effectively producing a transient intermediate tih@xmath0/mg multilayer .",
    "this is due to the fact that at the beginning of the loading process , when the hydrogen concentration is low everywhere , ti acts as a hydrogen sink due to its lower enthalpy of hydride formation , effectively sucking hydrogen atoms lying at the ti / mg interfaces .",
    "when the ti layers are almost full the logarithmic entropic term in eq .",
    "[ chempot ] dominates over the energetic term and mg layers start to absorb hydrogen . upon unloading the effect",
    "is opposite : at the beginning the hydrogen concentration is very high everywhere and hydrogen atoms remain trapped in the ti layers until the adjacent mg layers are `` empty '' enough to equilibrate the chemical potentials .",
    "when desorption starts in the ti layers , however , the hydrogen concentration in the mg layers is so low that the total flux of hydrogen atoms through mg ( which is proportional to the gradient in concentration ) is minimal , resulting in a very slow hydrogen desorption . in fig . [ diffusion ]",
    "we also show that increasing the temperature of the system to 433 k enhances the rate of hydrogen desorption from the ti layers ( white dash - dot lines ) . with these simple simulations we can therefore give a qualitative interpretation of the persistence of hydrogen in the ti layers , both upon loading and unloading , as observed experimentally .",
    "we have prepared several pd - capped mg / ti multilayers with various periodicities by means of magnetron sputtering .",
    "the deposited samples have lattice parameters in the @xmath84 direction close to their nominal bulk values and low interfacial roughnesses .",
    "partial structural coherence exists at the mg / ti interfaces in the as - deposited state but it is reduced upon hydrogen absorption and desorption . the hydrogen loading sequence , as confirmed by xrd , xrr and optical spectroscopy , agrees with what is expected from thermodynamic considerations on the enthalpies of formation of magnesium and titanium hydrides : mg / ti @xmath87 mg / tih@xmath0 @xmath87 mgh@xmath0/tih@xmath0 .",
    "hydrogen absorption in both the ti and mg layers leads to large expansions in the vertical out - of - plane direction , well beyond the elastic regime , indicating that massive material pile up , due to plastic deformations and creation of defects , has to take place . upon dehydrogenation hydrogen",
    "is kinetically trapped in the ti layers .",
    "complete desorption only occurs upon exposure to air at 433 k leading to the original metallic layered structure , with a shorter coherence length .",
    "magnesium hydride in a mg / ti multilayer with period @xmath1 as small as 6 nm , retains its standard tetragonal structure , suggesting that the occurrence of a cubic hydrogenated phase , as observed in partially segregated mg@xmath20ti@xmath21 ( @xmath58 ) thin films,@xcite can only be stabilized by a very fine dispersion of mg - rich and ti - rich domains .",
    "pressure - optical transmission - isotherms measured by hydrogenography , can be interpreted on the basis of the clamping effect on thin mg films due to the adjacent layers@xcite and , possibly , on the surface energy differences between the metallic and hydrogenated states of ultra thin mg films .",
