    "we have illustrated that the plsm@xmath25 can be used to check which mesonic states degenerate with ( an)other one(s ) and which states degenerate faster relative to the other ones , especially near the fermi surface .",
    "the limitation that all hadrons should melt at a universal critical temperature ( qcd phase boundary ) can be understood as an approximation .",

    "<S> in the mean field approximation , derivative of the grand potential , non - strange and strange condensates and deconfinement phase - transition in thermal and dense hadronic medium are verified in the su(3 ) polyakov linear @xmath0-model ( plsm ) . </S>",
    "<S> the chiral condensates @xmath1 and @xmath2 are analysed towards determining the chiral phase - transition . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature- and density - dependence of the chiral mesonic phase - structures is taken as free parameters and fitted experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> they are classified according to the scalar meson nonets ; ( pseudo)-scalar and ( axial)-vector . for the deconfinement phase - transition , the effective polyakov loop - potentials @xmath3 and @xmath4 are implemented . </S>",
    "<S> the in - medium effects on the masses of sixteen mesonic states are investigated . </S>",
    "<S> the results are presented for two different forms for the effective polyakov - loop potential and compared with other models , which include and exclude the anomalous terms . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the polyakov - loop potential has considerable effects on the chiral phase - transition so that the restoration of the chiral symmetry - breaking becomes sharper and faster . </S>",
    "<S> assuming that the matsubara frequencies contribute to the meson masses , we have normalized all mesonic states with respect to the lowest frequency . by doing this , we characterize temperatures and chemical potentials , at which the different meson states dissolve to _ free _ quarks . different dissolving temperatures and chemical potentials are estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the different meson states survive the _ typically - averaged _ qcd phase boundary , which is defined by the qcd critical temperatures at varying chemical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal behavior of all meson masses has been investigated in large-@xmath5 limit . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that at high @xmath6 , the scalar meson masses are @xmath6-independent ( except @xmath7 and @xmath0 ) . for the pseudoscalar meson masses , the large @xmath5 limit unifies the @xmath6-dependences of the various states into a universal bundle . </S>",
    "<S> the same is also observed for axial and axialvector meson masses . </S>"
