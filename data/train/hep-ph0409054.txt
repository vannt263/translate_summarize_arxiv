    "the skyrme model is a nonlinear meson theory proposed by t. h. r. skyrme  @xcite .",

    "the baryon number @xmath1 corresponds to the topological charge .",
    "following the findings of the finkelstein - rubinstein constraints which enable a single skyrmion to be quantized as a fermion  @xcite , the model was identified with qcd in the large-@xmath2 limit by e. witten  @xcite .",
    "the static properties of nucleons such as masses , mean radius , charge densities and magnetic moments are evaluated upon collective ( zero mode ) quantization of the skyrmion  @xcite .    the einstein - skyrme system has been studied by several authors .",
    "the first obtained solutions in this system are spherically symmetric black holes with skyrme hair  @xcite .",
    "it was the first counter example of the no - hair conjecture for black holes discovered .",
    "later , regular solutions for @xmath0  @xcite and axially symmetric black hole and regular solutions for @xmath3  @xcite were found .",
    "the extended models to @xmath4 and @xmath5 were also studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is , however , necessary to quantize those skyrmions to interpret as gravitating or black hole nucleons .",
    "therefore , in this paper we shall perform collective quantization of the @xmath0 gravitating skyrmion and compute its static properties following the work of ref .",
    "the effects of gravity on the nucleon observables are examined . since the skyrmion picture of a nucleon is correct within about @xmath6 error , it is difficult to estimate the effects quantitatively .",
    "however , we believe that the results we have obtained can help us to understand qualitatively the effects of gravity on the nucleon properties .    in the einstein - skyrme theory , the planck mass is related to the pion decay constant @xmath7 and the coupling constant @xmath8 by @xmath9 . to realize the realistic value of the planck mass ,",
    "the coupling constant should be extremely small with @xmath10 , which makes the theory little different from the theory without gravity .",
    "however , some theories such as scalar - tensor gravity theory  @xcite and theories with extra dimensions predict the time variation of the gravitational constant  @xcite . thus there may have been an epoch in the early universe where the gravitational effects on nucleons were significant .",
    "we consider those effects worth being studied in the skyrme model .",
    "it is discussed that skyrmions could be produced in a manner analogous to the production of cosmic strings and monopoles in the early universe via the kibble mechanism  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism has been applied to the study of the production of baryons / antibaryons in jet events  @xcite and in quark gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "it may be possible to extend our work to these interesting high - energy phenomena where the hot and dense conditions in the early universe are mimicked .",
    "the classical regular solutions of the einstein - skyrme system with @xmath0 have been already studied in refs .",
    "we therefore give a short review of the model and solutions in this section .",
    "the skyrme model coupled with gravity can be defined by the lagrangian @xmath11 where @xmath12      [ ( \\partial_{\\nu}u)u^{-1},(\\partial_{\\sigma}u)u^{-1 } ] \\label{ls}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is an @xmath14-valued chiral field , @xmath7 is the pion decay constant and @xmath15 is a dimensionless free parameter .",

    "the skyrmion solutions for the various values of the coupling constant are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profile ] . as is shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , there exist two branches of solutions depending on the stability .",
    "we have examined only the solution in the stable branch since it is physically interesting as a nucleon .",
    "in particular , the stable solution with @xmath41 recovers the solution in flat spacetime and accord with the solution obtained in ref .",
    "no solution exists for @xmath42 .",
    "to describe physical nucleon and @xmath43 states , we need to perform quantization for the classical skyrmion .",
    "the field theory is truncated to certain collective degrees of freedom of the skyrmion , which reduces the problem to a simple quantum mechanics on the collective space . from the symmetry of the lagrangian",
    ", one can see that if @xmath13 is the soliton solution , then @xmath44 where @xmath45 is an arbitrary constant @xmath14 matrix , is also a solution with the same finite energy .",
    "therefore @xmath45 is the collective coordinate to be quantized .",
    "letting the matrix @xmath45 time dependent @xmath46 , we replace the field @xmath13 in the lagrangian ( [ ls ] ) as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the hedgehog solution constructed in the previous section . for the hedgehog solution ,",
    "the spin and isospin rotation are equivalent .",
    "definite spin and isospin states are obtained by quantizing those degrees of freedom .",

    "the hamiltonian is then diagonalized as @xmath55 where @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are respectively the isospin and spin quantum number with the operators @xmath58 let us note that if the scaling parameter is explicitly written in the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) , one can see that this quantization corresponds to the expansion around the skyrmion in powers of @xmath59 with the second term being of order @xmath59 .",
    "the nucleon , delta mass and their mass difference are thus given by @xmath60 for higher @xmath61 states , there are no counterparts in nature and they are considered as artifacts of this model . hereafter we adopt the same parameter set as in ref .",

    "it is seen that the mass difference increases monotonically with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : profile ] implies that the strong gravity makes the size of the skyrmion smaller which makes the inertial moment smaller , resulting in increase in the mass difference . in the collective quantization",
    ", the skyrmion can be quantized as a slowly rotating rigid body and the mass difference between the delta and nucleon is interpreted as a consequence of the rotational kinetic energy .",
    "thus the gravity works for increasing the kinetic energy of the skyrmion . in the naive @xmath67 quark model ,",
    "the mass difference is ascribed to the hyperfine splittings .",

    "the absolute values are both decreasing with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "this result indicates that although in the situation where gravitational effects are negligible , the assumption that the observed baryons are three - quark states with zero orbital angular momentum is a good approximation , it may no longer be valid under the strong gravitational field . in this case , the ground states of strongly interacting systems are not in pure s - wave and other states with non - zero orbital angular momenta should be taken into account .",
    "the axial coupling can be computed from the integral of the axial current @xmath97 the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : axial_g ] .",
    "since the axial coupling is related to @xmath98 and @xmath99 , our result implies that the strong gravity reduces the baryon decay rate , stabilizing the baryon against the strong interaction .    in ref .",

    "since the strong gravity reduces the transition moment significantly , it may be possible to determine the gravitational constant by observing the variation in @xmath102 .",
    "it is interesting that the decay rates are reduced by the gravitational effects whether the interaction is strong or electromagnetic , which means the gravity works as a stabilizer of baryons .",
    "we have performed collective quantization of a @xmath0 skyrmion in the einstein - skyrme system and investigated the static nucleon properties .",
    "although the spacetime is curved , the collective space remains @xmath14 .",
    "therefore the quantization is rather straightforward .",
    "modification by the gravitational interaction appears in the observables such as n-@xmath43 mass difference , mean radius , charge densities , magnetic moments , transition moments .",
    "the qualitative change in the mass difference , mean square radius and charge densities under the strong gravitational influence confirm the attractive feature of the gravity .",
    "on the other hand , the reduction of the axial coupling and transition moments by the strong gravity indicate the gravitational effects as a stabilizer of baryons .",
    "although the skyrme model describes a nucleon with about @xmath6 error , the possibility that it may provide qualitatively correct description of the interaction of a nucleon with gravity can not be excluded .",
    "it is expected that in the early universe or equivalent high energy experiments , the gravitational interaction with nucleons is not negligible .",
