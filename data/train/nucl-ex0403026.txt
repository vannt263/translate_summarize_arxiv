    "the in - medium modification of vector mesons has been proposed as a possible signal of a phase transition of nuclear matter to a deconfined plasma of quarks and gluons in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite .    even in the absence of a phase transition , at normal nuclear density ,",
    "the modification of vector meson properties are expected to be measurable .",
    "effects such as phase space @xcite and dynamical interactions with matter @xcite may modify the resonance mass , width , and shape .",
    "these modifications of the vector meson properties take place close to kinetic freeze - out , in a dilute hadronic gas at late stages of heavy - ion collisions . at such low matter density ,",
    "the proposed modifications are expected to be small , but observable .",
    "the effects of phase space due to the rescattering of hadrons and bose - einstein correlations between the daughters from the resonance decay and the hadrons in the surrounding matter are present in @xmath6 @xcite and au+au @xcite collisions .",
    "the interference between different pion scattering channels can effectively distort the line shape of resonances @xcite .",
    "dynamical effects due to vector mesons interacting with the surrounding matter are also expected to be present in both systems , and have been evaluated for the latter @xcite .",
    "those resonances that decay before kinetic freeze - out may not be reconstructed due to the rescattering of the daughter particles . in this case , the resonance survival probability is relevant and depends on the time between chemical and kinetic freeze - outs , the source size , and the @xmath7 of the resonance . on the other hand , after chemical freeze - out , elastic interactions may increase the resonance population compensating for the ones that decay before kinetic freeze - out .",
    "this resonance regeneration depends on the hadronic cross - section of their daughters .",
    "for example , the @xmath8 regeneration depends on the @xmath9 cross section ( @xmath10 ) while the rescattering of the daughter particles depends on @xmath11 and @xmath12 , which are considerably larger ( factor @xmath135 ) than @xmath14 @xcite . in the case of the @xmath15 ,",
    "the regeneration probability is expected to be higher than the rescattering of the daughters since @xmath16 @xcite .",
