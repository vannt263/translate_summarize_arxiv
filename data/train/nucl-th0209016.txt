    "the success of models based on the relativistic mean field ( rmf )  @xcite approximation in describing structure phenomena , not only in nuclei along the valley of @xmath1-stability , but also in exotic nuclei with extreme isospin values and close to the particle drip lines , has also renewed the interest in theoretical studies based on the relativistic random phase approximation ( rrpa ) .",
    "although several rrpa implementations have been available since the eighties , only very recently rrpa - based calculations have reached a level on which a quantitative comparison with experimental data became possible .",
    "two points are essential for the successful application of the rrpa in the description of dynamical properties of finite nuclei : ( i ) the use of effective lagrangians with nonlinear self - interaction terms , and ( ii ) the fully consistent treatment of the dirac sea of negative energy states .",
    "many studies over the last decade have shown that the inclusion of nonlinear meson terms in meson - exchange rmf models , or nonlinear nucleon self - interaction terms in relativistic point - coupling models , is absolutely necessary in order to reproduce ground - state properties of spherical and deformed nuclei on a quantitative level .",
    "techniques which enable the inclusion of nonlinear meson interaction terms in the rrpa framework , however , have been developed only recently in the calculation of the relativistic linear response  @xcite , and in the solution of the rrpa - matrix equation  @xcite . for a quantitative description of excited states",
    ", the rrpa configuration space must include not only the usual particle - hole states , but also pair - configurations formed from occupied states in the fermi sea and empty negative - energy states in the dirac sea .",
    "even though it was known for a long time that the inclusion of configurations built from occupied positive - energy states and empty negative - energy states is essential for current conservation and the decoupling of spurious states  @xcite , only recently it has been shown that the fully consistent inclusion of the dirac sea of negative energy states in the rrpa is essential for a quantitative comparison with the experimental excitation energies of giant resonances  @xcite .",
    "the rrpa with nonlinear meson interaction terms , and with a configuration space that includes the dirac sea of negative - energy state , has been very successfully employed in studies of nuclear compressional modes  @xcite , of multipole giant resonances and of low - lying collective states in spherical nuclei  @xcite , of the evolution of the low - lying isovector dipole response in nuclei with a large neutron excess  @xcite , and of toroidal dipole resonances  @xcite .",
    "an interesting alternative to the highly successful rmf models with nonlinear self - interaction terms , is an effective hadron field theory with medium dependent meson - nucleon vertices .",
    "such an approach retains the basic structure of the relativistic mean - field framework , but could be more directly related to the underlying microscopic description of nuclear interactions . in particular , the density dependent relativistic hadron field ( ddrh ) model  @xcite has been successfully applied in the calculation of nuclear matter and ground - state properties of spherical nuclei  @xcite , and extended to hypernuclei  @xcite , neutron star matter  @xcite , and asymmetric nuclear matter and exotic nuclei  @xcite . very recently , in ref .",
    "@xcite we have extended the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov ( rhb ) model  @xcite to include density dependent meson - nucleon couplings .",
    "the effective lagrangian is characterized by a phenomenological density dependence of the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 meson - nucleon vertex functions , adjusted to properties of nuclear matter and finite nuclei .",
    "it has been shown that , in comparison with standard rmf effective interactions with nonlinear meson - exchange terms , the density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings significantly improve the description of symmetric and asymmetric nuclear matter , and of isovector ground - state properties of @xmath5 nuclei .",
    "this is , of course , very important for the extension of rmf - based models to exotic nuclei far from @xmath1-stability ( description of the neutron skin , the neutron halo , pygmy isovector dipole resonances ) , and for applications in the field of nuclear astrophysics .    in this work",
    "we derive the rrpa with density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings . just as in the static case",
    "the single - nucleon dirac equation includes the additional rearrangement self - energies that result from the variation of the vertex functionals with respect to the nucleon field operators , the explicit density dependence of the meson - nucleon couplings introduces rearrangement terms in the residual interaction of the rrpa .",
    "the rearrangement contribution is essential for a quantitative analysis of excited states in the rrpa framework . in sec .",

    "it has to be emphasized , however , that even though relativistic calculations have been performed using non - linear effective interactions with different values of @xmath105 , these forces were not constructed specifically with the purpose of determining @xmath105 .",
    "rather , standard non - linear effective interactions have been used , which also exhibit other differences that could affect the microscopic determination of the nuclear matter compressibility .    starting from dd - me1 , in this work we have generated a consistent set of relativistic density - dependent effective interactions with @xmath110 mev .",
    "the same functional form for the density dependence for the meson - nucleon couplings has been used for these forces and , except for the value of @xmath105 , their parameters have been adjusted to the same set of experimental data on ground - state properties of twelve spherical nuclei  @xcite .",

    "the concept of effective nucleon mass is more complicated .",
    "in addition to the @xmath147 ( characterizes the momentum dependence of the mass operator ) and @xmath148 ( characterizes the explicit energy dependence of the mass operator ) , a third effective mass , the `` lorentz mass '' appears in the relativistic approach .",
    "it results from different lorentz transformation properties of the scalar and vector potentials  @xcite .",
    "however , what is usually termed `` the relativistic effective mass '' that characterizes an effective interaction , is a fourth mass : the dirac mass  @xcite @xmath149 where @xmath8 is the nucleon mass and @xmath150 is the scalar nucleon self - energy .",
    "it has to be emphasized that the dirac mass should not be identified with the effective mass determined from non - relativistic shell and optical model analyses of experimental data , i.e. with the `` non - relativistic - type effective mass '' .",
    "the dirac mass is determined , on one hand by the binding energy at saturation density in nuclear matter ( the effective single - nucleon potential is the sum of the attractive scalar and repulsive vector nucleon self - energies ) , and on the other hand by the empirical spin - orbit splittings in finite nuclei ( the effective single - nucleon spin - orbit potential is proportional to the difference between the scalar and vector self energies ) .",
    "this is the reason why , for virtually all mean - field relativistic effective interactions , @xmath151 .",
    "in contrast to the non - relativistic effective mass , the dirac mass can not be related to the isgqr . on the other hand",
    ", we would like to use the isoscalar quadrupole response to constrain the isoscalar properties of our density - dependent effective interactions .",
    "this can be done in the following way .",
    "we first notice that a particular ratio of isoscalar parameters @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) in eq .",
    "( [ func ] ) , characterizes the density of single - nucleon states around the fermi surface . in fig .",
    "[ figf ] we display the average energy gaps between the last occupied and the first unoccupied major shells @xmath155 in @xmath0pb , where @xmath156 and the sums run over occupied ( unoccupied ) states within a major shell .",
    "the average gaps for proton and neutron states are plotted as functions of the parameter @xmath157 @xmath158 see eq .",
    "( [ func ] ) .",
    "starting from dd - me1 , we have generated a set of five effective interactions with @xmath159 .",
    "for each interaction the remaining parameters were readjusted to reproduce our standard set of ground - state data for twelve spherical nuclei , as well as the nuclear matter equation of state .",
    "the average gap between the last occupied and first unoccupied major shells , both for proton and neutron states , is approximately linearly proportional to @xmath157 .",
    "this parameter , therefore , plays the role of the inverse of the effective mass . as functions of @xmath157 , in fig .",
    "[ figg ] we plot the corresponding centroid energy of the isoscalar quadrupole hartree response in @xmath0pb ( upper panel ) , and the peak energies of the isgqr obtained by the full rrpa calculation with the five density - dependent interactions ( lower panel ) .",
    "the calculated isgqr excitation energies are compared with the experimental value of @xmath160 mev @xcite ( shaded area ) .",
    "both the centroids of the hartree response and the isgqr peak energies are linearly proportional to @xmath157 and the comparison with experimental data on isgqr , therefore , places an additional constraint on the parameters that characterize the isoscalar channel of the effective interaction . for @xmath161 , in fig .",
    "[ figh ] we plot the rrpa isoscalar quadrupole strength distribution in @xmath0pb ( left panel ) , and for the isgqr peak at 11.2 mev the proton , neutron , and total isoscalar transition densities .",
    "the position of the calculated peak should be compared with the empirical excitation energy @xmath160 mev , and also the @xmath162 low - lying discrete @xmath163 state at 4.62 mev is found in good agreement with the experimental value of 4.07 mev .",
    "during the last decade the standard rmf models with nonlinear meson - exchange effective interactions have been very successfully applied in the description of a variety of nuclear structure phenomena . in the last couple of years also",
    "the relativistic random - phase approximation ( rrpa ) , based on effective lagrangians with nonlinear meson self - interaction terms , has been used to investigate properties of low - lying collective states and of giant resonances .",
    "the use of nonlinear effective interactions , however , presents not only a number of technical problems , but also the predictive power of models based on these type of interactions appears to be somewhat limited , especially for isovector properties of exotic nuclei far from @xmath1-stability .",
    "an interesting alternative are models with density - dependent meson - nucleon vertex functions .",
    "even though these two classes of models are essentially based on the same microscopic structure , i.e. on density dependent interactions , the latter can be more directly related to the underlying microscopic nuclear interactions . in a number of recent analyses it has been also shown that relativistic effective interactions , with explicit density dependence of the meson - nucleon couplings , provide an improved description of asymmetric nuclear matter , neutron matter and nuclei far from stability .    among the new structure phenomena observed or predicted in nuclei far from stability ,",
    "one of the most interesting is the evolution of the isovector dipole response in nuclei with a large neutron excess .",
    "the multipole response of nuclei with large neutron excess has been the subject of many theoretical studies in recent years , and some predictions have been confirmed by very recent experimental data on low - lying electric dipole strength in neutron rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "there are , however , many unknowns and this topic presents an interesting challenge for modern theoretical advances .",
    "it is , therefore , important to develop also a relativistic framework , based on effective lagrangians with density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings , in which the dynamics of exotic collective modes in nuclei far from stability can be investigated .    in this work",
    "we have derived the rrpa matrix equations in the small amplitude limit of the time - dependent relativistic mean - field theory .",
    "the explicit density dependence of the meson - nucleon vertices introduces a number of rearrangement terms in the residual two - body interaction .",
    "we have found that the rearrangement contribution to the matrix elements of the rrpa equations is crucial for a quantitative comparison with experimental data on giant resonances . in the present analysis",
    "we have performed illustrative rrpa calculations of the isoscalar monopole , isovector dipole and isoscalar quadrupole response of @xmath0pb .",
    "the calculations are fully self - consistent : the single - particle basis and the particle - hole couplings are generated from the same effective lagrangian , and the rrpa configuration space includes both the positive - energy particle - hole pairs , as well as pairs formed from hole states and negative - energy states in the dirac sea . on one hand , we have tested our approach by comparing the rrpa results for giant resonances with well known experimental data . on the other hand we have also analyzed how the rrpa results on multipole giant resonances can be used to constrain the parameters that characterize the isoscalar and isovector channel of the density - dependent effective lagrangians . starting with",
    "the recently introduced effective interaction dd - me1  @xcite , rrpa calculations have been performed for families of density - dependent interactions with a given characteristic ( nuclear matter incompressibility , asymmetry energy etc . ) .",
    "the analysis of the isoscalar monopole response has shown that only the density - dependent interactions with the nuclear matter compression modulus in the range @xmath111 mev , reproduce the experimental excitation energy of the isoscalar giant monopole resonance in @xmath0pb .",
    "this confirms our previous results obtained with relativistic effective forces with non - linear meson self - interactions and points , once again , to the pronounced difference between the values of the nuclear matter compression modulus predicted by microscopic non - relativistic and relativistic mean - field plus rpa calculations .",
    "the rrpa results for the isovector dipole response constrain the isovector channel of the effective interactions . by using interactions with different values of the volume asymmetry energy @xmath127 ,",
    "but which otherwise reproduce the same data set of ground - state properties of spherical nuclei , we have shown that the calculated ivgdr peak energy actually decreases by increasing the asymmetry energy at saturation .",
    "the comparison with the experimental ivgdr excitation energy constrains the volume asymmetry to the interval 34 mev @xmath136 36 mev . in the non - relativistic framework",
    "the isoscalar quadrupole response can be related to the effective mass of the mean - field interaction .",
    "the concept of effective mass in the relativistic mean - field models is more complicated , and the quantity which is usually termed as `` effective mass '' can not be identified with the effective mass determined from non - relativistic shell and optical model analyses of experimental data .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown that a comparison of rrpa results with the empirical isgqr and with the low - lying @xmath162 @xmath163 state , places an additional constraint on the parameters which characterize the isoscalar channel of the density - dependent effective interactions .",
    "the rrpa with density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings presents an important step in the relativistic description of the nuclear many - body problem . in the present work we did not attempt an analysis of the multipole response in exotic nuclei far from @xmath1-stability . in order to do that",
    ", pairing correlations must be included in the rrpa framework .",
    "work is in progress on the fully self - consistent relativistic quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( rqrpa ) , based on effective lagrangians with density - dependent meson - nucleon couplings , and formulated in the relativistic hartree - bogoliubov canonical single - particle basis .",
