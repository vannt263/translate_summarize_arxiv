    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) have been applied successfully in determining cosmological parameters and are also a key part of our understanding of galactic chemical evolution . however , there is still no agreement on the nature of their progenitors .",
    "it is generally believed that sne ia are thermonuclear explosions of carbon - oxygen white dwarfs ( co wds ) in binaries ( nomoto et al .",
    "1997 ) . over the past few decades ,",
    "two families of sn ia progenitor models have been proposed , i.e. , the double - degenerate ( dd ) and single - degenerate ( sd ) models .",
    "of these two models , the sd model is widely accepted at present .",
    "it is suggested that the dd model , which involves the merger of two co wds ( iben & tutukov 1984 ; webbink 1984 ) , likely leads to an accretion - induced collapse rather than to an sn ia ( nomoto & iben 1985 ) . for the sd model",
    ", the companion could be a main - sequence ( ms ) star or a slightly evolved subgiant star ( wd + ms channel ) , or a red - giant star ( wd + rg channel ) ( hachisu et al .",
    "1996 ; li @xmath2 van den heuvel 1997 ; han @xmath2 podsiadlowski 2004 , 2006 ; chen @xmath2 li 2007 ; meng & yang 2010 ; wang , li & han 2010 ; wang & han 2010a ; di stefano et al .",
    "meanwhile , a co wd may also accrete material from a he star to increase its mass to the chandrasekhar ( ch ) mass , which is known as the he star donor channel .",
    "wd + he star systems are believed to originate from intermediate mass binaries , which may explain sne ia with short delay times implied by recent observations ( mannucci et al .",
    "the aim of this contribution is to investigate the he star donor channel and to explore the properties of the surviving companions after sn explosion .",
    "we use eggleton s stellar evolution code ( eggleton 1971 ) to calculate the evolutions of wd + he star systems .",
    "the code has been updated with the latest input physics over the past four decades . in our calculations , he star models are composed by he abundance @xmath3 and metallicity @xmath4 . instead of solving stellar structure equations of a wd , we use the optically thick wind model ( hachisu et al .",
    "1996 ) and adopt the prescription of kato & hachisu ( 2004 ) for the mass accumulation efficiency of he - shell flashes onto the wd .",
    "we have calculated about 2600 wd + he star systems , and obtained a large , dense model grid ( see wang et al .",
    "2009a ) . in fig . 1 , we show the contours at the onset of roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) for producing sne ia in the @xmath5 plane for various wd masses , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the orbital period and the mass of the he companion star at the onset of rlof , respectively .",
    "if the parameters of a wd + he star system at the onset of the rlof are located in the contours , an sn ia is then assumed to be produced .",
    "thus , these contours can be expediently used in binary population synthesis ( bps ) studies to investigate the he star donor channel .",
    "to obtain sn ia birthrates and delay times of the he star donor channel , we performed a series of monte carlo simulations in the bps study ( see wang et al .",
    "2009b ) . in the simulation , by using the hurley s rapid binary evolution code ( hurley et al . 2002 ) , we followed the evolution of @xmath8 sample binaries from the star formation to the formation of the wd + he star systems based on the sn ia production regions ( fig . 1 ) and three formation channels ( see wang et al .",
    "here , we adopt the standard energy equations to calculate the output of the common envelop phase .    the simulations give galactic sn ia birthrate of @xmath0@xmath9 by adopting @xmath4 and @xmath10 , which is lower than that inferred observationally ( i.e. , @xmath11 ; cappellaro and turatto 1997 ) .",
    "this implies that the he star donor channel is only a subclass of sn ia production , and there may be some other channels or mechanisms also contributing to sne ia ( see wang et al .",
    "the simulations also show the evolution of sn ia birthrates with time for a single starburst with a total mass of @xmath12@xmath13 .",
    "we find that that sn ia explosions occur between @xmath045myr and @xmath0 140myr after the starburst , which could explain sne ia with short delay times implied by recent observations ( mannucci et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the companion in the sd model would survive in the sn explosion and potentially be identifiable ( wang & han 2010b ) .",
    "we obtained many properties of the surviving companions of the he star donor channel at the moment of sn explosion , e.g. , the masses , the orbital velocities , the effective temperatures , the surface gravities , the orbital period and the equatorial rotational velocity of companions ( see wang & han 2009 ) .",
    "these distributions may be helpful for identifying the surviving companions of sne ia .",
    "the simulation also shows the initial parameters of the primordial binaries and the wd + he star systems that lead to sne ia , which may help to search for potential sn ia progenitors . in fig .",
    "2 , we show the current epoch distribution of the spatial velocity for the surviving companions from this channel ( see wang & han 2009 ) . we see that the surviving companions have high spatial velocities ( @xmath1400km / s ) , which almost exceed the gravitational pull of the galaxy nearby the sun . thus , the surviving companions from the sn explosion scenario could be an alternative origin for hypervelocity stars ( hvss ) , which are stars with a velocity so great that they are able to escape the gravitational pull of the galaxy .    .",
    "( from wang & han 2009),width=302 ]",
    "based on the optically thick wind assumption , wang & han ( 2010c ) recently calculated about 10 000 wd + he star systems and obtained sn ia production regions of the he star donor channel with different metallicities . for a constant star - formation galaxy , they found that sn ia birthrates increase with metallicity . if a single starburst is assumed , sne ia occur systemically earlier and the peak value of the birthrate is larger for a high @xmath14",
    ". we also note that liu et al .",
    "( 2010 ) recently investigated the effects of rapid differential rotation on the accreting wd , and found that the highest mass of the accreting wd at the moment of sn ia explosion is 1.81@xmath13 for the he star donor channel , which may provide a way for the formation of super - ch mass sne ia in the observations .",
    "massive wd + he star systems are candidates of sn ia progenitors .",
    "hd 49798/rx j0648.0 - 4418 is an evidence of the existence of massive wd + he star systems .",
    "based on the data from the xmm - newton satellite , mereghetti et al .",
    "( 2009 ) recently derived the masses of the two components .",
    "the corresponding masses are 1.50@xmath150.05@xmath13 for hd 49798 and 1.28@xmath150.05@xmath13 for the wd . based on a detailed binary evolution model",
    ", wang & han ( 2010d ) found that the massive wd can increase its mass to the ch mass in future evolution .",
    "thus , hd 49798 with its wd companion is a candidate of sn ia progenitors .",
    "v445 pup is another candidate of massive wd + he star system , in which the mass of the wd is more than 1.35@xmath16 , and the mass of the he star is more than 0.85@xmath13 ( kato et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "us 708 is an extremely he - rich sdo star in the halo of the galaxy , with a heliocentric radial velocity of + @xmath17@xmath18 ( hirsch et al .",
    "we note that the local velocity relative to the galatic center may lead to a higher observation velocity for the surviving companions , but this may also lead to a lower observation velocity . considering the local velocity nearby the sun ( @xmath0220km / s ) , we find that @xmath030% of the surviving companions may be observed to have velocity @xmath19 for a given sn ejecta velocity 13500km / s . in addition , the asymmetric explosion of sne ia may also enhance the velocity of the surviving companions .",
    "thus , a surviving companion in the he star donor channel may have a high velocity like us 708 . in future investigations",
    ", we will employ the large sky area multi - object fiber spectral telescope ( lamost ) to search the hvss originating from the surviving companions of sne ia .",
