    "fransson and rasander @xcite have recently used a qme approach to study the rectification properties of a system of coupled qds by analyzing the occupation of two - electron triplet states as a function of the ratio of the interdot coupling and the energy splitting between the two qds .",
    "gurvitz and prager @xcite were the first to derive a hierarchy of qmes which keeps track of the number of electrons transferred from the source - lead to the collector - lead . using this hierarchy they studied the effects of quantum coherence and coulomb blockade on steady state electron transport in the high bias limit . in this limit",
