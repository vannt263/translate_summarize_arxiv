    "their central importance in supergravity theory can be anticipated in their applications to cosmology and dynamical black holes .",
    "the time - dependent generalizations of single static @xmath4-brane solutions were discussed in @xcite . those with dependence on both time and space have been first discussed in the case of a ten - dimensional type iib supergravity model  @xcite .",
    "the extension of static solutions  @xcite to the spacetime - dependent case for @xmath4-brane and intersecting branes in the ten- or eleven - dimensional supergravity are now well understood  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the explicit form of the warp factor in the metric has been obtained .",
    "the solutions are specified by the choice of the scalar and gauge fields and the values of the exponent in the warp factor of the metric .",
    "the solutions give the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) universe when we regard the homogeneous and isotropic part of the brane world volume as our four - dimensional spacetime , whereas they provide black hole solutions in a flrw universe when we regard the bulk transverse space as our three - dimensional space  @xcite .",
    "it was found that the warp factor in the metric is a linear function of the time except for the trivial or vanishing dilaton , and then even for the fastest expanding case , the power is too small to give a realistic expansion law as in the matter dominated era or in the radiation dominated era  @xcite . in order to find a realistic cosmic expansion",

    "an application of a static solution in the six - dimensional romans supergravity @xcite ( with a negative cosmological constant ) to brane world model was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "these solutions are considerably different from the above class of solutions because of the presence of the cosmological constant .",
    "some arguments on the origin of the cosmological constant in the context of string theory are given in @xcite .",
    "these dynamical solutions can not be in general derived from the ordinary ansatz of fields used in a @xmath4-brane system .",

    "brane collisions in the special case of @xmath4-branes have been originally discussed in @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to unify these two lines of development , by showing that the methods that have already been used in analyzing the dynamical @xmath4-brane system without the cosmological constant lead naturally to the extension of @xmath4-branes in theories with the cosmological constant .",
    "we show that quadratic functions of the time , more precisely of the world volume coordinates , appear in the solutions as the warp factor due to the contribution of a cosmological constant .",
    "these are similar to the dynamical solutions without a cosmological constant with a trivial or vanishing dilaton found in @xcite .",
    "we apply the resulting dynamical solutions to brane collision and cosmology .",

    "they are given without specifying the brane world volume and other part of the spacetime .",
    "we find that the basic difference of the solutions is that they involve einstein space for a nonvanishing cosmological constant , except for @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "secondly , in sec .",
    "[ d1 ] , we discuss the behavior of multiple 1-branes in our broad class of solutions in the @xmath0-dimensional theory and show that the solutions have interesting behaviors . for a positive cosmological constant and @xmath1 , 1-brane solutions approach the milne universe in the far region . for a negative cosmological constant ,",
    "the spacetime starts with the structure of combined 1-branes , but a part of it eventually splits into separate regions as the time increases from zero for @xmath1 , which is similar to the result in  @xcite .",

    "we see that @xmath69 dimension is critical . for @xmath70 ,",
    "namely , if the number of transverse space is greater than two , @xmath50 has an inverse power dependence on @xmath71 , while for @xmath2 it is proportional to @xmath72 .",
    "this is because @xmath50 is the harmonic function on the @xmath59-dimensional euclid space y , which follows from the ansatz of the metric  ( [ d : metric : eq ] ) and the form fields  ( [ d : ansatz for fields : eq ] ) .",

    "the metric obtained for the solution  ( [ d : warp : eq ] ) and ( [ d : h2:eq ] ) is not of the product - type .",

    "this solution leads to the inhomogeneous universe owing to the function @xmath50 when we regard the bulk transverse space as our three - dimensional space .",
    "if we consider the spacetime @xmath31 for @xmath73 to contain our four - dimensional universe , the scale factor of our universe also includes the inhomogeneity due to functions @xmath54 and @xmath50 .",
    "there are then two possibilities to obtain the four - dimensional homogeneous and isotropic universe in the limit when the function @xmath50 is negligible .",
    "one is the @xmath6 and @xmath69 case , which we discuss in sec .",
    "[ sec : d0 ] .",
    "the other is the case that we live in the three - dimensional transverse space y after compactifying the @xmath4-dimensional world volume . in this case , since we fix our universe at some position in the x space , the scale factor of our universe is proportional to the linear function of the cosmic time in the four - dimensional einstein frame , giving the four - dimensional milne universe . for @xmath74 ,",
    "this is the same description as the ordinary kaluza - klein compactification .",
    "note that the @xmath0-dimensional metric ( [ d : metric : eq ] ) is regular for @xmath75 but has curvature singularities where @xmath76 .",
    "so if it happens that @xmath46 changes sign somewhere in the @xmath0-dimensional spacetime , a spacetime is restricted to the @xmath75 region bounded by curvature singularities . around the @xmath77 plane",
    ", the spacetime appears to split into disconnected regions , though it is not really separated in the whole .",
    "we now show that this happens in our solutions .",

    "we consider the case of @xmath6 , i.e. , a 2-form field strength in the action ( [ d : action : eq ] ) in order to obtain a homogeneous cosmological solution .",

    "it is interesting to note that the power exponent of the scale factor is always larger than that in the matter dominated era or in the radiation dominated era .    in the case of @xmath66 ,",
    "time @xmath136 is bounded by @xmath155 , where @xmath156 is the time when a singularity appears at @xmath53 . thus if we assume that @xmath157 , the spacetime has initially no singularity , but the universe collapses to a big crunch , which happens at the different time @xmath158 at each spatial point @xmath30 .",
    "we have derived the dynamical @xmath4-brane solutions with a cosmological constant and discussed their applications to brane collision and cosmology .",
    "these solutions were obtained by adding a cosmological constant @xmath9 in the @xmath0-dimensional @xmath4-brane action @xcite .",
    "the basic idea was to consider field configurations in higher dimensions that are obtained by replacing the constant in supersymmetric @xmath4-brane solutions with warped compactifications , by a field on the world volume spacetime of the @xmath4-brane .",
    "the resulting @xmath0-dimensional metric and the @xmath10-form field strength depend not only on the quadratic function of the time but also on that of spatial coordinates of the world volume of the @xmath4-brane .",
    "we could never neglect the coordinates of world volume if we add a cosmological constant .",
    "thus , we find that the form of @xmath0-dimensional metric is similar to that of the @xmath4-brane with a trivial or vanishing dilaton .",
    "the difference from the @xmath4-brane metric is that the @xmath29-dimensional transverse spacetime @xmath32 is an einstein space and is not in general ricci flat except for the case of the 1-branes .",
    "moreover , the solution tells us that the function @xmath46 depends on all the world volume coordinates of the @xmath4-brane .",
    "hence , the contribution of the field strength except for the 2-form leads to an inhomogeneous universe .",
    "we have discussed the dynamics of 1-branes in the @xmath0-dimensional theory .",
    "since the curvature for the solution is singular at the places where @xmath76 , we should consider a domain where the metric is regular . in the asymptotic far - brane region , for a positive cosmological constant the 1-brane spacetime with @xmath1 approaches the @xmath0-dimensional milne universe , while for a negative cosmological constant it does a conformally flat and static inhomogenenous spacetime . on the other hand , in regions close to the branes , for concreteness",

    ", one 1-brane is approaching the other as the time evolves for @xmath103 but separates the other for @xmath113 . in the case of @xmath1 , for a negative cosmological constant",
    ", we have found that all of the domain between the branes are initially connected , but some region ( near small @xmath52 ) shrinks as the time increases , and eventually the topology of the spacetime changes such that parts of the branes are separated by a singular region surrounding each 1-brane .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath1 1-branes never collide . on the other hand , the case of @xmath2 , for a negative cosmological constant and @xmath113 ,",
    "could provide an example of colliding branes .",
    "we found that the collision time depends on both brane charges and the place in the world volume . as we illustrated in fig .",
    "7 , the collision process was observer - dependent .",
    "finally , we have also used the 0-brane solutions with a 2-form field strength and a cosmological constant to study cosmology . in the case of @xmath69 , the scale factor of our four - dimensional spacetime",
    "is a linear function of the cosmic time which is the same evolution as the milne universe . without a cosmological constant ,",
    "we get the cosmic evolution in the radiation dominated universe . thus , although adding a cosmological constant helps to obtain the expansion law which is closer to the realistic one , it turned out that it was not still enough .",
    "although one might think that the examples considered here may not provide realistic cosmological models , this is inevitable in such fundamental theories like supergravities unless we also introduce more matter fields and others .",
    "however , the properties we have discovered would give a clue to investigate cosmological models in more realistic higher - dimensional cosmological settings .",
