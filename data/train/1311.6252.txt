    "there is an obvious alternative explanation for the peak at 2370 mev from the production of the final state @xmath14 , whose masses add to 2379 mev , well within errors of the @xmath15 mass . fig .",
    "1 sketches the kinematics of this process , which generates 5 particles in the final state from 3 in the initial state .",
    "subscripts f and s in the figure identify fast and slow particles in the lab frame .",
    "the top of the figure displays the production of a neutral @xmath15 and the lower part shows production of a charged @xmath15 .",
    "interchanging the @xmath16 and @xmath17 in the final state generates @xmath18 and @xmath19 intermediate states .",
    "so there are 4 configurations of @xmath5 whose clebsch - gordan coefficients are taken into account in fitting experimental data .",
    "the @xmath20 branching ratio of @xmath15 is @xmath21 according to particle data tables @xcite .",
    "a prominent effect in wasa data is the abc effect of abashian , booth and crowe @xcite @xcite .",
    "f \" aldt and wilkin first outlined this effect @xcite ; gardestig , f \" aldt and wilkin g extended it to the reaction @xmath22 to explain an early result from wasa at celsius .",
    "production of @xmath23 is favoured if the pion has a low momentum ; otherwise production of a low momentum pion would be strongly suppressed by chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the end result is that there are 3 coupled channels : @xmath24 from the abc effect , together with production of @xmath25 and @xmath26 pairs in fig . 1 .    the recent paper of mielke et al .",
    "@xcite presents new data using the inverse kinematics to the cosy - wasa experiment : @xmath27 rather then @xmath28 .",
    "they detect the well known abc enhancement in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 spectra , but differences between data for these two channels require some interfering @xmath31 production at low excess energies .",
    "they model these differences in terms of @xmath32_{l=1 } \\to n\\pi \\pi$ ] , where @xmath33 is the orbital angular momentum between @xmath5 and @xmath34 .",
    "readers are referred to a paper of bashkanov _ et al _ on @xmath35 at 1.1 gev @xcite .",
    "these data reveal a definite peak in the fourth panel of their fig . 3 at @xmath36 mev , appearing slightly lower than 1440 mev because of limited phase space .",
    "one would expect a similar peak in @xmath37 .",
    "wasa instead attributed the peak to @xmath38 .",
    "however , @xmath39 decays of @xmath40 have orbital angular momentum @xmath41 .",
    "the centrifugal barrier factor already suppresses this decay mode near threshold .",
    "in fact , this @xmath41 barrier distinguishes @xmath40 from @xmath42 distinctively .",
    "so its low momentum tail can not be as narrow as the peak seen in wasa data .    why is the peak at 2370 mev so narrow ?",
    "wasa find a width of 70 mev .",
    "this is much narrower than the width quoted for @xmath15 in particle data tables @xcite .",
    "however , there is a straightforward origin of this effect .",
    "readers are referred to a paper of nakamura @xcite which provides a figure showing the variation of the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath15 amplitude .",
    "the real part of the amplitude peaks at 1370 mev and the imaginary part peaks at 1460 mev .",
    "accordingly , there is a @xmath7 change in the phase of @xmath15 over this mass range .",
    "this phase variation will introduce structure into the interference between @xmath14 and @xmath0 over a narrow range of 90 mev using nakamura s estimate of the mass , or 70 mev using the pdg mass .",
    "this phase variation can not be calculated a priori because of the three isobar model phases for the three coupled channels from the abc effect and production of @xmath25 and @xmath43 .",
    "these phases arise from multiple scattering amongst the 5 particles in the final state .",
    "it is therefore necessary to fit phases to the wasa data .",
    "an early paper of bashkanov _ et al _ shows in their fig .",
    "4 a blue curve for @xmath44 with a long tail extending to @xmath45 gev @xcite . this tail can arise from interference between the @xmath14 signal and the remains of a @xmath0 signal .",
    "their red curve shows the cross section for @xmath46 .",
    "a later paper of adlarson _ et al _ @xcite revises the result for @xmath47 . in fig .",
    "1 of this paper , the peak at 2370 mev of @xmath44 moves down slightly and a rising tail appears , joining on to the earlier results of bashkanov _",
    "et al_. the difference between @xmath48 and @xmath49 can arise from different isobar model phases for the three coupled channels @xmath50 of the abc effect and production of @xmath51 or @xmath52 .",
    "these effects are capable of explaining the 0.8 mb cross section evaluated for the peak at 2370 mev in the latest paper of pricking _",
    "et al _ @xcite .",
    "consider next decays of @xmath15 .",
    "below a mass of 1204 mev , phase shifts of carter et al @xcite are negative ; this arises from the level repulsion between the nucleon and @xmath15 which have the same quantum numbers .",
    "the phase shift then rises rapidly and reaches @xmath53 at 1320 mev and the analysis of nakamura shows that it reaches @xmath7 at 1370 mev ; over this mass range , decays to @xmath54 are dominant .",
    "then decays to @xmath20 rise rapidly as its phase space increases .",
    "this channel accounts for the rapid rise of the imaginary part of the @xmath15 amplitude .",
    "there is a corollary concerning the figure of nakamura @xcite .",
    "the decay of @xmath55 produces a p - wave pion .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of amplitudes shown in his figure resemble a broad p - wave cusp in the @xmath20 channel .",
    "the real part of the amplitude peaks first , followed by a peak in the imaginary part of the amplitude ; this is characteristic of a cusp in the p - wave , where the centrifugal barrier delays the peak in the imaginary part @xcite .    in the late 1970 s",
    "there were claims for the existence of several dibaryons in the reaction @xmath56 over lab kinetic energies of 600800 mev in @xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 partial waves .",
    "however , these claims were eventually disproved by a partial wave analysis which included many sets of spin dependent data produced by the geneva group working at psi @xcite and by several groups at lampf in the range of lab kinetic energies 500 - 800 mev .",
    "in addition , many spin dependent measurements were made at lampf using a polarised proton beam whose spin could be rotated to three orientations : the n direction , normal to the plane of scattering , the s ( sideways ) direction in the plane of scattering and normal to the beam , and the l direction ( longitudinal ) along the beam .",
    "these protons scattered from a longitudinally polarised target @xcite .",
    "the data determined magnitudes and phases of all partial waves up to @xmath58 @xcite , except that the phase of one small partial wave , @xmath60 , needed to be constrained to a calculation done by blankleider @xcite , and extended later by blankleider and afnan @xcite .",
    "earlier than this , hoenig and rinat predicted in 1974 that loops would appear on the argand diagrams for @xmath61 amplitudes from projection of the @xmath62 @xmath63 resonance when @xmath64 kinematics and fermi motion are folded in @xcite ; that was precisely how it turned out eventually .",
    "an extension of the lampf experiment determined the spin dependence of @xmath65 from 492 to 796 mev lab kinetic energy @xcite .",
    "spin correlation parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 were measured .",
    "the parameter @xmath69 alone is not sufficient to determine the full argand plot of amplitudes and their interferences . in the representations",
    "popularly used , it measures the imaginary part of the interferences between amplitudes .",
    "the parameter @xmath70 measures the real part of the same interferences .",
    "there is a general theorem for all final states that @xmath71 measures the imaginary part of exactly the same amplitudes and is therefore a very powerful constraint .",
    "there is limited sensitivity in the parameter @xmath72 because of the longitudinal orientation of the target polarisation .",
    "results from this experiment ruled out broad dibaryons in this mass range in the dominant @xmath73 @xmath59 and @xmath58 partial waves and smaller partial waves were negligibly small @xcite . in the @xmath57 amplitude ,",
    "a phase variation of @xmath74 was observed .",
    "the conclusion was that the @xmath75 phase variation required for a dibaryon resonance was definitely ruled out .",
    "a further remark is that there is presently no evidence for the existence of the @xmath76 dibaryon",
    ".    it would be very important if @xmath0 dibaryons exist .",
    "however , this needs to be proved .",
    "the wasa data presently contain only one phase sensitive measurement , @xmath69 .",
    "this is inadequate for a full determination of all partial waves .",
    "the key point is that a claim for the existence of a dibaryon resonance must map out the phase variation in the argand diagram and prove the existence of a pole .",
    "there are data for @xmath77 and @xmath78 , but these depend only on intensities .",
    "so there is insufficient data at present to map out argand diagrams for individual partial waves . without these argand diagrams ,",
    "there is no proof of the existence of a dibaryon .",
    "what is needed is to use a polarised proton beam to study the same set of parameters as were measured at lampf .",
    "it would require the use of a solenoid to rotate the beam polarisation and a polarised target .",
    "this would extend enormously the physics content of the data . from such an experiment",
    "it should be possible to establish in a single run whether the @xmath14 channel accounts for the present wasa data and how it interferes with @xmath0 final states .",
    "this should hopefully complete the wasa experiments on this topic .",
