    "the study of spin - dependent transport phenomena has recently attracted much attention.@xcite it has opened the way for the field of spintronics,@xcite literally spin electronics , where new device functionalities exploit both the charge and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "there are various approaches in this sphere .",
    "for instance , the use of a quantum - dot setup@xcite has been proposed , which can be operated either as a spin filter to produce spin - polarized currents or as a device to detect and manipulate spin states .",
    "spintronics in graphene has also been proposed@xcite recently . in the following we address this issue in a new type of materials , graphene nanodisks.@xcite    graphene nanostructure@xcite such as graphene nanoribbonsfujita , ezawaprb , brey , rojas , son , barone , kim , avouris , xu , ozyilmaz and graphene nanodisks@xcite could be basic components of future nanoelectronic and spintronic devices .",
    "graphene nanodisks are nanometer - scale disk - like materials which have closed edges .",
    "they are constructed by connecting several benzenes , some of which have already been manufactured by soft - landing mass spectrometry.rader,kim,berger there are varieties of nanodisks , among which zigzag trigonal nanodisks with size @xmath0 are prominent because they have @xmath0-fold degenerated zero - energy states .",
    "we have already shown@xcite that spins make a ferromagnetic order and that the relaxation time is finite but quite large even if the size @xmath0 is very small .",
    "we refer to this property as quasi - ferromagnet .",
    "furthermore we have argued@xcite that a nanodisk behaves as if it were a quantum dot with an internal degree of freedom , where the conductance exhibits a peculiar series of coulomb blockade peaks .",
    "in this paper we make an investigation of the spin current in the zero - energy sector of the trigonal zigzag nanodisk .",
    "we first analyze how the spin of a nanodisk filters the spin of the current by assuming that the nanodisk is a rigid ferromagnet .",
    "the fact that the direct and exchange coulomb interactions are of the same of magnitude plays an important role .",
    "however the nanodisk is not a rigid ferromagnet but a quasi - ferromagnet .",
    "hence an intriguing reaction phenomenon occurs : namely , the spin of the nanodisk can be controlled by the spin of the current . using these properties we propose some applications for spintronic devices , such as spin memory , spin amplifier , spin valve , spin - field - effect transistor and spin diode .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.[secnanodisk ] , we summarize the basic notion of the nanodisk . the low - energy physics is described by electrons in the @xmath0-fold degenerated zero - energy sector , which form a quasi - ferromagnet due to a large exchange interaction . in sec.secspinfilter , we investigate the spin - filter effects based on the master equation . in sec.[secreaction ] , we analyze the reaction to the spin of the nanodisk from the spin of electrons in the current .",
    "we discuss the relaxation process using the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation . in sec.secapplication",
    ", we propose various spintronic devices and explore their properties .",
    "graphene nanodisks are graphene derivatives which have closed edges .",
    "the hamiltonian is defined by@xmath1where @xmath2 is the site energy , @xmath3 is the transfer energy , and @xmath4 is the creation operator of the @xmath5 electron at the site @xmath6 .",
    "the summation is taken over all nearest neighboring sites @xmath7 . owing to their homogeneous geometrical configuration",
    ", we may take constant values for these energies , @xmath8 and @xmath9ev .",
    "we have searched for zero - energy states or equivalently metallic states in graphene nanodisks with various sizes and shapes.@xcite the emergence of zero - energy states is surprisingly rare . among typical nanodisks , only trigonal zigzag nanodisks have degenerate zero - energy states and show metallic ferromagnetism , where the degeneracy can be controlled arbitrarily by designing the size .",
    "trigonal zigzag nanodisks are specified by the size parameter @xmath0 as in fig.[fignanodisk](a ) .",
    "the size-@xmath0 nanodisk has @xmath0-fold degenerated zero - energy states,@xcite where the gap energy is as large as a few ev .",
    "hence it is a good approximation to investigate the electron - electron interaction physics only in the zero - energy sector , by projecting the system to the subspace made of those zero - energy states .",
    "the zero - energy sector consists of @xmath0 orthonormal states @xmath10 , @xmath11 , together with the su(n ) symmetry .",
    "we can expand the wave function of the state @xmath10,@xmath12 in terms of the wannier function @xmath13 localized at the site @xmath6 .",

    "( b ) the nanodisk - lead system .",
    "the nanodisk with @xmath16 is connected to the right and left leads by tunneling coupling @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the chemical potential is @xmath19 or @xmath20 at each lead .",

    "the remarkable feature is that there exists a large overlap between the wave functions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 , since the state @xmath10 is an ensemble of sites as in ( [ eqa ] ) and identical sites are included in @xmath34 and @xmath24 .",
    "consequently , the dominant contributions come from the on - site coulomb terms not only for the coulomb energy but also for the exchange energy : indeed , it follows that @xmath35 in the on - site approximation .",
    "we thus obtain@xmath36where@xmath37with the coulomb potential @xmath38 .",
    "the coulomb energy @xmath39 is of the order of @xmath40ev because the lattice spacing of the carbon atoms is @xmath41  in graphene .    since the exchange energy @xmath23 is as large as the coulomb energy @xmath22 , the spin stiffness @xmath23 is quite large",
    "furthermore , we have checked@xcite numerically that all @xmath42 are of the same order of magnitude for any pair of @xmath43 and @xmath44 , implying that the su(n ) symmetry is broken but not so strongly in the hamiltonian ( [ hamilferro ] ) .",

    "the nanodisk - lead system looks similar to that of the @xmath0-dot system.tarucharev however , there exists a crucial difference . on one hand , in the ordinary @xmath0-dot system",

    "an electron does not hop from one state to another state .",
    "hence , it is more appropriate to regard our nanodisk as a one - dot system with an internal degree of freedom .",
    "the aim of this paper is to investigate a nanodisk as a spin filternittaprl02 based on the hamiltonian ( [ totalhamil ] ) .",
