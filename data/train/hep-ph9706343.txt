    "furthermore , at @xmath53 one enters the @xmath54 dominated region of @xmath55 and @xmath52 must become as large as for vector meson production , which is indeed seen in the fixed-@xmath4 data from zeus @xcite .",
    "this is one of the manifestations of the duality between the continuum and vector meson production derived in @xcite . for fixed @xmath49 , the exponent @xmath52 must not depend on @xmath37",
    "production of @xmath40 dijets in ddis at @xmath56 , and/or by real photons , is especially interesting . in 1994",
    "we showed that in this case the transverse momentum @xmath44 of jets probes directly the transverse momentum of gluons in the pomeron @xcite and @xmath57 .",
    "ddis at @xmath58 0.10.2 comes from excitation of the @xmath59 and higher fock states of the photon .",
    "it is dis off the pomeron sea with the typical sea structure function , @xmath60 which obeys an approximate triple - pomeron factorization conjectured in @xcite and derived in @xcite , f_2^d(4)(p_^2=0,x_,,q^2 ) f_2p(x_,q_sea^2 ) , [ eq:2.4 ] which is similar to the triple - pomeron limit of soft diffraction @xmath61 @xmath62 here @xmath63 0.2-@xmath64 is a propagation radius for perturbative gluons . in @xcite",
    "we showed that although @xmath65 0.15 - 0.2 gev@xmath66 is the dimensional quantity , it does not change much from @xmath67 to dis ; parametrically @xmath68 .",
    "the normalization of the pomeron sea structure function * predicted * in @xcite is in good agreement with the experiment , see @xcite and fig .  1 .",
    "cc ddis has several peculiarities @xcite : first , both the @xmath69 and @xmath70 receive extra contributions , and @xmath70 is anomalously large at small @xmath37 because of the nonconservation of weak currents , for the similar findings in standard dis see @xcite .",
    "second , in the large-@xmath49 cc ddis with @xmath71 beams one excites the @xmath72 pairs and the pqcd scale @xmath73 is different for ddis with leading charm , @xmath74 and leading ( anti)strangeness , @xmath75 .",
    "third , the @xmath76 distribution of the charm changes from the forward to backward hemispheres in the diffractive system .",
    "the interpretation of @xmath40 excitation as dis off the intrinsic @xmath40 of the pomeron must be taken with the grain of salt , because for the above variety of pqcd scales ( @xmath77 ) , the flavor , valence , sea and glue composition of the pomeron changes with @xmath78 @xcite . furthermore , because the pqcd scales @xmath79 depend on @xmath49 , and the @xmath78 and @xmath49 dependences are inextricably entangled , it is crystal clear that the often postulated @xcite , but never proven , diffractive and/or ingelman - schlein factorization , @xmath80 , with the process independent flux of pomerons in the proton @xmath81 and the @xmath78 independent structure function @xmath82 * does not exist in qcd . *    besides this diffractive factorization breaking , we predicted an unprecedented dominance of the higher twist @xmath45 at @xmath47 , which makes the dglap evolution of @xmath83 completely invalid at large @xmath49 .",
    "still further , upon the @xmath76 integration , the factor @xmath84 $ ] in ( [ eq:2.1 ] ) transforms into the factor @xmath85 $ ] in @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "such an abnormal enhancement of a higher twist , @xmath87 , is unprecedented in dis .",
    "this higher twist is especially large at @xmath88 and is a further strong objection to the blind dglap evolution of @xmath86 .",
    "this higher twist is a likely explanation @xcite of the h1 finding @xcite of the rise of @xmath17 with @xmath37 even for large @xmath49 , for the related discussion see also @xcite . in the cc ddis",
    "there are still more higher twists which are due to the nonconservation of charged currents @xcite .",
    "the non - negotiable prediction from pqcd is a substantial intrinsic charm in the pomeron @xcite , the abundance of which for @xmath89 is predicted to rise from @xmath903% at @xmath91 to @xmath92 at @xmath93 .",
    "we predicted the charm abundance @xmath94 at @xmath56 from excitation of the @xmath95 and higher states .",
    "this intrinsic charm explains perfectly the diffractive charm data reported at dis97 @xcite without invoking unnatural hard glue in the pomeron .",
    "the above findings did not make their way yet into the widely used monte carlo codes for ddis , which are all still based on the discredited diffractive factorization and the dglap evolution of the large-@xmath49 diffractive structure function . as we have seen above , the transverse momentum structure of final states in ddis is quite different from that in the standard dis .",
    "an analysis @xcite of higher orders in ddis has shown that the structure of real and virtual radiative corrections in ddis and standard dis is different , and one needs more work on final state radiation before turning on hadron shower codes which were developed for , and fine tuned to , the standard dis final states . in conclusion , all the dglap analysis and the factorization model - based conclusions on the hard glue in the pomeron are suspect .",
    "one badly needs monte - carlo implementation of the color dipole picture with due incorporation of the above host of pqcd scales , which is not available at the moment .",
    "the situation changes at @xmath96 , where @xmath97 has been proven to satisfy the conventional dglap evolution in @xmath98 ( at least for a fixed @xmath78 ) @xcite .",
    "the obvious conclusions are the rise of @xmath99 as @xmath49 decreases and/or @xmath37 rises and ( still approximate ) applicability of the conventional parton model for hard scattering off the pomeron .    incidentally , via unitarity the diffractive higher twist also implies substantial higher twist effects in the proton structure function at @xmath100 , which hitherto has been ignored in the qcd analysis of the hera data .",
    "the real reason behind the plethora of pqcd scales and effective intercepts @xmath52 which vary with @xmath101 and flavor , is that the qcd pomeron described by the running bfkl equation is a sequence of * moving * poles with intercepts @xmath102 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath103 labels the eigenfunctions @xmath104 of the running bfkl equation for the dipole cross section and equals the number of nodes in @xmath104 , for more details see zoller s talk at dis97 @xcite .",
    "the onset of the dominance of the rightmost pole with @xmath105 is elusive because of the substantial contribution from the subleading poles in the range of @xmath106 accessible at hera @xcite .    besides the subleading pomeron poles , ddis at a",
    "moderately small @xmath78 picks secondary reggeon exchanges @xmath107 .",
    "the @xmath108 exchange in the @xmath109 scattering originates from dis off the valence quarks and is represented by color singlet @xmath40 exchange in the @xmath110-channel . because of the kinematical relation , @xmath111 , the @xmath108-reggeon exchange is most prominent in ddis at small @xmath49 and lowers the exponent @xmath112 in the fit @xmath113 , which is evident in the discussion of the proton spectra in @xcite and has indeed been observed by the h1 @xcite .",
    "eventually , one must be able to relate the @xmath108-exchange in ddis to the valence structure function of the proton and to calculate the structure function of the reggeon directly from pqcd @xcite .",
    "the existing triple - regge analyses @xcite rather use the model estimates for the flux of reggeons from hadronic diffraction and take for the reggeon the pion structure function .",
    "the major issue is the reggeon - pomeron interference .",
    "if one treats the pomeron and reggeon as `` orthogonal hadronic states '' , then the interference must be weak @xcite .",
    "to the contrary , the pqcd suggests @xcite a strong constructive reggeon - pomeron interference .",
    "the strong interference scenario is preferred by the h1 data shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the @xmath114 dependence of diffractive cross section is a new observable accessible with the advent of the lps era .",
    "the standard parameterization is @xmath115 .",
    "the so - defined diffraction slope @xmath116 is a fundamental measure of the interaction radius .",
    "for the two - body scattering @xmath117 , an essentially model - independent decomposition is @xmath118 , where @xmath119 come from the size of the @xmath120 transition vertex and @xmath121 comes from the interaction range proper .",
    "the values of @xmath119 depend strongly on the excitation energy in the @xmath122 transition .",
    "the situation in hadronic diffraction can be summarized as follows ( @xcite , see also the review @xcite ) : in the elastic case , @xmath123 , and for excitation of resonances and of the low - mass continuum states , @xmath124 , which fall into the broad category of _ exclusive _ diffraction , one finds @xmath125 and @xmath126 , here @xmath127 is the hadronic radius squared . in the hadronic elastic scattering",
    "@xmath128 4 - 6 gev@xmath66 , and typically @xmath129 gev@xmath66 .",
    "but if @xmath130,_i.e . _ , then @xmath131 .",
    "for instance , only the target proton size , and @xmath121 , contribute to @xmath116 in the triple - pomeron region of truly _ inclusive _ diffraction @xmath132 summed over all large - mass diffractive states , @xmath133(5 - 10 ) gev@xmath134 . here one finds @xmath1356 gev@xmath66 . in the double high - mass diffraction @xmath136 , when @xmath137 , one is left with @xmath1381.5 - 2 gev@xmath66 ( for the especially illuminating data on double diffraction see @xcite ) .",
    "the regge shrinkage of the diffraction , _ i.e. _ , the regge rise of @xmath139 with energy , was seen in all elastic scattering processes ; there is as yet no clear evidence for the shrinkage of the diffraction cone for diffraction dissociation .",
    "the remarkable feature of @xmath140 is its universality , because the dependence on the diffracting beam and diffractively produced state drops out ; the same @xmath141 gev@xmath66 is found for @xmath142 and for real photoproduction @xmath143 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the absence of the @xmath37 dependence and the same @xmath144 has been argued to hold for ddis at @xmath145 , _",
    "i.e. _ , at @xmath56 @xcite , which agrees with the first data from zeus lps : @xmath146 gev@xmath66 in ddis for 5 gev@xmath14720 gev@xmath66 @xcite and @xmath148 gev@xmath66 in real photoproduction @xcite .",
    "ddis at moderate and large @xmath49 is the tricky one . here",
    "the principal issues are : i ) what is the typical dipole size ( scanning radius ) in the @xmath149 transition , and ii ) where is the borderline between _ exclusive _ and _ inclusive _ ddis , _",
    "i.e. _ , what is the relevant excitation scale - the hadronic scale @xmath150 or @xmath151 ?",
    "we start with extreme case of exclusive diffraction : elastic production of vector mesons @xmath29 .",
    "the major predictions from the color dipole dynamics for elastic production are @xcite : i ) the qcd pomeron is a series of * moving * poles , the regge shrinkage persists at all @xmath37 and for all vector mesons we predict the rise of @xmath116 by @xmath152gev@xmath66 from the cern / fnal to hera energy ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "ii ) because of the shrinkage of the photon and the decrease of the scanning radius @xmath31 with @xmath37 , we predict @xmath153 , in agreement with the experiment , see fig .  3 ( a more detailed analysis reveals a nontrivial slowly decreasing contribution to @xmath154 which , however , is numerically small : @xmath155 @xcite ) .",
    "iii ) in the proton dissociative vector meson production one expects @xcite @xmath156 plus a contribution from the @xmath157 transition vertex which is small at large @xmath37 , which has been confirmed experimentally .",
    "for instance , h1 found @xmath158 for the proton dissociative electroproduction of the @xmath159 at @xmath160 gev@xmath66 @xcite and @xmath161 gev@xmath66 @xcite .",
    "iv ) restoration of flavor symmetry is predicted , _",
    "i.e. , _ the values of @xmath162 for different vector mesons must be to a good accuracy equal if production of different vector mesons is compared at equal @xmath163 .",
    "evidently , in the elastic production @xmath164(4 - 6 ) gev@xmath66 .",
    "the hera results give much too small @xmath165 .",
    "a likely explanation is an admixture of proton diffractive @xmath166 , in which @xmath1671.5 - 2 gev@xmath66 .",
    "the lps data can clarify the situation .",
    "if an anomalously small values of @xmath165 will persist , it will mean we do nt understand the size of protons as probed by gluons and will put in trouble many a models of diffractive production .",
    "because of the node in the radial wave function of radially excited @xmath168 , diffractive production @xmath169 is predicted to have many peculiarities : i ) strong suppression of the @xmath170 production ratio @xcite , which has been well confirmed experimentally , ii ) a counterintuitive @xmath171 , although @xmath168 has a larger radius , @xmath172 @xcite .",
    "for instance , for the @xmath173 production even the forward dip is possible !",
    "these predictions can be tested soon at hera .",
    "ddis at finite @xmath49 is excitation of continuum states , @xmath174 .",
    "if excitation of any continuum were an _ inclusive _ diffraction , then one could have expected @xmath175 , as in the large - mass hadronic diffraction and/or large - mass real photoproduction .",
    "this is not the case in ddis ; careful analysis of the @xmath40 excitation revealed @xcite nontrivial variation of @xmath176 about @xmath140 , shown in fig .",
    ", the excitation scale is set by @xmath151 rather than the quarkonium mass , so that the diffraction slope at fixed @xmath49 must not depend on @xmath37 .",
    "second , for @xmath177 one indeed finds an approximately flavor independent @xmath178 , whereas for light flavors @xmath179 is large , similar to the real photoproduction value of @xmath180 , as it has been anticipated in @xcite .",
    "third , for heavy flavors the @xmath49-dependence is weaker , because the effective dipole size in the @xmath181 vertex is smaller : @xmath182 .",
    "fourth , the decrease of @xmath183 with @xmath49 explains the decrease of @xmath184 at @xmath88 .",
    "the predictions @xcite for @xmath185 , shown in fig",
    ".  4 , are extremely interesting from the point of view of the exclusive - inclusive duality @xcite .",
    "this is a legitimate pqcd region , although a better treatment of the final state @xmath40 interaction is called . in the extreme limit of @xmath88 , _",
    "@xmath186 , the relevant dipole size is given by a small scanning radius @xmath31 and we predict @xmath187 . at @xmath188",
    "we predict a substantial drop of the diffraction slope .",
    "the drop is @xmath189 and comes from the rise of the quark helicity changing @xmath190 transition with the momentum transfer .",
    "the dropping @xmath116 nicely correlates with the prediction @xcite of a small diffraction slope for @xmath168 production . to test this prediction",
    ", it is necessary to experimentally separate the @xmath191 from @xmath192 contributions .",
    "otherwise the observed cross section is dominated by @xmath193 for which @xmath194 , which is uninteresting .",
    "these predictions can be tested soon with the lps data from zeus and h1 .",
    "testing the fundamental pqcd prediction @xcite of the dominance of @xmath193 at large @xmath49 is crucial for the qcd interpretation of ddis . the measurement of @xmath195 with lps is a good substitute for the measurement of @xmath196 by varying the beam energies , which is not possible at the moment .",
    "the key is the determination of the quark helicity changing and conserving amplitudes @xmath197 and @xmath198 @xcite .",
    "they both contribute to @xmath199 , whereas @xmath200 and @xmath201 .",
    "the azimuthal @xmath202 asymmetry is proportional to @xmath203 it provides a stringent test of the pqcd mechanism of ddis . in fig .",
    "5 we show the pqcd born approximation for @xmath204 at @xmath205 and @xmath206 gev@xmath134 ; the higher orders do not change the gross features of @xmath204 @xcite . for the @xmath192-dominated region of @xmath2070.85 - 0.9 , the asymmetry @xmath204 decreases with @xmath37 .",
    "in contrast , it rises with @xmath37 for the @xmath191-dominated @xmath2080.9 .",
    "the predicted asymmetry is quite large and is measurable with lps .",
    "azimuthal asymmetries for @xmath40 dijet production offer more tests of the mechanism of ddis .",
    "one interesting prediction @xcite is a dependence of @xmath176 on the angle @xmath209 between the @xmath40 plane and @xmath5 : @xmath210 . for light flavors we predict quite a substantial asymmetry , @xmath211 , with a nontrivial @xmath49 dependence which is different for @xmath191 and @xmath192 . for heavy flavors",
    "@xmath212 is smaller .",
    "the @xmath49 and flavor dependence of @xmath213 can be tested even without identification of dijets .",
    "it is sufficient to study the azimuthal correlation between the recoil protons and any secondary hadron in the @xmath22 debris .",
    "the azimuthal correlation between the @xmath8 plane and the @xmath40 dijet plane comes from the @xmath214 term in ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) .",
    "the sign of the @xmath215 term is opposite to that for the photon - gluon fusion - dominated jet production in the standard dis , which is an important signature of the qcd mechanism of ddis @xcite .",
    "the pqcd mechanism of ddis is well understood .",
    "new breakthroughs are expected with the forthcoming lps data .",
    "fundamental predictions for the diffraction slope , azimuthal asymmetries and @xmath191 can be tested .",
    "abnormally large higher twist effects , a vast variety of pqcd scales , the resulting breaking of diffractive factorization and inapplicability of the dglap evolution to diffractive structure functions have been firmly established theoretically .",
    "these findings did not make their way yet into monte carlo codes , which are still based on the discredited factorization approximation .",
    "furthermore , final state radiation in ddis and standard dis is different and conclusions from monte carlo comparisons can be quite misleading .",
