    "with the increasing demand for high data - rate services in emerging communication systems such as third and fourth generation ( 3 g and 4 g ) wireless networks , high - speed and high - quality data communications have become extremely necessary .",
    "wireless channel is the major challenge in providing high - speed and high - quality data communications .",
    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) technology is an attractive solution to overcome these limitations .",
    "the multiple - antenna front - end architecture design , traditionally results in greater complexity and higher hardware costs in the radio frequency ( rf ) section @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the complexity and cost generally increase with the increasing number of antennas .",
    "one simplifying and cost - reducing solution may be the utilization of a single rf front - end , where a single rf path is used instead of multiple parallel rf chains @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition , antenna selection ( as ) technique is a current method for dealing with this issue @xcite-@xcite . by using this approach ,",
    "some of the available antennas at the transmitter and/or receiver are selected . then",
    ", mimo systems can use fewer rf chains than a number of transmit and/or receive antennas , which results in lower complexity and cost . as can be implemented at the transmitter and/or receiver . in these schemes ,",
    "an antenna can be selected to maximize the channel capacity @xcite or to maximize the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) @xcite .",
    "likewise , cross - layer based as approaches have been proposed recently @xcite-@xcite .",
    "multimedia applications such as video conferencing , require low end - to - end delay @xcite .",
    "for these type of applications delay becomes a critically important parameter for quality - of - service ( qos ) provisioning .",
    "once a delay requirement is violated , the corresponding data packet is discarded . in an appropriate channel condition ,",
    "transmission with high data rate can be achieved through the wireless environment .",
    "in contrast , in a severe condition , the data rate decreases and probably becomes zero .",
    "due to this , the statistical delay boundaries capable of characterizing the qos requirements is employed for the delay - sensitive applications . for this purpose , effective capacity is defined as a maximum constant arrival rate that a wireless channel can support in order to guarantee the delay qos requirements @xcite .",
    "in contrast to shannon capacity without any restrictions on complexity and delay , the effective capacity ensures the maximum probabilistic delay for the incoming user traffic in the network @xcite .    for the wireless communication networks ,",
    "the theory of effective capacity is proposed in @xcite and a closed - form solution is extracted for the correlated rayleigh channel in the low - snr regime .",
    "this new concept is completely discussed with a different viewpoint in @xcite for a generic source over correlated rayleigh channels .",
    "the authors assume gaussian distribution for the accumulated service rate of the channel which leads to the new result for the effective capacity over correlated rayleigh channels . following these fundamental research ,",
    "the theory of effective capacity has been conducted in various systems and problems @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the system throughput in a single - input single - output ( siso ) channel subject to a given statistical delay qos constraint is studied in @xcite .",
    "then , an optimal power and rate adaptation policy which maximize the system throughput is derived .",
    "the discussion is also extended to a more practical scenario with variable - power adaptive modulation over both block fading and markov correlated fading channels .",
    "in addition , a similar problem is considered in a mimo system in @xcite . in @xcite , a novel framework based on the effective capacity theory for the cross - layer analysis and design of wireless networks combining adaptive modulation and coding ( amc ) at the physical layer with an automatic repeat request ( arq ) protocol at the data - link layer is proposed . moreover , a delay constrained performance of a cognitive radio and cognitive radio relay channels is evaluated in @xcite and @xcite respectively . in these papers",
    "the authors derive an optimal rate and power adaptation policy for the secondary user , which maximize the effective capacity subject to satisfying interference - power limitations on the primary user .",
    "an effective capacity based call admission control ( cac ) with adaptive modulation technique to manage the self - similar traffic in a wireless ip - based network is also introduced in @xcite .",
    "mimo systems involving as technique at their transmitter or receiver , reveal significant advantages in practical communications .",
    "hence , in this paper we study the performance of a mimo system with the receive antenna selection ( ras ) or transmit antenna selection ( tas ) scheme for the delay sensitive user traffics .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , there is no prior work in this subject . here , we assume an uncorrelated quasi - static rayleigh fading channel in two different cases with the ras and tas schemes . in the ras case ,",
    "since there is no channel state information ( csi ) available at the transmitter , as at the transmitter is not possible .",
    "thus , one antenna with the maximum instantaneous snr is selected at the receiver . on the other hand ,",
    "when the csi is available at the transmitter , one antenna is chosen there .",
    "we select an antenna which maximizes the corresponding instantaneous snr at the receiver . in order to improve the performance ,",
    "an optimal power adaptation policy is considered for the selected antenna . in both cases with the ras and tas , we derive a closed - form expression for the effective capacity of the system .",
    "finally , the optimal power and the effective capacity of the mimo system with tas scheme are analyzed in two asymptotic cases with the loose and high qos constraints . in the former case with the loose qos requirement ,",
    "we indicate that the optimal power converges to a constant value with the high snr assumption",
    ". therefore the effective capacity with and without power adaptation are nearly the same .",
    "consequently , the power adaptation policy does not have an advantage hare .",
    "we also show that the effective capacity approaches to the ergodic capacity and an exact closed - form expression for the ergodic capacity is derived here . the ergodic capacity can be viewed as an average of the shannon capacity . on the other hand in the second case when high qos is required , we observe that the tas scheme can keep the effective capacity near the ergodic capacity too .",
    "this result is achieved while in a usual circumstance the effective capacity decreases when the qos requirement increases .",
    "therefore this can be so attractive for applications with the high qos demands .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : first , the system model is introduced in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] provides a brief introduction to the effective capacity concept .",
    "the effective capacity of a mimo system with both ras and tas schemes are explained in section [ sec:4 ] .",
    "then , the analysis of an optimal power control policy and the effective capacity in two asymptotic cases are also proposed here .",
    "finally , the simulation results are presented in section [ sec:5 ] , and section [ sec:6 ] concludes the paper .",
    "the system model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "first , information data from upper layers arrive to the data link layer where they are stored as an equal - length packet in the buffer .",
    "the packets are split up into bit streams and delivered to the physical layer . in the physical layer",
    "the bit streams are modulated with amc scheme and make a frame .",
    "then , with the ras technique , the frames are transmitted from @xmath0 transmit antennas and received by the selected antenna at the receiver . however , with the tas scheme , one antenna is chosen and transmits the frames .",
    "in such a case , all @xmath1 receive antennas capture the transmitted frames . at the physical layer in the receiver ,",
    "the frames are demodulated and passed to the data link layer .",
    "then , at the data link layer some error detection algorithms such as arq protocol are executed which is not considered in this paper .",
    "after that , data link layer sends the transmitted information data to upper layers . the detailed explanations of physical and data link layers are as follows .",
    "the physical layer includes @xmath0 transmit and @xmath1 receive antennas in a mimo channel .",
    "the link between each transmit and receive antenna is an uncorrelated quasi - static rayleigh fading channel .",
    "we further assume that an ideal amc scheme is implemented at the transmitter .",
    "therefore , data can leave the transmitter with the instantaneous channel capacity rate . in the physical layer",
    "we adopt two different scenarios for the selection ; ras or tas . in the ras technique , we select one antenna with the maximum instantaneous snr at the receiver . in this case",
    "the available power is identically distributed over the @xmath0 transmit antennas .",
    "in contrast in the tas scheme , we select one antenna at the transmitter which maximizes the corresponding instantaneous snr at the receiver . for further improvement , an optimal power can be used for the selected antenna .    at the data link layer of the transmitter , a simple first - input first - output ( fifo ) buffer",
    "is assumed @xcite .",
    "the source process of the network has a constant rate .",
    "therefore , the buffer fills with a constant arrival rate and it is served with the instantaneous mimo channel capacity rate . since the channel capacity is time - varying , the service rate of the buffer is not constant .",
    "hence , each packet needs to stay at the buffer for a while before transmission and this waiting time depends on the channel state .",
    "we also assume that enough packets are available in the buffer for transmission .    in the quasi - static fading ,",
    "mimo channel coefficients are constant during a frame time duration @xmath2 . in this case",
    "the instantaneous snr is defined as @xmath3 where in the ras case , @xmath4 and @xmath5 denotes the channel coefficient between the @xmath6th transmit and a receive antenna .",
    "however , in the tas case , @xmath7 and @xmath5 denotes the channel coefficient between a transmit and the @xmath6th receive antenna .",
    "in addition , @xmath8 represents the average snr ; @xmath9 is the mean transmitted power ; @xmath10 is the total spectral bandwidth of the system and @xmath11 stands for the power density per dimension of the additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) and cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath12 can be written as : @xmath13 @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denote the gamma and the lower incomplete gamma function , respectively . in as problems , we usually deal with the ordered random variables .",
    "here @xmath17 denotes @xmath18 random variables defined in ( [ eq : gammak ] ) , and @xmath19 represents ordered random variables where @xmath20 . in the ras case where the antenna with the maximum instantaneous snr is selected , @xmath21 and similarly in the tas case @xmath22 .",
    "the pdf of @xmath23 and @xmath24 is given by @xcite @xmath25 where for ease of notation , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are replaced by @xmath28 and @xmath29 in ( [ eq : generalospdf ] ) and the subsequent expressions . for the maximum instantaneous snr we also have @xcite @xmath30 this pdf will be employed later to derive the effective capacity .",
    "despite the time - varying nature of wireless channels , network service providers must guarantee a specified qos to satisfy their customers who have real - time multimedia traffics . in @xcite , wu and negi defined the effective capacity as the maximum constant arrival rate that a given service process can support in order to guarantee a qos requirement specified by the qos exponent @xmath31 . for a dynamic queuing system with stationary and ergodic arrival and service processes , under sufficient conditions , the queue length process @xmath32 converges in distribution to a random variable @xmath33 such that @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 determines a certain threshold , and therefore , we have the following approximation : @xmath36 for a large @xmath35 . for a small @xmath35",
    "the following approximation is shown to be more accurate @xcite : @xmath37 where @xmath38 represents the non - empty buffer probability .",
    "in addition , for the delay experienced by a packet as the main qos metric , we have a similar probability function as @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 indicates the tolerated delay , @xmath41 is a delay - bound , and @xmath42 is jointly determined by both arrival and service processes . the statistical delay constraint in ( [ eq : b ] )",
    "represents the qos which has to be guaranteed for the delay sensitive traffic sources .",
    "it is apparent that the qos exponent @xmath31 has an important role here .",
    "larger @xmath31 corresponds to more strict qos constraint , while smaller @xmath31 implies looser qos requirements .",
    "effective capacity provides the maximum constant arrival rate that can be supported by the time - varying wireless channel under the statistical delay constraint ( [ eq : b ] ) .",
    "since the average arrival rate is equal to the average departure rate when the buffer is in a steady - state @xcite , the effective capacity can be viewed as the maximum throughput in the presence of such a constraint .",
    "the effective capacity is defined in ( * ? ? ?",
    "12 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "6 ) in the correlated channels . however in the uncorrelated case it reduces to @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the time - varying rate of the channel and @xmath45 denotes the expectation . for a specific application with a given statistical delay requirement",
    ", the qos exponent @xmath31 can be determined from ( [ eq : b ] ) .",
    "then , the maximum constant arrival rate of the sources that a wireless channel can support in order to guarantee the given qos , is determined from ( [ eq : generalec ] ) . @xmath44 and the effective capacity @xmath46",
    "are further discussed for two different as schemes in the next section .",
    "in the mimo system with as technique , we select one antenna at the receiver or one antenna at the transmitter in the ras or tas scheme respectively . single antenna selection is the simplest method for implementing this technique @xcite . in order to eliminate practical issues , such as mutual coupling , spatial correlation of antennas and inaccurate time - synchronization of the antennas , single antenna selection",
    "is extensively considered in the literatures @xcite-@xcite . in a mimo system with the single as",
    ", we deal with a multiple - input single - output ( miso ) system in the ras case , and a single - input multiple - output ( simo ) system in the tas case .",
    "the effective capacity of these systems are studied in the following sections more precisely .      in the ras case with @xmath0 transmit and",
    "one selected receive antennas , @xmath47 represent the instantaneous snrs of @xmath1 available receive antennas and @xmath48 show the ordered random variables where @xmath49 . here we choose one antenna with the maximum instantaneous snr .",
    "this means that the corresponding antenna to @xmath50 will be used for transmission .",
    "this antenna has a maximum capacity too .",
    "now , the service rate in a miso system can be denoted by @xcite @xmath51 where @xmath10 is the total spectral bandwidth and @xmath2 is the frame duration . by inserting ( [ eq : misocapacity ] ) into ( [ eq : generalec ] ) , the effective capacity can be found according to @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",

    "we have defined @xmath59 in section [ sec:4 ] as @xmath144 with @xmath145 and arbitrary number of transmit antenna @xmath0 , we have @xmath146 , and therefore , @xmath147 for @xmath148 and @xmath149 . in this case",
