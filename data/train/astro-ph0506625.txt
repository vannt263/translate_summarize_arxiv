    "in spite of the recent vast progress both in observational and theoretical studies , our understanding of the physics of galaxy formation and evolution is still far from sufficient .    the cosmic star formation ( sf ) history , introduced by @xcite and developed by subsequent studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , has always drawn much attention .",
    "now the observations reach up to @xmath2 ( e.g , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in such studies , the role of dust has been increasingly recognized when we try to understand the evolution of galaxies in the context of cosmic star formation history , because dust grains absorb stellar light and re - emit it in the far infrared ( fir ) .",
    "even a small amount of dust can lead to a significant underestimation of the star formation rate ( sfr ) @xcite .",
    "indeed , there is another extreme category of high-@xmath3 galaxies which have large amount of dust and are extremely luminous in the fir and submillimetre ( submm ) wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "heavily hidden sf is suggested in these galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "further , from physical point of view , dust grains are one of the fundamental ingredients in the activity of galaxies .",
    "since they are formed in a variety of environments ranging from explosive ejecta of novae and supernovae to the outflowing gas of evolved low - mass stars , the dust formation is closely related to the sf activity @xcite .",
    "moreover , the existence of dust is crucial in the physical process of galaxy formation and evolution through the formation of molecular hydrogen ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the dust itself plays a leading part in the physics of sf activity in galaxies in the whole period of the cosmic history .",
    "then , how about very young galaxies in the early universe at @xmath4 ?",
    "it is often assumed , without deliberation , that the effect of dust is negligible for such young galaxies , because of their low metallicities .",
    "there is , however , a good counter - intuitive example in the local universe : a local dwarf star - forming galaxy  has a very young stellar age ( @xmath5 ) and low metallicity ( @xmath6 ) , but has a heavily embedded active star formation and strong continuum radiation in n  mir wavelength regime @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are increasing number of observations suggesting the existence of dust in high-@xmath3 systems such as lyman @xmath7 systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) or qsos ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .    to produce dust effectively in such a young system",
    ", the dust enrichment should have occurred primarily in the ejecta of supernovae ( sne ) , especially type ii supernova ( sn ii ) explosions , because the lifetime of the progenitor is short enough ( @xmath8 ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "recent theoretical studies claim the possibility of very massive stars for the first generation stars , which end their lives as pair - instability supernovae ( pisne ) @xcite .",
    "we should also take into account for the pisne to study the very early evolution of dust .",
    "recently , the dust formation in sne ejecta has been observationally supported ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for investigating the properties of dust in details , theoretical predictions for the amount and composition of dust",
    "are required .",
    "so far , some theoretical models of dust production by sne have been developed .",
    "* hereafter tf01 ) showed that the dust mass produced by a sn ii is 0.10.4 @xmath9 applying the theory of nucleation and grain growth by @xcite . in the calculations",
    ", they assumed an adiabatic cooling in the ejecta with uniform gas density as well as elemental composition within he - core .",
    "they also found that sne form amorphous carbon with size around 300   and silicate grains around 1020  .",
    "@xcite extended the progenitor mass range to the regime of pisne ( 140260 @xmath9 ) and found that 1060 @xmath9 of dust forms per pisn .",
    "the grain radius depends on the species and is distributed from 0.001 to 0.3 @xmath10 m .",
    "recently , @xcite ( hereafter n03 ) carefully took into account the radial density profile and the temperature evolution in the calculation of the dust mass in the ejecta of sne ii and pisne .",
    "n03 showed that the produced dust species depends strongly on the mixing within sne .",
    "in particular , carbon dust is not produced in the mixed case , because the carbon and oxygen are mixed and combined to form co molecules .",
    "on the contrary , it forms in unmixed sn , since there is a carbon - rich region at a certain location in the ejecta of sne .",
    "in addition , n03 predicts a dust mass larger than that of tf01 for sne ii .",
    "the amount of dust produced in sne is thus still a matter of debate .",
    "@xcite adopted a dust production smaller than those of tf01 or n03 in their theoretical calculation , in line with ir observations at the time . on the other hand ,",
    "various observational efforts have been devoted to constrain the dust production efficiency of sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these results range from @xmath11 to @xmath12 per sn , and n03 dust production seems consistent with the upper range of these observational constraints .",
    "however , in these observational evaluations , a large uncertainty still remains due to the uncertainties in the estimation of dust mass in cas  a caused by the foreground contamination @xcite , although the evidence for dust in some sn remnants ( sn1987a and kepler ) is still pointing towards sn origin .",
    "thus , further close interaction between theoretical and observational works is required to overcome the uncertainties and obtain a reasonable picture of dust production in sne .    in order to examine the dust properties of such high-@xmath3 galaxies ,",
    "the most direct observable is their spectral energy distribution ( sed ) , especially at the fir wavelengths . @xcite modeled the evolution of fir luminosity and dust temperature in a young starburst on the basis of sne ii grain formation model of tf01 .",
    "@xcite ( t03 ) subsequently constructed a model of infrared ( ir ) spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of galaxies starting from the model of @xcite .",
    "t03 , for the first time , properly consider the dust size distribution peculiar to the very early stage of galaxy evolution in the model of the ir sed of very young galaxies , and successfully reproduced the peculiar mir sed of  ( though their result seems to have overestimated the fir continuum ) .",
    "@xcite ( t04 ) applied the t03 model to the lyman - break galaxies .",
    "they found that the suggested hot dust in the lyman - break galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) can be naturally explained by the t03 model .",
    "since these works are based on tf01 conjecture , the dust formation model used is based on the classical nucleation theory @xcite .",
    "recently , however , the importance of nonequilibrium ( non - steady state ) effects on the dust grain formation has been recognized in various astrophysical contexts ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition , n03 found that the radial density profile of the sn progenitor and the temperature evolution of the ejecta also affect the dust grain formation .",
    "hence , now is the time to take into account these concepts to further investigate the dust emission from young galaxies . in this work ,",
    "we construct a new model of ir sed of extremely young galaxies based on n03 sn dust formation model . starting from the size distribution and the amount of dust predicted by n03",

    "the results are presented in figures  [ fig : sed_30pc ] and [ fig : sed_100pc ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : sed_30pc ] is the sed of a galaxy with @xmath22 , while figure  [ fig : sed_100pc ] is the one for @xmath23 .",
    "we calculated the evolution of the sed in the age range of @xmath24  yr . in a very young phase ( @xmath25  yr ) , unmixed - case sed has an enhanced n  mir continuum .",
    "after @xmath26  yr , the n  mir continuum is extinguished by the self - absorption in the case of @xmath27  pc .",
    "in contrast , the self - absorption is not significant for @xmath28  pc .    in both cases ,",
    "the seds have their peaks at a wavelength @xmath29 m , which is much shorter than those of dusty giant galaxies at @xmath30 detected by scuba . at submillimetre wavelengths ,",
    "the shape of the continuum is very similar to each other for mixed and unmixed cases , though the unmixed case predicts stronger fluxes by a factor of two .",
    "this is explained by the grain size distributions of the unmixed and mixed cases : carefully examining figure  [ fig : dust_size ] , we see that the largest - size dust grains are more abundant for the unmixed - case size distribution .",
    "it means that larger grains contribute more significantly than smaller ones .",
    "since larger grains radiate their energy at longer wavelengths , the total sed has a stronger fir - submm continuum .    as a whole ,",
    "our model seds are less luminous than those of t03 by a factor of 23 .",
    "this is due to the difference in considered grain species , and more importantly , also due to the improvement of the treatment of @xmath19 at the uv ; @xmath19 was approximated to be unity in t03 .",
    "also t03 treated the size dependence of @xmath19 by a simple scaling law , which was not very accurate .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : q_abs ] , the size dependence of @xmath18 can not be described by a simple scaling law , especially at the mir ( see , e.g. , si , fe , and fes ) .",
    "we , in this work , used the exact value of @xmath18 in all the wavelengths .",
    "since some elements have a very small value for @xmath19 at the uv regime , the total absorption probability of uv photons is smaller than that of t03 .",

    "the dust species treated here are much more detailed than those of t03 . in order to see the detailed contributors to the total seds , we show the individual sed of each species in figure  [ fig : sed_contribution ] .",
    "we show the sed with the age of burst @xmath32  yr , where the effect of self - absorption is negligible .    both in unmixed and mixed cases , the smallest dust grain species is al@xmath15o@xmath16 ( figure  [ fig : dust_size ] )",
    ". however , because of its small fraction in mass ( figure  [ fig : dust_amount ] ) , al@xmath15o@xmath16 contributes to the total sed very little .",
    "the main contributor to the ( unextinguished ) n  mir continuum is si for unmixed case and fe@xmath16o@xmath17 in mixed case , respectively .",
    "these species are the second smallest grains . for the unmixed case ,",
    "since the emissivity of si grains with the size of @xmath33 is much smaller than that of fe@xmath16o@xmath17 at @xmath34 m , the grain temperature becomes much higher than that of fe@xmath16o@xmath17 , which makes the very strong n  mir continuum emission .",
    "on the contrary , since @xmath19 of fe@xmath16o@xmath17 is large , the resultant sed for the mixed case does not have a strong n  mir continuum .    at @xmath35 m , several species contribute equally to the sed in unmixed case , while sio@xmath15 play a dominant role for mixed case . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "the main contributors to the sed are mg@xmath15sio@xmath17 and amorphous carbon for the unmixed case , and mgsio@xmath16 and mg@xmath15sio@xmath17 in mixed case .",
    "in addition , especially at @xmath36 m , fes ( unmixed ) and fe@xmath16o@xmath17 ( mixed ) are also important because of their shallow slope of the extinction efficiency at longer wavelength regime .",

    "detailed discussions of the extinction curves in the optical wavelength regime are given in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : ext ] presents the evolution of the ir opacity for a young galaxy with the age of @xmath39yr ( from the bottom to the top ) . for the case of @xmath27  pc ,",
    "the extinction becomes almost unity at @xmath40 m when the age is @xmath26  yr .",
    "hence , after this age , the n  mir regime of the sed becomes optically thick , and this makes the continuum extinguished in figure  [ fig : sed_30pc ] . on the other hand , for @xmath28  pc ,",

    "this makes the extinction stronger for the unmixed - case galaxies at n  mir .",
    "in addition , the mir bumps at 10 and @xmath44 m are less prominent for unmixed case .    comparing these ir extinction curves with t03 model",
    ", we find that the amount of the extinction is smaller than that of t03 by a factor of 210 , depending on the wavelength and unmixed / mixed production .",
    "this is explained by the discussion presented in subsection  [ subsec : sed_construction ] : t03 supposed silicates and carbon grains as the constituents of dust grains from sne . since their @xmath19 is larger than the other species predicted by n03 , the total extinction becomes smaller in this work .",
    "as for the shape of the curve , the extinction curve for the mixed model resembles that of t03 extinction curves , while the curve for the unmixed model is qualitatively different at mir , because of the weak mir bump features and the lack of the mir dip mentioned above .",

    "the adopted age is @xmath45  yr as a representative , but the contribution is constant with time .    for the extinction curve of the unmixed case , bump features at mir are relatively weak ( figure  [ fig : ext ] ) . similar to those of the galactic ir extinction curve",
    ", they are due to silicate grains . in the unmixed - model extinction ,",
    "the bumps are dominated by mg@xmath15sio@xmath17 , and the contribution from mgsio@xmath16 is not important .",
    "we also find a strong contribution from amorphous carbon grains which have very smooth dependence of @xmath19 on wavelength .",
    "they makes the silicate features rather weak , because of their comparable contribution with mg@xmath15sio@xmath17 .",
    "we note that the amorphous carbon does not have any dip at @xmath46 m .",
    "further , large grains of si have a large @xmath19 at these wavelength regime .",
    "we find that both the amorphous carbon and si grains equally contribute to the total extinction at n  mir , and these species plug up the mir dip of mg@xmath15sio@xmath17 . at nir wavelengths close to @xmath47 m",

    "we next see the mixed case . in this case ,",
    "mgsio@xmath16 and mg@xmath15sio@xmath17 equally contribute to the total extinction around the mir bumps .",
    "in contrast to the unmixed case , there is no species which fill up the dip of silicates , hence we see clear silicate bump features and dip in the ir extinction curve . in the n ",

    "the contribution from al@xmath15o@xmath16 is not important at any wavelength .",

    "the behavior of the sed evolution of lbg is qualitatively very similar to that of a dwarf - like forming galaxy with @xmath28  pc ( i.e. , a weak nir continuum and a strong m ",
    "fir emission is commonly seen in both ) .",
    "this is because both the uv photon number density and dust number density are in the same order for an lbg and dwarf galaxy ( @xmath28  pc ) . since the ir luminosity depends on the dust column density , the total luminosity is different , but the shape of the sed is determined by the balance between the densities of uv photons and dust grains , they are similar with each other as for the shape .",
    "the difference between the seds of the unmixed and mixed cases is small , and they give almost the same result especially in the m  fir .",
    "this is explained as follows : the most prominent difference between the two is the n  mir continuum , which is produced mainly by stochastic heating of grains . if the uv photon density is low , they are almost always in the lowest temperature state because the incidence of a uv photon is less frequent . in this case",
    "the n  mir continuum from stochastically heated dust does not contribute the continuum significantly , and the global sed shape is determined by larger grains in the equilibrium with the ambient uv radiation field . under such condition , they are similar in shape with each other .",
    "thus , we see that it will be difficult to determine which scenario of dust production is correct from the observation of lbgs .",
    "the flux density of a source at observed frequency , @xmath75 is obtained by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the luminosity distance corresponding to a redshift @xmath3 , and @xmath75 and @xmath78 are observed and emitted frequency , respectively .",
    "we show the observed ir / submm seds of lbgs at @xmath79 , 3 , and 4 in figure  [ fig : lbg_obs ] . for simplicity",
    "we only show the sed with the age of @xmath41  yr .",
    "the thick black short horizontal lines indicate the 3-@xmath80 detection limits for 8-hour observation by alma ( atacama large millimeter array ) . here",
    "we assumed 64 antennas and three wavelength bands , 450 , 850 , and @xmath81 m . we also show the 3-@xmath80 source confusion limit of _ herschel _ at 75 , 160 , 250 , and 350@xmath82 m bands by thick gray horizontal lines .",
    "these limits are based on ` the photometric criterion ' of @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite .    as discussed in t04 ,",
    "the detectability of lbgs is not strongly dependent on their redshifts .",
    "the predicted ir luminosity is factor of two smaller than that of t04 , hence it is more difficult to detect lbgs than the discussion in t04 : we need roughly four times longer integration time than that derived from t04 , if we fix all the other conditions .",
    "detection at @xmath83 m seems impossible for moderate - sfr lbgs .",
    "however at longer wavelengths , if the age @xmath84 and @xmath85 , lbgs can be detected at a wide range of redshifts in the submm by alma deep survey . in the fir , _ herschel",
    "_ will detect the dust emission from lbgs at @xmath86 , but difficult at higher-@xmath3 . since the sed does not differ for the unmixed or mixed dust formation , our evaluation of the observability of lbgs holds both for the mixed and unmixed dust formation .",
    "based on the above discussions , we give a brief consideration on the observation of very high-@xmath3 galaxies ( @xmath1 ) here .",
    "direct observation of such galaxies are of vital importance to explore the physics of galaxy formation .",
    "first , assume a lbg at these redshifts .",
    "figure  [ fig : lbg_highz ] shows such a situation .",
    "we assumed the same physical parameters for lbgs . from figure",
    "[ fig : lbg_highz ] , we find that lbg - like objects can be detectable even at @xmath87 if @xmath88 . at @xmath89",
    ", it may be more difficult , but might be possible to detect lbgs with very high sfr , by an alma ultra - deep survey with much longer integration time than eight hour",
    ".    however , it may not be reasonable to assume a galaxy like lbgs at @xmath87 because they are rather massive system in general ( @xmath90 ) , and , from the modern cosmological viewpoint , such a massive system is very rare at such a high-@xmath3 , young universe .",
    "here we discuss an object less massive than lbgs . in modern hierarchical structure formation scenarios",
    ", it would be more reasonable to assume a small , subgalactic clump as a first forming galaxy .",
    "consider a dark halo of mass @xmath91 , then it is expected to contain a gas with mass @xmath92 . for this purpose",
    ", we calculate the seds for a dwarf star - forming galaxy .",
    "if gas collapses on the free - fall timescale with an efficiency of @xmath93 ( we assume @xmath94 ) , we obtain the following evaluation of the sfr @xcite : @xmath95 \\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath96\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is the hydrogen number density",
    ". then we have @xmath98\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we consider @xmath99 , we have @xmath100 . in addition , as we see below , an extremely high-@xmath3 galaxy observed by _ hst _",
    "has a very compact morphology @xcite .",
    "we also mention that , from a theoretical side , high-@xmath3 galaxies are suggested to be dense and compact compared to nearby galaxies @xcite .",
    "hence , it may be reasonable to assume a same type of galaxy as local dwarfs discussed in section  [ subsubsec : local ] .",
    "thus , we consider a dwarf galaxy with @xmath101 as an example , and we adopt @xmath21  pc and 100  pc . the age is set to be @xmath45  yr .",
    "if the age is older , they will become easier to detect if a constant sfr takes place .",
    "we show the expected seds for such galaxies at @xmath102 , 10 , and 20 in figures  [ fig : dwarf_highz_30pc ] and [ fig : dwarf_highz_100pc ] .",
    "as expected , it seems almost impossible to detect such objects by _ herschel _ or alma .",
    "there is , however , a hope to observe such a small forming galactic clump directly : gravitational lensing works very well as a natural huge telescope .",
    "for example ,  is an ideal case of a lensed lbg @xcite , and more recently , a small star - forming galaxy has been detected by _",
    "hst _ and _ spitzer _ observations @xcite .",
    "hence , we can expect a forming galaxy which is intrinsically small and faint but magnified by a gravitational potential of a cluster of galaxies .",
    "if we assume a lens magnification factor of 40 , such a small galaxy becomes detectable .",
    "this is depicted by the thin lines in figures  [ fig : dwarf_highz_30pc ] and [ fig : dwarf_highz_100pc ] .",
    "since the expected sed of such a compact dwarf galaxy has a strong mir continuum at their rest frame , it can be feasible to detect at the fir in the observed frame .",
    "indeed , at @xmath102 they appear above the confusion limits of _",
    "since the confusion limit of _ herschel _ may be , in fact , very difficult to reach in actual observations , a cooled fir space telescope is more suitable for such observation , and this will be a strong scientific motivation for a future project like _ spica_. in the fir wavelength regime ( @xmath103 ) , the seds of unmixed and mixed cases might be distinguishable .",
    "if a fir spectroscopy is performed , which picture of dust production is plausible might be examined . at higher-@xmath3",
    ", they can be detectable by alma survey .",
    "even at @xmath89 , they can be detected by a standard 8-hour survey of alma , if a lensing takes place .",
    "it is interesting to note that , at @xmath104 , the peak of their sed locates at the wavelength range where the detection limits of both _",
    "herschel _ and alma are not very good .",
    "a new effective ( probably space ) facility should be developed to overcome this difficulty in observation .",
    "for this line of study , we must estimate how frequently such lensing events occur for high-@xmath3 objects .",
    "suppose a cluster of galaxies at @xmath105 whose dynamical mass @xmath106 is @xmath107 and whose mass distribution obeys the singular isothermal sphere .",
    "we denote the strong lensing cross section , i.e. , the area of the region in the source plane for which the resulting magnification by a cluster is larger than @xmath10 , as @xmath108 .",
    "@xcite presented @xmath108 as a function of @xmath106 for @xmath109 .",
    "since @xmath110 [ @xmath111 is the angular - diameter distance between the lens and the source ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) ] @xcite , we can convert their result to our condition and obtain @xmath112 on the source plane .. ] this result is almost independent of the source redshifts . setting the limiting flux density @xmath113jy and using the number counts of @xcite for galaxies at @xmath114",
    ", we have an expected number of galaxies suffering a strong lensing to be @xmath115 .",
    "thus , we expect at least a few strongly lensed ir galaxies to this survey depth .    to have a concrete idea for the observational strategy , we must consider an important aspect of the lensing .",
    "it is known that the gravitational lensing affects the galaxy number counts in two opposite directions : i ) it magnifies the flux density of galaxies , and ii ) it stretches the sky area and decreases their number density on the sky .",
    "this is called the ` magnification bias ' @xcite .",
    "the unlensed number count @xmath116 is generally approximated by a power law @xmath117 then , by denoting the magnification factor as @xmath10 , we obtain the lensed number counts @xmath118 as @xmath119 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "equation  ( [ eq : lens ] ) shows that whether the number counts increases or decreases depends on the slope of the counts , @xmath120 : if @xmath121 lensing works as an enhancement of the counts . since the slope of the number counts of such galaxies",
    "is expected to be steeper than @xmath122 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the source density on the image plane will increase ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "thus , we are confident that the lensing will work as a really useful tool to detect forming small galaxies with dust emission .",
    "dust plays various important roles even in the very early phase of galaxy evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in such a young phase with a typical age less than @xmath70  yr , dust is predominantly supplied by sne . with the aid of a new physical model of dust production by sne developed by n03",
    ", we constructed a model of dust emission from a very young galaxies according to t03 .",
    "n03 carefully took into account the radial density profile and the temperature evolution in the calculation of the dust formation in the ejecta of sne ii and pisne .",
    "they also showed that the produced dust species depends strongly on the mixing within sne .",
    "we treated both unmixed and mixed cases and calculated the ir sed of young galaxies for both cases .",
    "the seds constructed from n03 dust production are less luminous than those by t03 model by a factor of 23 .",
    "this difference is due to the improvement in the treatment of @xmath19 at uv and the considered grain species .",
    "the sed for the unmixed case is found to have a strong n  mir continuum radiation in its early phase of the evolution ( @xmath0yr ) compared with that for the mixed case .",
    "mir continuum is due to the emission from si grains , which only exist in the species of the unmixed dust production .",
    "we also calculated the ir extinction curves for young galaxies .",
    "n03 dust gives a weaker extinction than that of t03 model because of the small relative number of very small dust grains .",
    "this is also the cause of the smaller ir luminosity of the present model . for the unmixed case , nir extinction",
    "is dominated by large grain of si and amorphous carbon , and silicate features are less prominent compared to the curve given by t03 . on the contrary , the extinction curve of the mixed case has a similar shape with that of t03 .",
    "the sed of a local starbursting dwarf galaxy , , was calculated .",
    "recent _ spitzer _",
    "observations @xcite have implied a hotter dust than previously thought .",
    "our present model sed naturally reproduces the strong n  mir continuum and the lack of cold fir emission of .",
    "we found that only the sed of unmixed case can reproduce the n ",
    "mir continuum of this galaxy .",
    "hence , as for , the unmixed dust production is preferred .",
    "it will be interesting to proceed this line of study for higher-@xmath3 galaxies .",
    "a prediction for the sed of another typical nearby star - forming dwarf galaxy , , was then made . since  is dominated by very young star formation",
    ", we may adopt the model to this galaxy . using the dust species from n03 with this model",
    ", we find a weaker fir emission than that of t03 .",
    "mir continuum is also expected to be much weaker than that of t03 sed .",
    "we also calculated the evolution of the sed of lbgs .",
    "for the parameters of lbgs , the unmixed and mixed picture does not affect the appearance of the sed .",
    "hence , if we combine our model with the knowledge obtained from optical observations , the observability of lbgs at submillimetre wavelengths are robust conclusion independent of the details of the sne dust production theory .    finally , we considered the observations of forming galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "if there exist lbg - like galaxies at these redshifts , they can be detected at @xmath123 by alma 8-hour survey if @xmath124 . for small forming galaxies or subgalactic clumps , it is almost impossible to detect their intrinsic flux by alma or by _",
    "however , the gravitational lensing is found to be a very effective tool to detect such small star - forming galaxies at @xmath1 .",
