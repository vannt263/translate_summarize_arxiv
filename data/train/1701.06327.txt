    "since the time when wheeler coined the name _ superheavy nuclei _ ( shn ) in 1955 @xcite , our knowledge of the  very heavy nuclei \" has become more extensive and systematic . during the last 60 years",
    "the heaviest known nucleus limit has been extended from @xmath3md ( 1955 ) @xcite to @xmath4og ( 2006 ) @xcite , and the properties of shn have been studied mostly in the region of prolate deformations . in this region ,",
    "the energy surfaces of shn reveal two paths to fission : a reflection - symmetric path corresponding to elongated fission fragments ( sef ) and the reflection - asymmetric path with elongated fission fragments ( aef ) , which bifurcates from the sef path after the first barrier , see e.g. ref .",

    "theoretically , the properties of shn have been studied much less in the oblate region than in the prolate region , with a few exceptions , such as the study on super - deformed - oblate shn at quadrupole moment @xmath6 to @xmath7  b @xcite . within the self - consistent constraint skyrme - hartree - fock+bcs model",

    "this contribution is devoted to a systematic investigation on the chain of even - even @xmath0 isotopes and @xmath1 isotones within the self - consistent constraint skyrme - hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( skyrme - hfb ) mean - field theory at the region of large oblate deformations .",
