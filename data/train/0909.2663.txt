    "it became increasingly evident that electronic mobility in graphene is extremely large exceeding that in best semiconductor 2d samples @xcite .",
    "since the system is so clean the transport becomes ballistic , especially in suspended graphene samples @xcite , so that interactions of electrons with phonons , ripplons , disorder and among themselves can be neglected .",
    "therefore there is a chance to observe various theoretically predicted exotic phenomena like nonlinear response and bloch oscillations @xcite .",
    "generally ballistic transport occurs due to two distinct phenomena .",
    "if a mobile charge carrier is available ( as in an electron gas in a metal ) , electric field accelerates it , so that current increases linearly in time .",
    "in addition , an electric field can create new charge carriers ( the process typically suppressed by energy gaps ) .",
    "a peculiarity of the ballistic transport in graphene with the fermi level pinned right on the two dirac points @xcite ( which happens naturally in suspended graphene samples @xcite ) is that there are no charge carriers present at all .",
    "the fermi surface therefore shrinks to just two points .",
    "the carriers are created solely by an applied electric field like in the zener tunneling effect in semiconductors @xcite , but energy gap vanishes due to `` ultra - relativistic '' dispersion relation , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the graphene velocity .",
    "the electron - hole pairs are created fast enough to make the current linear in electric field and constant in time , so that it looks like a drude type linear response due to disorder rather than the ballistic acceleration @xmath8 of an electron gas with finite carrier density .",
    "the illusion of the `` ohmic '' behaviour however can not continue indefinitely in the absence of scatterers , and should eventually cross over to some sort of `` acceleration '' or even bloch oscillations at large times .",
    "the behaviour is expected to become nonlinear as function of electric field as indicated by the nonlinearity of the pair creation rate .",
    "it was shown long time ago @xcite , in the context of particle physics , that the pair creation rate at asymptotically large times is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "ambiguities in the application of the standard kubo approach for the ultra - relativistic spectrum @xcite , led us propose a dynamic approach to the tight binding model of graphene @xcite . within leading order in @xmath0 ( linear response )",
    "we found that the dc conductivity is @xmath10 rather the often cited value @xmath11 obtained both from kubo formula @xcite and within the landauer formalism @xcite . in this note",
    "we solve the tight binding model for arbitrary constant electric field .",
    "the evolution of current density demonstrates that the crossover from the `` ohmic '' regime to the nonlinear one occurs at the experimentally achievable time scale @xmath12 .",
    "bloch oscillations are shown to set in on scale @xmath13 much longer than @xmath2 for experimentally accessible electric fields .",
    "we discuss the relevance of the 2d generalization of the schwinger s creation rate formula @xcite to physics of graphene .",
    "electrons in graphene are described sufficiently well for our purposes by the 2d tight binding model of nearest neighbor interactions on a honeycomb lattice @xcite .",

    "nearest neighbors are separated by distance @xmath17 and pseudospin index denotes two triangular sublattices .",
    "we consider the system in a constant and homogeneous electric field @xmath0 along the @xmath18 direction switched on at @xmath19 .",
    "it is described by the minimal substitution @xmath20 with vector potential @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "since the crucial physical effect of the field is a coherent creation of electron - hole pairs , mostly near the two dirac points , a convenient formalism to describe the pair creation is the `` first quantized '' formulation described in detail in @xcite . to consider the ballistic transport at zero temperature , @xmath23 dynamically , one starts at time @xmath19 from the zero field state in which all the negative energy one - particle states , @xmath24 , are occupied .",
    "the second quantized state evolving from it  is uniquely characterized by the first quantized amplitude , @xmath25 which is a `` spinor '' in the sublattice space .",
    "it obeys the matrix schroedinger equation @xmath26    it is a peculiar property of the tight binding matrix eq.([h ] ) that solution for arbitrary @xmath27 can be reduced to that for @xmath28 and has the fourier series:@xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 for frequency @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "the relevant microscopic time scale is @xmath34 and field @xmath35 .",
    "recursion relations for the fourier amplitudes @xmath36 , @xmath37   p_{m-1}% \\nonumber\\\\ &   -\\frac{\\omega_{m}-2\\omega}{\\omega_{m}-5\\omega}p_{m-2}\\text { , } \\label{rec}%\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] has two solutions @xmath38 , @xmath39 with two floquet frequencies @xcite @xmath40 .",
    "the recursion is easily solved numerically and has the following convergent expansion in @xmath41 in the whole relevant range , @xmath42,@xmath43 \\label{pert}\\\\ &   -\\frac{b^{2}\\left (   \\omega_{0}^{s}-5\\omega\\right )   } { 6\\omega\\left ( \\omega_{0}^{s}-\\omega\\right )   \\left (   \\omega_{0}^{s}-2\\omega\\right )   \\left ( 2\\omega_{0}^{s}-5\\omega\\right )   } + o\\left (   b^{4}\\right )   , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath44 .",
    "it turns out that the two floquet frequencies obey the relation obeying @xmath45 , again peculiar to graphene , as can be checked by both the perturbation theory , eq.([pert ] ) and numerical results . for experimentally accessible cases @xmath46 and the frequencies are just @xmath47 .",
    "coefficients @xmath48 are fixed by initial conditions @xmath49 this solution is used to calculate evolution of current density , energy and the number of electron - hole pairs .",
    "evolution of the current density during the ballistic `` flight time '' @xmath50 is the integral over brillouin zone ( multiplied by factor @xmath51 due to spin ) @xcite : @xmath52 the current density divided by electric field , @xmath53 , is shown in fig.1 and 2 for various values of the dimensionless electric field @xmath54 in the range @xmath55 .",

    "is shown up to ballistic time of @xmath56 demonstrates that after an initial fast increase on the microscopic time scale @xmath57 ( shown in more detail , using linear response , in @xcite ) , @xmath58 approaches the universal value @xmath59 and settles there . beyond linear response one",
    "does not expect the current density to hold up to this value indefinitely . in a ballistic system",
    "the energy initially increases , as follows from the joule law .",
    "the total energy of electrons can be written in the first quantized formalism as @xmath60 it can be shown using eq.([schroedinger ] ) that the power @xmath61 is indeed proportional to current density . since in the tight binding model electron s energy",
    "can not exceed the upper band edge energy @xmath62 , hence at some time scale @xmath63 the energy increase is reversed .",
    "the physics which takes over is that of the bloch oscillations and is similar to that in ordinary materials , namely , electrons energies are elevated by the electric field @xcite due to the quasi - momentum shift .",
    "this feature is not related to the unique `` relativistic '' feature of the graphene spectrum .",
    "[ ptb ]     @xmath57 ]    the current , shown in fig.2 for ballistic times up to @xmath65 , indeed exhibits bloch oscillations .",
    "it turns out that the current vanishes at points given _",
    "exactly _ at multiples of @xmath66 with @xmath67 being the period of the bloch oscillations .",
    "the bloch time is approximately the time required for the electric field to shift the momentum across the brillouin zone @xmath68 .",
    "these times are very long for experimentally achieved fields , much longer than the ballistic flight time .",
    "one observes in fig.2 another peculiar feature that ( apart from the `` relativistic '' initial constant segment ) time dependence of @xmath69 is similar for different electric fields . indeed ,",
    "if one plots @xmath70 versus @xmath71 , all the curves nearly coincide .",
    "moreover @xmath72 is an excellent fit .    for a sample of submicron dimensions , @xmath73 , @xmath74 , the ballistic time",
    "can be estimated as @xmath75 with @xmath76 . for current as large as",
    "the electric field is @xmath78corresponding to @xmath79 ( voltage in such case would be quite large @xmath80 ) .",
    "the first maximum of the bloch oscillation will be seen at flight time of @xmath81 , which is of the same order as @xmath50 .",
    "if one uses a value of the current typical to transport measurements @xmath82 , the electric field is just @xmath83corresponding @xmath84 , @xmath85 and is therefore out of reach .",
    "in fig.1 one clearly observes a remarkable feature : there is a much smaller crossover time @xmath2 , after which the conductivity rises linearly with time above the constant `` universal '' value @xmath59 : @xmath86 the crossover time is @xmath87 it becomes the same as the ballistic time @xmath88 , mentioned above , for relatively weak fields @xmath89 corresponding to @xmath90 .",
    "therefore some of the transport measurements performed might be influenced by the physics beyond linear response .",
    "a qualitative picture of this resistivity without dissipation is as follows .",
    "the electric field creates electron - hole excitations mostly in the vicinity of the dirac points in which electrons behave as massless relativistic fermions with the graphene velocity @xmath91 playing a role of velocity of light . for such particles the absolute value of the velocity is @xmath91 and",
    "can not be altered by the electric field and is not related to the wave vector @xmath92**. * * on the other hand , the orientation of the velocity is influenced by the applied field . * *  * * the electric current is @xmath93 , thus depending on orientation , so that its projection on the field direction @xmath18 is increased by the field .",
    "the energy of the system ( calculated in a way similar to the current ) is increasing continuously if no channel for dissipation is included .",
    "therefore the `` ohmic '' conductivity originates in creation of pairs near the dirac points with an additional contribution due to the alignment of the particles motion with the field s direction . at times of order @xmath63",
    "his process exhausts itself due to the following processes .",
    "electrons gain momentum from the electric field and leave eventually the neighborhoods of the dirac points .",
    "they are no longer ultra - relativistic and are described by ( positive or negative ) effective mass @xcite and the more customary physics takes over .",
    "the crossover to the nonlinear regime can be detected from within the perturbation theory in electric field .",
    "indeed we found that the @xmath94 correction to conductivity is @xmath95   .",
    "\\label{j_correction}%\\ ] ] the correction therefore becomes as large as the leading order for @xmath96 . to gain more insight into the nature of the crossover to nonlinear response we calculated also evolution of the energy and number of electron - hole pairs during the ballistic flight",
    "the states in the conduction band for each momentum @xmath92 in the brillouin zone are described by a pseudospinor@xmath97 orthogonal to @xmath98 defined in eq.([initial ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of lifting of an electron into the conduction band is @xmath99 and consequently the density of pairs ( factor @xmath51 for spin ) reads , @xmath100 and the rate @xmath101 is shown in fig.1 as function of time .",
    "its time dependence exhibits several time scales . at times smaller than @xmath2 expansion in electric field is applicable and",

    "the pair creation rate per unit area rises linearly ( with logarithmic corrections ) , @xmath105 and is dominated by the neighborhood of the dirac points .",
    "however it is clear from fig.1 that the expansion breaks down at @xmath2 , when the rate stabilizes approximately at @xmath106 and scales as the power @xmath9 .",
    "the rate continues to rise in a series of small jumps till bloch oscillations set in . at that stage",
    "( actually at about @xmath107 ) number of electrons elevated into the conduction band becomes of order one , consistent with eq.([t_bloch ] ) .",
    "then it oscillates .",
    "the power @xmath9 is , up to a constant , the same as the rate of the vacuum breakdown due to the pair production calculated beyond perturbation theory by schwinger in the context of particle physics ( when generalized to the 2 + 1 dimensions and zero fermion mass @xcite ) .",
    "this is not surprising since the power @xmath9 is dictated by dimensionality assuming ultra - relativistic approximation is valid .",
    "however the physical meaning is somewhat different .",
    "we have used here a definition of the pairs number with respect to fermi level of the system before the electric field is switched on ( equivalently when an electrons are injected into a graphene sheet from a lead ) .",
    "this is different not only from the schwinger s path integral definition in which the fermi level is `` updated '' along the work of electric field and from the definition proposed recently @xcite in connection with graphene .",
    "the asymptotics at very large times is not relevant for experimentally achievable ballistic times , so that the predicted relatively short plateau segments are more important .",
    "ballistic transport in single graphene sheet near dirac point was investigated using the dynamic approach beyond linear response theory .",
    "we found that , while the observation of the bloch oscillations is difficult , there exists a novel time scale @xmath2 , see eq.([t_cros ] ) , of transition to a nonlinear regime which is within reach of current experimental techniques .",
    "the physics of the ballistic transport in graphene can be described as a succession of four time segments with different character .",
    "\\(ii ) the current density at zero temperature stays constant @xmath109 for ballistic times @xmath110 @xmath2 and physics is partially universal in the following sense .",
    "there are generally two contributions to the current .",
    "while one contribution is dominated by dirac points , the other is related to the band structure .",
    "however the second contribution vanishes due to symmetry properties of the brillouin zone , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) for @xmath111 @xmath63 the current density during the flight would rise above this value .",
    "it is dominated solely by the close vicinity of each of the two dirac points .",
    "perhaps the increase of conductivity might be at least partly responsible for the `` missing @xmath112 '' problem @xcite , namely that experimentally measured minimal conductivity is higher than @xmath59 even in suspended samples @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that in addition to limitations of the tight binding model used which ignores impurities , interactions , deviation of the chemical potential from the dirac point and temperature beyond linear response such `` relativistic '' effects like the pair annihilation neglected . for very large electric fields",
    "the effects of radiation of energy into space ( radiative friction ) might in principle be observable and should be investigated . on the other hand influence of temperature and nonzero chemical potential in nonlinear regime",
