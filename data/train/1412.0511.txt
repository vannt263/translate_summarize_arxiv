    "for a semisimple lie group @xmath0 over @xmath1 , the cotangent bundle of the flag variety @xmath4 and its relation to the braid group have led to numerous active research directions in geometric representation theory , algebraic geometry and symplectic topology . the main driving force for these is due to the fruitful structures underlying the springer resolutions and the adjoint quotient maps .",
    "this paper is an attempt to study the homotopy type of the symplectomorphism group of @xmath4 and its relation to the braid group , from a purely geometric point of view .",
    "we especially focus on the case of @xmath2 .",
    "the motivation is from the ( strong ) categorical braid group action on @xmath5 , the derived category of constructible sheaves on @xmath6 , by deligne @xcite and rouquier@xcite .",
    "this action gives rise to @xmath0-equivariant automorphisms of @xmath5 .",
    "one can translate the result to symplectic geometry via the nadler - zaslow correspondence@xcite . recall that the nadler - zaslow correspondence gives a categorical equivalence between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the derived fukaya category of @xmath9 , for any compact analytic manifold @xmath10 ( see section [ motiv ] for more details ) .",
    "since symplectomorphisms of @xmath4 with reasonable behavior near infinity induce automorphisms of @xmath11 , it is natural to form the following conjecture .",
    "[ conj1 ] the  @xmath0-equivariant \" symplectomorphism group of @xmath4 is homotopy equivalent to the braid group .    to rigorously state the conjecture , one has to give a definition of  @xmath0-equivariancy \" on symplectomorphisms",
    "the global @xmath12-equivariancy condition on a symplectomorphism would force it to be the identity .",
    "the reason is the following .",
    "the springer resolution ( see ( [ springer ] ) for the definition ) @xmath13 gives a @xmath0-equivariant isomorphism from the dense @xmath0-orbit in @xmath4 to @xmath14 , the orbit of regular nilpotent elements in @xmath15 .",
    "suppose @xmath16 is a @xmath0-equivariant symplectomorphism , then the graph of @xmath17 is a complex lagrangian submanifold in @xmath18 , hence the graph of @xmath16 is a closed complex lagrangian .",
    "therefore , @xmath16 preserves the holomorphic symplectic form and then preserves @xmath19 ( see lemma [ inv_moment ] ) , so we can conclude that @xmath20 .",
    "a natural replacement of the global @xmath0-equivariancy condition is to require @xmath16 to be _",
    "@xmath0-equivariant at infinity_. it can be formulated via the lagrangian correspondence @xmath21 , i.e. the graph of @xmath16 , in @xmath22 and its relation to the steinberg variety @xmath23 .",
    "recall that the steinberg variety @xmath23 is the union of the conormal varieties to the @xmath0-orbits in @xmath24 under the diagonal action . using the @xmath25-action on @xmath26 , one can projectivize the cotangent bundle and get a compact symplectic manifold with a contact boundary .",
    "we denote the boundary by @xmath27 , and for any lagrangian @xmath28 in the cotangent bundle , we use @xmath29 to denote for @xmath30 .",
    "then we make the following definition ( see section [ g_sympl ] for more discussions ) .",
    "a symplectomorphism @xmath16 of @xmath4 is _",
    "@xmath0-equivariant at infinity _",
    "if @xmath31 .",
    "we denote by @xmath32 for the group of symplectomorphisms that are @xmath0-equivariant at infinity .",
    "we are content with this definition since the steinberg variety is one of the key players in geometric representation theory , and this definition builds a natural bridge between geometric representation theory and symplectic geometry .",
    "for example , if @xmath33 , then the symplectomorphisms that we are considering are the compactly supported ones . for general @xmath0",
    ", @xmath16 has to preserve the springer fibers , i.e. fibers of @xmath19 , at infinity .",
    "if we fix a maximal compact subgroup @xmath34 in @xmath0 ( e.g. @xmath35 inside @xmath36 and identify @xmath6 with @xmath37 ) , then we can consider the subgroup @xmath38 of ( genuine ) @xmath34-equivariant symplectomorphisms .",
    "we make the following conjecture .",
    "[ conjg ] there is a sequence of homotopy equivalences @xmath39    our main results provide evidence for this conjecture",
    ".      [ intr_thm1 ] ( 1 ) there is a natural surjective group homomorphism @xmath40 + ( 2 ) @xmath41 is a homotopy equivalence for @xmath42 .",
    "the construction of @xmath41 is purely geometric as apposed to the alternative categorical construction ( see remark [ cat_braid ] below ) . as mentioned before",
    ", every @xmath43 must preserve each reduced space of the hamiltonian @xmath34-action .",
    "so the problem of studying the ( weak ) homotopy type of @xmath44 can be roughly reduced to the study of homotopy classes ( and homotopy between homotopies and so on ) of the symplectomorphisms on the hamiltonian reductions over a weyl chamber @xmath45 in the dual of the cartan subalgebra @xmath46 , with some further restrictions at infinity .",
    "for @xmath47 , the reduced space over each element @xmath48 is a point .",
    "however , we have to divide them into two cases .",
    "if @xmath49 , then @xmath50 is an orbit of the @xmath51-action , so @xmath52 is a rotation and corresponds to an element in @xmath53 . if @xmath54 , then the restriction of @xmath16 on @xmath55 is a @xmath34-equivariant automorphism of @xmath37 .",
    "since @xmath56 , @xmath57 corresponds to an element in @xmath58 .",
    "note that the circles over the interior of @xmath45 approach the zero section to a big circle , we see that @xmath16 corresponds to a path in @xmath53 starting from @xmath59 and ending at @xmath60 , and that @xmath16 is a ( iterated ) dehn twist .",
    "it is then easy to see that @xmath38 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath61 , which is weakly homotopy equivalent to @xmath62 , by the result of seidel@xcite .    for @xmath63 , things are more interesting and we will not have all @xmath16 being compactly supported .",
    "the picture in the case of @xmath64 is very illustrating .",
    "let @xmath65 be the moment map . along the ray generated by @xmath66 ,",
    "the reduced spaces are all @xmath67 with three distinguished points corresponding to the singular loci of @xmath68 .",
    "there are exactly two types springer fibers contained in @xmath50 : one is the springer fiber over a regular nilpotent element ( a @xmath69-nilpotent matrix having one single jordan block in its jordan normal form ) , which is just a point ; the other is the springer fiber over a subregular nilpotent element ( a @xmath69-nilpotent matrix having two jordan blocks ) , which is the wedge of two @xmath70-spheres .",
    "the union of subregular springer fibers in @xmath50 projects to two line segments connecting the three special points in the reduced space @xmath71 .",
    "now we draw a small disc @xmath72 around these line segments in @xmath73 for each @xmath74 , which forms a @xmath25-invariant family .",
    "let @xmath75 be the induced map on @xmath76 by @xmath16 .",
    "as @xmath77 , @xmath75 tends to fix all the points outside of @xmath72 , hence after a small homotopy near @xmath78 , @xmath79 becomes a symplectomorphism of @xmath72 , which permutes the three marked points and fixes each point on the boundary .",
    "therefore , it gives rise to an element in @xmath80 , the braid group of three strands .",
    "for @xmath81 , we focus on certain region in @xmath82 , where @xmath83 , and use similar argument .",
    "to prove surjectivity of @xmath41 , we explicitly construct fiberwise dehn twists associated to each simple root @xmath84 ( see remark [ relate ] below ) , and we show that their image under @xmath41 generates @xmath85 .",
    "[ cat_braid ] one could compare the map in theorem [ intr_thm1 ] with the composition @xmath86 through the categorical action of @xmath38 . conjecture [ conjg ] implies that this construction gives @xmath41 as well .",
    "the reason is that the lagrangian correspondences for the fiberwise dehn twists in @xmath26 represent exactly the integral kernels for the braid group action on @xmath5 .",
    "for part ( 2 ) of theorem [ intr_thm1 ] , we have seen the proof when @xmath87 . the proof for @xmath64 consists of two steps .",
    "the first step is to construct local symplectic charts for @xmath88 and  trivialize \" each chart by certain reduced spaces .",
    "the main techniques are the duistermaat - heckman theorem on the normal form of a moment map near a regular value ( see @xcite ) , and weinstein s lagrangian tubular neighborhood theorem .",
    "the second step is to carefully choose isotopies for each @xmath16 over the local charts and to construct relevant fibrations with contractible fibers and/or contractible base , so then we deduce a homotopy equivalence between @xmath89 and a certain path space of the loop space of @xmath90 . by some further restrictions and the fact that @xmath90 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath91 ,",
    "we conclude that the space we have finally arrived is contractible .",
    "one of the difficulties along the way is to take special care for the singular loci of the moment map .",
    "[ relate ] this is a remark on some related result by seidel - smith and thomas .",
    "seidel - smith @xcite considered symplectic fibrations that naturally arise in the adjoint quotient maps in lie theory , and constructed link invariants by the symplectic monodromies .",
    "thomas @xcite generalized this picture to cases including @xmath4 as a symplectic fiber , and deduced an inclusion @xmath92 .",
    "it is described in @xcite that the braid group actions are exactly the  family dehn twists \" about the family of isotropic spheres over @xmath93 , which are the image of the left map in the standard correspondence @xmath94 associated to the @xmath95-fibration @xmath96 , for a minimal parabolic subgroup @xmath97 .",
    "this is essentially the same as the fiberwise dehn twists that we consider here , though we identify @xmath4 as a symplectic fiber bundle over @xmath93 using the killing form on @xmath98 ( rather than @xmath99 ) , and we explicitly make the fiberwise dehn twists all @xmath34-equivariant .",

    "a typical restriction is to make the symplectomorphisms compactly supported , which will turn out to be too small ( see the discussion below ) .",

    "fix such an @xmath905 and for all @xmath906 , let @xmath907 we modify @xmath908 to be @xmath123 in @xmath305 by making sufficiently small isotopies between the vector field @xmath909 with the vector field @xmath888 restricted on @xmath910 .",
    "we can make @xmath905 and the small isotopies continuously depend on @xmath693 , thus get a desired deformation retraction . also by lemma [ triv_2 ] and lemma [ sympl(m_p ) ]",
    ", it is easy to see that @xmath900 is contractible , thus @xmath869 is contractible .",
    "let @xmath911 be the space of maps @xmath912 where @xmath913 for @xmath305 close to 0 .",
    "the natural map does nt act on @xmath878 .",

    "@xmath916 defines a fibration of @xmath914 over the image denoted as @xmath917 .",
    "the fiber @xmath918 over the constant identity path is contractible .",
    "in fact , one can use step 2(a ) in the proof of lemma [ sympl(m_p ) ] to deform @xmath918 to a subspace where any @xmath16 satisfies that its restriction to some neighborhood of each @xmath919 is the left action by @xmath920 for some @xmath921 , for all @xmath922 and @xmath923 .",
    "then one uses step 2(b ) in the proof of lemma [ sympl(m_p ) ] and lemma [ triv_2 ] to give a deformation retraction of the resulting space to a point .",
    "this step focuses on @xmath926 .",
    "note that @xmath928 can be viewed as the image of the moment map @xmath929 for the @xmath930-action on @xmath926 .",
    "since @xmath931 is the right multiplication by an element in @xmath569 , @xmath932 corresponds to a loop in @xmath569 . on the other hand ,",
    "given any @xmath123-map @xmath933 with @xmath934 when @xmath305 is close to 0 , and @xmath935 , the following construction gives a _ unique _ @xmath533-equivariant symplectomorphism @xmath936 on @xmath562 , such that @xmath937 .",
    "one starts with the automorphism whose restriction to @xmath938 is @xmath939 , and modifies it to a @xmath533-equivariant symplectomorphism , by applying similar argument as in corollary [ equiv_sympl ] and using the fact that the form @xmath940 here .",
    "now let @xmath941 be the loop defined by @xmath16 , then @xmath942 becomes the identity on @xmath943 .",
    "now by lemma [ w_0 ] , and the fact that @xmath534 has a natural kahler structure , we can run the same argument as in lemma [ id_zero ] to make @xmath942 isotopic to the identity in a neighborhood of @xmath943 . then compose back with @xmath944",
    ", we get a symplectomorphism of @xmath562 , which agrees with @xmath16 near the boundary and is @xmath944 near @xmath945 .",
    "we can homotopically  push \" the region of @xmath944 ( in some fixed pattern ) to contain a fixed conical neighborhood of @xmath943 , say @xmath946 , since outside any neighborhood of @xmath943 , we are in the situation where corollary [ equiv_sympl ] can be applied .",
    "similarly , we can deform @xmath16 over @xmath947 , where @xmath948 is the cone bounded by @xmath949 .    from now on ,",
    "we can restrict ourselves to the space of @xmath950 where @xmath16 restricted to @xmath951 is @xmath944 and it has similar behavior over @xmath947 . for simplicity , we still denote this space by @xmath925 .",
    "let @xmath952 be the based path space of the based loop space @xmath953 , i.e. the space of maps @xmath954 , with @xmath955 being the constant loop @xmath956 .",
    "first , we replace @xmath958 ( resp .",
    "@xmath959 ) by a proper subcone bounded by @xmath518 ( resp .",
    "@xmath519 ) and a ray in @xmath960 ( resp .",
    "@xmath960 ) .",
    "the natural map @xmath961 is surjective .",
    "in fact , once we know its restriction to @xmath606 , any @xmath962 can be constructed and is determined by a @xmath123-map from @xmath963 to @xmath90 and a map from @xmath964 to @xmath90 , subject to the obvious matching conditions , the constraints near @xmath965 and @xmath966 as in step 2 , and that the maps converge to @xmath967 at infinity .",
    "thus , the pair of maps corresponds exactly to a pair of paths in the identity component of the based loop space @xmath968 , with the initial condition given and the end points ( more precisely , a small interval around it ) lying in @xmath969 ( @xmath91 comes from @xmath569 modulo the center ) . since @xmath90 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath91 , we see that @xmath970 is a fibration with contractible fibers .      from the previous steps , we see that @xmath971 is contractible .",
    "now we show that the fiber over @xmath972 for the projection @xmath973 is again contractible . any @xmath16",
    "lying in the kernel corresponds to a path @xmath974 .",
    "however , there are strong constraints on the end points of such paths : @xmath16 induces the identity on the reduced spaces near @xmath928 and @xmath975 , therefore @xmath976 and @xmath977 , and these force @xmath978 to lie in @xmath979 . since @xmath979 is contractible",
    ", we can conclude that the fiber is contractible , thus @xmath925 is contractible ."
