    "tracking the evolution of metals from star - size scale to large - scale structures is a major step in understanding the evolution of the universe .",
    "metals are produced in stellar interiors and then ejected in their environs through supernova ( sn ) explosions and stellar winds , thus enriching the interstellar medium ( ism ) of their galaxy .",
    "so far , the study of metal enrichment in galaxies at high redshifts has been carried out mostly by observing galaxies along the line of sight of bright quasars .",
    "this technique is plagued by selection effects , e.g. radiation from quasars probes more probably halos of the intervening galaxies .",
    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are opening a completely new window in understanding the history of metals and galaxy formation , in particular at high redshift .",
    "this is because , for geometrical reasons , quasar sight lines should preferentially intersect the outer regions of the ism in high@xmath2 galaxies .",
    "in contrast , grbs originate within the densest regions of their host galaxies where massive stars are produced , probing denser environments ( prochaska et al .",
    "it is now recognized that long - duration grbs are linked to collapse of massive stars , based on the association between ( low@xmath2 ) grbs and ( type ic ) core - collapse supernovae ( woosley & bloom 2006 and references therein ) . indeed , at least @xmath3 of grbs with known redshift show intrinsic ( i.e. at the redshift of the host galaxy ) x  ray absorption larger than @xmath4 ( campana et al .",
    "2010 ; see also stratta et al .",
    "2005 ; campana et al .",
    "in particular , more than @xmath5 of grbs show an intrinsic column density larger than @xmath6 cm @xmath7 ( campana et al .",
    "furthermore , the presence of absorption indicates a significant metal enrichment , because x ",
    "rays are effectively photoelectrically absorbed only by metals .",
    "metallicities larger than those derived from damped lyman alpha ( dla ) studies at the same redshift are also measured from optical studies of grb .",
    "they indicate that the metal abundance can be as high as @xmath8 of the solar one up to @xmath9 ( savaglio 2006 ; kawai et al 2006 ; campana et al .",
    "signatures for the presence of this material can be expected in the optical light curve of grb afterglows showing up as flux enhancements in their light curves or as ( variable ) fine - structure transition lines in their spectra ( vreeswijk et al .",
    "2007 ; delia et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ) as well as ly@xmath10 ( thne et al .",
    "the observations of these features can set important constraints on the density and distance of the absorbing material located either in the star - forming region within which the progenitor formed or in the circumstellar environment of the progenitor itself ( prochaska et al .",

    "2009a , 2009b ) .    .xmm - newton observation log . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath11 upper limits are @xmath12 confidence level for one parameter of interest ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "intervals are @xmath12 confidence level for one parameter of interest .",
    "these values were obtained by leaving free the abundances of each element , one by one keeping the other abundances tied together and free to vary .    motivated by this analysis we fit the same spectra leaving free the abundances of ne , s and fe and linking together all the other elements ( mainly driven by oxygen ) .",
    "the fit improves with a @xmath14 with 1258 dof ( @xmath15 ) and @xmath16 nhp .",
    "formally , an f - test gives a random probability for the improvement of @xmath17 , equivalent to a significance of @xmath18 .",
    "the new fit provides a column density of @xmath19 and just an upper limit on the metallicity of the remaining elements of @xmath20 .",
    "the abundances of the three elements left free to vary together lie within @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 , respectively . a contour plot of s and ne abundances is shown in fig .",
    "we also searched for structures due to absorption of different ionization stages and/or to dust around the edges of the above elements at the known grb redshift of @xmath24 , finding none .",
    "given the presence of possible uncertainties in the galactic column density determination , in the adopted solar abundance pattern we left free to vary the galactic column density in a @xmath25 range around the selected value .",
    "we then repeat the fit with a constant metallicity and the fit with ne , s and fe free to vary .",
    "the fit with constant metallicity is characterized by a large galactic column density ( at the edge of the allowed distribution ) and with a @xmath26 ( 1260 dof ) .",
    "the fit with variable ne , s and fe abundances gives a @xmath15 ( 1257 dof ) . in this case",
    "the f - test gives a a random probability for the improvement of @xmath27 , equivalent to a significance of @xmath28 .",
    "we also search for possible emission lines .",
    "we first search for an iron line looking for an unresolved emission line in the 6.46.9 kev ( rest frame ) energy interval .",
    "this range is covered by pn data only .",
    "we do not find any significant line in this range and we are able to put an upper limit ( @xmath12 confidence ) of 37 ev to any line .",
    "we also inspect the rgs data .",
    "one of the strongest ( narrow ) emission lines is oviii at 654 ev ( see , e.g. , bertone et al .",
    "2010 for the list of line searched ) .",
    "we find a hint for the presence of this line at an energy of 432 ev ( 665 ev rest frame ) even if its significance is between @xmath12 and @xmath29 ( see fig .",
    "the line equivalent width is 4.8 ev .",
    "the velocity difference of the line energy with respect to the quoted redshift is on the blue side of the spectrum , possibly indicating an outflow , but amounts to @xmath30 km s@xmath31 , which seems somewhat high .",
    "x  ray observations hold a great potential to probe the environment surrounding grbs thanks to the imprint left by metals on the afterglow spectrum . here",
    "we exploit an xmm - newton observation of the bright grb 090618 discovered by _",
    "the xmm - newton afterglow spectrum is well fit by a power law model absorbed by a ( known ) galactic component and an intrinsic component at the grb redshift ( @xmath24 and metallicity fixed to the solar value shows that there are two solutions one at @xmath32 and another at @xmath33 .",
    "this indicates that xmm - newton data alone , in this case , are not sufficient to uniquely identify the grb redshift . ] ) .    assuming the wilms et al .",
    "( 2000 ) solar abundance patter , we estimate the mean metallicity of the absorbing medium close to the grb .",
    "the metallicity of the medium is strongly covariant with the total amount of the absorbing column ( see fig .",
    "2 ) and we are able to set a lower limit of @xmath34 ( @xmath12 confidence level ) . the collapsar scenario for grbs requires a massive helium star with rapidly rotating core ( woosley 1993 ; macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "low metallicities are requested by models in order to ensure that the rotationally induced mixing process produces a quasi - chemically homogeneous stellar evolution avoiding the spin - down of the stellar core ( izzard , ramirez - riuz & tout 2004 ; yoon & langer 2005 ; woosley & heger 2006 ) .",
    "this metallicity threshold is expected to be around @xmath35 . if the medium probed by our observations has not been heavily enriched by the progenitor and is therefore indicative of the progenitor s metallicity , our result is ( barely ) consistent with model predictions .",
    "given however the low redshift of the grb and the brightness of the host galaxy it can also be expected that the mean metallicity of the medium is high .    analyzing the pn and rgs data we found that the absorbing medium might be overabundant in ne and s ( see fig .",
    "3 and table 3 ) .",
    "both best fit column densities are @xmath36 .",
    "clearly we do not have an idea of the distance of the absorbing medium nor of its geometry .",
    "considering spherical symmetry and a distance scale of 0.1 pc we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 mass of ne and s , respectively , as well as @xmath39 of hydrogen .",
    "this sets the order of magnitude of the distance in the case of a medium enriched by the progenitor .",
    "larger distances naturally involve a pre - existing and pre - enriched medium likely by type ib / ic supernovae ( enrichment by type ii supernova will involve also an o overabundance ) .",
    "an account of the absorption can be obtained by studying the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) from uv to nir .",
    "this is made possible by the detection of grb 090618 by _ swift_/uvot and by several robotic telescopes at early times .",
    "fitting the sed at 600 s one can infer , in addition to the galactic absorption of @xmath40 , an intrinsic absorption of about @xmath41 , using a small magellanic cloud ( smc ) extinction law ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "a fit with a large magellanic cloud or milky way extinction laws provides unsatisfactory fits ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) .",
    "we note that this value is somewhat smaller than the value reported by cano et al .",
    "( 2011 ) at later times of @xmath45 , but consistent within the errors .    for a smc extinction one would expect @xmath46 @xmath47 ( weingartner & draine 2001 ) .",
    "this implies for the solar abundance pattern fit with fixed metallicity of the x  ray spectrum a predicted optical absorption @xmath48 and with free metallicity @xmath49 .",
    "both estimates are in agreement with the observations .",
    "if we consider instead the fit with a peculiar abundance pattern ( i.e. the one with ne , s and fe free ) the intrinsic column density is larger and the predicted @xmath50 is just barely consistent with observations ( see fig .",
    "we note that it is not common that x  ray and optical absorption are in agreement .",
    "finally , we try to put in a context our exploratory study of bright grbs with xmm - newton ( see also campana et al .",
    "2011 ) . in fig .",
    "6 we show the light curves of _ swift _ grbs with a count rate larger than 1,000 c s@xmath31 . excluding those grbs observed during the prompt event also with xrt , because triggered on a precursor event , we have 17 events . at the time of the xmm - newton observation grb 090618",
    "is one of the brightest indicating that to improve on the results obtained in this letter we would need : @xmath51 ) larger intrinsic column densities ( in order to have larger absorption signatures ) .",
    "this burst has an intrinsic column density of @xmath52 , placing it in the tail of the column density distribution ( campana et al .",
    "2010 ) , @xmath53 ) longer exposure times ( in order to collect more photons , extending by another 25 ks the observation would have added about @xmath54 more photons ) , @xmath55 ) faster response ( in order to collect more photons , being on target 1 hr before would increase the total number of collected photons by @xmath56 ) , and @xmath57 ) lower particle background ( in order to throw away less exposure time and in turn get more photons ) . along these lines",
    "xmm - newton studies of the ambient medium surrounding grbs is promising .",
