    "recently , the higgs boson has been discovered at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the higgs mass is revealed around 125  gev and the nature seems to be consistent with the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the magnitude of the higgs quartic coupling @xmath5 is @xmath6 .",
    "it then turns out that the perturbation works up to very high energy scale , although @xmath5 becomes negative at some scale  @xcite .",
    "recall that the color and weak gauge interactions are asymptotic free within the sm .",
    "the sm top - yukawa coupling @xmath7 is also decreasing function with respect to the energy scale @xmath8 .",
    "the hypercharge gauge coupling @xmath9 is increasing , but it stays perturbative up to the planck scale @xmath10 .",
    "therefore it seems that there is no room for strongly interacting theories in high energy .    on the other hand ,",
    "the gravity is apparently strong around the planck scale .",
    "if the complicated yukawa structure of the sm is dynamically generated as in low energy qcd , we may expect some strong dynamics in a high energy scale  @xcite .",
    "is there a remnant of such a strong interaction ?",
    "nonzero neutrino mass is one of the evidences of physics beyond the sm .",
    "considering the quark ",
    "lepton correspondence  @xcite , the existence of the right - handed neutrinos is highly possible .",
    "the see - saw mechanism might help to generate tiny neutrino masses  @xcite .",
    "since the majorana mass term explicitly breaks the lepton number , we may introduce an extra complex scalar field and a majorana yukawa coupling between the scalar and the right - handed neutrino . a simple extension of the sm including the above is the @xmath11 model  @xcite .",
    "the right - handed neutrino is now _ inevitably _ required in order to cancel the anomaly of the @xmath3 gauge current .    in this paper , we explore the possibility of a composite @xmath0 .",
    "note that we do not need so strong @xmath12 gauge coupling , if the strong coupling region is around the planck or the gut scale .",
    "the landau pole @xmath13 of the @xmath12 gauge interaction is expressed as @xmath14 , where @xmath1 and @xmath15 denote the @xmath12 gauge coupling and the coefficient of the renormalization group equation ( rge ) for @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "the typical mass scale of the @xmath12 gauge boson is @xmath16 . in the case of @xmath17 ,",
    "the landau pole is well above the planck scale , @xmath18 gev by taking @xmath19  gev , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "this is the reason why the @xmath17 gauge interaction stays perturbative .",
    "however , in order to obtain @xmath22 , we just need @xmath2 for the @xmath3 model , where @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "this lower bound is about half of the weak coupling square , @xmath24 .",
    "of course , bigger @xmath3 gauge coupling implies an exponentially smaller scale of the landau pole . in any case , if @xmath2 for the @xmath3 model is established in experiments , this suggests the existence of the strong interaction in high energy .",
    "if so , we may expect that the @xmath0 boson associated with the @xmath3 model is composite .",
    "( for the earlier approach , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "first , we show that the strong gauge coupling limit of the stckelberg model  @xcite corresponds to the nambu - jona - lasinio ( njl ) model with the vectorial four - fermion interaction .",
    "next , we argue that the stckelberg model is effectively induced in low energy via the bubble diagram . for the conceptual diagrams ,",
    "see figs .",
    "[ prop - s ] and [ prop - g ] .",
    "the compositeness at the scale @xmath13 can be described by the compositeness conditions , @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the majorana yukawa interaction and the quartic coupling of the extra complex scalar field , respectively , as in the bardeen , hill and lindner ( bhl ) approach  @xcite of the top condensate model  @xcite .",
    "( see also the earlier attempt  @xcite . )",
    "the behavior of @xmath28 is controlled by the pendleton ",
    "ross type infrared fixed point ( pr - irfp )  @xcite .",
    "also , we find that @xmath29 is determined by an infrared fixed point . in our approach ,",
    "the ratio of the masses of the extra scalar @xmath30 and the right - handed neutrino @xmath31 is fixed to @xmath32 . in sharp contrast to the conventional @xmath3 model",
    ", the @xmath0 mass has the contribution of the stckelberg mass term , so that @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "this nonzero @xmath4 might be the remnant of the strong dynamics in high energy .",
    "although we study only a fine - tuning scenario with a light composite @xmath0 in this paper , it might be more natural that the masses of @xmath0 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are around the compositeness scale @xmath13 . in the latter case",
    ", we will use the see - saw mechanism  @xcite .",
    "we here mention that the higgs potential can be stabilized owing to the tree level threshold corrections for the higgs quartic coupling , which is generated by the @xmath0 loop effect  @xcite .",
    "we will investigate such a possibility elsewhere .",
    "let us first revisit the stckelberg formalism for the massive photon  @xcite .",
    "introducing the stckelberg scalar field @xmath35 , the lagrangian density of a massive vector field @xmath36 is @xmath37 with @xmath38 @xmath39 and @xmath40 where @xmath41 is a four - component fermion , @xmath42 denotes the field strength , @xmath43 and we represented the mass of the vector field @xmath36 by a gauge coupling constant @xmath1 times a parameter @xmath44 having mass - dimension one . although @xmath41 may have a dirac mass , it is irrelevant in the following discussions .",
    "the parts of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are invariant under the ( infinitesimal ) local @xmath12 transformation , @xmath47 unlike the proca field , this system is power - counting renormalizable .",
    "we also note that we can rewrite the gauge fixing term by using the becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin ( brst ) construction .",
    "has a positive metric , in sharp contrast to the nakanishi - lautrup field , which is introduced in a general brst invariant construction of the gauge fixing term . ]",
    "we may normalize @xmath36 and @xmath35 as @xmath48 and @xmath49 , and then we read the gauge sector , @xmath50 also the gauge fixing term becomes @xmath51 formally , taking the limit of @xmath52 , we obtain @xmath53 where we dropped the total derivative term .",
    "the stckelberg fields @xmath36 and @xmath35 are now the auxiliary ones and thus , by performing the gauss integral , we find @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "that is the njl model with the vectorial four - fermion interaction is equivalent to the strong coupling limit of the stckelberg model .",
    "we now start from a model with a majorana - type scalar four - fermion coupling and a vector one : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a two - component fermion , for example , a right - handed neutrino , and @xmath59 is the charge conjugation .",
    "this system classically has a global @xmath12 symmetry , @xmath60 by introducing auxiliary fields , @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 , we can rewrite the model as follows : @xmath64 with @xmath65 and @xmath66 .    in low energy , the composite scalar and vector fields acquire the kinetic terms via the bubble diagrams , model discussed later , there are many fermions : three @xmath31 s contribute to both figs .",
    "[ prop - s ] and [ prop - g ] , and also the sm fermions contribute to fig .",
    "[ prop - g ] , because they have the @xmath11 charges .",
    "thus the @xmath67-approximation is applicable . ]",
    "similar to the top condensate model  la bhl  @xcite .",
    "see also figs .",
    "[ prop - s ] and [ prop - g ] .",
    "the calculation for the vector - vector correlator is rather tricky , however . as is well - known",
    ", a sharp cutoff regularization , which is usually used in the calculation of the two point function of the scalar sector , is not appropriate .",
    "instead , we employ the proper time regularization .",
    "the vacuum polarization diagram then yields @xmath68 where we introduced the cutoff @xmath69 in the infrared part of the proper time integral .",
    "thus the induced effective theory in a low energy scale @xmath8 is @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and the scalar quartic coupling @xmath73 is induced by the bubble diagram .",
    "the wave function renormalization constants are @xmath74 let us introduce @xmath75 and rescale @xmath36 and @xmath76 as @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the effective theory thereby has the canonical kinetic terms , @xmath79 we further carry out field - dependent rotations for the fermion and scalar variables , @xmath80 and @xmath81 also redefine the gauge field @xmath82 . because we introduced a redundant field @xmath83 , we should add a delta function @xmath84 with @xmath85 in the path integral . although the fermion path integral measure yields anomaly from these rotations , this is because we considered a simple model just for a schematic explanation . in the next section",
    ", we study an anomaly - free theory .",
    "any vectorial four - fermion couplings consistent with the symmetry would be possible at the compositeness scale @xmath13 , but , only the anomaly - free combinations among the composite gauge interactions should be left in low energy .    in any case , the theory is then @xmath86 which is essentially equivalent to the stckelberg model with the complex scalar field .",
    "the gauge fixing term comes from the delta function @xmath84 added in the partition function . in the njl picture , we can not avoid quadratically fine - tuning in order to obtain wanted values of the mass terms for the composite scalar and vector fields in ( [ leff ] ) from ( [ njl - maj ] ) .    in summary",
    ", we introduced the redundant field @xmath83 , which corresponds to the stckelberg scalar field , and thereby the global @xmath12 symmetry is upgraded to the local one , @xmath87 in the hidden local symmetry approach for the chiral symmetry breaking , the polar decomposition of the complex scalar field is used  @xcite .",
    "the hidden symmetry is essentially connected with the ambiguity of the polar decomposition .",
    "if we apply the same manner in the above model , the @xmath12 symmetry is _ explicitly _ broken down owing to the majorana - type interaction . in our approach ,",
    "when the @xmath30 field develops a nonzero vacuum expectation value ( vev ) in some low energy scale , the local @xmath12 symmetry is _ spontaneously _ broken down . in this case , the gauge field acquires the mass from both the nonzero vev of @xmath30 and the stckelberg mass term built in the model from the very beginning .",
    "furthermore , it turns out that the stckelberg model as a low energy effective theory corresponds to the composite model in a high energy scale @xmath13 , when we impose the compositeness conditions , @xmath88    in the next section , we apply this formulation to a realistic @xmath0 model .",
    "let us study the @xmath3 extension of the sm .",
    "the lagrangian density is @xmath89 where @xmath90 represents the sm part , and @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 the field @xmath94 and @xmath95 denote the sm higgs doublet and the gauge fixing term , respectively .",
    "the @xmath12 part of the covariant derivative is @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 denote the hypercharge and the @xmath11 charge , respectively .",
    "the gauge couplings of @xmath17 and @xmath3 are @xmath9 and @xmath1 , respectively . in general , the gauge mixing coupling @xmath99 appears .",
    "it is natural to set @xmath100 , because of no gauge kinetic mixing term at the compositeness scale @xmath13 . as for the scalar quartic mixing @xmath101",
    ", the operator @xmath102 has a higher dimension than six at the compositeness scale @xmath13 .",
    "thus we may safely neglect it , i.e. , @xmath103 .    unlike the conventional @xmath0 model , the stckelberg mass term",
    "is incorporated in this composite model as in eq .",
    "( [ zp ] ) .",
    "this is essential in our formalism of the composite vector field .",
    "the full set of the rge s for the @xmath3 model is shown in refs .",
    "essentially , the rge s for the gauge and yukawa couplings are @xmath104 , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we took @xmath105 .",
    "the coefficients of the rge s are @xmath23 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 .",
    "we may take the number of the right - handed neutrinos having relevant majorana yukawa couplings to @xmath108 in general , and then the coefficient @xmath109 is @xmath110 . for details ,",
    "see refs.@xcite .",
    "we fix @xmath111 hereafter . imposing the compositeness conditions , @xmath112",
    ", we analytically find the solutions , @xmath113 where @xmath13 is the compositeness scale .",
    "this solution corresponds to the pr - irfp  @xcite , is used in ref .",
    "thus the situation @xmath114 occurs in low energy unlike in the asymptotic nonfree theory . ] . actually , we can easily rewrite the rge s as follows : @xmath115 and hence the solution ( [ prfp ] ) is the pr - irfp . owing to this nature of the pr - irfp ,",
    "if we relax the compositeness conditions to @xmath116 ( nonvanishing ) , the rg flows are not changed so much .",

    "the square of the masses of @xmath31 , @xmath30 and @xmath0 are @xmath138 the irfp solutions yield the mass relation between @xmath31 and @xmath30 , @xmath139 in sharp contrast to the conventional approach for @xmath0 , we have the contribution of the stckelberg mass to @xmath140 , @xmath141 if the experiments such as lhc and ilc observe @xmath142 and confirm @xmath2 , it implies the compositeness of @xmath0 .",
    "we studied the composite @xmath0 vector boson .",
    "we found that the strong coupling limit of the stckelberg model corresponds to the njl model and that the stckelberg model is effectively induced in low energy via the fermion loop from the njl model .",

    "we showed that the rg flows are determined by the irfp .",
    "the nature of the irfp yields the mass ratio , @xmath143 .",
    "the @xmath0 mass is composed of the vev of @xmath30 and the stckelberg mass .",
    "owing to this extra mass term , the constraints of the @xmath0 model from the precision measurements , the bounds of the direct searches at tevatron , lhc , etc.@xcite should be relaxed .",
    "if @xmath33 is established in experiments  @xcite , this might be evidence of the strong dynamics in high energy .",
    "we here considered a scenario that the composite @xmath0 boson survives in low energy . from the viewpoint of the naturalness",
    ", however , the masses of @xmath0 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 might not be so far below the compositeness scale @xmath13 . in this case , the see - saw mechanism may work .",
    "we also note that the higgs potential can be stabilized by the tree level shift of the higgs quartic coupling essentially generated by the @xmath0 loop contribution  @xcite .",
    "our approach is unlikely to be applicable to the stckelberg extension of the sm  @xcite , because the weak and hypercharge gauge couplings are perturbative up to the planck scale .",
