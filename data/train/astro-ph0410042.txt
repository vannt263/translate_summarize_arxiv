    "recently , we have found several sdbs that show a very large enrichment of iron group elements ( edelmann et al .",
    "three out of thirteen targets showed abundances of these elements of up to 10@xmath1 times the solar value .",
    "around 23% of the lines in the peculiar sdbs remain unidentified .",
    "these metal - enriched sdbs are reminiscent of the chemically peculiar a stars , where strong magnetic fields play a major role in the surface abundance patterns .",
    "although no direct evidence for magnetic fields was found , we felt a proper examination of these peculiar objects for such a field was clearly required .",
    "strittmatter & norris ( 1971 ) studied the role of magnetic fields in chemically peculiar a stars , and several of their conclusions may be relevant to sdbs .",
    "the abundance pecularities in ap stars are , in general , confined to the stellar surface .",
    "if the magnetic field is strong enough , strittmatter & norris suggest that magnetic braking will occur , causing angular momentum loss and resulting in a slowly rotating star .",
    "the slowing of the star s rotation can lead to peculiar surface abundances , however there is no well established or detailed theory . in the case of sdb stars ,",
    "the vast majority are slowly rotating , with observational limits of @xmath2kms@xmath3 .",
    "the only sdb star for which rotation has been detected is pg1605 + 072 ( heber et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the metal lines of all the stars studied by edelmann et al .",
    "( 2001 ) are very sharp , consistent with projected rotational velocities of @xmath4kms@xmath3 .",
    "could the slow rotation of sdb stars , coupled with a magnetic field of 1 - 2 kg , be the cause of the peculiar abundance patterns of some sdb and sdob stars ? to test this idea , we used the eso / vlt equipped with fors1 to investigate circular polarisation in hot subdwarfs with peculiar surface abundances .",
    "we have also observed apparently `` normal '' sdb and sdo stars for comparison .",
    "elkin ( 1996 ) conducted a search for magnetic fields in sdb and sdo stars using the 6 m special astrophysical observatory , however , his study used several different measurement techniques and was therefore quite inhomogeneous .",
    "our study is the first homogeneous search for magnetic fields in sdb stars .",
    "elkin ( 1996 ) reported the detection of fields in two targets , the sdo star bd@xmath5 and the sdob star feige66 .",
    "the other results were presented in elkin ( 1998 ) and were largely inconclusive , with errors for some targets approaching @xmath61 kg .",
    "we do not believe this is sufficient for sdb stars , since , based on elkin s detection of a variable field in the sdob star feige 66 with extrema of @xmath71.3 kg and + 1.75 kg , we expect field strengths to be no larger than @xmath81 - 2 kg . by measuring the polarisation of the balmer lines using the method of bagnulo et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , we expected our typical error for each target would be 200 - 300 g.",
    "our observations were made with fors1 at the vlt using the spectropolarimetry setup discussed by bagnulo et al .",
    "briefly , a wollaston prism and a quarter - wave retarder plate were placed in the beam .",
    "we used the 600b grism which allowed spectropolarimetry of the balmer sequence from h@xmath9 to the balmer discontinuity , as well as several strong helium lines .",
    "exposures were taken using two orientations of the retarder plate separated by 90@xmath10 to cancel out instrumental polarisation .",
    "both of our super metal - rich stars were observed , along with a `` normal '' sdb , an evolved , post - ehb sdb , and two helium - rich sdos .",
    "feige 66 , the sdob star with a previously measured magnetic field , was not observable due to weather constraints .",
    "previous studies of circularly polarised stellar spectra have focussed solely on the balmer lines ( e.g. bagnulo et al . 2002 ; aznar - cuadrado et al .",
    "2004 ) , because they are strong in ap stars and da white dwarfs .",
    "this is true of many hot subdwarfs , but often helium lines are also present , and in some cases hydrogen is extremely deficient . in order to realise the full potential of our spectra , we calculated lande @xmath11-factors for the strongest hei and heii lines .",
    "the values for the two strongest lines are hei 4471 : 1.17 ; and heii 4686 : 1.07 .",
    "note that for all balmer lines the lande g - factor is approximately unity . comparing our measured stokes _",
    "v / i _ profiles with those expected based on the weak - field approximation , we were able to measure the magnetic field of each of our targets .",
    "as in aznar cuadrado et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we used @xmath12 fits of the polarisation pattern in the vicinity of strong lines in order to derive mean longitudinal magnetic fields and their respective error margins . observed profiles of three of our targets are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pg0909 ] and [ fig : lse153 ] , along with our best fit .    using this method ,",
    "we have made clear detections in five of six targets : uvo0512@xmath708 , pg0909 + 276 , hd76431 , lse153 and cpd@xmath13 , with measured field strengths of @xmath14 g , @xmath15 g , @xmath16 g , @xmath17 g and @xmath18 g , respectively .",
    "these values are weighted averages of several lines , the number of strong , usable lines depending on the helium abundance of the star .",
    "the sixth star in our sample , cd@xmath19 , shows a possibly significant field strength , however , most lines in its spectrum are blended .",
    "since there is no clear difference between the field strengths of the `` normal '' and super metal - rich stars in our sample , it is unlikely that magnetic fields are directly connected to large abundance peculiarities in hot subdwarfs .",
    "the origin of the fields detected here are unknown , and the fields are found in objects from various evolutionary channels . while the two sdobs and two sdbs have probably followed similar evolutionary channels , the same can not be said for at least one of the sdo stars .",
    "lse153 can be associated with the `` born - again '' post - agb scenario , while the helium - rich sdo , cd@xmath20 , may not be related to the hydrogen rich sdb and sdob stars .",
    "if we assume that all of these objects will evolve into white dwarfs , then we can estimate what the field strength will be if the magnetic flux is completely conserved .",
    "the radii of the sdb / ob stars are 0.15 - 0.25@xmath21 ( taking the canonical mass of an ehb star to be 0.48@xmath22 ) .",
    "since they will evolve directly into white dwarfs , their radii will shrink by a factor of @xmath820 , leading to field strengths of up to 500 kg , values which are apparently rarely seen .",
    "the search for rotation in white dwarfs ( heber et al .",
    "1997 ; koester et al .  1998",
    "; karl et al .  2004 ) from high resolution h@xmath23 spectroscopy also resulted in constraints on field strengths . amongst the @xmath850 da",
    "white dwarfs studied , only four turned out to be magnetic with @xmath24 up to 180 kg , while upper limits of 10 - 20 kg could be derived for the rest .",
    "the detection of significant polarisation in our sample of hot subdwarfs suggests that magnetic field strengths of @xmath81 - 2 kg are actually quite common among these stars .",
    "it remains to be seen whether or not hot subdwarfs all have such fields , or if for some reason our study simply `` got lucky '' . with this in mind",
    ", we plan to survey magnetic fields in a larger number of targets .",
