    "the einstein - maxwell field equations play a significant role in several different applications in relativistic astrophysics .",
    "the study of @xcite showed that the electric field is essential in describing the equilibrium of compact bodies , and charge may even halt gravitational collapse .",
    "the necessary requirement in relativistic astrophysics is to build stable equilibrium solutions of the einstein - maxwell system , and to generate models of different astrophysical objects with strong gravitational fields by choosing appropriate matter distributions .",
    "models built in this way maybe useful in describing the physical characteristics of compact stellar objects such as gravastars , neutron stars , quark stars , etc .",
    "@xcite has observed that all macroscopic bodies are charge neutral or they may possess a small amount of charge , so that the structure of the stellar body is not much affected in the latter stages of its evolution . nevertheless , note that there are early phases in the evolution of a compact star , in which immediate charge neutrality is not possible , but it is attained in later stages .",
    "this situation arises , for example , at the birth of a compact star from the core collapse supernova . in this case",
    "the electromagnetic field substantially affects the structure of the star .",
    "a large charge distribution can disrupt the structure of the stellar body .",
    "@xcite showed from the balance of forces and the strength of their coupling , that such huge charge disrupting the stellar structure , has very little effect in the equation of state of the content . taking the protons as the carrier of the charge in the stellar body",
    ", they demonstrated that one extra proton in a sea of @xmath0 baryons , can generate a total charge that will modify the stars structure .",
    "it is important to point out , that there has been considerable recent improvements in observations relating to compact stellar bodies .",
    "the mass of many compact stellar bodies have been found with a fair degree of precision ; the main challenge is to accurately determine the radius of the star .",
    "some recent studies have developed improved techniques which give the accurate mass and the radius of some compact stellar objects .",
    "this improved observational information about such compact objects has generated much interest about the internal matter content and consequently the spacetime geometry .",
    "solutions of the einstein - maxwell system with an equation of state are desirable in the description of realistic astrophysical objects",
    ". the importance of an equation of state in a stellar model has been comprehensively investigated by @xcite .",
    "studies in quark stars involve physics at high densities described by a linear equation of state .",
    "various aspects of the phenomenological mit bag model with linear quark equation of state have been considered by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "there have been some attempts made recently to find exact analytic solutions of the einstein - maxwell system for bound matter configurations with a linear equation of state .",
    "these include the treatments of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , mafa takisa and maharaj ( 2013 ) and @xcite .",
    "models with a quadratic equation of state are rare because of the increased nonlinearity in the field equations .",
    "the models of @xcite and @xcite are recent examples that satisfy a quadratic equation of state .",
    "the study of the structure of compact stars requires understanding of the equation of state describing the stellar matter under extreme conditions .",
    "high mass compact stars , reported recently in the literature , provide strong constraints on the properties of ultradense matter beyond the saturation nuclear density . even for the 1.44 @xmath1 mass or so compact stars , we can still debate over the nature of the star , whether it is composed of nuclear matter , or quark matter or a hybrid of the both .",
    "for the hybrid scenario , the core is made of quark matter which has a softer equation of state , and the outside is a stiffer nuclear matter equation of state . in nuclear physics or particle physics , it is often quite challenging to find a single equation of state of matter that smoothly matches the quark matter core with the outer nuclear matter . in this context",
    ", it is also worth mentioning that @xcite and @xcite showed that most of the current equations of state describing quark matter are too soft and so are unable to explain the existence and stability of massive neutron stars .",
    "@xcite pointed out that only stiff equations of state describing normal nuclear matter at high densities would be capable of explaining the stability of high compact star masses with @xmath2 .",
    "consequently a lot of work has been carried out in hybrid stars with modification to the equation of state in the past years in order to address this issue . in our work , we have chosen a quadratic equation of state , which is softer at low densities and stiffer at higher densities , thus accommodating for a hybrid scenario , as we are more interested in finding the exact solution in general relativity .    in this paper",
    "we utilize the quadratic equation of state in a class of exact models found by maharaj and mafa takisa ( 2012 ) to study physical features .",
    "this enables us to consider deviations from the linear case and the changes to observable quantities such as the mass of the star .",
    "we use an exact solution of the einstein - maxwell system found earlier by @xcite to study physical features and show that this model is consistent with observed objects .",

    "<S> we model a charged anisotropic relativistic star with a quadratic equation of state . physical features of an exact solution of the einstein - maxwell system are studied by incorporating the effect of the nonlinear term from the equation of state . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to regain the masses , radii and central densities for a linear equation of state in our analysis . </S>",
    "<S> we generate masses for stellar compact objects and perform a detailed study of psr j1614 - 2230 in particular . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the influence of the nonlinear equation of state on physical features of the matter distribution . we demonstrate that it is possible to incorporate the effects of charge , anisotropy and a quadratic term in the equation of state in modelling a compact relativistic body .    _ </S>",
    "<S> key words _ : einstein - maxwell equations , compact bodies ; relativistic stars . </S>"
