    "double perovskite materials , of the form a@xmath0bbo@xmath1 , have been of interest in recent years  @xcite on account of their magnetic , electronic and structural propeties .",
    "they promise large magnetoresistance  @xcite , potentially useful for switching applications .",
    "the half - metallic character of some of the members also make them attractive candidates for spintronic devices .",
    "one of the species , b say , is typically magnetic , a transition metal like fe , co , ni , or cr , while the b species is generally non - magnetic , mo , w , _ etc_. the most studied member of this series is sr@xmath2femoo@xmath3 : it is a half - metallic ferromagnet ( fm ) at low temperature , and has a high @xmath4k .",
    "sr@xmath2fewo@xmath3 , on the other hand , is an antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator !",
    "these limits illustrate the wide range of physical properties in the double perovskites ( dp ) . while the ` endpoints ' above are relatively easy to understand ( ignoring disorder ) there are several effects where current understanding is limited .",
    "( i )  _ antisite disorder : _ well annealed double perovskites tend to have an alternate arrangement of b and b ions , but defects called ` antisite ' regions @xcite appear when two b or two b atoms occur as neighbours .",
    "these regions typically have an afm arrangement of the b spins and are insulating .",
    "their presence reduces the overall magnetization . the electronic and magnetic properties in dp s are intimately related to the structural order .",
    "( ii )  _ phase competition : _ exploration of the series  @xcite sr@xmath2femo@xmath5w@xmath6o@xmath3 reveals a fm to afm transition and an associated metal - insulator transition ( mit ) with increasing @xmath7 . in the regime of fm - afm phase competition",
    "the compounds show large magnetoresistance ( mr ) .",
    "( iii )  _ magnetic b sites : _ recently , compounds where the b site also has an intrinsic magnetic moment have been investigated  @xcite , and interesting compensation effects have been observed .",
    "in particular , there are enigmatic compounds like sr@xmath2croso@xmath3 which are insulating ( semimetallic ? ) , but at the same time ferromagnetic , with a very high @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are spin - orbit effects  @xcite in some dp s complicating the magnetic state .",
    "apporaching issues ( i)-(iii ) above directly in a finite temperature real space formulation is formidable .",
    "it requires tools that can predict magnetic properties of a double perovskite based on electronic parameters and the structural disorder .",
    "this paper is a step towards that goal where we provide a semi - analytic scheme for accessing the magnetic ground state and @xmath9 scales of a structurally ordered dp starting with a tight - binding spin - fermion model . while our primary focus is the fm regime , we also highlight issues of phase competition and antiferromagnetism which are bound to be important when doping effects are explored .",
    "the paper is organised as follows .",
    "the next section describes the double perovskite model , following which we summarise earlier work on this problem to place our work in context .",
    "we then outline the different methods used in this study .",
    "the section after describes our results , primarily within a variational scheme and an effective exchange calculation , with monte carlo results for benchmark .",
    "we then conclude , pointing out how our scheme can be extended to the antisite disordered case .",
    "the double perovskite structure of a@xmath0bbo@xmath1 can be viewed as repetition of the perovskite units abo@xmath10 and abo@xmath10 . in the ideal",
    "ordered dp the b and b octahedra alternate in each direction . in this paper",
    "we consider only the b ion to be magnetic .",
    "the superexchange coupling between the b magnetic moments is small in the ordered dp s .",
    "the important physical ingredients in the problem are : ( i )  a large @xmath11 core spin at the b site , ( ii )  strong coupling on the b site between the core spin and the itinerant electron , strongly prefering _ one _ spin polarisation of the itinerant electron , and ( iii )  delocalisation of the itinerant electron on the b - o - b network .",
    "the hamiltonian for the structurally ( b - b ) ordered double perovskites is given by : @xmath12 the @xmath13 s refer to the magnetic b sites and the @xmath14 to the non magnetic b , and the b - b hopping @xmath15 is the principal hopping in the structurally ordered dp s .",
    "we will discuss the impact of further neighbour hoppings later in the text .",
    "we have retained only one orbital on the b and b site , our formulation readily generalises to a multiple orbital situation .",
    "the @xmath16 are ` classical ' ( large @xmath11 ) core spins at the b site , coupled to the itinerant b electrons through a coupling @xmath17 .",
    "this implies that the conduction electron state at a b site is slaved to the orientation of the corresponding b spin .",
    "the difference between the ionic levels , @xmath18 , defines the ` bare ' ` charge transfer ' energy . at a later stage",
    "we will define the parameter @xmath19 as the ` true ' charge transfer energy .",
    "@xmath20 is the b electron occupation number , while @xmath21 is the b electron occupation number .",
    "we will assume @xmath22 ( keeping @xmath23 finite ) .",
    "the parameter space of the problem is defined by the electron filling , @xmath24 , the ratio @xmath25 and the temperature @xmath26 .",
    "we have ignored hubbard repulsion , b - b antiferromagnetic superexchange , and , to start with , direct hopping between b-b , or b - b .",
    "early work on the dp s was motivated by results on sr@xmath2femoo@xmath3 , where electronic structure calculations indicate that fe is in a @xmath27 configuration ( a half - filled state ) while mo is in a @xmath28 configuration .",
    "following hund s rule , fe is therefore in a high spin @xmath29 state .",
    "surprisingly , the normally nonmagnetic mo picks up a moment of @xmath30 in the opposite direction , and reduces the moment per unit cell to @xmath31 .",
    "an explanation for the induced moment on the non magnetic b species was provided @xcite by sarma _",
    "et al _ , in terms of a ` level repulsion ' between the fe and mo levels .",
    "such a scenario implies a substantial degree of hybridization between the fe and mo orbitals , and assumes that the itinerant mo electron hops through the fe sublattice .",
    "using this idea , a double - exchange ( de ) like 2-sublattice kondo lattice model was proposed for the dp s  @xcite , and solved within dynamical mean field theory by chattopadhyay and millis  @xcite , assuming a ` ferrimagnetic ' @xcite state .",
    "they obtained a @xmath32 phase diagram for different values of @xmath33 and @xmath34 and observed that the @xmath8 goes to zero at large filling , indicating the presence of some competing non ferromagnetic state .",
    "a similar result for @xmath35 was obtained by carvajal _",
    "et al _  @xcite using another two sublattice model , and ising spins . here",
    "the hopping of an electron with spin @xmath36 from a b site to a neighbouring b site is @xmath37 if @xmath36 is antiparallel to the local spin @xmath38 on that site , while it is zero if they are parallel .",
    "the authors considered only ferrimagnetic arrangements .",
    "alonso _ et al _",
    "@xcite considered a variant of millis model with the coupling @xmath39 , but with a larger number of ordering possibilities .",
    "they also took into account possible antisite defects , including a b - b hopping and superexchange which are only active when two b atoms become nearest neighbours .",
    "they considered four possible phases : ( 1 )  paramagnetic , ( 2 )  ferrimagnetic , ( 3 )  an afm phase , where the b spins in neighbouring ( 1,1,1 ) planes are antiparallel , and ( 4 )  another ferrimagnetic phase where the b spins are aligned ferromagnetically if the b are in the correct positions , and antiferromagnetically if the b ions occupy b sites due to antisite defects . among other results they found that even in the b - b ordered case ( where superexchange is not operative ) the afm phase is preferred to the fm at high band filling .",
    "all these studies , except the paper by alonso _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "concentrate on the ferromagnetic @xcite phase .",
    "they observe the decrease of @xmath8 at large filling but do not explore competing phases . secondly , while the dmft approaches provide a semianalytic treatment of the @xmath8 scales , in specific parts ( in this case ferromagnetic ) of the phase diagram , an estimate of the effective exchange between the b moments is not available .",
    "the _ ab initio _ approaches have attempted such an estimate by force fitting a ` heisenberg model ' .",
    "unfortunately , the magnetic states that emerge from the dp model , and the effective exchange that stabilises these phases arise from subtle electron delocalisation physics not captured by such methods .",
    "we also do not know of any work that allows an economnical and systematic exploration of the parameter space , @xmath24 , @xmath23 , @xmath34 , of the dp model .",
    "the present paper aims to overcome these shortcomings .",
    "the first estimate of magnetic interactions in any material is provided by _",
    "ab initio _ calculations .",
    "this is typically done by calculating the difference in ground state energy of the compound in spin polarized and spin - unpolarized configurations ; or in different magnetic ground states corresponding to different values of the spin density wave vector  @xcite .",
    "such a calculation involves all the relevant orbitals and their hybridization and provides a rough material specific estimate .",
    "however , for complex antiferromagnetic ground states one has to guess such configuration beforehand , or take a cue from experiments .",
    "there is no _ a - priori _",
    "prescription for finding them .",
    "model hamiltonian based calculations , on the other hand , have the obvious limitation that model parameters have to be inferred from elsewhere , typically _ ab initio _ studies  @xcite .",
    "the advantage , however , lies in the simplicity of the resulting model , and our ability to create a qualitative understanding using the tools of statistical mechanics .",
    "the hamiltonian appropriate to double perovskites can be studied using the following tools : ( i )  a combination of exact diagonalization and monte carlo ( ed - mc ) , ( ii )  variational calculation ( vc ) based on some family of periodic spin configurations , and ( iii )  mapping to an effective classical spin model .",
    "the ed - mc approach has the advantage of accessing the magnetic structure without bias .",
    "however , due to large computational cost , it is severely size - limited , limiting the class of magnetic structures which can be probed .",
    "a ` travelling cluster ' ( tca ) variant @xcite of ed - mc allows use of somewhat larger system size .",
    "variational calculations assuming a periodic spin background can be used for very large system size ( since there is no bulk diagonalisation needed ) but are restricted by the choice of the variational family .",
    "while we will use both ( i ) and ( ii ) above , our principal tool will be ( iii ) , where we map on the spin - fermion problem to an effective spin only model , with exchange calculated from the fermions @xcite .",
    "we describe ( i)-(iii ) in more detail below .",
    "one can solve the dp model on a finite lattice by direct numerical methods , allowing for an ` exact ' benchmark for approximate solutions .",
    "ed - mc is such a technique . here",
    ", the coupled spin - fermion problem is solved by updating the classical spins using a monte carlo , diagonalizing the fermion system at each step of the mc to infer the energy cost of the move .",
    "the method is numerically expensive and can only be used on small system sizes , @xmath40 .",
    "substantially bigger sizes , @xmath41 , can be accessed using the tca .    for the mc implementation",
    "the hamiltonian of eq  [ fullhamsfmo ] has to be cast into form appropriate for @xmath42 .",
    "this is done by performing a rotation to the local @xmath16 axis at each b site , and retaining only the electron state oriented antiparallel to @xmath16 at that site .",
    "this gives the following hamiltonian , with ` spinless ' b conduction electrons and b electrons having both spin states .",
    "there is no longer any ` infinite ' coupling in the model , and the number of degrees of freedom has been reduced to one per b site ( and 2 per b ) , so the hilbert space is a little smaller .",
    "@xmath44 and @xmath45 hop to different conduction electron projections at the neighbouring b site(s ) so the effective hopping picks up a @xmath46 dependent modulation .",
    "we will use this form of the dp model for the monte carlo .      a more analytical method used before in the double exchange context",
    "is to write down a family of spin configurations @xmath47 , denoted @xmath48 for simplicity , and calculate the electronic energy in that background . since the @xmath48 are usually periodic this is effectively a ` band structure ' calculation . for a specified chemical potential one can calculate the electronic energy @xmath49 .",
    "the configuration @xmath50 that minimises @xmath51 is the variational ground state .",
    "needless to say , the ` minimum ' is only as good as the starting set , and in general non periodic @xmath48 can not be handled .",
    "nevertheless , used in combination with mc results it can be a valuable tool .    from the mc we will discover that in the structurally ordered case the dp model has simple periodic ground states , with windows of phase separation in between .",
    "this will allow us to use the variational scheme , with only a few configurations , to map out the @xmath52 phase diagram accurately .",
    "the complications with spin - fermion mc , and the limitations of vc could be avoided if one had an explicit spin - spin interaction model deduced from the starting dp model .",
    "formally such a scheme can be written down , and some progress made through approximation .",
    "let us illustrate this ` self consistent renormalisation ' ( scr ) principle @xcite in the simpler context of double exchange before moving to the double perovskites .",
    "consider the following model : @xmath53 let us try to construct an approximate classical spin model in the limit @xmath54 .",
    "the classical model is defined by the equivalence : @xmath55 where the trace is over the fermion degrees of freedom .",
    "the trace , in general , is impossible to compute analytically since it involves the spectrum of fermions moving in an _ arbitrary _ spin background @xmath56 .",
    "nevertheless , some headway can be made once the hamiltonian is written in a more suggestive rotated and projected basis as @xcite : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 is a phase factor depending on @xmath16 and @xmath60 , and the @xmath61 are ` spinless ' fermion operators .",
    "this suggests the approximation : @xmath62 the angular brackets indicate first a quantum average ( for fixed @xmath63 ) and then thermal average over @xmath64 .",
    "another way to obtain the same result , which generalises to the dp problem , is to write the action for @xmath65 in a spin background @xmath56 : @xmath66 \\gamma_{in}^{\\dagger } \\gamma_{jn}\\ ] ] and the internal energy @xmath67 ; @xmath68 which is simply the quantum average of the spin - fermion hamiltonian for a fixed @xmath56 . as before we can convert this to an approximate spin hamiltonian by thermally averaging the quantity within the round brackets .",
    "the effective exchange depends on @xmath69 , but in the ` clean ' problem it does not depend on the ` bond ' @xmath70 .",
    "since the de model always has a ferromagnetic ground state , the low @xmath69 exchange can be calculated from the fermionic average in the _ fully polarised _ state , and is simply : @xmath71 it was observed @xcite that even at finite temperature the _ self consistent average _ in the ferromagnetic phase remains close to the @xmath52 value till very near @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath52 kinetic energy therefore provides a reasonable estimate of effective ferromagnetic exchange , and so the @xmath8 .",
    "the overall scale factor between the @xmath8 and the exchange can be determined from a monte carlo calculation .      unlike the de model we can not write an effective spin only hamiltonian for the double perovskites purely by inspection since the electron motion also involves the b sites .",
    "we use the action formulation instead . integrating out the b electrons we get an action entirely in terms of the b degrees of freedom : @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the @xmath74 greens function involving b sites only ( the @xmath24 represent matsubara frequencies ) : @xmath75",
    "if we choose @xmath76 ,  @xmath77 , this becomes : @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "the poles of this greens function give the band dispersion at @xmath74 : @xmath80 in the limit @xmath81 , i.e. , the limit of weak charge transfer , there are two bands centred roughly on @xmath82 and @xmath23 . for @xmath83 , there are two bands @xmath84 symmetrically placed about 0 .    while the first term in the action involving this bare greens function conserves spin and momentum , the second term is local in real space and typically involves spin - flip .",
    "to proceed , let us fourier transform @xmath85 and write the action in real space .",
    "@xmath86 generates ` hoppings ' ( in the full b - b lattice ) connecting sites that can either be next nearest neighbours ( 2n ) , next - to next nearest neighbours ( 3n ) , or the same site . in real space",
    "the action assumes the form : @xmath87 now , an unitary transformation is performed in spin space so that the second term in the action becomes diagonal : @xmath88 the action becomes : @xmath89 where @xmath90 .    at",
    "large @xmath34 one projects out the @xmath91 states , retaining only the terms involving the index @xmath92 .",
    "thereafter , we drop this index , redefine the b level as @xmath93 , and obtain an effective spinless fermion model similar to the case of double exchange .",
    "@xmath94 where @xmath95 as before .",
    "@xmath96 is the fourier transform of @xmath86 and connects sites on the b sublattice .",
    "it involves a nn term ( @xmath97 in the full b - b lattice ) and a third neighbour term ( @xmath98 etc in the b - b lattice ) .",
    "it is important we appreciate the various terms in the expression for @xmath99 above .",
    "the ` kernel ' @xmath100 is specified by the @xmath74 bandstructure of the b - b problem , explicit information about the spin variables is encoded in @xmath101 , and the fermions are defined _ in the background @xmath56 _ .",
    "we define @xmath102 , so @xmath103 the internal energy can be calculated as @xmath104 . simplifying the resulting expression and using the same principle as in de we can write an explicit ( but approximate ) model purely in terms of core spins :",
    "@xmath105 the effective exchange @xmath106 can be determined at any temperature by the scr method .",
    "the couplings take two values , @xmath107 for nn b - b exchange , and @xmath108 for second neighbour b - b exchange .",
    "the low @xmath69 exchange can be estimated by evaluating the fermionic average in the perfectly spin - ordered state at @xmath52 ( after checking that the ground state generated by the exchange is self - consistently ferromagnetic ) .",
    "the evaluation of the matsubara sums , _ etc _ , is discussed in appendix  a.",
    "both ed - mc done on @xmath109 , and tca done on @xmath110 exhibit the presence of three phases : namely ferromagnetic ( fm , first panel in fig.1 ) , a ` line like ' antiferromagnetic phase ( afm1 , middle panel ) and the more conventional antiferromagnet ( afm2 ) in the last panel . if we define the ordering wave - vector on b sublattice using axes along the diagonals , the fm phase has order at @xmath111 , afm1 has order at @xmath112 , and afm2 has order at @xmath113 .",

    "the afm1 phase is unobservable on even the low filling side , possibly due to very small @xmath120 .    while afm phases driven by b - b superexchange have been studied in the dp s , afm phases",
    "_ driven by electron delocalisation _ have not seen much discussion .",
    "their occurence , however , is not surprising . if we were to ` test out ' the feasibility of various magnetic ground states we could restrict ourself to a few simple collinear phases to start with .",

    "the presence of such collinear antiferromagnetic phases have been observed earlier by several authors , notably alonso _ et.al . _",
    "these phases , at least within the @xmath42 model considered here , have a a ` lower connectedness ' than the ferromagnetic phase .",

    ", however , it appears that an extra onsite term of the form @xmath157 occurs for the b sites ( @xmath158 is the number of nearest neighbours ) giving an ` exchange splitting ' at the b site , with the spins of the surrounding b sites serving as a magnetic field .",
    "the corresponding hopping terms are given by : @xmath159 within a mean - field treatment of the b core spins @xmath160 , the effective b-b ` hamiltonian ' can be written as : @xmath161 \\cr & & + \\frac{t^{2}}{2\\delta}\\sum_{<<ij>>}[(1+m ) m_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}m_{j\\uparrow}+(1-m ) m_{i\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}m_{j\\downarrow } ] \\cr & & + \\frac{2t^{2}}{\\delta}m \\sum_{i}(m_{i\\uparrow}^{\\dagger}m_{i\\uparrow}- m_{i\\downarrow}^{\\dagger}m_{i\\downarrow})\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] obviously , at @xmath52 , @xmath162 , and only one spin species hops .    the effective spin polarization at the b site , which is purely electronic , contributes to the total magnetization . within the tca approach using the hamiltonian  [ jinfinityham ] , this",

    "our ferromagnetic @xmath8 are typically @xmath175 at a filling appropriate to sfmo , so the absolute magnitude of the @xmath8-s would be about @xmath176 , roughly the range seen in the for double perovskites .    2 .  _",
    "b - b hopping : _ while we have not considered the effect of b - b hopping , the smallest energy scale in the problem , explicitly in this paper , it is possible to understand qualitatively the effect of including this hopping . if only b - b hopping is considered , then there are two singular features in the density of states , at @xmath177 and @xmath178 , or alternatively , at @xmath82 and @xmath179 .",
    "inclusion of the b-b hopping resulted , at the zeroth level , in the smoothening of the feature at @xmath178 .",
    "similarly , inclusion of the b - b hopping will basically smoothen out the feature at @xmath177 .",
    "the b-b hopping had a much more dramatic consequence in terms of providing an alternate pathway for delocalization of the b electrons irrespective of spin , especially at large @xmath23 .",
    "secondly , it resulted in connecting up of the afm1 staircases , getting rid of their 1d character , and making this phase unstable compared to the fm and afm2 phases .",

    "three dimensions : _ the entire analysis in this paper was in two dimensions .",
    "apart from simplicity , ease of visualization , and computational tractability , there is a definite argument in terms of the symmetry of the @xmath146 orbitals as long as nearest neighbour interactions are considered  @xcite , which says that one can consider three independent 2d hamiltonians .",
    "other authors  @xcite have also used 2d hamiltonians .",
    "having said that , the phases discussed here generalizes easily to three dimensions .",
    "the afm1 phase in the absence of b-b hopping becomes 2d rather than 1d , consisting of ferromagnetic [ 111 ] planes arranged antiferromagnetically .",

    "while going across the series of dp compounds sr@xmath2femoo@xmath3 , to sr@xmath2fereo@xmath3 , it is not just the filling but also all these parameters which are changing . a more controlled way of varying the filling alone would probably be to dope the compounds at the a site , namely prepare the series sr@xmath181la@xmath6femoo@xmath3 . while some work has been done in this regard  @xcite , more extensive work , probing higher doping values",
    "is necessary to ascertain whether such antiferromagnetic phases are indeed observed .",

    "paradoxical effects like increase in @xmath8 and widening of the fm region has been suggested  @xcite .",
    "the scheme for self - consistent renormalization that we have proposed can be generalized even to the case of antisite disorder ( see appendix ) .",
    "however , the scheme in that case becomes more numerical , and the analytical handle available here would be lost even at @xmath52 .",
    "the formalism is presented in the appendix and we are currently studying the problem .",
    "we have suggested a scheme for extracting a simple magnetic model for double perovskites starting with a tight binding parametrisation of the electronic structure .",
    "the ` exchange scale ' in this model is related to the electronic kinetic energy .",
    "the ferromagnetic @xmath9 estimated from this exchange compares well with results from the full spin - fermion monte carlo .",
    "the change in sign of the exchange with increasing carrier density captures the phase competition in the electronic model and the transition in the magnetic ground .",
    "our scheme , extended to include multiple bands and spin - orbit coupling would allow a controlled and economical approach to the finite temperature physics of a wide variety of double perovskites . another fruitful line of exploration is to include antisite disorder .",
    "we have highlighted the scheme in the appendix and hope to present results in the near future .",

    "if one uses a bethe lattice of infinite coordination , then the bare density of states for nearest neighbour hopping is semicircular , and analytic treatment is possible , at least for the dos . in our case",
    ", there are two bands , with dispersions @xmath191 the density of states for these bands is : @xmath192 where the bare dos @xmath193 is approximated by the semicircular dos , @xmath194 .",
    "then , the full dos given by eq  [ rho_ak_pm ] becomes : @xmath195 this integral can be evaluated , to give the following analytic result for the dos : @xmath196 @xmath197 obviously , this diverges at @xmath198 , and @xmath199 .",
    "the limits of the dos , and hence the integral , are obtained from the equations given by the two theta function conditions : @xmath200 , @xmath201 if we take @xmath202 , as in our case , then the lower band lies between @xmath203 ( left edge ) and @xmath23 ( right edge ) , while the upper band lies between @xmath82 ( left edge ) and @xmath204 ( right edge ) .",
    "when @xmath205 , i.e. , @xmath206 , the theta function conditions are only satisfied together for @xmath207 , i.e. , at @xmath198 or @xmath199 .",
    "thus we recover the bare levels as @xmath208-function peaks in the dos , as expected .    the exchange at t=0 is given in terms of this dos as : @xmath209n_{f}(e)de-\\delta n_{f}(\\delta ) \\label{u_rho}\\ ] ] this gives @xmath210 as a function of @xmath122 .",
    "one can also obtain the total number of electrons @xmath211 from the dos as a function of @xmath122 : @xmath212n_{f}(e ) \\label{n_rho}\\ ] ] from eq  [ u_rho ] and eq  [ n_rho ] , eliminating @xmath122 , one can get @xmath213 vs @xmath211 .    using the substitution @xmath214 ,",
    "the expression for the exchange can be rewritten in a more convenient form at t=0 as : @xmath215    it is to be noticed that as @xmath206 , i.e. , @xmath205 , the exchange goes to zero , as it should .",
    "this can be seen in two ways .",
    "firstly , as @xmath206 , @xmath216 . hence , the band dispersions @xmath217 given by eq  [ ak_pm_tfm_only ] tends to @xmath218 .",
    "this means that @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "hence , putting in eq  [ u_rho ] , the first term involving @xmath221 is @xmath82 , while the second term involving @xmath222 cancels the third term involving @xmath223 .    the other way to observe",
    "this is to use eq  [ u_b_subs ] . here , when @xmath205 , then the theta function condition is only satisfied for @xmath224 , which means that the only contribution to the integral comes from @xmath225",
    "indeed , the bare semicircular dos @xmath226 being a normalized object , tends to a delta function @xmath227 as @xmath205 .",
    "hence , the term involving @xmath228 sign gives @xmath82 , while that involving @xmath229 sign gives @xmath230 , which cancels with the third term .",
    "firstly , the hamiltonian has to be written in such a way that all the b and b degrees of freedom are separated out in distinct subspaces of the hamiltonian . @xmath231",
    "it is to be noted that in the ordered case , the hamiltonian matrix becomes block diagonal in k - space , and the elements of the off - diagonal block @xmath234 and @xmath235 are simply @xmath243 , while those of the digonalizing matrices @xmath239 are @xmath244 , while the eigenvalues @xmath240 are simply @xmath245 , i.e. , @xmath23 .",
    "hence , the quantity @xmath246 in the numerator simply goes over to @xmath247 , as defined in eq  [ spinmodel ]    9 d.d .",
