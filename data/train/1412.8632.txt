    "superb resolution achieved by the _ chandra _ x - ray observatory has enabled us to investigate the thermodynamical and chemodynamical properties of the x - ray emitting intracluster medium ( icm ) at greater details , including the detection of fluctuations in the surface brightness distribution of the icm . as a result",
    ", majority of the studies in the last two decades were focused on the exploration and understanding of the energetic feedback from super - massive black hole ( smbh ) residing at the core of the largest gravitationally bound systems like groups and clusters of galaxies ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "agns are believed to be powered by the binding energy released by the accretion of matter onto the smbh .",
    "now it is widely accepted that the energetic feedback from the agn plays a significant role in the evolution of galaxies as well as the icm , however , the form in which this energy is released is not yet fully understood .",
    "the commonly observed signatures of the agn interactions with the icm are the bubbles or cavities in the x - ray surface brightness distribution @xcite .",
    "in addition , sharp discontinuities or edges in the surface brightness associated with the shocks and cold fronts have also been observed in few of the clusters ( e.g. , abell 1795 , rxj1720.1 + 2638 , abell 2142 , abell 754 , abell 3667 , abell 2204 ) .",
    "these bubbles are often found in association with the cooling flow or the `` cool core '' clusters and are filled with radio emission originating from the central agn .",
    "some of the spectacular examples of the cool core clusters with radio bubbles are the perseus cluster @xcite , m87 @xcite , hydra a @xcite , ms0735.6 + 7421 @xcite , abell 3581 @xcite , hcg 62 @xcite , and abell 2052 @xcite .",
    "combined observations of the icm in the radio and x - ray bands have provided us with several incidences of common appearance of cavities , shocks and ripples , confirming the widespread impact of the agn feedback from the central smbh ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the agn feedback scenario ,",
    "the radio source associated with the central cd galaxy drives strong jet outflows which interact with the hot icm and inflate lobes of radio - synchrotron emission . as a consequence ,",
    "the gas gets displaced and results in the formation of buoyantly rising bubbles . cavities or bubbles are nothing but the depressions in the x - ray surface brightness consisting of low density relativistic plasma , that float upward in the cooling flow atmosphere until they reach equilibrium at some large radius where the ambient entropy is equal to that within the bubble @xcite",
    ".    the jet - blown cavities in the x - ray atmosphere of the clusters can act as calorimeter and hence provide a direct probe to estimate the energy input by the agn jet in the form of mechanical feedback .",
    "systematic studies employing deep observations with high resolution _",
    "chandra _ x - ray telescope have demonstrated that agn can inject upto about 10@xmath7 - 10@xmath8 erg per outburst into the icm ( see * ? ? ? * for review ) .",
    "this amount of mechanical energy injected by the agn feedback is sufficient to heat as well as quench the cooling of the icm on the cluster scales @xcite , and whose balance can be checked by comparing it with the energy lost by the icm in the form of x - ray emission . to better understand the interactions between the agn feedback and the surrounding icm ; and to confirm the balance between mechanical power fed by the agn versus that lost by the icm through the radiative loss , it is important to explore x - ray bright systems with apparent signatures of such interactions .",
    "abell 2390 , as it hosts a powerful radio source at its core , is a potential candidate to investigate such a balance between the agn feedback and radiative loss by the icm .    in this paper",
    "we present 95ks _ chandra _ observations of the cool core cluster abell 2390 ( obsid 4193 ) .",
    "this is a moderately rich cluster hosting about 216 members at a redshift of @xmath0 = 0.228 @xcite .",
    "its central dominant galaxy , pgc 140982 , hosts a strong and complex radio source ( b2151 + 174 , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "deep optical broadband images of the central dominant galaxy pgc 140982 exhibit a wealth of structures including a significant amount of dust and molecular gas surrounding the cd galaxy ( @xcite , @xcite ) and appears very luminous in the h@xmath9and ir bands @xcite .",
    "the star formation rate estimated in the core of this cluster using the h@xmath9flux is found to be 15 @xmath10/yr @xcite .",
    "icm in abell 2390 exhibit a strong peak in the x - ray surface brightness profile @xcite and also exhibit several other substructures such as x - ray cavities and breaks in the x - ray surface brightness profile ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the central cooling time of the icm in this cluster is @xmath11=1.9 gyr with @xmath12 = 60.91 kpc @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section  [ obs ] describes the data sets used for the present study and its reduction procedure , sections  [ img ] and [ spec ] discuss the imaging and spectral analysis of the data set , section  [ disc ] discussion of our results , while section  [ conc ] summarizes results from this study . throughout this paper",
    "we assume the @xmath13cdm cosmology with @xmath14 = 71 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 , @xmath15 = 0.27 , and @xmath16 = 0.73 . at the redshift of abell 2390 ( @xmath0 = 0.228 ) this cosmology corresponds to a scale of 1= 3.62 kpc and the luminosity distance of the cluster @xmath17 1125 mpc ( table  [ basicpro ] ) .",
    "all the errors reported in this paper are at 68@xmath18 confidence level ( i.e. 1@xmath19 ) unless otherwise stated .",
    "abell 2390 was observed with the _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis - s ) three times during november 1999 and september 2003 with effective exposure times of 10ks ( obsid 500 ) , 10ks ( obsid 501 ) and 95ks ( obsid 4193 ) .",
    "obsids 500 and 501 were performed in the faint mode and were badly affected by the background flares .",
    "therefore , we acquired level 1 event file corresponding to the obsid 4193 and reprocessed it using the latest version of the ciao software ( ciao v 4.2 ) and calibration files caldb 4.5.5.1 provided by the _",

    "this resulted in the net exposure time of 88.63ks .",
    "as diffuse x - ray emission from abell 2390 fills the image field of view , therefore standard caldb blank sky background frames were preferred for the background correction .",
    "the appropriate blank - sky background frames were processed in a similar way as that of the event file , reprojected to the corresponding sky position and were normalized to match the count rate in the 9 - 12kev energy band in the observed data set .",
    "the background subtracted science frame was then divided by the exposure map generated using the _ mkexpmap _ so as to account for the exposure variation of the data .",

    "[ cavitypro ]    x - ray cavities or depressions in the surface brightness distribution are devoid of gas at the local ambient temperature and are believed to be formed due to the interactions between the agn outbursts and the hot icm . during an agn outburst , the jets emanating from the central source do _ pv _ work on the surrounding icm , inflate cavities which then rises buoyantly in the plane of the sky .",
    "thus , it is possible to quantify the amount of mechanical energy that has been injected by the jets into the icm from the analysis of the x - ray cavities @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the x - ray cavities act as a calorimeter to estimate the mechanical power injected by the agn in to the icm without requiring radio observations of the central source",
    ".    systematic analysis of the 95ks _ chandra _ data on abell 2390 enabled us to detect a total of five x - ray cavities in the central 30region . assuming that each cavity takes spheroidal or oblate sphere geometry with its minor axis in the plane of the sky and filled with the material of negligible mass @xcite",
    ", we estimate power of the cavities ( @xmath25 ) as the ratio of the energy contained by the cavities to their ages .",

    "the buoyancy rise time is the time taken by the cavity to reach its terminal velocity , which depends on the drag forces . in the case of clearly detached cavities ,",

    "our estimates of the age of the cavities using the buoyancy rise method listed in table  [ cavitypro ] were used to quantify their power content . the net power supplied by the central agn in the form of the mechanical energy",

    "x - ray cavities in the icm are thought to be inflated by radio jets originating from the agn , that rise buoyantly until they reach density equilibrium with the surrounding icm .",
    "therefore , with an objective to examine association of the core of the abell 2390 with a radio source , we make use of the 1.4 ghz vla l - band radio data available in the _ nrao science data archive_. the diffuse radio emission contours at 1.4 ghz from abell 2390 from their analysis are overlaid on the 0.5 - 3kev _ chandra _ unsharp mask image ( figure  [ fig : unsharp_radio1 ] ) .",
    "the radio emission morphology exhibits a complex nature that nearly match with the x - ray .",
    "the strongest radio source at the centre coincides with the cluster dominant cd galaxy pgc 140982 , while the diffuse radio emission at 1.4 ghz is found to cover all the detected x - ray cavities .",
    "though , its morphology is highly asymmetric .",
    "the radio emission also exhibits a sharp edge on the south - east direction , while another more complex edge on the north - west direction due to several discrete radio sources is evident in this figure @xcite . this complex edge in radio emission is found to coincide with the x - ray edge evident in the _ chandra _ unsharp mask image ( figure  [ fig : unsharp_radio1 ] ) .",
    "the extended 1.4 ghz diffuse radio emission along the north - west and the south - east directions exhibit its spatial association with the cool icm evident in the temperature map ( figure  [ fig : cont_maps ] _ left panel _ ) .",
    "association of the strong radio source with the cooling flow cluster abell 2390 suggest that this cluster falls in the class of the radio mini - halo and is similar in size to that of the perseus cluster @xcite .",
    "non - spherical and more irregular morphology of diffuse radio emission from abell 2390 is similar to that seen in the mini - halo of a2626 @xcite .",
    "we also plot the radio emission contours at 4.8ghz ( blue ) and 8.4ghz ( cyan ) from the vla data in the same figure .",
    "emission at higher frequencies appears to be confined only to the central @xmath17 20region .",
    "radiative cooling of the icm can be estimated by measuring x - ray luminosity of the hot gas within cooling radius of a cluster . in the present case for abell 2390",
    "it is found to be equal to @xmath49 corresponding to the radius of 60.91 kpc and cooling time of 1.9gyr @xcite .",
    "this means , in the absence of heating source , the cluster icm would have radiated away all of its thermal energy over the time less than age of the cluster . however , estimate of the x - ray luminosity using deep x - ray data required some heating , e.g. agn feedback , to make up for the power radiated from within this region in order to suppress cooling .",
    "this means , to balance the radiative cooling , the average energy input by the agn outburst must be of the order or higher than the rate of radiative cooling . to examine efficiency of the agn feedback ,",
    "estimated mechanical power injected by the agn from x - ray cavity analysis .",

    "4.04@xmath4 10@xmath53 erg s@xmath6 by almost an order of magnitude . to further elucidate this balance between the two ,",
    "we make use of the figure 6 by @xcite , where they plot the agn power against the total radiative luminosity of the icm within cooling radius ( figure  [ fig : pcav_lx ] _ left panel _ ) .",
    "the diagonal lines in this plot indicate their equivalence ( @xmath54 ) at 1@xmath29 , 4@xmath29 and 16@xmath29 of total enthalpy ( from top to bottom , respectively ) .",
    "filled black symbols indicate data points for the cluster sample from @xcite , while that indicated by filled square is for a1991 @xcite .",
    "error bars indicate the 1@xmath19 uncertainties in the cavity power estimation .",
    "we also plot position of abell 2390 in the same figure so as to check the balance between the two ( filled triangle ) and is found to occupy the position above the 1@xmath29 line .",
    "this means , mechanical power fed by the central agn associated with abell 2390 is sufficiently large to inflate the cavities and to balance cooling of the icm without requiring any additional contribution from the energy available with the relativistic particles and the magnetic field of the radio jets .    @xcite demonstrate that every massive cooling flow cluster with x - ray cavities hosts a radio source at its core with a radio luminosity greater than 2.5@xmath4 10@xmath55 erg s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 . following this",
    ", we explored the availability of radio data on this system and found that abell 2390 is associated with a radio source of flux 235.3 mjy at 1.4ghz @xcite .",
    "the radio power of the central source associated with abell 2390 was calculated using the relation @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath0 and @xmath9 represent the luminosity distance , flux density at frequency @xmath59 , redshift and the radio spectral index ( assuming @xmath60 ) , respectively .",
    "this lead to the radio power at 1.4ghz equal to @xmath17 5.01@xmath4 10@xmath61 erg s@xmath6 .",
    "thus , abell 2390 meets the requirement of @xcite and therefore increases the possibility of cavity heating of the icm .",
    "we used this to confirm the balance between the two by plotting the mechanical power of cavities from x - ray study against the 1.4ghz radio power of the central radio source as suggested by @xcite and is shown in figure  [ fig : pcav_lx ] ( _ right panel _ ) .",
    "the long dashed red line in this figure represents the best fit relation obtained by @xcite for a sample of giant ellipticals ( ges ) with upper and lower limits shown by the short dashed blue lines . in this plot abell 2390",
    "is found to occupy position much above the best - fit line obtained by @xcite , implying that our estimate of mechanical power using the x - ray data requires a much powerful radio source to meet the balance .",
    "our estimate of the cavity power ( @xmath51 5.94@xmath4 10@xmath5 erg s@xmath6 ) matches within error with that ( @xmath51 1.0@xmath11.0 @xmath4 10@xmath62 erg s@xmath6 ) reported by @xcite .",
    "the measured values of radio flux densities at 1.4 ghz leads to the radio power equal to @xmath17 5.01@xmath4 10@xmath61 erg s@xmath6 with a ratio of the two powers ( @xmath63 / @xmath25 ) equal to @xmath64 , which is lower compared to the theoretical range of @xmath65 - @xmath66 obtained by @xcite as well as the reported values by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this lower value is probably due to the uncertainties in the estimation of volume of the x - ray cavities . as volume measurement",
    "is carried out by the visual inspection of the cavities in the x - ray image , therefore , is prone to systematic errors .",
    "according to @xcite volume estimation as well as radio emission is also less sensitive to projection effect .",
    "if we consider total radio power over the frequency range 10 mhz to 10 ghz ( @xmath17 3.67@xmath4 10@xmath67 erg s@xmath6 ) , this ratio turns out to be @xmath68 .",
    "similar values of the ratio of the two power estimates have also been reported for few other cases e.g. ngc 4636 @xcite , hcg 62 @xcite and few other sources @xcite , where the mechanical power estimated from cavity analysis is found to exceed by about 4 orders of magnitude compared with the radio power .",
    "@xcite for the case of hcg 62 , where @xmath63 / @xmath25 @xmath64 , have demonstrated that the synchrotron radio luminosity can not be taken as a reliable gauge of the total mechanical power of the agn outburst .",
    "this is because the radio sources may be very poor , time - variable radiators or may fade with time .",
    "another possibility is that the radio source associated with abell 2390 is sufficiently powerful , whose power compares with that of cygnus a , however , the denser environment of the cluster does not allow us to envisage the symmetrically placed lobes on either sides of the nucleus .    another convincing probe for the agn heating",
    "was provided by the nature of the entropy profile in central region of abell 2390 .",
    "the radial entropy profile derived for abell 2390 falls systematically in the radially inward direction with a floor at 12.20@xmath12.54kev @xmath3 in the core region .",
    "if the cooling of the icm is not compensated by the agn heating , it would have radiated away whole of its thermal energy on the hubble timescale and hence entropy would have collapsed to a very low value . however , the flattening of the entropy index towards the central projected value of 12.20@xmath12.54kev @xmath3 strongly point towards an intermittent heating of the icm by the strong agn feedback @xcite .",
    "@xcite using the _ spitzer _ and _ herschel _ data estimate the star formation rate in the core of this system to be equal to @xmath17 9 @xmath10/yr . however , this estimate is significantly smaller than that expected by the standard cooling flow model , implying that the agn is regulating it through the feedback process .",
    "they also found a strong correlation between the infrared luminosity and the cluster x - ray gas cooling time , suggesting that the star formation in this system is strongly influenced by the cluster - scale cooling process .",
    "thus , all the attempts made here to relate the jet / cavity power with the x - ray / radio luminosity imply that the agn outburst from the core of the abell 2390 is capable enough to quench the cooling and also to carve the morphology of the icm .",
    "in this paper we have presented systematic analysis of 95ks high resolution _",
    "chandra _ data on a cooling flow cluster abell 2390 with an objective to investigate properties of the x - ray cavities apparent in the surface brightness distribution .",
    "1.4 ghz vla l - band data reveals an association of a strong radio source with the cd galaxy pgc 140982 at the core of this cluster .",
    "comparison of the x - ray and radio data exhibit a strong interplay between the central radio source and the icm , indicating that the cool core cluster abel 2390 is an important source to investigate the agn feedback .",
    "main results from this study are summarized below :    * our morphological analysis using a total of 95ks _ chandra _ data confirms the presence of a pair of x - ray cavities predicated by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "additionally , this study has detected three more x - ray cavities in the central 30region .",
    "the presence of these cavities have been confirmed by a variety of image processing techniques i.e. , unsharp mask image , 2d elliptical-@xmath69 model subtracted residual image as well as by the surface brightness profiles derived along four different sectors . * projected radial temperature profile reveals a positive temperature gradient in the central region , like those seen in several other cooling flow clusters . * temperature profiles derived along the four different wedge - shaped sectors revealed temperature jump in the all directions at a projected distance of @xmath1725and another jump from 7.47kev to 9.10kev in the west direction at a projected distance of 68(246 kpc ) .",
    "these jumps in temperature are due to the cold fronts and their corresponding mach numbers are 1.44@xmath10.05 and 1.22@xmath10.06 . *",
    "tricolour map as well as hardness ratio map detects cool gas clumps in the central 30 kpc region of temperature @xmath2kev .",

    "the entropy profile derived from the x - ray analysis is found to fall systematically inward in a power - law fashion and exhibits a floor near 12.20@xmath12.54kev @xmath3 in the central region .",
    "this flattening of the entropy profile in the core region confirms the intermittent heating at the centre by agn . * the diffuse radio emission map at 1.4ghz using vla l - band data exhibits highly asymmetric morphology with an edge in the north - west direction coinciding with the x - ray edge seen in the unsharp mask image . * the mechanical power injected by the agn in the form of x - ray cavities",

    "<S> we present results based on the systematic analysis of high resolution 95ks _ chandra _ observations of the strong cool core cluster abell 2390 at the redshift of @xmath0 = 0.228 that hosts an energetic radio agn . </S>",
    "<S> this analysis has enabled us to investigate five x - ray deficient cavities in the atmosphere of abell 2390 within central 30 . </S>",
    "<S> presence of these cavities have been confirmed through a variety of image processing techniques like , the surface brightness profiles , unsharp masked image , as well as 2d elliptical model subtracted residual map . </S>",
    "<S> temperature profile as well as 2d temperature map revealed structures in the distribution of icm , in the sense that icm in the nw direction is cooler than that on the se direction . </S>",
    "<S> temperature jump in all directions is evident near 25(90.5 kpc ) corresponding to the average mach number 1.44@xmath10.05 , while another jump from 7.47 kev to 9.10 kev at 68(246 kpc ) in the north - west direction , corresponding to mach number 1.22@xmath10.06 and these jumps are associated with the cold fronts . </S>",
    "<S> tricolour map as well as hardness ratio map detects cool gas clumps in the central 30 kpc region of temperature @xmath2kev . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy profile derived from the x - ray analysis is found to fall systematically inward in a power - law fashion and exhibits a floor near 12.20@xmath12.54kev @xmath3 in the central region . </S>",
    "<S> this flattening of the entropy profile in the core region confirms the intermittent heating at the centre by agn . </S>",
    "<S> the diffuse radio emission map at 1.4ghz using vla l - band data exhibits highly asymmetric morphology with an edge in the north - west direction coinciding with the x - ray edge seen in the unsharp mask image . the mechanical power injected by the agn in the form of x - ray cavities </S>",
    "<S> is found to be 5.94@xmath410@xmath5 ergs@xmath6 and is roughly an order of magnitude higher than the energy lost by the icm in the form of x - ray emission , confirming that agn feedback is capable enough to quench the cooling flow in this cluster . </S>"
