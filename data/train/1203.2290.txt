    "the problem of vacuum energy is probably one of the most interesting puzzles of modern physics .",
    "the observable energy density of the vacuum is at least 60 orders of magnitude smaller than the value expected from the standard model .",
    "there is no known natural way to derive the tiny cosmological constant used in cosmology from particle physics .",
    "these problem can be explained through the anthropic principle . in a well - known article @xcite",
    ", weinberg estimated the upper limit for the effective cosmological constant as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is an observable value .",
    "higher values suppress hierarchical structure formation in the universe , and , therefore , lead to cosmologies completely devoid of life as we know it .",
    "a further development in the application of anthropic argument was the inclusion of selection rules such as a self - sampling assumption or `` mediocrity principle '' , namely the notion that there is nothing very unusual about our civilization .",
    "acceptance of mediocrity principle , grounded on statistical approach , explicitly implies the existence of a multiverse that serves a role of a statistical ensemble . in multiverse",
    ", we can estimate the probabilities of observing any given event @xmath3 .",
    "such a probability is factorized as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the concentration of j - type bubbles and @xmath6 is the anthropic factor proportional to a total amount of observers residing inside the j - type bubble .    at first glance",
    "it may seem that the approach based on ( [ factor ] ) , could solve the problem of cosmological constant .",
    "indeed , the anthropic factor decreases with increasing @xmath7 .",
    "however , there is another difficulty . as we shall see , when @xmath8 the number of observers within a bubble increases and tends to infinity .",
    "this phenomenon may be called the `` infrared divergence '' @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore the value @xmath0 is preferred from the anthropic point of view .",
    "the main plane of article is the following .",
    "the next section is devoted to calculations of probabilities in multiverse according to ( [ factor ] ) .",
    "the existence of the `` infrared divergence '' is demonstrated . in the third section",
    "we use another method to calculate the probabilities that the divergence does nt appear . in conclusion",
    "possible objections are considered .",
    "the probability @xmath10 to find oneself in a universe with a given value of vacuum energy can be determined via @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an a priori probability distribution ( the relative abundance of different values of @xmath7 associated with the different types of bubbles in the multiverse ) , and @xmath13 is an anthropic factor proportional to the total number of observers in a given region of a multiverse . the aforementioned number is evidently related to the star formation rate @xcite , which can be estimated from the astrophysical data : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the star formation rate in a comoving volume @xmath16 and @xmath17 defines a time of collapse .",
    "obviously , for those universes whose expansion has a de sitter - type asymptote @xmath18 .",
    "if the universe has zero curvature and the radiation is small enough , the friedman equations become integrable and the scale factor may be written as @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 is a dimensionless time @xmath22 .    in order to calculate the comoving volume , @xmath16",
    ", we ll use the causal patch cut off .",
    "the causal patch is the region within the cosmological horizon @xcite , @xcite .",
    "such a choice will result in @xmath23 for @xmath24 the scale factor changes according to a power law @xmath25 when @xmath9 , @xmath26 diverges .",
    "the anthropic factor is inversely related to the cosmological constant .",
    "the resulting @xmath27 will be determined by the previously chosen function @xmath12 .",
    "the natural choice is a flat prior distribution i.e. @xmath28 , because the interval of anthropically acceptable values of @xmath7 is small in comparison with planck scale .",
    "as we shall see , for such a distribution the probability to find oneself in a universe with smaller values of cosmological constant is larger . therefore the case @xmath0 is preferred .",
    "* remark*. one note that for @xmath0 eq .",
    "( [ vc ] ) is not applicable . in this case",
    "the infinity does not follow by formally taking the limit as @xmath29 .",
    "but for friedmann universe without vacuum energy there is no cosmological horizon and therefore the comoving volume is infinite .",
    "lets consider this fact in detail .",
    "the behavior of @xmath30 for our universe depends on the particular model of star formation @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite . however , the difference in @xmath30 using different star formation models is not large , since all these models predict that @xmath30 reaches a maximum after a couple of billions of years and then is subject to a relatively fast decrease . the height and the width of the maximum depend on the cosmological constant .",
    "bousso and leichenauer ( hereafter bl ) , developed a semi - analytic model @xcite of the star formation rate as a function of time , studying in particular how spatial curvature , amplitude of primordial density perturbations , and cosmological constant influence the sfr .",
    "differently from previous papers ( e.g. , hernquist & springel 2003 , hereafter hs ) their model is principally interested in how large changes in the studied parameters affect the sfr .",
    "hs model , for example is no longer valid when one studies sfr under large variations of the quoted parameters .    in order to understand the shape of the sfr",
    ", we have to recall two things :    \\a ) structure formation originates from tiny perturbations already present in the early universe .",
    "they expanded with universe and collapsed before recombination giving rise to dark matter haloes that formed the gravitational wells in which baryons felt after recombination ;    \\b ) there was no star formation until structure formed with @xmath31 k. after structure formed , the sfr started to rise and reached a maximum .",
    "apparently there are significant differences between the results of bl model and hs and his calculations .",
    "one should point out that bl star formation model predicts that the rate at the present day is much smaller than in the other models .",
    "also the other models seem to fit the data better at these late times .",
    "this is natural , since these models are adjusted to fit the data and bl model is not .",
    "this is also why the other two models closely agree with each other close to the present epoch .",
    "a similar question arise concerning the height and position of peaks in these models .",
    "the top amplitude of sfr differs significantly : the biggest in bl model , the smallest for the fossil model @xcite . in reality , the data about the peak of the star formation rate is much less certain @xcite .",
    "one can see that the other models do not agree with each other concerning the epoch when the peak formed and its width . according to bl ( private communication ) the data , for large redshift , near the peak ,",
    "was not as reliable as the data for small redshift and so it s much less clear which model is closer to reality .",
    "the detailed calculations in @xcite show that for sufficiently wide range of @xmath7 , sfr varies only slightly ( all other parameters remain fixed to the observed values ; see especially figs . 3 and 4 in @xcite ) .",
    "one question at this point is why for large @xmath7 values , the sfr weakly depends on @xmath7 ( e.g. , @xmath32 ) , while for small @xmath7 ( @xmath33 ) , we have the same sfr , and the same total stellar mass production per unit of comoving volume as in our universe .",
    "a brief explanation of this issue is that in universe , star formation peaked around 3 gyr and dropped off since then for a number of reasons . at 3 gyr",
    "the cosmological constant was dynamically unimportant and we might as well set it to zero .",
    "vacuum energy became important only several gyr later , when star formation was already lower . without a cosmological constant , it is true that there would be more mergers in the future but these will mostly be halos that are too massive to cool efficiently .",
    "so while @xmath7 does suppress hierarchical structure formation in the future , it has little effect on star formation , and decreasing @xmath7 would not significantly increase star formation in the future .",
    "therefore , when one is interested in numerical estimations , one can assume ( for example in the range @xmath34 ) that : @xmath35 the accuracy of these estimates , in any case , is limited by our knowledge of star formation mechanisms . in the following ,",
    "we consider the analytical fit for star formation rate in our universe given in @xcite .",
    "the dependence of sfr from redshift @xmath36 is @xmath37}{b - a+a\\exp\\left[b(z - z_m)\\right ] } , \\label{eqnoldfit}\\ ] ] with @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 is the maximal star formation rate at @xmath42 .",
    "we plot this expression in fig .",
    "1(a ) , where the star formation rate reaches a peak at a redshift @xmath43 , declining roughly exponentially towards both low and high redshift . using the well - known relation between @xmath44 and redshift @xmath36 @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the hubble constant in our time and @xmath47",
    ", we can derive the time dependence of @xmath30 depicted in fig .",

    "this assumption is in a good agreement with vimos vlt deep survey data @xcite . according to vvds , sfr declines steadily by a factor 4 from @xmath57 to @xmath58 , since in this phase both giant and intermediate galaxy populations decline .",
    "the most luminous sources ceased to efficiently produce new stars 12 gyrs ago ( at @xmath59 ) , while intermediate luminosity sources continued to produce stars till 2.5 gyrs ago ( at @xmath60 ) .",

    "in the quoted figures , data of numerical calculations are marked by crosses , while solid lines are analytical fits .",

    "if the eternal inflation model is correct , this implies the existence of multiverse , containing infinite number of copies of every possible observer . what can we tell about probabilities of a event in such a multiverse",

    "some other possibilities for the measure definition have been proposed so far @xcite-@xcite .    among the various approaches to measure problem",
    ", one should notice the one described in @xcite .",
    "the key idea , in @xcite , is that one need to replace volume weighting of probabilities by volume averaging .",
    "according to this assumption the relative probabilities are proportional to expectation values of the fraction of the number of locations in which the observation occurs .",
    "the latter value is proportional to a number of observers per unit 4-volume , i.e. the number of occurred observations per unit spatial volume per unit of time .",
    "therefore one need to compare the densities of observers instead their numbers .",
    "initially , volume averaging was introduced in order to solve the boltzmann brain ( bb ) problem @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this problem can be described as follows .",
    "let`s consider toy multiverse containing only two types of universe .",
    "the universe of first type ( i ) expands forever while the universe of second type ( ii ) has a finite size and finite lifetime . in i",
    "- universes , `` ordinary observers '' , like ourselves , should be vastly outnumbered by infinite number of bbs , arising from vacuum fluctuations . in ii - universes",
    "only a finite number of ordinary observers exists , therefore the ' ordinary observers  in such multiverse are highly atypical . as pointed in @xcite replacing the volume weighting measure with volume averaging can avoid the bb catastrophe because the density of bbs is much less than the density of ordinary observers .",
    "volume averaging also has a deep link with quantum mechanics @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "one can show that volume averaging eliminates the `` infrared divergence '' .",
    "the spatial volume corresponding to comoving volume in ( [ vc ] ) is @xmath83 obviously , for @xmath84 , @xmath85 converges to @xmath86 , i.e. to the hubble volume of bubble .",
    "the 4-volume therefore is @xmath87 and diverges at @xmath84 .",
    "the density of observers per unit 4-volume tends to zero for long - lived de sitter vacua , but the relative density of observers is non - zero @xmath88 so the probability to find oneself in a universe with given value of @xmath7 becomes a well - defined function of @xmath7 .",
    "combining ( [ nrel ] ) and ( [ aver ] ) gives the following result @xmath89 the dependence of @xmath90 on @xmath7 is depicted on fig .",
    "5 for @xmath91 ( thin solid line ) , 7.5 ( thin dotted line ) , 10 ( thick solid line ) , and 12.5 gyr ( thick dotted line ) .",
    "hence the density of observers reaches its maximum for a value @xmath92 of the vacuum energy .",
    "the value of this maximum decreases with increasing time delay . for a time delay 2.5 gyr@xmath9312.5 gyr",
    ", we have @xmath94 . for larger values of vacuum energy ,",
    "@xmath95 one has to take into account the star formation decline due to early dominance of vacuum energy .",
    "finally , it remains to show that volume averaging does not lead to singularities in the case @xmath0 .",
    "lets consider the unit comoving volume in such universe .",
    "the total stellar mass within this unit volume can be estimated as @xmath96 the corresponding 4-volume increases with time according to the law @xmath97 hence the density of observers is equal to @xmath98 and it is easy to see that @xmath99 so the point @xmath0 is not singular .    , title=\"fig : \" ] +",
    "some questions remain to be answered .",
    "they are the following :      the traditional approach is that the observable universe is assumed a typical one .",
    "it seems to us that this methodology only complicates the understanding of the real universe . in our opinion",
    ", the knowledge of fundamental laws is enough to estimate parameters of a `` typical '' ( from anthropic point of view ) universe .",
    "subsequent comparison of these parameters with the observed values in our universe help us to find an answer to the aforementioned question .",
    "one note also that according to our calculations ( fig .",
    "5 ) the probability to find oneself in the universe with @xmath100 is only 1.5 - 3 times higher than probability to find oneself in the universe with @xmath101 .",
    "therefore the observed value of vacuum energy lies in the reasonable region .",
    "negative values of @xmath7 .",
    "one can notice that , for @xmath102 , the volume averaging also eliminates `` infrared divergence '' at @xmath103 .",
    "hence regularization scheme based on volume averaging gives correct answers for @xmath102 .",
    "but the following problem appears .",
    "if vacuum energy is negative , universe ends its existence in big crunch singularity . in this case",
    "the density of observers is larger than in the case of a de sitter universe , because the 4-volume of anti de sitter universe is much less .",
    "so , why we do nt live in universe with negative @xmath7 ?",
    "firstly , this problem occurs in the _ prediction _ stage , but it disappears at the _ explanatory _ stage when cosmological constant has already been measured by the observer . according to @xcite , only the observers with similar informational content can be assigned to the same equivalence class .",
    "the sign of the cosmological constant is already known for us .",
    "hence we are representatives of the reference class which includes all observers for which @xmath104 .",
    "when calculating probabilities one should consider only observers belonging to this class .    secondly , there may exists a physical mechanism , unknown to date , imposing the bounds on the lifetime ( and 4-volume ) of de sitter universe @xcite , @xcite .",
    "an interesting scenario was suggested in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "according to this scenario our vacuum should be rather unstable and should decay within 20 gyr ( which is possible if the gravitino is superheavy ) .",
    "in conclusion it should be emphasized that the main result of the present paper is the proof that replacing volume weighting with volume averaging in the cosmological measure , can avoid the infrared divergence problem .",
    "volume averaging leads to natural explanation of the reason why the observed value of vacuum energy is non - zero .",
    "perhaps this result can be considered as argument in favor of using volume averaging measure in cosmology ."
