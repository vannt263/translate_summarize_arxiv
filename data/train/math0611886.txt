    "the basic idea is as follows .",
    "the event @xmath97 is defined in terms of the continuous - space force field @xmath70 and is therefore hard to control .",
    "we bound it in terms of discrete events , by dividing space into a grid of cubes of side length @xmath183 .",
    "introduce a gravitational potential energy function @xmath184 whose differences @xmath185 are the line integral of the gravitational force .",
    "let @xmath186 .",
    "if there is a gravitational flow curve @xmath187 crossing between @xmath98 and @xmath99 , then either @xmath188 for some @xmath189 ( an event which can be shown to be of negligible probability ) , or if not , then `` many '' ( a positive fraction ) of the @xmath190-grid cubes intersected by the curve @xmath187 have the property that either @xmath191 for @xmath32 in that part of @xmath187 that intersects the cube or the change in potential energy along that part of the curve that intersects the cube is smaller than a constant times @xmath192 .",

    "detailed large deviations estimates are obtained for the gravitational potential , the force and its derivative .",
    "the joint distribution of the vector of values of forces at a given set of points is analyzed in detail . in the analysis of the bad cubes ,",
    "it is necessary to bound the contributions to the potential energy from two asymptotic regimes : first , from the effects of nearby stars causing the potential function to be close to @xmath198 ; this is dealt with using a separate percolation argument .",
    "second , from the `` intermediate '' range consisting of the scales between @xmath190 and @xmath199 ; these contributions are dealt with by diluting the set of potentially bad cubes by at most a factor @xmath200 and using a geometric covering lemma .",

    "a more delicate argument is required involving a potential energy function that is not translation - invariant and has worse large - deviation behavior than in high dimensions .",
    "we now show how theorem [ thm2 ] follows from theorem [ thm3 ] and proposition [ rearrangement ] .    first , the fact that @xmath202 as @xmath203 clearly implies that a.s.all the basins of attraction are bounded .    next , let @xmath204 be the star whose basin of attraction contains @xmath21 , and let @xmath205 be the basin of attraction of @xmath180 .",
