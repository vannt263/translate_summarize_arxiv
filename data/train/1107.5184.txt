    "thus , the realistic electronic state of the fe@xmath8 ions is rather close to @xmath9 than @xmath10 , being free from the strong jahn - teller instability @xcite .",
    "the origin of the spiral spin order has been ascribed to the competition between the ferromagnetic nearest - neighbor interaction and the antiferromagnetic next - nearest - neighbor interaction @xcite or to the double - exchange mechanism working in the negative ct energy system @xcite .",
    "so far , the magnetic state of srfeo@xmath0 has been found not to be straightforward at all . while the proper - screw spin order with a propagation vector @xmath11 along @xmath12111@xmath13 below 134 k was confirmed by neutron diffraction experiments",
    "@xcite , the occurrence of two more successive transitions near 110 k and 60 k has been reported on the basis of resistivity and magnetization data @xcite .",

    "we attributed this hysteretic behavior to the @xmath14-induced rotation of the helimagnetic domains which are originally degenerate with the @xmath43 vectors along one of the equivalent four @xmath12111@xmath13 directions at zero field in the cubic symmetry , as reported for mnsi @xcite .",

    "3 ) , while @xmath2 is almost linear with @xmath14 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . this behavior is characteristic of the spin scattering of the conduction electrons that is suppressed by the magnetic field .",
    "the negative mr at 40 t is as large as -30 % in the temperature range involving these phases .",
    "in addition , the slope of @xmath22 vs @xmath14 curves shows a gradual change without significant anomalies upon the transitions as iii @xmath45 v @xmath45 paramagnetic phase .",
    "these results suggest that the spin fluctuation in phases iii and v is significantly large , even comparable to the paramagnetic phase . in phase ii , by contrast , a positive mr is observed , implying that the proper - screw like spin structure is deformed into a nontrivial spin texture by the application of @xmath14 .    at 88 k ,",
    "the reentrant behavior in mr accompanied with hystereses was observed in the @xmath14 range of 14@xmath1923 t , corresponding to the first - order transitions as ii @xmath45 iv @xmath45 v. the application of @xmath14 transforms the proper - screw spin structure into the ferromagnetic one through an intermediate state such as conical or fan - like spin structure @xcite .",
    "when @xmath14 is parallel to the screw axis , the proper - screw spin structure would continuously transform into conical spin structure .",
    "however , when @xmath14 is perpendicular to the screw axis , the fan - like spin structure is favored for the system with strong planar anisotropy , whereas the transverse conical spin structure with the cone axis parallel to @xmath14 becomes more stable in the absence of the strong anisotropy . in the case of srfeo@xmath0",
    ", the magnetic anisotropy is expected to be rather small , since the orbital moment in the @xmath9 state is quenched under the cubic crystal field .",
    "in fact , the saturation magnetic fields for all the directions of @xmath12111@xmath13 , @xmath12110@xmath13 , and @xmath12100@xmath13 are almost identical ( data not shown ) .",
    "therefore , the fan - like spin structure can be ruled out and the conical spin structure would be the most likely candidate for the intermediate states such as phases iv and v. there are two possible states for the conical spin structures , the one having a single helimagnetic domain with @xmath11 vector parallel to @xmath14 and the other having helimagnetic domains with multiple @xmath11 vectors along the equivalent four @xmath12111@xmath13 directions . from the viewpoint of entropy , the former and the latter are expected to be realized in phases iv and v , respectively .",
    "thus , the increase in @xmath22 on the transition from phase iv to v reflects the enhancement of the fluctuation of localized spins and/or the presence of the helimagnetic @xmath43 domains .",
    "characterization of phases i and ii has been performed through the hall resistivity measurements . figure 5(a ) shows @xmath27 as a function of @xmath14 at selected temperatures . above 110 k involving phases iii and v ,",
    "@xmath27 is linearly proportional to @xmath14 , reflecting the anomalous hall effect ( ahe ) proportional to @xmath2 that is almost proportional to @xmath14 , in addition to the normal hall effect ( nhe ) as the @xmath7-type conductor .",
    "below 110 k down to 60 k , @xmath27 shows nonlinear behavior with a steep decrease at around 10 t. provided that the fictitious magnetic field @xmath46 in the real space contributes to @xmath27 in addition to the conventional terms proportional to @xmath14 ( nhe ) and @xmath2 ( ahe ) , @xmath27 can be represented by the following equation , @xmath47 here , we assumed that conduction electrons coupled to the spin texture can sense the @xmath46 , or equivalently the berry phase . since @xmath2 increases with increasing @xmath14 ,",
    "the negative contribution to @xmath27 observed for phase ii can be assigned to @xmath48 .",
    "considering that there would be helimagnetic chiral domains , this result signifies that the topological hall effect is induced by a helical spin texture with a multiple-@xmath11 structure , such as the skyrmion lattice , where the scalar spin chirality is present but is not dependent on the swirling direction of the spins .    in fig .",
    "5(c ) , a contour map of @xmath49 is superimposed on the @xmath14-@xmath42 phase diagram of srfeo@xmath0 , which highlights the negative contribution of @xmath50 . on the verge of phase ii , near the multicritical point shared by phases ii , iii , and v , the negative @xmath49 region suggesting the presence of the nontrivial , topological spin texture .",
    "the emergence of this state was clearly seen in the temperature dependence of @xmath49 at 10 t ( see fig .",
    "5(b ) ) . as decreasing temperature",
    ", @xmath49 drops dramatically upon the transition from phase iii to ii , followed by recovering to be positive and approaching a much larger value than that in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "to summarize , we have found at least five kinds of magnetically ordered phases in srfeo@xmath0 in the temperature - magnetic field plane , presumably all with helical spin modulations . by the hall resistivity measurements , an unconventional behavior , being distinct from the spin - orbit - coupling induced ahe , has been found in phases i and ii . although the complex spin structures of phases i@xmath41iii were interconnected to a proper - screw structure by the neutron diffraction measurements , phases i and ii should have long - period and higher hierarchy order of helical spin modulations , albeit to be elucidated by further study . on the verge of phase ii close to the multicritical point shared by phases iii and v , we have found the clear imprint of the emergence of a topological spin texture in the hall resistivity behavior .",
    "this marginal stability is analogous to the skyrmion crystal phase in the b20-type compound which is surrounded by the first - order phase boundaries shared by the conical and the paramagnetic phases @xcite .",
    "the high-@xmath14 phases iv and v are expected to have conical spin structure , and the enhanced thermal spin fluctuation has been suggested for the higher-@xmath42 phases iii and v. the rich phase diagram in srfeo@xmath0 reflects the highly symmetric , cubic lattice hosting the magnetically degenerated phases ; this may lead to the emergence of higher - hierarchy topological spin textures as manifested by the topological hall effect .",
