    "despite the intensive research efforts developed over the past six years , the remarkable results of the torsional - oscillator ( to ) experiments on solid @xmath0he by kim and chan  @xcite still elude a consistent explanation .",
    "although it has been suggested that the observed nonclassical rotational inertia ( ncri ) is a manifestation of superfluidity in the solid phase ,  @xcite several questions remain unanswered .",
    "one of them is the apparent correlation between the ncri data and the observation of elastic stiffening upon cooling , both of which display similar temperature and @xmath2he - concentration dependences  @xcite .",
    "the observed stiffening effect has been interpreted in terms of dislocation pinning due to @xmath2he impurities  @xcite and this has contributed to ideas that the ncri may not have an exclusive non - superfluid origin but rather that it might also be a manifestation of mechanical behaviour  @xcite .",
    "a major difficulty is the fact that the insight obtained from recent experiments  @xcite relies on the indirect interpretation of data , a process that is inevitably based on assumptions .",
    "the dislocation - pinning interpretation , for instance , conjectures the presence of dislocation networks that are pinned by @xmath2he impurities binding to the dislocation cores  @xcite . despite the elevated degree of sophistication of recent experiments  @xcite ,",
    "however , it has not yet been possible to verify these assumptions explicitly , hampering a conclusive understanding of the observed phenomenology and its relation to the ncri data obtained in to experiments .    in this context",
    ", theoretical modelling can serve as a useful complementary approach . in principle",
    ", it allows a systematic study of a hierarchy of well - controlled structures not accessible to experiment , starting at the defect - free crystal and progressing through a series of configurations containing different defect geometries .",
    "analysis of the results obtained in these different situations may then assist in the interpretation of existing experimental data or even lead to new predictions .",
    "however , a first step in this effort is to gauge the results of these modelling approaches for quantities that can be directly compared to experimental data . in the context of the recent observations of the mechanical behaviour of solid @xmath0he , its intrinsic elastic properties are an evident target for such an assessment .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to compare the results of state - of - the - art path - integral monte carlo  @xcite ( pimc ) calculations based on the aziz pair potential  @xcite to the available experimental data for the elastic stiffness constants from the 1970s .",
    "the pimc method has shown to give excellent agreement with experiment for several properties of the liquid and solid states , including the energy , pair correlation functions , structure factors , and superfluid density . triggered by to experiments of kim and chan , the pimc methodology has also been applied extensively to the study of @xmath0he supersolidity , focusing on a variety of properties , including the possibility of superflow induced by lattice defects such as vacancies  @xcite and dislocations  @xcite .",
    "the first path - integral approach to the computation of elastic constants was based on a direct measurement of the elastic constants in terms of the second derivatives of the partition function with respect to strain components  @xcite .",
    "here we adopt a different approach based on the development of an expression for the stress - tensor observable in the path integral formalism .",
    "not only does this observable allow the determination of the elastic constants of the defect - free crystal , it is also a key observable in the characterization of plastic deformation in terms of lattice defect properties . in this light , this development is of interest in its own right , allowing for instance , an explicit atomistic determination of the peierls stress for dislocation motion  @xcite .",
    "here we utilize it to compute the complete set of stress - strain relations by measuring the elastic stress response to small homogeneous deformations , giving the five independent elastic stiffness constants of the hcp @xmath0he crystal .",
    "in addition to a direct comparison of elastic constants as a function of density , we analyze the degree to which the cauchy relation , which measures to what extent non central forces and zero - point effects are important , is satisfied .",
    "the remainder of the paper has been organized as follows . in sec .",

    "interestingly , the vmc result for @xmath91 is actually in good agreement with experiment , differing by @xmath11210% . to investigate the origin of this discrepancy , it is useful to verify whether certain relations , different from those associated with the crystal symmetry , hold .",
    "one of these is the relation    @xmath113    which should be satisfied in case the @xmath114 ratio is independent of the density .",

    "another concerns the validity of the so - called cauchy relation  @xcite , @xmath115 , where @xmath31 is the applied hydrostatic pressure .",
    "these are relations between elastic constants that are expected to hold when the ( a ) interatomic interactions can be described by purely two - body central forces and ( b ) when vibrational effects , zero - point or thermal in origin , are negligible .",
    "it is useful to quantify deviations from this relation through the parameter  @xcite    @xmath116    for a classical crystal at @xmath117k and characterized by pairwise central interaction forces one has @xmath118 .",
    "deviations from this value are then a measure of the magnitude of vibrational effects and the importance of many - body interaction forces . in the case of quantum crystals at low temperatures ,",
    "the deviation thus is a probe for the role of zero - point motion and/or many body interactions .",
    "it seems plausible , however , that the latter are rather small for the condensed phases @xmath0he  @xcite .",
    "[ [ fig3 ] ] shows @xmath119 as a function of the density for the experimental data and our pimc results for the hcp phase .",
    "the results show a distinct discrepancy .",
    "while the calculations give relatively small deviation values , ranging between 0.05 and 0.14 , the experimental deviations are 0.8 - 0.9 .",
    "again , this discrepancy can be traced back to the difference in the value of stiffness constant @xmath91 .        to further assess these issues we also computed the elastic constants for the bcc phase , which exists at similar densities and temperatures as those considered for the hcp form . in this case",
    ", we find very good agreement between pimc and experiment for _ all _ elastic constants .",
    "specifically , at a density of 21 cm@xmath2 and a temperature of 1.5 @xmath36 , the pimc calculations give @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and @xmath122 bar .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering measurements , on the other hand , give @xmath123 , @xmath124 , and @xmath125 bar so that the differences between pimc and experiment are less than 10% for all stiffness constants . as a result , there are no significant discrepancies between pimc and experimental cauchy deviations , as can be gauged by the parameter @xmath126 in fig .  [",
    "[ fig3 ] ] .",
    "the interpretation of the above results is challenging . in the present situation",
    ", our results agree very well with experiment for four of the five independent elastic moduli of the hcp phase , but show a deviation for the remaining constant , @xmath91 .",
    "if this were to be interpreted as a flaw in our calculations , then discrepancies would also be expected for other phases .",
    "this does not seem to be the case .",
    "in addition to previous results for the liquid phase based on very similar interaction models  @xcite , our calculations are in very good agreement with experiment for all elastic constants of the bcc phase .",
    "a further element in this discussion is that , although conducted for zero temperature , recent vmc and diffusion monte carlo results  @xcite do not seem to show this deviation for @xmath91 in hcp @xmath0he .    to unveil this puzzle",
    "it would be extremely useful to renew the experimental data for the elastic constants of hcp @xmath0he .",
    "the data sets available today are more than 30 years old and , with present experimental capabilities , it should be possible to obtain the elastic constants with significantly greater accuracy .",
    "not only would such data be useful toward gauging current theoretical modeling approaches , they would also be particularly useful , for instance , in understanding the elastic properties of polycrystalline @xmath0he samples  @xcite .",
    "in addition , such information would also be of value in discriminating between changes in elasticity and supersolidity , respectively , when interpreting frequency changes in to experiments  @xcite .",
