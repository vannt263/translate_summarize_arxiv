    "the enumeration of standard young tableaux ( syts ) is a fundamental problem in combinatorics and representation theory .",
    "for example , it is known that the number of syts of a given shape @xmath4 is counted by the hook - length formula  @xcite . however , the problem of counting syts of bounded height is a hard one .",
    "let @xmath5 be the set of syts with @xmath6 entries and at most @xmath7 rows , and let @xmath8 be the @xmath7-rowed strip .",
    "in 1981 , regev proved that @xmath9 in terms of symmetric functions  @xcite .",
    "note that @xmath10 is exactly the motzkin number @xmath11 . in 1989 , together with @xmath12 and @xmath10 , gouyou - beauchamps derived that @xmath13 combinatorially , where @xmath14 is the catalan number  @xcite .",
    "his idea relied on the fact that the number of syts with @xmath6 entries and at most @xmath7 rows equals the number of involutions of @xmath15 $ ] with the length of a longest decreasing subsequence at most @xmath7 , hence it suffices to count these restricted involutions .",
    "these are in fact all the simple formulae we have for @xmath16 so far  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , zeilberger proved that for each @xmath7 the generating function of @xmath16 is always @xmath17-recursive  @xcite .",
    "gessel also pointed out this fact and derived explicitly the exponential generating function of @xmath16 in terms of hyperbolic bessel functions of the first kind  @xcite .",
    "recently regev considered the following variation among others .",
    "given @xmath18 a partition of at most three parts , let @xmath19 and @xmath20 be the set of syts with @xmath21 entries in the `` skew strip '' @xmath22 .",
    "regev conjectured that for @xmath23 , @xmath24 a difference of two motzkin numbers  @xcite .",
    "this conjecture is confirmed by zeilberger by using the wz method  @xcite .",
    "what s more , with his powerful maple package amitai , zeilberger could generate and rigorously prove many similar identities , among them are a list of formulae of @xmath25 for @xmath26 , and the number of syts in @xmath0 with the restriction that the @xmath27 entry is @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "amazingly , each formula is a linear combination of negative shifts of the motzkin numbers with constant coefficients .    in the remark of  @xcite zeilberger then asked that , besides regev s question of finding a combinatorial proof of the @xmath3 conjecture ( now a theorem , after zeilberger ) , is there a uniform way to construct combinatorial proofs to all of these results , or prove that there is no natural bijection because the identities are true ` just because ' .    in this paper",
    "we answer regev and zeilberger s questions affirmatively .",
    "we shall present a simple bijection between @xmath30 and the set of motzkin paths of length @xmath6 , which gives another proof for @xmath31 . with this bijection",
    "we can prove regev s conjecture and consequently all of zeilberger s identities for three - rowed syts combinatorially .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we introduce the bijection in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we give combinatorial proofs to regev s and zeilberger s results . in the last section",
    "we give a conjecture , regarding a relation between @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the @xmath6th motzkin number .",
    "one way to define the motzkin numbers is by their generating function @xmath34 .",
    "this function satisfies the equation @xmath35 one combinatorial interpretation of the motzkin numbers is the motzkin paths .",
    "a _ motzkin path _ of length @xmath6 is a lattice path from @xmath36 to @xmath37 using _ up steps _ @xmath38 , _ down steps _ @xmath39 , and _ level steps _ @xmath40 that never go below the @xmath41-axis .",

    "yamanouchi words_. for example , @xmath49 on the other hand , given a yamanouchi word @xmath50 , it is straightforward to recover the corresponding tableau @xmath51 , i.e. , the @xmath52th row of which contains the indices of the letters of @xmath50 that are equal to @xmath52 .",
    "now we present a bijection @xmath53 between motzkin paths and the tableaux of @xmath30 in terms of yamanouchi words .",

    "if @xmath61 starts with a level step then we label the first step by @xmath63 .",

    "form a new path @xmath70 from @xmath61 by removing those labeled steps and concatenating the remaining segments of steps . if @xmath70 is empty then we are done , otherwise go to ( a1 ) and proceed to process @xmath70 .",
    "reading the labels of @xmath71 in order , we obtain the requested word @xmath62 .",
    "note that each step with the label 2 is preceded by a matching step with the label 1 , and whenever a step is labeled by 3 there is a matching pair of steps with labels 1 and 2 .",
