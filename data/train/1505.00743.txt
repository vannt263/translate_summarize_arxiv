    "in classical field theory , a basic question is whether it is possible to introduce a consistent extension of general relativity for massive graviton , or not .",
    "in fact , a small graviton mass may have significant physical interest , notably , for the cosmological constant problem .",
    "an attempt for a covariant theory was initiated long back in 1939 by fierz and pauli ( fp ) @xcite .",
    "they introduced a quadratic mass term @xmath0 for linear gravitational perturbation @xmath1 to the action , and , as a result , there is a violation of gauge invariance in general relativity .",
    "also , the linear theory with fp - mass does not recover general relativity in the massless limit @xmath2 , a contradiction with solar system test due to the van dam  veltman ",
    "zakharov ( vdvz ) discontinuity @xcite .",
    "this discontinuity can be overcome by introducing nonlinear interactions with the help of vainshtein mechanism @xcite .",
    "but elimination of vdvz potential led inevitably to the existence of boulware  deser ( bd)-ghost @xcite , and , as a result , the theory becomes unstable @xcite .",
    "+ then after a long gap , very recently , a two parameter family of nonlinear generalization of the fp theory was formulated by de rham , gabadadze and tolley ( drgt ) @xcite .",
    "this model of massive gravity is in the context of extra dimensions , and it modifies general relativity at the cosmological scale . here , the bd ghosts are eliminated in the decoupling limit to all orders in perturbation by constructing a covariant nonlinear action @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) , and is free from tames issues which have plagued earlier attempts at a given mass to the graviton . in the context of studying the nature of perturbations on the given backgrounds , fasiello and",
    "tolley @xcite have investigated the higuchi bound for classical stability of drgt theory with the flrw reference metric , and , in contrast to earlier investigations @xcite , it is found that the bound is independent of the precise form of matter .",
    "also , it has been shown @xcite that the free parameters do not change the qualitative picture of the higuchi - vainshtein analysis except for a specific cosmological epoch .",
    "furthermore , it is found that the higuchi - vainshtein tension can not be relaxed in the parameters space for stability of the drgt theory if both the reference and the dynamical metrics are flrw , i.e. , the cosmological solutions ( in massive gravity ) with a general flrw reference metric are not phenomenologically viable due to the tension with an operative vainshtein mechanism @xcite .",
    "+ at present , there are wide classes of applications of drgt theory , particularly , in cosmology @xcite , in black holes , and , in spherically symmetric solutions @xcite and its relation with bimetric gravity @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "various cosmological aspects have been studied in the perspective of the massive gravity theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii deals with basic equations in massive gravity theory .",
    "deceleration parameter has been evaluated , and possible transitions have been studied in section iii .",
    "section iv discusses on the equivalence of massive gravity and einstein gravity . in section",
    "v , we proposed an emergent scenario .",
    "section vi is devoted for a detail cosmographical analysis . finally , in section vii ,",
    "we have briefly discussed our results .",
    "massive gravity theory has an effective field theoretic prescription given by einstein gravity together with the covariant fp mass term . in drgt model ,",
    "the action is a functional of the metric @xmath3 and four spurious scalar fields @xmath4 , which are introduced to give a manifestly diffeomorphism invariant description @xcite .",
    "one defines a covariant tensor @xmath5 as :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 , the usual minkowskian metric is defined in the co - ordinate system defined by @xmath8 s .",
    "so , gravity in this formulation is described by the tensor @xmath5 propagating on minkowski s space . in the unitary gauge ,",
    "all the four scalars @xmath9 are frozen , and , equal to the corresponding space - time co - ordinates @xmath10 .",
    "however , sometimes , it may be helpful to use a non - unitary gauge in which @xmath11 s are allowed to fluctuate .",

    "now , for convenience , if we choose the unitary gauge @xmath10 , then the metric tensor @xmath28 stands for the observable describing the 5 degrees of freedom of the massive graviton .",
    "the line element for friedmann  lematre  robertson  walker ( flrw ) geometry of arbitrary spatial curvature is given by    @xmath29    with spatial metric @xmath30 in terms of spherical co - ordinates as    @xmath31    where @xmath32 , or @xmath33 refers to flat , closed , or , open models of the universe respectively .",
    "+ in the present work , we choose the reference metric @xmath26 as the de sitter metric .",
    "the reason behind this choice in contrast to the usual minkowski metric is that one can easily be able to formulate the flat , open , or , closed cosmologies by suitable slicing of the de sitter model .",
    "also , this choice of reference metric eliminates the problem of ` no - go ' theorem @xcite .",
    "the metric in this model can be written as    @xmath34    with    @xmath35    it should be mentioned that in the limit , @xmath36 , one recovers minkowski s metric for flat and open cases :",
    "@xmath37 , while the later case corresponds to the milne metric for flat geometry .",

    "( [ eqn24 ] ) , provided , @xmath52 is invertible .",
    "it should be noted that , in case of minkowski s reference metric ( i.e. , @xmath53 ) , we have @xmath54 for flat case , and hence , there is no longer any solution , while , for open case ( where @xmath55 ) , there are two branches of solutions . on the other hand , from the remaining part of eq .",
    "( [ eqn23 ] ) , we have    @xmath56    and as before , non - trivial solutions are possible , only if ` @xmath57 ' is an invertible function . in this case , there is no analog of minkowskian reference metric ( as there exists no solution for both flat and open cases ) .",

    "( [ eqn13 ] ) , ( [ eqn14 ] ) , and ( [ eqn15 ] ) , it is possible to have an explicit solution for @xmath48 . in particular , for flat case ( i.e. , @xmath59 ) ( also assuming , @xmath60 ) we have    @xmath61    where @xmath62 is the hubble rate of the flrw metric , and @xmath63 that of the reference metric ( here , de sitter metric ) .",

    "1 shows the graphical representation of @xmath88 over the hubble parameter ( @xmath62 ) for the mentioned set of parameters in the graph .",
    "we also mention that , for two very very small values of the graviton mass @xmath89 ( dashed line ) , and @xmath90 ( dotted line ) , the graphs overlap with one another , and even for @xmath91 , we can not distinguish between two graphs .",

    "the right and left tails of the curves indicate the inflationary and the late - time accelerating phase of the universe , while , the matter dominated era corresponds to the middle portion of the graph , where @xmath93 .",
    "moreover , from the graph , we see that , if the graviton mass ( @xmath14 ) is very very small , then the model approaches @xmath94cdm , however , if @xmath14 increases , then the null energy condition is violated at late - times , and this may be potentially problematic for the stability of the theory . as the reference metric is de sitter , and @xmath63 corresponds to its hubble rate , so , @xmath63 would define where inflation may occur .",
    "however , in the present graphs , the chosen value of @xmath95 falls into the matter dominated era .",
    "in the previous section , we have presented effective friedmann equations in massive gravity theory containing three free parameters . here , we start with restricting the free parameters @xmath17 , @xmath18 , such that , @xmath96 . as a result , we have @xmath97 , @xmath98 , thus , we have @xmath99 , and @xmath100 .",

    "( [ eqn44 ] ) and ( [ eqn45 ] ) are nothing but usual friedmann s equations in einstein gravity with a negative cosmological constant which depends on the graviton mass , and also , the newtonian gravitational constant is modified by the free parameter @xmath14 .",

    "briefly , emergent universe is a model universe having no time - like singularity , ever existing and almost static behavior in the infinite past ( t@xmath143 @xmath144 ) .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that , in 1988 , brandenberger and vafa @xcite showed that in the context of superstring theory , a simple model can resolve this big bang singularity .",

    "lastly , the cosmographic analysis has been done for this present gravity theory .    the cosmological solution for perfect fluid with constant equation of state shows a periodic nature of the scale factor which may be interpreted as the possibility of a cyclic universe in massive gravity theory .",
    "this feature is also supported by the divergence of the ricci scalar at infinite number of points .",
