    "let us note that compared to the hubbard model for d - electron systems the kinks of the pam are located at much lower energies ( by about one order of magnitude ) .",
    "this stems from the very small quasiparticle renormalization @xmath70 , which is not surprising , since the interaction strength is more enhanced in f - systems due to the confinement of electrons in the very narrow f - orbitals .      after finding kinks in the real part of the pam self energy ,",

    "these two dominant features hide a more delicate kink feature which according to eq .",

    "we have identified kinks in the real part of the self energy of the periodic anderson model , the arguably simplest model for f - electrons systems .",
    "the hybridization gap leads to an additional feature , in our case at @xmath61 , making the clear identification of the kink more difficult than for the hubbard model .",
    "the kink frequency follows the same exponential dependence on the hybridization strength as the kondo temperature .",
    "in contrast to the hubbard model , the kink is difficult to detect visibly in the energy - momentum dispersion since the non - interacting energy - momentum dispersion has a strong curvature around the kink energy .",
    "similarly , also in the specific heat , the fingerprint of the self - energy kink is less obvious because a stronger feature , associated with the hybridization gap , is superimposed .",
