    "shear bands are narrow zones of intense shear observed during the dynamic deformation of many metals at high strain rates .",
    "shear localization forms a striking instance of material instability , often preceding rupture , and its study has attracted considerable attention in the mechanics _ e.g.",
    "_  @xcite , numerical @xcite , or mathematical literature @xcite . in experimental investigations of high strain - rate deformations of steels , observations of shear bands",
    "are typically associated with strain softening response  past a critical strain  of the measured stress - strain curve @xcite .",
    "it was proposed by zener and hollomon @xcite , and further precised by clifton et al @xcite , that the effect of the deformation speed is twofold : an increase in the deformation speed changes the deformation conditions from isothermal to nearly adiabatic , and the combined effect of thermal softening and strain hardening of metals may produce a net softening response .",
    "on the other hand , strain - rate hardening has an effect _ per se _ , inducing momentum diffusion and playing a stabilizing role .",
    "strain softening has a destabilizing effect ; it is known at the level of simple models ( _ e.g. _ wu and freund @xcite ) to induce _ hadamard instability _ - an ill - posedness of a linearized problem .",
    "it should however be remarked that , while hadamard instability indicates the catastrophic growth of oscillations around a mean state , what is observed in localization is the orderly albeit extremely fast development of coherent structures , the shear bands . despite considerable attention to the problem of localization ,",
    "little is known about the initial formation of shear bands , due to the dominance of nonlinear effects from the early instances of localization .",
    "our aim is to study the onset of localization for a simple model , lying at the core of various theories for shear band formation , @xmath0 which will serve to assess the effects of strain softening @xmath1 and strain - rate sensitivity @xmath2 and analyze the emergence of a shear band out of the competition of hadamard instability and strain - rate hardening .",
    "the model describes shear deformations of a viscoplastic material in the @xmath3-plane , with @xmath4 the velocity in the @xmath5-direction , @xmath6 the plastic shear strain ( elastic effects are neglected ) , and the material is obeying a viscoplastic constitutive law of power law type , @xmath7 the constitutive law can be thought as describing a plastic flow rule on the yield surface .",
    "the model captures the bare essentials of the localization mechanism proposed in @xcite .",

    "this was addressed by fressengeas - molinari @xcite and molinari - clifton @xcite who introduced the study of relative perturbations , namely to assess the stability of the ratios of the perturbation relative to the base time - dependent solution , and provided linearized stability results . such linearized stability and instability results compared well with studies of nonlinear stability ( _ e.g _ @xcite or @xcite for a survey ) .    here , we restrict to the constitutive function @xmath14 in but retain the dependence in @xmath15 , and study @xmath16 this model has a special and quite appealing property : after considering a transformation to relative perturbations and a rescaling of variables , @xmath17 the problem of stability of the time - dependent uniform shearing solution is transformed into the problem of stability of the equilibrium @xmath18 for the nonlinear but _ autonomous _ parabolic system @xmath19    the following heuristic argument leads to a conjecture regarding the effect of rate sensitivity @xmath15 on the dynamics : as time proceeds the second equation in , which is of relaxation type , relaxes to the equilibrium manifold @xmath20 . accordingly ,",

    "the argument is proposed in @xcite in connection to the development of an asymptotic criterion for the quantitative assessment of shear band formation and can be quantified by means of an asymptotic expansion ( see section [ sec : coarse_scale ] ) .    in this article",
    "we study the dynamics of the system .",

    "for the remainder of this work we focus on the particular choice of @xmath62 , namely @xmath63 the reason for this restriction is the following : the uniform shearing solutions are time - dependent and their analysis ( linearization and nonlinear analysis ) leads very quickly to issues with non - autonomous problems .",
