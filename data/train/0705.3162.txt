    ", in counting the number of quantifiers , one counts every individual quantifier , not just alternations of quantifiers .",
    "this inspired me to investigate the 4- and 5-quantifier sentences , and in particular i set out to disprove the conjecture that there is nt a 5-quantifier @xmath0-sentence equivalent to the axiom of choice .",
    "i succeeded and this paper presents the proof .",
    "a draft version of this result was checked by norman megill with metamath , a system for computer - aided formal proof checking developed by norman megill .",
    "all this poses the next question : `` can @xmath2 be stated by an @xmath0-sentence with only 4 quantifiers ? '' .",
    "i personally believe this is nt possible .",
    "this believe comes from the fact that all known ( to me ) sentences zf - equivalent to @xmath2 have a form like @xmath4 .",
    "the dots allow for some premises which must be satisfied by @xmath5 and @xmath6 must , in some way , express that @xmath7 represents a maximal decision relative to @xmath5 .",
    "usually this @xmath8 ca nt be stated with 2 or less quantifiers . the only exception i am aware of is a reworked version of zorn s lemma .",
    "but in this case the premises on @xmath5 become quantifier - loaded .    in section 2 ,",
    "i introduce the notion of choice - sets and prove that `` @xmath7 is a choice - set for @xmath5 '' can be stated with a well - formed - formula ( wff ) in the primitive language of set - theory containing only 3 quantifiers .",
    "in particular this wff belongs to the complexity class @xmath9 .    in section 3 ,",
    "i state the axiom of choice , @xmath2 , in terms of choice - sets .",
    "furthermore , i introduce a new `` stronger '' statement @xmath10 , which is stronger in the sense that only first order predicate calculus is required to prove that @xmath10 implies @xmath2 .",
    "this is possible since @xmath10 exhibits a weaker hypothesis and a stronger conclusion then @xmath2 .",
    "following this , i show that this new statement is implied by @xmath2 in a weak fragment of zf . namely the following :    extensionality",

    "2 .   if @xmath7 is a choice - set for @xmath19 , then we can construct a choice - set from this set for @xmath5 which is not contained in @xmath5 .",
    "in section 4 , i rewrite @xmath10 to obtain @xmath1 , which is a 5-quantifier @xmath0-sentence .",
    "the proof of their equivalence only involves first order predicate calculus without any of the axioms of zf set theory .",
    "we call a set @xmath7 a choice - set for a set @xmath5 , and write @xmath20 , if for any non - empty element , @xmath21 , the intersection of @xmath22 and @xmath7 , @xmath23 , is a singleton .",

    "now take any @xmath30 . since      we have @xmath39 , we definitely have      @xmath41 .",

    "since @xmath30 was chosen arbitrarily , our chosen    @xmath29 also satisfies @xmath40 .",
    "this    concludes the proof .",

    "+    @xmath32 clearly states : if @xmath22 is non - empty , then the intersection between @xmath22 and @xmath7 is a singleton . while @xmath33 shows that this can be said with only two quantifiers .",
    "more in particular we may conclude that @xmath20 is equivalent to @xmath58 hence `` @xmath7 is a choice - set for @xmath5 '' can be stated in @xmath0-notation with as little as 3 quantifiers .",
    "one of the formulations of the axiom of choice , @xmath2 , states : + _ for any set @xmath5 consisting of non - empty pairwise disjoint elements , there exists a choice - set @xmath7 for @xmath5 . _",
