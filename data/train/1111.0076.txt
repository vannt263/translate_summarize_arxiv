    "in the last years , the extended hubbard model ( ehm ) was introduced to explain some interesting phenomena including metal - insulator transition mott1,mott2,mott3,mott4,mott5 , antiferromagnetism sanna , nie , antif3,antij , and high-@xmath6 superconductivity mc , supra2,halb .",
    "this ehm is a standard simple model of interacting itinerant electrons in a solid @xcite .",
    "although this model is too idealized to be regarded as a quantitatively reliable model of real solids , it contains physically essential features of interacting itinerant electron systems . despite being one of the most studied models to describe strongly correlated electrons system , many questions concerning the hubbard model remain as open problems .",
    "in applied , we have applied the self consistent random phase approximation ( scrpa ) @xcite to solve the ehm in @xmath7 , where , we have shown that this approach treat the correlations of closed chains with a rigours manner .",
    "the behaviour of our scrpa ground state and gap energies shows that the repulsive off - site interaction between the electrons of the neighbouring atoms induces supplementary conductivity , since , the scrpa energy gap vanishes when the closed chains of the ehm are governed by a strong repulsive on - site and an intermediate repulsive off - site interactions .",
    "but , due to the restricted motion along one direction in space , the hubbard model chain does nt exhibit any ferromagnetic feature .",
    "thus , the @xmath7 hubbard is a nice prototype to describe , only , the @xmath7 classical conductors .",
    "stimulated by the discovery of high-@xmath6 superconductivity in the cuprate plans , the @xmath8 hubbard model have attracted a great attention in the recent two decades @xcite . in spite of its simple description in square lattice ,",
    "it is not obvious to solve the 2d hubbard model in the general case .",
    "the exact solution of @xmath8 hubbard model is not still reached , but , a great variety of approximate treatments have been proposed @xcite .    very recently , e. kovacs et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an exact solution of the usual hubbard model for @xmath9 cluster with low concentration , where each cluster presents four electrons .",
    "the dynamics of these electrons is described by the usual kinetic of electrons with hopping energy @xmath10 and the repulsive on - site interaction between electrons in the same site with interaction energy @xmath0 .    in the present paper , we purpose to apply this method to an extended hubbard model which takes into account the off - site interaction with an interaction energy @xmath1    this paper is organized as follows . in sec.2 , we present the model and the calculation procedure which allows us to construct the hamiltonian matrix of dimension @xmath5 . in sec.3 , we present our results for ground state and gap energies and discuss the effect of the off - site interaction on the dynamics of system . finally , in sec.4 we give our conclusions .",
    "the two - dimensional extended hubbard model on a square lattice is given by:@xmath11    where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the creation ( annihilation ) operators for a fermion of spin @xmath14 at site @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "thus , @xmath10 is the hopping term from the site @xmath16 to the site @xmath15 , where @xmath17 sums over nearest neighbour sites .",
    "the second term describes the local repulsive interaction with parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the last term takes into account the nearest - neighbour repulsion between electrons with energy @xmath1 .",
    "the resolution of the model ( @xmath18 ) in case of finite size system , gives the exact solution of some physical quantities as the ground state energy , the energy gap and the occupation numbers .",
    "we consider , thus , a two dimensional @xmath19 square lattice at one - eighth filling ( four electrons per cluster ) , with periodic boundary conditions in both directions .",
    "for this considered system , three types of particle configurations may occur .",
    "first , we can have two double occupancies at sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "second , we may have a double occupancy at site @xmath15 and two electrons with opposite spins at sites @xmath16 and @xmath21 ( @xmath20 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) . finally , we may have four single occupancies placed on different sites of this @xmath24 square lattice .",
    "these three possible configurations provide , respectively , the three states :    @xmath25    @xmath26    @xmath27    where @xmath28 represents the state vacuum with no electron present .",
    "the states @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 generate @xmath32 states , which describe all possible distributions of our four electrons in the @xmath2 cluster . in order to construct a @xmath3 basis , it is convient to define a linear operator @xmath33 @xcite , which verifies the relation :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the particle configurations as mentioned in fig . 1 , @xmath37 is the linear combination of the @xmath38 contributions obtained by the translation of the configuration @xmath35 to each site of the @xmath2 cluster .",
    "using this linear operator and taking into account the symmetry proprieties of the @xmath2 cluster in @xmath3 representation , we can regroup these @xmath39 states in @xmath4 cluster states denoted by @xmath40 , where @xmath41 , and are all orthogonal vectors .",
    "for example , @xmath42 is the linear combination of all states @xmath29 with @xmath43 , where @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) is the lattice position of the site @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath46 is the square lattice parameter .",
    "@xmath47 is the linear combination of all states @xmath30 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 . whereas @xmath50 is ,",
    "also , the linear combination of all states @xmath30 with @xmath51 but @xmath52  ( for the definition of the other 82 vectors , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the application of the hamiltonian @xmath53 on the basis vector @xmath54 gives :    @xmath55    it is clear that the hamiltonian would not be diagonal in our @xmath3 basis , since the application of the kinetic term @xmath56 on a vector @xmath57 gives , always , the new states @xmath58 after the creation and the annihilation of electrons in the different lattice sites .",
    "thus , it is necessary to define the matrix energy @xmath59 as :    @xmath60    where @xmath40 and @xmath61 are two vectors of the @xmath3 basis . in order to study the local properties of the @xmath2 square lattice ,",
    "it is appropriate to determine , numerically , the eigenvalues and the eigenvectors of the matrix energy @xmath59 .",
    "we consider the obtained first and second minimums of the eigenvalues as , respectively , the ground state and the first excited energies .",
    "first , we disregarded the off - site interaction , and we have plotted in fig.2  and fig.3 the ground state and the first excited state energies , respectively , as function of the on - site interaction energy @xmath0 .",
    "the corresponding curves of this case @xmath62 show that the ground state energy has smooth ( less than linear ) @xmath0 dependence , whereas the first excited state energy is @xmath0 independent and fixed at @xmath63 for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , it is clear that the first excited state is an eigenvector of the kinetic energy @xmath64 , since this excited state avoid totally the double occupancy . whereas , the ground state is not eigenstate of the kinetic energy or the on - site interacting part of @xmath65 only , but is eigenvector for the sum of both .",
    "thus , at the ground state , the dynamics of the electrons system is governed by a competition between the habitual kinetic and the on - site interaction .",
    "then , we have taken into account the off - site interaction @xmath66 and we have plotted in in the same previous figures ( fig.2  and fig.3 ) the ground state and the first excited state energies , respectively , as function of the on - site interaction energy @xmath0 for two values of @xmath67 .    the fig .",
    "2 shows that the energy @xmath68 has a smooth @xmath0 dependence and a linear @xmath1 dependence .",
    "this behaviour is similar to the one obtained for the ground state energy of the chains extended hubbard model with the self consistent random phase approximation ( scrpa ) @xcite , where we have also , defined the matrix energy but in the basis of vectors impulsion - space ( @xmath69 ) and not in @xmath3 representation .",
    "the curves of fig . 2 show , also , that @xmath68 decreases with @xmath1 for a fixed value of @xmath0 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that this off - site interaction imposes the electron system to avoid partially the double occupancy in this ground state .",
    "3 shows that the first exited state energy becomes @xmath0 dependent for @xmath70 .",
    "thus , the off - site interaction encourages the existence of the double occupancies in this exited state . for a weak off - site interaction ( @xmath71 )",
    ", the corresponding curve shows that @xmath72 becomes @xmath0 independent for the high values of @xmath0 .",
    "but for an intermediate off - site interaction ( @xmath73 ) , @xmath72 still remains dependent @xmath0 ; since , we have the opportunity to have the double occupancies even for high values of @xmath0 .    in order to analyze the on - site and off - site interactions effects on the repartition of our four electrons in the above system",
    ", we define the double occupancy coefficient in the first exited state @xmath74 as the probability to have a couple of electrons @xmath75 on the same site in this exited state ,    @xmath76    where the sum over all @xmath2 cluster sites and the mean values @xmath77 are taken in the corresponding eigenvector to @xmath72 .",
    "the double occupancy coefficient @xmath74 in the first exited state is shown in fig.4 as function of @xmath78 for different values of @xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 .",
    "thus , effectively , our system avoids completely the double occupancy at this exited state .",
    "but , after taking into account the off - site interaction , we have @xmath81 . for @xmath73 , we have @xmath81 even for the strong values of @xmath78 .",
    "but , for @xmath82 , the coefficient @xmath74 vanishes for the strong value of @xmath78 , where the off - site interaction becomes very weak before the on - site interaction .",
    "thus , the behaviour of our system in this regime ( @xmath83 ) is similar to the one found in ref .",
    "@xcite . where the authors have shown that @xmath84 of the excited states of the @xmath2 cluster are @xmath0 independent .",
    "but , it is clear that the number of this @xmath0 independent exited states decreases if we take into account the off - site interaction , since this interaction encourage the formation of the double occupancies in the exited states .",
    "finally , in order to analyze the effect of the off - site interaction on the dynamics of electrons , we define the energy gap @xmath85 as the difference between the first excited state energy @xmath72 and the ground state energy @xmath68    @xmath86    in fig . 5",
    ", we plot the variation of this energy gap @xmath85 as function of the repulsive on - site interaction energy @xmath0 for different values of the off - site interaction energy @xmath1 .    for a fixed value of @xmath67",
    ", the energy gap decreases with @xmath0 .",
    "we deduce that the repulsive on - site interaction ( @xmath87 ) increases the conductivity of the system , since the repulsion between the two electrons of the same site encourages every electron to jump to the neighbouring site .",
    "moreover , this curves show that the off- site interaction increases also the conductivity of this @xmath2 cluster . for a weak off - site interaction ( @xmath88 ) ,",
    "the effect of @xmath1 is remarkable only for the weak on - site interaction whereas it becomes practically non - existent for strong on - site interaction .",
    "but , for an intermediate off - site interaction ( @xmath73 ) , the effect remains remarkable even for the strong values of @xmath78 .",
    "thus , we can conclude that with a strong on - site and an intermediate off - site interactions , our @xmath2 cluster have an important conductivity .",
    "in this paper , an exact diagonalization in the @xmath3 was proposed to solve the two dimensional extended hubbard model for finite size system . in particular , we have considered a two dimensional @xmath19 square lattice at one - eighth filling with respecting the periodic boundary conditions in both directions .    first , the numeric diagonalization of our hamiltonian matrix allow us to determine some interesting local properties of our @xmath2 square lattice as : the ground state energy @xmath89 , the first excited state energy @xmath72 , the gap energie @xmath85 and the double occupation number per site @xmath74 .",
    "then , the analysis of the behaviours of these obtained local properties as function of @xmath0 and @xmath1 allows as to study the distribution and the dynamics of  the elctrons system in two interesting states : ground and first exited states .",
    "thus , we have found that our system has always the double occupancies in the ground state for any value of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in the first exited state",
    ", we have shown that the off - site site interaction encourages the electrons system to form the double occupancies , where the coefficient @xmath74 vanishes for @xmath90 .",
    "whereas , for an intermediate off - site interaction , we found that we have always the probability to have these double occupancies .",
    "but , this probability vanishes for strong on - site and weak off - site interactions , where , the electrons system avoids completely the double occupancy .",
    "thus , the behaviour of our system in this regime ( @xmath91 ) is similar to the one found in ref .",
    "finally , the analysis of the off - site interaction effect on the energy gap shows that the repulsive off - site interaction induces supplementary conductivity of the system , where , this effect of @xmath1 is more remarkable for an intermediate off - site interaction , since we have a reduction of order @xmath92 in this regime ."
