    "in 1954 , dicke demonstrated that a system of @xmath0 inverted two - level atoms interacting with an electromagnetic field can spontaneously drop to a ground state during the time proportional to @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "this drop is accompanied by the emission of an electromagnetic - radiation pulse with the peak power @xmath2 proportional to @xmath3 and is called the collective spontaneous emission , or superradiance @xcite .    in the classical limit ,",
    "dicke derived a formula for time dependence of the power @xmath2 for two - level atom systems whose dimensions are much less than the radiation wavelength . in @xcite ,",
    "this formula was generalized to the case of extended systems , but the suggested theories  except for the one given in @xcite and discussing single - mode generation  fall short to describe the initial stage of dicke superradiant emission in a many - atom system .",
    "moreover , the question remains as to the effect of thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field on superradiance .",
    "it is well known @xcite that thermal fluctuations become essential if @xmath4 ; in fact , when @xmath5 , generation starts as a stimulated emission induced by thermal quanta rather than as a spontaneous one .    in this context ,",
    "our paper frames the quantum theory of superradiance startup in the presence of thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , with the zeroth - order magnus approximation @xcite we find the expression for the mean number of photons , @xmath6 , emitted by the system of two - level atoms at the onset of the generation process at finite temperatures .",
    "we shall then demonstrate that under the conditions of a single - mode generation in the absence of thermal fluctuations , the formula for @xmath6 converts to the expression derived by bonifacio and preparata @xcite .",
    "let us consider the emission processes involving a system of two - level atoms . in the interaction representation ,",
    "the hamiltonian of the system has the form @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the creation and annihilation operators of a photon with the energy @xmath10 at the initial time .",
    "generally noncommuting operators @xmath11 depend on time and dynamical operators characterizing the behavior of atoms . using  ( [ interaction1 ] ) ,",
    "we can easily write a formal expression for the evolution operator @xmath12 in the form suggested by magnus @xcite @xmath13+ ... \\big).\\ ] ]    let us mention that the zeroth - order magnus approximation was used by becker and mciver @xcite , where they analyzed the photon statistics in cherenkov oscillators and free electron lasers ( the hamiltinian used in @xcite has the same form as in  ( [ interaction1 ] ) ) : @xmath14 the operators @xmath15 in @xcite were assumed to be @xmath16-numbers .",
    "this only provided the description of spontaneous radiation of relativistic electrons , neglecting the recoil effect .",
    "naturally , the statistics of the emitted photons in this case is poissonian , because @xmath17 at @xmath18 , @xmath19=0 $ ] corresponds to the shift transformation responsible for a vacuum - to - glauber state transformation @xcite .",
    "now , let us return to our problem . in the case under consideration ,",
    "the rate of energy exchange between the atoms and the field is noticeably less than the characteristic oscillation frequencies @xmath20 of the field .",
    "for this reason , the application of the zeroth - order magnus approximation seems justified .",
    "the fact that the operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 are noncommuting is essential , because it is just for this noncommutativity that the radiation is enhanced , which we shall demonstrate further in this paper .    the time evolution of the annihilation operator  @xmath23 in the zeroth - order magnus approximation is given by @xmath24+\\frac{1}{2!}[\\hat a,[\\hat a,\\hat a_\\mu(0)]]+\\frac{1}{3!}[\\hat a,[\\hat a,[\\hat a,\\hat a_\\mu(0)]]]+ ... ,\\nonumber\\\\ & \\hat a=-\\hat a_\\mu^+\\hat",
    "\\alpha_\\mu(t)+\\hat a_\\mu\\hat \\alpha_\\mu^+(t).\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we shall approximately consider the commutators @xmath25\\approx tr\\big([\\hat \\alpha_\\mu^{+}(t),\\hat \\alpha_\\nu(t)]\\big)\\ ] ] to be ordinary numbers , which is true when the quantum - mechanical fluctuations of @xmath26 are negligibly small , and assume the commutators @xmath27 $ ] to be zero .",
    "@xmath28\\approx0.\\ ] ] ( as will be demonstrated further , the relationships ( [ interaction5 ] ) and ( [ interaction6 ] ) strictly hold at the superradiance startup . )",
    "then the operators  @xmath23 readily transform to the form @xmath29    assuming that the electric field at the initial time ( @xmath30 ) was at temperature @xmath31 , we can find the mean number of quanta in the mode with subscript  @xmath32 by formula @xmath33 a remarkable feature of ( [ interaction8 ] ) is that it needs averaging only over the variables characterizing the state of the ensemble of elementary radiators , which can be done using the density matrix @xmath34 of the atomic subsystem . averaging over the field variables",
    "is already completed .",
    "by way of example , we shall consider in detail the startup of superradiance from a system of two - level atoms resonantly interacting with one field mode . in the interaction representation ,",
    "the hamiltonian describing this resonant interaction has the form @xcite @xmath35 where the atomic operators @xmath36 and @xmath37 satisfy the following commutation relations @xcite : @xmath38=\\pm\\hat r_\\pm,\\nonumber\\\\ & [ \\hat r_+,\\hat r_-]=2\\hat r_3.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are the three projections of the pseudo - spin operator , each given by the sum of pauli operators @xmath42 taken over all the atoms ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ superradiance1 ] ) is associated with the following evolution operator @xmath44    using the commutation relations ( [ superradiance2 ] ) , we find the commutators needed for further calculations @xmath45=2\\kappa^*\\kappa\\hat r_3t^2,\\nonumber\\\\ & [ \\hat\\alpha^{(+)},\\hat\\alpha^{(+)}]=0.\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the latter being equal to zero , the condition ( [ interaction6 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "setting @xmath46 and using ( [ interaction8 ] ) , we obtain @xmath47    the operator @xmath48 appearing in ( [ superradiance6 ] ) commutes with @xmath49 , and so @xmath50 is the integral of motion . in a system containing @xmath0 inverted atoms , the eigenvalues of operators @xmath50 and @xmath41 at the superradiance startup equal @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively @xcite . because the system is in a state corresponding to the eigenstate of the operator @xmath41 , the quantum - mechanical fluctuations of @xmath41 vanish , thus supporting the validity of ( [ interaction5 ] ) for a system of two - level atoms .    upon substituting the eigenvalues of the operators @xmath50 and",
    "@xmath41 into ( [ superradiance6 ] ) , it transforms to the form @xmath53 let us note that at @xmath54 , the first term in ( [ superradiance4 ] ) can be neglected , and ( [ superradiance4 ] ) reduces to the expression derived in @xcite . as follows from fig .",
    "1 , which plots @xmath55 against different radiation temperatures , the temperature rise is accompanied by an increase in the number of thermal quanta at @xmath30 .     +    when @xmath5 , generation begins as the emission induced by thermal quanta rather than as a spontaneous emission . as a result ,",
    "the mean number of emitted quanta at the superradiance startup is substantially increased ( fig .",
    "this paper frames the quantum theory of superradiance startup at finite temperatures of the electromagnetic field . in the zeroth - order magnus approximation to the exponential perturbation theory",
    ", we obtained the time dependence of the mean number of emitted photons at the generation startup . in the absence of thermal fluctuations ,",
    "this dependence coincides with that obtained in @xcite . in the reverse case , when @xmath56 , the emission of photons becomes fundamentally different .",
    "actually , when @xmath5 , generation begins as the emission induced by thermal quanta instead of a spontaneous emission , and this fact should be taken into account in spectroscopic studies and in development of terahertz generators @xcite operating at room temperature ( @xmath57 ) .    the suggested theory , based on the approximate relations ( [ interaction3 ] ) , ( [ interaction5 ] ) , and ( [ interaction6 ] ) , is quite general in nature , because the hamiltonian ( [ interaction1 ] ) has the same structure as the hamiltonian describing the interaction of an arbitrary system of charged particles with a transverse electromagnetic field .",
    "for this reason , the theory framed here applies to calculating the radiation emitted by two - level atoms , as well as radiation emitted by free charged particles in cherenkov oscillators and free electron lasers , which we shall demonstrate in subsequent works .",
