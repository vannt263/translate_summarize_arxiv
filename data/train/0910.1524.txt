    "planets form in protoplanetary gas discs as dust grains collide and grow to ever larger bodies @xcite .",
    "accumulation of differentiated meteorite parent bodies must occur while @xmath0al and @xmath1fe are still present in the solar nebula , constraining their formation time to at most a million years after the formation of calcium - aluminium - rich inclusions ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this coincides with the gaseous solar nebula epoch and indicates that planetesimals and protoplanets of several hundred kilometres in size were accumulated in a dense gaseous environment .",
    "the alignment between the orbits of the planets and the rotation of the sun is one of the key pieces of evidence for the nebular hypothesis of the formation of the solar system .",
    "the large majority of satellites also orbit their host planet in what is termed the prograde direction , i.e.  orbit in the same direction as the planet orbits the sun , suggesting that they formed in circumplanetary discs .",
    "this regularity seems to extend to the predominantly prograde rotations of the planets and the largest asteroids .",
    "while the gas giant planets have likely been spun up by gas accretion , growth of solid planetary bodies by accretion of km - sized planetesimals is not generally expected to lead to systematic prograde rotation .",
    "post - accretion , giant impacts which can significantly change the obliquity and spin rate of protoplanets @xcite do so in a stochastic way yielding no preference for prograde motion .",
    "successful attempts to explain a _",
    "systematic _ prograde contribution from accretion of solids in a gas - free medium require special surface density profiles @xcite or `` semicollisional '' accretion @xcite , i.e. collisions between small particles and subsequent accretion into a prograde circumplanetary particle disc that feeds the central object .            in this paper",
    "we show that prograde rotation may be a natural consequence of planetesimal growth from accretion of cm - sized solids in a gaseous environment . providing a physical mechanism for prograde rotation in turn",
    "supports that the dominance of prograde rotation among the largest asteroids is significant despite their low number .",
    "our model assumes simultaneous presence of cm - sized `` pebbles '' and gas .",
    "such conditions are supported by observations of protoplanetary discs , which show evidence of dust growth to at least a few cm @xcite .",
    "the inferred population of mm - cm pebbles can be very substantial , on the order of @xmath2 solar masses @xcite .",
    "we present hydrodynamical computer simulations of the accretion of pebbles and rocks onto young protoplanets in a gaseous nebula environment .",
    "we find that particle streams interacting with the gas far out within the hill sphere dissipate enough energy that the particles spiral down towards the protoplanet and form a prograde accretion disc .",
    "the prograde motion is transferred to protoplanet rotation as the particles are accreted . to explain the observed rotations of the largest asteroids and kuiper belt objects",
    ", we propose that protoplanets accreted a major fraction ( 10%50% ) of their mass from pebbles and rocks during the gaseous solar nebula phase .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in ",
    "[ s : setup ] we describe the set up of our simulations . in ",
    "[ s : results ] the main results are presented , both for 2-d and 3-d simulations .",
    "we speculate in  [ s : discussion ] about implications for the observed prograde rotation of large asteroids and the future prospect of measuring rotation directions of kuiper belt objects .",
    "we conclude on our findings in  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "the appendices contain details that do not appear in the main paper and several tests of the validity of our results . in appendix",
    "[ s : dyneq ] the dynamical equations are presented .",
    "we validate the code in appendix [ s : validate ] against known results on the accreted angular momentum .",
    "appendix [ s : mmsn ] describes drag forces in more detail and also the translation from dimensionless friction time to physical particle size . in appendix",
    "[ s : collide ] we compare time - scales of drag force and particle collisions and conclude that drag forces are by far the dominant force , except in regions that are highly particle dominated . in appendix",
    "[ s : converge ] we present results at lower and higher resolution and conclude that prograde rotation is strengthened with increasing resolution .",
    "the dependence of the results on the size of the simulation box are treated in appendix [ s : boxsize ] .",
    "we perform numerical simulations of the coupled motion of solids and gas in a local coordinate frame corotating with the disc at the keplerian frequency @xmath3 at an arbitrary distance @xmath4 from the central star @xcite .",
    "coordinate axes are oriented such that @xmath5 points radially away from the star and @xmath6 points along the rotation direction of the disc .",
    "particles are treated by a lagrangian method , interacting with the gas through two - way drag forces operating on the friction time - scale @xmath7 .",
    "an additional gravitational force contribution from a protoplanet of mass @xmath8 fixed in the centre of the coordinate frame is added .",
    "the gas is evolved on a fixed grid and also feels the gravity of the protoplanet ( see appendix [ s : dyneq ] for details on the dynamical equations ) . in appendix [ s : validate ] we validate the results of the code against known results on angular momentum accretion @xcite .",
    "momentum conservation in the two - way drag force coupling between solid particles and gas is assured by assigning the drag force added on a particle back to the gas with the opposite sign by a second order scheme .",
    "this drag force scheme has been shown to successfully reproduce the linear growth rate of streaming instabilities in protoplanetary discs @xcite .",
    "we integrate the dynamical equations of particles and gas using the high order finite difference code pencil code @xcite .",
    "to avoid underresolution of motion near the protoplanet , we always freeze the gas inside a ring of diametre eight grid points around the protoplanet .",
    "particles crossing that ring are considered to be accreted onto the protoplanet .    the hill radius , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gravity constant , bounds the region where the gravity of the protoplanet dominates over the tidal force from the star . in a protoplanetary disc with vertical pressure scale height @xmath11 , a protoplanet with mass @xmath12 has @xmath13 . at @xmath14 , with disc aspect ratio @xmath15 , the protoplanet has mass @xmath16 and radius @xmath17 km . at @xmath18 ( disc aspect ratio @xmath19 )",
    "the protoplanet mass would be @xmath20 and its radius @xmath21 km .",
    "we use a standard box size of @xmath22 , at a standard resolution of @xmath23 grid points and @xmath24 particles .",
    "this gives a resolution element of around 5,000 kilometres , making the inner cavity 20,000 kilometres in radius at the standard resolution . in appendix",
    "[ s : converge ] we present @xmath25 and @xmath26 simulations .",
    "the inner cavity corresponds to 1/10 , 1/20 and 1/40 of the hill radius for low , medium and high resolution studies , respectively .",
    "the convergence test in appendix [ s : converge ] shows that the prograde rotation is strengthened at higher resolution with a correspondingly smaller inner accretion radius .",
    "in figure [ f : mainresult ] we show results of a simulation with an assumed solids - to - gas ratio @xmath27 of unity ( mimicking conditions in a sedimentary mid - plane layer ) and a friction time @xmath28 ( relative to the inverse keplerian orbital frequency ) .",
    "this friction time represents particles of a few cm in radius @xcite .",
    "see appendix [ s : mmsn ] for details .",
    "the total mass of particles in the simulation domain is approximately @xmath29 at @xmath30 ( with particle column density @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 at @xmath33 ( with @xmath34 ) .",
    "as time progresses a spiral density wave structure appears inside the hill sphere .",
    "particles are accreted primarily from the second and fourth quadrants .",
    "as the particles drag the gas along towards the protoplanet surface , and the gas is nearly incompressible , the gas leaves through a `` wind '' in the first and third quadrants .",
    "this wind prevents particles from entering from these sides .",
    "later in the simulation the particle - gas layer becomes turbulent , due to the bubbles of gas expanding from the protoplanet surface .",
    "a prograde particle disc forms around the protoplanet , still fed from the second and fourth quadrants .",
    "this disc is completely dominated by particles ( @xmath35 ) and accretes slowly , due to stirring by the turbulent surroundings .",
    "we show in appendix [ s : collide ] that while particle collisions are negligible in most of the simulation domain , collisions will dominate over gas drag in the circumplanetary disc . however , we do not model the collisional viscosity in the presented simulations , as we wish to keep the system as simple as possible . a numerical algorithm for treating collisions between superparticles",
    "is currently under development ( johansen , lithwick , & youdin , in preparation ) .    in figure",
    "[ f : angmom_deliv ] we plot the angular momentum of accreted particles as a function of time , for a subset of randomly sampled particles . initially , during the spiral density wave phase , there is a preference for accreting prograde particles .",
    "this is normally followed by a short phase of retrograde accretion , where a retrograde accretion disc may temporarily form .",
    "eventually the particles always enter a prograde accretion disc , and the protoplanet accretes the full keplerian surface frequency .",
    "convergence tests are presented in appendix [ s : converge ] .",
    "both lower and higher resolution studies result in a similar amount of prograde accretion , although there is a trend for accreting stronger prograde rotation with increasing resolution . in appendix [ s : boxsize ] we present results for a box size of @xmath36 .",
    "the larger box size has a net positive effect on the prograde rotation of the protoplanet .",
    "the sign of the angular momentum is more consistently positive than in the small box , and there are fewer periods of retrogade accretion .       particles ( top plot ) readily form a prograde particle disc .",
    "the particles are much less affected by the gas than the particles presented in fig .",
    "[ f : angmom_deliv ] , thus the particle disc accretes very slowly .",
    "smaller particles with @xmath37 , corresponding to sizes of a few mm , are so coupled to the gas that accretion takes place as a sedimentation towards the protoplanet , with a significant loss of angular momentum to the gas ( bottom plot).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]   particles ( top plot ) readily form a prograde particle disc .",
    "the particles are much less affected by the gas than the particles presented in fig .",
    "[ f : angmom_deliv ] , thus the particle disc accretes very slowly .",
    "smaller particles with @xmath37 , corresponding to sizes of a few mm , are so coupled to the gas that accretion takes place as a sedimentation towards the protoplanet , with a significant loss of angular momentum to the gas ( bottom plot).,title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    it was shown analytically by @xcite that particles approaching the protoplanet feel the opposing effects of protoplanet gravity ( at large distances ) and gravitational scattering ( at short distances ) . for particles with @xmath38 , drag forces are so strong that particles are accreted into the hill sphere , while larger particles are scattered by the planet and only approach the protoplanet to some minimum distance . similarly @xcite showed that planetesimals above a certain size are trapped in mean motion resonances with growing planets .",
    "this shepherding might affect boulders of sizes metres to ten metres .    in fig .",
    "[ f : lz_t_size ] we show the accretion of larger , @xmath39 , and smaller , @xmath40 , particles , corresponding to a few metres and a few millimetres , respectively .",
    "the larger particles readily form a prograde particle disc around the protoplanet . however",
    ", the marginal coupling to the gas makes the particle disc much more stable to dynamical shaking by the surrounding gas , and the disc only accretes slowly .",
    "smaller particles , on the other hand , are very coupled to the gas , and accretion takes place as a slow sedimentation .",
    "the particles lose a significant fraction of their angular momentum to the gas and arrive almost perpendicular to the protoplanet surface .",
    "thus we can put a relatively tight constraint on the particle sizes that can lead to prograde rotation of protoplanets . a dimensionless friction time between",
    "approximately @xmath41 and @xmath42 corresponds to particles of radii between a few cm and a few ten cm .",
    "however , at several ten au from the central star , where the gas column density drops to @xmath43 , the `` good '' particle sizes are between a few mm and a few cm , approximately corresponding to the pebbles that are observed in the outer regions of protoplanetary discs @xcite .      an additional effect that we have not considered",
    "so far is the sub - keplerian motion of the gas . as the gas is slightly pressure supported in the radial direction , the gas orbital motion is slower ( by approximately 5% of the sound speed or 0.5% of the keplerian speed ) than the keplerian value ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "isolated particles face a constant headwind of the gas , causing them to orbit slower and to drift radially .",
    "the stationary protoplanet is thus exposed to a `` sandblast '' with velocity @xmath44 . in fig .",
    "[ f : sandblast ] we consider a simulation of @xmath28 particles with an initial solids - to - gas ratio of 10 .",
    "the strong mass loading of particles reduces the head wind significantly in the beginning , and we observe the usual prograde accretion .",
    "however , as the particles lose influence on the gas , a sandblasting phase occurs in which no net rotation is induced on the protoplanet .",
    "overall the protoplanet nevertheless accretes a significant fraction of the keplerian surface frequency .           and @xmath45 .",
    "we recover the usual preference for prograde accretion , showing that the higher resolution 2-d simulations presented in the fig .",
    "[ f : angmom_deliv ] represent the physical system well.,width=264 ]        for simplicity , and to obtain higher resolution and smaller accretion radius , we have so far presented results of 2-d simulations . in this section",
    "we show that we obtain similar results in 3-d as in 2-d .",
    "we ignore the effect of vertical gravity and stratification on the gas , a small effect in boxes with a vertical extent of @xmath46 .",
    "we initialize the particles with a gaussian density distribution around the mid - plane , of scale height @xmath47 , and a column density of @xmath48 relative to the gas .",
    "the results of a 3-d simulation with @xmath49 grid points and @xmath50 particles are shown in fig .",
    "[ f:3dacc ] .",
    "the particles show the usual strong preference for prograde accretion .",
    "a prograde accretion disc also forms around the protoplanet in the 3-d simulation ( see fig .",
    "[ f:3d ] ) , but this is not as evident from the accreted angular momentum as in 2-d because isolated particles , now entering from all directions , are accreted faster than the disc material .",
    "we conclude that our assumption of 2-d flow represents the true 3-d physical behaviour of the system well .",
    "the 2-d assumption , at the same time , allows for much higher resolution investigations and a higher particle number per grid cell .",
    "the asteroid belt is a collisionally evolved collection of rocky and icy bodies residing roughly between the orbits of mars and jupiter .",
    "analytical and numerical studies indicate that the largest asteroids have not suffered enough collisional evolution to significantly alter their spin vector @xcite .",
    "these objects have thus likely retained their primordial spin angular momentum and may be representative of the original protoplanet population ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "figure [ f : poles ] depicts a collection of spin axis obliquities of 62 asteroids larger than 50 km in diametre ( from * ? ? ?",
    "the obliquity is here defined as the angle between the pole vector of an asteroid and the normal to the ecliptic plane .",
    "while smaller asteroids have collisionally randomized obliquities , the largest ones ( @xmath51 km ) display a propensity towards prograde rotation ( obliquity @xmath52 ) , i.e.  rotation in the same direction as the orbit .",
    "indeed , the two most massive asteroids , ceres and vesta , spin progradely with obliquities of @xmath53 and @xmath54 and periods 9.1 and 5.3 hours . if their spin orientations were collisionally randomized , the probability that their mean obliquity is less than the observed value is only @xmath55 ( 3@xmath56 ) . in fig .",
    "[ f : prograde_significance ] we show the mean pole angle ( relative to the ecliptic ) of asteroids as a function of their size .",
    "there is a trend towards prograde rotation for all size ranges , although the statistical significance is only @xmath57@xmath58 @xmath56 .",
    "the kuiper belt , a dynamically stable region beyond neptune , preserves roughly a dozen known 1000 km - scale icy bodies @xcite . as in the case of asteroids , collisional evolution simulations of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) show that bodies larger than @xmath59  km have sustained relatively mild collisional evolution @xcite and their primordial spins have survived the random effect of impacts for the age of the solar system @xcite .",
    "no kbo obliquities have been derived as the known objects have moved less than @xmath60 along their orbits since discovery , but several rotation periods have been measured ( fig .",
    "[ f : spins ] ) . with",
    "the exception of pluto and haumea , both believed to have suffered massive collisions @xcite , the rotation periods of kbos larger than @xmath61 km lie in a narrow 5 to 20 hour range ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the same is true for ceres and the other three asteroids in the same size range , which have orbital timescales one to two orders of magnitude shorter than kbos .",
    "such uniformity in spin period for bodies with different compositions and presumably formed and evolved at very different heliocentric distances suggests a common spin - up mechanism .",
    "each asteroid is represented by a blue ( black ) dot , connected to the origin by a grey line .",
    "the angle between each grey line and the positive @xmath6-axis is the obliquity of the corresponding asteroid .",
    "the length of the lines gives the spin frequency of the asteroid in rotations per day .",
    "asteroids in the upper quadrant are prograde and asteroids in the lower quadrant are retrograde .",
    "asteroids larger than @xmath62 km , represented by larger , red ( dark grey ) dots , show a preference for prograde rotation.,width=188 ]     region expected from random spin orientations .",
    "the line is above the grey area until approximately the 10th largest asteroid , although low significance prograde rotation persists even for smaller asteroids . ]",
    "hour period range irrespective of their other physical properties .",
    "outliers haumea ( h ) and pluto ( p ) are marked ; they are believed to have suffered massive collisions.,width=283 ]      the numerical experiments presented in ",
    "[ s : results ] show that accretion of particle sizes of a few cm to a few m and a solids - to - gas ratio around unity or higher ( see figure 3 ) leads to a systematic prograde rotation of protoplanets , in agreement with the observed trend in the largest asteroids .",
    "this moderately high solids - to - gas ratio points to the sedimentary mid - plane , or to dense particle clumps appearing in such a mid - plane layer ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , as a prime site for the growth of protoplanets .",
    "the evaporation of gas by irradiation from the central star or neighbouring o stars leads to a similar increase in the influence of the dust particles on the gas @xcite .",
    "our simulations predict that the largest kuiper belt objects should preferentially rotate in the prograde direction around their axis .",
    "a few exceptions to this trend are objects that have suffered massive impacts ( e.g. haumea , * ? ? ?",
    "pure accretion from a circumplanetary disc would lead to a protoplanet rotation period of only a few hours , near the centrifugal break up speed . however , accretion from a circumplanetary disc need not be the only mass source .",
    "growth phases with little or no accreted angular momentum can occur when the protoplanet accretes isolated dust particles and pebbles or km - sized planetesimals or other protoplanets . protoplanets thus need to obtain between 10% and 50% of their mass from the accretion of macroscopic dust particles in a gaseous environment .",
    "the lower limit is relevant if all pebbles are accreted at the full keplerian angular momentum , while the upper limit is relevant if 80% of the mass accretion occurs through pebble sandblasting or through accretion of `` planetesimals '' with high @xmath63 .",
    "the sub - keplerian sandblasting effect described in  [ s : sandblast ] means that the mechanism for obtaining prograde rotation works best in particle - dominated flows or in regions of low radial drift .",
    "the radial drift can be reduced or even reversed in persistent pressure bumps appearing in the gas @xcite .",
    "recent studies have shown how planetesimal formation by self - gravity @xcite and by coagulation ( @xcite ; @xcite ) proceed in such convergence regions in the flow of solid particles .",
    "it was recently proposed by @xcite that inelastic particle collisions will lead to accretion of prograde rotation from a circumplanetary particle disc during the gas - free stages of planetary growth .",
    "such a mechanism may be able to provide additional prograde angular momentum after the giant impact stage .",
    "this is especially relevant for the terrestrial planets which are believed to have been accumulated over 10 - 100 million years in a gas free environment @xcite .",
    "mercury , earth and mars all have prograde spins , but the spins of the terrestrial planets have been substantially modified by long - term perturbations by other planets @xcite .    focusing instead on the largest asteroids and kuiper belt objects , our numerical simulations show that pebbles and rocks are accreted very efficiently by the protoplanets . in the main numerical simulation presented in  [ s : results ] the protoplanet+disc system accretes 1/7 of the protoplanet mass in five orbits ( @xmath64 25 years at 3 au ) .",
    "such high accretion rates are facilitated by the presence of gas in the hill sphere .",
    "this indicates that young protoplanets can accrete lots of material already during the protoplanetary gas disc phase . the actual ratio of accretion during and after the gaseous disc phase is nevertheless relatively unconstrained and deserves further attention in the future .",
    "we present computer simulations of the accretion of pebbles and rocks onto young protoplanets in a gaseous nebula environment .",
    "our findings can be summarised as follows :    * particle streams interacting with the gas far out in the hill sphere of the growing protoplanet dissipate enough energy that the particles spiral down towards the central object and form a prograde accretion disc .",
    "the prograde motion is transferred to the protoplanet as the particles are accreted . * in order to explain the observed rotations of the largest asteroids and kuiper belt objects , we propose that protoplanets accreted a major fraction ( 10%50% ) of their mass from pebbles and rocks during the gaseous solar nebula phase . *",
    "a specific prediction of our model is that most of the largest kuiper belt objects should possess prograde spins .    since the keplerian surface frequency depends only on the density of the protoplanet , accretion from a keplerian particle disc",
    "explains how asteroids and kuiper belt objects can have similar rotation periods even though the orbital time - scale is much longer in the kuiper belt .",
    "our results imply not just a universality in the rotation period of solid bodies in the solar system , but also in the formation process and in the important role of gas and pebbles for the growth of hundred kilometre scale protoplanets .",
    "future numerical work should focus on the extension of the presented model to include turbulence driven by global instabilities and more realistic solid physics , such as a distribution of particle sizes , collisional viscosity and collisional fragmentation .",
    "computer simulations were performed at the pia cluster of the max planck institute for astronomy .",
