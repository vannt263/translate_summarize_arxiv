    "the term tensor used in the context of this paper refers to a multi - dimensional array , also known as a multi - way or multi - mode array .",
    "for example , if @xmath0 , then we say @xmath1 is a third - order tensor , where order is the number of ways or modes of the tensor .",
    "thus , vectors and matrices are first - order and second - order tensors , respectively .",
    "higher - order tensors arise in a wide variety of application areas , such as machine learning ( tomioka and suzuki , 2013 ; signoretto et al . ,",
    "2014 ) , computer vision ( liu et al . , 2009 ) , data mining ( yilmaz et al . , 2011 ; morup , 2011 ; narita et al . , 2012 ; liu et al . , 2014 ) , numerical linear algebra ( lathauwer et al .",
    ", 2000a ; 2000b ) , and so on . especially , with the rapid development of modern computer technology in recent years , tensors are becoming increasingly ubiquitous such as multi - channel images and videos , and have become increasingly popular ( kolda and bader , 2009 ) .",
    "when working with high - order tensor data , various new computational challenges arise due to the exponential increase in time and memory space complexity when the number of orders increases .",
    "this is called the curse of dimensionality . in practice ,",
    "the underlying tensor is often low - rank , even though the actual data may not be due to noise or arbitrary errors .",
    "essentially , the major component contained in the given tensor is often governed by a relatively small number of latent factors .",
    "one standard tool to alleviate the curse is tensor decomposition .",
    "decomposition of high - order tensors into a small number of factors has been one of the main tasks in multi - way data analysis , and commonly takes two forms : tucker decomposition ( tucker , 1966 ) and candecomp / parafac ( cp ) ( harshman , 1970 ) decomposition .",
    "there are extensive studies in the literature for finding the tucker decomposition and the cp decomposition for higher - order tensors ( kolda and bader , 2009 ) . in those tensor decomposition methods ,",
    "their goal is to ( approximately ) reconstruct the input tensor as a sum of simpler components with the hope that these simpler components would reveal the latent structure of the data .",
    "however , existing tensor decomposition methods face three major challenges : rank selection , outliers and gross corruptions , and computational efficiency .",
    "since the tucker and cp decomposition methods are based on least - squares approximation , they are also very sensitive to outliers and gross corruptions ( goldfarb and qin , 2014 ) . in addition",
    ", the performance of those methods is usually sensitive to the given ranks of the involved tensor ( liu et al . , 2009 ) .",
    "to address the problems , we propose two robust and parallel higher - order tensor decomposition methods with trace norm regularization .",
    "recently , much attention has been drawn to the low - rank tensor recovery problem , which arises in a number of real - word applications , such as 3d image recovery , video inpainting , hyperspectral data recovery , and face reconstruction .",
    "compared with matrix - based analysis methods , tensor - based multi - linear data analysis has shown that tensor models are capable of taking full advantage of the high - order structure to provide better understanding and more precision .",
    "the key idea of low - rank tensor completion and recovery methods is to employ matrix trace norm minimization ( also known as the nuclear norm , which is the convex surrogate of the rank of the involved matrix ) .",
    "in addition , there are some theoretical developments that guarantee reconstruction of a low - rank tensor from partial measurements or grossly corrupted observations via solving the trace norm minimization problem under some reasonable conditions ( tomioka et al . , 2011 ;",
    "shi et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "motivated by the recent progress in tensor completion and recovery , one goal of this paper is to extend the trace norm regularization to robust higher - order tensor decomposition .",
    "different from existing tensor decomposition methods , we first propose a parallel trace norm regularized tensor decomposition method , which can automatically determine the number of factors in each mode through our optimization scheme .",
    "in other words , this method does not require the rank of each mode to be specified beforehand .",
    "in addition , by considering the low - rank structure of the observed tensor and further improving the scalability of our convex method , we analyze the equivalent relationship of the trace norm between a low - rank tensor and its core tensor .",
    "then , we cast the non - convex trace norm regularized higher - order orthogonal iteration model into a weighted combination of multiple much - smaller - scale matrix trace norm minimization .",
    "moreover , we design two parallel alternating direction methods of multipliers ( admm ) to solve the proposed problems , which are shown to be fast , insensitive to initialization and robust to noise and/or outliers with extensive experiments .",
    "we first introduce the notations , and more details can be seen in kolda and bader ( 2009 ) .",
    "an @xmath2th - order tensor is denoted by a calligraphic letter , e.g. , @xmath3 , and its entries are denoted by @xmath4 , where @xmath5 for @xmath6 .",
    "fibers are the higher - order analogue of matrix rows and columns .",
    "the mode-@xmath7 fibers are vectors @xmath8 that are obtained by fixing the values of @xmath9 .    the mode-@xmath7 unfolding , also known as matricization , of an @xmath2th - order tensor @xmath10 is denoted by @xmath11 and",
    "arranges the mode-@xmath7 fibers to be the columns of the resulting matrix @xmath12 such that the mode-@xmath7 fiber becomes the row index and all other @xmath13 modes become the column indices .",
    "the tensor element @xmath14 is mapped to the matrix element @xmath15 , where @xmath16    the inner product of two same - sized tensors @xmath17 @xmath18 and @xmath19 is the sum of the product of their entries , @xmath20 .",
    "the frobenius norm of an @xmath2th - order @xmath10 is defined as : @xmath21    let @xmath22 and @xmath23 be two matrices of size @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the kronecker product of two matrices @xmath22 and @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath26 , is an @xmath27 matrix given by : @xmath28_{mp\\times{nq}}.\\ ] ] the @xmath7-mode matrix product of a tensor @xmath10 with a matrix @xmath29 , denoted by @xmath30 , is defined as : @xmath31      we will review two popular models for tensor decomposition , i.e. , the tucker decomposition and the candecomp / parafac ( cp ) decomposition . it is well known that finding the cp decomposition with the minimum tensor rank is a hard problem , and there is no straightforward algorithm for computing the rank for higher - order tensors ( hillar and lim , 2013 ) .",
    "the tucker decomposition decomposes a given tensor @xmath10 into a core tensor multiplied by a factor matrix along each mode as follows : @xmath32 where @xmath33 are the factor matrices , which can be thought of as the principal components in each mode , and the entries of the core tensor @xmath34 show the level of interaction between the different components .",
    "since the decomposition rank @xmath35 is in general much smaller than @xmath36 , the core tensor @xmath37 can be thought of as a low - rank version of @xmath10 ( e.g. , the tucker decomposition of a third - order tensor is illustrated in figure 1 ) . in this sense",
    ", the storage of the tucker decomposition form can be significantly smaller than that of the original tensor .",
    "moreover , unlike the rank of the tensor , @xmath38 , i.e. , the mode-@xmath7 rank @xmath39 , is the rank of the mode-@xmath7 unfolding , and is clearly computable .",
    "hence , we are particularly interested in extending the tucker decomposition for tensor analysis .",
    "if the factor matrices of the tucker decomposition are constrained orthogonal , the decomposition form is referred to as the higher - order singular value decomposition ( hosvd , lathauwer et al . , 2000a ) or higher - order orthogonal iteration ( hooi , lathauwer et al . , 2000b ) , where the latter leads to the estimation of best rank-@xmath40 approximations while the truncation of hosvd may achieve a good rank-@xmath40 approximation but in general not the best possible one ( lathauwer et al . , 2000b",
    ". therefore , hooi is the most widely used tensor decomposition method ( kolda and bader , 2009 ) , and takes the following form @xmath41",
    "given a tensor @xmath10 , our goal is to find a low - rank tensor @xmath1 , in order to minimize the frobenius norm of their difference as follows : @xmath42    different from the matrix case , the low - rank tensor estimation problem ( 3 ) is in general hard to solve ( narita et al . , 2012 ) . following the progress in tensor completion , we cast it into a ( weighted ) trace norm minimization problem : @xmath43 where @xmath44 denotes the trace norm of the unfolded matrix @xmath45 , i.e. , the sum of its singular values",
    ", @xmath46 is a regularization parameter . for handling the unbalanced target tensor",
    ", we briefly introduce the preselected weights @xmath47 ( satisfying @xmath48 ) to the trace norm term in ( 4 ) .      due to the interdependent matrix trace norm terms",
    ", the proposed tensor decomposition model ( 4 ) is very difficult to solve .",
    "thus , we introduce some auxiliary variables @xmath49 into the model ( 4 ) and reformulate it into the following equivalent form : @xmath50    in the following , we will design a parallel alternating direction method of multipliers ( admm ) for solving the problem ( 5 ) .",
    "the algorithm decomposes the original problem into smaller subproblems and solves them individually in parallel at each iteration .",
    "the parallel admm for the problem ( 5 ) is derived by minimizing the augmented lagrange function @xmath51 with respect to @xmath52 in parallel , and then updating the multiplier tensor @xmath53 .",
    "but the parallelization is likely to diverge , therefore , it is necessary to modify the common algorithm in a certain way to guarantee its convergence .",
    "several variants of parallel admm have been proposed in he ( 2009 ) and deng et al . , (",
    "2013 ) by taking additional correction steps at every iteration .",
    "similar to deng et al . , ( 2013 ) , we add some proximal terms to each subproblems and attach a relaxation parameter @xmath54 for the update of the penalty parameter @xmath55 .      by keeping all other variables fixed , the optimal @xmath57 is the solution to the following problem : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is a constant for the proximal term @xmath60 . following ( cai et al . , 2010 )",
    ", we obtain a closed - form solution to the problem ( 6 ) via the following proximal operator of the trace norm : @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes the refolding of the matrix into a tensor , i.e. , the reverse process of unfolding .",
    "the optimal @xmath63 with all other variables fixed is the solution to the following problem : @xmath64 where @xmath65 is a constant for the proximal term @xmath66 . since the problem ( 8) is a smooth convex optimization problem , it is easy to show that the optimal solution to ( 8) is given by @xmath67    based on the description above , we develop a parallel admm algorithm for the convex tensor decomposition ( ctd ) problem ( 5 ) , as outlined in * algorithm 1*. in algorithm 1 , we use a jacobi - type scheme to update @xmath68 blocks of variables , @xmath69 and @xmath1 . by the definition @xmath70 and @xmath71 , it is easy to verify that the problem ( 5 ) and algorithm 1 satisfy the convergence conditions in deng et al . , ( 2013 ) .",

    "hence , the sequence @xmath81 converges to an optimal solution to the low - rank tensor decomposition problem ( 4 ) .",
    "our convex tucker decomposition method employs matrix trace norm regularization and uses the singular value decomposition ( svd ) in algorithm 1 , which becomes a little slow or even not applicable for large - scale problems .",
    "motivated by this , we will propose a scalable non - convex low - rank tensor decomposition method .",
    "several researchers ( keshavan et al . , 2010 ; wen et al . , 2012 ) have provided some matrix rank estimation strategies to compute some good values @xmath82 for the _ n_-rank of the involved tensor .",
    "thus , we only set some relatively large integers @xmath83 such that @xmath84 , @xmath85 .",
    "let @xmath86 with @xmath2-rank@xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 satisfy @xmath90 , and @xmath91 , @xmath92 , then @xmath93    the proof of theorem 2 can be found in the supplemental material . according to the theorem , it is cleat that although the core tensor @xmath37 of size @xmath94 has much smaller sizes than the original tensor @xmath1 ( usually , @xmath95 ) , their trace norm is identical . in other words ,",
    "each unfolding @xmath96 of the core tensor @xmath37 has much smaller sizes than that of the original tensor , @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , we use the trace norm of each unfolding of the core tensor to replace that of the original tensor .      according to the analysis above ,",
    "our trace norm regularized hooi model is formulated into the following form : @xmath98 the core tensor trace norm regularized hooi model ( 11 ) , also called generalized hooi , can alleviate the svd computational burden of large unfolded matrices involved in the convex tucker decomposition problem ( 4 ) .",
    "furthermore , we use the trace norm regularization term in ( 11 ) to promote the robustness of the rank selection , while the original tucker decomposition method is usually sensitive to the given ranks @xmath94 ( liu et al . , 2009 ) . due to the interdependent matrix trace norm terms",

    "is formulated as follows : @xmath103 following ( lathauwer et al . , 2000b ) , it is sufficient to determine the matrices @xmath102 for the optimization of the problem ( 13 ) . for any estimate of these matrices , the optimal solution with respect to @xmath37",
