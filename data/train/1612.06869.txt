    "the sed fitting method allows estimation of the plausible stellar mass ; however , the total sample number decreases due to the limited survey area in which nir data are available .",
    "therefore , we also utilize a `` main sequence '' of star - forming galaxies ( ms ; e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to evaluate galaxy stellar masses , instead of the sed fitting results , to use all of the lbg samples obtained in the entire cfhtls field and achieve high s / n clustering analyses .",

    "we compare stellar - mass functions of each dropout galaxy with the results of @xcite and @xcite , and the lowest stellar - mass limit is determined as the mass of which the observed stellar - mass functions reach @xmath104 completeness .",
    "the number of lbg sample of each subsample are summarized in table  [ tab : param ] .",
    "we compute stellar masses of dropout galaxy samples with two independent estimates : the main sequence of star - forming galaxies and the sed fitting technique .",
    "the ms relation is a convenient way to assess stellar masses of star - forming galaxies from their uv luminosities ; however , derived stellar masses could suffer from non - negligible uncertainties due to the relatively large scatter .",
    "on the other hand , the sed fitting technique is frequently used to give more reliable estimates of the stellar mass , although broad wavelength coverage of the data set is required .",
    "the balmer/@xmath105 break is an essential spectral feature to obtain accurate stellar masses in the sed fitting technique .",
    "it should be noted that the balmer break can be traced by wircam data for @xmath63- and @xmath43-dropout galaxies , but not for @xmath44-dropout galaxies .",

    "these two estimations show nearly a one - to - one correspondence , albeit with relatively large scatter .",
    "scatters on the stellar mass evaluated from the ms relation is due to the intrinsic @xmath103 dex scatter in equation  ( [ eq : ms ] ) , whereas the small scatter of the sed fitting technique for the massive galaxies ( red cross at the right of figure  [ fig : comp_mstar ] ) originates from their apparent balmer/@xmath105 break .",
    "the same consistency can also be obtained for @xmath43-dropout galaxies .",
    "we assume that these two estimations are consistent with respect to the other , with minimal significant difference .",
    "hereafter , we will use the ms relation that allows the stellar - mass estimation down to the faint magnitudes for the entire cfhtls field , even without wircam data , to estimate the stellar mass in the following analyses .",
    "we also assume that the consistency between these two estimations is valid for @xmath44-dropout galaxies .",

    "<S> deep- and wide - field images of the cfhtls deep survey enable us to obtain sufficiently accurate two - point angular correlation functions to apply a halo occupation distribution analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the mean halo masses , calculated as @xmath3 , increase with stellar - mass limit of lbgs . </S>",
    "<S> the threshold halo mass to have a central galaxy , @xmath4 , follows the same increasing trend with the low-@xmath5 results , whereas the threshold halo mass to have a satellite galaxy , @xmath6 , shows higher values at @xmath7 than @xmath8 over the entire stellar mass range . </S>",
    "<S> along with considering the low satellite fractions in high-@xmath5 , these results suggest that satellite galaxies form inefficiently within dark haloes at @xmath9 even for less massive satellites with @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we compute stellar - to - halo mass ratios ( shmrs ) assuming a main sequence of galaxies , which is found to provide consistent shmrs with those derived from a spectral energy distribution fitting method . </S>",
    "<S> the observed shmrs are in good agreement with the model predictions based on the abundance - matching method within @xmath11 confidence intervals . </S>",
    "<S> we show , for the first time observationally , the increasing trend of @xmath12 , which is the halo mass with a peak shmr , with cosmic time at @xmath13 , and with keeping the constant star - formation efficiency indicates that mass growth rates of stellar components and dark haloes are comparable at @xmath14 . </S>"
