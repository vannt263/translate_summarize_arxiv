    "the x - ray source  is a 7.7 s pulsar in a highly compact binary system of orbital period 2485  s. it is unusual in that it is one of the few low mass x - ray binary systems to contain an x - ray pulsar .",
    "while the x - ray emission is strongly modulated by the pulsar , there is no evidence for doppler shifts induced by the orbital motion of the source , despite extensive searches .",

    "however , long term monitoring by the burst and transient source experiment ( batse ) on - board the compton gamma - ray observatory beginning in 1991 april found that @xmath10 , and hence the accretion torque , had changed sign , resulting in a spin - down at nearly the same rate ( wilson et al .",
    "it is estimated that the reversal occurred in mid-1990 .",
    "observations of  during the earlier spin - up phase found that the phase averaged spectrum could be modeled by a blackbody of temperature , kt , @xmath10.6 kev together with a power - law of photon index , @xmath11 , of @xmath11 ( e.g. , pravdo et al .",

    "the pulse profile consisted of a narrow pulse with a `` notch '' , while at higher and lower energies this evolved into a roughly sinusoidal shape ( levine et al .",

    "the total source exposure is 40 ks and the mean lecs count rate is @xmath13  s@xmath9 . because of the large spatial extent of the point spread function , background data were acquired separately by viewing blank regions of sky . background subtraction is not critical for such a bright source .",

    "the extracted data were rebinned to have bin widths of 0.25 @xmath14 the fwhm energy resolution .",
    "this is to help ensure an unbiased fit across the energy range , while preserving sensitivity to line features .",
