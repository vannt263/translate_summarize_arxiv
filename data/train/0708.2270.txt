    "the half - duplex relay channel differs from the full - duplex relay channel @xcite in the inability of the relay to simultaneously transmit and receive signals . in many practical systems ,",
    "the half - duplex assumption provides a more realistic model of the relay channel .",
    "a number of information theoretic studies @xcite@xcite of the half - duplex relay channel have been carried out .",
    "the focus of these studies is usually on the special case in which the links in the relay channel are gaussian . in particular ,",
    "the half - duplex relay channel is modeled in @xcite as a special case of a full - duplex relay channel with an additional input symbol at the relay to describe whether the relay is listening or transmitting .",
    "then the bounds and achievability results for the full - duplex relay channel in @xcite are directly applied to the half - duplex specialization .",
    "one interesting observation made in @xcite is that the listen - transmit schedule of the relay can actually carry additional information when it is made to depend on the message to be sent .",
    "if the relay listen - transmit schedule is restricted to be deterministic , i.e. , the same for any message , separate consideration , as suggested in @xcite , of the time during which the relay listens or transmits leads to bounds and achievability results for the half - duplex relay channel that are similar to the corresponding counterparts of the full - duplex relay channel .    in this paper",
    ", we consider a discrete memoryless half - duplex relay channel . based on physical reasoning",
    ", the half - duplex relay channel has two modes of operation  the broadcast ( bc ) mode and the multiple access ( ma ) mode . when the relay listens , the channel is in the bc mode , which is specified by a bc channel from the source to the relay and destination . when the relay transmits , the channel is in the ma mode , which is specified by a ma channel from the source and relay to the destination .",
    "here we are mainly interested in the special case in which the bc channel is physically degraded . by combining the aforementioned ideas in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "we show that the capacity of this degraded half - duplex relay channel can be achieved via a decode - forward approach employing a modified version of the block markov coding technique suggested in @xcite to accommodate the inclusion of random relay listen - transmit schedule and separate treatment of the two modes of the relay channel .",
    "if the relay schedule is restricted to be deterministic , we argue that a simple management of the flows of information across the bc and ma component channels is sufficient to achieve capacity .",
    "we consider the half - duplex relay channel as a special case of the classical discrete memoryless relay channel studied in @xcite with the addition of an extra input at the relay to describe its state .",
    "this relay channel model as well as its specialization to the half - duplex case will be described below .",
    "we note that a similar formulation for the gaussian relay channel is suggested in @xcite .",
    "consider the relay channel shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fdrelay ] .",
    "it consists of five finite sets @xmath0 and a collection of probability mass functions ( pmfs ) @xmath1 , one for every @xmath2 , where @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 denotes the input alphabet at the source , @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively denote the input alphabet and state at the relay , @xmath7 denotes the output alphabet at destination and @xmath8 denotes the output alphabet at the relay .",
    "a @xmath9 code for the above relay channel consists of a set of integers @xmath10 , an encoding function @xmath11 , a collection of @xmath12 relaying functions @xmath13 , and a decoding function @xmath14 .",
    "the relaying functions are defined so that @xmath15th input symbol at the relay depends only on the previously received output symbols at the relay .",
    "if we assume that the distribution of messages over @xmath16 is uniform , the average probability of error for the @xmath9 code is @xmath17 a rate @xmath18 is achievable if there exist a sequence of @xmath9 codes with @xmath19",
    ".      the relay in the half - duplex relay channel can either listen or transmit , but not both at the same time . as a result , the half - duplex relay channel has two modes of operation , the broadcast ( bc ) mode and the multiple access ( ma ) mode , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : modes ] .        in the bc mode ,",
    "the channel is specified by @xmath20 , which describes a bc channel from the source to the relay and destination . here",
    "@xmath4 denotes the input alphabet at the source , @xmath7 denotes the output alphabet at destination and @xmath8 denotes the output alphabet at the relay .",
    "the collection of pmfs @xmath21 , one each for every @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , specify the operation of this bc channel . in the ma mode , the channel is specified by @xmath24 , which describes a ma channel from the source and relay to the destination . here @xmath4 denotes the input alphabet at the source , @xmath5 denotes the input alphabet at relay and @xmath7 denotes the output alphabet at the destination . the collection of pmfs @xmath25 , one each for every @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , specify the operation of this ma channel .    to account for the above two different modes of operation , we embed the half - duplex relay channel in the channel model of the previous subsection .",
    "first , we set @xmath28 , where @xmath29 will denote the event when the relay is listening and @xmath30 will denote the event when the relay is transmitting . the relay by listening or transmitting causes the half - duplex relay channel to operate in the bc mode and ma mode , respectively . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that the output alphabet at the relay @xmath8 contains an erasure symbol @xmath31 such that @xmath32 for all @xmath33 .",
    "then the channel pmf @xmath34 of the previous subsection is defined in terms of @xmath35 and @xmath36 in the following manner : @xmath37 for all @xmath38 , where @xmath39 if @xmath40 and @xmath41 otherwise .",
    "this definition imposes the physical restrictions that the outputs at the destination and relay in the bc mode ( when relay listens ) do not depend on the relay input @xmath42 , and that the output at the relay is always erased in the ma mode ( when relay transmits ) .",
    "in addition , we need the following restriction on the source distribution @xmath43 to accurately reflect the operation of a half - duplex channel : @xmath44 for some symbol @xmath45 . the symbol @xmath46 can be thought of as a `` quiet '' symbol chosen by the relay when it is listening .",
    "we will implicitly assume that this restriction is satisfied whenever the source distribution @xmath43 is referred hereafter .",
    "for the rest of the paper , we will assume that the bc channel component is physically degraded , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "if this condition is satisfied , we will call the half - duplex relay channel physically degraded .",
    "we note that however the channel @xmath1 is not physically degraded in the sense of @xcite , i.e. , @xmath48 .",
    "the max - flow min - cut bound ( * ? ? ?",
    "14.10.1 ) on the relay channel @xmath1 gives the following outer bound : @xmath49 specializing this bound to the half - duplex relay channel , the first term on the right hand side of ( [ eqn : maxmin ] ) can be expanded as follows , @xmath50 where the second equality follows from the specialization in ( [ eqn : hdrpmf ] ) of the bc mode and the erasure of @xmath51 in the ma mode .",
    "the second term on the right hand side of ( [ eqn : maxmin ] ) can be written as @xmath52 where the second equality is due to the fact that @xmath53 and @xmath54 . substituting ( [ eqn : halfbnd1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : halfbnd2 ] ) in ( [ eqn : maxmin ] ) , we get @xmath55 where the equality in the last line above is due to the degradedness of the half - duplex relay channel .",
    "the upper bound on capacity in ( [ eqn : halfbndfin ] ) suggests a particular structure for the optimal code .",
    "we note that the upper bound involves products of conditional mutual informations , where the conditioning is on particular values of @xmath56 , and the probabilities of @xmath56 taking these values .",
    "such products can arise in the bounds on the probability of error , if we restrict our attention to those coordinates of the @xmath12-sequences of random variables where @xmath56 takes a particular value .",
    "suppose we generate a random code and restrict the code to the coordinates where @xmath57 .",
    "then the probability that a pair of independently generated random variable sequences are jointly typical will be approximately equal to @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the number of coordinates where @xmath60 and @xmath61 is a conditional mutual information conditioned on @xmath60 . since @xmath62 as @xmath63 , for large @xmath12 this probability can be approximated as @xmath64 .",
    "this argument suggests that a random code which employs joint typicality decoding can hope to achieve the outer bound if it treats the blocks of coordinates corresponding to different values of @xmath56 differently . with this observation ,",
    "the block markov coding in @xcite can be employed to construct a code with rate achieving the outer bound in the previous section .",
    "fix a source distribution @xmath43 under the restriction of ( [ eqn : src_res ] ) with @xmath28 .",
    "further , assume that @xmath65 .",

    "we will assume that at the end of the transmission of block @xmath128 the destination knows @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "we also assume that the relay knows @xmath132 and consequently knows @xmath133 , since the latter is a function of the former .    at the end of block @xmath15 ,",
    "the following decoding operations are carried out :    1 .   upon receiving the @xmath15th block of outputs @xmath134 , and knowing @xmath135 , the relay isolates those coordinates @xmath136 of the output where @xmath137 as @xmath138 , which is a sequence of @xmath139 symbols .",

    "the destination declares that @xmath161 was sent by the source in the @xmath15th block if and only if there exists a unique @xmath90 such that @xmath162 are jointly typical . again",
    "@xmath163 with arbitrarily small probability of error if @xmath164 and the blocklength @xmath12 is sufficiently large .",
    "although , the destination does not know @xmath124 at the end of block @xmath128 , it calculates an ambiguity set @xmath165 , which consists of the set of all @xmath166 such that @xmath167 @xmath168 are jointly typical . assuming that @xmath135 is correctly decoded",
    ", the destination declares @xmath169 was sent by the source in block @xmath128 if and only if there exists a unique @xmath170 .",
    "like before , @xmath171 with arbitrarily small probability of error if @xmath172 and @xmath12 is sufficiently large .",
    "the validity of the vanishing error probability claims above can be verified by a detailed calculation .",
    "the approach is essentially the same as the one given in @xcite with the exception that strong typicality is needed to ensure the convergence of the ratios @xmath173 and @xmath174 to @xmath175 and @xmath176 , respectively .",
    "the details are omitted here due to page limitation .",
    "as the above decoding operations at the end of block @xmath15 are successful , the destination knows @xmath118 and @xmath124 in addition to what it knew at the end of block @xmath128 .",
    "similarly , the relay knows @xmath119 and hence @xmath177 in addition to its previous knowledge .",
    "thus correct decoding at each step ensures that this recursive decoding scheme can proceed unhindered .    since @xmath108 , from ( [ eqn : achr_21])([eqn : achr_22 ] ) , we have that @xmath18 is an achievable rate for the half - duplex relay channel",

    "with the relay state @xmath56 included as part of the source , we have implicitly assumed that the listen - transmit schedule of the relay depends on the message to be sent .",
    "thus the schedule itself carries information .",
    "this is evidenced by the existence of the term @xmath179 in ( [ eqn : halfach ] ) .",
    "the use of random relay listen - transmit schedules to increase the transmission rate in the half - duplex relay channel was first suggested in @xcite . in @xcite , the block markov coding of @xcite",
    "is directly applied to the vector - valued input at the relay consisting of @xmath42 and @xmath56 . since there is no point of sending information from the source to the relay when the relay is transmitting",
    ", the source should use all its resources to send to the destination .",
    "the vector - valued relay input approach of @xcite is not able to do so as it does not separate the two modes of operation of the half - duplex relay channel . as a result",
    ", it can not achieve capacity .",
    "if we restrict the relay listen - transmit schedule to be deterministic , i.e. , the schedule does not depend on the message to be sent , an argument similar to the one in the previous two sections can be used to show that the capacity of the degraded half - duplex relay channel is given by the bound in ( [ eqn : halfbndfin ] ) with the term @xmath179 removed and @xmath175 and @xmath176 interpreted as the fractions of time the relay transmits and listens , respectively . compared to the random schedule , the loss of fixing the relay listen - transmit schedule is @xmath179 , which is no larger than @xmath68 bit .",
    "block markov coding was proposed in @xcite to achieve the capacity of the gaussian half - duplex relay channel with deterministic relay schedule .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that the capacity can also be achieved using a coding design that treats the received symbols at the destination during the two modes of operation of the half - duplex relay channel as those from a pair of parallel gaussian channels @xcite .",
    "the advantage of the latter approach is that all decoding can be done within a single block .",
    "let @xmath180 be the fraction of time that the relay listens",
    ". then achievable rate of the half - duplex relay channel with deterministic relay listen - transmit schedule can be written as @xmath181 where @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 , and @xmath185 are given in ( [ eqn : halfach ] ) .",
    "a closer inspection of their corresponding mutual information terms reveals an interesting interpretation . as mentioned before ,",
    "the half - duplex relay channel is made up of the bc and ma components .",
    "the rate pair @xmath186 can be viewed as the rate pair achievable over the ( degraded ) bc channel ( c.f .",
    "14.6.2 ) ) , where @xmath187 is the rate of the flow of information from the source to the destination and @xmath184 is the rate of another distinct flow of information to the relay .",
    "similarly the rate pair @xmath188 represents the pair achievable over the ma channel ( c.f .",
    "14.3.1 ) ) , where @xmath183 and @xmath185 are the rates from the source and the relay to the destination , respectively .",
    "since the relay is neither a source nor sink of information , the @xmath189 operator in ( [ eqn : fixed ] ) specifies the max - flow through the relay .",
    "this interpretation suggests another simple way to achieve capacity in the case of physically degraded half - duplex relay channel with deterministic relay listen - transmit schedule :    1 .",
    "divide available time into 2 slots of fractional durations @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively .",
    "the relay listens in the first time slot and transmits in the second one .",
    "2 .   during the first time slot ,",
    "the source broadcasts two distinct flows of information with rates @xmath192 and @xmath193 to the destination and relay , respectively .",
    "both the relay and destination decode the corresponding flows of information at the end of the time slot .",
    "3 .   during the second time slot",
    ", the relay forwards the information that it receives in the first time slot to the destination . simultaneously",
    "the source sends another flow of information of rate @xmath194 to the destination over the ma channel .",
    "the destination decodes the two flows of information at the end of the time slot .",
    "note that this flow - oriented method employs only coding for the bc and ma component channels .",
    "no block markov coding is needed .",
    "compared with the parallel gaussian coding in @xcite , this approach has the advantage that the destination performs independent decoding at the end of the two time slots , without the need of storing the received message in the first time slot for decoding in the second time slot .",
    "this convenient method is applied to the flow optimization design considered in @xcite .",
    "previously the half - duplex relay channel is constructed from the bc and ma components for the two modes of the relay .",
    "two natural questions arises from this construction :    * if the relay can be made to operate in the full - duplex manner , what will be the full - duplex relay channel `` physically '' corresponding to the two components ? * how does this full - duplex channel compared with the half - duplex channel in terms of capacity ?    to address the above two questions , we need to `` construct '' a full - duplex relay channel from the bc and ma components .",
    "one physically reasonable construction is to have the full - duplex relay channel @xmath195 satisfying : @xmath196 for all @xmath38 .",
    "the requirement in ( [ eqn : fdct ] ) clearly states that the constructed full - duplex channel should behave the same as the ma component if we concentrate on the part from the source and relay transmitting to the destination .",
    "similarly , the requirement in ( [ eqn : fdcl ] ) forces the constructed full - duplex channel to act like the bc component if we concentrate on the link from the source to the relay .",
    "we note that many full - duplex relay channels satisfying ( [ eqn : fdct ] ) and ( [ eqn : fdcl ] ) can be constructed .",
    "in particular , physically degraded ( in the sense of @xcite ) relay channels can be constructed in this way .",
    "interestingly , all these physically degraded relay channels so constructed have the same capacity , which depends only on @xmath197 and @xmath198 . however it is possible in general to have the constructed full - duplex channel capacity to be smaller than that of the original half - duplex channel .",
    "this is physically unreasonable and hence implies that we need an additional constraint in the construction above .",
    "it turns out that the following constraint will force the constructed full - duplex channel to have a larger capacity : @xmath199 where @xmath46 is the quiet symbol of the relay mentioned before .",
    "the physical interpretation of this constraint is that when the relay listens , the link from source to the destination is the same that when the relay sends out the quiet symbol .",
    "for half - duplex relay channels that are not physically degraded , like @xcite , the max - flow min - cut bound in ( [ eqn : maxmin ] ) gives the outer bound in ( [ eqn : halfbndout ] ) , which does not coincides with the rate achieved by the decode - forward coding technique in ( [ eqn : halfach ] ) . the decode - forward rate in ( [ eqn : halfach ] )",
    "acts as an inner bound on the capacity .",
    "it is conceivable that the compress - forward approach suggested in @xcite can be applied to obtain another inner bound on the capacity as in @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty of such a development is that the relay has to determine the listen - transmit schedule of the current block from the observed symbols in the previous block , without correctly decoding of the previous message .    when the links among the source , relay , and destination are all gaussian channels , we call the resulting relay channel a _ gaussian _ half - duplex relay channel .",
    "it is clear that such a relay channel is characterized by a gaussian bc channel in the bc mode and a gaussian ma channel in the ma mode .",
    "more precisely , conditioned on the event @xmath200 , @xmath201 and conditioned on the event @xmath202 , @xmath203 where @xmath204 and @xmath205 are independent zero - mean gaussian noise random variables with variances @xmath206 and @xmath207 , respectively . from ( [ eqn : gaussian1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : gaussian2 ] ) , the symbol `` @xmath67 '' acts to both the erasure and quiet symbols described in section  [ sec : model ] . in addition , the restriction in ( [ eqn : fdq ] ) is satisfied .",
    "although this gaussian half - duplex relay channel is not physically degraded in ( [ eqn : gaussian1 ] ) and ( [ eqn : gaussian2 ] ) , @xmath208 , where @xmath209 is another zero - mean gaussian random noise independent of @xmath205 ( needs @xmath210 ) , then the gaussian half - duplex relay channel is physically degraded . ] , the outer bound ( [ eqn : halfbndout ] ) and inner bound ( [ eqn : halfbndfin ] ) still apply , with additional power constraints , @xmath211 and @xmath212 , respectively , on the symbols @xmath213 and @xmath42 for the maximization operation to make sense .",
    "unfortunately , as suggested in @xcite , the maximizing input distributions for both bounds are not gaussian .",
    "finding these maximizing input distributions is an open problem .",
    "when the relay listen - transmit schedule is deterministic , the maximizing input distributions for the outer bound is gaussian and the maximum bound is given ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) in the form of ( [ eqn : fixed ] ) with @xmath214 , @xmath215 , @xmath216 , and @xmath217 , where the maximum value is taken over all @xmath218 . the function @xmath219 .",
    "the block markov coding ( also the parallel gaussian channel ) inner bound is also given ( * ? ? ?",
    "2 ) in the form of ( [ eqn : fixed ] ) with @xmath220 and the other rates remain the same as above .",
    "this form of the bounds suggests once again the use of the flow - oriented coding method described in section  [ sec : randvsfixed ] .",
    "unfortunately , it turns out that neither the rate pair @xmath186 of the outer bound nor that of the inner bound lies in the achievable rate region of the gaussian bc component channel .",
    "however the flow - oriented method may still outperform the decode - forward method in some cases .",
    "we are also unclear about how this method compared with the compress - forward method suggested in @xcite .",
