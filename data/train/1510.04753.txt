    "granular chains consist of closely packed arrays of particles that interact elastically @xcite .",
    "the contact force can be tuned to yield near linear to purely nonlinear responses , and the effective stiffness properties can also be easily changed by modifying the material , geometry , or contact angle of the elements in contact @xcite .",
    "this remarkable tunability has made the topic of granular chains an active research area over the past two decades ( see the reviews @xcite ) .",
    "granular chains have been proposed for numerous applications such as shock and energy absorbing layers  @xcite , actuating devices @xcite , acoustic lenses @xcite , acoustic diodes @xcite and switches @xcite , as well as sound scramblers @xcite .",
    "examples of fundamental studies include solitary waves @xcite and dispersive shocks @xcite .",
    "time - periodic solutions have also been explored @xcite , and constitute one of the main focal points of this article .",
    "time - periodic solutions which are also localized in space ( so - called breathers ) have been explored in a host of nonlinear lattice models during the 25 years since their theoretical inception , as has been summarized , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "examples include optical waveguide arrays or photorefractive crystals  @xcite , micromechanical cantilever arrays  @xcite , josephson - junction ladders  @xcite , layered antiferromagnetic crystals  @xcite , halide - bridged transition metal complexes  @xcite , dynamical models of the dna double strand @xcite and bose - einstein condensates in optical lattices  @xcite . in the context of granular chains ,",
    "breathers have been studied in various settings , including monomers ( chains where all particles are identical ) @xcite , chains with defects @xcite , dimers ( chains with a spatial periodicity of two ) @xcite and trimers and quadrimers ( chains with a spatial periodicity of three and four respectively ) @xcite .",
    "gap effects related to transient behavior of driven dissipative granular chains have also been studied @xcite .",
    "time - periodic solutions of damped - driven granular chains ( including breathers , but not exclusively ) have been explored in monomers @xcite , defect chains @xcite , dimers @xcite and trimers @xcite .    despite the large volume of studies of time - periodic solutions in granular chains ,",
    "there has been very little attention paid to the high amplitude time - periodic solutions that exist in these models , especially from an experimental perspective .",
    "for example , a common theme in the studies of damped - driven granular chains is the transition between low - amplitude time - periodic states to quasi - periodicity or chaos @xcite",
    ". the focus of this article will be on the different vibrational states in damped - driven granular chains . herein , we measure voltage variations related to different force transmission between particles by embedding a piezoelectric sensor connected to a purely resistive load in one of the beads of the chain .",
    "the resulting power is then calculated as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is measured the voltage drop over the resistor which has resistance @xmath2 .",
    "we are particularly interested in states that yield larger values of voltage ( and hence power ) .",
    "we identify various vibrational states and characterize them through experiments , numerical simulations and , in certain parametric regions , theory for a large range of input ( i.e. driving ) frequencies .",
    "while fundamentally interesting in their own right , the spontaneous emergence of such states under harmonically driven excitations could potentially prove promising towards energy harvesting applications . while systems incorporating nonlinearity or multiple modes have been shown to harvest energy more efficiently than ones based on linear oscillators ( see @xcite , but also the books @xcite for a comprehensive treatment of energy harvesting ) , these two concepts have not yet been combined for the purpose of energy harvesting . in this article we demonstrate that combination of nonlinearity and multiple modes of the granular chain lead to the possibility of high energy states for a broad range of input frequencies . in the future , different systems ,",
    "bearing resemblance to granular chains , could be engineered to exploit similar nonlinear phenomena as the one described in this paper for use in energy harvesting applications .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows : in secs .",
    "[ sec : exp ] and [ sec : theory ] we describe the experimental and theoretical set - ups respectively .",
    "the main results are presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : main ] where we demonstrate that the granular chain has the possibility for high energy states for a broad range of input frequencies . in sec .",

    "figure  [ fig : setup ] shows the experimental setup .",
    "the chain consists of 21 identical chrome steel spheres ( see table i for their mechanical properties and dimensions ) .",
    "these spheres are aligned using four polytetrafluoroethylene ( ptfe ) rods to constrain the particles transverse motions while allowing their longitudinal vibrations with minimum friction against the supporting rods .",
    "the ptfe rods are mounted on the upper and lower stainless steel blocks to reduce the vibration effect of the rods ( see the upper inset of fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] ) .",
    "we apply 10 n force to the chain for static pre - compression using a spring and linear stage system  @xcite .",
    "the chain is dynamically excited by two piezo actuators ( piezomechanik pst 150/5/7 vs10 ) in contact with the first and last beads .",
    "a common excitation signal is generated using a function generator ( agilent 33220a ) , and it is sent to each actuator after being amplified through separate amplifiers ( piezomechanik le 150/100 ebw ) as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : setup ] .",
    "this enables us to excite both ends of the chain out - of - phase .",
    "we measure the dynamic responses of the chain using a laser doppler vibrometer ( ldv , polytec ofv-534 ) .",
    "the vibrometer is placed in an automated sliding rail at a slanted angle ( 45@xmath3 ) , collecting the velocity profiles at specific particle spots . in this study ,",
    "the localization and garnering of mechanical energy at the center of the chain is of particular interest .",
    "therefore , besides the non - contact ldv method , we position a contact - based piezoelectric sensor bead at the center of the chain . for this",
    ", we fabricate a custom - made particle that embeds a lead zirconate titanate ( pzt ) disc between two halves of stainless steel spheres as shown in the lower inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ]  @xcite .",
    "the dimensions and properties of the pzt disc are in table i. note that the total mass and contact stiffness of the sensor bead are the same with that of the other beads , such that this bead can be treated as a regular particle in numerical simulations .",
    "the pzt disc is connected with an electronically controlled resistance box ( iet os-260 ) , which is set to 3k@xmath4 in this study .",
    "we measure the voltage applied to the resistor using an external oscilloscope , which can provide us with the information about the harvestable energy amount under simulated vibration conditions . to investigate its energy harvesting performance , we excite and test the granular chain in two different ways .",
    "one approach is that we excite the chain using a single frequency harmonic signal over a span of 0.1s . given the speed of propagating waves in the chain , this is a period long enough to make the system reach a stationary state .",
    "we take the last 0.01s data to characterize the steady state response of the chain at specific frequencies . in this way",
    ", we use harmonic signals with the frequency from 6 khz to 7.89 khz at a 30 hz interval .",
    "the other approach is that in a single round of testing , we dynamically sweep the frequencies from high ( 7.5 khz ) to low ( 6.5 khz ) ranges with 50 hz step . here",
    ", we run each frequency for 0.05s and take the last 0.01s data in each frequency interval . in both experiments ,",
    "the amplitude of the excitation is consistent with @xmath5 .",
    "we perform each test three times to calculate their averages and standard deviations .",
    "[ tab : params ]    .values of the electromechanical parameters .",
    "mechanical properties are taken from nominal numbers available online and provided by vendors  @xcite , and geometrical dimensions are measured . [ cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,^ \" , ]      1=    for certain parameter values , the hamiltonian limit of eq .",
    "( where @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) can be useful towards understanding the full electromechanical system of eq .  .",
    "this connection can be most easily seen by performing a continuation in driving amplitude @xmath8 and fixing all other parameters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nls](a ) an amplitude continuation is shown for various values of the damping coefficient @xmath9 . for small values of @xmath8 and @xmath9",
    "one can see a low amplitude state , ( the near linear state which is `` dictated '' by the actuators ) and two high amplitude nonlinear states that meet and collide in a saddle - node bifurcation at some critical value of the driving amplitude @xmath10 ; see the arrows of fig .",
    "[ fig : nls](a ) and also  @xcite . since @xmath11 ,",
    "the solution at the saddle - node is  as close as possible \" to the corresponding hamiltonian solution . in that same limit ( of @xmath6 and @xmath7 ) the nonlinear schrdinger ( nls ) equation",
    "can be derived from eq .   written in terms of the negative strain variable @xmath12 , @xcite . in particular",
    ", one defines the multiple - scale ansatz , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a small parameter , effectively parameterizing the solution amplitude ( and also its inverse width ) .",
    "the substitution of this ansatz into the equations of motion and equation of the various orders of @xmath15 leads to the dispersion relation @xmath16 , the group velocity relation @xmath17 , and the nonlinear schrdinger equation , @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 while @xmath21 the nls equation is an integrable equation and has several exact solutions , such as the bright or ( the relevant for our setting ) dark soliton  @xcite . for the coefficients corresponding to the taylor expansion of the hertz contact force , see eq .",
    ", the nls equation features a self - defocusing nonlinearity . as such",
    ", the dark soliton is an exact solution of eq .  .",
    "using the dark soliton as the envelope function , we have the following approximation , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the frequency of oscillation , @xmath24 is a fixed but arbitrary parameter and @xmath25 is an arbitrary spatial translation ; see  @xcite for more details .",
    "we seek to maximize how much the bead with the pzt element is squeezed : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the location of the pzt element .",
    "this quantity in the nls approximation becomes : @xmath28 thus , the profile of the squeeze is localized at the center of the chain , see fig .",
    "[ fig : nls](b ) . if we take @xmath27 to be at the center of the chain , and choose the actuation amplitude to correspond to the saddle - node bifurcation ( see e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : nls](a ) ) we will have an analytical approximation , increasingly valid in the limit of @xmath6 and @xmath7 of how much the pzt bead is squeezed . to compute the corresponding voltage",
    ", we can solve the following equation ,    [ eq : emnls ] @xmath29_+^{3/2 }   - k_a(\\delta_1 +   u_m - u_{m+1 } )   - d_{33 } k_a v -    \\frac{m}{2 \\tau } \\dot{u}_m ,     \\hspace{.2cm}\\\\    \\frac{m}{2 } \\ddot{u}_{m+1 } & = & k_a ( \\delta_1 + u_m - u_{m+1 } ) -   \\gamma [ \\delta_{0 } +    y_{m+1}]_+^{3/2 }    + d_{33 } k_a v -    \\frac{m}{2 \\tau } \\dot{u}_{m+1 } ,     \\hspace{.2cm}\\\\    r c(1 - k^2 ) \\ , \\dot{v }   & = & - d_{33 } k_a   r ( \\dot{u}_m - \\dot{u}_{m+1 }   ) -   v \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath30 is given by eq .  .",
    "for out - of - phase actuation in a chain of odd length , we expect the solution to be symmetric about the center bead , and hence we pick @xmath31 in eq .   and @xmath32 ( for an infinite chain we assume @xmath32 is the center ) , which leads to , @xmath33 since @xmath34 , we expand the forcing terms in a taylor series ( see eq .  ) , and then we define @xmath35 , which leads to    [ eq : emnls1 ] @xmath36    which is a damped - driven linear ode which can be solved exactly . while the full solution is cumbersome to express , the leading order term to the steady - state amplitude of the voltage is easily found .",
    "thus , we finally arrive at the following approximation of the amplitude of the voltage ,    [ eq : vmax ] @xmath37    to compute the driving amplitude @xmath8 we made use of eq .   and",
    "the approximation @xmath38 for @xmath39 .",
    "although the approximation   is only valid in the limit of zero damping , it performs fairly well using the experimentally measured dissipation constant of @xmath40 for small values of @xmath41 ( i.e. for those close to the band edge ) , see fig .",
    "[ fig : nls](c ) .",
    "we note that this approximation can only be employed for the special combinations of actuation frequency and drive given by eqs .",
    "- respectively .",
    "hence , it is evident that in the limit where the nls approximation becomes relevant , the voltage between the electrodes of the pzt can not only be numerically computed but also analytically approximated .",
    "we considered a harmonically driven 1d granular chain with an embedded piezoelectric sensor ( a pzt ) at the center of the chain .",
    "vibrational states of the nonlinear system , which were identified by measuring the voltage output of the pzt sensor , were found to exist for much broader range of input frequencies when compared to the linearized counterpart of this system .",
    "the electromechanical model we derived provided good agreement to the experimentally observed values under both static and dynamic driving frequency , although it may be less accurate for large amplitude ( more highly nonlinear ) states .",
    "the electromechanical model provides an insightful description of how the electrical system can affect the dynamics of the mechanical system , and could be useful for future studies in granular chains that utilize pzt sensors to deduce force , without relying on calibration factors .",
    "the nls equation also provided an analytical prediction of the voltage production for certain combinations of driving frequency and amplitude that compared favorably to numerical simulations . while this study focused on out - of - phase boundary excitations",
    ", we suspect that other harmonic excitation conditions ( where e.g. the phase difference between the two driving frequencies is arbitrary ) will yield qualitatively similar results , although the optimal location for the pzt may no longer be the center . thus , an interesting future direction would be to study a chain in which different particles contain a pzt and the chain is subject to various driving boundary excitations ( not necessarily out - of - phase ) . optimizing the relevant mechanism and identifying the relation between optimal voltage output at different sites as a function of phase would certainly be of interest to future work .",
    "we believe this study lays a foundation for future investigations of energy harvesting in spatially extended nonlinear dynamical systems , identifying their capability for more broadband harvesting , but also raising some of their limitations including the scale of the phenomenon and the partial lack of ( numerical ) control of the output of the mechanism for larger amplitudes / high nonlinearities .",
    "while the granular chain itself may not be ideal for energy harvesting purposes , it demonstrates that the combination of multiple modes and nonlinearity can lead to the possibility of different vibrational states ( including high energy ones ) for a broad range of input frequencies .",
