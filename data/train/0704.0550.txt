    "this paper is part of the bocce ( bologna open cluster chemical evolution ) project , described in detail by @xcite . with this project , we intend to derive homogeneous measures of age , distance , reddening and chemical abundance for a large sample of open clusters ( ocs ) , to study the present day properties of the galactic disc and their evolution with time .    as part of this project , we present here a photometric study of the two old ocs king  11 ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) and berkeley  32 ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , located in the second and third galactic quadrants , respectively .    king  11 has been the subject of a few publications in the past . @xcite",
    "obtained a rather shallow colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) using the 0.9 m kpno telescope .",
    "he found it old ( about the same age of m  67 ) and highly reddened , with a distance modulus ( @xmath17 , derived assuming @xmath18(clump)=0.7 mag .",
    "@xcite acquired deep @xmath19 data at the 3.5 m telescope in calar alto on a small field of view ( 2.7@xmath204.3 arcmin@xmath21 ) ; they derived a reddening = 1 , a distance modulus @xmath22 , a metallicity about solar ( with some uncertainty , because different methods produced contrasting answers ) , and an age of 5@xmath231 gyr .",
    "@xcite obtained not perfectly calibrated @xmath0 photometry and measured a difference in magnitude between the main sequence turn - off point and the red clump of @xmath24=2.3 , that translates , using the so - called mai ( morphological age indicator , see @xcite ) into an age of 6.3 gyr . from their recalibration of the @xmath24 - age relation , assuming [ fe / h]=@xmath25 , @xcite infer an age of 5.5 gyr .",
    "note that the bda @xcite indicates a spurious low age for this cluster ( 1.1 gyr ) , directly taken from the @xcite catalogue , whose source is unclear .",
    "finally , @xcite obtained low resolution spectra of 16 bright stars , from which an average cluster radial velocity ( rv ) was computed ( @xmath26 km  s@xmath27 ) .",
    "these spectra were later reanalyzed by @xcite , finding [ fe / h]=@xmath28 ( rms=0.15 ) dex .",
    "be  32 has been photometrically studied by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "be  32 seems to be quite old ( age about 6 gyr ) and moderately metal poor ( [ fe / h ] between -0.2 and -0.5 ) .",
    "we have recently presented the rvs of about 50 stars in be  32 and a preliminary analysis of the photometric data ( * ? ? ? *",
    "hereafter d06 ) based on isochrone fitting and the magnitude of the red clump . in d06",
    "we also discussed the literature related to be  32 available at the time , and we will not repeat it here .",
    "we now refine our determinations , applying the synthetic cmd method , as done for all the clusters in the bocce project .",
    "finally , @xcite presented an analysis of high resolution flames@vlt spectra of 9 red clump giants in be  32 , finding an average metallicity [ fe / h]@xmath29 dex ( rms 0.04 dex ) , in very good agreement with that found by d06 .",

    "the context of this work is the large bocce project ( @xcite ) , devoted to the systematic study of the galactic disc through open clusters .",
    "distance , reddening and physical properties of the open clusters king 11 and be 32 have been explored . to this end , synthetic cmds",
    "have been built and compared with data using both morphological and statistical criteria .",
    "a morphological analysis exploits all the evolutionary phases , but leads to some level of subjectiveness . on the other hand",
    ", a pure statistical treatment can establish the significance for each model ( reducing the subjectiveness of the comparison ) , but is truly selective only in case of very well defined tos .    in order to extract the maximum level of information ,",
    "we have used both approaches : 1 ) we generate synthetic cmds to best reproduce the main cmd features , especially the late evolutionary phases ( rgb , red clump luminosity , sgb ) ; 2 ) to and main sequence are explored by ks test ( lf and colour distribution ) .",
    "the final results come from the intersection of these .    during the analysis , king 11 and be 32",
    "have presented different problems . for king 11 ,",
    "whose metallicity is unknown , the statistical treatment has the advantage to explore very quickly a multidimensional parameter space .",
    "nevertheless , king 11 has a very noisy to , therefore , a morphological analysis plays a key role in refining the results .",
    "on the other hand , be  32 is characterized by well defined to and ms ( and a well defined metallicity ) , and the statistical approach has provided an independent estimate of the parameters .    for king 11 , our analysis has produced the following results : ( 1 ) the fst tracks give the best chance to reproduce the lf , the colour distribution and the morphological constraints ( the clump luminosity , the bottom of the rgb and the rgb colour ) ; ( 2 ) the metallicities z=0.006 , z=0.01 , z=0.02 all produce synthetic @xmath30 cmds whose goodness of fit are indistinguishable but the use of the @xmath31 band permits to select the right cluster metallicity , i.e. z=0.01 ; ( 4 ) the synthetic cmds generated with the fst tracks are consistent with a reddening @xmath32 , a distance modulus between 11.67 and 11.75 , a cluster age between 3.5 and 4.75 gyr ( the best fit is obtained with 1.04 , 11.75 and 4.25 , respectively ) .",
    "our results confirm that king 11 is among the true `` old open cluster '' , contradicting the @xcite value , but in line with all past direct determinations .",
    "for an immediate comparison , table 5 shows our results together with literature ones .",
    "our derived ages are consistent with the @xcite finding ( age @xmath33 gyr ) .",
    "the difference ( our estimates are systematically younger ) may be easily ascribed to the input physics : @xcite adopted the @xcite tracks , characterized by strong core overshooting : although king 11 masses are only marginally affected by this phenomenon , a conspicuous amount of overshooting goes in the direction of rising the estimated age .",
    "a similar age is recovered also by @xcite , but that work is based on a very shallow sample .",
    "@xcite , adopting [ fe / h]=@xmath25 , provide an age of about 5.5 gyr from their recalibration of the relation between @xmath24 , metallicity and age , based on ten clusters .",
    "the large reddening we have found is in good agreement with literature values , in particular with the @xmath34 derived by the @xcite maps .",
    "our choice of metallicity is in good agreement with the one by @xcite and slightly discrepant with the other derivation based on photometry @xcite , which , however , is more uncertain since those authors found discrepant results with different methods .    in the case of",
    "be  32 our cmds constrain fairly well the cluster metallicity .",
    "the bbc tracks for z=0.008 reproduce all the stellar phases in all bands , while other metallicities have problems to simultaneously best fit both the @xmath35 and the @xmath36 diagrams .",
    "this is in perfect agreement with the finding by @xcite , based on high resolution spectra ( [ fe / h]@xmath37 ) .",
    "the best estimate of the age ranges between 5.0 and 5.5 gyr , slightly older than king  11 .",
    "the age derived by d06 with isochrone fitting was 6.3 gyr , consistent with what we find here once we consider the coarseness of the isochrone grid .",
    "slightly older ages ( 6.3 and 6.0 gyr , respectively ) were found also by @xcite and @xcite , while @xcite reach exactly our same conclusion ( 5.2 gyr ) .",
    "in addition , the present data for be 32 suggests a distance modulus @xmath1 , in fair agreement with past studies , and reddening most likely around 0.12 .",
    "the latter is consistent but slightly larger than the @xmath38 we determined in d06 assuming an older age , and slightly smaller than the value @xmath39 quoted by @xcite .",
    "a clearly lower reddening ( @xmath40 ) was found by @xcite , but we recall that their study was based only on two passbands and may be plagued by uncertainties like the ones we found in the case of our analysis of king  11 .",
    "the comparison to the @xcite maps is too uncertain , given the very low latitude of the cluster .",
    "we suggest the possibility of a differential reddening of the order of @xmath410.02 .",
    "we have computed the distances of the two ocs adopting the preferred distance moduli : king  11 has a distance of about 2.2 - 3.4 kpc from the sun and about 9.2 - 10 kpc from the galactic centre ( assuming the sun to be at 8 kpc from the centre ) , with a height above the galactic plane of 253 - 387 pc ; the corresponding values for be  32 are 3.0 - 3.3 kpc , 10.7 - 11 kpc , and 231 - 254 pc , respectively .",
    "neither cluster is far enough from the galactic centre to be of relevance in the current debate about the metallicity distribution in the outer disc .",
    "however , both contribute to enlarge the still smallish number of old ocs and their metallicity ( specially once that of king  11 is confirmed by dedicated high resolution spectroscopy studies ) will be important in defining the ( possible ) variation of the radial metallicity distribution over the galactic disc lifetime .",
    "the king 11 data reduction was performed by roberto gualandi of the loiano telescope staff .",
