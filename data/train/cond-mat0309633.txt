    "metamagnetic transitions are ubiquitous in nature",
    ". we can find them in pure magnets , in boson systems , in spin density wave systems , and in doped antiferromagnets .    when placed in a magnetic field",
    "many magnetic materials undergo first - order phase transitions .",
    "these materials are called metamagnets .",
    "two of the best studied magnetic materials exhibiting metamagnetic transitions are mnf@xmath7 and fecl@xmath7 .",
    "@xcite in fecl@xmath7 there is a first - order transition from an antiferromagnetic ( af ) to a paramagnetic ( p ) state , and in mnf@xmath7 there is a first - order transition from an af to a spin - flop ( sf ) state ( see figure [ f : angle ] , panel @xmath8 , for a schematic idea on the spin configurations ) .",
    "in addition to the metamagnetic transitions above mentioned , these materials also undergo second - order phase transitions .",
    "the way the second- and first - order transition lines touch each other introduces different types of critical points . in mnf@xmath7 and fecl@xmath7",
    "there is a bicritical and a tricritical point , respectively . some materials , as gdalo@xmath9",
    ", @xcite can present different types of critical points depending on the orientation of the magnetic field .    from the theoretical point of view , and as early as 1936 , nel predicted a first order magnetic transition for an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a magnetic field .",
    "@xcite this metamagnetic transition was named spin - flop transition .",
    "improvements of nel s results were achieved using green s functions and holstein - primakov bosons .",
    "@xcite later , a scaling theory for bicritical points , based on a renormalization group analysis was introduced.@xcite more recently , a zero - temperature spin - flop transition in square and cubic lattices was studied , using exact diagonalization , @xcite and the sse monte carlo method.@xcite the finite temperature study of the model phase diagram , using exact ( numerical ) methods was done recently , but for the two dimensional case only , and in the context of hard core bosons.@xcite ( the three dimensional case , at finite temperatures , was also studied.@xcite )    the exact mapping between hard - core bosons with nearest neighbor interaction and the spin 1/2 anisotropic heisenberg model,@xcite permits to obtain results for both physical systems , from the study of one of them alone.@xcite in the boson language , the antiferromagnetic and spin flop phases correspond to a mott insulator phase ( a solid phase ) , where the bosons are locked at the lattice sites by the nearest neighbor repulsion , and to the super - fluid phase , respectively .",
    "the observation of the mott insulator to super - fluid transition ( and vice versa ) in a bose - einstein condensate of @xmath10rb atoms confined by an optical trap,@xcite gave an enormous boost to the research , both theoretical and experimental , in this field.@xcite the effect of disorder in the phase diagram of the two dimensional boson - hubbard system has been studied as well.@xcite    also in doped magnetic materials , such as in la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 , metamagnetic transitions have been observed.@xcite both in pure la@xmath11cuo@xmath6 and in lightly doped la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 the spin flop transition has its origin in the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction . although some theoretical study of this transition has been done in the past for pure la@xmath11cuo@xmath6,@xcite its study in doped la@xmath4sr@xmath5cuo@xmath6 has not been pursued to our knowledge .",
    "the spin wave spectrum for doped la@xmath11cuo@xmath6 was consider ivanov _",
    "et al._.@xcite this motivated us to carry general studies of metamagnetic transitions in anisotropic doped antiferromagnets .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , the only work dealing with metamagnetic transitions in strong - correlated electrons was done in the context of the hubbard model .",
    "@xcite    the paper is organized as follows : in section [ s : model ] , we introduce the model and the possible spin phases that may exist in the system ; in section [ s : phase ] , the zero- and finite - temperature phase - diagrams of the system are introduced and discussed , together with the effect of doping on the critical fields and on the spin - flop angle ; in section [ s : char ] the metallic sf phase is characterized both in terms of their magnetic and transport properties .",
    "our starting point is a simple generalization of the usual @xmath12 model in three dimensions , where an anisotropic exchange term , of strength @xmath13 , in included @xmath14 in the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) , @xmath15 and @xmath16 stand for the lattice vectors connecting all nearest and second - nearest neighbors sites of site @xmath17 in a 3d cubic lattice , respectively ; the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 stand for the hopping integrals connecting all nearest and second - nearest neighbors sites , respectively , @xmath3 stands for the magnetic field and @xmath20 for the chemical potential .",
    "the density of electrons is defined as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the total number of electrons and @xmath23 is the number of lattice sites . since",
    "our calculations will be performed at electronic densities close to @xmath24 it is convenient for latter use to introduce the doping of holes as @xmath25 .",
    "it is a characteristic of @xmath26 models ( we are referring here to class of models ) that only one electron at the most can exist at each lattice site .",
    "we enforce this constraint using a slave boson representation for the @xmath27 operators .",
    "@xcite in this representation we have @xmath28 and @xmath29 , where @xmath30 are the usual pauli matrices . at each lattice site",
    "the total number of bosons and fermions is equal to one , and we have the constraint @xmath31 . in what follows , we shall consider that all bosons have condensed into the lowest energy state , and introduce @xmath32 , where @xmath33 corresponds , for zero and moderate temperatures ( see finite temperature discussion ) , to the doping introduced above .    in order to introduce a mean field hamiltonian suitable for the study of metamagnetic transitions we consider two sub - lattices , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , such that in each sub - lattice the spins are oriented as shown in fig .",

    "the spin averages of all these configurations , in sub - lattices @xmath34 and @xmath35 , are given by @xmath43 note that we consider the magnitude of the average value of the spin to be different at the two sub lattices .",
    "this is needed because the magnetic field induces a certain amount of ferrimagnetism in the system .",
    "the above phases are commensurate with the lattice , but it is well known that the isotropic @xmath26 model supports spiral order in the @xmath44 plane with a momentum vector @xmath45 incommensurate with the lattice .",
