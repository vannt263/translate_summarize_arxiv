    "this third and last part of the work on generalized poisson - kac ( gpk ) processes and their physical applications extends the analysis developed in parts i and ii @xcite , developing the generalization of gpk theory to a broad spectrum of stochastic phenomenologies . with respect to the theory developed in @xcite , two lines of attack",
    "characterize this extension : ( i ) the inclusion of nonlinearities , and ( ii ) the extension to a continuum of states .",
    "nonlinearities can be treated in two different ways .",
    "the first class of nonlinear models assumes that the state ( position ) variable @xmath0 can influence the basic parameters characterizing stochastic gpk perturbations . in the case of gpk perturbations",
    ", this reflects into the functional dependence of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 on @xmath0 . in the case of a position dependent system of stochastic velocities , i.e , @xmath4",
    ", gpk models correspond to nonlinear langevin equations @xcite , since the latter provide the kac limit ( in the stratonovich interpretation of the stochastic integral ) for this class of systems .",
    "the functional dependence of the transition rates @xmath5 , or of the entries of the transition probability matrix @xmath6 on @xmath0 , provides new phenomena , as it emerges from the analysis of their kac limits .",
    "the second way to include nonlinearities , analogous to the mckean approach to langevin equations @xcite leads to gpk microdynamic equations which depend on the statistical characterization of the process itself ( in the present case , the system of partial probability density functions @xmath7 ) .",
    "this leads to the concept of nonlinear fokker - planck - kac equation ( this diction stems from the langevin counterpart @xcite ) , the dynamic properties of which can be extremely rich .",
    "the extension from a discrete number @xmath8 of states to a continuum of stochastic states is fairly straightforward within the formalism developed in part i ( see also the discussion in part i on the multidichotomic approach ) .",
    "moreover , the coupling of nonlinear effects with a continuum of stochastic states permits to derive the classical nonlinear boltzmann equation of the kinetic theory of gases @xcite within the gpk formalism . this result deserves particular attention as it shows , unambiguously , that the boltzmann equation admits a fully stochastic explanation . in some sense , this result completes the original kac s program in kinetic theory @xcite , originated from the article @xcite aimed at providing an extended markov model for interpreting the celebrated boltzmann equation of kinetic theory . for a discussion on extended markov models",
    "see @xcite .    finally , the article outlines the bridge between the stochastic description of particle microdynamics based on gpk equations , and transport theory of continuous media .",
    "this connection is developed with the aid of some classical problems . in developing a transport theory from gpk microdynamics",
    "the role of the primitive statistical formulation of gpk processes , based on the system of partial probability densities @xmath7 , clearly emerges ( for a discussion see also section 2 in part i ) , and it is mapped into a corresponding system of partial concentrations / velocity fields .",
    "this part of the article is of primary interest in extended thermodynamic theories of irreversible processes @xcite , as it provides a novel way to develop these theories enforcing the assumption of finite propagation velocity for thermodynamic processes , and overcoming the intrinsic limitations of models based on the higher - dimensional cattaneo equation ( see part i for details ) .",
    "the article is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec_2 ] develops the extensions of gpk models ( nonlinearity , continuum of stochastic states ) , presenting for each class of models a physical example .",
    "section [ sec_3 ] derives the connection ( equivalence ) between a nonlinear gpk process admitting a continuum of stochastic states and the boltzmann equation , discussing some implications of this result .",
    "section [ sec_4 ] addresses the connection between gpk microdynamics and the associated transport formalism in continua by considering several problems ranging from dynamo theory @xcite to mass and momentum balances , including a brief description of chemical reactions .",
    "the theory of gpk processes can be generalized in several different directions that provide , from one hand , a valuable system of stochastic modeling tools of increasing complexity and , from the other hand , the possibility of interpreting a broader physical phenomenology . in the remainder of this section",
    "we introduce the various generalizations by considering first one - dimensional poisson - kac processes , and subsequently extending the theory to gpk processes .      in order to define nonlinear",

    "but it is rather intuitive , that the results obtained on the connections between kinetic theory and nfpk models admit powerful implications , not only from a theoretical and thermodynamic point of view , but also in practical applications .",
    "the idea of developing a fully stochastic molecular simulator based on nfpk dynamics is not only intriguing , but also feasible and potentially computationally advantageous with respect to the existing methods .",
    "further studies will clarify and quantify the correctness of this possibility .",
    "what is also interesting to observe is that the physical concept of collision amongst molecules corresponds , in the continuous gpk setting , to a markovian recombination amongst the partial probability waves @xmath402 , induced by the choice of the velocity @xmath265 as the stochastic vector - valued variable parametrizing the states of the cgpk process .",
    "apart from this result , gpk theory provides a simple and tractable class of processes that overcome the intrinsic problems of wiener - driven stochastic models in describing the physical reality ( infinite propagation velocity ) , and permits to derive out of them new classes of transport equations in the hydrodynamic ( continuum ) limit .",
    "the main qualitative difference between wiener - driven and gpk stochastic models resides in the _ regularity issue _ : the trajectory of gpk processes , for finite values of @xmath403 and @xmath404 , are , with probability @xmath85 , almost everywhere smooth curves of time , possessing fractal dimension @xmath405 , and local hlder exponent @xmath85 . out of it ,",
    "finite propagation velocity follows .",
    "moreover , the kac - limit property provides the natural connection between gpk theory and the classical stochastic formulation of microdynamics based on brownian motion and wiener - driven langevin equations .",
    "this connection is not only related to the kac limit for @xmath357 , keeping fixed the nominal diffusivity @xmath406 , but also as an emergent property in the long - time regime .",
    "this justifies while brownian features can be observed at time - scales much larger than the characteristic recombination scale @xmath407 .",
    "the asymptotic properties of gpk processes represent a bridge between gpk theory and the statistical physics based on brownian motion and wiener - driven processes that , as said , can be regarded as an emergent feature for long timescales .      * gpk processes , once extended to space - time stochastic perturbations , provide a valuable tool for approaching , on a rigorous but save way ( as singularity issues are concerned ) , spatio - temporal stochastic dynamics and field - theoretical models ( i.e. , spde ) driven by stochastic perturbations .",
    "we have outlined several simple linear examples in part ii , and the same approach can be extended to work out nonlinear models such as burgers equations , kpz model , @xmath408-field stochastic quantization , etc .",
    "* the finite propagation velocity of gpk provides a safeguard in the extension of gpk processes to the relativistic case @xcite .",
    "* trajectory regularity , characterizing gpk processes , substantially simplifies all the subtleties and technicalities of stochastic ( ito , stratonovich , klimontovich etc . ) calculus , as reduces it to the simplest possible form , namely that of riemann - stieltjes integrals .",
    "there is another issue , mentioned throughout this work , that deserves further attention , as it marks a conceptual difference between wiener - driven langevin equations and the corresponding stochastic models driven by gpk processes .",
    "consider a langevin equation driven by a wiener forcing on the state variable @xmath73 .",
    "the wiener forcing expresses in a lumped , coarse - grained way , a manifold of small - scale perturbations resulting from the microscopic interactions , internal to the system , and from the interactions with the surrounding . as a result",
    ", the associated forward fokker - planck equation defines the evolution of the probability density function in which there is no further reference on the state of the stochastic perturbation : this makes this class of models strictly markovian .",
    "conversely , in the corresponding gpk case , the statistical description of the process still involves information about the stochastic perturbation : for this reason a system of partial probability densities , @xmath7 in the discrete case , @xmath409 , @xmath410 in the cgpk case , is required to describe the statistical evolution of the system .",
    "the fact that the statistical description of the process keeps memory of the state of the stochastic perturbation , so that system dynamics and stochastic perturbations can not be decoupled , other than in the kac limit , is the physical origin of the trajectory regularity of gpk processes .",
    "consequently , gpk processes are not strictly markovian , which respect to the overall probability density function @xmath411 , but an extended markovian property can be still established with respect to the complete probabilistic description accounting also for the state of the stochastic perturbation @xcite .    the consequence of this property , as regards the transport equations in the hydrodynamic limit , is evident : a system driven by gpk fluctuations is fully described in the hydrodynamic limit by a family of partial mass and momentum densities @xmath412 , @xmath413 , and similarly for the other thermodynamic quantities , consistently with the retained information on the state of the stochastic perturbation .",
    "this , namely the partial - wave approach towards the coarse - graining of the microdynamic equation of motion , will be analyzed in future works . in any case",
    ", it represents a novel and promising alternative to the existing higher - moment expansions , that starting from the well - known grad s 13-moment approach @xcite , have been developed in the current literature on kinetic theory and statistical mechanics .",
    "all the higher - moment expansions , beyond the classical 5-mode approach associated with the collisional invariants , suffer the intrinsic _ vulnus _ , as regards the lack of positivity , that can be easily interpreted within the pawula theorem @xcite .",
    "in this framework , the use of gpk theory , and of its implications in the definition of the hydrodynamic limit , represents not only a new way for approaching the coarse - graining of microscopic dynamics towards the hydrodynamic equations for a continuum , but also the stochastic background for the development of a rigorous , stochastically consistent , formulation of the extended thermodynamic theories of irreversible processes , initiated with the works by mller and ruggieri , and subsequently elaborated by jou , lebon , casas - vazquez and many others , aimed at generalizing the classical de - groot mazur theory of irreversible processes , by introducing a more general definition of the thermodynamic state variables out of equilibrium in order to include the contribution of the fluxes .",
