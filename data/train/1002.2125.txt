    "neptune mass extrasolar planets around main sequence stars were first detected five years ago . since then , 27 planets with a projected mass lower than 25 earth masses have been discovered , the lightest one having a projected mass of 1.94  m@xmath2 . among these objects ,",
    "17 have a semi  major axis smaller than 0.1  astronomical unit ( au ) .",
    "they are called hot neptunes or hot super  earths .",
    "so far , two multiple planet systems with at least two such objects have been observed .",
    "one of them is a four planet system around the m  dwarf gj  581 ( bonfils et al .",
    "2005 , udry et al .",
    "2007 , mayor et al .",
    "the projected masses of the planets are 1.9 , 15.6 , 5.4 and 7.1  m@xmath2 and the periods are 3.15 , 5.37 , 12.93 and 66.8 days , respectively .",
    "note that although the eccentricities of the two innermost planets are compatible with zero , those of the next outermost and outermost planets are 0.16 and 0.18 respectively .",
    "the second multiple system which we shall focus upon in this paper is that around the k  dwarf hd  40307 ( mayor et al .",
    "it comprises three planets with projected masses of 4.2 , 6.9 and 9.1  m@xmath2 and periods of 4.31 , 9.62 and 20.46 days , respectively .",
    "the eccentricities are all compatible with zero .",
    "if we label the planets in a system with successive integers starting from the innermost labelled , 1 , and moving outwards , then , in the system gl  581 , the ratio of the periods of planets 2 and 1 is 2.41 and that of the periods of planets 3 and 2 is 1.70 .",
    "we note that these numbers depart from 5/2 and 5/3 only by 4% and 2% , respectively.a in the hd  40307 system , the ratio of the periods of planets 2 and 1 is 2.23 and that of planets 3 and 2 is 2.13 , which depart from 2 by 11.5% and 6.5% , respectively .",
    "because departure from exact mean motion resonances in these systems is significant , the importance of resonances for their dynamical evolution has been ruled out ( mayor et al .",

    "migration due to tidal interaction with the disc is probably the mechanism by which planets end up on short period orbits , as _ in situ _ formation requires very massive discs ( e.g. , raymond et al .",
    "planet scatterings may also lead to short period orbits , but only when tidal circularization is efficient . according to kennedy & kenyon ( 2008 ) ,",
    "scatterings are not a likely way of producing hot super ",
    "earths , because of the long circularization timescales involved . in a previous paper ( terquem & papaloizou 2007 , see also brunini & cionco 2005 ) , we proposed a scenario for forming hot super ",
    "earths on near commensurable orbits , in which a population of cores that assembled at some distance from the central star migrated inwards due to tidal interaction with the disc while merging on their way in .",
    "we found that evolution of an ensemble of cores in a disc almost always led to a system of a few planets , with masses that depended on the total initial mass of the system , on short period orbits with mean motions that frequently exhibited near commensurabilities and , for long enough tidal circularization times , apsidal lines that were locked together . starting with a population of 10 to 25 planets of 0.1 or 1  m@xmath3",
    ", we ended up with typically between two and five planets with masses of a few tenths of an earth mass or a few earth masses inside the disc inner edge .",
    "interaction with the central star led to the initiation of tidal circularization of the orbits which , together with possible close scatterings and final mergers , tended to disrupt mean  motion resonances that were established during the migration phase .",
    "the system , however , often remained in a configuration in which the orbital periods were close to commensurability .",
    "apsidal locking of the orbits , if established during migration , was often maintained through the action of these processes .",
    "this scenario has been questioned ( mayor et al .",
    "2009a , 2009b ) because the multiple planet systems of hot super  earths detected so far do not exhibit close enough mean motion commensurabilities . in this paper",
    ", we argue that _ the system around hd  40307 does actually exhibit the effects of resonances _ through secular effects produced by the action of the resonant angles coupled with the action of tides from the central star , and that such a configuration could be produced if the system formed as described in terquem & papaloizou ( 2007 ) , but with the addition of relatively small perturbations to the orbits arising from close encounters or collisions after the system enters the disc inner cavity .",
    "the reason that what are regarded as resonant effects can arise even when departures from strict commensurability are apparently large is that tidal circularization produces small eccentricities which , for first order resonances , can be consistent with resonant angle libration under those conditions ( see murray & dermott 1999 ) .",
    "we consider in detail the evolution of this system and other putative similar systems with scaled masses and orbital periods after they form a strict three planet laplace resonance as a result of convergent inward orbital migration .",
    "we go on to consider the onset of tidal circularization and how it leads to a separation of the semi - major axes and consequent increasing departure from commensurability .",
    "we find that if the strict laplace resonance is broken by a fairly small relative perturbation corresponding to a few parts in a thousand , continuing evolution in a modified form of the three planet resonance could in principle in the case of hd  40307 lead to a system like the observed one .",
    "however , this would require masses significantly larger than the minimum estimates and possibly unrealistically efficient tidal dissipation with the tidal dissipation parameter @xmath4 however , weaker tidal effects could be responsible for some of the deviation from strict commensurability , with the rest being produced by a larger perturbation resulting from the processes mentioned above inducing eccentricities of the order @xmath5 note however that tidal evolution could play a more significant role in similar systems with shorter orbital periods .    in section  [ sec :",
    "model ] , we describe the numerical model we use to simulate the evolution of a system of three planets migrating in a disc and evolving under the tidal interaction with the star after they enter the disc inner cavity . in section  [ sec : hd40307 ] , we simulate the system around hd  40307 using either the minimum or twice the minimum masses for the planets under varying assumptions about initial eccentricities and the strength of the tidal interaction .",
    "we show that three of the four possible resonant angles associated with 2:1 commensurabilities either librate or have long term time averages , indicating evolution of the system towards a resonant state driven by the tidal influence of the star .    in a related appendix",
    ", we give a semi  analytic model for a system in a three planet resonance undergoing circularization with departures from strict mean motion commensurabilities .",
    "we note in passing that the discussion may also be applied to a two planet system near a 2:1 resonance .",
    "we show that the departure from commensurability increases with time being @xmath6 and derive an expression for the timescale required to attain a given departure that can be used to interpret extrapolate from and generalize the numerical simulations .",
    "in section  [ sec : simulations ] , we present results of numerical simulations of a three planet system migrating in a disc , establishing a 4:2:1 laplace like resonance , and evolving under tidal effects induced by the star after entering the disc inner cavity . as expected ,",
    "as the orbits are being tidally circularized , the planets move away from exact commensurabilites , and the period ratios of the outer and inner pairs of planets increases .",
    "the system is still resonant in the sense that some of the resonant angles continue to librate . to get a larger period ratio for the inner pair of planets , as in hd  40307 ,",
    "some disruption of this laplace resonant state is needed . in our simulations , this is achieved by applying an impulse ( that could result from an encounter or collision ) to the system .",
    "this leads to departures from exact commensurabilites of the form seen in hd  40307 while still retaining libration of three of the four resonant angles .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : discussion ] we discuss and summarize our results .",
    "the model we use has been described in terquem & papaloizou ( 2007 ) .",
    "we recall here the main features .",
    "we consider a system consisting of a primary star and n  planets embedded in a gaseous disc surrounding it ( for hd  40307 , n = 3 ) .",
    "the planets undergo gravitational interaction with each other and the star and are acted on by tidal forces from the disc and the star .",
    "the evolution of the system is studied by means of the solution of @xmath7body problems , in which the tidal interactions are included as dissipative forces .",
    "the equations of motion are : @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 denote the mass of the central star , that of planet  @xmath12 and the position vector of planet @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "the acceleration of the coordinate system based on the central star ( indirect term ) is : @xmath13    and that due to tidal interaction with the disc and/or the star is dealt with through the addition of extra forces as in papaloizou  & larwood  ( 2000 ) : @xmath14    where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the timescales over which , respectively , the angular momentum , the eccentricity and the inclination with respect to the unit normal @xmath18 to the assumed fixed gas disc midplane change .",
    "evolution of the angular momentum and inclination is due to tidal interaction with the disc , whereas evolution of the eccentricity occurs due to both tidal interaction with the disc and the star .",
    "we have : @xmath19    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the contribution from the disc and tides raised by the star , respectively .",
    "relativistic effects are included through @xmath22 ( see papaloizou & terquem 2001 ) .",
    "the way it is implemented , interaction with the star does not modify the angular momentum of a single orbit ( the orbital decay timescale due to tidal interaction with the star , which as indicated below is estimated to be much longer than the circularization timescale , has been ignored here ) .",
    "however , in the formulation above , eccentricity damping causes radial velocity damping , which results in energy loss at constant angular momentum . as a consequence",
    ", both the semi  major axis and eccentricity are reduced together ( at least for a single planet ) .",
    "the circularization timescale due to tidal interaction with the star can be estimated , from expressions given by goldreich  & soter ( 1966 ) , to be : @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the semi ",
    "major axis of planet  @xmath25 here we have adopted a mass density of 1  g  @xmath26 for the planets ( uncertainties in this quantity could be incorporated into a redefinition of @xmath27 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the tidal dissipation function and @xmath30 is the love number .",
    "equation ( [ teccs ] ) applies to the situation where tides raised by the central star are dissipated in the planet in the limit of small eccentricity which is appropriate here .",
    "tides raised by the planet in the star have been estimated to be unimportant for the low mass planets of interest ( eg .",
    "barnes et al 2009 ) . for solar system planets in the terrestrial mass range ,",
    "goldreich & soter ( 1966 ) give estimates for @xmath29 in the range 10500 and @xmath31 , which correspond to @xmath27 in the range 502500 .",
    "of course this parameter must be regarded as being very uncertain for extrasolar planets , and accordingly we have considered values of @xmath27 in the range @xmath32 in this paper . for an earth mass planet at 0.05  au and @xmath33 , we get @xmath34  years .",
    "this indicates that circularization processes will be important for close in extrasolar planets in this mass range over the entire range of @xmath27 considered .",
    "but note that although circularization operates on each orbit according to equation ( [ teccs ] ) , because the planets interact they may enter into a decay mode with a decay timescale that is not straightforwardly estimated as above ( see section [ initecc ] ) .",
    "nonetheless the above estimate is found to be indicative .",
    "we have pointed out above that , in our formulation , tidal interaction with the star does not change the angular momentum of a single orbit but modifies the semi  major axis .",
    "the physical basis for this is that the planets rapidly attain pseudo - synchronization ( e.g. , ivanov & papaloizou 2007 ) , after which they can not store significant angular momentum changes through modifying their intrinsic angular momenta .",
    "we restrict consideration for the moment to a single planet .",
    "since the orbital angular momentum is conserved , @xmath35 for small eccentricities , where @xmath36 is the eccentricity of the planet we consider . therefore @xmath24 changes only by about 5  percent in @xmath37  years for @xmath38 @xmath39  m@xmath2 and @xmath40 however , larger changes may occur for larger planet masses .",
    "we investigate the dependence of this form of evolution on the system configuration in detail below .",
    "finally we remark that all the simulation results reported here were obtained assuming that @xmath27 is the same for all the planets .",
    "however , tests were carried out with this assumption relaxed and these are alluded to in section [ sec : simulations ] below .      in the local linear treatment of type  i migration ( e.g. , tanaka et al .",
    "2002 ) , if the planet is not in contact with the disc , there is no interaction between them so that @xmath15 , @xmath20 and @xmath17 are taken to be infinite .",
    "when the planet is in contact with the disc , disc  planet interactions occur leading to orbital migration as well as eccentricity and inclination damping ( e.g. , ward  1997 ) . in that case , away from the disc edge , for some simulations we have adopted : @xmath41 \\left [ 1- \\left ( \\frac { e_i } { 1.1 h / r}\\right)^4 \\right]^{-1 } \\ ; \\left ( \\frac{h / r}{0.05 } \\right)^2 \\ ; \\frac{{\\rm m}_\\odot}{m_d } \\ ; \\frac{{\\rm m}_\\oplus}{m_i } \\ ; \\frac{a_i}{{\\rm 1~au } } \\ ; \\ ; \\ ; { \\rm years } , \\label{tm}\\ ] ] @xmath42 \\ ; \\left ( \\frac{h / r}{0.05 } \\right)^4 \\ ; \\frac{{\\rm m}_\\odot}{m_d } \\ ;",

    "here @xmath36 is the eccentricity of planet  @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the disc aspect ratio and @xmath47 is the disc mass contained within 5  au .",
    "we have assumed here that the disc surface mass density varies like @xmath48 .",
    "for a 1  earth mass planet on a quasi ",
    "circular orbit at 1  au , we get @xmath49  yr and @xmath50  yr for @xmath51  m@xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the timescales given by equations  ( [ tm ] ) and  ( [ te ] ) can be used not only for small values of @xmath36 , but also for eccentricities larger than @xmath46 .",
    "we have also carried out simulations with @xmath15 and @xmath20 taken to be constants and thus independent of eccentricity .",
    "the commensurabilities that are formed in the system depend on the ratio of the migration rate to the orbital frequency , with commensurabilities of low order and low degree forming when this ratio is small .",
    "therefore , using equations  ( [ tm ] ) and  ( [ te ] ) or constant timescales give very similar results provided the eccentricity damping is ultimately effective and the magnitudes of the migration rates are comparable in both cases at zero eccentricity .",
    "the type  i migration rates to be used are uncertain even when the surface density is known , largely because of uncertainties regarding the effectiveness of coorbital torques ( e.g. , paardekooper & melema 2006 , pardekooper & papaloizou 2008 , 2009 ) . in this context there are indications from modelling the observational data that the adopted type i migration rate should be significantly below that predicted by ( [ tm ] ) and  ( [ te ] ) or tanaka et al ( 2002 ) ( see schlaufman et al 2009 ) . hence we explore a range of possible values .",

    "the motivation for this is that it is expected that tidal circularization will lead to a state closely approaching this provided that initial eccentricities are not so large as to disrupt the system . in order to explore this aspect in more detail ,",
    "we have carried out a number of simulations which started with non circular orbits .",
    "we have explored initial eccentricities @xmath90 and found that the system enters into an eccentricity decay mode that causes the system to evolve towards the state we found starting from circular orbits in which three of the resonant angles move towards libration with non zero values for the running time averages of their cosines .    in order to illustrate this we describe here results obtained when",
    "just one of the planets was started with a non zero eccentricity for various values of @xmath91 to initiate the system it was started as for the simulation illustrated in figure [ figjp1 ] but with one of the planets set at pericentre in an orbit with the same angular momentum but with an eccentricity @xmath92 this is equivalent to transfer to a less tightly bound orbit with the original specific angular momentum , but with the specific energy multiplied by @xmath93 in all cases the eccentricities of the planets become coupled and start to decay .",
    "after a while the system attains a slow decay mode for which , in a time average sense , the eccentricities are in an approximately constant ratio such that @xmath94 and @xmath95    fig .",
    "[ figjp6 ] illustrates the evolution of the eccentricities and running time averages of the cosines of the resonant angles for minimum mass simulations with @xmath96 cases for which the innermost , middle and outermost planet respectively had an initial eccentricity are shown . for comparison a case with twice the minimum masses and for which the outermost planet was started with a non zero eccentricity",
    "is also shown .",
    "the evolution of all of these systems was as described above .",
    "however , the introduction of the initial eccentricity while conserving the angular momentum of the system causes the semi - major axes and hence the period ratios in the system to change .",
    "this evolution involves energy dissipation at fixed angular momentum and thus the system must spread radially as for an accretion disc ( eg .",
    "lynden - bell & pringle 1974 ) .",
    "this causes the period ratios to increase ( see fig . [ figjp7 ] ) .",
    "when this happens the system attains period ratios that differ from the original ones .",
    "however , this is easily compensated for by starting with appropriately shifted initial conditions .",
    "the important point is that we get the same type of evolution independently of such shifts .",
    "[ figjp7 ] shows that the largest shift occurs when the outermost planet starts with an initial eccentricity .",
    "the period ratio of the innermost pair shifts from @xmath56 to @xmath97 a consequence of this is that the forced eccentricity of the innermost planet is @xmath98 smaller in this case than in the case where the inner planet started with a non zero eccentricity ( see fig .",
    "[ figjp6 ] ) .",
    "we remark that the same evolution is obtained when the masses are increased by a factor of two except that the ultimate eccentricities are a factor between @xmath99 and @xmath100 larger .",
    "the above trends are in qualitative agreement with a simplified discussion of the resonant interaction between the planets that we give in appendix a even though only two of the resonant angles @xmath76 and @xmath77 are found to be librating at this point with @xmath86 having a non zero time average of relatively small magnitude .",
    "finally we have checked that changing @xmath27 gives the same form of solution but with an evolutionary time that scales with @xmath88 results for @xmath89 and @xmath75 that confirm this view when compared with results already described for @xmath57 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ figjp8 ] . however , practical considerations mean that runs with large @xmath27 can not be followed to libration of the resonant angles .",
    "nonetheless when @xmath101 @xmath85 and @xmath83 begin to attain non zero running means at the end of simulations with minimum masses after @xmath102 this indicates that resonance could be effectively entered for @xmath103 within the lifetime of such systems .",
    "these results taken together suggest that the planets may be undergoing circularization in a three planet resonance .",
    "as the circularization process involves energy dissipation at fixed angular momentum , the system must spread increasing the period ratios of neighbouring planets .",
    "although this means an increasing departure from strict commensurability , resonant angles remain librating or circulating in such a way as to enable the required redistribution of angular momentum to take place . a simple model illustrating how this works is given in appendix a. the amount of spreading and increase in the period ratios that can take place in a given time depends on @xmath88 we investigate this in the context of a migration scenario for producing the configuration below .",
    "simulations incorporating migration indicate that the planets were likely to have been in a strict laplace resonance with all four angles librating . however , if this persists the period ratios would increase maintaining a larger departure from commensurability for the outer pair than the inner pair in disagreement with observations .",
    "thus some perturbation event must have disrupted this resonance enabling the planets to continue circularizing with the correct period ratio relationships . as we have seen above ,",
    "giving one of the planets a relatively small eccentricity can produce significant changes to the period ratios .    to investigate this scenario ,",
    "we now describe simulations of systems of three  planets migrating inwards in a disc that set up a laplace resonance .",
    "we go on to study the evolution following from its disruption as the result of a perturbation applied once the planets have decoupled from the disc .",
    "in all the runs we have performed , the planets converge on each other forming a three planet 4:2:1 resonance , and migrate in locked in that configuration . whether the resonance can be maintained all the way down to the disc inner cavity depends on how fast the migration is .",
    "there is a tendency for the 4:2:1 resonance to be stable for slow migration rates but to be disrupted , with the appearance of higher order resonances once the migration rate becomes sufficiently fast .",
    "however , the evolution is difficult to predict precisely , as the transition from the 4:2:1 resonance to higher order resonances happens through an instability which appears to be extended in time and chaotic .",
    "small changes to the model parameters in this regime may affect whether this instability occurs or not within a given time interval .",
    "similar phenomena have been seen in two planet resonant migration where a sequence of resonances can be formed , maintained and subsequently disrupted in turn ( see papaloizou & szuszkiewicz 2009 ) .    figure  [ fig3 ] shows the evolution of the semi  major axes of the planets and of the period ratios for 3 planets with minimum masses initially located at 0.2 , 0.34 and 0.6  au , respectively .",

    "this is at least 3 orders or magnitude smaller than the values supposed to apply in earth  like planets , but this value was chosen to give evolutionary timescales that could be reasonably handled numerically ( i.e. runs that could be done within weeks on a single processor ) .",
    "tests carried out below with more realistic values of @xmath27 indicate that the evolution during the disc migration phase is not affected by this specification .",
    "furthermore , when the planets are inside the cavity , the scaling given by equation  ( [ hscal ] ) holds , implying that increasing @xmath27 corresponds to scaling to a longer evolutionary timescale . with @xmath116 ,",
    "the eccentricity damping timescale given by equation  ( [ teccs ] ) is @xmath118  years for a 1  m@xmath54 planet at 0.05  au , inducing a timescale on which the semi ",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the evolution of the semi  major axes , the eccentricities , the period ratios and the resonant angles @xmath120 and @xmath121 . as pointed out above , the laplace resonance for which all four resonant angles librate is established while the planets migrate in the disc , after about @xmath122  years .",
    "the resonant angles @xmath123 and @xmath77 stay close to zero . then , while some of the planets are still in the disc , a weak instability appears for a finite period of time ( after about @xmath111   years ) and the resonance is weakened with the angles driven to large amplitude libration with an occasional circulation .",
    "but the instability eventually dies out and the resonance is recovered before the planets decouple from the disc . note",
    "that this instability is not always seen in the runs we have performed .",
    "as indicated above it seems to be associated with an approach to a transition to a resonance of higher degree .",
    "this is indicated by the fact that when the migration rate was speeded up by a factor of @xmath124 the outer pair of planets underwent a transition to a @xmath125 resonance while the inner pair maintained a @xmath126 commensurability at the point at which the semi - major axes had attained the same configuration .    during the migration phase ,",
    "the eccentricities are pumped up to several hundredths . because of the low value of @xmath27 , tidal interaction with the star begins to affect the evolution of the system slightly before the outermost planet penetrates inside the cavity .",
    "once the outermost planet reaches the disc inner edge , the disc is removed altogether from the calculation , so that if the planet is pushed out again it will not interact with the disc .",
    "this procedure is introduced to take into account the disappearance of the disc on a timescale of a few million years . in this particular run",
    ", the outermost planet enters the cavity after @xmath127  years . at that point , changes in semi  major axes are due only to tidal interaction with the star .",
    "as the eccentricities of the two inner planets are damped from a few @xmath64 to @xmath64 , their semi  major axes decrease by about 1  percent ( see plot b of fig .  [ fig3 ] ) in such a way that their period ratio increases by somewhat more than a percent , going from 2 to 2.037 ( see plot d of fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "in the meantime , the eccentricity of the outermost planet is hardly affected , as it was already very small ( a few @xmath128 ) when the planet entered the cavity . because of the conservation of the total angular momentum though , its semi  major axis increases by about 1  percent , which results in the period ratio of the outer pair of planets increasing by a few percent , from 2 to 2.077 .",
    "therefore , strict commensurability is lost .",
    "however , we note that the resonant angles still librate , so that the laplace resonance is not disrupted .",
    "the fact that the deviation of the outer period ratio from  2 is twice the deviation of the inner period ratio from  2 is a consequence of the laplace relation ( equation  [ [ lapr ] ] of appendix a ) and this feature is preserved in the subsequent evolution of this and similar cases .",
    "as we shall see , these deviations increase approximately @xmath6 , as predicted from equation  ( [ hscal ] ) .",
    "as noted above , the laplace relation is not satisfied in hd  40307 . as we shall see below ,",
    "it is possible to obtain the correct relationship between the period ratios provided the laplace resonance is disrupted such that only @xmath129 and @xmath78 librate and contribute to the secular evolution ( see also section [ initecc ] ) .    in order to investigate the dependence on the specification of the circularization rates induced by the disc",

    "we here consider examples for which :    @xmath130    and : @xmath131    results for cases both with the minimum masses for hd 40307 and twice the mimimum masses are plotted in figure [ figjpmig ] . during the disc induced migration ,",
    "a three planet resonance is formed in both cases .",
    "as expected , the evolution for the higher mass case is twice as fast but otherwise similar .",
    "the resonance shows only small signs of instability while the planets migrate inwards .",
    "this is probably helped by the fact that the migration rate is here constant rather than increasing inwards as in the previous simulation .",
    "as the migration continues , the resonant angles @xmath132 ( @xmath133 ) all enter libration , but after the planets enter the cavity there is an adjustment so that only @xmath123 and @xmath77 librate .",

    "in this paper , we have shown that the planets around the star hd  40307 could be undergoing a resonant interaction , despite departure of the period ratios from very precise commensurability .",
    "this is indicated by the fact that three of the four resonant angles librate or are associated with long term changes to the orbital elements .",
    "note that such a resonant state can occur without exact commensurability only because the eccentricities are very small , which can be brought about as a result of tidal circularization from a state with initially higher eccentricities ( see section [ initecc ] ) .",
    "when this occurs in a system that starts from a near 2:1 commensurability , the difference of the period ratios from two then increases @xmath178    we propose that the planets in this system were in a strict laplace resonance while they migrated through the disc , with all 4 resonant angles librating .",
    "exact commensurability was then departed from as indicated above as a result of the tidal interaction with the star , which preserved libration of at least some of the resonant angles , after the planets entered the disc inner cavity . because of the laplace relation , the period ratios evolve in such a way that the ratio for the inner pair of planets is smaller than that of the outer pair of planets .",
    "the opposite is observed in hd  40307 .    to get the appropriate form for the period ratios , some disruption of the resonance set up in the cavity needs to take place ( this is in contrast to claims by zhou 2009 ) .",
    "a close encounter for instance might be a possible cause .",
    "an impulsive interaction would be sudden enough that the resonance would not respond adiabatically . if the velocity of the innermost planet is reduced by a factor 0.996 for instance , deviation of the inner period ratio from two",
    "gets twice as large as the corresponding deviation for the outer period ratio , while 3 of the 4 resonant angles still librate , similar to the situation in hd  40307 , within the lifetime of the system",
    ".    however , we found that we could get a period ratio of 2.23 for the inner pair only if the masses are significantly larger than the minimum masses and tidal dissipation is possibly unrealistically effective . from the results obtained in section [ sec : simulations ] ,",
    "when the laplace resonance is disrupted at an early stage , we estimate that the deviation of the inner period ratio from two is approximately given as a function of time by @xmath179 where @xmath180 @xmath181 and @xmath182 ( @xmath183 and @xmath184 are assumed fixed for the purposes of this discussion ) .",
    "accordingly , to attain @xmath185 we would require masses exceeding the minimum estimate by about a factor of two for @xmath186    if the laplace resonance is preserved , from the results obtained in section [ sec : simulations ] , we may also estimate that the deviation of the outer period ratio from two is approximately given as a function of time by @xmath187 .",
    "thus it may be possible to get a period ratio of 2.13 for the outer pair of planets with near to minimum masses in a reasonable time if @xmath188 for all the planets , but then the inner period ratio would be only @xmath189 it would thus seem likely that additional stronger dynamical interactions are required to bring the system to its final state .    for example we found that if the outer planet was given an eccentricity @xmath190 shortly after decoupling from the disc , period ratios similar to those observed in hd  40307 could be produced on a time scale of a few  @xmath191 ( see sections [ initecc ] and [ sec : simulations ] ) . then , the work presented in this paper indicates that tidal circularization would continue through resonant interaction with the period ratios separating after these interactions are over .",
    "note that a similar type of scenario may apply to the system of planets around gj  581 , which is currently closer to exact commensurablilty than hd  40307 .",
    "indeed , different mean motion resonances can be established while the planets migrate within the disc , depending on the initial relative location of the planets and on the migration timescale . however , as it appears that this system may have been in higher order resonances than hd  40307 , it is possible that these would have been broken completely as a result of circularization .",

    "if it were the case , extrapolating back in time the tidal evolution of the eccentricities from current values ( estimated from direct simulations of the observed system ) , the system would have been unstable .",
    "the work in this paper does not support such a conclusion .",
    "we note that barnes et al .",
    "( 2009 ) neglected the dynamical interactions between the planets , which clearly will have played a role if the current eccentricities are small because resonant interactions coupled with tidal effects have been associated with long term changes to the orbital elements .",
    "the results reported in this paper indicate that resonances in multiple low mass  planet systems may play more of a role than currently claimed in the literature .",
    "significant departure from exact mean motion resonance does not necessarily preclude a resonant state when , for example , tidal effects are important causing eccentricities to be small , as libration of some of the resonant angles in that case may still exist , and be associated with long term evolution of the orbital elements .",
    "although the confirmation of resonance effects is problematic for small eccentricities , we expect that further detections and analysis of systems similar to hd  40307 will test the relevance of the scenarios explored in this paper .    finally , we comment that , because of the rapid increase of the effectiveness of tidal interactions with decreasing orbital period , the dynamical interactions discussed here would be of much greater importance for systems in which the period of the innermost planet is significantly shorter than in the hd  40307 system .",
    "for example , we note that the planet corot7  b , which has a projected mass of 11.12  m@xmath2 , has a period of only 0.85 day ( lger et al .",
    "if this short period orbit is a result of migration , it is likely this planet was pushed inwards by a companion which would have been on a commensurable orbit ( terquem & papaloizou 2007 ) .",
    "we note in support of this idea that pre - main sequence stars typically have rotation periods of several days ( bouvier et al .",
    "1993 ) , which would imply that the disc inner cavity should extend well beyond the orbit of corot7  b if that were magnetically maintained . in that case",

    "in this appendix we develop a semi  analytic model that shows how a two or three planet system undergoes radial spreading as a result of evolution driven by tidal circularization .",

    "subsequently , we add the effects of tides .      we adopt jacobi coordinates ( sinclair  1975 , papaloizou & szuszkiewicz  2005 ) for which the radius vector of planet @xmath192 @xmath193 is measured relative to the centre of mass of the system comprised of @xmath194 and all other planets interior to @xmath192 for @xmath195 with @xmath196 here and @xmath197 corresponding to the innermost planet .",

    "the time averages of these quantities as well as @xmath238 and @xmath239 @xmath240 are assumed to vary on the tidal time scale or longer . when these are non zero , long term changes to the orbital elements @xmath24 and @xmath36 may occur through planet - planet interactions even without tides . as illustrated in figures [ figjp2 ] and [ figjp2a ] , six of these quantities are found to exhibit steady long term time averages of the required type that are quickly established for a model of hd  40307 with assumed @xmath241    as this averaging procedure results in equations of essentially the same form as the case where the participating resonant angles ( defined to be those that are associated with non zero time averages ) are assumed to have averages close to but not equal to zero or @xmath242 while undergoing small amplitude librations , leading to the same scaling with physical parameters , but with an adjustment of numerical coefficients . for simplicity we restrict consideration to that case . assuming small amplitude librations of all four angles , equations  ( [ eqntid2])([eqntid5 ] ) give relations of the form : @xmath243 where : @xmath244 and the @xmath132 in the above can be set to either zero or @xmath69    we note that , when all four angles participate , equations  ( [ lap2 ] ) and  ( [ lap3 ] ) imply the strict laplace resonance relation @xmath245 however , simulations of hd  40307 indicate that only @xmath246 and @xmath78 participate .",

    "we note that a similar discussion applies when only @xmath251 and @xmath77 participate that leads to the same conclusions ( @xmath252 decays independently due to tides in that case and may be taken to be zero ) . in all cases",
    ", one can readily verify that the above system provides a complete set of equations for the time averages of the resonant angles and the orbital elements when the form of the tidal forces is specified .",
    "however , we note that we can obtain the characteristic form and time scale of the evolution by considering the conservation energy given by ( [ econ ] ) together with the constancy of the total angular momentum .",
    "to do this we begin , by noting that equations ( [ lap1 ] ) and ( [ lap4 ] ) provide equations for the mean motion ratios of the form : @xmath253 and : @xmath254 and @xmath255 and @xmath256 are defined implicitly through equations  ( [ lap1 ] ) and ( [ lap4 ] ) . in addition , equation  ( [ lap3 ] ) gives @xmath257 in terms of @xmath252 , @xmath258 and @xmath259 in the form : @xmath260 when @xmath261 has zero time average and so is replaced by zero , equation  ( [ lap2 ] ) does not hold and accordingly the laplace relation also does not hold .",
    "we comment that @xmath258 and @xmath259 measure the deviation from strict commensurability of the corresponding mean motions and _ do not have to be small .",
    "_ for a system such as hd  40307 these are large , particularly in comparison comparison to the characteristic size of the eccentricities .",
    "we remark that according to equations ( [ lap1 ] ) - ( [ lap4 ] ) , other things remaining fixed , the eccentricities are proportional to the planet mass scale and , inversely proportional to the deviation from commensurability .",
    "the results presented in section [ initecc ] confirm these trends but with some deviation that is to be expected because all the relevant resonant angles , although contributing to the evolution , are not in a state of small amplitude libration in those simulations .",
    "replacing @xmath262 ( @xmath263 ) by @xmath194 to simplify expressions without loss of content ( as @xmath264 ) , the total energy and angular momentum may be written , respectively , as : @xmath265,\\ ] ] and : @xmath266.\\ ] ] here , we have neglected in @xmath267 terms proportional to the squares of the eccentricities as these can be shown to lead to small effects compared to those arising from the eccentricity dependence of @xmath255 and @xmath268 we now use the above together with equation  ( [ econ ] ) to form the quantity @xmath269 and find that this is given by :      we may write equation  ( [ elcon ] ) in terms of the deviations from commensurabiity : @xmath271 and @xmath272 , obtaining : @xmath273 in addition , the right hand side can be expressed in terms of @xmath274 and @xmath275 using equations  ( [ lap1])([lap4 ] ) which give : @xmath276 \\frac{gm_3m_2 ^ 2n_3 ^ 2c_{2,3}^2\\cos^2\\phi_4 } { w_{2,3}^2ma_3n_3 ^ 2 t_{e,3}^s}.   \\label{elwcon}\\ ] ] we may now obtain characteristic form of the time evolution of the departure from strict commensurability . to do this",
