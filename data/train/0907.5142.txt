    "the torque on the black hole is always towards alignment of the black hole with the outer parts of the disc because the angular momentum of the disc is effectively very large compared to that of the hole @xcite .",
    "this is because the angular momentum of the binary orbit is transferred to the outer parts of the disc when the tidal torque acts @xcite .    by comparing the sizes of various terms in the governing equation  ( [ maineq ] )",

    "the precise form of @xmath65 will become clearer in section  [ 62 ] when we use it to simplify equation  ( [ eq ] ) .",
    "the overall warping of the disc is caused by the misalignment between the lense - thirring precession which dominates at small radii and the tidal precession which dominates at large radii .",
