    "x - ray absorption by partially ionized , optically thin material , along the line of sight of the central engine , the so called _ warm absorber _ , is one of the prominent features in the x - ray spectrum of many agn @xcite .",
    "the presence of such gas was first postulated in order to explain the unusual form of the x - ray spectrum of qso mr 2251 - 178 @xcite . a direct confirmation of the existence of circumnuclear ionized matter came from _ asca _ , which for the first time was able to resolve the ovii and oviii absorption edges ( at rest energies of 0.74 and 0.87 , respectively ) in the x - ray spectra of the seyfert 1 galaxy mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 @xcite .",
    "systematic studies of warm absorbers in seyfert 1 galaxies with _ asca _ have shown their ubiquity , being detected in half of the sources @xcite .",
    "warm absorbers were usually described by single zone , photoionization equilibrium models . under this assumption ,",
    "simple variability patterns were expected : increasing ionization of the matter when the source brightens .",
    "this was not found by otani et al . during their long - look _ asca _ observation of the nearby ( z=0.008 ) seyfert 1 galaxy mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 .",
    "the source varied with large amplitude on short time scales ( @xmath1 s or so ) .",
    "the depth of the ovii edge , on the contrary , stayed almost constant , while that of the oviii edge was anticorrelated with the flux .",
    "to explain the behaviour of the ovii and oviii edges , the authors adopted a multizone model in which the ovii and oviii edges originate from spatially distinct regions .",
    "ovii ions in the region responsible for the ovii edge , the outer absorber , have a long recombination timescale ( i.e. weeks or more ) , whereas the oviii edge arises from more highly ionized material , the inner absorber , in which most oxygen is fully stripped .",
    "the recombination timescale for the oix ions in the inner absorber is of the order of @xmath2 or less .",
    "a decrease in the primary ionizing flux is then accompanied by the recombination of oix to oviii , giving the observed variation in the oviii edge depth .",
    "orr et al . raised the possibility of a more complex warm absorber . during their mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 _ bepposax _ observation",
    "the depth of the ovii edge was marginally consistent with being constant , whereas the optical depth for oviii , @xmath3 , exhibited significant variability .",
    "the authors claimed that its large value during epoch 1 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 uncertainty ) was inconsistent with the values at all other epochs .",
    "they also pointed out that the value of @xmath3 during epoch 5 ( a low luminosity state ) did not show the expected anticorrelaction with the ionizing flux .",
    "in both otani et al . and orr et al . , @xmath3 was plotted versus count rate . in order to compare _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ observations , these two observational results for @xmath3 have been plotted versus luminosity , @xmath6 and pimms ( http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/tools/w3pimms.html ) . ] in 0.1 - 10 in figure 1 ( instead of versus count rate ) .",
    "the conversion from count rate to luminosity is different for each apparatus and therefore , the comparison can not be made using count rate , but luminosity .",
    "the only discrepancy between both sets of data is the result for epoch 1 ( labelled 1 in figure 1 ) .",
    "note also that there is no disagreement at all with any other point ( orr et al . mentioned epoch 5 as problematic , but in this plot it appears consistent with the rest of the otani et al .",
    "data ) .    in this paper we present a simple photoionization model that accounts for the experimental results of both _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ observations .",
    "section 2 describes the code used to model the inner warm absorber .",
    "the application to the mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 warm absorber is presented in section 3 .",
    "the extension of the multi - zone model for the warm absorber ( i. e. the third component ) is addressed in section 4 .",
    "finally our conclusions are discussed in section 5 .",
    "in order to reproduce both _ asca _ and _ bepposax _ observations , the state of the inner absorber has been modelled using a time dependent photoionization code for oxygen @xcite .",
    "this code treats the material in the inner absorber as containing only ions of oxygen in an otherwise completely ionized hydrogen plasma .",
    "a given oxygen ion is assumed to be in one of the 9 states corresponding to its ionization level .",
    "different excitation levels of a given ionization state are not treated .",
    "the total abundance of oxygen is fixed at @xmath7@xcite relative to hydrogen . both ions and electrons",
    "are assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium ( lte ) with a common temperature t and the plasma is assumed to be strictly optically - thin at all frequencies ( i.e. radiative transfer processes are not considered ) .",
    "a point source of ionizing radiation is placed at a distance @xmath8 from this material with a frequency dependent luminosity @xmath9 ( total luminosity @xmath10 ) . in the calculations presented here ,",
    "the ionizing continuum is taken to be a power - law with a photon index @xmath11 extending from @xmath12 to @xmath13 : i.e. we take    @xmath14    where @xmath15 .",
    "the upper and lower cutoff frequencies are chosen such that @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , corresponding to @xmath18 .",
    "the physical processes included in the code are : photoionization , auger ionization , collisional ionization , radiative recombination , dielectronic recombination , bremsstrahlung , compton scattering and collisionally - excited o@xmath191035 resonance line cooling . given these processes , the ionization and thermal structure of the plasma",
    "is evolved from an initial state assumed to have a temperature of @xmath20 , and equal ionization fractions in each state .",
    "the ionization structure of the oxygen is governed by 9 equations of the form : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number density of state - i , @xmath23 stands for the ionization / recombination rate per unit volume , the first summation on the right hand side ( rhs ) is over all ionization and recombination mechanisms that produce",
    "state - i and the second summation is over all such mechanisms that destroy state - i .",
    "the thermal evolution of the plasma is determined by the local heating / cooling rate and the macroscopic constraint .",
    "the net heating rate per unit volume is given by : @xmath24 where @xmath25 stands for the heating / cooling rate per unit volume , the first summation on the rhs is over all heating processes and the second term is over all cooling processes .",
    "for a _ constant density _ plasma , we have @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the internal energy per unit volume and is given by : @xmath28 thus , the rate of change of temperature is related to the heating / cooling rate via : @xmath29    the state of the plasma is evolved using the ionization equations represented by ( 2 ) and the energy equation ( 3 ) .",
    "a simple step - by - step integration of these differential equation is performed .",
    "the time step for the integration process is allowed to dynamically change and is set to be @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the shortest relevant timescale . ] . in the case of a constant ionizing luminosity",
    ", it is found that the system always evolves to an equilibrium state , as expected .",
    "the model has been compared against the photoionization code cloudy@xcite ( version 9004 , @xcite ) in the case of a plasma in photoionization equilibrium . figures 2 and 3 report this comparison.there is a qualitative agreement between the model ( solid line ) and cloudy ( dashed line ) in figure 2 for the case of a pure hydrogen / oxygen plasma .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to reproduce the time variability of the oxygen edges , and , this figure shows how our model mirrors quite well the behavior of this element .",
    "cloudy includes many more physical processes and realistic elemental abundances and , as seen in figure 3 , the agreement is not so good when more elements are considered .",
    "we have also investigated the reaction of a constant density plasma to an inverted top hat function for the light - curve ( i.e. initially @xmath20 , equal ionization fractions in each state , the luminosity is @xmath32 and held constant .",
    "the system is allowed to achieve an equilibrium at an ionization parameter @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the density of the warm plasma and @xmath8 is the distance of the slab of the plasma from the ionizing source of radiation with isotropic ionizing luminosity @xmath10 .",
    "the luminosity is then halved for a short period , @xmath35 , and then back to its initial value ) . during these changes ,",
    "the state of the plasma is recorded as a function of time .",
    "this choice of @xmath36 places the inner warm absorber a region where @xmath37 ( i.e. in this regime @xmath38 is expected to be inversely proportional to @xmath36 or equivalently to @xmath10 ) .",
    "the investigation has been carried out for different values of @xmath34 and @xmath8 keeping @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( i.e. the constraints given by otani et al .",
    "for the inner warm absorber ) .",
    "4 shows an example of the results obtained .",
    "as expected , @xmath38 increases when @xmath10 is halved , showing a more noticeable increment when @xmath10 is halved over a longer period .",
    "to reproduce the observational data using our model , it is required to obtain the value of the optical depth for oviii once the ionization fraction @xmath38 has been calculated by the code . considering the cross section for oviii , @xmath41 , as constant along the",
    "line - of - sight and using the fact that the material contains only ions of oxygen in an otherwise completely ionized plasma , the optical depth for oviii , @xmath3 , can be written as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 @xcite , @xmath44 is the line - of - sight distance through the ionized plasma , @xmath45 is the electron density , @xmath46 is the oxygen abundance relative to hydrogen@xcite and @xmath47 is the ionization fraction for i ionization species for oxygen .",
    "the light - curve used to reproduced the _ asca _ observation is given by otani et al . .",
    "for the _ bepposax _ observation , the light - curve has been defined as a step function with a constant value for the luminosity @xmath10 over the different time periods given by orr et al . . the constant value for @xmath10 over each period is chosen to be that given in orr et al .",
    "( 1997 , fig .",
    "3 ) plus a period of @xmath48 previous to epoch 1 with @xmath49 ( a standard value for the luminosity during the observation ) .",
    "different parameters for the warm absorber have been investigated using the constraints given by otani et al . .",
    "with the only exception of point 1 ( see figure 1 ) , a general good agreement for all other experimental points is found .    following a suggestion by orr et al . , we have modified the light - curve for the _ bepposax _ observation including a previous epoch to it for which the luminosity is much lower ( the range of values used is @xmath50 ) .",
    "the reason for using this very low value for the luminosity is that in a regime for which @xmath37 , the highest values @xmath38 are expected for low values of @xmath10 .",
    "however , the suggested explanation does not reproduce the high value of @xmath51 for epoch 1 in the _ bepposax _ observation .",
    "even for those values of @xmath36 that give a maximum for @xmath38 ( i.e. @xmath52 ) , the ionization fraction for o(viii ) is still too low to account for the high @xmath53 value at epoch 1 .",
    "the model we propose to explain both _",
    "asca _ and _ bepposax _ observations incorporates a new zone for the warm absorber .",
    "let warm absorber 1 @xmath54 wa1 be the inner warm absorber which parameters are : @xmath40 , @xmath39 and @xmath55 .",
    "the outer warm absorber will be warm absorber 2 @xmath54 wa2 with parameters @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in our model a warm absorber 3 @xmath54 wa3 is situated between wa1 and wa2 .",
    "the wa3 radius and density will have values between those of wa1 and wa2 .",
    "therefore , while wa1 and wa2 respond on timescales of hours and weeks respectively , wa3 is expected to respond to variations in the ionizing flux on timescales of days .",
    "wa3 would have an ionization parameter @xmath36 of the order of 500 for @xmath32 .",
    "hence the ionization fraction for this value of @xmath10 is too low to be detected .",
    "only when the luminosity of the source is sufficiently low ( i.e. @xmath52 ) , wa3 reveals its presence by contributing to the total optical depth for oviii .",
    "the medium between wa1 and wa2 would be constituted by a continuum of warm absorbers : clouds with different densities situated at different radii .",
    "only some of them happen to be at the radius and have densities that efficiently absorbs the oviii edge energy ( i.e. most of them are undetectable ) . in baldwin et al . a model for the blr",
    "is presented , in which individual blr clouds can be thought of as machines for reprocessing radiation .",
    "as long as there are enough clouds at the correct radius and with the correct gas density to efficiently form a given line , the line will be formed with a relative strength which turns out to be very similar to the one observed .",
    "similarly in our model , only wa1 and wa2 are detectable for the ordinary values of the ionizing flux . only for the case of a state of low luminosity , wa3 will be unmasked .",
    "other zones , as yet unseen , may be present .    assuming then the presence of wa3 and also an epoch of low luminosity previous to the _ bepposax _ observation , the expected wa3 behaviour would be :    \\i ) when @xmath59 ( previous to epoch 1 ) , the ionization parameter @xmath52 , giving a high value for @xmath38 .",
    "this period lasts for approximately @xmath60 , so the plasma has time to recombine .",
    "\\ii ) when @xmath61 ( i.e. during the observation ) , then @xmath62 .",
    "for these high values of @xmath36 , oxygen is practically fully stripped and therefore there is a very small contribution to the optical depth for oviii .",
    "the range of parameters investigated for wa3 is @xmath63 cm , @xmath64 and @xmath44 in the interval that gives a column density for wa3 approximately equal to @xmath65 . after taking into account the soft x - ray absorption due to wa1 ,",
    "the response of wa3 has been calculated and an example of the results obtained is presented in figures 5 and 6 , where the general good agreement is also extended to point 1 .",
    "wa3 has also been modelled using cloudy and we found a drop in the transmitted portion of the incident continuum at @xmath66 , of approximately @xmath67 ( i.e. undetectable for current instruments ) .",
    "the coronal lines strength has also been checked using cloudy .",
    "the ratio of the modelled to observed fluxes for wa3 are all below @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the covering fraction , wa2 does , unless a low value of @xmath69 is considered . this possibility is currently being investigated . ] .",
    "finally , the contribution to @xmath70(ovii ) from each component for our model has been calculated and , as expected , we found that wa2 is the main responsible for the ovii edge ( its contribution makes 96% of the total value of @xmath70(ovii ) ) .",
    "warm absorbers have been the subject of extensive studies during the last decade .",
    "such regions are not spatially resolved , and all the available information about their geometry is obtained from analysis of the variability of the oxygen edges .",
    "the explanation we offer for the time variability of the mcg@xmath06 - 30 - 15 warm absorber during both _",
    "asca _ and _ bepposax _ observations does not invoke complex processes , but a very simple photoionization model together with the presence of a multi - zone warm absorber .",
    "this would be constituted by a continuum of clouds at different radii and different densities , such that only some of them contribute to the total optical depth for oviii depending on the value of the luminosity .    as a final remark note how in our model wa3 is much more volume filling than wa1 ( @xmath71 for wa3 while @xmath72 for wa1 ) .",
    "this suggests that wa3 could be part of the inter - cloud medium of wa1 .",
