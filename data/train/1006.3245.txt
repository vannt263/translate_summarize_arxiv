    "while the experimental identification of inverse cascades would be crucial for understanding the real growth rate of excited kinetic instability modes , the detection based on wavelet analysis has to be interpreted rather carefully .",
    "the main reason is that the widely used basic wavelet analysis is non - adaptive @xcite .",
    "once the basic wavelet is chosen it is used for the whole data set .",
    "this is not a problem when observations with gradual frequency changes , chirp signals , or wave trains are analyzed .",
    "actually , the harmonic signals used to test the wavelet identification of inverse cascade features by @xcite belong to this category of well treatable signals",
    ". however , sudden jumps ( non - stationarity ) or nonlinearity can generate spurious time - frequency - energy distributions in a wavelet representation .",
    "the basic wavelet transform is also linear @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , wavelets can be used successfully for the multi - scale analysis of nonlinear systems @xcite .",
    "the results of wavelet analysis , however , heavily depend on the mother wavelet , proper resolution , scale discretization @xcite , resulting in non - adaptiveness for multi - component non - stationary data .",
    "the effect of non - stationarity is demonstrated in figure 1a , b. the test data consisting of a single sine wave with period 1 s and a sudden jump ( figure 1a ) is analyzed using the morlet wavelet .",
    "the time - wavelet period - energy distribution ( wavelet scalogram ) in figure 1b is showing that the time localization of the sine wave ( between 4 and 5s ) is good only at wavelet periods near @xmath3 0.125 s. the time localization is rather poor at the wavelet period of 1s , which is the actual sine wave period . using a different",
    ", optimized wavelet might lead to a slightly better localization of the sine wave .",
    "certainly , a mother wavelet can not be equally good for an unknown combination of periodic or stochastic components in a time series .",
    "component ; bottom subplots : empirical modes ; @xmath4s , for @xmath5.,width=313 ]    sudden jumps lead to broad - band energy distributions ( figure 1b ) . since for higher frequencies the basic wavelet is more localized , the sudden jump at time=9s is well localized in time over small wavelet period ranges .",
    "the time localization worsens towards longer periods where the basic wavelet is more stretched .",
    "the non - stationarity also induces spurious periodicities in the time - period plane , in our case between time=7 - 8 s , where the test signal contains no fluctuations at all .",
    "actually , it can be even worse than that .",
    "the wavelet identification of scales ( periods ) can be entirely misleading . for example",
    ", @xcite argue that a change occurring over large scales locally in time will appear in the corresponding time - period distribution over small scales , due to the basic wavelet resolution .",
    "that is , a localized large - scale change ( non - stationarity ) manifests itself over small scales in the wavelet spectrum .",
    "to be able to identify inverse cascade features we need a method which is adaptive and suitable for non - stationary and nonlinear analysis of multi - scale data .",
    "the hilbert transform ( ht ) represents a convolution of time series @xmath6 with time @xmath7 , therefore accentuates the local properties of @xmath6 .",
    "ht is defined as @xcite    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the cauchy principal value of the integral . @xmath6 and @xmath10 are orthogonal and form a complex conjugate pair    @xmath11    @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the instantenous amplitude and phase , respectively . the instantenous angular frequency @xmath14 is the time derivative of @xmath13 .",
    "ht is known for a long time , but the practical value of instantenous frequency @xmath14 was questioned , because of non - unique local values .",
    "local uniqueness can be achieved by putting some constraints on the data ( cohen , 1995 ) .",
    "@xcite proposed a practical decomposition algorithm , called empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) , which removes the ambiguity in determination of @xmath15 .",
    "the extracted empirical modes ( @xmath16s ) fulfill certain conditions without any loss of essential nonlinear features of the original data and also ensure adaptiveness to local signal characteristics @xcite .",
    "the emd procedure fits splines to local maxima and minima of @xmath6 , finds the mean @xmath17 from the two spline functions and computes the residuals @xmath18 .",
    "these steps are iterated until a threshold is reached .",
    "the first mode is given by @xmath19 .",
    "the next mode is found in the same way as @xmath20 , but replacing the original data @xmath6 with @xmath21 .",
    "successive @xmath4 modes are found by repeating the whole process , until the last residue contains only a simple trend .",
    "even complex signals can be decomposed to a finite number of @xmath4s .",
    "for example , ht based on the emd was successfully applied to intermittent turbulence @xcite just recently . the extracted @xmath16 modes represents narrow band stationary gaussian processes",
    ". moreover , the modes are locally symmetric relative to the envelopes defined by the local maxima and minima .",
    "this means that the local means are not computed over a time window or a local time scale , but are obtained directly from the local values of the envelopes .",
    "the instantenous frequency is determined by taking ht of each @xmath22 .",
    "the time and frequency localization is demonstrated for the test signal in figure 1c .",
    "the test signal was decomposed into three @xmath4s ( not shown ) .",
    "contrary to wavelet results ( figure 1b ) the localization is rather good , without spurious energy distributions in the time - frequency distribution .",
    "now , we are going to apply the hilbert - huang method to the event studied by @xcite , proclaimed to be an example of inverse cascade observed by the wavelet method .",
    "cd and the associated dipolarization was observed by the themis a spacecraft at @xmath23 , between 07:45 and 07:50 ut on 29 january 2008 .",
    "( in what follows , we will use decimal hours ) .",
    "since the event occurred near a substorm expansion onset , cd is considered to be a substorm triggering agent .",
    "the inverse cascade was found to be most remarkable in the magnetic component @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "the top panel in figure 2 shows the @xmath24 component of the magnetic field . using the hilbert - huang method described above six @xmath4s",
    "were found which represent the decomposition of @xmath24 into monocomponent modes .",
    "the modes are shown in the subsequent subplots in figure 2 . in figure 3",
    "the power spectral density ( psd ) is depicted , computed for @xmath24 ( thick red line , for a better visibility shifted ) and @xmath25 .",
    "the monocomponent modes are narrow - band fluctuations , having finite bandwidth in psd . for example",
    ", @xmath26 exhibits the maximum power around the frequency @xmath27 hz .",
    "nevertheless , figure 3 represents only a rough demonstration of monocomponent modes .",
    "the modes in psd correspond to a global description based on the fourier transform .",
    "the monocomponent modes identified through the hilbert - huang method differ due to the localized constraints introduced in their determination explained above in section 3 . in spite of the finite bandwith the hilbert - huang modes can exhibit non - stationarity through frequency and amplitude modulation @xcite .    following the @xcite findings the inverse cascade should operate roughly over the frequency range from @xmath28 to @xmath29 hz .",
    "the magnetic field psd shows scaling ( thick red dashed line ) over a narrower range from @xmath30 to @xmath29 hz .",
    "though we do not intend to identify the inverse cascade on the basis of psd , this scaling region could be associated with the developing nonlinear interactions .",
    "the power of @xmath31 modes over the scaling region is by 2 - 4 orders of magnitude smaller than the power of @xmath32 modes .",
    "moreover , the @xmath33 mode contains only a smooth trend , therefore , we will investigate @xmath34 further .",
    "figure 4 compares the wavelet time - period - energy spectrum ( middle subplot ) and the hilbert - huang time - frequency spectrum ( bottom subplot ) .",
    "@xmath24 is in the top subplot .",
    "there are three vertical and inclined dashed lines in the wavelet plot .",
    "the lines are guides for eyes to see the frequency trend of activity in time .",
    "at least in three cases , there is an increased wavelet power which appears first at shorter time scales near the ion gyroperiod ( @xmath3 10 s ) .",
    "power over longer time scales appears later .",
    "our wavelet representation of @xmath24 is slightly different than the one published by @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the wavelet representation shows the same qualitative features as the wavelet analysis in @xcite paper : increasing wavelet power bridging gradually the scales between the ion gyroperiod ( @xmath3 10s ) and typical dipolarization time ( @xmath35 100 s ) .",
    "it is easy to notice that the enhanced small - scale wavelet power ( indicated by dashed vertical lines in figure 4 ) and the largest amplitude jumps in @xmath24 occur simultaneously ( vertical arrow lines ) .",
    "the dubious small - scale activity can occur due to a local sharp change ( like in figure 1 ) , which might have nothing to do with the inverse cascade . having in mind the limitations of the wavelet method , the uncertainty connected with sharp jumps in the data can not be removed .",
    "therefore , a wavelet independent test is needed . the bottom subplot in figure 4 ,",
    "corresponding to the hilbert - huang time - frequency spectrum of @xmath36 and @xmath37 empirical modes ( these are within the psd scaling region , see figure 3 ) , seems to substantiate the idea of multi - scale physics .",
    "we note , the @xmath4 spectra can not be interpreted roughly before 07.74 and after 07.84 ut because of interval finite - size effects .",
    "the first high - frequency activation ( at @xmath38 hz after 07.75 ut ) in @xmath36 occurs simultaneously with the beginning of small amplitude fluctuations in @xmath24 .",
    "there is no increased power visible in the wavelet spectrum at around 07.75 ut in figure 4 , neither in the wavelet spectrum of @xcite , which could be associated with those @xmath24 fluctuations . in @xmath36",
    "the frequency decreases to @xmath29 hz at 07.78 ut then , after a short return to @xmath39 hz , it falls down to @xmath40 hz at 07.81 ut .",
    "overall , the instantenous @xmath36 time scales change from 30 to 330 s as time proceeds . during the interval of interest",
    ", @xmath37 varies between @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( 10 - 100 s ) .",
    "there are a few correlations between the wavelet and hilbert - huang spectra in figure 4 .",
    "for example , the enhanced small - scale activity in wavelet spectra is associated with high - frequency fluctuations in @xmath37 between 07.76 and 07.8 ut .",
    "the first two local peaks in @xmath37 seem to correlate with the first two small - scale activations in the wavelet spectra between 07.76 and 07.77 ut . on the other hand , the local peak in @xmath37",
    "between 07.78 and 07.79 ut has no counterpart in the wavelet spectra .",
    "moreover , there are low - frequency valleys in between high - frequency local peaks , which are related to the occurrence of multi - scale interactions more complicated than a simple inverse cascade . in contrary to the wavelet method the hilbert - huang results indicate that the inverse cascade picture can not fully explain the observed multi - scale fluctuations .",
    "this does not necessarily mean that the linkage between local kinetic instabilities and large - scale processes is negligible .",
    "in this paper we have shown that the typical limitations of wavelet methodology make the identification of cd associated inverse cascades doubtful and misleading .",
    "the observations of cd associated fluctuations are short in time , the magnetic field changes are highly dynamic .",
    "as it was outlined in the paper , the hilbert - huang method is more suitable for nonstationary and nonlinear processes .",
    "its adaptiveness allows to compute straightforwardly the instantenous frequency and reproduce the time - frequency representation of the time series based on decomposed empirical modes . in qualitative agreement with the wavelet results ,",
    "the time evolution of instantenous frequency shows a general trend of raising magnetic fluctuations from high - frequencies to low - frequencies .",
    "however , the details of multi - scale fluctuations and the time locations of high - frequency activations are rather different in the wavelet and the hilbert - huang spectra . in the latter , there are also intervals where the frequency locally increases with time . in this paper",
    "we put a particular emphasis on the differences between the wavelet and hilbert - huang representations , demonstrating that for the cd associated non - stationary magnetic fluctuations the wavelet approach can lead to misleading conclusions .",
    "we believe the more adaptive hilbert - huang approach can reconstruct the time evolution of instantenous frequency better , therefore , the identification of turbulent cascades occurring over the appropriate frequency ranges could be more straightforward .",
    "since we were not able to identify a simple inverse cascade from the data , the contribution of other physical processes to the observed fluctuations can not be ruled out . for example , large - scale variations in the curvature of the ambient magnetic field lines driven by ballooning instability prior to substorm associated dipolarization onsets can lead to fluctuations over the frequency range @xmath43 hz @xcite .",
    "this is also the frequency range over which the inverse cascade proposed by @xcite should occur .",
    "global instabilities , including magnetosphere - ionosphere coupling @xcite can also drive low - frequency waves . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the identification of low - frequency fluctuations is rather difficult or impossible when the whole length of event observations is comparable to the period of waves .",
    "it is even more difficult to detect the non - stationarity of low - frequency components over short intervals using wavelets . in this paper",
    "it is shown that the low - frequency components of fluctuations ( @xmath34 modes in figures 3 and 4 ) are non - stationary during the current disruption event of @xcite . as it was mentioned in section 2 non - stationarity of large - scale low - frequency waves",
    "manifests itself over high - frequencies in the wavelet spectrum , therefore the wavelet observations can not be fully trusted .",
    "there exist also physical reasons which makes the identification of turbulent cascades difficult .",
    "inverse or forward cascades in turbulence are related to local mode interactions in the fourier space .",
    "it is known that in the presence of a uniform magnetic field magnetohydrodynamic turbulence is neither isotropic nor local in fourier space @xcite . there",
    "exist experimental indications that such nonlocal interactions can occur near plasma boundaries with developed gradients @xcite .",
    "the near - earth location where cd and magnetic field dipolarization occurs represents a dynamically changing boundary between dipolar and more stretched field lines .",
    "spatial and temporal changes can be mixed up in one - spacecraft in - situ observations and the multi - scale signatures indicating the occurrence of an inverse cascade in the frequency domain misleading .",
    "we acknowledge nasa contract nas5 - 02099 and v. angelopoulos for use of data from the themis mission .",
