    "massive charged high - spin particles do exist in nature .",
    "particle colliders have produced unstable composite high - spin resonances like @xmath0(1670 ) , @xmath1(1690 ) or @xmath2(2040 ) , whose inverse size is of the same order as their mass .",
    "string theory also gives massive high - spin particles , with masses at least as large as the string scale , that may very well couple to a @xmath3 gauge field . in both cases",
    "the electrodynamics can be described by an effective field theory , which makes sense only below a finite cutoff not higher than the mass scale itself .",
    "one may wonder whether this is a generic feature of massive charged high - spin fields , or just particular to the above two examples .",
    "on the other hand , massive charged fields with @xmath4 are known to exhibit a variety of pathological features in a constant electromagnetic background in flat space  @xcite .",
    "the high - spin field may suffer from the so - called velo - zwanziger acausality  @xcite with modes that propagate superluminally , or the system even ceases to be hyperbolic , or the number of propagating degrees of freedom may be different from that of the free theory , or the cauchy problem may become ill - posed .",
    "one would like to know if the possible existence of a cutoff is related to all these pathologies .",
    "the coupling of _ massless _ high - spin particles to electromagnetism or gravity is plagued by grave inconsistencies  @xcite , because of absence of conserved current invariant under the high - spin gauge symmetry . for gravitational and electromagnetic interactions",
    "this problem respectively starts from spin-5/2  @xcite , and spin-3/2 ( in flat space ) .",
    "in fact , there are strong constraints coming from no - go theorems  @xcite that forbid the existence of interacting massless particles with @xmath5 in minkowski space .",
    "the fact that charged high - spin resonances exist then implies that any local lagrangian describing electromagnetically interacting massive high - spin fields must be singular in the @xmath6 limit .    in the unitary gauge",
    "this massless singularity is not obvious at all .",
    "for example , if one starts with the singh - hagen lagrangian  @xcite for massive fields of arbitrary spin and introduces electromagnetic coupling by the minimal prescription @xmath7 , one only gets positive powers of the mass in the resulting lagrangian .",
    "propagators of the massive theory become singular in the massless limit because of high - spin gauge invariance , so that scattering amplitudes diverge . the best way to understand the mass singularity is to employ the stckelberg formalism , because it focuses precisely on the gauge modes responsible for bad high energy behavior .",
    "here one renders the massive free theory gauge invariant through the addition of auxiliary fields , which can always be set to vanish using the resulting gauge invariance .",
    "when the theory is coupled to a @xmath3 gauge field , one can make a judicious covariant gauge fixing to obtain diagonal kinetic operators . in this case , there exist non - renormalizable interaction terms involving auxiliary fields , which explicitly depend on inverse powers of the mass .    in this article",
    "we consider the simple but nontrivial case of massive spin-2 field coupled to electromagnetism in flat space . in section 2 we describe massive spin-2 field  la stckelberg , and follow the prescription outlined in  @xcite to show that the massless singularity can not be cured by any means .",
    "we quantify the essential degree of this singularity by finding an expression for the uv cutoff of the effective action in terms of the particle s mass and electric charge . in section 3",
    "we argue that , for a judicious choice of non - minimal interaction terms , the system may show pathologies only when one extrapolates the local effective description beyond its regime of validity .",
    "we draw concluding remarks in section 4 , and comment on the generalization of the results to arbitrary spin and to gravitational coupling .",
    "massive spin-2 electromagnetic interaction has been studied by various authors  @xcite . here",
    "we will always work in flat space .",
    "we start with the pauli - fierz lagrangian  @xcite for massive spin-2 field . @xmath8,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 .",
    "this lagrangian does not possess any manifest gauge invariance . now , by the field redefinition @xmath10 we introduce new ( stckelberg ) fields @xmath11 and @xmath12 to obtain the following gauge invariance ( stckelberg symmetry ) : @xmath13 the stckelberg fields are redundant , in that they can always be gauged away .",
    "yet they are useful since they allow us to unveil the dangerous degrees of freedom and interactions hidden inside the spin-2 action . in lagrangian  ( [ r1 ] )",
    "all the higher dimensional operators cancel by the commutativity of partial derivatives .",
    "in fact one can obtain the stckelberg version of the pauli - fierz lagrangian just by kaluza - klein reducing the ( 4 + 1)d linearized einstein - hilbert action to ( 3 + 1)d  @xcite .",
    "all the fields @xmath14 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 then originate from a single higher dimensional massless spin-2 field , and the higher dimensional gauge invariance gives rise to the stckelberg symmetry  ( [ r3]-[r5 ] ) in lower dimension .",
    "electromagnetic coupling is introduced by complexifying the fields and replacing ordinary derivatives with covariant ones . @xmath15",
    "-m^2[\\tilde{h}_{\\mu\\nu}^ * \\tilde{h}^{\\mu\\nu}-\\tilde{h}^*\\tilde{h}]-\\frac{1}{4}\\,f_{\\mu\\nu}^2,\\ ] ] where @xmath16 , the covariant counterpart of  ( [ r2 ] ) , @xmath17 is trivially invariant under the gauged version of the symmetry  ( [ r3]-[r5 ] ) .",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite also considered a gauge invariant description to investigate consistent interactions of massive high - spin fields . in case of spin-2 ,",
    "say , they introduce stckelberg fields only in the mass term .",
    "this procedure already breaks stckelberg invariance at tree level , but our approach by construction guarantees that stckelberg symmetry is intact by the minimal substitution .",
    "next , we diagonalize the kinetic operators to make sure that the propagators in the theory have good high energy behavior , i.e. , that all propagators are proportional to @xmath18 for momenta @xmath19 .",
    "the field redefinition @xmath20 eliminates some kinetic mixings , and also generates a kinetic term for @xmath12 with the correct sign . adding the gauge fixing terms : @xmath21 , and @xmath22",
    ", we exhaust all gauge freedom to obtain diagonal kinetic terms .",
    "we are left with @xmath23 here @xmath24 contains all interaction terms , among which there exist higher dimensional operators , thanks to the non - commutativity of covariant derivatives .",
    "the most potentially dangerous non - renormalizable operators in the high energy limit @xmath25 are the ones with the highest dimensionality .",
    "parametrically in @xmath26 , for any given operator dimensionality , the @xmath27-terms are more dangerous than the others .",
    "we have @xmath28+\\frac{e}{m^3}f^{\\mu\\nu}[i(2\\partial_\\mu b^*_\\rho\\partial^\\rho\\partial_\\nu\\phi-\\partial_\\mu b_\\nu^*\\box\\phi)+\\text{c.c.}]+~( ... ),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( ... ) stands for less divergent terms .",
    "the @xmath27 dimension-8 operator is proportional the maxwell equations ; it can be eliminated by a local field redefinition : @xmath29 , where @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "this introduces @xmath31-terms : @xmath32 ^ 2 $ ] , which must be canceled as well . indeed , adding the local function : @xmath33 ^ 2 $ ] to the lagrangian serves the purpose .",
    "but now we will have terms proportional to @xmath34 , coming both from @xmath35 , and from the shift of @xmath36 acting on the dimension-7 operator in  ( [ r9 ] ) .",
    "the latter gives @xmath37 notice that any _ local _ function of the spin-2 field @xmath16 is fully invariant under the special stckelberg symmetry : @xmath38 where @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 are constant tensors .",
    "now the operators in eq .",
    "( [ r10 ] ) , being invariant only up to a nontrivial total derivative , can not be eliminated by adding local functions of @xmath16 .",
    "we must have terms proportional to @xmath34 .    on the other hand , mere addition of a dipole term",
    "leaves us only with terms proportional to @xmath42 , which is already an improvement over field redefinition plus addition of local term .",
    "indeed , a dipole term @xmath43 gives @xmath44+\\frac{e}{m^3}\\,f^{\\mu \\nu}[-2i\\alpha\\partial_{(\\mu}b^*_{\\rho)}\\partial^\\rho \\partial_\\nu\\phi+\\text{c.c.}]+( ... )\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] if we choose @xmath45 , the dimension-8 operators at @xmath27 all cancel leaving us only with dimension-7 operators . in the scaling limit : @xmath25 , @xmath46 , such that @xmath42=constant , the non - minimal lagrangian reduces to : @xmath47}^*\\partial^\\rho\\partial_\\nu\\phi -\\partial_{[\\mu}b_{\\nu]}^*\\box\\phi\\right\\}+ \\text{c.c.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these operators contain pieces that are not proportional to the equations of motion .",
    "therefore the degree of divergence could not have been improved further .",
    "thus our theory has an intrinsic model - independent cutoff  @xcite : @xmath48 here we notice the curious fact that the lagrangian ( [ r13 ] ) has acquired a @xmath3 gauge invariance for the vector stckelberg @xmath49 .",
    "this is because an appropriately chosen dipole term cancels not only the @xmath27 dimension-8 operator , but also any @xmath27 dimension-7 operators that get generated from a transformation @xmath50 .",
    "all the pathologies of interacting high - spin system originate from a gauge invariance in the kinetic part of the free lagrangian , which implies the existence of zero modes . in electromagnetic backgrounds",
    "the zero modes acquire non - vanishing but non - canonical kinetic term , which may cause some of them to propagate faster than light , or even lose hyperbolicity .",
    "the stckelberg formalism is tailored to single out the dynamics of precisely these gauge modes , which are nothing but the stckelberg fields . for the case of massive spin-2 , to simplify our analysis we set the @xmath49 field on shell . by doing this",
    "we can only check if the scalar @xmath12 exhibits non - standard dynamics . in a _ constant _ electromagnetic background @xmath12 will experience a new effective background metric , different from minkowski , because of some @xmath31 dimension-8 operators  @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is a generic dipole coefficient .",
    "@xmath53 is proportional to the minkowski metric for @xmath54 , so that @xmath12 propagates at the speed of light .",
    "but even for this value of @xmath52 the system ceases to be hyperbolic in a strong field ; precisely when @xmath55 . by computing the characteristic speeds one finds that the choice @xmath56 is downright pathological  @xcite , because it gives superluminal propagation even for infinitesimally small values of the background fields .",
    "other values of @xmath52 are safe for sufficiently weak external fields , and pathologies exist only in strong external fields : @xmath57 . but",
    "this is already beyond the regime of validity of our effective field theory . in that dynamical regime",
    ", pathologies may be cured by new degrees of freedom or strong coupling phenomena .",
    "the stckelberg method is powerful in that it clarifies the dynamics of interacting high - spin fields .",
    "here we analyzed a simple high - spin system : a spin-2 field coupled to electromagnetism and found that the theory must have an intrinsic uv cutoff , no higher than @xmath58 .",
    "the pathologies manifest themselves in the scalar stckelberg sector .",
    "however we saw that , for a judicious choice of non - minimal interaction terms , they appear in a regime where we can no longer trust our effective field theory description , at least in the scalar sector .    generalizations of this example to arbitrary spin @xmath59 is also being done  @xcite . starting from spin-5/2 the story",
    "gets complicated by the presence of auxiliary fields that are not ( gamma)traces of the high - spin field .",
    "the cutoff turns out to be no higher than @xmath60 .",
    "this result rules out long - lived high - spin charged particles , and thus may affect directly the strategy for their search in future colliders .",
    "gravitational coupling of high - spin fields is also very important ; it should be relatively straightforward in our formalism .",
    "existence of an intrinsic cutoff in this case will signal the ultimate limit of any local effective field theory description of interacting massive high - spin fields .",
    "does the existence of a uv cutoff necessarily call for new physics ?",
    "suppose some nontrivial uv fixed point exists  @xcite .",
    "then it means that the theory can be resummed , so that the massless limit will be smooth . while this might be true for a spin-2 field with non - minimal electromagnetic interaction , absence of smooth massless limit starting from spin-5/2  @xcite rules out such a possibility for higher - spins .",
