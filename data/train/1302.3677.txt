    "graphene is a promising material which has received intensive attention both theoretically and experimentally due to its excellent transport and optical properties.@xcite especially , its linear band structure and zero band gap lead to unique optical and electrical properties , making it suitable for various optoelectronic applications.@xcite a comprehensive understanding of the optical and electrical properties is one of the prerequisites for its potential applications .",
    "experimentally , the time - resolved pump - probe measurement is widely used to investigate the dynamics of carriers in graphene.@xcite with this method , both the differential reflection and the differential transmission ( dt ) after pump are measured.@xcite in the experiments with medium photoexcited electron density @xmath0 ( around @xmath1  @xmath2 ) and probe - photon energy much higher than the equilibrium fermi energy , the positive dt is often observed with its fast relaxation of several hundred femtoseconds followed by a slower picosecond relaxation.@xcite the mechanism leading to these two distinct relaxations is attributed to the rapid carrier - phonon thermalization and the slow decay of hot phonons , respectively.@xcite on the other hand , in recent years , experiments with higher photoexcited electron densities ( @xmath3  @xmath4)@xcite show that a negative dt appears when the probe - photon energy ( @xmath5  mev ) is much higher than the equilibrium fermi energy.@xcite such negative dt was usually claimed to arise from the renormalization of the single particle energy by the electron - electron coulomb hartree - fock contribution.@xcite it is noted that although the observed dt with high probe - photon energy and low photoexcited electron density is usually positive , negative dt was also reported with @xmath6  @xmath4 by plochocka _",
    "_ where the sample is 70 - 100 layer epitaxial graphene exhibiting the dirac - type electron spectrum.@xcite in contrast to the negative dt with probe - photon energy much higher than equilibrium fermi energy , other types of negative dts with lower probe - photon energy have already been observed in previous works.@xcite sun _ et al .",
    "_ reported the appearance of the negative dt under weak pump intensity with the probe - photon energy between 528 to 697 mev,@xcite which is lower than twice of the fermi energy ( @xmath7  mev ) .",
    "this negative dt was suggested to come from the weakening of the pauli blocking due to the heating of the electrons by the pump pulse.@xcite however , this claim has not yet been verified by the microscopic theoretical approach .",
    "soon after that , the negative dt was also observed by george _",
    "_ in the case when the probe - photon energy is as low as a few tens of mev ( with the frequency about several terahertz).@xcite with such low probe - photon energy , the increase of the intraband absorption is assumed to be responsible for the negative dt.@xcite in addition to these phenomena , with the pump - probe method , the optical gain has also been reported in optically pumped graphene very recently.@xcite    in addition to these experimental works , many theoretical studies have been devoted to get a clear comprehension on the dynamics of photoexcited carriers and phonons.@xcite among these works , the simple rate equation approach@xcite assumes the establishment of the fermi distribution as a starting point and , therefore , fails to incorporate the pump process and the buildup of the fermi distribution .",
    "the widely used time - dependent boltzmann equation approach@xcite can fulfill the above aims but neglects the interband coherence,@xcite which should be very important during the pump process .",
    "more elaborative microscopic investigations with the interband coherence included have been carried out based on many - particle density - matrix approach.@xcite however , these theoretical investigations are still far away from completion , as stated in the following .    among those papers with the interband coherence included,@xcite the scattering terms under the markovian approximation with the coulomb screening in the static limit are applied .",
    "nevertheless , with the static screening , the electron - electron coulomb scattering diverges when the initial and final states of the scattered electrons satisfy the condition @xmath8,@xcite where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the differences in momentum and energy between the initial and final states , respectively . to avoid this divergence , in these papers",
    ", the delta function originated from the markovian approximation and reflecting the energy conservation in the coulomb scattering term , was replaced by a lorentzian function with the broadening attributed to the non - markovian effect.@xcite nevertheless , under the more natural dynamic screening,@xcite this broadening is not needed .",
    "this is because that the dynamic screening also diverges in a higher order when @xmath11,@xcite and therefore reduces the original divergent scattering amplitudes to zero .",
    "another important issue frequently investigated is the influence of the auger process . in previous works ,",
    "the interband coherence was neglected and the auger process was defined as the process that one of the two scattered electrons is transferred from one band to the other while the other electron remains in the same band.@xcite in the works by winzer _",
    "et al._,@xcite such process was particularly stressed . however , under the dynamic screening , this auger process is totally forbidden because it also satisfies the strong restriction @xmath8 due to the energy and momentum conservation .",
    "however , in the case with the optical transition , the interband coherence is generated . with the interband coherence ,",
    "there are coulomb scattering processes with three out of the four band indices in the coulomb interaction hamiltonian being the same and the left one being different .",
    "this is also a kind of auger process .",
    "however , the influence of such process has not been addressed in the literature .    finally , in the microscopic equations obtained based on the many - particle density - matrix framework by knorr _",
    "et al._,@xcite the pump term was obtained under the vector potential gauge .",
    "however , the drift term which describes the acceleration of the electrons by the electric field is not included .",
    "the drift term may be unimportant when the pump - photon energy is very high as investigated in these works .",
    "nevertheless , it can be expected to be important when the pump - photon energy is low . on the other hand , in the time - dependent boltzmann equation approach ,",
    "the drift term is included but the pump term in the equation has to be introduced based on a fermi - golden - rule  like approximation and hence is suitable only for a weak pump intensity.@xcite moreover , the rabi flopping@xcite is absent in this approach .",
    "therefore , a general equation based on the microscopic many - particle density - matrix approach that includes both the drift and pump terms naturally is needed .    in this paper , we perform a microscopic investigation on the dynamics of photoexcited carriers and phonons in graphene by setting up and solving the kinetic bloch equations with the electron - phonon , electron - impurity and electron - electron coulomb scatterings explicitly included.@xcite in our study , the dynamic screening@xcite is adopted in the coulomb scattering .",
    "moreover , with the gauge invariant approach,@xcite both the drift and pump terms are obtained naturally .",
    "we look into the dynamics of carriers photoexcited by the linear polarized laser pulses with the pump - photon energy in both near - infrared and thz regimes under medium pump intensity . when the pump - photon energy is high enough , the influence of the drift term is shown to be negligible compared to that from the pump process . moreover , the anisotropic photoexcited electrons tend to be isotropic under the scattering and an isotropic hot - electron fermi distribution is established before the end of the pulse investigated here . on the contrary , when the pump - photon energy is low , the drift term causes a net momentum transfer from the electric field to electrons .",
    "together with the dominant coulomb scattering , a drifted fermi distribution is established in several hundred femtoseconds . moreover , the form of the drifted fermi distribution differs from the one obtained under static electrics field.@xcite besides , we also show that the temporal evolution of the dt measured by hale _",
    "_ can be well fitted with our microscopic calculation.@xcite in addition , although the auger process involving only the diagonal terms of the density matrices is forbidden by the dynamic screening , we show that the auger process involving the interband coherence still contributes to the dynamics of carriers . however , its contribution is important only when the pump - photon energy is low .",
    "similarly , it is shown that the terms neglected in the rotation - wave approximation,@xcite which is widely accepted in semiconductor optics , also become important in the case of low pump energy .",
    "we also investigate the dynamics of phonons . due to the linearly polarized pump pulse ,",
    "the @xmath9-resolved hot - phonon temperatures are anisotropic .",
    "moreover , the anisotropic hot - phonon temperatures under high pump energy are very different from those under low pump energy .",
    "finally , we investigate the negative dt by fitting the temporal evolution of dt in the experimental work by sun _",
    "et al._.@xcite our results support their suggestion that the negative dt comes from the weakening of the pauli blocking due to the heating of the electrons by the pump pulse .",

    "it is shown that the thermalization is weakened with the increase of the pump - photon energy and it is even negligible when the pump - photon energy is higher than 500  mev . moreover",
    ", a peak appears in the impurity density dependence of the thermalization .",
    "then , the dynamics of carriers and phonons with the pump - photon energy up to the near - infrared regime is studied .",
    "we show that the temporal evolution of the dt reported by hale _",
    "et al._@xcite can be well fitted .",
    "moreover , under the linearly polarized laser pulse , the electrons are photoexcited anisotropically .",
    "however , their distribution tends to be isotropic under the scattering . as a result",
    ", the isotropic hot - electron fermi distribution is found to be established within @xmath198  fs , which is before the end of the pulse ( the fwhm of the pulse is 180  fs ) .",
    "this is consistent with the previous works.@xcite in contrast to the high pump - photon energy case , in the case with the pump - photon energy down to the terahertz regime , we show that a large net momentum is transferred to electrons through the drift term and a drifted fermi distribution different from the one under static field is established in several hundred femtoseconds.@xcite we further show that the auger process investigated in the previous works@xcite which only involves the diagonal terms of density matrices is forbidden by the dynamic screening .",
    "however , the auger process involving the interband coherence contributes to the dynamics of carriers . nevertheless , its influence is important only when the pump - photon energy is low .",
    "in contrast , for the rotation - wave approximation which is widely accepted in semiconductor optics , we show that it fails when the pump energy is low .",
    "we also apply our microscopic theory to investigate the negative dt in the case where the equilibrium fermi energy is high and the probe - photon energy is around twice of the fermi energy .",
    "we show that the negative dt appears due to the weakening of the pauli blocking under the pump pulse , which supports the suggestion by sun _",
    "_ in their experimental work.@xcite    in addition , the momentum - resolved hot - phonon temperatures are also studied .",
    "when the pump - photon energy is high , the hot phonon temperatures are anisotropic due to the linearly polarized laser field and the hottest phonons appear with their momentum in the direction perpendicular to the laser field @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , we also show that the electron - hole recombination due to the interband electron - phonon scattering is marginal in the first several hundred femtoseconds . on the other hand , when the pump - photon energy is low and the relaxation of the net momentum is slow , the hot - phonon temperatures are also highly anisotropic with the hottest and the coldest phonons appearing in the directions parallel and antiparallel to the drift velocity , respectively , due to the drifted fermi distribution of electrons .",
    "however , if the relaxation of the net momentum is fast as in the case with high impurity density , the hot - phonon temperatures become more isotropic .",
