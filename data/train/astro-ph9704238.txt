    "the age of galactic globular clusters ( gcs ) provides fundamental information about the age of the universe and the formation history of the galaxy .",
    "recent improvements in the input physics needed for computing stellar evolutionary models have revived theoretical work on low - mass stars and gc age determinations ( chaboyer & kim 1995 , mazzitelli et al .",
    "1995 , dantona et al .",
    "1997 , salaris et al .",
    "salaris et al .",
    "( 1997 - paper  i ) have shown that the age of the supposedly oldest clusters  the most metal - poor ones  is around 12 gyr .",
    "this age reduction with respect to earlier work ( e.g.  chaboyer et al .",
    "1992 , salaris et al .",
    "1993 ) has been identified to be mainly due to the use of an improved equation of state that includes non - ideal gas effects ( rogers et al .",
    "1996 ) .    after this initial work , which was motivated by a possible `` conflict over the age of the universe '' ,",
    "the next step is to address the question of galaxy formation .",
    "this means that one has to investigate many clusters and determine their ages , looking for correlations of age with cluster metallicity or galactocentric distance .",
    "the position of the turn - off ( to ) is the feature in the colour - magnitude - diagrams ( cmd ) of stellar clusters that is most sensitive to the age of the stellar population .",
    "the higher the cluster age , the less luminous and redder is the to .",
    "two differential quantities are suited as age indicators that are independent of reddening and distance : the brightness difference in @xmath2 magnitude between the to and the horizontal branch ( hb ) at the rr lyrae stars region , called the @xmath3 or vertical method ( see , e.g. , sandage & cacciari 1990 ; stetson et al .",
    "1996 for a review ) and the @xmath4 colour difference between the to and the base of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , called the @xmath5 or horizontal method ( see , e.g. , chieffi & straniero 1989 , vandenberg et al .",
    "1990 ) . in both cases",
    "the to position is differentially determined with respect to a cmd branch ( the hb or the rgb ) whose location is virtually independent of age in the case of old stellar populations .",
    "direct absolute age determinations based on the vertical method lead to a large spread in ages , which seems to be correlated with metallicity ( chaboyer et al .",
    "1996 ) . however , the quality and diverseness of the data do not favour this method .",
    "the horizontal method works best if all problems with theoretical effective temperatures ( convection theory , atmospheres ) and the conversion of theoretical quantities to observed colour and brightness are avoided .",
    "it therefore is very well suited for obtaining relative ages of clusters of similar metallicity , but absolute ages are very difficult to obtain .",
    "a combination of both methods seems therefore to be promising for an accurate determination of absolute and relative ages .",
    "clusters are inspected in groups of similar metallicity , and one or more suitable `` template '' clusters ( with homogeneous and good photometry for both to and hb region ) are chosen to determine an absolute age directly with the vertical method . then , the horizontal method is used for a differential comparison with other clusters of the same group .",
    "this is the approach we have chosen ( see also paper  i ) and it is similar to the one by richer et al .",
    "our work differs from their analysis in that we use the vertical method for determining the absolute ages by virtue of theoretical isochrones and zero - age horizontal - branch models , while their absolute ages were obtained by fitting bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) isochrones , without explicitly using theoretical hb models ; moreover we use new and improved stellar models ( see paper  i ) , taking into account the latest developments regarding stellar opacities and equation of state .",
    "the questions we want to address are : ( i ) what is the absolute age of one or more template cluster in each metallicity group ; ( ii ) how do @xmath5 differences between clusters within a group translate into age differences ?",
    "this information is necessary for the more global problem of whether there is an age spread between galactic clusters , and if so , whether it is correlated with metallicity .",
    "assessing clearly the existence of an age spread among gcs and of an age - metallicity relation is fundamental for understanding the formation of our galaxy .",
    "very recently chaboyer et al .   (",
    "1996 ) found strong evidence in favour of a spread in the ages of galactic gcs and an age - metallicity relationship . on the contrary , stetson et al .",
    "( 1996 ) concluded that there is no evidence for a significant spread in ages among clusters of similar metallicity and that the case concerning age differences between metallicity groups remains unsettled , while richer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that the most metal - poor clusters may be slightly older than clusters of higher metallicities .",
    "the results of the latter group are , however , neither inconsistent with a picture in which all clusters of all metallicities formed simultaneously . between the most metal - rich clusters",
    "there appears to be a considerable age spread of @xmath6 gyr ( vandenberg et al.1990 ) , and in addition a number of exceptional clusters were found in all investigations .    in the present paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to halo clusters - that means gcs with kinematic properties typical of the halo component of the galaxy - and try to answer both the questions concerning the distribution of ages within individual metallicity groups and between groups . in sect",
    ".  2 we will review our method used for determining absolute and relative cluster ages .",
    "3 contains our results for a large group of halo clusters , which are compared with the results by richer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) . in sect .",
    "4 the implications for the cluster age distribution are discussed , and a summary of our results follows in the final section .",
    "as in paper  i we rely on theoretical models for all evolutionary phases ; in particular we have computed stellar models from the main - sequence ( ms ) up to the zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) .",
    "the input physics employed in the models is the same as in paper  i : for the opacities we used a combination of the latest opal opacities ( rogers & iglesias 1992 ; iglesias & rogers 1996 ) and tables from d.  alexander ( alexander & ferguson 1994 ; alexander , private communication ) .",
    "the metal mixtures included identical @xmath7-element enhancement for all opacity tables .",
    "the equation of state consisted of the opal eos ( rogers , swenson & iglesias 1996 ) with extensions for the lowest temperatures and degenerate helium cores taken respectively from chieffi & straniero ( 1989 ) and straniero ( 1988 ) .",
    "diffusion of helium and heavy elements is not included in the calculations .",
    "the effect of diffusion on the ages obtained from our models is discussed in sect .",
    "2.4 , which is dedicated to the methods for determing absolute and relative ages .",
    "we computed stellar models for the following compositions : @xmath8 = ( 0.0002 , 0.230 ) , ( 0.0004 , 0.230 ) , ( 0.0006 , 0.232 ) ( 0.0008 , 0.232 ) , ( 0.001 , 0.233 ) , ( 0.0015 , 0.235 ) ( 0.002 , 0.236 ) , ( 0.004 , 0.242 ) .",
    "for @xmath9 we have taken a mean value of 3 ( as in bergbusch & vandenberg 1992 ; mazzitelli et al .",
    "the first two mixtures are those already used in paper  i. @xmath7-elements are always enhanced ( e.g.  @xmath10 = + 0.5 $ ] ) ; the total metal - abundance @xmath11 $ ] is about 0.2 - 0.3 dex higher than @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "stellar models with masses between 0.7 and @xmath13 were evolved from the zero - age main sequence up to the rgb .",
    "the mixing length has been calibrated as explained in paper  i. isochrones for different ages were computed from these evolutionary models .",
    "zahb models with varying envelope masses were calculated as described in paper  i.    similarily , the conversion from theoretical effective temperature and luminosity to observable colour @xmath4 and visual magnitude @xmath2 was done using the transformations of buser & kurucz ( 1978 , 1992 ) .      in this paper ( as in paper  i )",
    "we have used both the vertical and the horizontal method for determining the distribution of the halo gcs ages .",
    "the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques have been discussed extensively in many recent papers ( vandenberg et al .",
    "1990 , salaris et al .",
    "1993 , chaboyer et al.1996 ) .",
    "to summarize , the @xmath3 appears particularly suitable for the determination of the absolute clusters ages , since it is independent of the treatment of convection and is only weakly sensitive to metallicity .",
    "however , it can be safely applied only in the case of clusters with homogeneous photometry for both to and hb , and with a well populated horizontal part of the hb .",
    "clusters with only a blue , vertical hb are in principle excluded , because it is impossible to have observational estimates of the absolute hb luminosity in the rr lyrae region or to constrain the age from the fit of theoretical zahb models .",
    "the @xmath5 can in principle be applied to each kind of gc with sufficiently accurate photometry , since each gc shows a main - sequence to and an rgb .",
    "it is only weakly sensitive to metallicity , but absolute ages depend on the mixing length calibration and on the transformations from effective temperatures to colours .",
    "when all the problems related to the @xmath14 determination and the conversion to observed colours are minimized , as in the case of clusters with similar metallicities , the horizontal method turns out to be suitable for accurately determining the relative ages of clusters ( vandenberg et al .  1990 ,",
    "stetson et al .  1996 ) .",
    "since our goal is to study the distribution of ages of a well populated sample of halo gcs , one has to deal with clusters with very different hb types and with photometries not always extended up to the hb , or showing only a scarcely populated or blue hb .",
    "therefore , we have to apply a combination of both methods for getting the ages of the cluster sample .",
    "we have collected published ccd data for 25 halo clusters ( see table  1 ) , which span a wide range of metallicities , galactocentric distances and hb types , divided into four groups according to their metallicity .",
    "the first group spans the range @xmath15}<-1.6 $ ] ( metal poor clusters ) , the second @xmath16}<-1.3 $ ] ( intermediate metal poor clusters ) , the third @xmath17}<-0.9 $ ] ( intermediate metal rich clusters ) and the fourth @xmath18}<-0.6 $ ] ( metal rich clusters ) .",
    "the adopted @xmath19 $ ] values come from zinn ( 1985 ) , and the global metallicity has been obtained considering an average @xmath20=0.3 $ ] and @xmath21}={\\rm[fe / h]}+0.2 $ ] according to the discussion in paper  i. the metallicity difference among the clusters in each group is about a factor of 2 . in the case of rup106 , arp2 and ter7 ,",
    "for which there are no data in zinn ( 1985 ) , we have considered the @xmath22 $ ] estimates by buonanno et al ( 1993 , 1995a , 1995b ) to which we have added the contribution of the @xmath7-elements,$ ] scale , which corresponds to the zinn ( 1985 ) metallicity scale for almost all gcs in our sample .",
    "the new calibration is based on a homogeneous set of cluster @xmath23 $ ] determinations from high resolution spectroscopic data ; it provides @xmath19 $ ] values for the clusters in our sample that are on average 0.20 dex higher than the ones we used .",
    "this simply corresponds to an almost constant shift of the @xmath24 $ ] ranges adopted for our gcs groups , but the membership of each single group does not change and similarly the absolute and relative ages we derive are only very marginally affected by the choice of this new scale ( see sect .  3 , which is about age determination ) . ]",
    "assuming that such an enrichment exists for these clusters as well .",
    "we have considered only clusters with photometries that show at least ms , to and rgb , and that permit a clear determination of the to position ( within an error @xmath250.15 mag ) . in each group one cluster ( or two clusters , if possible ) is selected as the `` reference '' one , and its absolute age is determined directly by means of the vertical method ; the photometry of the reference cluster has to show not only a clearly defined to position , but also the rgb and a well - populated hb of such morphology that the zahb level can be safely determined .",
    "thus , cmd morphology is more important than the overall quality of the photometry for a cluster to be suitable as a reference cluster .    within each group",
    "the relative ages with respect to the reference cluster are determined by means of the horizontal method . where there are two reference clusters the age difference from the vertical method can be cross - checked with that derived by means of the horizontal one .",
    "the advantage of using the vertical method for determining the absolute age of a cluster is that it is largely independent of all uncertainties connected with the calculation of effective temperatures and their conversion to colours .",
    "it does not depend on the reddening and on the assumed distance modulus ( the same holds , of course , also for the horizontal method ) , although the models yield a distance scale ( by means of the comparison between observed and theoretical zahb level ) , which can be compared to independently determined values .    to obtain the cluster age ,",
    "the procedure is the following : from the observed brightness of hb stars the apparent zahb brightness is derived ( see below ) ; with the to - brightness as given by the observers , @xmath26 is determined uniquely and is compared to theoretical predictions of @xmath26 as a function of age for isochrones and zahb models of the appropriate metallicity .",
    "these steps are sufficient to find the cluster age .",
    "however , one can go beyond this to check the reliability of the results .",
    "first , the difference between observed apparent and theoretical absolute zahb brightness gives the distance modulus following from our models , which can be compared to independent determinations from other distance indicators ; thus , the distance modulus provides an independent way to assess the reliability of the derived ages .",
    "second , the isochrone can be compared to the cmd .",
    "since age and @xmath27 already have been fixed , isochrones ( and zahb models ) remain to be shifted in colour to match the observed ms .",
    "this shift corresponds to the cluster reddening @xmath28 .",
    "the overall fit to the observed cmd may serve as an additional qualitative indicator .",
    "there is , however , the following point to be taken into account : since our age determination method does not rest on detailed isochrone fitting , we have taken the metallicity directly from the literature , without trying to improve the fit by exploring the error range in [ m / h ] .",
    "changing the metallicity within the allowed range can improve the isochrone fit ( see sect .",
    "3.2 ) without affecting appreciably the determined age .",
    "an important step in the vertical method is therefore to fix the zero - age level of the observed hb . in paper",
    "i we selected two clusters ( m68 and m15 ) with well - populated hbs and a sufficiently large number of rr  lyrae variables . with the mean brightness ( @xmath29 ) of the variables fixed , we derived the zero - age level using the relation by carney et al .",
    "( 1992 ) :    @xmath30 + 0.20 \\label{vzahb}\\ ] ]    we have also demonstrated in paper  i that ( assuming a constant helium content of @xmath31 ) our theoretical relation between zahb brightness ( taken at @xmath32 ) and @xmath12 $ ] together with eq .",
    "[ vzahb ] agrees nicely with that found empirically by clementini et al .",
    "( 1995 ) and also supports that of walker ( 1992a ) .",
    "the reader is referred to paper  i for a deeper discussion about the problem of the true observational relation between rr  lyrae luminosities and metallicity . in the present paper",
    "we consider an initial helium abundance varying with @xmath33 , but the difference with the zahb luminosities obtained in paper  i is always less than 0.04 mag ( reached at the highest metallicities considered ) . in fig .",
    "[ theorhb ] we show the final relation between zahb luminosity and @xmath12 $ ] from our stellar models ; in the same figure the empirical relations by clementini et al .",
    "( 1995 - when considering only zahb objects ) and walker ( 1992a ) are also displayed ( upper and lower limits according to the errors given by the authors ) .",
    "the agreement between the zahb theoretical models and both empirical determinations is evident .",
    "very recently , first results on the absolute luminosity of hb ( feast & catchpole 1997 ; de boer et al .",
    "1997 ) and subdwarfs stars ( reid 1997 ; gratton et al .",
    "1997 ) based on hipparcos data have appeared .",
    "the implications of the latter papers for the distances to m68 and m5 we will discuss in the respective sections . feast & catchpole ( 1997 ) used the trigonometric parallaxes of galactic cepheid variables for recalibrating the zero - point of the period - luminosity relation . after applying a correction for metallicity effects ,",
    "they derive a distance modulus of @xmath34 for the lmc , almost 0.20 mag higher than the value commonly used , based on a previous cepheids calibration and on other distance indicators ( see , e.g. walker 1992a ) .",
    "this distance modulus , coupled with the rr lyrae observations by walker ( 1992a ) for lmc clusters , provides a mean absolute magnitude @xmath35 at [ fe / h]=-1.9 for rr lyrae stars ; this value corresponds , by applying eq .",
    "[ vzahb ] , to @xmath36 . from our theoretical models",
    "we get an absolute zahb luminosity @xmath37 at the instability strip for the same metallicity .",
    "this means that our theoretical value would be higher than the upper limit of the observationally allowed range ( 0.46 ) by 0.05 mag .",
    "the opposite conclusion can be reached when considering the results by de  boer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , again based on hipparcos parallaxes ; they present absolute @xmath2 magnitudes for a group of hb field halo stars , bluer than the instability strip .",
    "we consider for example the reddest star in their sample ( hd161817 ) , which is also the object with the smallest error on @xmath38 ( the errors for the other stars are much bigger , up to 1.25 mag ) .",
    "the observations give @xmath39 and @xmath40=0.14 .",
    "the metallicity of the objects is not given in the paper . by using our theoretical zahb models with",
    "@xmath41}=-1.03 $ ] ( as done by the authors when comparing their data with the zahb models by dorman 1992 ) we obtain @xmath42 at @xmath40=0.14 . if we consider the models with @xmath43}=-1.6 $ ] , which corresponds approximately to the average metallicity of field halo stars , we obtain @xmath44 .",
    "both values are in agreement with the observationally allowed range . if , however , we take into account the fact that hd161817 is likely to be evolved from the zahb towards higher luminosities ( as also noted by de  boer et al .",
    "1997 ) , then the theoretical models are more luminous than observationally allowed .",
    "therefore , the two papers discussed lead to discrepant results . compared to feast & catchpole ( 1997 )",
    "our predicted distance moduli appear to be too low ; compared to de  boer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) they are too large .",
    "the first results based on hipparcos data do not disprove the reliability of our theoretical zahb luminosities .    to determine the observational zahb brightness , the application of eq .",
    "1 requires good hb photometry and the presence of a sufficient number of rr  lyr stars .",
    "it was not possible for all metallicity groups to find a cluster fulfilling both requirements .",
    "therefore , we developed a method to determine the observational zahb level when the hb is well populated .",
    "this can be applied each time the observational hb is populated in the horizontal part , even if there are no stars in the instability strip .    theoretically , all observed hb stars should be at least as bright as the zahb .",
    "thus , the lower envelope ( for well - populated hbs ) to the observed hb provides a reasonable estimate for the zahb luminosity ( sandage 1990 ) . in practice , however , photometric errors , field stars and other objects not belonging to the hb will spread out this lower limit and a more statistical approach is necessary . to this end",
    "we have looked into the brightness - distribution of hb stars in a few colour bins . for each colour",
    "bin count histograms for brightness bins were created ; the brightness bins were typically 0.04 - 0.05 mag wide ( depending on the hb population ) .",
    "formally , we set the zahb level to the upper brightness of that bin which shows a decrease in star counts by a factor @xmath45 2 and where the brighter bins contain more than 90% of all candidate hb stars under consideration .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ hbhisto ] for m5 .",
    "for all the clusters to which we have applied the vertical method these two conditions were always fulfilled by the same luminosity bin . for m68 and m15 , our method reproduces the zahb levels at the rr  lyrae instability strip as determined by eq .",
    "[ vzahb ] ( paper  i ) within 0.01 mag , i.e.  within the binning error . in this paper",
    "we will adopt for m68 the zahb luminosity and the associated formal error ( the width of the luminosity bin ) determined with the new method ; the resulting absolute age is the same as in paper  i , but the formal error is lower ( see table  1 ) .",
    "note that the way we define the zahb level leads to a systematic overestimate of the zahb brightness of order half the bin width and consequently to ages slightly too high ; the uncertainty , however , remains below @xmath46 0.04 - 0.05 mag .    to check the influence of the chemical composition on our vertical - method age estimates",
    ", we have shown in paper  i ( but see also salaris et al .",
    "1994 ; chaboyer 1995 ) that a variation of the metallicity by a factor of 2 or the use of an initial helium abundance @xmath47 different by 0.01 in the theoretical isochrones changes the derived ages by slightly less than 1 gyr . when taking into account also helium and heavy element diffusion , contrary to our expectations expressed in paper  i , the vertical - method ages derived decrease by less than 1 gyr because of balancing effects on to and zahb ( castellani et al .",
    "1996 ) .      in deriving the relative gc ages we have applied the horizontal method , following the procedure presented by vandenberg et al .",
    "the ridge lines of two clusters are shifted horizontally in order to match their to colours , and then vertically to force coincidence between the main sequences at a position 0.05 mag redder than the to .",
    "differences in the rgb colour ( fixed for example at a point 2.5 mag more luminous than the ms reference point ) correspond to age differences derived from our new theoretical isochrones . as already discussed by vandenberg et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , the precise point on the rgb is of little significance , since the rgbs run essentially parallel to one another .",
    "we have evaluated _ mean _ @xmath5 differences from the cluster fiducials by considering , when possible , a magnitude range along the rgb of typically 0.5 - 1.0 mag ( depending on the extension of the fiducial line ) , starting approximately from the point 2.5 mag more luminous than the ms reference point .",
    "the formal error of the relative ages derived by means of this procedure , estimated from the uncertainty in measuring the shift in the position of the rgb with respect to the reference cluster is about 0.5 gyr .    as for the reliability of the age",
    "scaling derived adopting the @xmath5 technique , the following points have to be mentioned :    \\i ) a comparison of the @xmath5 scaling with respect to the age at fixed global metallicity , by adopting the oxygen - enhanced bergbusch & vandenberg ( 1992 ) , the scaled - solar straniero & chieffi ( 1991 ) and our own isochrones shows a good agreement in spite of different codes , different effective temperature normalization and/or completely different input physics and heavy element distribution .",
    "the relative ages obtained in the three cases differ by no more than 20% .",
    "\\ii ) the effect of a variation in the initial helium content is almost negligible .",
    "a variation of @xmath48 induces a change in the relative ages of only @xmath49 gyr .    \\iii ) a variation in the global metallicity by a factor of 2 changes the relative ages by less than 0.5 gyr .",
    "\\iv ) a global change of the mixing length parameter @xmath50 for each metallicity affects _ absolute _ ages derived by means of the horizontal method much more than the _ relative _ ones .",
    "a variation of @xmath50 by @xmath51 changes the relative ages by 0.10 - 0.15 gyr only , while changing the absolute ages by @xmath46 1 gyr .",
    "\\v ) the influence of the helium and heavy element diffusion on the relative ages obtained by means of the horizontal method is almost negligible ( cassisi 1996 , private communication ) .",
    "a check at @xmath52 shows that the age differences determined with and without including diffusion agree within 10% .",
    "\\vi ) the scaling of @xmath5 with respect to the age is independent of the absolute age only for ages higher than a certain value ( depending on the metallicity ) . below this limit ,",
    "which , for example , is around 11 - 12 gyr at @xmath52 , the age differences depend on the absolute ages assumed for the reference clusters ; it is therefore important to fix the absolute age of the reference cluster within each group by means of the vertical method .",
    "in this section we will discuss separately the absolute and relative age determinations of the clusters within each of the four metallicity groups .",
    "all the selected clusters , their metallicity , hb type , galactocentric distance ( @xmath53 ) , the derived zahb luminosity ( and the associated error ) for the reference clusters , relative and absolute ages ( with their formal errors ) , are displayed in table  1 .",
    "the zahb luminosities refer to the instability strip for m68 and to the red boundary of the instability strip for ngc6584 , ngc3201 and m5 , which have a well developed hb but no homogeneus rr lyrae photometry . in the case of ngc6171 and ngc6652 the zahb luminosity corresponds to the red hb .",
    "the hb types come from chaboyer et al .",
    "an evaluation of the galactocentric distances ( in kpc ) has been obtained by applying the following equation :    @xmath54    where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the cluster galactic coordinates , @xmath57 ( using @xmath58=3.3e(b - v ) ) , and the sun s galactocentric distance is set to @xmath59=8.0 kpc .",
    "the apparent distance moduli were obtained using our theoretical zahb models and the zahb luminosities given in table 1 for the reference clusters , or the average hb magnitudes given by chaboyer et al.(1996 ; in the case of ngc6366 the average hb luminosity comes from alonso et al .",

    "( 1996 ) for all others .",
    "a simple estimate of the formal error in the absolute age for the reference clusters is obtained as in paper  i , by statistically adding the formal uncertainties on the zahb level ( displayed in table 1 ) and on the to luminosity ( as derived from the original papers ) in order to obtain the error in the observed @xmath3 value ; this error is then transformed into an uncertainty in the age by using the theoretical isochrones .",
    "for the other clusters the formal error in the relative ages derived by means of the horizontal method ( see the previous section ) is statistically added to the error in the age of the corresponding reference cluster .    at this point",

    "the size of the true age range ( @xmath122 ) can be estimated according to @xmath123 , where @xmath124 is the sigma of the actual data , and @xmath125 is the sigma of the expected distribution ( chaboyer et al .",
    "1996 ) ; we obtain @xmath122=1.2 gyr .    as for an age - metallicity relation , a formal linear fit to the data yields    @xmath126}+(5.94\\pm0.77 ) .",
    "\\label{tm1}\\ ] ]    the linear pearson correlation coefficient is -0.80 , implying that the confidence level for a linear correlation between age and @xmath24 $ ] is not high .",
    "the correlation coefficient for the relation between age and @xmath127 is even lower ( -0.34 ) .",
    "a visual inspection of fig .  [ tdist ] confirms that there is only an indication that the youngest clusters , with the exception of ngc6652 , seem to be located in the outer halo .    to summarize , when considering all the clusters in our sample ( except ngc6366 )",
    ", we find an age spread among the gcs ( @xmath122=1.2 gyr ) , but no statistically compelling evidence for either an age - metallicity or an age-@xmath53 relation .",
    "there is however an indication that the more metal - poor clusters are on average older then the clusters of higher metallicities , and that the age spread within each metallicity bin tends to be higher for increasing metallicities .",
    "our analysis based on new stellar models therefore confirms the results of richer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) in this respect .",
    "recently , lin & richer ( 1992 ) and buonanno et al .",
    "( 1994 ) have suggested that pal12 , rup106 , arp2 and ter7 ( which appear to be younger than other clusters of approximately the same metallicity ) could have been captured by the milky way from a companion galaxy , and therefore represent later infall events . in this case",
    "they could not be indicative of the halo formation phase .",
    "this argument is based mainly on the fact that these four clusters appear to lie along a single great circle passing through the northern tip of the magellanic stream , thus suggesting a common orbit that could be the result of an accretion event from a companion galaxy .",
    "although it is clear that proper motion studies are necessary for a definitive answer , the argument is reinforced by the fact that ter7 and arp2 lie very close to the sagittarius dwarf galaxy ( but see also the discussion in chaboyer et al .",
    "1996 ) , which is currently being tidally disrupted and absorbed by the milky way .",
    "if this is the case , the previous statistical analysis should be performed excluding these 4 objects from our halo gcs sample .",
    "furthermore , from fig .  [ tmetal ]",
    "it is evident that there are only two clusters of the metal - rich group left  m107 and ngc6652 ( at respectively 11 and 8 gyr ) . in the following",
    "we will give results in brackets for the case when m107 and ngc6652 are neither taken into account , and therefore the highest metallicity clusters are disregarded completely .",
    "the average age of the remaining 20 ( 18 ) clusters is then @xmath128 ( 11.0 ) gyr ( @xmath114=1.2 ( 1.1 ) gyr ) , which is slightly older , but has a much narrower distribution than the complete sample .",
    "the correlation coefficient between age and metallicity is almost -0.82 ( -0.86 ) , which is the same as for the 24 clusters .",
    "the f - test reveals that the `` coeval '' hypothesis can be rejected with a lower confidence level of @xmath4670% ( 25% ) ; the derived formal @xmath122 is equal to 0.5 ( 0.2 ) gyr , less than half of @xmath122 for the complete sample .",
    "we therefore conclude that , once pal12 , rup106 , arp2 and ter7 are excluded , the genuine halo clusters formed within @xmath129 gyr of each other .",
    "our smallest sample is therefore coeval and the one including m107 and ngc6652 can not be excluded to be so as well .",
    "the formal linear regression to this sample gives @xmath130}+(7.03\\pm0.66)$ ] .",
    "our results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we have determined the ages of a sample of 25 halo clusters by use of stellar models which take into account all recent improvements in stellar input physics data .",
    "the method for obtaining ages is a combination of the @xmath3-method for a few `` reference '' clusters and the @xmath5-method for other clusters of a similar metallicity .",
    "the clusters are split into four groups according to simila metallicity .",
    "3 .   our results , summarized in table  1 , confirm that gcs are @xmath131 gyr old or younger , as we already claimed in paper  i for a subset of three metal - poor clusters",
    ". the lower ages as compared to previous investigations are due to our new stellar physics input and our purely theoretical approach for the hb luminosities .",
    "4 .   since age differences depend on absolute age , we obtain smaller age differences for a given @xmath5 .",
    "therefore our sample becomes more homogeneous even if we use the same original data as in previous papers .",
    "this applies , e.g. , for rup106 and arp2 with respect to m68 .",
    "5 .   several cross checks ( e.g.  for rup106 )",
    "result in consistent ages .",
    "ngc6366 is the oldest cluster of our sample with @xmath132 gyr , but the photometry for this cluster might be affected by differential reddening , so we excluded it from the analysis in sect .  4 .",
    "the next oldest cluster is m30 with @xmath133 .",
    "we confirm earlier results that the metal - poor clusters form a very coeval group and that the more metal - rich groups show a larger age spread .",
    "8 .   for the whole sample , which has not been selected on any specific grounds except that the photometric quality should allow the application of our age determination methods",
    ", we obtain a mean age of @xmath134 gyr ( @xmath61-error ) and reject the assumption that all clusters are coeval . a linear correlation between metallicity and age",
    "is not confirmed .",
    "9 .   for samples with all `` peculiar '' and metal - rich clusters excluded ,",
    "the mean age becomes better defined ( @xmath135 gyr ) .",
    "the age range of a large sample of clusters with the same average age and individual errors as ours would be only 0.2 gyr ( 1@xmath114 range ) .",
    "the clusters in this sample are coeval .",
    "this is still true , if we include m107 and ngc6652 , although the probability for this hypothesis is lower .",
    "whether or not the assumption of a common age can be rejected safely , depends critically on the inclusion of individual clusters .",
    "clearly , the sample size is too small for any reliable conclusions .",
    "there is no evidence for any correlation between age and galactocentric distance .",
    "known counter - examples against the hypothesis that age is the second parameter affecting hb morphology are confirmed .",
    "ngc288 and ngc362 have the same age . this result does not agree with richer et al.(1996 ) , and is due to new photometric data of ngc288 , but it is in agreement with the results by stetson et al .",
    "12 . other differences with respect to richer et al .",
    "( 1996 ) can be explained in terms of our new models , lower absolute ages , or different original data .",
    "we confirm and substantiate the results of richer et al.(1996 ) in large parts , although differences for individual clusters exist , and we determine significantly lower ages for all clusters . according to both investigations the more metal - poor gcs all formed within 1 gyr and throughout the whole halo .",
    "the more metal - rich systems possibly formed another gyr later and over a somewhat longer timescale .",
    "the cluster population is contaminated by a few clusters not fitting into this simple picture .",
    "consistent and high - quality photometric data for a large sample of clusters is needed to confirm our results .",
