    "until now 45 extragalactic @xmath1-ray sources ( status october 1994 ) have been clearly detected by the egret experiment aboard the compton observatory ( kanbach 1994 , thompson 1994 ) .",
    "several of them are also seen by the comptel and osse instruments ( kurfess 1994 ) .",
    "the broadband high energy spectra extend over four decades in energy and exhibit quite pronounced spectral forms and breaks .",
    "apart from the large magellanic cloud all extragalactic @xmath1-ray sources are radio - loud , have a compact core and are known as highly variable sources .",
    "a large fraction of these sources exhibit apparent superluminal motion .",
    "because of its rapid variability , its high compactness , lack of radio - quiet sources in the sample and high presence of superluminal motion sources it is generally agreed ( blandford 1993 , dermer 1993 , dermer and schlickeiser 1992 , dermer & gehrels 1995 ) that the @xmath6-ray emission originates in strongly beamed sources , in accord with the relativistic beaming hypothesis that has served well as the baseline model for the central engines of active galactic nuclei ( scheuer and readhead 1979 , blandford and knigl 1979 ) .",
    "dermer and schlickeiser ( 1993 ) - hereinafter referred to as ds - have demonstrated that at hard x - ray and @xmath1-ray frequencies inverse compton scattering of accretion disk photons by relativistic electrons and positrons in an outflow ing plasma with relativistic bulk motion ( bulk lorentz factor @xmath7 ) dominates over other radiation mechanisms .",
    "this @xmath1-ray production process succesfully explains the key observational features as ( i ) the peak of the bolometric luminosity at @xmath1-ray frequencies ( ii ) the @xmath1-ray variability time scale @xmath8 few days , ( iii ) the softening of the spectra between the hard x - ray and medium @xmath1-ray regime , ( iv ) the high percentage of superluminal sources in the sample , ( v ) the generation of tev emission for favourably aligned observers .",
    "it has been suggested ( henri , pelletier & roland 1993 ) that pair annihilation in relativistic electron - positron jets could be of considerable importance to such jet models .",
    "the purpose of this study is thus to extend the ds - model by including the @xmath1-ray production from pair annihilation radiation from relativistic jets . under the same assumptions as for the calculation of the inverse compton scattering from the jet we will determine the yield of annihilation radiation .",
    "of special interest will be the modelling of spectral breaks with a change in spectral index @xmath5 larger than 0.5 as detected in pks  0528 + 134 , @xmath9 and 3c273 , @xmath10 . in the original ds approach",
    "spectral breaks up to @xmath11 were obtained by incomplete inverse compton cooling of an injected power law during the time evolution of the @xmath1-ray flare . taking into account all spectral broadening effects due to the energy spectra of the annihilating particles and the bulk motion of the jet ,",
    "we show here that the contribution from this radiation component peaks near a few mev , and if it dominates the inverse compton component it may provide an explanation for the reported spectral maxima in this energy range .",
    "the jet model for the @xmath1-ray emission in agns of ds is illustrated in figure 1 .",
    "relativistic electrons and positrons , with isotropic energy distribution functions @xmath12 in the comoving frame at height @xmath13 above the accretion disk , f low outward along the disk symmetry axis with bulk lorentz factor @xmath14 and bulk velocity @xmath15 from an initial height @xmath16 .",
    "photons produced by the accretion disk pass through the jet and are compton upscattered to @xmath1-ray energi es @xmath17 ( see ds for details ) .",
    "the relativistic electrons and positrons fill not the whole jet but only an ( assumed ) spherical blob of radius @xmath18 .",
    "we follow the notation of ds : energies and angles without asterisks denote values in the comoving fluid frame , while these quantities with asterisks denote values in the stationary frame @xmath19 of the accretion disk .",
    "we do not include cosmological effects here .",
    "jet model for the @xmath20-ray emission in agns    to avoid heavy attenuation of the produced gev @xmath1-rays by pair production interactions with the accretion disk photons dermer and schlickeiser ( 1994 ) have pointed out that the initial height of the blob has to be larger than @xmath21 cm where @xmath22 denotes the accretion disk luminosity in units of @xmath23 erg / s and @xmath24 the accretion disk temperature in units of @xmath25 ev .",
    "such a high location of the blob is also consistent with the presence of many superluminal motion sources in the sample of @xmath1-ray blazars . at these heights the pair annihilation radiation freely escapes from the system and",
    "does not initiate a pair cascade ( lightman and zdziarski 1987 , zdziarski et al .",
    "1990 , protheroe et al . 1992 ) with plenty production of 511 kev annihilation line radiation from the cascade - cooled cold electron - positron pairs that is not observed from these objects ( kurfess 1994 ) . as in ds",
    "we start wit h initial relativistic power law energy spectra for the radiating particles    @xmath26    and follow the time evolution of the energy spectra under the various energy loss processes .",
    "these spectra are used to calculate the yield of annihilation radiation at various heights .",
    "we start our analysis with the calculation of the annihilation radiation emissivity .",

    "in the ultrarelativistic case , equation ( 12 ) simply becomes @xmath63 which is equivalent to the condition @xmath64 .",
    "unfortunately , equation ( 6 ) is still not analytically integrable , but for @xmath65 , it may be very well used for numerical calculations of the integral    @xmath66 @xmath67    ( svensson 1982 ) where the brackets denote the averaging over the distribution functions of electrons and positrons .    for further simplifications , we use the fact that in eq .",

    "we use this fact to approximate @xmath71 by constructing a function that satisfies the condition of these peak values and exhibits the same asymptotical behavior as found for @xmath71 .",

    "while the energy exchange processes discussed in section 4 , will keep the low - energy turnover of the distribution function at mildly relativistic values , @xmath228 , the wide dispersion in the doppler factor ( 47 ) values will imply a corresponding wide distribution in the value of the annihilation peak energy ( 48 ) .",
    "although we have made no detailed effort so far to optimize parameters to explain individual source spectra , it is evident that in principle the inclusion of the annihilation radiation is capable to explain emission maxima and spectral breaks at mev energies .",
    "the occurrence of spectral maxima between 1 and 10 mev for the sources 3c273 and 3c279 has been reported by recent comptel observations ( williams et al .",
    "an even more drastic example is the detection of the mev - blazar gro j0516 - 609 near pks 0506 - 612/0522 - 611 by bloemen et al .",
    "our spectral modelling confirms the suggestion of bloemen et al . that the mev emission in this object represents the broad blue - shifted annihilation line .",
    "a possible test for the hypothesis that the emission maxima in the observed @xmath1-ray energy spectra are due to blueshifted annihilation radiation is offered by the predicted relation between the maximum photon energy ( 48 ) and the total @xmath1-ray luminosity . making the strong assumption , that apart from the doppler factor all other intrinsic physical parameters of the sources are equal",
    ", the total pair annihilation luminosity will scale with the doppler factor as @xmath229 .",
    "a similar doppler factor dependence holds for the inverse - compton luminosity ( ds ) .",
    "combined with eq .",
    "( 48 ) this implies the relation @xmath230 i.e. the strong doppler boosting in bright objects also blueshifts the annihilation peak to high photon energies .",
    "relation between mev-@xmath20-ray peak energy and total @xmath20-ray luminosity for 33 agn detected by egret .",
    "we have used the available compilation of blazar energy spectra ( montigny et al .",
    "1995 ) to estimate both the @xmath20-ray luminosity @xmath231 and the maximum photon energy ( correcting for cosmological redshift ) , and the result is shown in fig . 13 in comparison with the predicted correlation ( 49 ) .",
    "the presently available data are not in contradiction with the hypothesis ( 49 )",
    ". a more stringent test would be possible if more agns with luminosities in the range @xmath232 are detected with well - resolved @xmath1-ray energy spectra .",
    "in this work we have calculated the contribution of the pair annihilation process in relativistic electron - positron jets to the @xmath0ray emission . under the same assumptions as for the calculation of the yield of the inverse compton scattered photons by relativistic particles in the jet ( dermer and schlickeiser 1993 ) we calculated the emerging pair annihilation radiation taking into account all spectral broadening effects due to the energy spectra of the annihilating particles and the bulk motion of the jet .",
    "we started from the pair annihilation reaction rate in relativistic plasmas ( svenson 1982 ) and developed a new asym ptotic approximation appropriate for relativistic pair energies which provides a very accurate approximation of the pair annihilation spectrum for all photon energies .",
    "the evolution of the particle energy spectra with time has been taken into account consistingly , discussing in detail the role of inverse compton losses , synchrotron losses , relativistic bremsstrahlung losses , pair annihilation losses and mller and bhabha thermalization . for typical blazar parameters",
    "two particle - number conserving loss processes dominate at large ( lorentz factor @xmath233 ) particle energies ( inverse compton losses ) and at very low ( lorentz factor @xmath234 ) energies ( thermalization ) , while the catastropic pair annihilation los ses reduce the number of radiating particles thus avoiding the `` dead - electron - problem '' ( begelman et al .",
    "we demonstrated that in spectral appearance the time - integrated pair annihilation spectrum appears almost like the well - known @xmath1-ray spectrum from decaying @xmath235-mesons at rest , since it yields a broad bumpy feature located between 50 and 100 mev .",
