    "installing roman pots of the pp2pp experiment  @xcite at star  @xcite detector at rhic will allow tagging events with very forward protons , thus extending physics reach of the experiment to select processes , in which the proton stays intact and the exchange has the quantum numbers of the vacuum .",
    "consequently , enhancing the probability of measuring reactions where colorless gluonic matter dominates the exchange .",
    "the processes include both elastic and inelastic diffraction .",
    "these processes are related to the photon diffraction that has already been studied by star in ultra peripheral collisions ( upc)of gold - gold ( auau ) , and deuteron - gold ( dau ) ions , where two pion , @xmath0 and four pion @xmath1 photoproduction has been used to probe pomeron - heavy nucleus couplings  @xcite .    in order to characterize those diffractive processes well ,",
    "the measurement of the momentum of the forward proton is important . because of the layout of star and its solenoidal magnetic field ,",
    "rhic accelerator magnets must be used for momentum analysis resulting in forward proton taggers installed downstream from the star detector , on either side .",
    "there are two possible locations : 1 ) warm section between the dx - d0 magnets ; or 2 ) in the warm straight section between q3 and q4 magnets , see fig .",
    "[ layout ] . also , to extend the @xmath2 and @xmath3 ranges to the lowest values , where @xmath2 is four - momentum transfer between the incoming and outgoing protons , @xmath4 is the momentum fraction carried off by the pomeron , a moveable detector system , approaching the beam as closely as possible , is needed .",
    "hence the use of pp2pp roman pots ( rps ) is advantageous not only because it is a working system but because it will also allow maximizing the t and @xmath3 ranges .",
    "we describe a scenario of executing the physics program in two phases , which optimizes the use of available resources and maximizes physics output .",
    "phase i has been implemented and is ready to take data in 2008 . in the future",
    "the physics reach will be extended to higher values of @xmath2 and larger data samples will be taken .",
    "this would be achieved in phase ii , for which design work is needed .",
    "in this section we shall briefly describe physics topics in proton - proton collisions , which can be addressed by using the roman pots of the pp2pp experiment and the star detector .",
    "a more detailed description of the physics can be found in  @xcite . at rhic",
    "the processes of interest in polarized proton - proton and proton nucleus collisions are  @xcite : elastic scattering , central production and single diffraction processes . here",
    "we shall focus on the first two , fig .",
    "[ diffproc ] .",
    "the common feature of those reactions is that the proton undergoes quasi - elastic or elastic scattering and that they occur via the exchange of colorless objects with the quantum numbers of the vacuum , historically called pomeron exchange . in terms of qcd ,",
    "pomeron exchange consists of the exchange of a color singlet combination of gluons .",
    "hence , triggering on forward protons at high ( rhic ) energies dominantly selects exchanges mediated by gluonic matter .",
    "in addition , the use of polarized proton beams , unique at rhic , will allow exploring unknown spin dependence of diffraction .",
    "tagging and measuring forward protons also removes the ambiguity of a ( complementary ) rapidity gap tag , which has a background due to the low multiplicity of diffractive events , and allows the full characterization of the event in terms of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 .      in studies of the elastic scattering process",
    "we will use unique capabilities of rhic colliding polarized proton beams to measure both spin dependent and spin averaged observables .",
    "almost the entire energy range of this proposal has been inaccessible to proton - proton scattering in the past .",
    "a measurement of the total cross section , @xmath6 at the highest possible energy will probe the prevalent assumption that the cross sections for @xmath7 and @xmath8 scattering are asymptotically identical .",
    "the measurement of the differential pp cross section @xmath9 over the extended @xmath2-range will include the region at the lower @xmath10 that is particularly sensitive to the @xmath11-parameter .",
    "this will allow extracting the @xmath11-parameter and the nuclear slope parameter @xmath12 in a combined fit to the differential cross section possible and might also lead to an extraction of @xmath6 .",
    "an asymptotic difference between the differential and total cross sections for @xmath7 and @xmath8 could be explained by a contribution of the odderon to the scattering amplitude .",
    "the absence of an odderon contribution would lead to identical cross sections , approaching each other roughly as @xmath13 .    by measuring spin related asymmetries",
    "one will be able to determine elastic scattering at the amplitude level  @xcite .",
    "the availability of longitudinal polarization at star in this first phase would allow measuring @xmath14 in addition to @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 resulting in a significant improvement of our physics capabilities .",
    "full azimuthal coverage for elastic events has been implemented in this phase .",
    "one of the physics motivations to measure the @xmath18 is to study of the @xmath19 dependence of the spin - flip to spin - nonflip amplitudes ratio  @xcite . in other words",
    "it may occur that small contribution from hadronic spin - flip to the spin single - spin asymmetry , measured with a polarized jet target at 100 gev / c , could increase at @xmath20 .",
    "this will help to reveal long standing problem of the energy dependence of the spin flip amplitude , which is best answered experimentally .      in the double pomeron exchange process",
    "each proton `` emits '' a pomeron and the two pomerons interact producing a massive system @xmath5 .",
    "the massive system could form resonances or jet pairs .",
    "because of the constraints provided by the double pomeron interaction , glueballs , and other states coupling preferentially to gluons , could be produced with much reduced backgrounds compared to standard hadronic production processes .    in the kinematical region , which we are proposing to cover ,",
    "those processes allow exploration of the non - perturbative regime of qcd .",
    "the strength of the star detector : excellent charged particle identification in the central rapidity region and @xmath21 resolution , coupled with ability to tag diffractive events with the forward protons with roman pots .",
    "central production using roman pots and rapidity gap techniques has been studied at all the hadron colliders : isr  @xcite , s@xmath8s  @xcite and the tevatron  @xcite and is planned to be studied at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the idea that the production of glueballs is enhanced in the central region in the process @xmath22p was first proposed by  @xcite and was demonstrated experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the crucial argument here is that the pattern of resonances produced in central region , where both forward protons are tagged , depends on the vector difference of the transverse momentum of the final state protons @xmath23 and @xmath24 , with @xmath25 .",
    "the so - called @xmath26 filter argument is that when @xmath26 is large ( @xmath27 ) @xmath28 states are prominent and when @xmath26 is small the surviving resonances include glueball candidates  @xcite .    in what we are proposing large data samples of diffractive states",
    "can be obtained and analyzed as function of diffractive mass @xmath5 and @xmath2 ( @xmath29 ) for central production .",
    "we will execute the above physics program in two phases . in both phases roman pots and star detector",
    "shall be used , fig .",
    "[ layout ] .",
    "the existing pp2pp experimental set - up , already installed at star , will measure spin dependence of both elastic scattering in an unexplored @xmath2 and @xmath3 range , with respect to what has been done already , and of central production described above , for which our studies found that there is good acceptance .      using the capacity of existing power supplies one can run with optics of @xmath30 and at @xmath20 .",
    "this optics could extend the @xmath2 coverage to @xmath31 .",
    "reaching such a small @xmath10-value allows measuring the single spin analyzing power @xmath18 close to its maximum at @xmath32 , where @xmath33 , at @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath18 and its @xmath2-dependence in the covered range is sensitive to a possible contribution of the single spin - flip amplitude , @xmath34  @xcite , from the interference between the hadronic spin - flip amplitude with the electromagnetic non - flip amplitude .",
    "an additional contribution of the hypothetical odderon to the pp scattering amplitude can be probed by measuring the double spin - flip asymmetry , @xmath15  @xcite .",
    "given polarization 50@xmath35 and 2.3 mb cross section within our acceptance we shall get @xmath36 events . in the four @xmath2 subintervals we shall have @xmath37 events in each .",
    "the corresponding errors are @xmath38 . to estimate the error on @xmath15 the @xmath39 intervals @xmath40 and @xmath41 were used , and complementary intervals for @xmath16 .    for the amount of data we expect to collect in 2008 , an estimated error on the slope parameter is @xmath42 and on the ratio of real to imaginary part @xmath43 , which is comparable to the existing measurements from the @xmath7 and @xmath44 data .",
    "we studied the geometrical acceptance of our setup for both sdd and dpe processes .",
    "we have generated protons with @xmath2 and @xmath3 uniformly distributed in the regions @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "we assumed that the roman pots are 10 mm from the beam center , which is at least @xmath47 of the beam size at the detection point .",
    "our studies indicate that there is good acceptance to measure inelastic diffraction processes dpe with @xmath48 optics for phase i. with the expected luminosity we can collect about @xmath49 , triggered dpe events .",
    "number of events for which the proton momentum is reconstructed , where it is required that two rps on each side are used allowing reconstruction of the outgoing proton momentum , is about factor of ten lower .",
    "one assumes a 10 @xmath50barn cross section within our acceptance for the dpe process .",
    "also , as noted earlier the events seen in the star time projection chamber ( tpc ) in pp central production are very similar to those in heavy - ion upc collisions .",
    "the algorithms and reconstruction code that has been developed to deal with those events can also be used in our program .",
    "in particular experience gained in dealing with the backgrounds is very valuable .      to maximize the acceptance and the range in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath5 in this phase the roman pot system needs to be installed between dx - d0 magnets and",
    "will be used in conjunction with the star tpc to reconstruct and fully constrain events with resonance in central production process .",
    "a study needs to be done that range .",
    "the search for exotics is one of the topics of interest here , but not the only one .",
    "in summary the physics program with tagged forward protons at star will : 1 ) study elastic scattering and its spin dependence in unexplored @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath19 range ; 2)study the structure of color singlet exchange in the non - perturbative regime of qcd ; 3 ) search for diffractive production of light and massive systems in double pomeron exchange process ; 4 ) search for new physics , including glueballs and odderon .",
    "finally we stress that the studies we are proposing will add to our understanding of qcd in the non - perturbative regime where calculations are not easy and one has to be guided by measurements .",
    "the research reported here has been performed in part under the us doe contract de - ac02 - 98ch10886 .",
