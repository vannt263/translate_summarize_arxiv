    "partial differential equations describing continuous models and real systems can be discretized into a system of coupled maps called as coupled map lattices ( cml ) . in the last fifteen years",

    ", just a few rigorous analytical results on the chaotic dynamics observed in cml have been achieved , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "chaotic behavior in extended systems is typically incoherent , @xcite .",
    "the problem of stability in lattice dynamical systems has been extensively discussed in @xcite .",
    "the long - time limit along orbit of the rate of separation of points in the tangent motion is given by the liapunov exponents spectrum @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the jacobian matrix evaluated on the orbit @xmath2 .",
    "the notation @xmath3 denotes the @xmath4-th eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath5 ordered in such a way that @xmath6 the spectrum ( [ le ] ) characterizes the stability of motion in the phase space .",
    "if all exponents @xmath7 are negative the trajectory has an attractive fixed point . if the maximal value of the spectrum @xmath8 , the attractor is a limit cycle , whereas positive exponents correspond to diverging orbits .",
    "a simple example of cml is given by the 1-dimensional chain @xmath9 , \\quad x\\in { \\mathbb z } , \\quad t\\in { \\mathbb z_+ } , \\label{nnc}\\ ] ] of loosely coupled ( @xmath10 ) piecewise linear maps @xmath11 which is known to induce the chaotic behavior as the value of the control parameter becomes @xmath12 .",
    "space - time chaos properties in chains of weakly interacting hyperbolic maps has been considered in @xcite .",
    "the liapunov exponent of the solitary uncoupled map ( [ map ] ) is known exactly as a function of the control parameter @xmath13 @xmath14 furthermore , since the correspondent jacobian in ( [ nnc ] ) is a @xmath15 tridiagonal matrix , its eigenvalues can be computed explicitly for any finite number of sites @xmath16 provided the boundary conditions ( @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) are known , @xcite . for example , chosen the zero valued boundary conditions , @xmath19 one obtains the following liapunov exponents spectrum , @xmath20 for any finite @xmath16 , the spectrum ( [ lk ] ) is bounded from above by the maximal value coinciding with the liapunov exponent of uncoupled maps @xmath21 .",
    "either of the spectral values @xmath22 depend both on the boundary conditions chosen and the actual value of the coupling strength parameter @xmath23 in the extended limit , @xmath24 the boundary conditions can be assumed as an asymptote @xmath25 and the spectrum ( [ lk ] ) turns to a band . in actual numerical simulations of the extended limit ,",
    "the boundary conditions are usually taken as periodic .",
    "more realistic models for partial differential equations refer to more complicated coupled maps lattices for which the liapunov exponents spectra have not been found .",
    "therefore , one is interested in methods which can yield at least qualitative information on them .",
    "the liapunov exponents spectra of cml in the extended limit , @xmath26 is of special interest , @xcite .",
    "intuitively , if the system is large enough , subsystems that are sufficiently separated in space become decorrelated and so contribute to the fractal dimension in proportion to their number .",
    "this phenomenon usually called as an _ extensive _ chaos , @xcite , is numerically observed for lattice sizes larger than some threshold value depending on the model , @xcite .    for large lattices ,",
    "the number of positive liapunov exponents @xmath27 scales like the lattice size @xmath28 where @xmath16 is the volume of a large albeit finite piece @xmath29 of the lattice , and @xmath30 is said to be the volume of a typical statistically independent block . in accordance with numerical simulations data , @xmath30 depends substantially on the particular model while the relation ( [ scale ] ) is believed to hold generally . the result ( [ scale ] ) has been observed numerically for some simple coupled map lattices ( see @xcite and references therein for a review ) .",
    "nevertheless , up to our knowledge , the scaling ( [ scale ] ) has not been justified analytically , in particular , the meaning of the statistically independent block @xmath30 is still vague .",
    "another fascinating phenomenon observed in the chaotic coupled map lattices @xcite-@xcite is a non - trivial collective behavior ( `` hidden coherence '' , @xcite ) , where there is apparently a unique nice invariant measure , @xcite , but nevertheless non - uniqueness of nice measures on the space - time configurations , because a two - cycle or more complicated dynamic behavior occurs in time .",
    "the time periodic behavior of measures has been discussed in @xcite ( `` asymptotic periodicity '' ) .",
    "the chaotic dynamics in cml lacks of mathematically rigorous results .",
    "nevertheless , some `` physical '' approaches borrowed from statistical physics and quantum mechanics can be applied to the theory of chaotic spatially extended dynamical systems .",
    "an essential problem of the `` physical '' point of view is that one implies the nice invariant measure ( or nice measures if the system is subjected to a phase transition ) is defined . in general ,",
    "coupled maps are not the case except the coupling parameter @xmath31 is not vanishingly small , @xcite .",
    "our example of coupled maps chain ( [ nnc ] ) has an invariant measure defined as a gibbs state even if @xmath31 is not small , @xcite .",
    "the non - trivial collective behavior ( `` hidden coherence '' ) is not actually captured by the present paper . at the same time , while computing the generalized entropy @xmath32 and the partition function @xmath33 , we shall perform the summations @xmath34 over `` all configurations '' @xmath35 .",
    "the summation technique that we use relies upon the symmetry properties of the coupled chaotic maps chain and is known as a _ collective coordinates _ method . proceeding with computations ,",
    "we replace @xmath34 with an integration over an infinite set of continuous real valued positive variables .",
    "this stroke also implies that there is a number of nice measures on the space - time configurations .",
    "the _ scaling _ hypothesis in thermodynamics has been an important milestone in formulation of the modern phase transitions theory .",
    "it is based on two fundamental principles of non - equilibrium thermodynamics :    \\i ) while interesting in critical phenomena , one can substitute a true micro - model for a _ fluctuation _",
    "one ;    \\ii ) in the regime of strongly developed fluctuations , the initial values are of no consequences for the system behavior .    for the ising model , the scaling hypothesis put forward by kadanoff @xcite leans upon the `` blocks '' procedure , in which the interactions of spins have been replaced for the interactions of `` spin blocks '' .",
    "it consists of two propositions :    \\j ) the hamiltonian of `` spin blocks '' interaction has just the same form as the hamiltonian of spin interaction with parameters changed ;    jj ) the dependence of parameters on the block size @xmath36 has a scaling form as @xmath37    for the uncoupled maps having a `` short range time memory '' , the scaling hypothesis has been propounded first in @xcite , @xcite and then used in @xcite .",
    "we will follow a track by considering fluctuating effective quantities analogous to the liapunov exponents in finite time segments , @xmath38 the `` effective liapunov exponent '' @xmath39 define the rate of separation of points in tangent motion in finite time .",
    "they fluctuates around the true liapunov exponent @xmath40 having the fluctuation range @xmath41 , @xcite : @xmath42 in which @xmath43 is the probability distribution to observe fluctuation @xmath41 in @xmath44 time steps . in the limit @xmath45 , @xmath39 form a micro - canonical ensemble @xmath46    an example of @xmath43 , one can consider the fig.1 where we have plotted the data of @xmath47 numerical simulations for the uncoupled solitary map ( [ map ] ) at @xmath48 for the effective liapunov exponent @xmath49 @xmath50 the graph shows the probability distribution to observe deviations from the true liapunov exponent @xmath51 when @xmath44 growths up , the bell - shaped profile becomes sharper .",
    "being a product of @xmath44 jacobi matrices , the effective rates @xmath49 for the maps with a short - range time memory , behave like averages of @xmath44 random variables correlated only over short time .",
    "therefore , their values , for @xmath44 large , do not depend on the particular choice of initial conditions .    the scaling hypothesis formulated in @xcite for such maps claims on the _ self - similarity _ property for the microscopical entropy , @xmath52 in a long however finite time string , @xmath53 , in the chaotic regime : @xmath54,\\quad s = ng(\\lambda)\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a `` scaling function '' ( a `` free energy '' ) pertinent to the map , @xcite .    in the fig.2 ,",
    "we have pictured out the ratio of scaling functions @xmath56 via @xmath57 computed numerically for the map ( [ map ] ) in the sequences of @xmath58 and @xmath59 time steps .",
    "the picture data show that there is an interval of deviations @xmath60)$ ] within which the scaling function @xmath55 is almost _ universal _ at least in the first @xmath61 time steps .",
    "we note that in accordance with ( [ sh ] ) , given a smooth function @xmath62 the relevant observable is @xmath63 since @xmath44 is a large number , one infers that the main contribution to this integral comes from the saddle - point configuration @xmath64 such that @xmath65 is the maximal @xmath66 .",
    "indeed , this hypothesis breaks down for maps with strong long - time correlations , when a minor change of initial conditions can stir the behavior even in a very long time segments .    in the present paper",
    ", we extend the scaling hypothesis to the case of coupled maps lattices .",
    "we search for the statistics of fluctuating quantities @xmath67 analogous to the true liapunov exponents @xmath7 in a long albeit finite time .",
    "we consider the extended lattices ( @xmath68 ) of coupled maps with a short range time memory . by the way , the boundary conditions are of no consequences for the system behavior in `` thermodynamic limit '' .    therefore , following @xcite and resting on the numerical simulations data cited in @xcite , we propose that in the chaotic regime the `` free energy '' function @xmath69 pertinent to the cml is universal up to the statistically independent block @xmath70 so that the probability to observe a deviation of range @xmath71 in the thermodynamic limit equals to @xmath72,\\quad s = nn_\\mathcal{u}g_\\mathcal{u}(\\lambda).\\ ] ] furthermore , we propose that in the chaotic regime the scaling function pertinent to the coupled maps lattice , @xmath73 up to a change of parameters equals to that one for the solitary uncoupled map , @xmath74    in thermodynamic limit , according to ( [ sh1 ] ) , the most important contribution to observables comes from saddle - points configurations @xmath75 ( provided they exist ) maximizing the scaling function @xmath76      let us remark on a semblance between the statistics of effective liapunov exponents of the simplest loosely coupled ( @xmath77 ) maps chain ( [ nnc ] ) in thermodynamic limit and of the quantum mechanical system with a double - well potential in the infinite @xmath78 limit ( i.e. , in small temperature limit , @xmath79 ) @xcite .    for @xmath80 ,",
    "the main contribution to the partition function of the quantum mechanical problem comes from the _ instanton _ ( or saddle - points ) configurations which renders the action stationary . in the limit @xmath81 a linear combination of instanton solutions",
    "plays a role .",
    "the relevant contributions do not correspond to solutions of the classical equations of motion since these equations are non - linear .",
    "however , in the limit when all instantons are largely separated , such a combination also renders the action almost stationary since the relevant corrections coming from each instanton are exponentially small in the separation .",
    "to properly study the energy spectrum of the quantum mechanical problem at @xmath79 , first , one has to introduce a set of collective variables ( or coordinates ) which describe fluctuations in distances between the instantons , and , second , to fix out their values in such a way that minimizes the variation of the action .    in the present paper",
    ", we are going to apply this method to compute the asymptotic of a partition function @xmath33 over the space of possible configurations @xmath82 generated by the chain of coupled maps ( [ nnc ] ) .    in fig .",
    "3.1 , we have plotted the results of @xmath83 numerical simulations for the chain of @xmath84 coupled maps ( the value of coupling strength parameter has been taken as @xmath85 ) supplied by the zero valued boundary conditions .",
    "this graph shows the probability distribution profile to observe the effective liapunov exponents @xmath39 in the interval @xmath86 $ ] in @xmath87 iterations .",
    "one can see that almost all values @xmath39 drop around the true liapunov exponents laying within this interval , @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the quota of @xmath39 arising apart from the close vicinities of liapunov exponents @xmath91 decreases very fast as @xmath92 grows up .    in fig .",
    "3.2 , we have drawn the distribution profile at @xmath93 time steps .",
    "for @xmath94 the dispersion @xmath95 becomes much smaller than the distances @xmath96 between peaks , @xmath97 this means that fluctuations which tend to change distances between liapunov exponents induce just a vanishingly small variation of @xmath66 at long time segments .",
    "we note that the thermodynamic limit when fluctuations of @xmath67 are faded out , plays the role of the infinite separation limit for instantons in the quantum well problem mentioned above .",
    "the plan of the paper follows . in the sec .",
    "2 , leaning on the thermodynamic formalism as applied to cml , we explain what kind of information on the liapunov exponents spectrum one could obtain from the relevant partition function @xmath98 then , in sec . 3 and 4 , we compute @xmath33 using the scaling hypothesis formulated in the previous subsection ( 1.2 ) and following methods developed in quantum mechanics with respect to the double - well potential problem @xcite .",
