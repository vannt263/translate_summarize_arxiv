    "if the set @xmath28 satisfies some geometric conditions and if @xmath26 is a restriction to @xmath28 of a solution of ( [ eq : wave ] ) , then the problem is well - posed in the sense that the state @xmath20 corresponding to the pair @xmath32 is unique .    in view of the unavoidable uncertainties on the data @xmath26 ( coming from measurements , numerical approximations , etc ) , the problem needs to be relaxed . in this respect ,",
    "the most natural ( and widely used in practice ) approach consists to introduce the following extremal problem ( of least - squares type ) @xmath33 since @xmath20 is uniquely and fully determined from @xmath34 and the data @xmath35 . here",
    "the constraint @xmath36 in @xmath27 is relaxed ; however , if @xmath26 is a restriction to @xmath28 of a solution of ( [ eq : wave ] ) , then problems and obviously coincide . a minimizing sequence for @xmath37 in @xmath38 is easily defined in term of the solution of an auxiliary adjoint problem .",
    "apart from a possible low decrease of the sequence near extrema , the main drawback , when one wants to prove the convergence of a discrete approximation is that , it is in general not possible to minimize over a discrete subspace of @xmath39 subject to the equality ( in @xmath40 ) @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , the minimization procedure first requires the discretization of the functional @xmath37 and of the system ( [ eq : wave ] ) ; this raised the issue of uniform coercivity property ( typically here some uniform discrete observability inequality for the adjoint solution ) of the discrete functional with respect to the approximation parameter .",
    "as far as we know , this delicate issue has received answers only for specific and somehow academic situations ( uniform cartesian approximation of @xmath1 , constant coefficients in ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "more recently , a different method to solve inverse type problems like has emerged and use so called luenberger type observers : this consists in defining , from the observation on @xmath28 , an auxiliary boundary value problem whose solution possesses the same asymptotic behavior in time than the solution of ( [ eq : wave ] ) : the use of the reversibility of the hyperbolic equation then allows to reconstruct the initial data @xmath35 .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein .",
    "but , for the same reasons , on a numerically point of view , these method require to prove uniform discrete observability properties .",
    "in a series of works , klibanov and co - workers use different approaches to solve inverse problems ( we refer to @xcite and the references therein ) : they advocate in particular the quasi - reversibility method which reads as follows : for any @xmath42 , find @xmath43 the solution of @xmath44 for all @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes a hilbert space subset of @xmath47 so that @xmath48 for all @xmath49 and @xmath42 a tikhonov like parameter which ensures the well - posedness .",

    "there , unlike in problem , the unknown is the state variable @xmath20 itself ( as it is natural for elliptic equations ) so that any standard numerical methods based on a conformal approximation of the space @xmath46 together with appropriate observability inequalities allow to obtain a convergent approximation of the solution . in particular",
    ", there is no need to prove discrete observability inequalities .",
    "we refer to the book @xcite .",

    ", we explore the direct resolution of the optimality conditions associated to the extremal problem , without tikhonov parameter while keeping @xmath20 as the unknown of the problem .",
    "this strategy , which avoids any iterative process , has been successfully applied in the closed context of the exact controllability of ( [ eq : wave ] ) in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "interestingly , in section [ sec2_dual ] , we also derive a equivalent dual extremal problem , which reduces the determination of the state @xmath20 to the minimization of an elliptic functional with respect to the lagrange multiplier . in section [ recovering_y_f ]",
