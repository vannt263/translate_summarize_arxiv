    "the magnetic penetration depth @xmath7 figures prominently in many aspects of superconductivity .",
    "it is the length scale over which an external magnetic field is screened by a superconductor in the meissner state , it sets the size of vortices in the mixed state , and it is a controlling factor in many other properties such as microwave and far infrared absorption .",
    "the fundamental importance of the penetration depth is that it provides a rather direct measure of the superfluid phase stiffness @xmath21 , or what is often referred to as superfluid density @xmath22 , which can be a tensor quantity due to effects such as an anisotropic effective mass @xmath23 . in the cuprates ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath7 on temperature @xmath24 and hole - doping have provided major pieces of the cuprate puzzle .",
    "microwave measurements of @xmath25 at low @xmath24 revealed a linear dependence providing some of the first key evidence of the presence of line nodes in the superconducting gap in the cuprates@xcite and the temperature dependence of @xmath26 near @xmath27 suggested that the transition is governed by 3dxy critical fluctuations.@xcite evidence that the low temperature value of the phase stiffness @xmath28 depends linearly on @xmath27 , has been obtained from muon spin relaxation measurements of @xmath26.@xcite    accurate and precise measurements of the absolute value of @xmath29 are particularly important for understanding superconductivity in the cuprates , and are critical for broad studies of doping dependence .",
    "having an absolute value of @xmath7 is also crucial in the interpretation of other experiments that involve superfluid screening , with examples including the microwave conductivity , the lower critical field @xmath30 , and the conversion of measurements of @xmath25 to the temperature dependent superfluid density @xmath31 .",
    "however , the absolute value of @xmath7 has proven to be particularly difficult to measure .",
    "a wide variety of techniques exist for doing so , but each has important drawbacks that must be acknowledged .",
    "one class of techniques takes place in the mixed state , probing the length scale over which fields decay away from a magnetic vortex.@xcite muon spin relaxation ( @xmath32 ) falls into this class and suffers from the difficulty that the screening length scale obtained from a mixed state measurement in relatively high fields can differ from the penetration depth in the meissner state because of non - linear and non - local effects.@xcite vortex state measurements are also unable to directly resolve the anisotropy in @xmath7 in orthorhombic materials because the screening currents circulate around a vortex . a second class of techniques measures magnetic flux exclusion from a sample in the meissner state , essentially by measuring the magnetic susceptibility at dc , radio or microwave frequencies.@xcite these",
    "can precisely determine the temperature dependence @xmath33 relative to a base temperature @xmath34 .",
    "however , a measurement of the absolute value amounts to a comparison between the physical volume of the sample and a susceptibility determination of the volume that is field - free , the difference being the small volume at the surface that is penetrated by the field .",
    "such a measurement is most sensitive if the ratio of surface area to volume is large , which can be achieved by working with powders .",
    "however , difficulties in aligning powders and modelling the shape and size distribution of grains introduce substantial uncertainties in the absolute value of @xmath7.@xcite for a macroscopic , high quality crystal of a cuprate superconductor , it is nearly impossible to measure sample dimensions precisely enough to achieve an absolute measurement of @xmath7 this way , except in geometries dominated by the very large values of @xmath7 for screening currents running in the @xmath35-direction .    a very direct measurement of the penetration depth has been achieved by measuring the transmission of low frequency fields through very thin films using mutual inductance techniques .",
    "while this is a very sensitive method , its chief drawbacks are the need to work with films and the difficulty of measuring anisotropy.@xcite techniques that can resolve the anisotropy include far infrared and optical measurements that determine the inductive response of the superfluid at high frequencies.@xcite such measurements are difficult because of their need for spectra over a very wide frequency range in order to perform kramers - krnig transforms and are also susceptible to error because the measured response can also include screening by uncondensed carriers in addition to the superfluid .",
    "however , this approach can be used to determine the anisotropy of @xmath7 simply by polarizing the light and measuring optical properties along all of the principal axes .",
    "such infrared determinations of the absolute value of @xmath7 at low temperature have been combined with microwave measurements of @xmath25 to produce the anisotropic @xmath36 in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath13 at y=0.60 and 0.95,@xcite but it would be far preferable to have a more direct microwave measurement that gives the absolute value of @xmath7 , measured _ on the same sample _ as that used to determine the temperature dependence .",
    "this paper describes a microwave technique that directly measures the small volume near the surface that is field - penetrated in the meissner state , rather than inferring @xmath7 from a measurement of the very large volume that is field - free ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fields ] ) .",
    "we use this technique here to measure the absolute value of @xmath7 for all three principal axes in yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath13 .",
    "the key to the method is to embed a randomly distributed low concentration of magnetic moments in the superconductor in such a way that they will act as local field probes and yet will minimally affect the transport properties .",
    "the magnetic moments will serve as a non - interacting spin system whose electron spin resonance ( esr ) spectrum is a sum of one - particle esr transitions .",
    "the energy levels of a single spin are determined by its crystallographic environment , _",
    "i.e. _ the charge distribution around the magnetic ion , and the resulting susceptibility is that of a single spin multiplied by the number of spins that participate in the esr process .",
    "if the moments are evenly distributed in the sample , the number of spins that participate in the process is proportional to the fraction of the sample s volume that is exposed to the field , _ i.e. _ the volume within a penetration depth of the surface . in order to count",
    "the number of spins exposed , we measure the zero field esr absorption spectrum with a microwave frequency magnetic field applied perpendicular to the principal spin axis acting as a small perturbation .    in the next section of this paper",
    "we describe the samples , the broadband microwave apparatus and the measurements of the apparent microwave surface resistance that ultimately yield values of the penetration depth .",
    "the third section describes how the theoretical esr spectrum was calculated using an effective crystal field hamiltonian , which is a necessary prerequisite for extracting @xmath7 . in the fourth section",
    "we examine the issue of oxygen ordering in the cuo chains of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath13 and comment upon the sensitivity of our measurements to this ordering . finally , we summarize our results and present new values for @xmath7 in all three directions , for three different dopings in the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath13 system .",
    "these results indicate a substantial departure from @xmath20 , the so - called uemura scaling .",

    "it is well - known that impurity doping can have a strong influence on the low energy density of states in a @xmath44-wave superconductor,@xcite and for the present work care must be taken to ensure that the introduction of the spin - probe impurity does not alter @xmath45 .",
    "this constrains the gd concentration x , but conversely we wish to maximize the amplitude of the esr response , which scales as x. we have found a good compromise at a nominal value of x@xmath4 which results in an easily resolved esr spectrum and does not significantly alter the intrinsic low temperature properties of the material .    in gd@xmath11y@xmath12ba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath13 , the dopant gd@xmath6 ion substitutes for the y@xmath6 ion which is sandwiched between the two cuo@xmath0 planes in the yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath13 unit cell that support the bulk of the electronic transport .",
    "the energy cost for cross - substitution of the gd on the ba site is prohibitive and such cation substitution occurs only for the lighter and larger members of the rare earth series .",
    "the esr spectrum is determined completely by the crystal field environment of the gd@xmath6 ion and therefore knowing that there is only one site for substitution means that changes in the esr spectrum from sample - to - sample can only be due to changes of the oxygen order in the cuo chains .",
    "another important feature of substitution on the y site is that the gd impurities are expected to be weak ( born ) limit quasiparticle scattering centers as was found to be the case for ca@xmath46 substitution on the same site.@xcite born scatterers have little effect on the superfluid density in the low temperature limit .",
    "this is in contrast , for instance , to the case of the non - magnetic impurity zn@xmath46 which substitutes _ into _ the cuo@xmath0 plane , and is known to be strongly pair - breaking .",

    "the annealing parameters have been previously published for the slightly overdoped ( nearly full cuo chains , y=0.993)@xcite and ortho - ii ordered ( alternating full and empty chains , y=0.52)@xcite crystals .",
    "other ordered phases at intermediate doping can also be produced with larger chain - ordered superlattices , namely ortho - iii@xcite and ortho - viii.@xcite crystals at these doping levels were produced using procedures very similar to that used to produce the ortho - ii samples , however the initial temperatures for setting the oxygen content were different ( 668 @xmath47c for ortho - viii and 609 @xmath47c for ortho - iii ) as were the final low temperature annealing temperatures used to establish oxygen ordering in the cuo chain layers ( 35 @xmath47c for ortho - viii ( y=0.67 ) order and 60 @xmath47c for ortho - iii ( y=0.77 ) order ) .    a critical parameter in our data analysis is the absolute concentration of gd ions x , which was measured using electron - probe micro - analysis ( epma ) .",

    "[ fig : doping ] .",
    "note that the esr points consistently underestimate the amount of oxygen in the crystals .",
    "this is likely due to the inefficiency of isolated oxygens in empty chains in promoting a hole into the cuo@xmath0 planes .",
    "the above oxygen content analysis assumes maximal length of chains , _",
    "i.e. _ all chains are either full or missing with no isolated oxygens or vacancies .",
    "since the gd ions are likely to be sensing the presence of chains through their influence on the charge distribution on the much nearer cuo@xmath0 planes , an isolated oxygen ion hardly affects the crystal field environment since it does not promote a hole into the planes.@xcite thus a gd ion near an isolated oxygen in an otherwise empty chain will experience the crystal field of an empty chain .",
    "this will lead to an underestimate of the oxygen content , but will not affect the overall counting of gd ions .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the esr analysis provides a good measure of the chain disorder .",
    "for example , perfect three dimensional ortho - ii ordering should produce only one band , corresponding to two full chains , the d - band .",
    "however , our ortho - ii spectrum displays two additional bands ( the b- and f- bands ) resulting from imperfections in the ortho - ii ordering.@xcite these deviations can be interpreted as ortho - ii phase boundaries .",

    "the optimally doped sample , with the maximum attainable @xmath27 of 93  k ( y=0.93 ) is also in the ortho - i phase , but has a substantial number of oxygen vacancies on the chains .",
    "the esr spectrum at each doping was fitted with a spectrum generated by an effective cf hamiltonian , with initial guesses for the cf parameters taken from rockenbauer _",
    "et al._@xcite subsequently , the cf parameters were adjusted to best describe our measured spectra , and the best fit values are presented in table  [ table : cf ] . the evolution of the dominant cf parameter ( @xmath159 ) as a function of the esr measured oxygen content is shown in fig .  [ fig : cfb02 ] .",
    "the values and systematic trends of our fit values compare well to those of the conventional esr studies on powders.@xcite    the esr spectrum is a sensitive probe of the crystallographic structure and the crystal symmetry in particular .",
    "this high sensitivity is demonstrated at its best in the spectrum of our overdoped sample .",
    "this is the most ordered and most orthorhombic phase , with four full cuo chains around virtually every gd ion .",
    "the lines are very sharp and the main band , g , corresponds to 96% of the total spectral weight . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : oi ] , the orthorhombicity of the crystal is manifested as an additional line in the spectrum that appears only when the measurement is performed with screening currents flowing along the @xmath9-direction .",
    "the spectra for both directions can be fit with a single set of cf parameters by introducing an orthorhombic term in the cf hamiltonian .",
    "this term is @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is the measured coefficient and @xmath162 .",
    "the inclusion of this term allows the otherwise forbidden transitions of @xmath143 only when the magnetic field is applied in the @xmath163-direction , and reveals the slight orthorhombicity of the crystal ( the difference between the @xmath8 and @xmath9-dimensions of the unit cell is less than 2% ) .",
    "the measured ortho - iii spectrum is indicative of some disorder in the chain structure .",
    "first , the substantial amount of spectral weight in the f - band , which corresponds to three full chains , indicates that even if the ordering is perfect in the planes , the stacking along the @xmath164-direction is disordered , _",
    "i.e. _ that the ortho - iii structure may shift between adjacent chain layers . second , we find that each esr peak is composed of two closely spaced lines that together produce a non - lorentzian shape . since the measured esr oxygen level is consistent with the other crystals ( see y@xmath165 in fig .",
    "[ fig : doping ] ) , we are confident in the band identification and do not interpret the minor splitting as a change of chain configuration",
    ". the splitting implies a small variation of cf parameters _ within the same band_. this might be the result of inhomogeneity in the oxygen concentration , which is consistent with a measured transition temperature broadening @xmath166t@xmath1671  k. however , we do not think that the sample is macroscopically phase separated since the line shapes were not affected by cleaving the sample into smaller pieces .",
    "our ortho - ii spectra suggest fairly good ordering within the chain layers with a somewhat shorter correlation length in the @xmath164-direction .",
    "this is in agreement with x - ray analysis.@xcite the extraction of @xmath39 in this sample was done by comparing two measurements in the @xmath8-direction , where the first measurement was done on the whole sample and the second one on two pieces resulting from a cleave along the @xmath9-direction .",
    "the effective penetration depth , @xmath95 was observed to increase by about 210  nm due to the introduction of two more sample @xmath168-faces , where currents flow along the @xmath164-direction .",
    "we have obtained enough data in order to reliably extract the absolute values of the penetration depth in all three crystallographic directions for three of the five doping levels studied : fully doped , ortho - ii and ortho - iii .",
    "our measurements at the remaining two doping levels were made using samples that were not amenable to the cleaving procedure required to extract absolute values of @xmath7 .",
    "our final results for @xmath7 were derived as described in the previous sections with the emphasis on performing enough measurements on the same sample in order to eliminate sample - dependent effects and to overdetermine the values of @xmath7 for error control .",
    "the penetration depth results are presented in table  [ table : lambda ] .",
    "the error estimates account for uncertainties arising from measurements of the sample dimensions , calibration of the microwave absorption experiment@xcite and the estimation of the esr fit parameters . since the extraction of the penetration depth in the three crystallographic directions depends sensitively on the sample s dimensions , it is important to work with crystals that have smooth parallel well defined faces whose area is easy to measure .",
    "this was most easily achieved by choosing a single sample having a nice platelet geometry for each doping .",
    "if we restrict our analysis to measurements made on the same crystal where the geometry of the sample can be altered in a controlled fashion by cleaving , we obtain a high degree of internal consistency between different measurements . in all cases we performed an extra measurement that overdetermines the penetration depth values and found agreement ranging from 0.5% to 6% . in the case of the ortho - ii doping we measured a second sample having a 30% higher gd concentration , and the results agreed to within 12% of the first sample .",

    "the orthorhombicity of the crystal lattice is apparent in the appearance of an additional esr line at 6.9  ghz when the screening currents flow in the @xmath9-direction .",

    "this same line appears with suppressed intensity in the @xmath8-direction due to a small fraction of twinning in the sample .",

    "we have shown that our crystal field parameters agree very well with those obtained by previous authors using the completely different method of high field esr on powdered samples .",
    "our results also support the conclusions of the same work which found that isolated oxygens in vacant chains do not influence the cf configuration around the magnetic ion and therefore can not be distinguished from a vacant chain via esr spectroscopy .",
    "this is in accord with the fact that isolated oxygens do not promote holes from the copper - oxygen planes.@xcite    the principal result of this work is a set of new values for the penetration depth in all three crystallographic directions for three oxygen - ordered phases of yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath148 which are summarized in table ii .",
