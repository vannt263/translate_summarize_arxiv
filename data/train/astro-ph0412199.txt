    "since being introduced 10 years ago as a subset of the `` compact double '' class of objects @xcite , compact symmetric objects ( csos ; * ? ? ?",

    ", they derive ages from 10@xmath4 to 10@xmath5 yr . the random orientations of csos test the unified schemes of agn that require an obscuring torus of gas and dust surrounding the central engine . the angle that the line - of - sight of the observer makes with this torus determines what features",
    "are seen @xcite .",
    "csos often exhibit very broad hi absorption lines @xcite , and free - free absorption @xcite , providing evidence for the existence of this circumnuclear torus .",
    "csos also typically exhibit very low polarization , if any , due to the large faraday rotation measures induced by ionized gas associated with the torus .",
    "the ages of these objects can be measured by hot spot advance speeds .",
    "that is , the speeds of the outward moving hot spots are measured and the motions interpolated back to the center of the cso , assuming a constant source expansion rate .",
    "these age estimates are in agreement with , but more precise than , spectral aging arguments @xcite .",
    "kinematic age estimates carried out by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite are between 350 and 2000 years due to speeds of approximately 0.1  c. jet components , however , exhibit relativistic speeds @xcite as they feed the hot spots .    in this paper",

    "of the 21 sources listed in table 1 , 10 have been confirmed as csos by @xcite .",
    "the remaining 11 candidates have been carefully examined , and 4 are rejected because they are core - jet sources , while 5 are confirmed as csos based on the evidence presented in this paper ( j0000@xmath04054 , j0620@xmath02102 , j1111@xmath01955 , j1143@xmath01834 , and j2203@xmath01007 ) , and 2 sources remain candidates pending further observations .",

    "such large surveys are used for candidate selection because csos are rare ( @xmath105@xmath11 of compact objects ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is also necessary to go to moderate flux density levels ( @xmath10100  mjy at 5  ghz ) in order to form a complete sample .",
    "the jet axis in each of these objects usually lies within 60  of the plane of the sky , and the hot spot motions are moderately slow ( 0.1 c ) so relativistic beaming does not play a major role .",
    "csos are chiefly identified by ( 1 )  their high degree of symmetry , ( 2 )  a compact , variable , flat spectrum core in the center of the object , and ( 3 )  proper motions that are consistent with a centrally located core @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out at 8.4  ghz on 28 december 1997 , 16 march 1998 , 25 march 2000 , and 2 december 2002 , using the vlba and one vla antenna .",
    "observations were also made of the 11 candidates at 15  ghz on 4 january 2001 using the vlba .",
    "approximately half of the sources were observed in 1997 and the other half in 1998 , and so these are both referred to as the first epoch at 8.4  ghz .",
    "the results from this first epoch were presented by @xcite and are used here for the analysis of proper motions , although the data from 1997 were recalibrated to achieve better sensitivity .",
    "unavailable antennas in each epoch at 8.4  ghz were north liberty in 1997 , los alamos in 1998 , and st . croix in 2002 .",
    "amplitude calibration was derived using measurements of the system temperatures and antenna gains .",

    "was determined by using the evpa s of 3c  279 listed in the vla monitoring program @xcite and checked with the polarization calibrator 1310@xmath0323 .",
    "no attempt has been made to correct the electric vector polarization angles for faraday rotation , which is often significant on the parsec scale for agn @xcite .",
    "for each source , the 15  ghz data was tapered to produce an image at comparable resolution to the full resolution 8.4  ghz image .",
    "the two images were then combined to generate a spectral index map .",
    "it is important to note that spectral index maps made from two datasets with substantially different ( @xmath12 ) coverages may suffer from significant systematic errors , especially in regions of extended emission .",
    "figure 1 displays total intensity images for all 17 of the cso and cso candidate sources discussed in this paper . in all cases ,",
    "the 2000.227 epoch is used because it is the most sensitive .",
    "see table 2 for a summary of the properties of the cso and candidate images , along with the current classification of each source . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss results confirming 5 sources as csos from our initial 11 candidates identified from the coins sample .",
    "two sources are still regarded as cso candidates .",
    "ideally , a compact , flat spectrum , variable core component situated between two steep spectrum components must be identified before sources can be confirmed as csos .",
    "for some csos with a jet axis very close to the plane of the sky , the core may be so weak as to be undetectable , yet a cso identification can still be secured if there are symmetric , edge - brightened , steep spectrum hot spots , extended lobes , or motions consistent with a central core .",
    "this was the case for all 5 of the new csos .",
    "on the basis of morphology and spectral index ( defined @xmath13 ) , we reject 4 candidates because they are core - jets .",
    "the maps of these sources are presented in fig .",
    "2 and their parameters are described in table 3 .    for each cso and candidate source , we provide in table 4 the flux density of each component at each of the three epochs .",
    "we also provide an estimate of the core fraction ( defined as the flux density measured in the core component divided by the total flux density measured in the vlbi image ( see table 2 ) . the spectral index between 8.4 and 15 ghz is also given , along with the linearly polarized flux observed in the most sensitive second epoch .",
    "relative proper motions ( see table 4 ) were difficult to detect in most of these sources because of the slow apparent movement of cso components .",
    "however , where large errors are present , upper limits can be estimated for the motions , and from those we can obtain interesting lower limits on the kinematic ages .",
    "where redshifts are available , distances can be given in parsecs and velocities in terms of c. where identifiable , the core is used as the reference for relative motions .",
    "if there is no identifiable core , the brightest hot spot is used as the reference component .",
    "uncertainties in the positions were derived from the signal - to - noise ratios for a given component and the synthesised beam .",
    "motions are only given if the component motion is well fitted by a weighted least squares fit where the slope of the line is the velocity .",
    "that is , a @xmath14 of 2 or below is acceptable for a three epoch fit . in cases where",
    "only one component of the velocity was a good fit , either @xmath15 or @xmath16 , only that velocity component is used .",
    "this is apparent from the position angle being either @xmath1790 , 0 , or 90 degrees . in most cases , this occurs when the source axis lies close to the @xmath15 or @xmath16 axis .",
    "table 5 lists component and total fluxes for j1415@xmath01320 , which has two extra epochs of data from @xcite .",
    "tables 6 and 7 provide summaries of the proper motions and ages of components in the csos and candidates . finally , table 8 lists the component modelfits for the core - jets sources .",
    "also known as 4c  40.52 , this source has a central , compact group of components and extended lobes to the north and south .",
    "it has been identified with a galaxy of magnitude 21.4 @xcite .",
    "it was given a tentative cso classification based on 1.6  ghz morphology by @xcite .",
    "although no core could be determined from the spectral index map , the morphology and proper motions of the components make its new cso classification quite clear .",
    "the hot spot separation speed ( motion of component a with respect to component c ) is @xmath10.144 mas yr@xmath7 which gives an age of @xmath18280 yr .",
    "the core may be obscured by an optically thick torus , leaving only the base of one of the jets visible ( components b1 and b2 ) .",
    "this cso also has detectable polarization in the southern hot spot ( component c ) at 8.4  ghz ( 0.9 mjy , or 9@xmath19 ; see fig .",
    "this is considered the first confirmed cso to show polarized intensity .",
    "this cso has a double - lobe morphology with a faint central component .",
    "this component , labeled b , is thought to be the core @xcite .",
    "the motion of hot spot a away from the core provides an upper limit for the hot spot advance speed ( @xmath10.014 mas yr@xmath7 ) , which gives a lower limit for the age of 340 yr .",
    "this agn is still considered a candidate cso because of its double - lobe structure . however , the core is not clearly identifiable either from the spectral index map or component variability ( see table 4 ) .",
    "component d1 appears to move with marginal significance to the west with respect to d2 , but otherwise no motions are detected .      with a bright central core",
    ", this cso has a jet extending in the eastern direction and a fainter counter - jet southwest of the core .",
    "it initially seems as though components a and b are moving slowly towards the core ( component c ) . however , it is possible that the core is ejecting components to the east and west , but the new eastern component is doppler boosted and makes the core appear to shift in the direction of the stronger jet .",
    "the motion of component d away from the core is 0.070@xmath200.011 mas yr@xmath7 , giving an age of 240@xmath2036 yr .      a very bright and compact object ,",
    "this cso was used to solve for the polarization leakage terms .",
    "the prominent and variable ( @xmath1014% ) core is easily identifiable as component b. component c displays a surprisingly large motion with respect to b in the expected direction . with a motion of 0.060@xmath200.013 mas yr@xmath7 , the estimated age of this component is only 20@xmath204 yr . if this is a hot spot , then this makes this the youngest cso known .",
    "alternatively , we could be measuring a fast jet component in which case the absence of detectable hot spots farther out is puzzling .",
    "this nearly equal double source has been identified here as a cso by the steep spectral indices of its hot spots ( @xmath211.0 ) and their lack of a significant hotspot separation velocity .",
    "this allows us to put an upper limit on the hot spot advance speed of @xmath10.013 mas yr @xmath7 , and a lower limit on the age of 2060 yr .",
    "this cso is dominated by two hot spots with a strong jet leading towards the northernmost lobe . with component",
    "c as the reference , we find an upper limit on the hot spot advance speeds of @xmath10.009 mas yr@xmath7 for component a , providing a lower limit to the age of 2220 yr .",
    "the core identified by @xcite ( b ) is not consistent with the motions presented here .",
    "rather , this component appears to be a jet component speeding towards the northwestern hot spot ( c ) at 0.060@xmath200.026 mas yr@xmath7 .",
    "component b most likely represents the base of the jet with an obscured core to the immediate southeast .",
    "identified with a galaxy of magnitude 18.5 and a redshift of 0.299 @xcite , we can now classify this source as a cso due to its edge - brightened lobes having steep spectra ( @xmath210.9 and @xmath170.8 ) and a separation speed @xmath10.013 mas yr@xmath7 , or @xmath10.19  c , where a is the reference .",
    "this gives an age limit of 1360 yr .",
    "this source is classified here as a cso due to its steep spectrum double hot spots ( @xmath210.8 ) . with component b as the reference",
    ", the hot spots are moving away from each other at a speed @xmath10.010 mas yr@xmath7 for an age limit of 690 yr .",
    "as a cso candidate this object appears to have a central core ( b1 or b2 ) with a jet extending to the northwest ( c and d ) and a faint counter - jet or hot spot to the southeast ( a ) .",
    "however , the spectral indices of all the components are flat ( @xmath210.2 and @xmath170.4 ) and no reliable motions are detected .",
    "it is worth pointing out that this is a difficult source to modelfit because of its extended structure .",
    "this cso has been associated with a galaxy of magnitude 19.9 and a redshift of 0.190 by @xcite .",
    "it has a bent northern lobe ( b ) and an edge - brightened southern lobe ( a ) .",
    "there are no detectable motions within the upper limit of 0.014 mas yr@xmath7 , or 0.14  c. this gives a lower limit to the age of 2030 yr .",
    "also known as pks  1413@xmath0135 , this cso has also been classified as a bl lac object due to its optical properties @xcite .",
    "this proved to be an unusual object from the start as it was later found to be the first bl lac to be associated with a disk galaxy ( @xmath22 19.6 , @xmath23 0.25 ) from optical images , hi absorption , and extinction in the near infrared @xcite .",
    "this disk also gives rise to evidence of molecular absorption in the line - of - sight of the nucleus @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite suggested that the bl lac could be a background quasar that has been gravitationally lensed by the foreground spiral based on the fact that there was no thermal ir emission that would normally be expected for a spiral host .",
    "however , much of the evidence to date confirms that the radio object is a part of the optical galaxy , not lensed by it @xcite .",
    "@xcite imaged a core , jet , and counter - jet on vlbi scales at 1.6 and 8.4  ghz , putting the bl lac classification in jeopardy with regard to the unified schemes of agn .",
    "later , @xcite confirmed at 1.4 , 2.3 , 4.8 , and 8.4  ghz that no double images existed as evidence of lensing and that the source most likely resembled the members of the cso class .",
    "the northeastern counterjet vanishes at high frequencies .",
    "in addition to the epochs listed above , we used calibrated data from @xcite from july 1994 and 1995 for a longer timeline . however , our 2002.919 epoch could not be properly modelfit on this complex source and was not used for the motion analysis .",
    "the total flux was drastically lower in 2000.227 than in the other 4 epochs ( @xmath260% ) .",
    "most of this drop was in component c ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , confirming the classification of this as the core with its extreme variability .",
    "there was also a drop in the flux of the newest jet component , c3 .",
    "the core was used as the reference component for the proper motion analysis .",
    "the counter - jet component east of the core ( b2 ) has a motion over the 4 epochs at 0.060@xmath200.024 mas yr@xmath7 , corresponding to a velocity of 0.80@xmath200.30  c. this gives an age of 130@xmath2047 yr ( see fig .",
    "5 ) for this component .",
    "the jet component closest to the core ( c3 ) , appears to be only 22@xmath202 yr old due to a larger proper motion of 0.087@xmath200.009 mas yr@xmath24 , or a velocity of 1.10@xmath200.11  c. this velocity , however , is only 25% of that measured by @xcite at 15  ghz .    for two - sided sources",
    "it is often possible to obtain information about the true jet velocities , including both speed and orientation ( e.g. , taylor & vermeulen 1997 ) . for simultaneously ejected components moving in opposite directions at an angle @xmath25 to the line of sight at a velocity @xmath26",
    ", it follows directly from the light travel time difference that the ratio of apparent projected distances from the origin ( @xmath27 for the approaching side , @xmath28 for the receding side ) as well as the ratio of apparent motions ( approaching : @xmath29 , receding : @xmath30 ) is given at any time by @xmath31 given the discrepant ages for c3 and b2 , we can not make the assumption that they were ejected at the same time .",
    "if , however , we assume that their velocities are characteristic of jet and counterjet velocities in pks  1413@xmath0135 , then we obtain @xmath32=1.45 , or @xmath33 .",
    "this requires that @xmath26 is greater than 0.18 , and that @xmath25 is less than 80 .",
    "the rapid , and extreme variability for the core component suggests a small angle to the line - of - sight , which could be consistent with the doppler boosting model if the jets are initially slow .",
    "why the jet should fade so quickly on the jet side compared to the counter - jet side ( fig .",
    "4 ) is unclear , and could indicate that explaining asymmetries in terms of a simple doppler model is invalid for this source .",
    "this bright , compact cso is associated with a magnitude 20 galaxy of redshift 0.55 @xcite .",
    "it was classified as a complex morphology compact steep spectrum ( css ) source by @xcite based on their 4.8  ghz vlbi observations .",
    "there is most likely missing extended emission on vlbi scales because the total flux at 8.4  ghz for these three observations is lower than the flux measured with the vla at the same frequency ( 663 , 543 , and 602 mjy with vlba , this paper ; 909 mjy with vla , * ? ? ?",

    ". it would be interesting to determine the faraday rotation measures for the first time in csos .",
    "for completeness we note that two cso candidates in the southern sky also show polarization ( j0204@xmath172132 and j1419@xmath171928 ) and one cso shows a possible detection of polarization ( j0735@xmath171735 , 0.2% ) in @xcite .    for the 6 csos with identifiable cores , the percentage of the total flux at 8.4  ghz that is attributed to the core ranges from 4 to 86% ( see table 4 ) . in three of these ( j0204@xmath00903 , j1415@xmath01320 , and j1826@xmath01831 )",
    ", there is is a clear difference in the length and brightness of the jet and counter - jet of each , suggesting an orientation close to the line - of - sight .",
    "two of these sources ( j0427@xmath04133 and j1546@xmath00026 ) are compact , and the final one ( j0003@xmath04807 ) has only a weakly visible core ( 4% the total flux ) .",
    "this suggests that certain conditions must exist for the core to be visible , such as jet axis orientation .    on vla scales ,",
    "variability of csos has been shown to be constant to within 1% over time periods of 1 week to 10 months @xcite .",
    "although our experiment was not set up to accurately monitor the total fluxes , the variation stays under 10% for most of the sources in the sample ( fig .",
    "7 ) , and is likely to be instrumental in origin .",
    "some of the outliers include the core dominated source j1415@xmath01320 ( see fig .",
    "4 ) and j1546@xmath00026 , the cso candidates j1311@xmath01658 and j0132@xmath05620 , and the csos j1816@xmath03457 , j1826@xmath01831 , and j2203@xmath01007 .",
    "it is expected that core - dominated csos would vary , and the variability of the two cso candidates could indicate that they are likely to be either core - dominated csos , or core - jets .",
    "it is not understood why three csos in this sample vary by as much as 30% over a five year time period , though no careful studies of cso variability have yet been carried out to explore this time - scale .",
    "we have detected motions in the hot spots of 3 sources , yielding new kinematic age estimates .",
    "we also find motions in both the jet and counterjet of the unusual cso j1415 + 1320 ( pks 1413 + 135 ) .",
    "we place limits on the kinematic ages for 10 more sources . when combined with kinematic age estimates from the literature we find that 7 of 13 sources are under 500 years old .",
    "longer time baselines are needed to detect motions of the slow moving components , primarily the hot spots , in csos and to accurately determine the ages of the objects for which only limits have been determined . for these csos , ranging in redshift from 0.19 to 0.61 , the sampling interval chosen of 2 years was a bit short , with most sources appearing very nearly identical from epoch to epoch .",
    "it is worth noting that the apparent expansion velocity of the cso pks 1934 - 638 over a time baseline of 32.1 yr is similar . @xcite .",
    "the completeness of the identification of redshifts for the sample ( @xmath10 50% ) could also be improved upon and would allow for the determination of projected velocities and linear sizes .",
    "in the course of our study we discovered linear polarization in the jets of the csos j0000@xmath04054 ( 2.1% ) and j1826@xmath01831 ( 8.8% ) .",
    "these are the first confirmed csos to be detected in polarization . in both cases the polarization is found on the side of the stronger jet .",
    "this is consistent with unified schemes since the faraday depth on the approaching side should be less , though still significant .",
    "sensitive , multi - frequency vlbi observations of these sources to determine their faraday rotation measures should be carried out .",
