    "type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) are believed to represent the thermonuclear disruptions of c  o white dwarfs , when these white dwarfs reach the chandrasekhar limit and ignite carbon at their centres .",
    "the favoured scenario for sn ia progenitors is the single  degenerate model , in which the wd accretes from a subgiant or giant companion ( livio 2000 ) .",
    "suspected sn ia progenitors are the recurrent novae ( rne )  a small class of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) which show repeated nova outbursts on a timescale of decades . to produce such short intervals between outbursts ,",
    "the thermonuclear runaway model requires a near  chandrasekhar mass white dwarf ( starrfield , sparks & shaviv 1988 ) .    despite the ejection of material during a nova event ,",
    "most of the accreted material remains on the surface of the white dwarf ( hachisu et al . 2000 ) .",
    "further accretion of mass onto a massive white dwarf will result in the chandrasekhar limit being overcome , and the subsequent detonation of the white dwarf to produce a sn ia .",
    "an observational determination of the white dwarf mass in rne is therefore crucial in assessing whether rne are sn ia progenitors .",
    "we present spectroscopy of the eclipsing recurrent nova u  sco .",
    "the radial velocity semi - amplitude of the primary star was found to be @xmath2 kms@xmath3 from the motion of the wings of the heii@xmath4@xmath5 emission line ( fig.1 ) . by detecting weak absorption features from the secondary star , we find its radial velocity semi - amplitude to be @xmath6 kms@xmath3 ( fig.2 ) . from these parameters ,",
    "we obtain a mass of @xmath0 for the white dwarf primary star and a mass of @xmath7 for the secondary star .",
    "the radius of the secondary is calculated to be @xmath8 , confirming that it is evolved .",
    "the inclination of the system is calculated to be @xmath9 , consistent with the deep eclipse seen in the lightcurves .",
    "the helium emission lines are double - peaked , with the blue - shifted regions of the disc being eclipsed prior to the red - shifted regions , clearly indicating the presence of an accretion disc .",
    "the high mass of the white dwarf is consistent with the thermonuclear runaway model of recurrent nova outbursts , and confirms that u  sco is the best type ia supernova progenitor currently known .",
    "assuming an average white dwarf growth rate of @xmath10 y@xmath3 ( hachisu et al .",
    "2000 ) , we predict that u  sco is likely to explode within @xmath1 years .",
