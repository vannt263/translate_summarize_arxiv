    "this problem was introduced in the 70s by dancer and fuk ( see @xcite ) , for constant weights @xmath7 .",
    "they were interested in problems with jumping non - linearities , and they obtained for @xmath2 , @xmath8 that has a nontrivial solution corresponding to @xmath9 if and only if :    * @xmath10 , for any @xmath11 , * @xmath12 , for any @xmath13 , * @xmath14 belong to the following families of hyperbolic - like curves @xmath15 , @xmath16    the existence of similar curves in the spectrum was proved later for non - constant weights @xmath17 by rynne in @xcite , together with several properties about simplicity of zeros , monotonicity of the eigenvalues respect to the pair of weights , continuity and differentiability of the curves , and the asymptotic behavior of the curves when @xmath18 or @xmath19 . for sign - changing weights ,",
    "similar results were obtained by alif and gossez , and they can be found in @xcite .",
    "all these results were generalized for half - linear differential equations involving the one dimensional @xmath20laplacian operator , @xmath21 with different boundary conditions , see for instance section 6.3.3 in @xcite for the constant coefficient case , or @xcite where indefinite weights @xmath2 , @xmath22 and different boundary conditions were considered .    by using shooting arguments rynne proved that the spectrum of problem can be described as an union of curves @xmath23",
    "the curves @xmath24 are called the trivial curves since the eigenfunctions does not changes signs , we can write @xmath25 , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 denotes the first eigenvalue of problem @xmath28 the curve @xmath29 ( resp",
    ". @xmath30 ) correspond to pairs @xmath9 with a nontrivial solution having @xmath31 internal zeros and positive ( resp .",

    "let us observe that now we have two curves for @xmath31 even , in the constant coefficient case both curves coincide but this is not true for general weights .",
    "the curves @xmath29 are not known for general weights @xmath2 , @xmath22 , and only its limit behavior as @xmath18 or @xmath32 is known .",
    "this behavior is related to the sequence of eigenvalues @xmath33 of problem , and we have that :    * when @xmath34 is even , the curves @xmath35 are asymptotic to the line @xmath36 as @xmath37 ; and to the line @xmath38 as @xmath32 .",

    "quantitative bounds of the fuk spectrum are by far less common in the literature , and the qualitative description states that they are @xmath46 curves . by using the ideas in @xcite it is possible to enclose with an hyperbolic like curve the region of the plane containing the fuk eigenpairs whose corresponding eigenfunctions have @xmath31 nodal domains . here",
