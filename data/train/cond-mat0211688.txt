    "slow relaxation dynamics naturally occurs in systems with _",
    "quenched disorder _ such as spin glasses and has remained a subject of long standing interest@xcite .",
    "however , systems without quenched disorder such as structural glasses also exhibit slow dynamics .",
    "it is believed that the slow relaxation in the latter systems is due to _ kinetic disorder _ , induced by the dynamics itself@xcite . another important class of systems without quenched disorder is granular material , where once again kinetic disorders are responsible for slow relaxation . in a recent experiment@xcite ,",
    "a cylinder packed loosely with glass beads was tapped mechanically and it was found that the system gets more and more compact with time . however , the density @xmath3 compactified rather slowly with time as , @xmath4 .",
    "how robust is this inverse logarithmic relaxation ?",
    "is it only specific to granular systems or does this also occur in other out of equilibrium systems in presence of kinetic disorders ?    in this paper we study , in detail , the effect of kinetic disorders on the relaxation dynamics of an ising system quenched from a high temperature disordered phase into the low temperature ordered phase . in absence of kinetic disorders , the dynamics of such a system is well understood@xcite .",
    "as time progresses , domains of equilibrium low - temperature ordered phases ( consisting predominantly of up and down spins respectively ) form and grow .",
    "the average linear size of a domain grows with time as @xmath5 for zero temperature nonconserved dissipative dynamics",
    ". how does disorder , _ quenched _ or _ kinetic _ , affect this simple dynamics ?",
    "the effect of quenched ferromagnetic disorder on this phase ordering kinetics has been studied extensively@xcite . essentially the quenched disorder tends to pin the domain walls leading to complete freezing at @xmath6 .",
    "however at small nonzero temperatures , the domains still coarsen via activated dynamics but extremely slowly as , @xmath7@xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the effect of _ kinetic disorder _ on the phase ordering dynamics . a shorter version of this paper with the main analytical results and their numerical confirmation has appeared elsewhere@xcite .",
    "here we explore the dynamics in more detail and also elaborate its connection to other systems such as granular material and reaction - diffusion systems .    in this paper , we study the zero temperature dynamics of an ising chain in presence of a specific type of kinetic disorder namely a dynamically induced magnetic field .",
    "if a small uniform external field ( say in the down direction ) is put on in an ising system following a rapid quench from infinite temperature to @xmath6 , the system rapidly relaxes into a pure state with all spins down . in this case , the symmetry between the two ordered pure states is broken globally .",
    "interesting physics happens when , instead of a global external bias , the symmetry between the pure states is broken locally by the dynamics itself . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of this particular kinetic disorder and show that this system also gives rise to a very slow dynamics .",
    "in particular , it gives rise to inverse logarithmic relaxation ( ilr ) of magnetization , very similar to the density compaction in granular systems .",
    "our study therefore suggests that the ilr is a very robust phenomenon and not just limited to granular systems or specific types of kinetic disorders .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section - ii",
    ", we define our model precisely and summarize the main results . in section - iii , we establish the connection between our spin model and a lattice model of granular compaction .",
    "we also show that our model can be viewed as a new one dimensional reaction - diffusion model when the dynamics is described in terms of the kinks between domains of opposite phases . in section - iv , we derive some exact results . in section - v , we analyze the dynamics via an independent interval approximation ( iia ) . in section - vi , we argue that the iia results become exact in the limit when the initial volume fraction of one of the phases is small . in section - vii , we extend this argument to other volume fractions as well . in section - viii",
    ", we present a heuristic approach to support the iia results .",
    "finally we conclude in section - ix .",
    "we consider a simple ising spin chain with spins @xmath8 .",
    "starting from a given initial configuration the system evolves by single spin flip continuous time dynamics .",
    "the rate of flipping of a given spin depends on the its neighboring spins .",
    "we denote the rate of spin flip @xmath9 by @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the two neighboring spins . in our model",
    "the rates are specified as follows : @xmath13 note that the case @xmath14 corresponds to the usual zero temperature glauber dynamics@xcite which preserves the symmetry between the up and down phases . however , if @xmath15 , the flipping of a down spin sandwiched between two up spins is not as likely as the flipping of an up spin sandwiched between two down spins .",
    "thus @xmath15 clearly breaks the symmetry between the up and down phases .",
    "however this symmetry is broken only dynamically , i.e. not everywhere but only at at the location of the triplets @xmath16 .",
    "thus the isolated ` @xmath0 ' spins ( surrounded on both sides by a ` @xmath1 ' ) tend to block the coalescence of ` @xmath1 ' domains and locally favor the ` @xmath0 ' spins .",
    "one can argue that the asymptotic dynamics at late times is similar for any @xmath15 .",
    "in other words , @xmath17 is an attractive fixed point .",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves only to the case @xmath17 .    to see the effect of the local dynamical constraint more precisely , we derive ( following glauber s calculation for @xmath18@xcite ) the exact evolution equation for the magnetization @xmath19 for the @xmath20 case : @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the three point probability to find the sequence of spins @xmath23 about the site @xmath24 and we have used translational invariance . hence @xmath25 denotes the probability of the occurrence of the triplet ` @xmath26 ' at time @xmath27 .",
    "we note that for the case @xmath14 , @xmath28 @xcite , indicating that the magnetization does not evolve with time . in our case , due to the triplet defects ` @xmath26 ' , the average magnetization decays with time . if @xmath29 denote the fractions of ` @xmath1 ' and ` @xmath0 ' spins , then using @xmath30 we find from eq .",
    "( [ eq : em ] ) , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number density of the triplets of type ` @xmath33 ' per unit length , clearly exhibiting the asymmetry generated by the ` @xmath33 ' triplets . we also note that unlike the @xmath14 case , the evolution equation ( [ eq : em ] ) for the single point correlation function involves two and three point correlations ( via @xmath32 ) .",
    "this hierarchy makes an exact solution difficult for @xmath34 .",
    "it is useful at this point to summarize the main results obtained in this paper .",
    "let us first highlight the contrast between the @xmath18 ( no kinetic disorder ) and the @xmath17 ( with kinetic disorder ) cases .",
    "for @xmath18 , due to the preserved symmetry between the up and down phases at all times , the average domain size of both ` @xmath1 ' and ` @xmath0 ' domains grow as @xmath35 at late times@xcite .",
    "thus the average magnetization @xmath36 is a constant of motion@xcite ) and stays fixed at its initial value . in particular ,",
    "if we start from an initial state where the spins are random ( infinite temperature ) , the initial average magnetization is zero and stays @xmath37 at all subsequent times .",
    "in contrast , for @xmath17 case where the symmetry is dynamically broken , we find the following results .",
    "\\(1 ) for @xmath17 , while domains of both phases continue to grow with time , they have different growth laws .",
    "the average domain sizes of the @xmath1 phases ( denoted by @xmath38 ) and @xmath0 phases ( denoted by @xmath39 ) coarsen at late times in the following manner : ( i ) @xmath40 at late times and ( ii ) @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a number depending on the initial volume fraction of the ` @xmath1 ' spins which we will calculate explicitly ( see below ) . in fact , the main result we show below is that the ratio of the two length scales behaves at late times as , @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the initial volume fraction ( need not be small ) and @xmath45 is some initial time after which scaling starts holding .",
    "the equation ( [ ratio ] ) explicitly reflects the effect of broken symmetry . thus due to the dynamically generated local bias , the ` @xmath0 ' domains grow slightly faster than the ` @xmath1 ' domains .",
    "we also point out that in contrast to the spin models studied in the context of glassy systems@xcite , the dynamics in our model does not freeze at zero temperature , rather the domains coarsen indefinitely in an infinite system .",
    "\\(2 ) consequently , the magnetization @xmath46 decays at late times as , @xmath47    \\(3 ) evidently the number of ` @xmath1 ' domains is same as the number of of ` @xmath0 ' domains since they alternate on the @xmath48-d lattice . the density of domains of either ` @xmath1 ' or ` @xmath0 ' type per unit length : @xmath49 $ ] decays as , @xmath50    we also compute explicitly two other densities that play a somewhat central role in our analysis :    \\(4 ) @xmath51 : given that a ` @xmath0 ' domain has occurred , the probability that it is of length @xmath48 .",
    "we show below that @xmath52 note that the amplitude @xmath53 is universal and independent of volume fraction .",
    "\\(5 ) @xmath54 : given that a ` @xmath1 ' domain has occurred , the probability that it is of length @xmath48 .",
    "we show that @xmath55 once again the amplitude @xmath48 of the correction term is also universal and independent of volume fraction .",
    "the constant @xmath42 in the above equations can also be computed exactly , and we show that , @xmath56",
    "we now establish a one to one mapping between our spin model ( with @xmath17 ) and a simple lattice model of granular compaction .",
    "let us consider a @xmath57-dimensional granular packing where the grains are represented by square blocks .",
    "the pack consists of horizontal layers consisting of blocks and voids ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "we focus on the ` active ' layer , i.e. , the first horizontal layer that is not fully compact with blocks as we go up from the bottom of the pile . below this active layer , all layers are compact and remain compact under vertical tapping , i.e. , their dynamics is completely frozen .",
    "all the activities take place in or above the ` active ' layer .",
    "we identify this ` active ' layer with the one dimensional lattice of the spin model .",
    "this active layer consists of sequences of blocks ( particles ) and voids ( holes ) .",
    "we identify a unit block or a particle in the active layer as a ` @xmath0 ' spin of our spin model .",
    "similarly a hole is identified as a ` @xmath1 ' spin of the spin model .",
    "as the system is tapped vertically , the particles in the active layer can undergo the following moves : ( 1 ) in the interior of a row of consecutive particles in the active layer , there is no effect of tapping as the system is completely jammed there .",
    "the effect of vertical tapping is felt only at the edges of a particle cluster .",
    "the particles at the edges , under tapping , can move up or ` tap ' up from the active layer to the layers above the active layer ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . however if the cluster consists of an isolated particle sandwiched between two holes , it has no place to move up , so it stays at its original location .",
    "( 2 ) tapping also can ` roll ' off a particle residing in a layer above the active layer , into the active layer , at the edges of the supporting cluster ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    let us now see what the rates of spin flips in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rates ] ) in the spin model imply for the compaction model .",
    "the rate @xmath58 implies that if we have three consecutive holes in the active layer , then a particle can not be deposited in the middle site under tapping .",
    "this is because a new particle can appear into the active layer only at the edges of the clusters of particles , but not in the middle of a cluster of voids .",
    "the rate @xmath59 implies that if we have three consecutive particles in the active layer , the middle particle can not move up under tapping since it is completely jammed .",
    "the rate @xmath60 signifies that if we have three consecutive sites in the active layer consisting respectively of a particle , hole and a hole , then a particle can appear in the middle hole with rate @xmath61 .",
    "this is ` rolling ' off move to the right at the edge of a cluster , as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "similarly @xmath62 signifies the ` rolling ' off move to the left .",
    "the rate @xmath63 implies that when we have three consecutive sites in the active layer consisting respectively of a hole , particle and a particle , the middle particle can disappear ( into the layers above ) with rate @xmath61 . this is the ` tapping ' up move to the right from the edge of a cluster as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "similarly @xmath64 signifies the rate of ` tapping ' up to the left from the edge of a cluster .",
    "the rate @xmath65 indicates that if we have a sequence of particle , hole , particle in the active layer , the middle hole can be filled up with a particle with rate @xmath48 .",
    "this is simply the addition of two ` rolling ' off rates from the left and the right of the middle hole .",
    "finally the rate @xmath66 implies that if we have a sequence of hole , particle , hole in the active layer , the middle particle can not disappear .",
    "this is because an isolated particle has no place to move or ` tap ' up as discussed in the previous paragraph .",
    "this last rate indeed breaks the particle hole symmetry .",
    "note that the rates @xmath67 correspond to the diffusion of domain walls in the spin model . in the compaction model ,",
    "these are indeed the moves induced by the mechanical tapping .",
    "if these rates were zero , i.e. , no tapping , then the dynamics in the active layer would freeze after all the isolated holes are filled up and the system will be stuck in a metastable configuration and hence the compaction will stop .",
    "it is these diffusion moves that lift the system out of a metastable configuration and the system continues to compactify , though extremely slowly . identifying the ` - ' ( + ) spins with particles ( holes ) in the granular model , it is easy to see that the average magnetization @xmath68 in the spin model is related to the average particle density @xmath3 in the granular model via the simple relation , @xmath69 .",
    "thus the result in eq .",
    "( [ mag ] ) for the magnetization indicates that the density will grow to its fully compact value @xmath48 as @xmath70 at very late times , as observed in experiments on mechanically tapped granular media@xcite .",
    "other one dimensional lattice models , notably the ` car parking ' model , has been previously used to explain the logarithmic relaxation in granular materials@xcite .",
    "the local rules for the dynamics of particles in the car parking model are , however , quite different from those in our model . in the parking model ,",
    "the rules for the particle motion are : ( i ) a new particle can be absorbed only at sites containing a hole at a rate proportional to the number of neighboring particles and ( ii ) a particle evaporates with a small rate ( thus leaving behind a hole ) if it has one and only one neighboring hole .",
    "while this model also exhibits an inverse logarithmic growth of the density , the dynamical moves ( in particular the fact that the desorption rate is infinitesimally small ) are chosen in a somewhat ad hoc manner .",
    "in contrast , as explained via the mapping detailed above , our model incorporates the basic minimal microscopic moves of the particles that are observed in the compaction process .    in terms of the motion of the domain walls between ` @xmath1 ' and ` @xmath0 ' phases , our model can also be considered a new model of two species reaction - diffusion in one dimension .",
    "we note that in the case @xmath14 , the domain walls diffuse and annihilate upon contact .",
    "this corresponds to the process @xmath71 @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath34 , we need to distinguish between the two types of domain walls @xmath72 and @xmath73 . note that by definition ( originating from a spin configuration ) the @xmath74 s and @xmath75 s always occur alternately . here",
    "both @xmath74 s and @xmath75 s diffuse as before ; however when an @xmath74 and a @xmath75 meet , they annihilate only if @xmath74 is to the left of @xmath75 , otherwise there is hard core repulsion between them",
    ". we will show below that this hard core repulsion between the particles is a relevant interaction that changes the late time dynamics considerably .",
    "recently the relevance of hard core repulsion between particles in reaction - diffusion systems have been explored in a number of contexts@xcite .",
    "to start with we write down two exact relations which are derived directly from the glauber dynamics ( we shall see later that these exact relations are in fact respected by the iia approximation ) .",
    "let @xmath76 be the number of domains of either ` @xmath1 ' or ` @xmath0 ' spins per unit length .",
    "the density of kinks is therefore @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 be the density of the triplets ` @xmath79 ' per unit length , then clearly @xmath80 .",
    "we note also that the only way in which a domain can be destroyed in an infinitesimal time step is by flipping an isolated ` @xmath1 ' spin in a triplet ` @xmath79 ' .",
    "this gives @xmath81 if @xmath82 denotes the probability that the spin at site @xmath24 takes the value @xmath83 , the evolution of @xmath82 depends only on the rates in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rates ] ) and the three point probability distribution @xmath84 . the evolution of @xmath82",
    "is then given by @xmath85 substituting @xmath86 in the above equation we find @xmath87 where we have used the evident left to right symmetries @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "we now observe that @xmath90 and @xmath91 and thus find @xmath92 we note that @xmath93 is simply the probability that at a given site the spin is a ` @xmath0 ' spin and its two neighbors are ` @xmath1 ' spins , that is to say that their is a ` @xmath26 ' defect at the site considered .",
    "if we now sum this equation over each site on an interval of unit length on the lattice and recall that @xmath94 is the density of the ` @xmath26 ' triplets per unit length , we obtain @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the fraction of the ` @xmath1 ' spins .",
    "note that @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the fraction of the ` @xmath0 ' spins . from the relation eq .",
    "( [ exactr : l ] ) we obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : em ] ) for the evolution of the average magnetization @xmath68 .",
    "physically it is easy to see the origin of eq .",
    "( [ exactr : l ] ) as , on an average , the fraction of ` @xmath1 ' spins can decrease only due to the blockage by ` @xmath26 ' triplets .",
    "writing eq .",
    "( [ exactr : l ] ) in terms of @xmath99 and the average length of the ` @xmath1 ' domains @xmath100 we obtain @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",

    "all the results presented above are exact . to derive the late time behavior of the model we first consider below the iia .",

    "( [ nsol1 ] ) and differentiating with respect to @xmath27 , we find a differential equation for @xmath76 , @xmath172 introducing the dimensionless variable @xmath173 in eq .",
    "( [ nsol2 ] ) we find @xmath174 where @xmath175 .",
    "integrating eq .",
    "( [ nsol3 ] ) we find @xmath176 we thus obtain the result @xmath177 substituting this result in the expression , @xmath157 , we get @xmath178 next we use the late time result eq .",

    "( [ exactp : n ] ) and find , @xmath179    let us check the two self - consistency conditions , ( a ) @xmath155 and ( b ) @xmath166 . using the expression for @xmath180 from eq .",
    "( [ p1final ] ) and that of @xmath76 from eq .",
    "( [ nfinal ] ) , it is immediately evident that indeed these two conditions are satisfied for large @xmath27 . thus our whole approach has been completely self - consistent and the iia results are precisely those mentioned in the abstract . note also that @xmath45 must be sufficiently large such that both scaling laws , @xmath181 and @xmath182 start holding for @xmath183 .",
    "in this section , we show that the iia results essentially become exact in the zero volume fraction limit of the ` @xmath1 ' phase , i.e. , in the limit @xmath184 .",
    "suppose we start from an initial condition such that , @xmath185 and @xmath186 .",
    "this means that in the initial condition , the average length of the ` @xmath0 ' domains , @xmath187 , whereas @xmath188 .",
    "thus the ` @xmath0 ' domains are typically much larger than the ` @xmath1 ' domains , in the limit @xmath189 .",
    "also initially all the domains are completely uncorrelated .",
    "so the picture is as follows .",
    "we have little droplets of ` @xmath1 ' phase in a sea of ` @xmath0 ' phase .",
    "besides , one can also compute the initial density of domains of either ` @xmath1 ' or ` @xmath0 ' types .",
    "it is given by , @xmath190 to leading order in @xmath44 .",
    "now let us consider the time evolution of the system starting from this initial condition .",
    "as time increases , the ` @xmath1 ' domains will certainly grow in size .",
    "but a typical ` @xmath1 ' domain will disappear ( via the absorbing boundary condition ) much before encountering other ` @xmath1 ' domains , i.e. , before feeling the presence of the constraint due to triplets ` @xmath26 ' .",
    "the probability of such an event is of order @xmath191 .",
    "thus effectively , the dynamics of the system will proceed via eating up of the ` @xmath1 ' domains . hence",
    ", if there is no correlation between domains in the initial condition , the dynamics is not going to generate correlations between them .",
    "this is precisely what happens in the zero temperature dynamics of the @xmath192 state potts model in @xmath48-d in the limit @xmath193@xcite .",
    "thus in this limit , the evolution of the ` @xmath0 ' domains is governed by the exact equation , @xmath147 , \\label{epsr_n}\\ ] ] which is same as the iia equation eq .",
    "( [ eq : r_n ] ) without the diffusion term .",
    "starting from the initial condition , @xmath194 , one can solve the above equation for any @xmath27 exactly to leading order in @xmath44 .",
    "it turns out that , to leading order in @xmath44 , eq . ( [ epsr_n ] ) admits a solution , @xmath195^{n-1}$ ] , where @xmath196 $ ] .",
    "using once again , the exact equation @xmath151 , we find , @xmath197 where we have used @xmath198 .",
    "thus we get , @xmath199    now , let us consider the evolution of the ` @xmath1 ' domains .",
    "since a typical ` @xmath1 ' domain never encounters ( to leading order in @xmath44 ) any other ` @xmath1 ' domain and hence does not feel the constraint due to @xmath143 s , the effective dynamics of a ` @xmath1 ' domain is that of a single ` @xmath1 ' domain immersed in a sea of ` @xmath0 ' phase .",
    "let @xmath200 denote the probability that such a domain is of length @xmath112 .",
    "then , to leading order in @xmath44 , @xmath200 s clearly evolve by the simple diffusion equation , @xmath201 with the absorbing boundary condition , @xmath130 .",
    "the normalized conditional probability , @xmath202 with @xmath203 , then satisfies the equation , @xmath204 same as eq .",
    "( [ ap_n ] ) .",
    "this equation has to be solved with the initial condition , @xmath205 .",
    "it can be solved exactly . without writing the explicit solution",
    ", we just mention the result for @xmath206 .",
    "we find that for large @xmath27 and leading order in @xmath44 , @xmath207    using the results from eqs .",
    "( [ epsr_1 ] ) and ( [ epsl+ ] ) , i.e. , ( i ) @xmath208 and ( ii ) @xmath209 in the exact equation eq .",
    "( [ nsol1 ] ) , we once again recover all the iia results of the previous section , with @xmath210 .",
    "hence iia becomes exact in the @xmath189 limit .",
    "this is not surprising as the dynamics in this limit does not generate correlations if there are none in the initial condition .",
    "for finite initial volume fraction of the ` @xmath1 ' phase , the iia can not be exact since the diffusion of kinks correlate the domains as time progresses , even if the domains had no correlations to start with .",
    "however , the volume fraction of the ` @xmath1 ' phase decreases monotonically with time according to the exact equation eq .",
    "( [ exactr : l ] ) .",
    "thus at very late times when the volume fraction @xmath211 is very small , the effective fixed point picture of the system is very similar to the @xmath189 limit picture , i.e. , small ` @xmath1 ' domains immersed in the sea of ` @xmath0 ' domains .",
    "the only difference is that the big ` @xmath0 ' domains may now be correlated .",
    "however , it is very likely ( though we can not prove this rigorously ) that the correlations between domains are very small at very late times and therefore the iia results ( ( 1)-(4 ) in the abstract ) become asymptotically exact .",
    "the numerical results reported in @xcite appear to confirm this fact .",
    "actually if this late time fixed point picture is correct , then one can derive all the results from a very simple heuristic argument , presented below .",
    "the heuristic picture is as follows . due to the facts that ` @xmath1 ' domains can grow only by diffusion and the ` @xmath0 ' domains grow by diffusion and coalescence , one expects that at late times the ratio @xmath212 ; this is also clear from eq .",
    "( [ exactr : l ] ) .",
    "therefore at late times one expects to find ` @xmath1 ' domains sandwiched between much larger ` @xmath0 ' domains .",
    "consequently the ` @xmath1 ' domains , to a first approximation , never encounter the ` @xmath26 ' triplets at late times and hence diffuse freely and annihilate via the disappearance of ` @xmath79 ' triplets .",
    "therefore the length of a @xmath1 domain behaves as a diffusion with a killing boundary condition at the origin . solving the discrete diffusion equation corresponding to this picture ( see eq .",
    "( [ epsp_n ] ) ) , one finds that at late times @xmath213 if one now views the system at the length scale of the ` @xmath0 ' domains @xmath214 , one sees long stretches of ` @xmath0 ' domains occasionally interrupted by ` @xmath1 ' domains which are now shrunk to a single point when viewed from the length scale of the ` @xmath0 ' domains .",
    "the rate of occurrence of these points per unit length @xmath215 is clearly proportional to @xmath76 , i.e. , the kink density .",
    "note that @xmath146 is simply the conditional probability : given that a ` @xmath0 ' domain has occurred , what is the probability that it is of length @xmath112 .",
    "now if one assumes that these punctual ` @xmath1 ' domains ( or the points ) are distributed randomly , one finds that @xmath146 is simply given by the geometric distribution , @xmath216 where @xmath217 for some constant @xmath218 .",
    "we therefore find @xmath219 for late times .",
    "furthermore , if we denote by @xmath45 a large time after which this picture becomes valid we may write @xmath220    these two expressions for @xmath143 and @xmath221 once again are same as obtained by a more careful analysis of the iia equations and when substituted in eq .",
    "( [ nsol1 ] ) , they give the same iia results once again .",
    "thus the basic assumption of this heuristic picture is the ` @xmath1 ' domains occur randomly , which seems like an accurate description at late times .",
    "in this paper we have presented detailed analytical studies on a simple one dimensional kinetically constrained ising model which was introduced in ref.@xcite .",
    "the kinetic constraints in this model are local and dynamically generated .",
    "the effect of these constraints was shown to slow down the dynamics rather drammatically .",
    "we have shown that the average magnetization in this model decays extremely slowly with time in an inverse logarithmic fashion to its final saturation value .",
    "this kind of inverse logarithmic law was observed in the behavior of the density of granular material in experiments on granular compaction@xcite and was also seen in numerical simulations of various lattice based and ` tetris ' like models@xcite .",
    "there have been some theoretical arguments proposing various mechanisms responsible for this slow compaction@xcite .",
    "these include the free volume argument@xcite and the argument based on an analogy with car parking models with the somewhat ad hoc assumption that the cars ` depark ' from a lane at an infinitesimal rate@xcite .",
    "in contrast , in this paper we have mapped our kinetic ising model _ directly _ to a lattice model of granular compaction which incorporates the basic minimal microscopic moves in the compaction process .",
    "the average magnetization @xmath222 in the ising model , via this mapping , gets related to the density of compaction @xmath3 in the granular model as @xmath223 . hence , besides having nontrivial behavior and yet analytically solvable , our toy model of granular compaction correctly reproduces the inverse logarithmic time dependence seen in the experiments@xcite and thereby proposes a new and entirely different mechanism for this slow compaction , quite different from the previous models such as the car parking models .",
    "it is also interesting to note a study of compaction in the tetris model @xcite shows that at late times the activity of the system , leading to compaction , occurs at boundaries between domains which can be identified in the system .",
    "the image of compaction as a kinetically hindered coarsening process thus appears to be quite robust .    from a somewhat broader perspective",
    ", our work addresses a general question : what is the effect of kinetically generated disorders on the coarsening dynamics in domain growth problems ? in the present work we have studied a specific type of kinetic disorder , namely a dynamically generated local magnetic field . this field acts locally on the topological defects responsible for the coarsening process ( in this case simple domain walls ) .",
    "our study suggests that such kinetic disorders , while slowing down the dynamics drastically , do not altogether inhibit the coarsening process as found in other constrained kinetic ising models@xcite .",
    "the domain growth problems are rather common and occur in various physical systems@xcite .",
    "our work , therefore , opens up the possibility of studying the slowing down in coarsening dynamics due to kinetic disorders in many of these systems .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to study the effect of dynamically generated local fields in higher dimensionional ising models , in @xmath224 vector spin models and in liquid crystals , to mention a few .",
    "it is possible to have other types of local kinetic disorders than the one studied here and it would also be interesting to study their effect in coarsening systems .",
