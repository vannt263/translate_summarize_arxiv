    "more recently , the study of related quantities such as shannon - rnyi entropies ( which quantify the localization of the wave - function in a given basis ) in _ many - body _ problems has revealed an intriguing aspect : subleading terms in the finite - size scaling of these quantities appear to carry universal information , characteristic of the physics contained in the ground - state wave - function@xcite .",
    "for instance , they can characterize the presence of broken continuous or discrete symmetry breaking in the ground - state , as well as information on the universality class of continuous phase transitions .",
    "most previous studies@xcite on this topic focused on one - dimensional quantum systems , where both analytical and numerical studies are easiest .",
    "in particular , dealing with the exponentially growing size of the hilbert space of many - body problems , while maintaining a large enough total system size to study finite - size dependence , is a hurdle to surmount .",
    "recently , we have introduced in ref .",
    "convenient numerical methods to study the shannon - rnyi entropies of many - body systems through a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) sampling of the ground - state wave function .",
    "this method allows studies of much larger systems than previously accessible in numerical calculations , which is necessary for the analysis of universal behavior at continuous quantum phase transitions where physical correlation lengths diverge .    here , we will study this problem for a non - trivial , yet well - understood quantum phase transition in two - dimensional quantum magnetism : the transition between a nel antiferromagnet and a quantum paramagnet in two @xmath8 quantum spin heisenberg models with varying antiferromagnetic couplings , namely two - dimensional coupled dimers and plaquettes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lattices ] ) .",

    "[ sec : sr ] ) is devoted to the study of the behavior of subleading terms in the sr entropies of the ground - state of heisenberg magnets . given a density matrix @xmath13 ,",

    ", we naturally expect @xmath25 to be ` small ' in the nel phase , and ` large ' in the quantum disordered phase .",

    ", we next consider in sec .",
    "[ sec : srline ] the scaling of the sr entropy of a subsystem , composed of a single line of size @xmath3 ( the geometry of the subsystem is defined in fig .",

    "( [ eq : sr - entropies ] ) , except that we now consider the _ reduced _ density matrix @xmath36 of a subsystem @xmath37 which is obtained by performing a partial trace over the rest of the system @xmath38 : @xmath39 with @xmath40 , _",
    "i.e. _ where the basis state @xmath41 is a tensor product state of subsystems basis states @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the rationale for choosing a line shaped subsystem is two - fold : first , we physically expect that the sr entropy of the line also contains the information about antiferromagnetic ordering ( since for instance the correlation function @xmath44 along the line is defined in terms of diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix ) .",
    "second , the sr entropy of the line has a leading term @xmath45 , and therefore takes much smaller values than for the full - system sr entropy for the same value of @xmath3 ( @xmath3 scaling versus @xmath46 scaling ) .",
    "this leads to a better accuracy and allows to reach much larger linear sizes @xmath3 in our qmc simulations .",
    "our results indicate that the sr entropy of the line also shows a sub - leading @xmath47 term in the nel phase , and a constant term in the disordered phase which turns out to vanish ( see below ) . quite interestingly",
    ", the subleading term right at the quantum phase transition is a constant @xmath48 , which appears to be identical ( within error bars ) for the two models studied .",
    "this suggest that this constant is characteristic of the 3d @xmath1 universality class to which both quantum phase transitions belong .",
    "further simulations of the finite - temperature ordering phase transition of the simple cubic @xmath8 heisenberg model ( also in the same @xmath1 universality class ) support this conjecture for antiferromagnetic interactions .",
    "we also expect a universal value @xmath49 for the full system , even though the limited accuracy ( due to the large value of @xmath32 ) of our simulations does not allow to prove this .    for the verification of the universality of @xmath50",
    ", we have first performed extensive calculations of the spin stiffness in order to extract the best estimate for the value of the transition temperature , @xmath51 , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "the sr entropies are global averages of all coefficients of the wave - function and their scaling with the ( sub- ) system size thus capture correctly phases and phase transitions .",
    "it is interesting to ask whether _ each individual _ coefficient ( or reduced density matrix diagonal element in the case of subsystems ) also `` sees '' the quantum phase transition when @xmath52 is varied  this independently of their scaling with system size , as exemplified with the maximal diagonal entry of the ( reduced ) density matrix , governing @xmath31 ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "motivated by this question , we study in the second part of the paper ( sec .  [ sec : ps ] ) the behavior of each diagonal element of the reduced density matrix @xmath54 for a line subsystem across the transition . in analogy with the entanglement spectrum @xcite",
    ", we define the `` participation spectrum '' as the set of pseudo - energies @xmath55 .",
    "the participation spectrum develops into well - defined bands , which can be classified according to the magnetization and the number of ferromagnetic domain - walls separating segments having different nel line configurations ( @xmath56 or @xmath57 .",
    "identifying the lowest - lying states in this spectrum allows to understand the quantum phase transition in terms of an effective repulsion between such domain - walls . even though the participation spectra appear to differ at first glance in the quantum disordered phases of the two studied models , we find that this can be understood easily by classifying states according to the number of strong or weak domain walls ( this notion is dictated by the local physics of one of the two models considered ) .",
    "a striking outcome of this analysis is that _ all _ individual levels ( even corresponding to assumedly irrelevant states such as the fully polarized state ) harbor signs of the quantum phase transition , as exemplified for instance by an inflection point ( with respect to @xmath52 ) for almost all @xmath58 .",
    "we analyze this in detail for the most probable state .",
    "another interesting sign of the quantum phase transition is revealed by the study of the finite - size behavior of the width of the lowest - lying bands .",

    "<S> universal features in the scalings of shannon - rnyi entropies of many - body groundstates are studied for interacting spin-@xmath0 systems across ( 2 + 1 ) dimensional @xmath1 critical points , using quantum monte carlo simulations on dimerized and plaquettized heisenberg models on the square lattice . </S>",
    "<S> considering both full systems and line shaped subsystems , @xmath2 symmetry breaking on the nel ordered side of the transition is characterized by the presence of a logarithmic term in the scaling of shannon - rnyi entropies , which is absent in the disordered gapped phase . </S>",
    "<S> such a difference in the scalings allows to capture the quantum critical point using shannon - rnyi entropies for line shaped subsystems of length @xmath3 embedded in @xmath4 tori , as the smaller subsystem entropies are numerically accessible to much higher precision than for the full system . </S>",
    "<S> most interestingly , at the quantum phase transition an additive subleading constant @xmath5 emerges in the critical scaling of the line shannon - rnyi entropy @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> this number appears to be universal for 3d @xmath1 criticality , as confirmed for the finite - temperature transition in the 3d antiferromagnetic spin-@xmath0 heisenberg model . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , the phases and phase transition can be detected in several features of the participation spectrum , consisting of the diagonal elements of the reduced density matrix of the line subsystem . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the nel ordering transition can be simply understood in the @xmath7 basis by a confinement mechanism of ferromagnetic domain walls . </S>"
