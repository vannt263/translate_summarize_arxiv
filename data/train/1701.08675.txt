    "the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been the most successful phenomenological theory specially after the discovery of its last missing piece , the higgs boson at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) back in 2012 with subsequent null results for beyond standard model ( bsm ) searches . however , the sm fails to address several observed phenomena as well as theoretical questions .",
    "for example , it fails to explain the sub - ev neutrino mass @xcite , the origin of parity violation in weak interactions and the origin of three fermion families .",
    "the first two questions can be naturally addressed within the framework of the left - right symmetric model ( lrsm ) @xcite , one of the most widely studied bsm frameworks .",
    "these models not only explain tiny neutrino masses naturally through seesaw mechanism but also give rise to an effective parity violating sm at low energy through spontaneous breaking of a parity preserving symmetry at high scale .",
    "the conventional lrsm based on the gauge group @xmath3 can be enhanced to a more general lrsm based on the gauge group @xmath4 ( or in short @xmath5 ) .",
    "the advantage of such an up gradation of the gauge symmetry is the ability of the latter in providing an explanation to the origin of three fermion families of the sm in addition to having other generic features of the lrsm .",
    "in such a model , the number of three fermion generations is no longer a choice , but a necessity in order to cancel chiral anomalies . in such models , where the usual lepton and quark representations are enlarged from a fundamental of @xmath6 in the sm to a fundamental of @xmath7",
    ", the number of generations must be equal to the number of colors in order to cancel the anomalies @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast with the sm or the usual lrsm where the gauge anomalies are canceled within each fermion generation separately .",
    "one can also build such a sequential @xmath5 model by including additional chiral fermions .",
    "but since such a model does not explain the origin of three families from the anomaly cancellation point of view and contain non - minimal chiral fermion content , we stick to discussing a special type of non - sequential @xmath5 model here .",
    "there have been a few works @xcite recently done within the framework of such @xmath5 models with different motivations . particularly from the origin of neutrino mass point of view , the work @xcite considered a scalar sector comprising of bitriplets plus sextets which gives rise to tiny neutrino masses through canonical type i @xcite and type ii @xcite seesaw .",
    "another recent work @xcite studied a specific @xmath5 model with bitriplet and triplet scalar fields that can explain tiny neutrino masses through inverse @xcite and linear seesaw mechanism @xcite .",
    "the earlier work @xcite considered effective higher dimensional operators to explain fermion masses in @xmath5 models while the recent work @xcite studied the model and several of its variants from lhc phenomenology point of view .",
    "here , we simply consider another possible way of generating fermion masses in @xmath5 models through the universal seesaw mechanism @xcite where all fermions acquire their masses through a common seesaw mechanism  . incorporating additional vector like fermion pairs corresponding to each fermion generation , we show that the correct fermion mass spectrum can be generated in such a model with a scalar sector where all of them transform as fundamentals under @xmath8 without the need of bi - fundamental and sextet scalars shown in @xcite for the implementation of different seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses .",
    "we also discuss the possibilities of light neutral fermions apart from sub - ev active neutrinos , their role in neutrinoless double beta decay @xmath9 and different possible symmetry breaking chains of the gauge symmetry @xmath4 to that of the sm .",
    "we show that for tev scale @xmath2 gauge bosons , the right handed neutrinos are constrained to lie around the kev mass regime having interesting consequences for @xmath10 .",
    "we find that although the pure heavy neutrino contribution to @xmath10 remains suppressed compared to the one from light neutrinos , the heavy - light neutrino mixing which can be quite large in this model without any fine - tuning , gives a large contribution to @xmath10 keeping it within experimental reach .",
    "this letter is organized as follows . in section [",
    "sec : model ] we briefly discuss the model with the details of the particle spectrum , fermion masses via universal seesaw and gauge boson masses . in sections [ sec:0nubb ] and [ sec:0nubb2 ]",
    "we discuss the contributions to @xmath10 from purely light ( heavy ) neutrinos and heavy - light neutrino mixing respectively .",
