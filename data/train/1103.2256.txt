    "the interest for the dynamical systems on a plane was aroused in connection with the idea of topological quantum calculations @xcite .",
    "the planar string is the example of such system ; we suppose that the excitations of the string may be considered as some quasiparticles with anyon statistics .",
    "recently , the non - standard point of view on elementary particles as the defects of the string condensed matter (  string - net condensation  ) was suggested @xcite .",
    "indirectly , our approach corresponds to these ideas .",
    "the cases of both closed and open string in arbitrary space - time dimensions were well - investigated in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "one of the frequently discussed objects here is the first form * i * of the world - sheet  as opposed to the second form * ii*. in this work we investigate the excitations of an infinite string on a spatial plane in terms of second form * ii * and discuss a possible interpretation of such excitations as some anyon - type quasiparticles .",
    "the complete classical theory in terms of non - standard hamiltonian variables will be constructed here .",
    "the suggested scheme is based on the geometrical approach @xcite that is a generalization of a standard geometrical approach @xcite in a string theory .",
    "certain ideas of this article can be founded in the work @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the considered strings can be viewed as embedded in four - dimensional space - time ; that is why the main points of the approach @xcite developed for @xmath1 relativistic string should be outlined .",
    "we start with the polyakov action @xmath2 where the following notations are introduced : @xmath3  metric tensor field in two - dimensional space - time @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6  scalar fields in two - dimensional space - time with isotopic index @xmath7 .",
    "the isotopic space is minkowski space - time @xmath8 with the metric tensor @xmath9 .",
    "the standard procedure @xcite leads to the equalities @xmath10 and so the objects of our consideration will be time - like world - sheets with orthonormal parametrization .",
    "we consider the infinite strings , that s why we must impose asymptotic conditions on a curve @xmath11 for any value of evolution parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the demanded conditions will be formulated later ; in the first place we ll investigate the local structure of the world - sheet .",
    "let us define the pair of light - like vectors in space @xmath8 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is an arbitrary positive constant .",
    "it is clear that we can construct the pair of orthonormal bases @xmath15 that are connected with the introduced vectors @xmath16 by the equalities @xmath17 .",
    "these bases allow us to define the vector - matrices @xmath18 : @xmath19 the stationary groups for the vectors @xmath20 will be three - parameter groups .",
    "consequently , the definition of the bases @xmath21 has three - parameter arbitrariness in each point @xmath4 .",
    "we will keep this fact in mind and eliminate this ambiguity in the next section . the important object for our subsequent considerations",
    "is the @xmath22 - valued field @xmath23 .",
    "this field is defined as follows :    @xmath24    to fulfill the reduction into d = 1 + 2 space - time we must require the matrix @xmath25 to be real , so that @xmath26 .",

    "the conformal transformations @xmath45 allow to reduce the equation ( [ 1_sys ] ) to liouville equation ; the function @xmath33 will be the only dynamical variable here . in our approach",

    "we must emphasize that in this case there are no transformations ( [ conform ] ) that reduce the equation ( [ 1_sys ] ) to liouville equation globally .",

    "3 .   the system ( [ tl_rho ] ) has a different hamiltonian structure @xcite .    from the geometrical point of view ,",
    "two kinds of the transformations ( [ group_g ] ) exist .",
    "first kind ones correspond to the conformal reparametrizations of the same world - sheet .",
    "the equalities @xmath62 extract these transformations from the group @xmath52 .",

    "these conditions are unusual in a string theory .",
    "so , the integral curvature of a world - sheet in our approach is finite : @xmath64 the quantity @xmath65 is a gauss curvature here .",
