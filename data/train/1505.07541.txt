    "since the seminal work of koenker and bassett  ( 1978 ) , quantile regression has received substantial scholarly attention as an important alternative to conventional mean regression . indeed , there now exists a large literature on the theory of quantile regression ( see , for example , koenker  ( 2005 ) , yu  _ et  al_.  ( 2003 ) , and buchinsky  ( 1998 ) for an overview ) .",
    "notably , quantile regression can be used to analyse the relationship between the conditional quantiles of the response distribution and a set of regressors , while conventional mean regression only examines the relationship between the conditional mean of the response distribution and the regressors .",
    "quantile regression can thus be used to analyse data that include censored responses .",
    "powell  ( 1984 ; 1986 ) proposed a tobit quantile regression ( tqr ) model utilising the equivariance of quantiles under monotone transformations .",
    "hahn  ( 1995 ) , buchinsky and hahn  ( 1998 ) , bilias  _ et  al_.  ( 2000 ) , chernozhukov and hong  ( 2002 ) , and tang  _ et  al_.  ( 2012 ) considered alternative approaches to estimate tqr .",
    "more recent works in the area of censored quantile regression include wang and wang  ( 2009 ) for random censoring using locally weighted censored quantile regression , wang and fygenson  ( 2009 ) for longitudinal data , chen  ( 2010 ) and lin  _ et  al_.  ( 2012 ) for doubly censored data using the maximum score estimator and weighted quantile regression , respectively , and xie  _ et  al_.  ( 2015 ) for varying coefficient models .",
    "in the bayesian framework , yu and stander  ( 2007 ) considered tqr by extending the bayesian quantile regression model of yu and moyeed  ( 2001 ) and proposed an estimation method based on markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) .",
    "a more efficient gibbs sampler for the tqr model was then proposed by kozumi and kobayashi  ( 2011 ) .",
    "further extensions of bayesian tqr have also been considered .",
    "kottas and krnjaji  ( 2009 ) and taddy and kottas  ( 2012 ) examined semiparametric and nonparametric models using dirichlet process mixture models .",
    "reich and smith  ( 2013 ) considered a semiparametric censored quantile regression model where the quantile process is represented by a linear combination of basis functions . to accommodate nonlinearity in data , zhao and",
    "lian  ( 2015 ) proposed a single - index model for bayesian tqr .",
    "furthermore , kobayashi and kozumi  ( 2012 ) proposed a model for censored dynamic panel data . for variable selection in bayesian tqr ,",
    "ji  _ et  al_.  ( 2012 ) applied the stochastic search , alhamzawi and yu  ( 2014 ) considered a @xmath2-prior distribution with a ridge parameter that depends on the quantile level , and alhamzawi  ( 2014 ) employed the elastic net .",
    "as in the case of ordinary least squares , standard quantile regression estimators are biased when one or more regressors are correlated with the error term .",
    "many authors have analysed quantile regression for uncensored response variables with endogenous regressors , such as amemiya  ( 1982 ) , powell  ( 1983 ) , abadie  _ et  al_.  ( 2002 ) , kim and muller  ( 2004 ) , ma and koenker  ( 2006 ) , chernozhukov and hansen  ( 2005 ; 2006 ; 2008 ) , and lee  ( 2007 ) .    extending the quantile regression model to simultaneously account for censored response variables and endogenous variables",
    "is a challenging issue . in the case of the conventional tobit model with endogenous regressors ,",
    "a number of studies were published in the 1970s and 1980s , such as nelson and olsen  ( 1978 ) , amemiya  ( 1979 ) , heckman  ( 1978 ) , and smith and blundell  ( 1986 ) , with more efficient estimators proposed by newey  ( 1987 ) and blundell and smith  ( 1989 ) . on the contrary",
    ", few studies have estimated censored quantile regression with endogenous regressors . while blundell and powell  ( 2007 ) introduced control variables as in lee  ( 2007 ) to deal with the endogeneity in censored quantile regression , their estimation method involved a high dimensional nonparametric estimation and can be computationally cumbersome .",
    "chernozhukov  _ et  al_.  ( 2014 ) also introduced control variables to account for endogeneity .",
    "they proposed using quantile regression and distribution regression ( chernozhukov  _ et  al_. ,  2013 ) to construct the control variables and extended the estimation method of chernozhukov and hong  ( 2002 ) .    in the bayesian framework , mean",
    "regression models with endogenous variables have garnered a great deal of research attention from both the theoretical and the computational points of view ( _ e.g .  _",
    "rossi  _ et  al_. ,  2005 ; hoogerheide  _ et  al_. ,  2007a ,  2007b ; conely  _ et  al_. ,  2008 ; lopes and polson ,  2014 ) .",
    "however , despite the growing interest in and demand for bayesian quantile regression , the literature on bayesian quantile regression with endogenous variables remains sparse .",
    "lancaster and jun  ( 2010 ) utilised the exponentially tilted empirical likelihood and employed the moment conditions used in chernozhukov and hansen  ( 2006 ) . in the spirit of lee  ( 2007 ) , ogasawara and kobayashi  ( 2015 ) employed a simple parametric model using two asymmetric laplace distributions for panel quantile regression",
    ". however , these methods are only applicable to uncensored data .",
    "furthermore , the model of ogasawara and kobayashi  ( 2015 ) can be restrictive because of the shape limitation of the asymmetric laplace distribution , which can affect the estimates .",
    "indeed , the modelling of the first stage error in this approach remains to be discussed .",
    "based on the foregoing , this study proposes a flexible parametric bayesian endogenous tqr model .",
    "the @xmath0-th quantile regression of interest is modelled parametrically following the usual bayesian quantile regression approach .",
    "following lee  ( 2007 ) , we introduce a control variable such that the conditional quantile of the error term is corrected to be zero and the parameters are correctly estimated . as in the approach of lee  ( 2007 ) , the @xmath1-th quantile of the error term in the regression of the endogenous variable on the exogenous variables , which is often called the first stage regression , is also assumed to be zero .",
    "we discuss the modelling approach for the first stage regression and consider a number of parametric and semiparametric models based on the extensions of ogasawara and kobayashi  ( 2015 ) .",
    "specifically , following wichitaksorn  _ et  al_.  ( 2014 ) and naranjo  _ et  al_.  ( 2015 ) , we employ the first stage regression models based on the asymmetric laplace distribution , skew normal distribution , and asymmetric exponential power distribution , for which the @xmath1-th quantile is always zero and is modelled by the regression function . to introduce more flexibility into the tail behaviour of the models based on the asymmetric laplace and skew normal distributions",
    ", we also consider a semiparametric extension using the dirichlet process mixture of scale parameters as in kottas and krnjaji  ( 2011 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath1 is a priori unknown , while the choice of @xmath1 can affect the estimates . in this study , hence , @xmath1 is treated as a parameter to incorporate uncertainty and is estimated from the data .",
    "the performance of the proposed models is demonstrated in a simulation study under various settings , which is a novel contribution of the present study .",
    "we also illustrate the influence of the prior distributions on the posterior in the cases where valid and weak instruments are used .",
    "the rest of this paper is organised as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : tobit ] introduces the standard bayesian tqr model with a motivating example .",
    "then , section  [ sec : approach ] proposes bayesian tqr models to deal with the endogenous variables .",
    "the mcmc methods adopted to make inferences about the models are also described .",
    "the simulation study under various settings is presented in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "the models are also illustrated by using the real data on the working hours of married women in section  [ sec : real ] .",
    "finally , we conclude in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "suppose that the response variables are observed according to @xmath3 then , consider the @xmath0-th quantile regression model for @xmath4 given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the vector of regressors , @xmath7 is the coefficient parameter , and @xmath8 is the error term whose @xmath0-th quantile is zero .",
    "the @xmath0-th conditional quantile of @xmath9 is modelled as @xmath10 .",
    "the equivariance under the monotone transformation @xmath11 of quantiles implies that the @xmath0-th conditional quantile of @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 the tqr model can be estimated by minimising the sum of asymmetrically weighted absolute errors @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 denotes the indicator function ( powell ,  1986 ) .",
    "the bayesian approach assumes that @xmath17 follows the asymmetric laplace distribution , since minimising ( [ eqn : check ] ) is equivalent to maximising the likelihood function of the asymmetric laplace distribution ( koenker and machado ,  1999 ; chernozhukov and hong ,  2003 ) .",
    "the probability density function of the asymmetric laplace distribution , denoted by @xmath18 , is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the scale parameter and @xmath21 is the shape parameter ( yu and zhang ,  2005 ) .",
    "the mean and variance are given by @xmath22=\\sigma\\frac{1 - 2p}{p(1-p)}$ ] and @xmath23 .",
    "the @xmath0-th quantile of this distribution is zero , @xmath24 .",
    "assuming the prior distributions for the parameters , the parameters are estimated by using the mcmc method ( _ e.g .",
    "_ yu and stander ,  2007 ; kozumi and kobayashi ,  2011 ) .",
    "posterior consistency of bayesian quantile regression based on the asymmetric laplace distribution was shown by sriram  _ et  al_.  ( 2013 ) .",
    "estimates under the standard bayesian tqr model are biased when endogenous variables are included as regressors .",
    "consider a simple motivating example where the dataset was generated from @xmath25 for @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30.\\ ] ] see also chernozhukov  _ et  al_.  ( 2014 ) .",
    "note that @xmath31 expresses the level of endogeneity .",
    "while @xmath32 is an exogenous variable when @xmath33 , @xmath32 is endogenous when @xmath34 . since @xmath35 ,",
    "the model can be rewritten as @xmath36 therefore , the standard model that models the conditional quantile of @xmath9 as @xmath37 produces biased estimates .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig1 ] shows the posterior distributions of @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 for the standard model for @xmath41 obtained by using the method of kozumi and kobayashi  ( 2011 ) .",
    "the vertical lines in the figure indicate the true values . in the case of @xmath33 ,",
    "the posterior distributions are concentrated around the true values . however , in the case of @xmath42 , the posterior distributions are concentrated away from the true values .    , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 using the standard bayesian tobit median regression ]",
    "we propose the following model to deal with the endogenous variables : @xmath43 for @xmath44 , where @xmath6 is the vector of the exogenous variables whose the first element is @xmath45 , @xmath46 is the endogenous variable , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the exogenous variable not included in @xmath6 , which is also called the instrumental variable .",
    "the term @xmath49 in ( [ eqn:2nd ] ) is called the control variable and is introduced to account for endogeneity .",
    "note that @xmath50 indicates @xmath46 is endogenous .",
    "we refer to ( [ eqn:1st ] ) as the first stage regression and to ( [ eqn:2nd ] ) as the second stage regression .",
    "a similar form is found in lopes and polson  ( 2014 ) in the context of the instrumental variable regression for means by using the cholesky - based prior .",
    "following lee  ( 2007 ) , the error term @xmath8 of the standard bayesian tqr is decomposed into the terms @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "it is assumed that relationship ( [ eqn:1st ] ) is specified correctly and the quantile independence of @xmath52 on @xmath53 conditional on @xmath54 : @xmath55 as in lee  ( 2007 ) , we also assume @xmath56 where the @xmath1-th conditional quantile of @xmath54 is zero for some @xmath57 .      we are mainly concerned with modelling the first stage error that satisfies ( [ eqn : alpha ] ) .",
    "a simple and convenient approach is to assume @xmath58 as in ogasawara and kobayashi  ( 2015 ) , since ( [ eqn : alpha ] ) is always satisfied for the asymmetric laplace distribution .",
    "however , the asymmetric laplace distribution has limitations , such as peaky density , restrictive tail behaviour , and skewness .",
    "when a model lacks fit to the data , the estimate of the conditional quantile would be away from the value such that ( [ eqn : alpha ] ) truly holds .",
    "then , assuming @xmath54 is homoskedastic , the estimate of the intercept , @xmath59 , may be biased as well .",
    "consequently , the estimate of @xmath60 would be affected through the introduced term @xmath51 .",
    "when @xmath54 is heteroskedastic , the entire coefficient vector would be affected .",
    "therefore , we consider some alternative models for the first stage error distribution .",
    "recently , wichitaksorn  _ et  al_.  ( 2014 ) considered a class of parametric distributions with a quantile constraint of the form ( [ eqn : alpha ] ) , including the asymmetric laplace distribution , and applied them in the context of quantile modelling .",
    "furthermore , zhu and zinde - walsh  ( 2009 ) , zhu and galbraith  ( 2011 ) , and naranjo  _ et  al_.  ( 2015 ) considered a flexible parametric distribution with the quantile constraint . based on these studies , we also consider the following two distributions to model the first stage error .",
    "first , we consider the skew normal distribution denoted by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the scale parameter and @xmath57 is the shape parameter .",
    "the probability density function is given by @xmath63 when @xmath64 , the distribution reduces to @xmath65 .",
    "the mean and variance are given by @xmath66=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\phi}{2\\pi}}\\frac{1 - 2\\alpha}{\\alpha(1-\\alpha)}$ ] and @xmath67 ( see wichitaksorn  _ et  al_. ,  2014 ) .",
    "when the actual error distribution is close to the normal distribution , this distribution would lead to better performance than the asymmetric laplace distribution .",
    "however , just as the asymmetric laplace distribution , the skewness and the quantile level of the mode are controlled by the single parameter @xmath1 .",
    "second , we consider the asymmetric exponential power distribution treated by zhu and zinde - walsh  ( 2009 ) , zhu and galbraith  ( 2011 ) , and naranjo  _ et  al_.  ( 2015 ) .",
    "the probability density function of the asymmetric exponential power distribution , denoted by @xmath68 , is given by @xmath69 where @xmath62 is the scale parameter , @xmath57 is the skewness parameter , @xmath70 is the shape parameter for the left tail , and @xmath71 is the shape parameter for the right tail . after some reparameterisation",
    ", the distribution reduces to the asymmetric laplace distribution when @xmath72 and to the skew normal distribution when @xmath73 .",
    "the tails of the asymmetric exponential power distribution are controlled separately by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively , and the overall skewness is controlled by @xmath1 . although the distribution is more flexible than the above two distributions , the posterior computation using mcmc would be inefficient , because it includes two additional shape parameters and it has no convenient mixture representation , apart from the mixture of uniforms that is inefficient , to facilitate an efficient mcmc algorithm .",
    "the computational efficiency is also compared in section  [ sec : sim ] .",
    "in addition to the three parametric models , we also consider the semiparametric extension of the models based on the asymmetric laplace and skew normal distributions to achieve both flexibility and computational efficiency .",
    "more specifically , the following two models using the dirichlet process mixtures of scales are considered : @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the dirichlet process with the precision parameter @xmath78 and the base measure @xmath79 .",
    "for both models , we set @xmath80 as it is computationally convenient .",
    "while those mixture models have the same limitation as the parametric versions in terms of skewness , they extend the tail behaviour of the error distribution preserving ( [ eqn : alpha ] ) ( kottas and krnjaji ,  2009 ) .",
    "hereafter , the models with the asymmetric laplace , skew normal , and asymmetric exponential power first stage errors are respectively denoted by al , sn , and aep , and those with the dirichlet process mixtures are denoted by aldp and sndp .",
    "we must take care when selecting the @xmath1 value in ( [ eqn : alpha ] ) , as it is a part of the model specification and can thus affect the estimates ( lee ,  2007 ) .",
    "we treat @xmath1 as a parameter and estimate its value along with the other parameters . since @xmath1 determines the quantile level of the mode for all models considered here , our approach to modelling the first stage regression can also be regarded as a kind of mode regression ( see wichitaksorn  _ et  al_. ,  2014 ) .    to gain further flexibility , we might extend the model through a fully nonparametric mixture . several semiparametric models in the context of bayesian quantile regression with exogenous variables",
    "have been proposed by kottas and gelfand  ( 2001 ) , kottas and krnjaji  ( 2009 ) , and reich  _ et  al_.  ( 2010 ) .",
    "for example , kottas and krnjaji  ( 2009 ) considered the nonparametric mixture of uniform distributions for any unimodal density on the real line with the quantile restriction at the mode using the dirichlet process mixture ( see also kottas and gelfand ,  2001 ) . in the more flexible model proposed by reich",
    "_ et  al_.  ( 2010 ) , the mode of the error distribution does not have to coincide with zero .",
    "this is achieved by using a nonparametric mixture of the quantile - restricted two - component mixtures of normal distributions .",
    "however , their approaches are not directly applicable in the present context where the value of @xmath1 is estimated . if we were to estimate the quantile level for which the quantile restriction holds , the computation under the former model is expected to be extremely inefficient and unstable as the model involves many indicator functions , and @xmath1 and the intercept would be highly correlated .",
    "the intercept would not be identifiable in the latter model .",
    "we could further extend the model to account for heteroskedasticity such that @xmath81 for @xmath44 , where @xmath82 for all @xmath83 and the first element of @xmath84 is fixed to one ( _ e.g .",
    "_ reich ,  2010 ) . in this case , the @xmath1-th quantile of @xmath32 is given by @xmath85 as in the usual quantile regression .",
    "however , since the first stage regression model is built based on ( [ eqn : alpha ] ) , models ( [ eqn:1st ] ) and ( [ eqn : hetero ] ) would produce identical estimates .",
    "we next turn to the model of the new second stage error , @xmath52 , in ( [ eqn:2nd ] ) . since the @xmath0-th conditional quantile of @xmath52 is now zero",
    ", we assume that @xmath86 as in the standard bayesian quantile regression approach .",
    "we utilise the location scale mixture of normals representation for the asymmetric laplace distribution to facilitate an efficient mcmc method following kozumi and kobayashi  ( 2011 ) ( see also kotz  _ et  al_. ,  2001 ) .",
    "the model is expressed in the hierarchical form given by @xmath87 for @xmath44 , where @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 denotes the exponential distribution with mean @xmath91 , and @xmath92      the coefficient parameter @xmath93 is common to all first stage regression specifications .",
    "first , we assume the normal prior for @xmath93 , since it is computationally convenient for the al , sn , aldp , and sndp models .",
    "since we do not have information on the coefficient values , the variances are set such that the prior distributions are relatively diffuse .",
    "our default choice is @xmath94 . for the scale parameters , @xmath95 for the al , sn , and aep distributions ,",
    "a relatively diffuse inverse gamma distribution is assumed and the default choice is set to @xmath96 . for aep ,",
    "we assume @xmath97 , where @xmath98 denotes the normal distribution with the mean @xmath99 and variance @xmath100 truncated on the interval @xmath101 .",
    "a similar prior specification is found in naranjo  _ et  al_.  ( 2015 ) . for all models , @xmath102 is assumed .    for the semiparametric models , we need to specify the parameters of the inverse gamma base measure .",
    "assuming that the data have been rescaled , @xmath103 and @xmath104 are chosen such that the variance of @xmath54 takes values between @xmath105 and @xmath106 with high probability ( _ e.g .",
    "_ ishwaran and james ,  2002 ) .",
    "our default choice is @xmath107 and @xmath108 for aldp and @xmath109 for sndp . under this choice ,",
    "when @xmath64 for aldp , @xmath110 as @xmath111 .",
    "similarly , when @xmath112 , @xmath113 . for sndp , @xmath114 when @xmath64 and @xmath115 when @xmath112 .",
    "for the precision parameter of the dirichlet process , @xmath116 , we assume @xmath117 such that both small and large values for @xmath116 , hence the number of clusters , are allowed .    for the coefficient parameters in the second stage , @xmath7 and @xmath118",
    ", we also assume relatively diffuse normal distributions .",
    "our default choice of prior is @xmath119 .",
    "similar to @xmath95 in the parametric first stage , we assume an inverse gamma prior for the scale of the al pseudo likelihood .",
    "our default choice is @xmath96 .",
    "the parameter @xmath120 accounts for the endogeneity and we need to take care in prior elicitation . when the data follow the bivariate normal distribution , as in the motivating example ( [ eqn : example ] ) , @xmath120 is equal to @xmath121 , where @xmath31 is the correlation coefficient and @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the standard deviations of the first and second stage errors , respectively . in this case , we may follow lopes and polson  ( 2014 ) to determine the variance of the normal prior implied from an inverse wishart prior for the covariance matrix . however , we do not limit ourselves to normal data as the quantile regression approach is suitable for heteroskedastic and non - normal data , and the non - normal models are used in the first stage . in the literature on bayesian non - normal selection models , the prior distribution of @xmath120 is normal typically with a very small variance , such as @xmath124 ( _ e.g .  _",
    "munkin and trivedi ,  2003 , 2008 ; deb  _ et  al_. ,  2006 ) .",
    "on the other hand , we use a more diffused prior to reflect our ignorance about @xmath120 and set our default choice of prior to be @xmath125 . when the instrument is weak , it is expected that our quantile regression models face the problem of prior sensitivity and that the posterior distributions exhibit sharp behaviour , as in the case of the bayesian instrumental variable regression model .",
    "section  [ sec : sim ] considers the alternative choices of the hyperparameters to study the prior sensitivity .",
    "the proposed models are estimated by using the mcmc method based on the gibbs sampler .",
    "we describe the gibbs sampler for the semiparametric models with aldp and sndp , which is an extension of the gibbs sampler described in kozumi and kobayashi  ( 2011 ) and ogasawara and kobayashi  ( 2015 ) .",
    "the algorithms for the al and sn models can be obtained straightforwardly .",
    "we also mention the algorithm for the aep model .",
    "the variables involved in the dirichlet process are sampled by using the retrospective sampler ( papaspiliopoulos and roberts ,  2008 ) and the slice sampler ( walker ,  2007 ) .",
    "first , we introduce @xmath126 and @xmath127 , such that @xmath128 .",
    "then , as in walker  ( 2007 ) , the gibbs sampler is constructed by working on the following joint densities @xmath129 where @xmath130 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 denotes the beta distribution with the parameters @xmath116 and @xmath134 ( sethuraman ,  1994 ) .",

    "therefore , we employ the adaptive random walk mh algorithm . although naranjo  _ et  al_.

    "the performance of the models is compared by considering the various settings for @xmath54 , while the distributions of @xmath52 are kept relatively simple in order that the true values of the quantile regression coefficients are tractable .",

    "the error terms follow the bivariate normal distribution as in the motivating example in section  [ sec : tobit ] .",
    "setting  2 considers the fat tailed first stage regression . setting  3",
    "considers a more difficult situation where the first stage error is fat tailed and skewed .",
    "setting  4 replaces the first stage error of setting  1 with the heteroskedastic error with respect to the instrument .",
    "setting  5 is also a challenging situation where the first stage error is fat tailed , skewed , and heteroskedastic . in settings  3 and 5 , the location parameters of the first stage error distributions are set such that the mode of @xmath54 is zero and the quantile level of the mode is @xmath216 .",
    "the average censoring rates for the settings are around @xmath217 . for each setting , the data are replicated @xmath218 times .",
    "we first estimated the proposed models under the default prior specifications ( see section  [ sec : prior ] ) for @xmath219 and @xmath220 by running the mcmc for @xmath221 iterations and discarding the first @xmath222 draws as the burn - in period .",
    "the standard bayesian tqr model was also estimated .",
    "the bias and root mean squared error ( rmse ) of the parameters were computed over the @xmath218 replications . to assess the efficiency of the mcmc algorithm",
    ", we also recorded the inefficiency factor , which was defined as a ratio of the numerical variance of the sample mean of the markov chain to the variance of the independence draws ( chib ,  2001 ) .",
    "table  [ tab : default ] presents the biases , rmses , and median inefficiency factors for the parameters over the @xmath218 replications .",
    "first , we examined the inefficiency factors .",
    "overall , our sampling algorithms appear to be efficient , especially for al , sn , aldp , and sndp .",
    "the table shows that the inefficiency factors for al , sn , aldp , and sndp are reasonably small for @xmath223 , @xmath118 , @xmath120 , @xmath224 , and @xmath225 . since @xmath1 and @xmath59 determine the quantile level of the mode and location of the mode , respectively , the mcmc sample exhibits correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath59 and this results in higher inefficiency factors for them .",
    "hence , the inefficiency factors for @xmath226 tend to be higher than those for the other parameters .",
    "this pattern is more profound in the case of aep where the inefficiency factors for @xmath1 , @xmath59 , and @xmath226 are quite high . since the additional shape parameters in aep free up the role of @xmath1 , the mcmc sample exhibits higher correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath59 .",
    "furthermore , the inefficiency factors for the other parameters for aep are also higher than those for the other endogenous models .",
    "next , we turn to the performance of the models .",
    "as expected , tqr produces biased estimates in all cases .",
    "the rmses for the proposed endogenous models are generally larger for @xmath219 , which is below the censoring point , than for @xmath41 .",
    "the al and aldp models result in similar performance .",
    "the aep model shows the largest rmses for @xmath59 and @xmath226 among the proposed models for all cases .",
    "combined with the high inefficiency factors for those parameters , the convergence of the mcmc algorithm for aep may be difficult to ensure in the given simulation setting .",
    "this finding suggests a considerable practical limitation and , thus , aep will not be considered henceforth .",
    "the same limitation applies to the potentially more flexible nonparametric models discussed in section  [ sec:1st ] .",
    "table  [ tab : default ] also shows that the estimation of the first stage regression can influence the second stage parameters .",
    "for example , in setting  1 , the rmses for @xmath59 for sn and sndp are smaller than those for al and aldp , as the true model is the normal and thus sn and sndp produce smaller rmses for @xmath226 . similarly , in setting  4 ,",
    "the rmses for @xmath226 for sn and sndp are smaller than those for al and aldp .",
    "in addition , the heteroskedasticity in the first stage influences the performance of the slope parameters , resulting in slightly smaller rmses for @xmath223 for sn and sndp than for al and aldp .",
    "however , the performance of the sn model becomes worse when the first stage error is fat tailed , since the skew normal distribution can not accommodate a fat tailed distribution .",
    "while the results in setting  2 are somewhat comparable across the models , the table shows that sn results in larger biases and rmses in setting  3 and , especially , setting  5 . in setting  3 ,",
    "sn results in larger rmses for @xmath226 than for al , aldp , and sndp . in setting  5 ,",
    "given the heteroskedasticity of the first stage , the biases and rmses for the intercept and slope parameters for sn are larger than those for al , aldp , and sndp .",
    "on the other hand , compared with sn , the semiparametric sndp model is able to cope with fat tailed errors and this produces results comparable with those for al and aldp .    while the models result in reasonable overall performance , the results for settings  3 and 5 also illustrate the limitation of our modelling approach to some extent . in setting  3 , the models exhibit some bias in @xmath226 because of the lack of fit in the first stage .",
    "this lack of fit , which is represented by the bias for @xmath59 , is reflected in the bias for @xmath226 .",
    "the entire coefficient vector may be influenced by this lack of fit in the first stage in the presence of heteroskedasticity as in setting  5 .",
    "the lack of fit in the first stage is also indicated by the biases in @xmath1 .",
    "this finding implies that an inflexible first stage model can fail to estimate the true quantile such that ( [ eqn : alpha ] ) holds and that choosing the value of @xmath1 a priori could lead to biased estimates ( see the discussion in section  [ sec:1st ] ) .      for comparison purposes ,",
    "we consider two alternative specifications for the inverse gamma base measure for the semiparametric models .",
    "the following slightly less diffuse settings than the default are considered . for aldp , we consider @xmath227 such that @xmath228 and @xmath229 such that @xmath230 when @xmath64 . for sndp",

    "next , the two alternative prior specifications for @xmath120 , @xmath91 , and @xmath95 are considered to study the prior sensitivity .",
    "the first alternative specification considers the more diffuse priors given by @xmath235 , @xmath236 , and @xmath237 . the second alternative specification is the even more diffuse setting given by @xmath238 , @xmath239 , and @xmath240 .",

    "these findings thus confirm the robustness of the results with respect to the choice of base measures and prior distributions provided that a valid instrument is available . in the context of mean regression models ,",

    "<S> is introduced . </S>",
    "<S> then , the residual of this regression model is included in the @xmath0-th quantile regression model in such a way that the @xmath0-th conditional quantile of the new error term is zero . </S>",
    "<S> the error distribution of the first stage regression is modelled around the zero @xmath1-th quantile assumption by using parametric and semiparametric approaches . </S>",
    "<S> since the value of @xmath1 is a priori unknown , it is treated as an additional parameter and is estimated from the data . </S>",
