    "m emission in blue and the mips-_spitzer _ 24 @xmath2 m emission is shown in green .",
    "the objects analysed in this work are indicated . the arc feature in n22 and almost the whole interior of g18.149 - 0.283",
    "are saturated in 24 @xmath2m.,width=362 ]    nowadays it is well known that massive stars in our galaxy are born predominantly within the dense cores of giant molecular clouds ( for a thorough discussion of the star - formation theories see @xcite ) .",
    "they usually form and evolve in clusters , hence it is expectable to observe several hii regions in different evolutionary stages and probably also supernova remnants ( snrs ) in a same galactic neighborhood .",
    "some examples of this spatial coincidence are the field toward w28 , with several snrs and hii regions ( e.g. @xcite ) , the snr w44 and the hii region g034.8 - 0.7 @xcite , the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) star candidate g24.73 + 0.69 , some hii regions and the snr g24.7 + 0.6 @xcite .",
    "moreover , it is usually observed large amounts of molecular gas in the surroundings of hii regions and snrs .",
    "the shock and ionization fronts from these objects , which compress and sweep up the molecular gas , can trigger the formation of a new generation of massive stars .",
    "this has been extensively probed towards the borders of hii regions ( e.g. @xcite ) where processes such as `` collect and collapse '' @xcite and/or radiative driven implosion @xcite can be taking place .    the goal of this work is to provide observational evidence supporting that massive stars usually born in clusters from material of the same molecular cloud , which then produce , along their evolution , neighboring hii regions , interstellar bubbles and snrs that can interact with the parental cloud . to perform this",
    "we select a very rich region in which lie the snr g18.1 - 0.1 and several hii regions , two of them catalogued as infrared dust bubbles by @xcite . in section [ present ] , we describe the studied hii region / snr complex , section [ ism ] presents an analysis of the interstellar medium ( ism ) around these sources , in section [ obstars ] we present an optical spectroscopic search for ob - type stars ( the hii regions exciting star candidates ) and an analysis of two x - ray point sources , section [ larger ] presents a larger scale ism study around the complex , and finally section [ summ ] summarizes the obtained results .",
    "in figure [ presentfig ] we present the 22  @xmath1 22  region where the hii region / snr complex lies in a colour composite image as seen in the _ spitzer_-irac 8 @xmath2 m emission ( blue ) , the radio continuum emission at 20 cm ( red ) , and the the _ spitzer_-mipsgal emission at 24 @xmath2 m ( green ) .",
    "we used the mosaicked image from the galactic legacy infrared mid - plane survey extraordinaire ( glimpse ) in the _",
    "spitzer_-irac band at 8 @xmath2 m which has an angular resolution of @xmath319 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "mipsgal is a survey of the same region as glimpse , using mips instrument ( 24 and 70 @xmath2 m ) on _ spitzer _ @xcite .",
    "the mipsgal resolution at 24 @xmath2 m is 6 .",
    "the radio continuum data at 20 cm , with a fwhm synthesized beam of about 5 , was extracted from the new gps of the multi - array galactic plane imaging survey @xcite which was conducted using the very large array ( vla ) . in what follows",
    "we describe each object based on the information that appears in the literature .",
    "snr g18.1 - 0.1 or g18.16 - 0.16 @xcite is a poor studied supernova remnant that was firstly observed at 57.5 mhz by @xcite , who identified it as snr g18.1 - 0.2 .",
    "the author also mentions the presence of the source sharpless 2 - 53 @xcite , which is related to the hii regions complex composed by n21 , n22 and g018.149 - 00.283 as seen in figure [ presentfig ] .",
    "based on the distance estimated for the hii regions complex of 4.5 kpc @xcite , @xcite suggests this value as the minimum kinematic distance for the snr .",
    "later , the snr g18.1 - 0.1 was associated with the x - ray source axj182435 - 1311 , which was observed with asca @xcite .",
    "more recently , this shell snr was identified in the very large array survey of the galactic plane at 90 cm by @xcite , reporting fluxes of 7.6 , 3.9 , and 3.0 jy at 90 , 20 , and 11 cm , respectively .",
    "they derived an spectral index of @xmath4 using the emission at 90 and 20 cm , and @xmath5 using the 90 and 11 cm data .",
    "@xcite using glimpse data , catalogued almost 600 infrared dust bubbles : full or partial rings bordered by a photodissociation region ( pdr ) , seen mainly at 8 @xmath2 m , which usually encloses ionized gas and hot dust observed at 24 @xmath2 m .",
    "most of these bubbles are hii regions as is the case of bubbles n21 and n22 displayed in figure [ presentfig ] .",
    "the bubble n22 , g18.259 - 0.307 hii region @xcite , has a recombination line velocity of v@xmath6 @xmath7 , and is located at @xmath3 4.1 kpc .",
    "the interstellar medium around n22 was very recently investigated by @xcite , finding some evidence of triggered star formation .",
    "the bubble n21 is not catalogued in @xcite but it appears as the hii region g018.20 - 00.40 in @xcite with a systemic velocity of v@xmath6 @xmath8 .",
    "the spectral resolutions in @xcite and @xcite are 2.5  and between 2 and 4 , respectively .",
    "@xcite identified 21 yso candidates around n21 , and based on a sed fitting to numerical hot stellar photosphere models , they suggested some stars to be the possible exciting sources of this hii region . according to @xcite , who analysed a sample of 291 galactic hii regions with the aim of resolving the distance ambiguity ,",
    "n21 is related to the source called c18.19 - 0.40 with a resolved distance d@xmath93.6 kpc , and n22 to c18.26 - 0.30 with d@xmath94.0 kpc .",
    "hii region g018.149 - 00.283 is not catalogued as an infrared dust bubble , and according to @xcite , has a recombination line velocity of v@xmath6 @xmath10 and is located at the distance of @xmath3 4.1 kpc .",
    "this is in agreement with the distance catalogued for u18.15 - 0.28 , the source related to this hii region in @xcite      the source that is superimposed over the eastern border of the snr is the hii region g18.197 - 00.181 @xcite , which has a systemic velocity v@xmath6 @xmath11 .",
    "this hii region is related to c18.20 - 0.18 in @xcite , whose distance ( d@xmath93.7 or 12.4 kpc ) is not resolved because it presents a discrepancy between the used methods to resolve the ambiguity .      in figure [ presentfig ] , based on the morphology of the ir and radio continuum emission , we indicated another possible hii region ( it appears with an interrogation mark in the figure ) , which was not found in any catalogue .",
    "this source has a pdr visible in the 8 @xmath2 m band , which encloses ionized gas observed at 20 cm and hot dust observed at 24 @xmath2 m , typical characteristics of hii regions ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this case",
    "it can be appreciated two peaks at 24 @xmath2 m , one toward the center and the other almost in a border of this possible hii region .",
    "according to the coordinates , this object should be hii region g18.237 - 0.240 .    in order to summarize , table [ sources ]",
    "presents the sources , their galactic coordinates , the radius in the case of the snr , the average radius for the hii regions and the linear sizes .",
    "the snr radius was extracted from @xcite , while the average radius of bubbles n21 and n22 from @xcite . in the case of g018.149 - 00.283 , g18.197 - 00.181 and the possible unknown hii region , the average radius was estimated as was done by @xcite for the infrared dust bubbles .",
    "the linear size is the spatial diameter of the sources by assuming a distance of 4 kpc .",
    ".analysed sources . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this section we analyse the hii region / snr complex surroudings in a larger spatial scale .",
    "a detailed inspection of the whole data cube at larger scale reveals that the hii region / snr complex lies in a border of a big molecular shell that peaks in the velocity interval of 5155 . by inspecting the mid - ir emission in this large scale area we did not find any possible counterpart to this molecular shell .",
    "figure [ large ] presents the j=10 emission of a large region of about 13 @xmath1 08 integrated between 51 and 55 .",
    "it is very interesting to note that the hii region / snr complex is located southward a very likely molecular shell with an elliptical shape with semi - axes of 30@xmath112 , centered at @xmath12 18185 , and @xmath130104 . assuming a distance of 4 kpc , the molecular shell has an extension of about 70 pc @xmath1 28 pc .",
    "following the standard nomenclature for galactic shells , we designate this new structure as gsh 18.2 - 0.1 + 53 . along the mentioned velocity range , the co shell is well defined as a large structure , although , as in many other shells , the typical behaviour of an expanding structure ( i.e. a ring that starts as a cap , reaches its greatest angular dimension at the systemic velocity and then shrinks back to a cap ) is not completely observed .",
    "figure [ large ] also shows that the shell is composed of several molecular condensations among which are those associated with the hii region / snr complex .",
    "following the same assumptions and equations as section [ ism ] we derive an average h@xmath14 column density for the whole molecular shell . assuming a constant t@xmath15 = 20 k over the shell and a @xmath16  , we obtain n(h@xmath17 ) @xmath3 5 @xmath18 @xmath19 .",
    "using equation ( [ eq4 ] ) and performing the summation over all the observed positions within the 1.2 k contour level ( which define the shell boundary , see figure [ large ] ) we obtain a total molecular mass of about 2 @xmath20 .",
    "following @xcite , we estimate the kinetic energy stored in the shell and its age using @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respetively , in which is considered a simple model that describes the expansion of a shell created by a continuous injection of mechanical energy , where @xmath23 is the effective radius .",
    "table [ para ] summarizes the main physical parameters of gsh 18.2 - 0.1 + 53 .",
    "the origin of most of these expanding structures would be related to the action of massive stars ( ob - type stars ) and their descendants ( wr stars ) , which strongly disturb the environment that surrounds them , first by the high rate of ionizing photons and strong winds , and subsequently at the end of their lives , when they explode as supernovae . in this context , we wonder for the origin of gsh 18.2 - 0.1 + 53 .",
    "we have not found any ob star catalogued toward the interior of the shell .",
    "but of course we can not discard that this shell has been originated by the action of massive stars .",
    "our x - ray analysis suggests that sx1 , which lies in the interior of the molecular shell , can be an o - type star , probably one of the responsibles , together with other undetected ob - type stars and even the snr progenitor , in generate the shell . regarding to a snr origin we consider two possible scenarios : i ) the contribution of the snr g18.1 - 0.1 , and ii ) the action of an ancient snr not observed at the present day .",
    "given that the effective action of snr g18.1 - 0.1 is limited to the borders defined by the radio continuum shell , and considering that typical ages for snrs are at most 10@xmath24 yrs , we discard that g18.1 - 0.1 has originated the big shell by itself .",
    "however , as mentioned above , its massive progenitor could have contributed to generate it . by the other hand ,",
    "considering the scenario where the origin of gsh 18.2 - 0.1 + 53 is attributed to an ancient snr that would have injected to the ism a mechanical energy of about @xmath25 erg , from which the shell still preserves about 1% of that energy , it could be a similar case as was proposed for the surroundings of the snr g349.7 + 0.2 @xcite . in that case",
    "it was found that the snr , some iras sources and an uchii region lie in a border of an extended molecular shell , suggested to be the fossil remains of an ancient sn explosion . summarizing , the origin of gsh 18.2 - 0.1 + 53 still remains uncertain and it deserves a deeper study , e.g. new observations toward its interior in order to look for ob - type stars .",
    "the snr g18.1 - 0.1 is located , along the plane of the sky , close to several hii regions ( infrared dust bubbles n21 and n22 , and the hii regions g018.149 - 00.283 and g18.197 - 00.181 ) .",
    "taking into account the catalogued distances and/or systemic velocities of these estructures , and our analysis of the molecular gas related to them , we suggest that all of these objects belong to a same complex at a distance of about 4 kpc .",
    "this could be a clear observational evidence supporting that massive stars born predominantly within dense cores of giant molecular clouds and evolve in clusters , which can generates several neighboring hii regions and snrs .",
    "the main results of this work can be summarised as follows : + ( 1 ) analysing the @xmath0co j=10 emission toward the hii region / snr complex we found several molecular structures very likely related to the sources within the velocity range between 39 and 59 .",
    "the molecular gas morphology suggests that it is very likely being swept and shaped by the expansion of the hii regions , mainly by the infrared dust bubbles n21 and n22 , and the hii region g018.149 - 00.283 .",
    "we obtained a molecular mass for the whole structure related to the complex of about @xmath26 .",
    "we estimated a density of about @xmath27 @xmath28 for the densest portion of this molecular structre .",
    "\\(2 ) using spectroscopic optical observations obtained with the 2.15 m telescope at casleo , argentina , we searched for ob - type stars in order to look for sources responsible of ionizing the gas in the hii regions .",
    "we discovered three o - type stars verly likely exciting the bubbles n21 and n22 , and an uncatalogued hii region northward bubble n22 , respectively .",
    "thus , we confirm the presence of an unknown hii region . additionally , we discovered four b0 - 5 stars , one toward the bubble n22 and the others within the hii region g018.149 - 00.283 .",
    "\\(3 ) taking into account that hot massive stars usually are x - ray emmiters , we looked for x - ray point sources in the chandra source catalog .",
    "we found two sources , one of them coincides with the above mentioned star that is exciting the uncatalogued hii region . estimating an upper limit for its x - ray emission level we can only suggest that it may be an o - type star . on the other side",
    ", the x - ray analysis of the other source , which lies over the snr shell , strongly suggests that it is an early o - type star ( o3-o5 ) .",
    "\\(4 ) by inspecting the ism surrounding the hii region / snr complex in a large scale , we discovered a big molecular shell peaking between 51 and 55 . assuming a distance of 4 kpc",
    ", this shell has an extension of about 70 pc @xmath1 28 pc , and the analysed hii region / snr complex appears to be located in its southern border .",
