    "a brain - computer interface ( bci ) is capable of providing a speller for disabled people with conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) .",
    "although the currently successful visual modality may provide a fast bci speller , patients at an advanced stage who are in a locked  in state can not use the modality because they lose all intentional muscle control , including even blinking and movements of the eyes .",
    "an auditory bci may be an alternative method because it does not require good eyesight .",
    "however , the modality is not as precise as the visual .",
    "we propose an alternative method to extend the previously published spatial auditory bci ( sabci ) paradigm  @xcite by making use of a hrir for virtual sound image spatialization with headphone  based sound reproduction .",
    "our research goal is a virtual spatial auditory bci using hrir  based spatialized cues in the part of the non  invasive , stimulus  driven , auditory modality which does not require long  term training .",
    "experiments were conducted to reproduce and provide a comparison with previously reported vector  based amplitude panning ( vbap)based spatial auditory experiments  @xcite .",
    "the more precise hrir  based spatial auditory bci stimulus reproduction was used to simplify previously reported real sound sources generated with surround sound loudspeakers  @xcite .",
    "hrir appends interaural intensity differences ( iid ) , interaural time differences ( it d ) , and spectral modifications to create the spatial stimuli , while vbap appends only iid .",
    "hrir allows for more precise and fully spatial virtual sound image positioning , even without utilizing the user s owner hrir measurements  @xcite .",
    "the next section of this paper describes the experiment set  up and the hrir  based sabci paradigm , together with eeg signal acquisition , pre  processing and classification steps . in the third section , the event related potentials ( erp ) , and especially the @xmath0 response latencies are described , with a classification and discussion of the hrir  based sabci paradigm information transfer rate ( itr ) results , including a comparison with the conventional method .",
    "finally , the conclusions and future research directions are indicated .",
    "all of the experiments were performed at the life science center of tara , university of tsukuba , japan .",
    "five paid bci - naive users participated in the experiments .",
    "the average age of the users was @xmath1 years ( standard deviation @xmath2 years ; five females ) .",
    "the psychophysical and online eeg bci experiments were conducted in accordance with _ the world medical association declaration of helsinki - ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects_. the experiment procedures were approved and designed in agreement with the ethical committee guidelines of the faculty of engineering , information and systems at the university of tsukuba , japan . five japanese vowels ( a , i , u , e , o ) were used in this experiment .",
    "the vowels were taken from a sound dataset of female voices  @xcite .",
    "the monaural sounds were spatialized using the public domain cipic hrtf database provided by the university of california , davis  @xcite .",
    "each japanese vowel was set on a horizontal plane at azimuth locations of @xmath3,@xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 for the vowels _ a , i , u , e , o _ , respectively .",
    "the psychophysical experiments were conducted to investigate the response time and recognition accuracy .",
    "the users were instructed to respond by pressing the button as soon as possible after they perceived the _ target _ stimulus , as in a classical oddball paradigm  @xcite . in a single experiment session ,",
    "@xmath8  _ targets _ and @xmath9  _ non - targets _ were presented .",
    "an online eeg experiment was conducted to investigate the p300 response with bci  naive users .",
    "the brain signals were collected with a biosignal amplifier system by g.tec medical engineering gmbh , austria .",
    "the eeg signals were captured by sixteen active gel  based electrodes attached to the following head locations _ cz , pz , p3 , p4 , cp5 , cp6 , p1 , p2 , poz , c1 , c2 , fc1 , fc2 , _ and _ fcz _ , as in the extended @xmath10 international system  @xcite .",
    "the ground electrode was attached on the forehead at the _ fpz _ location , and the reference on the user s left earlobe .",
    "bci2000 software was used for the sabci experiments to present stimuli and display online classification results .",
    "a single experiment was comprised of five sessions which contained @xmath11  _ target _ and @xmath12  _ non - target _ stimuli .",
    "the stimulus duration was set to @xmath13  ms , the interstimulus interval ( isi ) to @xmath14  ms , and brain signals were averaged @xmath11  times for each vowel classification .",
    "the eeg sampling rate was set to @xmath15  hz , and a @xmath16  hz notch filter to remove electric power line interference was applied in a rejection band of @xmath17  hz .",
    "the band pass filter was set with @xmath18  hz and @xmath19  hz cut - off frequencies .",
    "the acquired eeg brain signals were classified online by the bci2000 application using a stepwise linear discriminant analysis ( swlda ) classifier with features drawn from the @xmath20  ms erp interval .",
    "this section presents and discusses results obtained from the psychophysical and eeg experiments conducted with five users , as described in the previous section . in the psychophysical experiment ,",
    "the accuracy rates for all stimuli were above @xmath21 .",
    "the majority of responses were concentrated at the @xmath22  ms latency .",
    "there were no significant differences in the response times between the target stimuli as tested by anova @xmath23 .",
    "the results of the eeg experiment are depicted in figure  [ fig : eegauc2 ] .",
    "the left panel shows the grand mean averaged erp results at four representative electrodes .",
    "the centre panel provides the results as scalp topographies at the maximum and minimum area under curve ( auc ) of a receiver operating with characteristic values  @xcite for _ target _ vs. _ non  target _ latencies .",
    "it also demonstrates the eeg electrode positions used in the experiments .",
    "the top right panel indicates the averaged erp responses of all electrodes to the _ target _ , and the second panel shows responses to the _ non  target _ stimuli .",
    "the bottom panel indicates the auc of _ target _ versus _ non - target _ responses , clearly confirming the usability of @xmath24  ms latencies for the subsequent classification .",
    "table  [ tab : eeg2 ] presents the classification accuracies of the p300 responses as obtained with the swlda classifier and the itr scores .",
    "the average score was obtained as a mean value calculated from @xmath25  sessions ( the training session was not included in the accuracies calculation ) .",
    "the itr is a major comparison measure  @xcite among the bci paradigms .",
    "all five users scored above the five vowel sequences spelling chance levels of @xmath26 .",
    "there was one user who achieved @xmath27 accuracy , which was the best in the experiments reported .",
    "we also compared the itr scores with a vbap  based spatial auditory bci , which is regarded as a conventional method  @xcite .",
    "the vbap experiment was conducted in @xmath28  sessions and with @xmath29  bci  naive users in @xcite .",
    "the electrode positions were the same as in our current experiments .",
    "the sound stimuli were presented with small ear  fitting headphones in both the modalities .",
    "the isi was set to @xmath30  ms in the vbap experiment , and to @xmath14  ms in the hrir experiment . in the vbap modality ,",
    "the average itr score was @xmath31  bit / min and the best was @xmath32  bit / min . in the hrir modality , the average itr was @xmath33  bit / min and the best was @xmath34  bit / min .",
    "the itr scores of the hrir experiment were recalculated for @xmath28  sessions , the same as for the vbap experiment .",
    "hrir based modality produced better results than the vbap based modality for both the average and the best score .",
    "the eeg results presented confirm the p300 responses of bci  naive users .",
    "the mean accuracy was not very good owing to the short isi , but the accuracy tends to improve when the number of session increases . therefore , more training may be necessary for bci  naive users .",
    "the itr scores were higher compared with our previous study using hrir stimuli , and also compared with the previously reported vbap  based spatial auditory bci .",
    "nevertheless , the current study is not able to compete with the faster visual bci spellers .",
    "furthermore , it is necessary to improve the itr for a more comfortable spelling .",
    "we plan to continue research with larger numbers of sound stimuli , a better suited isi , and more complex spatial sound patterns .",
