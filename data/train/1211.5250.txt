    "the literature on those accretion disk systems where the gas exhibits keplerian motion @xmath1 ( here @xmath2 is the angular velocity of the gas , @xmath3 denotes the cylindrical radius , and @xmath4 is a constant ) brings a confusing message .",
    "usually the velocity of rotation of such disks is understood to be dominated by a heavy central mass @xmath5 , that is the strictly keplerian equality @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the gravitational constant , holds true .",
    "the disk is assumed to be light .",
    "the analysis of the massive black hole in the masing nucleus of ngc 4258 exemplifies this interpretation @xcite ( interestingly , modelling of this system confirms that the disk is light @xcite ) . on the other hand , there are sporadic observations in the literature that even systems with massive disks can conform to the keplerian rotation curve @xcite . in such a case the central mass can not be deduced solely from the keplerian frequency .",
    "quite recently hur et al .",
    "@xcite investigated thin dust disks and , assuming a monomial density profile , arrived to a conclusion that the rotational keplerian velocity gives only information on the enclosed mass of the system , i.e. , a sum of the central mass @xmath5 and the mass of the disk @xmath8",
    ".    in this paper we deal with self - gravitating barotropic disks in keplerian motion .",
    "we show that , contrary to the folk belief , the keplerian rotation curve in pure hydrodynamics does not exclude heavy disks .",
    "the angular frequency of the rotation curve does depend on the two masses , but they do not contribute additively .",
    "we start the discussion with analytic results concerning configurations with strictly ( or almost strictly ) keplerian rotation law , that is where @xmath9 is equal ( or close ) to @xmath10 .",
    "this happens for elongated disks , for which the ratio of the innermost radius @xmath11 to the outermost one @xmath12 is small ( or tends to zero ) , or in the test - fluid regime , that is when the gravity of the disk can be neglected .    in numerical calculations we specialise to polytropic equations of state .",
    "the results show that the angular frequency @xmath4 satisfies @xmath13 , but the precise value of @xmath4 depends on the geometry of the disk , in particular on the ratio @xmath14 . if @xmath15 is small enough , then the central mass is reasonably well approximated by the keplerian expression @xmath16 .",
    "a significant deviation from this value can occur for elongated disks when their mass exceeds the central mass by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "in contrast to that , when @xmath17 , the ratio @xmath16 yields a value close to the central mass @xmath5 only when in addition @xmath18 ; in such a case the disk must be geometrically thin . in this specific example , obtained for the polytropic index @xmath19 , if @xmath20 , the disk becomes thick and @xmath21 instead of 1 ; the latter ratio grows rapidly with the further increase of @xmath8 .",
    "models of equilibrium toroidal or disk - like figures constitute a great simplification of the astrophysical reality .",
    "while such configurations appear in the late stages of current simulations of binary mergers , the theory of thick accretion disks would require more complex modelling .",
    "nevertheless , we are convinced that a good understanding of the properties of self - gravitating equilibrium disk - like figures is a prerequisite for the construction of more realistic models ( cf .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "we consider a stationary , self - gravitating disk of gas rotating around a central point mass @xmath5 .",
    "the gravitational potential of the system can be written as the superposition @xmath22 , where the potential @xmath23 is due to the gravity of the disk .",
    "it satisfies the poisson equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 denotes the mass density of the gas . here",
    "@xmath26 are the cartesian coordinates originating at the central point - like mass . in the following",
    "we will also work in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath27 .",
    "assume that the disk is axially symmetric and occupies a finite volume .",
    "the last demand imposes a condition onto equations of state , as discussed in appendix a. for technical reasons we will also assume that the fluid region is connected , and that it is equatorially symmetric .",
    "the velocity of the gas is @xmath28 or equivalently @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the unit azimuthal vector .",
    "a classical result due to poincar and wavre states that for a barotropic equation of state @xmath2 depends only on the cylindrical radius @xmath3 @xcite",
    ". we will deal later with polytropic equations of state @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the gas pressure , and @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constant .",

    "@xmath38 denotes the specific enthalpy of the fluid : @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the centrifugal potential .",
    "the structure of the disk can be obtained from eqs .",
    "( [ poisson ] ) and ( [ euler ] ) provided that the equation of state and the rotation law @xmath41 are known .",
    "we would like to point out that the process of solving of eq .",
    "( [ euler ] ) consists in the simultaneous finding of the unknown functions and of the volume where the enthalpy @xmath38 is nonnegative .",
    "in the rest of this paper we investigate systems with the keplerian rotation laws @xmath42 they are of special interest , because they agree with many observations . almost all",
    "known stellar black holes with gaseous disks and a few of agn s obey this law .",
    "suppose now that in an accretion system the motion of a gaseous disk conforms to a keplerian rotation law .",
    "the mass of gas ( usually unknown to an observer ) can impact the rotation curve . _",

    "this is a well known fact , and we give in sec .",
    "3.1 a proof , only for the sake of completeness .",
    "thus , in this case , one can obtain the value of the central mass simply by measuring the rotation frequency . _",
    "ii ) _ for thick and heavy disks the situation is more complex . there is still a possibility to prove analytically the approximate equality @xmath43 , but only in special cases and under certain assumptions on disk s geometry .",
    "these results are discussed in sec .",
    "3.2 and 3.3 .    in the generic case",
    "the presence of massive disks influences the rotation curve , or strictly saying , the frequency parameter .",
    "our numerical analysis , reported in later sections , suggests that the difference @xmath45 is strictly positive and increases with the increase of @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the mass of the disk .",
    "a result of hur et al .",
    "@xcite ( obtained for dust ) suggests that the difference @xmath45 should be proportional to the ratio @xmath46 .",
    "we show later that this is not true for polytropes .    the centrifugal potential for the rotation law ( [ kepl ] )",
    "can be written in the form @xmath48 .",
    "suppose that the disk is finite and extends from the innermost cylinder labelled by @xmath11 to the outermost cylinder at @xmath49 , and the innermost and outermost points of the disk are located on the equatorial plane .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "( [ euler ] ) that @xmath50 or @xmath51 because @xmath38 should vanish both for @xmath11 and @xmath12 . here",

    ", however , we deal with finite - volume configurations for which @xmath57 can be negative , and the analytic argument of sec .",
    "3.4 does not work ( the relation between the equation of state , keplerian rotation , and the sign of @xmath57 is discussed in appendix a ) .",

    "( [ omega ] ) , which yields @xmath62 .    to prove part _",

    "( [ omega_from_c ] ) yields @xmath63 in the limit of @xmath64 . in this case",
    "( [ euler ] ) should be written as @xmath65 and this form admits ( notice that @xmath66 when @xmath61 ) only infinitely thin disks at @xmath67 .",
    "let us fix the maximum density within the disk , say @xmath68 , and let @xmath12 be also fixed .",
    "this choice is justified by the scaling symmetry of the equations ( see sec .",
    "[ rescaling ] ) .",
    "then , it follows from eq .",
    "( [ omega ] ) that @xmath69 as @xmath70 . to show this",
    ", it suffices to note that @xmath23 is a bounded function on @xmath71 . to be more precise",
    ": @xmath72 must be finite when @xmath73 is fixed .",
    "the above result can be intuitively understood , because for @xmath3 small enough , the gravitational potential is always dominated by the divergent term @xmath74 . in practice ,",
    "if the ratio @xmath14 is sufficiently small , then the rotation curve of the gaseous disk should be influenced `` almost exclusively '' by the central mass .",
    "we show later , solving specific examples , that this is true .",
    "one can also show that @xmath69 as @xmath75 , that is when disk becomes ring - like with a small inner radius @xmath76 .",
    "the proof proceeds according to the squeeze theorem . for the sake of simplicity the second part of the reasoning",
    "( the bound from below ) will be presented for polytropic equations of state , but the proof can be reformulated for general barotropes satisfying certain additional conditions .",
    "the starting point is the virial relation formulated in mach @xcite for the system consisting of a steady disk and a point mass .",
    "it yields @xmath77 for keplerian rotation this equation can be written as @xmath78 now , because @xmath79 we have @xmath80 and , since @xmath81 , @xmath82 let @xmath83 denote the minimum value of the potential @xmath23 in the region where @xmath84 .",
    "we have @xmath85 and thus @xmath86 for @xmath87 the mass of the disk tends to zero ( note that we keep @xmath73 fixed , and the volume of the disk tends to zero ) , and so does the gravitational potential @xmath88 .",
    "thus , in the limit we have @xmath89 .    on the other hand",
    ", the same formulation of the virial theorem gives @xmath90 which , for polytropic equations of state implies that @xmath91 from the integrated euler equation we have @xmath92 where @xmath93 , and @xmath94 denotes a cylindrical radius of the point where the density reaches its maximum .",
    "for simplicity we have assumed that the maximum lies on the equatorial plane .",
    "the second equality expresses the euler equation at the outer boundary .",
    "now , for @xmath87 we have @xmath95 as well . in this limit",
    "one obtains @xmath96 , so that @xmath97 .",
    "this concludes the proof .      if disks are infinitely extended and posses a finite mass , then @xmath98 .",
    "( an infinite extension imposes severe restrictions onto the allowed equations of state  see also the discussion in appendix a. ) we claim that in this case @xmath99 .    indeed , eq .  ( [ poisson ] ) yields , from the maximum principle @xcite , that the potential @xmath23 is nonpositive everywhere and vanishes at spatial infinity .",
    "thus eq .",
    "( [ omega_from_c ] ) implies that the rotational angular frequency must exceed the keplerian value and @xmath99 .",
    "the same argument would work for the constant @xmath100 , but it is not clear whether such configurations exist .",

    "<S> = 500 we investigate accreting disk systems with polytropic gas in keplerian motion . numerical data and partial analytic results show that the self - gravitation of the disk speeds up its rotation  its rotational frequency is larger than that given by the well known strictly keplerian formula that takes into account the central mass only . </S>",
    "<S> thus determination of central mass in systems with massive disks requires great care  </S>",
    "<S> the strictly keplerian formula yields only an upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of self - gravity depends on geometric aspects of disk configurations . </S>",
    "<S> disk systems with a small ( circa @xmath0 ) ratio of the innermost radius to the outermost disk radius have the central mass close to the upper limit , but if this ratio is of the order of unity then the central mass can be smaller by many orders of magnitude from this bound . </S>"
