    "the discovery of the top quark in 1995 @xcite marked the triumph of the standard model(sm ) of particle physics . since the discovery , more interest on top quark physics research is stimulated in both experimental and theoretical respects .",
    "because of its large mass which is close to the electroweak scale , the top quark physics research may play an important role in the study of the electroweak symmetry breaking and therefore of the origin of the fermion masses . through the study on it people also",
    "hope to find clues of possible `` new physics '' .    within the framework of sm",
    "the dominant top quark decay channel is @xmath1 , which has a time scale @xmath2 much shorter than the time scale of the non - perturbative qcd effect .",
    "this character of top quark makes it behaves almost like a free particle , which is helpful in the precise study on it . with the operation of cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) in the future",
    "there will be enormous top quark events obtained in every year and that provides it practically possible to make the more detailed study on many properties of top quark .",
    "because of the importance of top quark decay stated above , a lot theoretical efforts have been made in the studies of radiative corrections to its decays . in the sm",
    ", the qcd and electroweak corrections to the @xmath3 decay can be found in @xcite .",
    "recently , the order @xmath4 qcd radiative corrections on some specific situations are presented in literatures @xcite . beyond the sm , based on the two higgs doublet model ( 2hdm ) the radiative corrections to @xmath1",
    "are calculated in @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric ( susy ) contributions of both qcd and electroweak are given in @xcite .",
    "the top quark semileptonic decays is also one of the major and important decay channels of the top quark , because there is a great portion of w decay probability will proceed leptonic pattern . before the top quark was detected ,",
    "it was long believed that the top mass maybe less than that of w boson s .",
    "so , the @xmath0 processes @xcite were taken into consideration even earlier than @xmath1 process . and also the qcd corrections to it was completed @xcite , which was found coincides with results in ref.@xcite after taking the @xmath5 on its mass shell . in this paper",
    "we present a calculation on susy qcd radiative corrections to the top quark semileptonic decays , which we find is still not appeared in literatures .",
    "the relevant feynman diagrams for the one - loop virtual gluino corrections to the top quark semileptonic decay process @xmath6 are shown in fig .",
    "1 . the tree - level amplitude ( fig.1(a ) )",
    "can be written down straightforwardly using the standard feynman rules , @xmath7 [ \\bar u_{\\nu_l}(k_3)\\gamma^\\mu p_l v_{\\bar l}(k_2)].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath8 is the momentum transfer carried by the w boson , @xmath9 is the left - handed helicity projection operators , and the @xmath10 is the square of the sine of the weinberg angle , @xmath11 .    in one - loop calculations , we will use dimensional regularization to control all the ultraviolet divergences in the virtual loop corrections and we will adopt the on - mass - shell renormalization scheme @xcite . it is noted that dimensional reduction approach is widely used in the calculations of the radiative corrections in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) as it automatically preserves the supersymmetry ( at least to one - loop order ) , while dimensional regularization does not .",
    "but in the calculations of susy qcd corrections to the process concerned , the dimensional reduction scheme is the same with the conventional dimensional regularization one .",
    "the one - loop amplitude of the discussed process can be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 represent the counterterm and the un - renormalized amplitude , respectively . and , @xmath15 where @xmath16 + 4 m_{\\tilde{g } } m_t^3 \\cos\\theta \\sin\\theta   ( \\dot b_0(3)+ \\dot b_0(4 ) ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\sin^2\\theta [ ( m_{\\tilde{t}_1}^2-m_{\\tilde{g}}^2 ) ( b_0(1)-b_0(3 ) ) -m_t^2 b_0(4 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & + ( m_t^2(-m_{\\tilde{g}}^2+m_{\\tilde{t}_1}^2-m_t^2 ) ( \\dot b_0(3)+ \\dot b_0(4))]\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath17 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] are the wave - function renormalization constants for top and bottom quark respectively .",
    "in above and following equations the @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 functions result from the evaluation of certain loop integrals , expressions for which can be found in @xcite . in equation ( 4 ) , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are abbreviations of variables in @xmath18 function , which represent @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively . throughout our calculations",
    ", we will omit the bottom scalar left- and right - handed mixing , but consider the top scalar mixing , because of the small bottom quark mass compared with the top quark mass , the definition of the mixing angle of top scalar @xmath28 can be found in next section .",
    "@xmath29    where @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38 @xmath39 here , ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in the parentheses of above equations are the variables of @xmath40 function which represent @xmath41 and @xmath42 for simplicity , respectively .    the corresponding amplitude squared of the process @xmath43 can then be expressed as @xmath44",
    "in our numerical calculations , we choose @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 gev , @xmath48 gev , @xmath49 gev , @xmath50 gev , and @xmath51 gev , which are commonly used in literatures @xcite .    in the mssm the squark mass eigenstates @xmath52 and @xmath53",
    "are related to the current eigenstates @xmath54 and @xmath55 by @xmath56 with @xmath57 the mixing angle @xmath28 and the masses @xmath58 of squarks can be obtained by diagonalizing the following mass matrices @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 @xmath61 @xmath62 in eq.([eq2])-([eq23 ] ) , @xmath63 , @xmath64 are soft susy breaking mass terms of the left- and right - handed squark , respectively ; @xmath65 is the coefficient of the @xmath66 mixing term in the superpotential ; @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the coefficients of the dimension - three trilinear soft susy - breaking term ; @xmath69 are the weak isospin and electric charge of the squark @xmath70 . from eqs.([eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) @xmath71 and @xmath28 can be derived out @xmath72 ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath73    the results of percentage change in the top quark semileptonic decay width , @xmath74 , after considering the susy qcd corrections are presented in figs",
    ". 2 - 4 . in numerical calculations",
    "we also assume @xmath75 gev and @xmath76 ( the so - called global susy ) . from the tevatron dileptons and jet + @xmath77 analysis under certain assumptions and parameter inputs",
    ", people get that @xmath78 gev @xcite and @xmath79 gev ( especially for the stop lower limit ) presently @xcite .    in fig .",
    "2 we show the relative corrections of one - loop susy qcd to the @xmath0 decay widths as the function of @xmath80 , while keeping the @xmath81 and tan@xmath82 fixed . taking @xmath83 gev and tan@xmath84",
    "we find that the total relative correction for @xmath85 reaches -0.6% from -0.33% as the @xmath80 goes from 100 gev to 300 gev . in fig .",
    "3 we take the @xmath80 and tan@xmath82 fixed , @xmath86 and tan@xmath84 , and show the relation of relative correction with the @xmath81 .",
    "it can be seen that the relative correction grows up till -0.9% with the decline of @xmath81 down to 150 gev . in fig.4",
    "we show the dependence of relative correction on tan@xmath82 when take @xmath87 gev and @xmath88 gev .",
    "the correction varies from -0.6% to -0.41% with tan@xmath82 going from 2 to 50 , and it is interesting to note that the curve gradually goes to be flat with the growth of tan@xmath82 , which indicates that the correction is not closely sensitive to the value of tan@xmath82 as it larger than 10 .    in conclusion , we have calculated the susy qcd corrections to the semileptonic top quark decays .",
    "it is found that the corrections may reach the level of about one percent with a favorable parameter choice .",
    "because of the fact that the @xmath0 process has a large branching ratio in top quark decays , with the run of lhc in the future and then the large amount of top quark events obtained , we hope the precise measurement of top quark semileptonic decay may give indirect hints in the existence of susy .",
    "however , it should be noted that though results in fig.2 - 4 are independent of the top quark inclusive decay width , without a calculation of the inclusive decay width based on the current experimental allowed parameter choice information on the semileptonic decay width alone can not be used to reach a conclusion on susy .",
