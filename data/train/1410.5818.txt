    "in fact , the existence of massive quenched galaxies has been demonstrated as early as @xmath10 , only a couple billion years after the big bang ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . traditionally , scaling relations between global properties ( sizes , luminosities or masses , and kinematics ) of disk and elliptical galaxies",
    "have been studied separately to constrain their formation and evolutionary models .",
    "this approach is intuitive as late and early - type galaxies differ in most ways in the local universe .",

    "galaxies with quiescent stellar populations are rounder spheroids which follow de vaucouler light profiles in projection .",
    "furthermore , at fixed mass , quiescent galaxies are more compact than their star - forming counterparts ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these populations also appear to differ dynamically : star - forming galaxies are primarily supported by rotation and quiescent galaxies are dominated by dispersion support .",
    "the relationship between rotational velocity and galaxy luminosity ( or stellar mass ) , called the tully - fischer relation , describes the fundamental scaling of disk ( star - forming ) galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "early - type ( quiescent ) galaxies lie on a similar scaling relation between the luminosity and velocity dispersion , called the faber - jackson relation @xcite .",
    "the scatter around this relation tightens when galaxy sizes are included , indicating that quiescent galaxies are better described by the three parameter fundamental plane ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these relations have been used to constrain aspects of galaxy formation such as the growth of disks within dark matter halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and variations in the global mass - to - light ratios of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "observationally , measurements of these scaling relations have been extended to high redshift , adding the dimension of time to further constrain formation of star - forming disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "this `` progenitor bias '' ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) will become increasingly important as we connect the evolution of galaxies through earlier times .    as galaxy populations become less clearly bimodal at earlier epochs and individual galaxies likely transition between star - forming and quiescent periods ,",
    "it would be preferable to define a flexible framework that allows for star - forming and quiescent galaxies to be studied together to allow for this ambiguity . in this paper , we examine the scaling relations between galaxy structures ( light profile shapes and sizes ) , stellar masses ( from stellar population synthesis modeling ) , and dynamics ( velocity dispersions ) for star - forming and quiescent galaxies alike .",

    "[ sect : deimos ] .",
    "in general star - forming galaxies are more likely to  fail \" in this context .    the primary factor in failing to measure a velocity dispersion is the observed brightness of the galaxy : faint ( @xmath76 )",
    "galaxies are excluded either because they are intrinsically faint or are at the highest redshift end of this survey ( figures [ fig : completeness](a)-(c ) ) .",
    "furthermore , low mass galaxies , as defined based on stellar mass ( @xmath77 ) or inferred dynamics ( @xmath78@xmath79 ) are less likely to yield precise velocity dispersions , particularly those included as mask fillers .",
    "75% of failed measurements of quiescent galaxies , and @xmath80 for star - forming galaxies , have @xmath81 , therefore the sample is much more complete above this limit .",
    "blue star - forming galaxies are also more likely to fail , although this is partially related to the mass bias .",
    "additionally , this sample excludes many galaxies with the highest specific star formation rates ( ssfr ) ( see figure[fig : completeness](f ) ) .",
    "this can be understood as a combination of the aforementioned mass bias against low velocity dispersions and the fact that the youngest stellar population synthesis models have quite weak spectral absorption features ( aside from the balmer lines , which are masked in the dynamical fitting ) .",
    "although the existing sample spans a large range in morphologies and inclinations ( see images in figure[fig : images ] ) , there also appears to be a bias against face - on disks as many galaxies with rounder shapes ( @xmath82 in figure[fig : completeness](d ) ) and more disklike profiles ( srsic @xmath83 in figure[fig : completeness](e ) ) preferentially fail to produce successful dispersion measurements . for galaxies with rotation , such as inclined pure disks , the measured velocity dispersion is a combination of the rotational velocity and intrinsic velocity dispersion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) :    @xmath84    for a face - on inclination ( @xmath85 ) , the rotational velocity does not contribute at all to the measured velocity dispersion .",
    "for inclined galaxies , measured dispersions will be boosted by the rotational velocities ( by broadening the spectral features ) , which in turn makes them more likely to be included in the spectroscopic sample .",
    "the velocity dispersion of an edge - on disk galaxy provides an estimate of the overall dynamics of the galaxy , but just the intrinsic dispersion for a face - on galaxy .",
    "inclination , as probed by projected axis ratios , appears to have a minimal effect on the samples of galaxies presented in this paper , implying that intrinsic dispersions are high and possibly pointing to the prevalence of bulges in these massive galaxies ( see appendix [ sec : inclination ] ) .",
    "overall this sample is representative for massive galaxies at @xmath2 , but the results of the study will not be as comprehensive for lower mass galaxies or galaxies with high star - formation rates .",
    "the former is driven primarily by @xmath86 : deeper data would provide higher completeness to lower mass limits .",
    "the latter is a limitation to studying absorption line kinematics for very young systems .",
    "in this section we focus on two traditional scaling relations ( size - mass and mass - velocity dispersion , or the mass faber - jackson , relation ) to highlight the differences between star - forming and quiescent galaxies , both at @xmath6 and @xmath2 .",
    "these relations are non edge - on projections of the mass fundamental plane , which is the focus of subsequent sections .",
    "although the populations are distinguished based on their rest - frame colors , as a proxy for differences in stellar populations , the separation extends to the overall structural and dynamical properties of each sample of galaxies in this paper .    in figure[fig :",
    "mass_size_all ] we explore the size - mass relations of the star - forming and quiescent galaxies in the sdss and at @xmath2 . in figure[fig : mass_size_sdss ] , as in the subsequent @xmath6 figures in this paper , the distribution of galaxies in the sdss is demarcated by a series of contours .",

    "* at higher redshift ) .",
    "the discrepant normalizations for the two populations holds in both redshift ranges probed by this study .",
    "we note that the requirement of reliable velocity dispersion measurements biases this sample against galaxies with low masses and/or large sizes .",
    "therefore , a linear fit to these size - mass relations would be steeper than for purely photometric samples of galaxies .",
    "we indicate the approximate size - mass relation of @xmath89 galaxies ( gray solid line ) , above this line the samples likely suffer from incompleteness .",
    "additionally we include the @xcite size - mass relations for early - type ( dotted red line ) and late - type ( dashed blue line ) galaxies . by adopting the slopes of these relations , we fit the normalizations to each separate galaxy population ( solid red and blue lines ) .",
    "we note that the overall normalizations for this sample differ from the @xcite fits , likely due to the differences in @xcite size measurements adopted in this work relative to the nyu - vagc measurements @xcite used in that study .",
    "the latter measurements have been shown to underestimate galaxy sizes , by a factor that increases with srsic index ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , we include these fits mostly for relative comparisons and emphasize the importance of more complete photometric samples to properly measure the size - mass relation .",
    "figure[fig : mass_size ] shows the same relation for massive galaxies at @xmath2 .",
    "again , star - forming galaxies lie above quenched galaxies and both samples lie below the @xcite relations ; in this case this reflects the size evolution of galaxies .",
    "a comparison of figure[fig : mass_size_sdss ] to figure[fig : mass_size ] shows the same thing : both star - forming and quiescent galaxies populations exhibit lower normalizations at @xmath2 than for galaxies in the sdss ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * for more thorough and unbiased study of this evolution to @xmath90 ) .",
    "in figures [ fig : mass_size_n_sdss ] and [ fig : mass_size_n ] , we present the same size - mass relations split into bins of best - fit srsic index to emphasize the comparison at fixed profile shape .",
    "panel to panel differences suggest that the sizes of galaxies depend on srsic index in addition to stellar populations and stellar mass .",
    "this is particularly obvious for quenched galaxies , however the trends in normalization do not vary linearly with srsic index . instead , for galaxies in the sdss",
    ", sizes decrease with srsic index for @xmath91 and then increase with larger srsic indices . a similar trend exists for high @xmath92 quiescent galaxies in the @xmath2 sample , but the sample size for star - forming and low-@xmath92 galaxies too small to assess similar trends in size with srsic index .",
    "additionally , figure[fig : mass_size_n_sdss ] demonstrates that the size difference between star - forming and quenched galaxies exists for the entire population and at fixed srsic index .",
    "this is particularly noteworthy and suggests , for example , that a star - forming galaxy whose profile looks like an elliptical galaxy ( @xmath93 ) will be larger than a quiescent elliptical galaxy with the same stellar mass .",
    "although such galaxies are less common ( star - forming galaxies generally have lower srsic indices ) , this suggests that the difference between star - forming and quiescent galaxies is less clear than a simple separation between disks and ellipticals .",
    "figure[fig : mass_size_n ] demonstrates that star - forming galaxies in the @xmath2 sample are also larger and have lower srsic indices than their quiescent counterparts",
    ". however , the sample is quite small , so this trend at fixed srsic index is less pronounced , particularly at high values of @xmath92 .",
    "the quiescent galaxies also suggest a similar trend of larger size with srsic index , but a larger , less biased sample would be better suited for measuring this effect .",
    "finally , we emphasize that for any sample of galaxies , mass - size relations have a significant amount of scatter ; individual star - forming and quiescent galaxies with exactly the same masses , sizes , and srsic indices are likely to exist .",
    "we caution against drawing conclusions from comparisons between small samples of galaxies .",
    "similarly , we compare the mass - velocity dispersion relations ( `` stellar mass '' faber - jackson relation , or the @xcite relation with luminosity multiplied by @xmath17 ) for star - forming and quiescent galaxies in the full samples ( figure[fig : mass_sigma ] ) and at fixed srsic index ( figures[fig : mass_sigma_n_sdss ] and [ fig : mass_sigma_n ] ) .",
    "this projection of the mass fundamental plane has been studied extensively , particularly for early - type galaxies ; it has relatively low scatter but is not an edge - on projection of the mass fundamental plane . as discussed in ",
    "[ subsec : completeness ] , we use aperture - corrected velocity dispersions of star - forming galaxies in this analysis , which is a combination of intrinsic velocity dispersion , rotational velocity , and inclination ( see equation [ eq : sigmarot ] ) . the contribution of rotational velocity to this quantity is likely to be more important for star - forming galaxies .",
    "best - fit slope and normalization of the mass faber - jackson relations ( equation [ eq : sigma_fj ] ) for all galaxies and separately for star - forming and quiescent galaxies are reported in table [ tab : massfj ] .",

    "recently , @xcite and @xcite presented a similar trend for samples of quiescent galaxies at @xmath9 and @xmath101 respectively ; here we note that the result seems to hold for star - forming galaxies as well .    as in figure[fig : mass_size_n ] , the statistical power of this sample of galaxies breaks down at fixed srsic index ( figure[fig : mass_sigma_n ] ) .",

    "although the samples are small , we note that if anything the normalizations of the mass faber - jackson relation decrease with srsic index , exhibiting the opposite trend relative to the low - z sample of galaxies",

    "we emphasize the overall bimodality of the populations of galaxies separated initially based on their stellar populations . from this perspective",
    ", the structures ( both in size and light profile ) , stellar dynamics ( as measured by absorption line kinematics ) , and scaling relations between these properties should be treated separately .",
    "this would be important for the empirical measurement of galaxy scaling relations and for the theoretical study of the formation and evolution of galaxies which are constrained to follow following those relations .",
    "in contrast with the previous section , we turn our focus to the potential similarity between star - forming and quiescent galaxy populations .",
    "specifically , we present the existence of a mass fundamental plane for star - forming and quiescent galaxy populations alike . the mass fundamental plane is the plane in three - dimensional space between galaxy size ( effective radius , @xmath102 ) , velocity dispersion ( @xmath46 ) , and stellar mass surface density ( @xmath103 ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "although star - forming and quiescent galaxies are discrepant in size and velocity dispersion at fixed mass , figure[fig : massfp_all ] demonstrates that the two populations occupy different regions of the same plane . the mass fundamental plane can be written as :    @xmath104    at @xmath6 , we adopt the tilt of the mass fundamental plane from @xcite ( @xmath105=[1.629,-0.840]$ ] ) , as measured from a similar sample of galaxies in the sdss and allow the normalization ( @xmath106 ) of the mass fundamental plane to vary for each sample .",
    "there is some conflicting evidence in the literature regarding the evolution of the slope of the ( luminosity ) fundamental plane .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that there is no evidence for evolution in the tilt since @xmath107 , however with a larger sample of cluster data , @xcite found evidence of evolution in both slope and normalization of the plane with redshift .",
    "fitting the exact functional form of the fundamental plane is an extremely difficult problem as it requires careful modeling of sample selection effects , correlated observational errors , and intrinsic scatter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "therefore , we assume that the @xcite tilt of the mass fundamental plane also applies at higher redshifts , again allowing the normalization to vary .",
    "we verified that the assumption of a non - evolving tilt does not significantly bias any of our results as follows .",
    "first , we performed a simple fit of slope of the mass fundamental plane to the full @xmath2 galaxy sample using the least trimmed squares algorithm @xcite as implemented by the @xmath108 program @xcite to include observational errors in addition to intrinsic scatter .",
    "the plane is fit about each variable ; we adopt the averages of each coefficient : @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "we note that this is extremely close to the virial relation ( @xmath105=[2,-1]$ ] ) , and represents a significant evolution from the measured slope at @xmath6 , but emphasize the potential influence of selection biases on this measurement , which often slice through the plane at non - parallel angles .",
    "however , even with this extreme evolution , the decrease in scatter about @xmath111 or @xmath112 is minimal and comparable to the bootstrapped error estimates .",
    "therefore we are satisfied to adopt the @xmath6 tilt for the mass fundamental plane at all redshifts ; in  [ sec : sigma ] we include other three - parameter scaling relations .",
    "the best - fit normalization to all galaxies in a given redshift range is shown in each panel of figure[fig : massfp_all ] ( and later of figures[fig : massfp_n_sdss ] and [ fig : massfp_n ] ) as a dashed black line .",
    "normalizations to the separate star - forming and quiescent populations in each panel are included as solid blue and red lines ( either for all galaxies , or at fixed srsic index ) .",
    "we calculate the scatter about the fundamental plane as the standard deviation about @xmath111 , with errors estimated by a 1000 iteration bootstrap simulation .",
    "scatter for the total , quiescent , and star - forming populations are indicated in the lower right corners of each panel .",
    "figure[fig : massfp_sdss ] demonstrates clearly that to first order , star - forming and quiescent galaxies lie on nearly the same mass fundamental plane with only very small shifts in normalization ( @xmath113 ) .",

    "we estimate the contribution of measurement errors to this scatter by monte - carlo simulations within the errors and find an intrinsic scatter of @xmath116 for star - forming and @xmath4 for quiescent galaxies .    at fixed srsic index ( figure[fig : massfp_n_sdss ] ) , we isolate the effects of structural non - homology on the normalization of the plane .",
    "offsets in normalization from the overall mass fundamental plane are the largest for exponential disklike galaxies ( figure[fig : massfp_n_sdss](a)-(b ) ) , in particular for quenched galaxies . for the rare sample of quiescent disk galaxies , the overall normalization is higher by @xmath117 . in general , the normalization of the mass fundamental plane varies as a function of srsic index ( and less strongly on stellar population ) . in this projection ,",
    "low srsic index galaxies lie below the overall mass fundamental plane and high srsic index galaxies lie above .",
    "we fit residuals from the mass fundamental plane as parametrized by :    @xmath118    and refit the scatter about the non - homology corrected mass fundamental plane .",
    "this trend in offset with srsic index is the strongest for quiescent galaxies , with @xmath119 = [ -0.099,0.028]$ ] and including the trend decreases the scatter by @xmath120 to @xmath121 .",
    "this is in contrast with the shallower relation , @xmath119 = [ -0.083,0.015]$ ] , for star - forming galaxies , which yields only a @xmath122 decrease in scatter to @xmath123 .",
    "the normalization of the overall mass fundamental plane can be thought of as a population - weighted average over the structures of all galaxies ; for the entire population the trend,@xmath119 = [ -0.100,0.026]$ ] , is similar to that of the quiescent sample and an overall scatter of @xmath124 .",
    "we emphasize that these differences are small ( @xmath125 ) and that all galaxies lie on nearly the same plane .    at @xmath2",
    "the primary conclusion that star - forming and quiescent galaxies lie on roughly the same mass fundamental plane remains ( figure[fig : massfp ] )",
    ". however , the details are somewhat different .",
    "first , the scatter about these relations is larger than in the sdss sample .",
    "partially , this is driven by the smaller sample size as reflected by larger errors in the measured scatter ( estimated from bootstrap resampling ) .",
    "we assume that measurement errors are very similar for the two samples ( e.g. errors in @xmath17 ) ; implying intrinsic scatter of @xmath126 for all galaxies and @xmath127 for quiescent galaxies .",
    "this suggests that measurement errors have been underestimated for this sample or that the tightness of the mass fundamental plane decreases with redshift .",
    "measured scatter about the mass fundamental plane is slightly larger for star - forming galaxies , but this is within the errors . additionally , the overall normalization is slightly higher than at @xmath6 ( @xmath67 ) , as shown in @xcite .",
    "we discuss possible explanations for this effect in  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "furthermore , while there are slight offsets from the mass fundamental plane at fixed srsic index ( figure[fig : massfp_n ] ) , these are partially driven by small sample size .",

    "in  [ subsec : completeness ] we introduced a theoretical dependence of the measured velocity dispersion of a disk galaxy on observed inclination ( equation [ eq : sigmarot ] ) . in this formulation ,",
    "measured velocity dispersion will be a combination of intrinsic dispersion and inclination corrected rotational velocity .",
    "however , increasing intrinsic velocity dispersion , potentially due to the presence of a significant bulge component , would minimize the importance of inclination on the measured velocity dispersions .",
    "although the inclination of a galaxy can not be directly measured from the available data , we can use the projected axis ratio as a proxy measurement . in the following figures ,",
    "we assess trends in measured velocity dispersion as a function of axis ratio , and therefore inclination , for the entire population of galaxies and separated by stellar populations and morphologies .",
    "figure [ fig : sigma_ba ] , shows trends in measured velocity dispersion as a function of axis ratio for galaxies in the sdss ( left panel ) and at @xmath2 ( right panel ) . as in the previous figures ,",

    "slopes of the lines are indicated in the lower left corner of each panel . at both redshifts",
    ", there is little to no statistically significant trend in velocity dispersion with projected axis ratio for quiescent galaxies .",
    "however , there is a weak trend at each redshift for star - forming galaxies such that velocity dispersion decreases slightly for rounder galaxies .",
    "this effect is small , suggesting that although inclination does impact measured velocity dispersions , it is a very weak effect . in the sdss ,",
    "the mean change in velocity dispersion across the full range in axis ratio ( from @xmath165 to @xmath166 ) implies a discrepancy of only @xmath137 or a factor of @xmath167 in velocity dispersion .",
    "this effect appears to be stronger at @xmath2 , at which the same change in @xmath21 would imply @xmath168 difference or factor of @xmath169 in velocity dispersion .",
    "however , we note that the potential incompleteness of this sample for rounder galaxies may impact the measurement of this trend .",
    "furthermore , the method of measuring galaxy dynamics differs subtly between the two samples : in the sdss , the velocity dispersion is measured within the @xmath23 fiber , whereas the @xmath2 spectra are integrated across a @xmath170 slit . at @xmath171 , @xmath23 corresponds to a physical scale of @xmath172 , compared to @xmath173 of the @xmath170 slit at @xmath2 .",
    "additionally , given the size evolution of galaxies , this larger physical aperture corresponds to an even larger fraction of the galaxies that are being probed in the higher redshift sample .",
    "this suggests within the centers of galaxies , such as those probed by the sdss fibers , the dynamics are more dominated by central bulges",
    ". however , at higher redshift , when the dynamics are probed in larger apertures , the effects of inclination will be stronger and could contribute to the scatter in such dynamical scaling relations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : sigma_ba_n_sdss ] , we evaluate the dependence of this trend on structural parameters ( in the sdss only ) , splitting galaxies into bins of srsic index .",
    "color - coding , notations , and symbols are as in figure [ fig : sigma_ba ] . in these panels",
    ", we see that the trends with axis ratio are stronger for more disklike galaxies ( at lower srsic",
    "n ) , for both star - forming and quiescent galaxies . above @xmath93 ,",
    "the trends all but disappear .",
    "this is partially due to the fact that these disky galaxies likely have more oblate structures and therefore axis ratio will be a more sensitive probe of inclination .",
    "additionally , one would expect these galaxies to have more rotational support ( higher @xmath174 ) , which determines the contribution of inclination to equation [ eq : sigmarot ] .",
    "although this paper demonstrates that the scaling relations of massive galaxies can be determined without the inclusion of an inclination correction , we conclude that the inclination of galaxies with disklike morphologies will contribute a small amount of scatter to the relations .",
    "this may become increasingly important for higher redshift studies , as the effect will likely increase with the physical scale of the spectroscopic aperture relative to the decreasing sizes of evolving galaxy populations .",
    "the stellar mass faber - jackson relation for star - forming and quiescent galaxies differs in normalization and slope , therefore the measured relation for the overall population of galaxies at a given redshift will be an average of the two relations . in  5 , we demonstrated that the scatter about the faber - jackson relation is greater than the scatter in relations which incorporate galaxy sizes .",
    "locally , the fundamental plane for elliptical galaxies exhibits less scatter than its projection , the faber - jackson relation , however in this appendix we investigate whether some of this scatter is due to adopting a uniform definition of the faber - jackson relation for both galaxy populations .",
    "figure [ fig : faberjackson]a shows the faber - jackson relation for galaxies in the sdss .",
    "the black line indicates the overall scaling relation ( used in figure [ fig : sigmasigma_sdss]a , the dashed blue and red lines indicate the fits to the star - forming and quiescent populations .",
    "scatter about the velocity dispersion predicted by these relations are shown in the center ( quiescent ) and right ( star - forming ) panels .",
    "scatter for all galaxies ( in black ) , quiescent galaxies ( red ) , and star - forming galaxies ( blue ) is indicated in the upper left corner of each panel .",
    "it is clear that although using the individual relations reduces the scatter in the mass faber - jackson relation very slightly ( @xmath175 ) , the three dimensional planes exhibit far lower scatter for star - forming and quiescent galaxies alike .",
    "in this appendix , we investigate the scatter in the mass fundamental plane and the virial relations in an additional projection ( see also figures [ fig : massfp ] , [ fig : massfp_n_sdss ] , and [ fig : massfp_n ] ) . for each relation , we calculate the scatter about @xmath111 .",
    "the slopes of the scaling relations are held fixed , but in each case the normalization is allowed to vary , although this will not affect the scatter .",
    "best - fit normalizations , measured and intrinsic scatter , as determined through monte - carlo simulations , are included in table [ tab : re_re ] .",
    "figure [ fig : re_re_sdss ] illustrates the scatter about @xmath111 in the sdss .",
    "the left panel includes sizes inferred by the mass fundamental plane , the center panel from the virial theorem with a fixed constant and the right panel with a srsic - dependent constant .",
    "figure [ fig : re_re ] follows the same layout , but includes galaxies in the deimos sample . unlike the scatter in velocity dispersion ( see figures [ fig : sigmasigma_sdss ] and [ fig : sigmasigma ] ) , the scatter in the mass fundamental plane is significantly tighter than that of the virial relations .",
    "however , we expect this to be due , at least in part , to correlated errors in sizes and stellar mass surface densities . in this projection ,",
