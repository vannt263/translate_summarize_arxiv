    "muon colliders appear to be emerging as a promising complement and/or alternative to proton and electron colliders for experimental high energy physics ( hep ) studies at the high energy frontier .",
    "they also provide some interesting possibilities for precision studies in hep , particularly in neutrino physics .",
    "this paper consists of three main sections .",
    "the first section gives a very brief description of muon collider technology then two longer sections give introductions to the neutrino physics potential and collider physics potential of muon colliders , respectively .    .",
    "self - consistent parameter sets for muon colliders at com energies ranging from 0.1 tev to 100 tev . for completeness ,",
    "beam parameters and collider ring parameters have been included along with the physics parameters , and the generation and optimization of these parameter sets is described in reference [ 2 ] . except for the first parameter set , which has been studied in some detail by the muon collider collaboration",
    ", these parameters represent speculation by the author on how muon colliders might evolve with energy . [ cols=\">,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     another major motivation for murine s is the potential for greatly improved measurements of nucleon structure functions ( sf ) .",
    "knowledge of these sf s is crucial for precision measurements in neutrino physics , charged lepton scattering experiments and some precision analyses at proton - proton and lepton - proton colliders .",
    "further , they provide important tests of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , and a murine might well be the best single experiment of any sort for the examination of perturbative qcd  @xcite .",
    "neutrino physics has also had an important historical role in measuring the electroweak mixing angle , which is simply related to the mass ratio of the w and z intermediate vector bosons : @xmath0 ( to be precise , this is the sirlin on - shell definition of @xmath1 . )    now that @xmath2 has been precisely measured at lep , measurements of @xmath1 in neutrino physics can be directly converted to predictions for the w mass .",
    "the comparison of this prediction with direct @xmath3 measurements in collider experiments constitutes a precise prediction of the sm and a sensitive test for exotic physics modifications to the sm  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite estimates that the predicted uncertainty in @xmath3 from a murine analysis might be of order 10 mev , which improves by an order of magnitude on today s neutrino experiments  @xcite and is approximately equal to the projected best direct measurements from future collider experiments .",
    "there are currently several experimental indications  @xcite that neutrinos might have non - zero masses and oscillate in flight between the flavor eigenstates .",
    "the probability for an oscillation between two of the flavors is given by@xcite : @xmath4.l[km ] }                                              { e_\\nu [ gev ] } \\right ) ,   }                                          \\label{eq : oscprob}\\ ] ] where the first term gives the mixing strength and the second term gives the distance dependence .",
    "reference  @xcite obtains the following order - of - magnitude mass limit for an assumed long - baseline detector with reasonable parameters and with full mixing : @xmath5 relatively independent of the distance to the detector .",
    "similarly , a mixing probability sensitivity for @xmath6 events in a short - baseline detector is found to be as low as @xmath7 for the most favorable value of @xmath8 .",
    "both of these estimates apply generically to all 3 possible mixings between 2 flavors : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "( see also reference  @xcite for another discussion of neutrino oscillations at a murine . )",
    "the @xmath8 estimate is more than an order of magnitude better than any proposed accelerator or reactor experiments for @xmath11 and @xmath10 , and is competitive with the best such proposed experiments for @xmath9 .",
    "the estimated value for @xmath12 is even more impressive",
    " orders of magnitude better than in any other current or proposed experiment for each of the three possible oscillations .",
    "such an experiment would either convincingly refute or accurately characterize the claimed observations of oscillations by both the lsnd and super - kamiokande collaborations .    as an interesting final topic",
    ", murine s should be rather impressive factories for the study of charm  with a clean , well reconstructed sample of several times @xmath13 charmed hadrons produced in @xmath6 neutrino interactions .",
    "there are several interesting physics motivations for charm studies at a murine  @xcite . as an example",
    ", particle - antiparticle mixing has yet to be observed in the charm sector  @xcite , and it is quite plausible  @xcite that a murine would provide the first observation of @xmath14 mixing .",
    "this section explores the collider physics opportunities at muon colliders through reference to the example collider parameter sets of table  [ specs ] .",
    "complementary discussion on the collider physics aspects of these parameters can be found in  @xcite , where it is opined that each parameter set has some aspects that appear challenging but none of the parameter sets are obviously implausible .",
    "admittedly , table 1 gives a rather incomplete sampling of the possibilities and , for example , discussions of additional physics options with sub - tev muon colliders may be found in  @xcite .",
    "the section begins with a discussion on muon collider design constraints due to the potential neutrino radiation hazard  a serious problem that is unique to muon colliders  before examining , in turn , the physics potential of each of the parameter sets in table  [ specs ] .",
    "a serious and unexpected problem that has arisen for multi - tev colliders is the potential radiation hazard posed by neutrinos emitted from muon decays in the collider ring  @xcite .",
    "these neutrinos produce a `` radiation disk '' in the plane of the ring , and the potential radiation hazard results from the showers of ionizing particles from occasional neutrino interactions in the soil and other objects bathed by this disk .",
    "although the neutrino cross - section is tiny , this is greatly compensated by the enormous number of tightly collimated high energy neutrinos produced at the collider ring .    with some reasonable assumptions ,",
    "the approximate average numerical value for the annual radiation dose in the plane of the collider ring is easily derived to be  @xcite : @xmath15 } \\simeq        { \\rm 0.044 \\times \\frac { f_b[hz ] \\times n_0[10^{12 } ]                   \\times ( 1-e^{-t_d[\\gamma \\tau_\\mu ] } )                   \\times ( e_\\mu[tev])^3 } { d[m ] } }                                    \\label{eq : nurad},\\ ] ] with notation as in table  [ specs ] and assuming an accelerator running time of @xmath16 seconds per year . for comparison , the u.s .",
    "federal off - site radiation limit is 1 msv / year , which is of the same order of magnitude as the typical background radiation from natural causes ( i.e. 0.4 to 4 msv / yr  @xcite ) .    to explain the form of equation  [ eq : nurad ] , the inverse dependence of the neutrino radiation on the collider depth arises because the radiation levels fall as the inverse square of the distance from the ring while the distance to reach the earth s surface , assuming a spherical earth , goes as the square root of the depth",
    "also , the cubic dependence on the collider energy comes from combining the approximately linear rises with energy of a ) the neutrino cross section b ) the energy deposited per interaction , and c ) the beam intensity due to the decreasing angular divergence of the neutrinos in the vertical plane(equation  [ eq : thetanu ] ) .",
    "( there are actually some mitigating factors that come into play at the highest energies and are not included in equation  [ eq : nurad ]  @xcite . )",
    "this equation is not intended to be accurate at much better than an order of magnitude level and is deliberately conservative , i.e. it may well overestimate the radiation levels .",
    "because of the energy dependence , the radiation levels rapidly become a serious design constraint for colliders at the tev scale and above .",
    "the radiation intensity may be greatly enhanced downstream from straight sections in the collider ring , with the additional intensity rising in proportion to the length of the straight section . as a benchmark , the length of straight section to produce ten times the planar average dose , @xmath17 , may be shown  @xcite to be approximately : @xmath18 \\simeq 0.3 \\times \\frac{c[km]}{e_\\mu[tev ] } }                                      \\label{eq : lx10}.\\ ] ] this equation shows that the intensity from the straight section picks up another power of the collider energy , which is due to the falling horizontal angular divergence , but this is approximately compensated for by the collider circumference also rising in approximate proportion to the beam energy . as can be seen from table  [ specs ] , @xmath17 is only of order a meter at all collider energies , so great care must be taken in the design of the collider ring to minimize or eliminate long straight sections .    because of the cubic rise with energy of the neutrino radiation intensity , muon colliders at com energies of beyond a few tev will probably have to be constructed at isolated sites where the public would not be exposed to the neutrino radiation disk .",
    "such sites clearly exist , perhaps even with useful existing infrastructure .",
    "( an extreme example would be close to a nuclear test site , such as in nevada , u.s.a . )",
    "these will presumably be `` second generation '' machines , arriving after the technology of muon colliders has been established in one or more smaller and less expensive machines built at existing hep laboratories .      besides exploring the physics at the energy frontier , muon colliders with very narrow com energy spreads are particularly suited to both resonance production and threshold studies of elementary particles .",
    "the principal example of such a resonant process is the s - channel production of higgs bosons .",
    "the relatively strong coupling strength of muons to the higgs channel  approximately 40 000 times that for electrons  gives colliders a unique potential to study this process .",
    "the first parameter set in table 1 is intended for precision studies of a 100 gev sm - like higgs boson , hypothesized to have been discovered previously at either lep , the tevatron or the lhc .",
    "( of course , the com energy of the collider would actually be fixed at the true higgs mass . )",
    "the low com energy spread has been chosen to reproduce the predicted width of a sm higgs at this energy : 2 to 3 mev .",
    "after an initial coarse scan to find the exact energy of the resonance , a fine scan of the resonance would provide uniquely precise measurements of the higgs mass , width and cross - section .",
    "the technological issues specific to these higgs factory parameters have been evaluated in some detail over the past year by the mcc  @xcite .",
    "for example , a collider magnet lattice has been designed for the narrow momentum spread beam and the required precise beam calibration was found to be possible by measuring the rate of the muon spin precession .",
    "the physics case for an s - channel higgs factory has also been studied in some detail  @xcite .",
    "the effectiveness of the collider obviously depends on the existence of a higgs boson in the appropriate mass range .",
    "if the higgs is too light then , at currently assumed luminosities , the signal will be buried in the backgrounds from the z resonance . on the other hand ,",
    "the higgs width increases with mass , becoming too broad for effective study beyond about 150 gev .",
    "the following approximate scenarios emerge for a sm or sm - like ( e.g. supersymmetric ) higgs :    1 .",
    "@xmath19 : probable discovery at lep",
    ". backgrounds probably too high for an s - channel higgs factory .",
    "@xmath20 : fairly likely to be discovered at fnal but with poor mass resolution .",
    "an s - channel higgs factory will become useful following more precise @xmath21 measurements from the lhc and/or a future lepton collider with a com energy of a few hundred gev .",
    "3 .   @xmath22 ( this is now experimentally disfavored ) : the resonance would be too broad for an s - channel factory .",
    "( for completeness ) no higgs .",
    "a higgs factory is obviously not useful .    as an example of a detailed study for the higgs mass in a favorable region , reference  @xcite makes predictions for @xmath23 of on - peak data and a sm - like higgs with @xmath24 .",
    "they predict a resolution of approximately 0.1 mev on the higgs mass , 0.5 mev on the width and branching ratio determinations as accurate as 3 percent ( for the @xmath25 channel ) .",
    "these precise measurements on such an important elementary particle clearly provide strong motivation for this muon collider option , either as a stand - alone `` first muon collider '' or as a relatively inexpensive add - on to a complex with a higher energy machine",
    ".      the motivation for a 1 tev muon collider would be roughly the same as that of proposed linear colliders at the 1 tev energy scale  that is , to perform precision studies on whatever elementary particles are discovered at the lhc hadron collider and to search for new particles that will not be evident in the physical and experimental conditions of the lhc .",
    "thus , a 1 tev muon collider may be considered as a valuable back - up technology in case electron colliders at this energy either run into unforeseen technical difficulties or are found to be unacceptably expensive .",
    "further , such a muon collider may have a role to play even if a 1 tev e+e- collider is built , due to potentially different physics processes ( e.g. higgs - type particle production ) and also to differences in the beam specifications , as follows .",
    "one tev electron colliders should be able to achieve higher levels of polarization than their muon collider counterparts , which may have polarization levels in the region of 20%  @xcite . on the other hand , beamstrahlung at 1 tev electron colliders will result in roughly a 10% fractional spread in collision energy rather than the parts - per - mil spreads assumed for muon colliders .",
    "thus , electron colliders will be favored for studies where high polarization is important while muon colliders should do better in studies of resonances and in other processes where the com energy constraint is important .",
    "the 1 tev parameter set of table 1 would give about the same luminosity as , for example , the design for the proposed nlc linear electron collider  @xcite at the same energy , and the physics motivation and capabilities might be relatively similar .",
    "placement of the collider at 125 meters depth ( the approximate depth of the existing lep / lhc tunnel at cern ) reduces the average neutrino radiation in the collider plane to less than one thousandth of the u.s .",
    "federal off - site radiation limit .",
    "( as already mentioned , attention would still need to be paid to minimizing the length of any low - divergence straight sections in the collider ring . )",
    "muon colliders appear to have much greater potential than electron colliders to push to lepton collision energies above the lhc mass reach ( which might be roughly 1 to 2 tev , depending on the process ) .",
    "the 4 tev parameter set was chosen as being at about the highest energy that is practical for a `` first generation '' muon collider on an existing laboratory site , due to neutrino radiation .",
    "the same comments about neutrino radiation apply as in the 1 tev design and , in addition , it is necessary to greatly reduce the muon current , accepting the consequent loss in luminosity . the assumed 300 meter depth happens to correspond approximately to appropriate bedrock formations at both the bnl and fermilab hep laboratories .",
    "even the reduced luminosity of this parameter set , @xmath26 , appears sufficient to discover whatever elementary particles lie in the mass range of 1 to 4 tev ( i.e. beyond the reach of the lhc ) , provided only that the experimental signature for production is not particularly obscure and the production cross - section is not greatly suppressed relative to typical sm couplings ( as exemplified by the benchmark process , @xmath27 ) .",
    "an added motivation for building a `` first generation '' muon collider at the highest possible energy is that this would provide the best technical foundation for construction of the very high energy , high luminosity muon colliders ( 10 tev and above ) that are the ultimate goal of muon collider technology .",
    "the 4th parameter set of table  [ specs ] specifies a `` second generation '' muon collider at 10 tev com energy , assumed to be constructed at a site where neutrino radiation is not a constraint ( see the previous subsection on neutrino radiation ) .",
    "it is seen that the relaxed neutrino radiation constraint might allow an exciting luminosity of @xmath28 at several times the discovery mass reach of the lhc , making this collider an exciting prospect for the future progress of hep .",
    "besides mapping out the spectrum of elementary particles in the energy decade up to 10 tev , it is further reasonable to assume that anything already discovered at the lhc could be more fully studied in the much cleaner physics environment of such a lepton collider .",
    "particles in the 100 gev to 1 tev range should be copiously produced through higher order processes in a 10 tev muon collider , as evidenced by the production , via the ww - fusion process , of order ten million sm higgs particles per year ( assuming it exists with a mass below 1 tev ) .",
    "the technical difficulties specific to muon colliders at this energy scale and above have yet to be assessed in detail .",
    "it is comforting that relativistic kinematics makes the acceleration of the muons progressively easier at higher energies due to a rising muon lifetime , shrinking transverse bunch size and reduced sensitivity to disruptive influences such as wake fields . on the other hand ,",
    "detector backgrounds involving high energy muons will clearly become more challenging , as will the design and layout of the final focus magnets around the ip ( see  @xcite for details ) . to put this in perspective , these technical challenges will need to be compared with the considerable challenges that are essentially independent of the collider energy  particularly the construction and operation of the muon cooling channel .",
    "the highest energy parameter set in table 1 , at 100 tev , represents what is likely the ultimate energy scale for muon colliders , with a mass reach for discovering elementary particles that is probably inaccessible even to hadron colliders .",
    "the parameter set assumes technical extrapolations beyond today s limits and presents easily the most difficult design challenge of all the parameter sets , for the following reasons :    * cost reductions will be needed to make a machine of this size affordable * siting will be more difficult than at 10 tev , since the neutrino radiation is now well above the u.s .",
    "federal limit * the final focus design is much more difficult even than at 10 tev , as illustrated by the much larger demagnification factor ( see @xcite for further discussion ) * the muon bunches , although much smaller than in the other sets , are also much cooler ( again , see @xcite for further discussion ) * the beam power has risen to 170 mw , with synchrotron radiation rising rapidly to contribute a further 110 mw .",
    "it seems reasonable to assume that the rapid rise to prominence of the synchrotron radiation will effectively prohibit muon colliders at the pev energy scale , even if the other challenges could be negotiated .",
    "a 100 tev muon collider is clearly not a near - term prospect .",
    "however , the unique opportunity to explore the physics at this energy scale could well turn out to be crucial in unlocking the profound mysteries of the elementary particle spectrum and its role in the universe . with such compelling motivation ,",
    "it is certainly not ruled out that a muon collider at this energy scale could become achievable after a couple of decades of dedicated research and development .",
    "an overview has been given of the potential prospects for neutrino physics and collider physics at muon colliders and it has been shown that muon colliders may well come to assume a central role in the future of experimental high energy physics . their discovery reach for new elementary particles might eventually be in the region of 100 tev and they could also open up exciting new vistas in neutrino physics and other precision studies .",
    "this provides strong motivation for a continuing and expanding vigorous research and development program in muon collider technology , and such a program will be needed to make muon colliders a reality on an attractive timescale .    the muon collider collaboration , `` status of muon collider research and development and future plans '' , to be submitted to phys .",
