    "most of the accretion onto the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) found in the center of most massive galaxies is heavily obscured by the surrounding dust and gas ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in the local universe , @xmath075% of the seyfert 2",
    "galaxies are heavily - obscured ( @xmath4@xmath110@xmath5  @xmath6 ; @xcite ) .",
    "many of these , if at @xmath7@xmath81 , where most of the black hole growth occurs , would not be identified in x - rays even in very deep ( @xmath11 msec ) chandra or xmm / newton exposures @xcite .",
    "locating and quantifying this heavily obscured smbh growth , in particular at high redshifts , is currently one of the fundamental problems in astrophysics .",
    "because the energy absorbed at optical to x - ray wavelengths is later re - emitted in the mid - ir , it is expected that all active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , even the most obscured ones , should be very bright mid - ir sources ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that a large number of heavily obscured  even compton - thick ( @xmath4@xmath110@xmath9@xmath6 )  agn have been found amongst the luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( ( u)lirgs ; l@xmath10@xmath110@xmath2 and @xmath110@xmath11l@xmath3 respectively ) , both locally @xcite and at high redshift @xcite .",
    "deep x - ray observations performed using the xmm - newton ( e.g. , @xcite ) , chandra @xcite and suzaku @xcite observatories have shown that most ulirgs are intrinsically faint x - ray sources , most likely due to the effects of obscuration , while their x - ray spectra show combined signatures of starburst and agn activity .",
    "the key features observed in the x - ray spectra of ulirgs are a soft thermal component , typically associated with star formation , a heavily - obscured ( n@xmath12@xmath010@xmath9 @xmath6 ) power - law associated with the agn direct emission , and a prominent emission line at @xmath06.4  kev , identified with fluorescence emission from iron in the k@xmath13 ionization level , originating either in the accretion disk or in the surrounding material @xcite .",
    "the presence of heavily - obscured agn among the most extreme ulirgs at @xmath7@xmath141 - 2 has recently been established from deep spitzer observations @xcite .",
    "most of these sources have very high , quasar - like , intrinsic luminosities , and hence most likely do not constitute the bulk of the heavily - obscured agn population @xcite . establishing the fraction of ( u)lirgs",
    "that host a lower luminosity agn is a more challenging task .",
    "recent works based on x - ray stacking @xcite and using 70-@xmath15 m selected sources @xcite report a steep decrease in the fraction of agn with decreasing ir luminosity , going from @xmath0100% at l@xmath16=10@xmath17  l@xmath3 to @xmath1810% at l@xmath16=10@xmath19  l@xmath3 . in the local universe , @xcite found that the incidence of low - luminosity , seyfert - like , agn as a function of stellar mass is more complicated , and is influenced by other parameters .",
    "for example , the dependence of agn fraction on stellar mass can be opposite if galaxy morphology is considered ( increases with decreasing mass in the early - type galaxy population ) .    in this work",
    ", we estimate the fraction of heavily - obscured agn in mid - ir - luminous and massive galaxies at high redshift , few of which are individually detected in x - rays . the main goal is to constrain the amount of obscured smbh accretion happening in distant galaxies .",
    "this can be done thanks to the very deep x - ray observations available in the chandra deep fields and the very low and stable chandra background , which allows for the efficient stacking of individually undetected sources . throughout this letter ,",
    "we assume a @xmath20cdm cosmology with @xmath21=0.7 , @xmath22=0.27 and @xmath23=0.73 , in agreement with the most recent cosmological observations @xcite .",
    "by stacking individually - undetected sources selected at longer wavelengths , it is possible to detect very faint x - ray emitters using chandra observations . for example",
    ", this technique was used successfully by @xcite in the chandra deep field north ( cdf - n ) to measure the average x - ray emission from a sample of lyman break galaxies at @xmath7@xmath1424 and by @xcite to detect x - rays from red galaxies at @xmath7@xmath02 .",
    "more recently , samples of heavily - obscured agn candidates selected based on their mid - ir properties have been studied in x - rays via chandra stacking ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the 4 msec chandra observations of the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) , are currently the deepest view of the x - ray sky . in addition , the cdf - s has been observed extensively at many wavelengths . the multiwavelength data available on the ( e)cdf - s were presented by @xcite . very relevant for this work are the deep spitzer observations available in this field , using both the infrared array camera ( irac ) and the multiband imaging photometer for spitzer ( mips ) , from 3.6 to 24  @xmath15 m .",
    "also critical is the availability of good quality photometric redshifts ( @xmath24@xmath7/(1+@xmath7)=0.008 for @xmath25@xmath1825.2 ) obtained thanks to deep observations in 18 medium - band optical filters performed using subaru / suprime - cam @xcite .",
    "we generated our sample starting with the 4959 spitzer / mips 24  @xmath15 m sources in the region covered by the chandra observations that have photometric redshift @xmath7@xmath10.5 , and hence rest - frame e@xmath14  kev emission falling in the high - sensitivity chandra range . in addition , sources individually detected in x - rays and reported in the catalogs of @xcite , @xcite or @xcite were removed from our sample , as these sources will otherwise dominate the stacked spectrum .",
    "we then inspected the remaining sources to eliminate individual detections in the 4 msec data not present in the 2 msec catalog of @xcite .",
    "we further excluded 28 sources that meet the selection criteria of @xcite for heavily obscured agn , @xmath26/@xmath27@xmath11000 and @xmath25-@xmath28@xmath14.5 ( vega ) , because we expect these sources to contain an intrinsically luminous agn ( quasar ) , while the aim of this work is to find additional hidden accretion in less luminous objects .",
    "the median redshift of the sources in our final sample is 1.32 ( average @xmath7=1.5 ) with a standard deviation of 0.77 .    in order to perform x - ray stacking in the rest - frame",
    ", we started with the regenerated level 2 merged event files created by the chandra x - ray center .",
    "for each source , we extracted all events in a circle of 30@xmath29 radius centered in the optical position .",
    "the energy of each event was then converted to the rest frame using the photometric redshift of the source .",
    "using standard ciao @xcite tools we then generated seven x - ray images for each source covering the energy range from 1 - 8 kev in the rest - frame with a fixed width of 1 kev .",
    "images for individual sources were then co - added to measure the stacked signal .",
    "total counts were measured in a fixed 5@xmath29 aperture , while the background was estimated by randomly placing apertures with same the area , 5@xmath29 to 30@xmath29 away from the center .",
    "several groups have found ( e.g , @xcite and references therein ) that the fraction of galaxies containing an agn is a strong function of their ir luminosity .",
    "hence , it is a natural choice to divide our sample in terms of total ir luminosity .",
    "the infrared luminosity was estimated from the observed 24  @xmath15 m luminosity assuming the relation found by @xcite : @xmath30(l@xmath10)=1.02 + 0.972 @xmath30(l@xmath31 ) .",
    "we further assumed that the @xmath32 correction between observed - frame 24  @xmath15 m and rest - frame 12  @xmath15 m luminosity for these sources is negligible , as shown by @xcite .",
    "we then separated our sample in 4 overlapping bins : @xmath33@xmath110@xmath2@xmath34 , @xmath33@xmath15@xmath3510@xmath19@xmath34 , 5@xmath3510@xmath19@xmath34@xmath1@xmath33@xmath110@xmath19@xmath34 and @xmath33@xmath110@xmath19@xmath34 and stacked them independently .",

    "in addition to the starburst emission described above , the x - ray spectrum is described by an absorbed , compton - thick , power - law with @xmath37=1.9 , @xmath4=10@xmath9  @xmath6 , and a possible scattered component , characterized by a power - law with @xmath37=1.9 , no absorption , and 1% of the intensity of the direct emission .",

    "all of these are ( intrinsically ) very low - luminosity agn ; even if there is a range , it is extremely unlikely to include high - luminosity quasars like those discussed in previous stacking papers .",
    "an alternative possibility is that the extra emission at e@xmath15  kev is due entirely to the fe  k@xmath43 line , provided the errors in the photometric redshifts in these samples are significantly larger than the values reported by @xcite .",
    "regardless of the template assumed for the agn emission , we obtain similar values for the average agn luminosity in each sample .",
    "the median hard x - ray luminosity for the chandra sources with measured photometric redshifts in the catalog of @xcite is 4.1@xmath3510@xmath44 erg  s@xmath41 for the sources in the @xmath33@xmath110@xmath2@xmath34 sample , 3.5@xmath3510@xmath44  erg  s@xmath41 in the @xmath33@xmath15@xmath3510@xmath19@xmath34 group , 5.7@xmath3510@xmath40  erg  s@xmath41 for sources with 5@xmath3510@xmath19@xmath34@xmath1@xmath33@xmath110@xmath19@xmath34 and 1.6@xmath3510@xmath44  erg  s@xmath41 in the @xmath33@xmath110@xmath19@xmath34 sample .",

    "this result justifies our choice of removing these sources from our study ( otherwise they would dominate the stacked signal ) , while at the same time it confirms the agn nature of the vast majority of these sources , in contrast to the suggestion that the extra ir emission could be due to star - formation processes @xcite .",
    "a similar result for these high - luminosity sources was found by @xcite : in a sample of 99 mid - ir excess sources in the cosmos field he found a strong stacked signal at e@xmath06  kev , which he interpreted as due to the fe  k@xmath43 line , a clear signature of agn emission and high obscuration ( see discussion below ) .      by design",
    ", none of the sources in our sample are individually detected in x - rays , nor do they satisfy the selection criteria of @xcite .",

    "this suggests that the irac color - color diagram can not be used to identify heavily - obscured low - luminosity agn , because the near - ir emission in these sources is dominated by the host galaxy @xcite . at longer wavelengths ,",
    "83 of the 1545 sources with @xmath33@xmath15@xmath3510@xmath19@xmath34 were detected in the deep vla observations of the cdf - s @xcite .",
    "in contrast , only 33 sources in the 5@xmath3510@xmath19@xmath34@xmath1@xmath33@xmath110@xmath19@xmath34 sample were detected in these observations . using the @xmath48 ratio between 1.4 ghz and 24  @xmath15 m flux densities ( e.g. , @xcite )",

    "<S> we take advantage of the rich multi - wavelength data available in the chandra deep field south ( cdf - s ) , including the 4 msec chandra observations ( the deepest x - ray data to date ) , in order to search for heavily - obscured low - luminosity agn among infrared - luminous galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we obtained a stacked rest - frame x - ray spectrum for samples of galaxies binned in terms of their ir luminosity or stellar mass . </S>",
    "<S> we detect a significant signal at e@xmath01 to 8 kev , which we interpret as originating from a combination of emission associated with star - formation processes at low energies combined with a heavily - obscured agn at e@xmath15  kev . </S>",
    "<S> we further find that the relative strength of this agn signal decays with decreasing ir luminosity , indicating a higher agn fraction for more luminous ir sources . </S>",
    "<S> together , these results strongly suggest the presence of a large number of obscured agn in ir - luminous galaxies . using samples binned in terms of stellar mass in the host galaxy , we find a significant excess at e=6 - 7  kev for sources with m@xmath110@xmath2m@xmath3 , consistent with a large obscured agn population in high mass galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , no strong evidence of agn activity was found for less - massive galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the integrated intensity at high energies indicates that a significant fraction of the total black hole growth , @xmath022% , occurs in heavily - obscured systems that are not individually detected in even the deepest x - ray observations . </S>",
    "<S> there are also indications that the number of low - luminosity , heavily - obscured agn does not evolve significantly with redshift , in contrast to the strong evolution seen in higher luminosity sources . </S>"
