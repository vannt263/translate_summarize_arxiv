    "2003aw is the 6th member of the helium dwarf novae .",
    "this star was discovered as a supernova ( therefore named 2003aw ) by @xcite from the unfiltered neat image taken with the palomar 1.2 m schmidt telescope .",
    "the magnitude at the discovery on 2003 february 6 was 17.8 , and this ` supernova ' was seen also in the images taken on 2003 february 10 and 19 .",
    "@xcite obtained an optical spectrum , which had a quite blue continuum with weak he i emission lines and ca ii h and k absorption at nearly zero redshift .",

    "2003aw was in @xmath3 , and gave rise to a flare reaching @xmath4 . in the intermediate state and quiescence , 2003aw was at about @xmath5 and at around @xmath6 , respectively .",

    "2003aw was recorded to be at 15.115.7 mag with a brightening to 14.7 mag on may 20 . even considering the zero - point uncertainty of the magnitude and the color , this maximum magnitude far exceeds the brightest magnitude at a brightening ( @xmath4 ) in the ` high ' state during the 2003 february / march outburst @xcite .",
    "the detection of the superhumps ( described later ) indicates that this phase corresponds to the plateau phase of the superoutburst in am cvn stars and su uma - type dwarf novae .",

    "( 168mm,168mm)f2.ps    after the decline from the plateau phase , 2003aw kept its brightness around 18.0 mag , besides occasional flares reaching @xmath0 15.8 mag , for @xmath13 days . during this phase ,",
    "2003aw was still brighter by about 2.0 mag than in quiescence , which corresponds to the high state in @xcite .",
    "judging from our observations and those reported to vsnet ( see figure [ fig : lc ] ) , the duration of the flares is 1 day , or so , but a periodicity of the flare can not be supported nor rejected from the available sparse data .",
    "this behavior is completely consistent with that during the high state in the 2003 february / march active phase @xcite .",

    "the error of the period was estimated using the lafler - kinman class of methods , as applied by @xcite .",
    "this period is different by @xmath02 @xmath16 from the value [ 2041.5 ( @xmath70.3 ) s ] derived by @xcite .",
    "this difference can not be considered statistically significant , though a similar difference in the superhump period in the different outburst states were observed in another am cvn star , v803 cen @xcite . including the data shown in figures [ fig : sh]a and [ fig : sh]d did not improve the period determination .",
    "we could not detect firm evidence of any sidebands , which would be ( at least partly ) due to short coverages and low signal - to - noise ratios of our data .",

    "there is a hint of a dip after the superhump maximum on 2004 may 18 ( figure [ fig : shshape]a ) .",
    "the same phenomenon was observed by @xcite during the high state . on this day , the superhumps had a shape consisting of a rapid rise and a slow decline , which is typically seen in hydrogen - rich su uma - type dwarf novae . on the next day ,",

    "( 84mm,84mm)f4.ps    the timings of the superhump maxima were extracted by fitting the average superhump light curve in figure [ fig : shshape ] , and we tried to check the change of the superhump period between hjd 2454144.173 and 2453145.304 .",
    "the superhump period , however , stayed constant during this period .",
    "a periodicity attributable to the orbital modulation could not detected from any of our runs .",
    "our observations of 2003aw revealed the existence of the plateau phase of the superoutburst , which is brighter by @xmath05.0 mag than its quiescent magnitude , and the presence of superhumps with a period of 2036(3 ) s during this phase . following this phase ,",
    "the star sharply decayed with a rate over 1 mag d@xmath14 and stayed around 18.0 mag in the high state for @xmath020 days , having short flares with amplitudes of @xmath02.0 mag .",
    "this variable gradually faded after that .",
    "@xcite are considered to have missed the plateau phase , and have steadily observed the high state and the fading tail .",
    "the whole outburst light curve of 2003aw , taking into account the observations by us and @xcite , has strong resemblance to the superoutburst of the peculiar wz sge - type dwarf nova , eg cnc , in 19961997 @xcite , in terms of the first quite bright state ( the plateau phase in 2003aw , and the main superoutburst in eg cnc ) , the following repetitive - outburst state still brighter than the quiescence ( the high state in 2003aw , and the rebrightening phase in eg cnc ) , and the long fading tail to the quiescence ( the intermediate state in 2003aw , and the long fading tail in eg cnc ) .",
    "superhumps were observed throughout these states in both stars .",
    "the thermal - tidal disk - instability models for the am cvn stars have been developed by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "to explain the peculiar outburst behavior in eg cnc , a modification of the disk - instability model for hydrogen - rich dwarf novae was introduced by @xcite , adding an idea of the viscosity decay in the cold disk .",
    "a similar idea may be necessary in reconstructing the full outburst property of 2003aw , although we need further observations to clarify the total outburst pattern including that outside the superoutbursts . the repetition of the large flares after the plateau phase will be a key also in trying to consider the behavior of 2003aw with the models making use of the variation in the mass - transfer rate @xcite , or the effect of the magnetic fields on the primary white dwarf @xcite .",
    "the repetitive - outburst ( high ) state casts another problem concerning a notable difference in the superoutburst between 2003aw and eg cnc . in 2003aw , small brightness variations with an amplitude of @xmath170.4 mag and a period of @xmath016 h were observed , other than a large flare of 1.9 mag by @xcite , while corresponding modulations were not reported in eg cnc @xcite . the resemblance of the outburst - light curves between an am cvn star and a wz sge star was first pointed out by @xcite concerning v803 cen and wz sge . after the initial , long outburst stage ,",
    "v803 cen showed @xmath01 mag oscillations with periods of 0.81.0 d , which resembles the rebrightening stage of the 2001 superoutburst in wz sge . @xcite",
    "attributed those oscillations to some sort of thermal disk - instability , instead of the full - disk outbursts . to fully understand the outburst mechanism in 2003aw",
    ", we must explain the 0.4-mag oscillations with a timescale of 16 h and the occasional flares up to 2 mag .",
