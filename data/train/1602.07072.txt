    "this reminds us of the lorentzian space , which is the geometric setting of spacetime for the theory of relativity , where the cone of future points of @xmath37 is the ambient space of the physically possible trajectories of this point .",
    "the restriction of the distance function to the cone comes from the fact that a material particle travels at a speed which is less than the speed of light .",
    "thus , the set of points on the rays starting at @xmath37 that are on the boundary @xmath112 of the solid cone @xmath39 becomes an analogue of the  light cone \" of spacetime ( again using the language of relativity ) .",
    "however , in the case of lorentzian geometry , the distance between @xmath37 and a point on boundary of the light cone is zero , whereas in our setting it is undefined ( recall that the distance between two points @xmath37 is defined whenever we have @xmath46 ) . in conclusion , there are analogies between busemann s timelike theory and the geometric setting of relativity , but one has to be careful about several details .    equation ( [ eq : ff ] ) may be used as a definition of the funk metric @xmath72 .",
    "one advantage would be that in the case where @xmath19 is unbounded , it allows us to naturally extend the domain of definition for @xmath113 so that the light cone of a point @xmath37 is defined to be the set of points @xmath114 satisfying @xmath115 .",
    "we prove that the function @xmath72 satisfies the reverse triangle inequality , which we call in this context , after busemann , the _ time inequality_. this inequality holds for mutually distinct points @xmath75 and @xmath116 in @xmath36 , satisfying @xmath117 :    for any three points @xmath75 and @xmath116 in @xmath36 , satisfying @xmath117 , we have @xmath118    we use the formula ( [ eq : ff ] ) for the timelike funk distance .",

    "we shall refer to the paper @xcite for the corresponding results in the classical funk setting , and all the properties are motivated by busemann s work @xcite .",
    "first we consider geodesics for the timelike funk metric .",
    "we start with the definition of a geodesic .",
    "this definition is the same as in ordinary metric spaces , except that some care has to be taken so that the distances we need to deal with are always defined .",
    "a _ geodesic _ is a path @xmath121 , where @xmath122 may be an arbitrary interval of @xmath123 , such that for every pair @xmath124 in @xmath122 we have @xmath125 and for any triple @xmath126 in @xmath122 we have @xmath127    it follows easily from the definition that for any @xmath44 the euclidean segment @xmath65 $ ] joining @xmath37 to @xmath16 is the image of a geodesic .",
    "this makes the distance function @xmath113  projective \" in the sense of hilbert s fourth problem @xcite if this problem is extended in an appropriate way to timelike spaces . in particular , the time inequality becomes an equality when @xmath37 , @xmath16 and @xmath116 satisfying @xmath128 are collinear in the euclidean sense .",
    "let us make an observation which concerns the non - uniqueness of geodesics and the case of equality in the time inequality .",
    "assume that the boundary of the convex hypersurface @xmath19 contains a euclidean segment @xmath129 .",
    "take three points @xmath68 in a small neighborhood @xmath130 of a point on @xmath129 , such that the euclidean distance of @xmath68 to @xmath129 taken in that order is decreasing ( figure [ segment ] ) .",
    "then , using the euclidean intercept theorem , we have @xmath131 applying the same reasoning to an arbitrary ordered triple on the broken euclidean segment @xmath65\\cup[q , r]$ ] , we easily see that this segment is an @xmath113-geodesic .",
    "more generally , by the same argument , we see that _ any _ oriented arc in @xmath130 whose points get strictly closer to the segment @xmath129 when we move along this arc , is the image of an @xmath113-geodesic .    in fact",
    ", the situation in the neighborhood @xmath130 is very special .",
    "it is a case where the timelike funk and the classical funk metrics coincide , distances being defined from a fixed point @xmath37 to points in an open cone centered at this point .",
    "( notice that for this to happen , it is necessary that the time and the triangle inequalities hold , therefore they must both be equalities . )    from the preceding remarks on euclidean segments we can deduce the following :    a timelike funk metric @xmath113 defined on a set @xmath132 associated to a convex hypersurface @xmath19 in @xmath34 satisfies the following properties :    1 .   [ eucl1 ] the euclidean segments in @xmath36 that are of the form @xmath65 $ ] where @xmath44 are @xmath113-geodesics .",

    "the euclidean segments in ( [ eucl1 ] ) are the unique @xmath113-geodesic segments if and only if the convex set @xmath22 is strictly convex .",
    "the proof is the same as that of the equivalence between ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in corollary 8.7 of @xcite , up to reversing some of the inequalities ( i.e. replacing the triangle inequality by the time inequality ) .",

    "the proof is analogous to that of proposition 8.11 of @xcite , and we do not repeat it here .",
    "this proposition implies that some affine properties of the hypersurface @xmath19 are local invariants of the metric .",

    "several properties of the hyperbolic ( non - timelike ) funk metric proved in @xcite hold verbatim for this timelike hyperbolic funk metric . in particular , we have a variational formulation of the timelike hyperbolic funk metric : @xmath489    there is also a timelike hyperbolic hilbert metric , defined in an analogous way to the timelike hilbert metric defined in ",
