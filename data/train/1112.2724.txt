    "the investigation of strong correlation effects plays a major role in contemporary condensed matter research@xcite as , for example , in the field of high - temperature cuprate superconductors,@xcite heavy - fermion systems@xcite or frustrated magnetism.@xcite due to the complexity of the phenomena and the theoretical models there are still fundamental questions to be addressed , despite long and intensive research in these fields .    quite generally , the reason for this can be found in the presence of competing physical tendencies , whose characteristic energy scales are close together.@xcite then , a very rich variety of physical scenarios results since subtle differences in the external conditions or small parameter changes can tip the balance from one dominating mechanism to another .",
    "we consider the two - impurity anderson model@xcite ( tiam ) as one of the most basic models incorporating such competing interactions .",
    "there , two magnetic impurities are immersed with finite distance into a host with a noninteracting conduction band and hybridizations between conduction electrons and local interacting electrons .",
    "a single impurity is prone to the kondo effect,@xcite where an effective antiferromagnetic exchange between the conduction electrons and the local spin of the magnetic impurity leads to a dynamic spin - screening .",
    "this archetypical many - body effect is associated with an characteristic energy scale @xmath0 ( kondo scale ) which is nonanalytic and exponentially small in terms of the effective exchange .",
    "additionally , the noninteracting band electrons induce an effective magnetic exchange between the two impurities,@xcite known as the ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky)-interaction . this rkky - exchange can be ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic , depending on the spatial separation of the two impurities .",
    "the rkky - exchange is expected to be dominant for a small hybridization between the impurity and the conduction band and favors an inter - impurity coupling of the spins usually associated with long - ranged magnetic order .",
    "the kondo coupling , on the other hand , strongly increases toward larger hybridization strengths and promotes individual kondo effects at each impurity resulting in two uncoupled and screened impurities .",
    "this scenario proposed by doniach@xcite for the competition between these two mechanisms is at the heart of the rich variety observed in many physical systems.@xcite    the tiam as the simplest model for this competition has be studied intensively @xcite in the past and has been realized in a recent experiment.@xcite the thermodynamic properties of the model are governed by a quantum critical point separating the ordered and paramagnetic ( kondo ) ground states in case of identical impurities and particle - hole symmetry.@xcite however , the quantum critical point is unstable and turns into a crossover once one of these symmetries is broken or a direct hopping is included.@xcite the dynamic properties under general conditions , that is varying impurity - impurity distance , hybridization and interaction strength , are not as clear .",
    "especially the situation with finite non - diagonal hybridization is not well studied since usually the rkky exchange is simulated via a direct exchange interaction .    in this work we present an approach to the a general tiam which is formulated in the framework of direct perturbation theory in the hybridization@xcite which utilizes skeleton graphs for families of time ordered diagrams .",
    "these techniques have been laid out in the literature , e.g.  in connection with the kondo effect or the mixed valence problem,@xcite and have served to define approximation schemes of great usefulness and quality.@xcite    there have already been approaches to the tiam with these techniques,@xcite but these were restricted to infinite coulomb interaction , @xmath1 , neglected vertex corrections , and ignored non - diagonal ionic propagators ( see below for details ) .",
    "the present scheme is an extension of the finite-@xmath2 enhanced noncrossing approximation ( enca)@xcite , which improves on the well known noncrossing approximation ( nca)@xcite by the inclusion of low - order vertex corrections .",
    "it is also a direct extension of the enca for the multi - orbital situation as described in ref .  .",
    "apart from an application to the rich and interesting physics encountered in the tiam , our new two - impurity solver also is of interest for extensions of the dynamical mean - field theory to include nonlocal two - site correlations .",
    "compared to other existing two - impurity solvers the present scheme has some advantages as well as shortcomings : like all the schemes based on perturbation theory in the hybridization , it has some problems to correctly describe the fermi liquid properties at very low temperatures .",
    "this does not represent a major drawback as many scenarios and questions of current interest can be addressed at temperatures accessible within these schemes ( see , for example , ref .  ) . as will be demonstrated below and as it is known from the single - impurity case,@xcite",
    "these schemes correctly describe the non - perturbative kondo - physics and are able to reproduce the exponentially small low - energy kondo scale",
    ". additionally , there are no adjustable parameters and this theory is directly formulated for correlation functions at the real frequency axis this avoids the inaccuracies connected with a numerical analytic continuation of imaginary time data , as obtained , for example , from quantum monte carlo schemes .",
    "we consider two impurities ( labeled as @xmath3-electrons ) placed at at lattice sites @xmath4 with @xmath5 .",
    "that part of the hamiltonian preserving all local occupation numbers is @xmath6 the operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the usual annihilation and creation operators for impurity @xmath3-electrons with spin @xmath9 at the lattice @xmath10 and @xmath11 . the density - density coulomb interaction is incorporated via the matrix elements @xmath12 for on - site and @xmath13 for inter - site interaction .",
    "we also allow for more general couplings between the two impurities @xmath14 where the first term is direct single - particle hopping with amplitude @xmath15 and the second term a heisenberg exchange with exchange coupling @xmath16 and @xmath17 the vector @xmath3-electron spin operator .",
    "the third term allows , e.g. , correlated hopping ( associated with matrix element @xmath18 ) and pair - hopping ( associated with matrix element @xmath19 ) .",

    "both subsystems hybridize via a term @xmath26 the total hamiltonian then reads @xmath27    even though in principal there is no limitation in applying our calculational scheme to this model in full generality , in this work we will mostly consider identical impurities and focus on the half - filled particle - hole symmetric case , where two electrons are placed in the two - impurity cluster .",
    "the general idea of direct perturbation theory is to treat the two - impurity subsystem @xmath28 exactly and to use @xmath29 as the perturbation . with @xmath30",
    "the fock - space of @xmath3-electrons is diagonalized in terms of the local occupation numbers @xmath31 .",

    "these are exact equations if the exact vertex functions @xmath47 are used . in practice",
    ", however , the exact vertex functions are unknown and approximations for @xmath48 are employed .    for simplicity",
    ", we will confine our considerations to one - particle @xmath3-green functions where @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "for the two - impurity model the one - particle green function is conveniently written as a @xmath51 matrix for each spin component , @xmath52 a central quantity of physical interest is the one - particle spectral function which is given by the diagonal part of the green function , @xmath53 where the limit @xmath54 is implied .",
    "in contrast to what is commonly needed for ( effective ) single - impurity models,@xcite we introduced non - diagonal ionic propagators , @xmath55 which together with the diagonal components and the vertex functions @xmath56 are the central quantities of interest which need to be computed .",
    "the perturbational processes contributing to the ionic propagators and vertex functions take place along the imaginary time axis @xmath57 .",

    "the initial and final ionic state @xmath38 is displayed twice in graphical representations for clarity , but is included only once in the corresponding formulas .    as usual ,",
    "propagators are favorably built up from irreducible self - energies @xmath63 , which together with the vertex functions form a closed set of skeleton equations .",
    "diagrammatic contributions to the self - energies are identified as pieces of diagrams which can not be separated into disjoint parts by cutting only the time axis of each site in the cluster .",
    "it is important to realize here , that the time - ordered processes , generated by expanding the resolvents in eq .",
    "( [ eq:28 ] ) in terms of the hybridization @xmath29 , generally extend over all sites of the cluster .",
    "local pieces on one particular site @xmath10 can occur in proper time - order , either after an electron has is transferred from a different site @xmath64 or after an interaction process , both induced by @xmath36 . if @xmath36 would have been regarded as a perturbation , too , these events would appear in the diagrams explicitly .",
    "however , we will take @xmath36 into account exactly via a non - diagonal form of the ionic propagators @xmath65 , which corresponds to the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath66 .    as a consequence of the all - embracing unique time - order in the cluster",
    "only one energy variable is present after the laplace - transform .",
    "another consequence of this fact concerns the dynamical interdependence of local parts of a process in a cluster . as already mentioned , all events occur in a definite time - order .",
    "even if two processes happen to be located at separate impurities , e.g.  the excitation of two band electrons and re - absorption at the respective same site , different time - orderings of the individual two excitations and absorptions are counted separately in this approach .",
    "for example , interchanging the emission times of the two processes generates or removes one crossing of two band - electron lines . as the approximation is organized in numbers of crossing band electron lines higher - order vertex corrections with a multitude of crossing lines",
    "are not included .",
    "this introduces artificial inter - site correlations .",
    "therefore , all such approximations within a two - impurity model will in principle not faithfully reduce to two independent sites in the case of uncoupled impurities .",
    "they have to be thoroughly checked in the limiting case of two independent sites , where an ordinary kondo effect is expected at each site .",
    "as it turns out , the two - impurity solvers to be introduced below are capable of describing this limiting case reasonably well . on the other hand , these approximation schemes will perform even better when real physical inter - site correlations make it necessary to respect overall time order .",

    "is determined by simply including a factor of @xmath77 for each crossing of two band electron lines .",

    "<S> we present a novel approximation for the treatment of two interacting magnetic impurities immersed into a noninteracting metallic host . </S>",
    "<S> the scheme is based on direct perturbation theory with respect to the hybridization between the impurity and band electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this two - impurity enhanced noncrossing approximation can fully incorporate the indirect interactions between the impurities which are mediated by the conduction electrons as well as additional arbitrary direct interaction matrix elements . </S>",
    "<S> we qualify the approximation by investigating the uncoupled case and conclude the two - impurity approximation to be equally accurate as its single impurity counterpart . </S>",
    "<S> the physical properties of the two - impurity anderson model ( tiam ) are first investigated in some limiting cases . in a regime , where each of the uncoupled two impurities would exhibit a pronounced kondo effect </S>",
    "<S> , we ignore the indirect coupling via the conduction band and only incorporate direct interactions . for a ferromagnetic direct exchange coupling , </S>",
    "<S> the system displays a behavior similar to a spin - one kondo effect , while an antiferromagnetic coupling competes with the kondo effect and produces a pseudogap in the many - body kondo resonance of the single - particle spectral function . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a direct one - particle hopping also produces a pseudogap but additionally pronounced side - peaks emerge . </S>",
    "<S> this gap is characteristically different from the case with antiferromagnetic coupling , since it emerges as a consequence of distinct kondo effects for the bonding and anti - bonding orbital , i.e.  it reflects a splitting of even and odd parity states . for the general case of only indirect coupling via the conduction band </S>",
    "<S> the results show signatures of all the previously discussed limiting cases as function of the impurity - impurity distance . </S>",
    "<S> oscillatory behavior in physical quantities is to be expected due to the generated ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky)-interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we are led to the conclusion that the well known doniach - scenario captures essential aspects this model , but the details especially at small distances are more complicated . </S>"
