    "the fact that a uniformly accelerated observer in minkowski space perceives the minkowski vacuum as a thermal state with a temperature proportional to the acceleration is called the unruh effect in honour of its discoverer @xcite .",
    "it is the simplest among the phenomena linking thermal effects to spacetime horizons .",
    "other examples of such phenomena are thermalisation of de  sitter space as seen by inertial observers @xcite and the celebrated discovery by hawking of the thermal radiation surrounding black holes  @xcite .",
    "a conceptually straightforward way to address the unruh effect is in terms of a particle detector model , consisting of a quantum system with discrete energy levels and a weak coupling to the quantum field . in generic motion",
    "the detector will undergo transitions , which can be interpreted as due to absorption or emission of field quanta ; the particle content of the field is thus defined operationally by reference to the measurable excitations or de - excitations of the detector .",
    "the simplest model , originated by unruh @xcite and dewitt  @xcite , involves a linear coupling of the detector s monopole moment to the field at the detector s position .",
    "for the uniformly accelerated detector in minkowski vacuum this model exhibits the planckian spectrum for the ( infinite ) total transition probability divided by the ( infinite ) total proper time @xcite , under certain technical assumptions on handling the infinities .",
    "if the detector is allowed to move on an arbitrary ( timelike ) trajectory , the notion of transition probability becomes more subtle .",
    "as we will review in section  [ sec : detectormodels ] , the formal first - order perturbation theory expression for the instantaneous transition rate involves the distribution - valued wightman function of the quantum field in a way whose interpretation is ambiguous .",
    "schlicht @xcite observed that when the wightman function is represented by the ` standard ' @xmath0 regularisation in a given lorentz frame , the resulting instantaneous transition rate for a uniformly accelerated detector that has been switched on in the asymptotic past depends on the proper time of the detector ; a result that breaks lorentz invariance and appears thus physically incorrect .",
    "schlicht also showed that when the detector response is regularised by first giving the detector a specific spatial profile and then taking the point - like limit , the result is equivalent to giving the wightman function along the detector world line a non - standard regularisation .",
    "this nonstandard regularisation yields physically reasonable results for a number of trajectories , including the time - independent planckian transition rate for the uniformly accelerated detector @xcite .",
    "langlois @xcite observed that this regularisation can be alternatively interpreted as an exponential frequency cut - off in the detector s instantaneous rest frame , rather than in a fixed lorentz frame .    while schlicht s regularisation of the detector by a spatial profile thus appears physically reasonable , the results in @xcite for non - inertial motion rely on a specific choice for the profile function : the lorentzian function , given below in our  ( [ lorentzian ] ) .",
    "( for inertial motion , it was shown in @xcite that the response in minkowski vacuum is the same for any spherically symmetric profile . )",
    "further , the final transition rate formula in @xcite involves an integral of the _ regularised _ correlation function , and the regulator may be taken to zero only after the integration .",
    "such a formula can be readily applied to specific trajectories , at least numerically , but it does not provide a transparent starting point for extracting analytically properties of interest , such as asymptotic behaviour at large / small frequency or at early / late proper times .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to address the above two questions .",
    "we first compute the zero - size limit of schlicht s transition rate explicitly and show that it can be written as a manifestly finite integral formula that no longer involves regulators or limits .",
    "the result holds both for a detector switched on at a finite time and for a detector switched on in the asymptotic past , in the latter case subject to certain asymptotic conditions on the trajectory .",
    "we also show that the transition rate obtained from the ` standard ' @xmath0 regularisation of the wightman function in a given lorentz frame differs by an additive , lorentz - noninvariant term that is independent of the frequency and local as a function along the trajectory .",
    "this lorentz - noninvariant term agrees with the analytic and numerical observations made in the special case of uniform acceleration in  @xcite .",
    "second , we discuss a spatially extended detector model that uses a modified definition of spatial smearing .",
    "subject to mild technical conditions on both the detector profile and the trajectory , we show that the transition rate in this model is _ independent _ of the spatial profile and coincides with that obtained from the ( unmodified ) smearing with the lorentzian profile function .",
    "third , we use our transition rate formula to make certain observations on the parity and falloff properties of the detector response .",
    "finally , we examine a number of specific trajectories , including all the stationary worldlines in minkowski space and a selection of nonstationary worldlines with interesting asymptotics .",
    "we recover in particular the planckian spectrum for uniform acceleration , and for a motion interpolating between inertial and uniformly accelerated motion we obtain an appropriately interpolating transition rate .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : detectormodels ] with a brief review of the unruh - dewitt particle detector and its regularisation by a spatial profile .",
    "the zero - size limit of the transition rate regularised by the lorentzian profile function is computed in section  [ sec : lor - limit ] .",
    "the modified spatially extended detector model is analysed in section  [ sec : generalprofile ] .",
    "section [ sec : applications ] discusses the parity and falloff properties of the transition rate and presents the applications to specific trajectories .",
    "the results are summarised and discussed in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the proofs of certain technical results are deferred to two appendices .",
    "we work in four - dimensional minkowski spacetime with metric signature @xmath1 , and in units in which @xmath2 .",
    "boldface letters denote spatial three - vectors and sans - serif letters spacetime four - vectors .",
    "the euclidean scalar product of three - vectors @xmath3 and @xmath4 is denoted by @xmath5 , and the minkowski scalar product of four - vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 is denoted by @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 denotes a quantity for which @xmath10 is bounded as @xmath11 and @xmath12 a quantity that remains bounded when the parameter under consideration approaches zero .",
    "we begin by considering a detector that consists of an idealised , pointlike atom with two energy levels , denoted by @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which are eigenstates of the atomic hamiltonian @xmath15 with respective eigenvalues @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 .",
    "the detector is coupled to the real , massless scalar field @xmath19 at the position of the detector , with an interaction hamiltonian of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a coupling constant , @xmath22 is the atom s monopole moment operator and @xmath23 is the spacetime position of the atom parametrised by its proper time  @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is a smooth switching function , positive during the interaction and vanishing before and after the interaction .",
    "suppose that before the interaction the detector is in the state @xmath13 and the field in the state @xmath26 .",
    "after the interaction has taken place , the detector may have a nonzero probability to be in the state @xmath14 : for @xmath27 ( respectively @xmath28 ) , the transition of the detector is interpreted as the absorption ( emission ) of a particle of energy  @xmath17 . in first - order perturbation theory in the coupling constant  @xmath21 , this probability is @xcite @xmath29 where the response function @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 the response function @xmath30 encodes the part of the probability that depends on the trajectory but not on the detector s internal properties , while the prefactor that involves the matrix element @xmath32 depends on the detector s internal properties but not on the trajectory .",
    "we now specialise to four - dimensional minkowski spacetime @xmath33 and take the quantum state @xmath26 of the field to be the minkowski vacuum , denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "the wightman function @xmath35 is then a well - defined distribution on @xmath36 , and its pull - back to the detector world line , the correlation function @xmath37 is a well - defined distribution on @xmath38 @xcite . as long as the switching function @xmath25 is assumed smooth and of compact support , formula ( [ defresponse ] ) gives therefore an unambiguous definition to the response function  @xmath30 , and the probability ( [ eq : total - probability ] ) is that of observing the detector in the state @xmath14 after the interaction has ceased .",
    "we wish to address a related but subtly different question @xcite : what is the probability of finding the detector in the state @xmath14 _ while the interaction is still switched on ? _ proceeding for the moment formally , the answer should be obtained from ( [ eq : total - probability ] ) and ( [ defresponse ] ) by introducing in the switching function a sharp cut - off at the proper time @xmath24 at which the detector is observed , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the heaviside function .",
    "the modified response function @xmath41 then reads @xmath42 the physically interesting quantity in this situation is the instantaneous transition rate @xmath43 , where the overdot denotes derivative with respect to  @xmath24 .",
    "up to a proportionality constant , @xmath43 gives the number of transitions to the state @xmath14 per unit proper time in an ensemble of identical detectors following the trajectory  @xmath23 .",
    "differentiating ( [ defresponse - tau ] ) , using the identify @xmath44 and performing a change of variables in the remaining integral , we find @xmath45 if the switching function is taken to have a sharp switch - on at the initial time @xmath46 and to be unity thereafter , @xmath47 , ( [ defexcitation ] ) becomes @xmath48 for a detector switched on in the distant past , @xmath49 , we obtain @xmath50 as stressed by schlicht @xcite in the context of formula ( [ defexcitation - sharp - infty ] ) , all the expressions ( [ defresponse - tau])([defexcitation - sharp - infty ] ) are _ causal _ : the probability and the instantaneous transition rate are given by integrals over the _",
    "past _ of the detector trajectory .",
    "there is no need to specify what the trajectory will do after the moment the detector is read ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "now , the difficulty with formulas ( [ defresponse - tau])([defexcitation - sharp - infty ] ) is that each of them involves the correlation function @xmath51 in a way that is ambiguous .",
    "as @xmath51 is a distribution on @xmath38 @xcite , rather than a function , the problem first arises in ( [ defresponse - tau ] ) because @xmath51 is integrated against a function that is not smooth but has a discontinuity at the observation time . in ( [ defexcitation - sharp ] ) and",
    "( [ defexcitation - sharp - infty ] ) the problem is compounded respectively by the discontinuity of the switching function at the sharp switch - on time and the noncompact support of the switching function .    to see the ambiguity explicitly , recall that the formal mode sum expression for the wightman function reads @xmath52 where @xmath53 .",
    "the usual way to regularise this mode sum is by the frequency cut - off @xmath54 , where @xmath55 , leading to the representation @xcite @xmath56 assuming @xmath57 , expanding ( [ tradwightman ] ) into partial fractions and taking the limit in the sense of one - dimensional hilbert transforms yields @xmath58   \\right\\ }   \\ ,   \\label{dist}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 , @xmath60 and @xmath61 stands for the cauchy principal value .",
    "however , inserting the correlation function given by ( [ eq : w ] ) with ( [ dist ] ) into ( [ defexcitation ] ) gives an integral whose interpretation is ambiguous because @xmath62 and @xmath63 both vanish at @xmath64 .",
    "one is therefore led to seek a meaning for the instantaneous transition rates in ( [ defexcitation])([defexcitation - sharp - infty ] ) by first regularising  @xmath51 , then doing the integral over @xmath65 and at the end removing the regulator .",
    "however , there is now an issue as to which regularisation to use .",
    "the wightman function is a well - defined , lorentz - invariant distribution , and it can be defined as @xmath66   - \\epsilon^2 } \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath67 is _ any _ global time function that increases to the future  @xcite .",
    "the usual representation ( [ tradwightman ] ) is obtained with the choice @xmath68 in a specific lorentz frame .",
    "but when the wightman function , or the correlation function @xmath51 obtained from it , is used outside the distributional setting , there is no a priori guarantee for different time functions in ( [ covwightman ] ) to lead to the same results , nor is there a guarantee for the results to be lorentz invariant .",
    "the transition rate formulas ( [ defexcitation - sharp ] ) and ( [ defexcitation - sharp - infty ] ) are a case in point : schlicht @xcite observed that when used in  ( [ defexcitation - sharp - infty ] ) , the usual wightman function regularisation ( [ tradwightman ] ) yields for the uniformly accelerated detector a result that is not invariant under the lorentz boosts that leave the trajectory invariant . we show in appendix [ app : ieps ] that the only trajectories for which the usual wightman function regularisation ( [ tradwightman ] ) yields a lorentz - invariant result for the transition rates ( [ defexcitation - sharp ] ) and ( [ defexcitation - sharp - infty ] ) are the inertial trajectories .",
    "if we insist on a lorentz - invariant transition rate , the usual regularisation ( [ tradwightman ] ) will therefore not do .",
    "schlicht @xcite proposed to regularise the transition rate by giving the detector a finite spatial extent in its instantaneous rest frame .",
    "the idea is that the detector is not coupled to the field operator on the detector world line , @xmath69 , but instead to the spatially smeared field operator , @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a set of fermi - walker coordinates associated with the trajectory : @xmath72 , where @xmath73 are three unit vectors that together with the velocity @xmath74 form an orthonormal tetrad , fermi - walker transported with the motion  @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath75-coordinates parametrise the hyperplane orthogonal to the velocity at each moment of proper time .",
    "the profile function @xmath76 is assumed normalised so that @xmath77 , to depend on a positive parameter @xmath78 so that @xmath79 , and to have the scaling property @xmath80 the function @xmath81 thus gives the detector s  shape , \" which is rigid in the detector s instantaneous rest frame , and the positive parameter @xmath78 determines the detector s `` size . ''",
    "if the transition rate of a detector smeared in this way is well defined and has a well - defined limit as @xmath82 , this limit can then be understood as the transition rate of a pointlike detector .",
    "the correlation function for the smeared field operator ( [ smeared ] ) is defined by @xmath83 when the function @xmath81 in ( [ eq : profile - scaling ] ) is the lorentzian function , @xmath84 schlicht @xcite shows that @xmath85 where the unprimed and primed quantities on the right - hand side are evaluated respectively at @xmath24 and  @xmath86 .",
    "note that @xmath87 ( [ corrschlicht ] ) is manifestly lorentz covariant because of the four - velocities appearing with  @xmath78 .",
    "schlicht examines @xcite the transition rate ( [ defexcitation - sharp - infty ] ) for a detector switched on in the asymptotic past using @xmath87 ( [ corrschlicht ] ) for a number of trajectories and finds results that appear physically sensible .",
    "in particular , the transition rate of a uniformly accelerated detector has the expected @xmath24-independent planckian spectrum of the unruh effect , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the acceleration .",
    "schlicht s results have been generalised by p.  langlois @xcite to a variety of situations , including minkowski space in an arbitrary number of dimensions , quotients of minkowski space under discrete isometry groups , the massive scalar field , the massless dirac field and certain curved spacetimes .",
    "these results of schlicht and langlois rely on the choice of the lorentzian profile function , given in four dimensions by ( [ lorentzian ] ) and in other dimensions by the appropriate generalisation  @xcite . for the inertial detector switched on in the asymptotic past",

    "is constant in time , and the total transition probability is again infinite , now owing to the infinite amount of time elapsed in the past . in these situations",
    "one may therefore have reason to view our results , all of which were obtained within first - order perturbation theory , as suspect , and perhaps even to question the whole notion of the instantaneous transition rate .",
    "however , in situations where the detector is switched on in the asymptotic past of infinite proper time and the total probability of excitation ( @xmath27 ) is finite , the first - order perturbation theory result should be reliable at least for the excitation rate , although the total probability of de - excitation ( @xmath28 ) then still diverges .",
    "two examples of this situation , with an acceleration that vanishes asymptotically in the past , were found in section  [ sec : applications ] .    when the total excitation probability is finite , it has a directly observable meaning as the fraction of detectors that have become excited in an ensemble that is initially prepared in the state @xmath13 and follows the trajectory  @xmath23 .",
