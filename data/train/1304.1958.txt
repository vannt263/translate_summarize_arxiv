    "understanding the properties and structure of nucleon resonances is a key issue in hadron physics . up to now",
    ", the status of our knowledge of nucleon resonance is still not satisfying . besides the parameters of nucleon resonance , such as mass and width ,",
    "still have large uncertainties , the couplings of @xmath1 with various channels are also not very well known .",
    "currently , our knowledge of nucleon resonance is mainly from the analysis of @xmath1 production processes in @xmath2 or @xmath3 reactions , where the nucleon resonances which have large couplings to @xmath2 or @xmath3 channels are more easily detected .",
    "it is believed that lacking measurements with probes different from pion beam is a possible reason for the so - called `` missing resonance '' problem . in the particle data group ( pdg ) book@xcite",
    ", it is shown that the couplings of nucleon resonances with @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 channels are relatively well - known .",
    "for other channels , especially for the @xmath5 and @xmath6 channels , our knowledge is still poor . in the pdg summary table for the @xmath1s",
    ", only one @xmath1 state is ranked as three stars state for its coupling with @xmath5 or @xmath6 channels , which means `` not well determined '' . for other states , their couplings with strange particles",
    "are only ranked as two or one star , which means the knowledge of their couplings is still very poor .",
    "on theoretical side , the couplings of @xmath1s with strange particles may give important implications about the internal structures of nucleon resonances .",
    "in ref.@xcite , the authors argued that the @xmath7 is a @xmath8 molecular state . in this picture ,",
    "large couplings of the @xmath7 with the @xmath6 and @xmath5 channels are expected@xcite . in another work@xcite",
    ", the authors argued that , if the @xmath7 has a large coupling to @xmath5 channel , the @xmath7 may have large five quark component .",
    "it is obvious that better knowledge of the couplings of nucleon resonances with strange particles is important for understanding the structure of nucleon resonance and verifying various theoretical models .    in recent years , besides @xmath2 and @xmath3 reactions , some other processes such as @xmath9 collision experiments and @xmath10 decay are also used to investigate the property of nucleon resonances . these new experimental data",
    "together with @xmath2 and @xmath3 scattering data constitute a better basis for studying nucleon resonances .",
    "some significant improvements have been achieved along this way . with these achievements , one interesting question will be whether there is some other reaction also suitable for studying nucleon resonance . in this work ,",
    "we want to discuss the possibility of studying nucleon resonance in the @xmath0 interaction .",
    "in fact , in the 1960 s and 1970 s , there were some experimental studies of nucleon resonance production in the @xmath0 interactions@xcite .",
    "however , with the experimental data with very low statistics at that time , no significant achievements were obtained . on the theoretical side ,",
    "no systematic studies on this topic have been done either .",
    "our knowledge of the reaction mechanisms of these processes is very poor .",
    "thanks to the pioneering works in the nucleon resonance production in nucleon nucleon collision reactions and the @xmath0 elastic scattering reactions , it is possible to make some theoretical predictions for the nucleon resonance production in the @xmath0 interactions . based on isobar resonance model , we investigate the reaction mechanisms of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 reactions@xcite .",
    "it is found that the hyperon exchange may play an important role for the excitations of the nucleon resonances in these reactions .",
    "therefore , the process of nucleon resonance production in the @xmath0 interactions may offer a good place to investigate the coupling of nucleon resonance with strange particles .",
    "second row : feynman diagrams for @xmath13 . ]    in our work , we adopt the isobar resonance model to study the nucleon resonance production in the @xmath0 interactions .",
    "the interactions among particles are described by the effective lagrangians . in our model ,",
    "the nucleon resonance production in the @xmath0 interactions can be depicted by the feynman diagrams shown in the first row in fig.[feynfig1 ] .",
    "if we ignore the decay of the nucleon resonance for this moment , these two diagrams correspond to @xmath14channel and @xmath15channel diagrams , respectively .",
    "therefore , one may expect that the final kaon will show different pattern of angular distributions if @xmath14channel or @xmath15channel diagram dominates this reaction .",
    "this feature offers the possibility for identifying the reaction mechanism by analyzing the angular distributions of final particles .",
    "here we do not consider the @xmath16channel diagram because there is no clear evidence of the existence of pentaquark state . for comparison",
    ", we also show the corresponding feynman diagram for nucleon resonance production in nn collision reaction . in resonance model , both these two processes are dominated by the excitation of nucleon resonance in resonance production energy region . while , in the @xmath0 interactions , pseudoscalar meson exchange is forbidden and hyperon exchange is allowed . for @xmath9 collision reactions ,",
    "pseudoscalar meson exchange is allowed and hyperon exchange is forbidden . therefore , the studies of both these two processes can help us know better about the excitation mechanisms of nucleon resonance . in this sense ,",
    "the studies in these two processes are complementary . as two examples , we present some detailed discussion for the @xmath17 and the @xmath18 reactions .      for the reaction @xmath17",
    ", we consider three different charge channels , i.e. @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "all these three channels can be depicted by the feynman diagrams shown in fig.[feynfig1 ] , where the nucleon and nucleon resonance should be replaced by the corresponding charge states and the nucleon resonance is decaying to the corresponding @xmath22 channel .",
    "it should be noted that , due to the charge conservation law , the allowed exchanging particles between initial states are different for different charge channels . because we are only interested in the energy region near threshold , we assume that these reactions are dominated by the excitation of @xmath7 in the intermediate state .",
    "this assumption is reasonable because there is no other resonance which gives a significant contribution near threshold@xcite . in our model , @xmath23 exchange",
    "is also ignored since it was found that the @xmath23 exchange only plays a minor role for the excitation of @xmath7 in the reaction @xmath24@xcite .",
    "if our assumptions are correct , this reaction may be a good place to investigate the properties of @xmath7 .",
    "next , we will present the results based on the calculations of the corresponding feynman diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ feynfig1 ] , which can be obtained by following the standard procedures . for more detailed information about the calculations",
    ", please refer to ref.@xcite .",
    "the main findings of our work are :    1",
    ".   hyperon exchange may give important contributions in these reactions .",
    "2 .   the hyperon exchange and meson exchange induce different pattern of angular distributions of final particles .",
    "3 .   the relative roles of individual meson or hyperon exchanges change in different channels , thus a combined analysis of all these reactions may put strong constraints on the model and help us know better about the couplings of @xmath7 with strange particles .      as for the reaction @xmath18 , we consider the @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 excitations in the intermediate states . for the corresponding feynman diagrams",
    ", we still use the diagrams shown in the first row in fig .",
    "[ feynfig1 ] , where the nucleon and nucleon resonance represent the corresponding charge states considered in this reaction and the nucleon resonance is decaying to @xmath28 channel . in principle ,",
    "@xmath29 and @xmath30 exchanges also contribute .",
    "however , because of the very poor knowledge of the couplings of nucleon resonances with the @xmath6 and @xmath31 channels , we ignore their contributions . within isobar model , we calculate the corresponding feynman diagrams(see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) and the main results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "our results show that the @xmath32 exchange gives dominant contributions in lower energies(@xmath333gev ) and the @xmath34 exchange plays the dominant role in higher energies(@xmath355gev ) .",
    "2 .   in the present model",
    ", the @xmath26 gives the dominant contributions in the whole energy region .",
    "because the @xmath36 vertex can appear twice in the @xmath15channel diagram , this reaction is a good place to study the nucleon resonances which have large couplings to the @xmath5 channel and is also suitable to look for missing resonances .",
    "it should be noted that in the present model we reproduce the few available data by adjusting some model parameters .",
    "this means that although in the present model we can describe the available data quite well , adjusting the parameters in a reasonable range there is still room for including some other nucleon resonances , for which their couplings to @xmath5 channel are still not well - known . within our model , it is shown that @xmath26 plays the most important role in this reaction because of its large coupling to @xmath5 channel .",
    "this observation supports the argument that this reaction is possibly a good place to study the nucleon resonance which has large coupling to @xmath5 channel . to my best knowledge",
    ", the subprocess @xmath37 of this reaction can not be observed by experiment directly .",
    "so the reaction @xmath18 offers a unique place to study the nucleon resonances that have large couplings to @xmath5 channel and to look for missing resonances .",
    "studying nucleon resonance in the @xmath0 interactions is also a potentially good way to study the nucleon resonances which have large couplings to @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath31 channels . if we consider the vector meson decay channel of the nucleon resonances(see fig .",
    "[ feynfig1 ] ) , the @xmath1-n - vector meson vertex can appear twice in the @xmath14channel diagram .",
    "this feature makes those reactions be suitable for studying nucleon resonances which couple strongly to vector meson channels .",
    "based on our model calculations , it is found that the hyperon exchange may play an important role in the nucleon resonance production in the @xmath0 interactions , which makes the @xmath0 scattering experiment a potentially good way to study the couplings of nucleon resonances with strange particle channel . until now",
    ", this topic is only very poorly studied in both theoretical and experimental aspects . to improve our knowledge of the couplings of nucleon resonances with @xmath5 and @xmath6 channels ,",
    "which is rather poorly known , we think the topic of this work deserves further studies .",
    "furthermore , it will also be interesting to investigate the couplings of nucleon resonances with vector mesons in the @xmath0 interactions .",
