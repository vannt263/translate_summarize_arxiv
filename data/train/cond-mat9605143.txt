    "the main obstacle to understanding two - dimensional doped antiferromagnets has been the inadequacy of current analytical and numerical tools when applied to these systems .",
    "a number of analytical approaches are available which work well in either high dimensions ( such as dynamical mean field theory@xcite ) or one dimension ( such as bosonization@xcite ) , but not in two dimensions .",
    "numerical approaches such as quantum monte carlo@xcite and exact diagonalization@xcite have been very useful , but quantum monte carlo suffers from a sign problem at low temperatures@xcite , and exact diagonalization can only be applied to small clusters .",
    "recently , however , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) techniques have been developed which allow one to obtain accurate , detailed information about ground state expectation values on significantly larger clusters@xcite .",
    "we have performed dmrg calculations on a variety of @xmath0-@xmath1 clusters .",
    "we have been able to treat systems of width 3 and 4 at a variety of dopings , with lengths up to 32 sites . at low doping , we have results from wider systems , such as @xmath6 . here",
    "we examine the structure of the ground state of @xmath0-@xmath1 clusters doped with one or two holes .",
    "specifically , we have calculated the ground state expectation value of the spin @xmath7 and the exchange field @xmath8 around a dynamic hole or pair of holes .",
    "we have also calculated the spatial kinetic energy distribution of one or two holes in a cluster , the spatial kinetic energy distribution of one hole when a second hole has been projected onto a particular site , and the hole - hole correlation function in a two - hole state . from these calculations",
    "one obtains new insight into the nature of the structures holes can induce in an antiferromagnetic host and the origin of pair binding seen in some clusters . in a subsequent paper",
    "we will discuss the effect of additional holes and present results for pairing correlations on long two , three , and four chain ladders .",
    "we first describe a simple theoretical framework for understanding hole motion in a @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "the hamiltonian is@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes nearest - neighbor sites , @xmath11 is a spin index , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are electron spin and creation operators , @xmath14 , and the gutzwiller projector @xmath15 excludes configurations with doubly occupied sites . in the calculations shown here",
    ", we set the hopping @xmath16 and the exchange @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath18 be the ground state of a particular @xmath0-@xmath1 system with @xmath19 sites and @xmath20 electrons .",
    "define a hole projection operator for site @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath23 projects out the part of a wavefunction in which site @xmath21 is vacant .",
    "although we call this vacant site a `` hole '' , there is not necessarily any spin associated with the vacancy : in the one dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model , for example , there is not .",
    "a better term might be `` dynamic vacancy '' , but the use of the term `` hole '' has now become fairly standard . in some systems , such as even - leg ladders ,",
    "an extra spin-@xmath24 is bound to the vacant site , forming a composite object with charge and spin , which is sometimes called a `` quasiparticle '' .",
    "we define an operator @xmath25 , which projects out a particular configuration of @xmath26 holes , as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , and @xmath29 .",
    "we can then separate @xmath18 into parts with specified hole locations as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a normalized wavefunction with holes at the specified sites , and @xmath32 .",
    "the ground state energy is given by @xmath33 the first term we refer to as the exchange energy , denoted by @xmath34 .",
    "the second term in eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) , the hopping energy or kinetic energy , can be written as @xmath35 where the hole configurations @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the same , except that @xmath36 has a hole at site @xmath38 and @xmath37 has one at site @xmath21 .",
    "in general , we consider two hole configurations @xmath36 and @xmath37 _ adjacent _ if they differ by a near - neighbor hop of a single hole .",
    "define the hopping overlap between @xmath36 and @xmath37 as @xmath39 clearly a necessary condition for @xmath40 to be nonzero is that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are adjacent , in which case only one pair of sites @xmath21 , @xmath38 appears in the sum .",
    "if @xmath36 and @xmath37 differ only in the position of hole @xmath26 , @xmath41 , then @xmath42 it is easy to see that @xmath43 . the kinetic energy can be written as @xmath44    we see that we can view the ground state as the result of a set of coupled variational calculations , where the exchange energy of each wavefunction @xmath45 is minimized , subject to having as much overlap as possible with adjacent hole configurations . for @xmath46 ,",
    "the interplay between the kinetic and exchange terms is interesting . in the low doping regime , since there are more exchange terms which come into play , the bulk spin behavior is dominated by exchange .",
    "close to any holes , however , since @xmath46 , substantial modifications of the local spin arrangements can occur . at higher doping ,",
    "the bulk spin behavior can be changed substantially as well .",
    "using dmrg , we can study @xmath45 directly : we calculate @xmath18 , and then measure operators of the form @xmath47 ( or @xmath48 ) , normalizing by @xmath49 .",
    "it is useful to use @xmath50 , where @xmath21 and @xmath38 are near a hole or pair of holes .",
    "this measurement gives us a `` snapshot '' of the spin configuration around a dynamic hole .",
    "if this expectation value is close to @xmath51 for two sites @xmath21 and @xmath38 , we say that there is a `` singlet bond '' connecting @xmath21 and @xmath38 , even if there is no term in the hamiltonian directly coupling @xmath21 and @xmath38 .",
    "we use the terms `` antiferromagnetic bond '' , `` valence bond '' , or just `` bond '' simply to indicate that @xmath52 .",
    "of course , nel order makes weak `` bonds '' connecting widely separated sites on opposite sublattices , but we will be particularly concerned here with bonds connecting nearby sites on the _ same _ sublattice .    we can also take a snapshot of the spin configuration using @xmath53 , for a single hole on an even number of sites . in that case , the ground state is degenerate with @xmath54 , so that the expectation value of @xmath7 in one of the ground states is finite .",
    "one can also project out some of the holes , and use @xmath55 , to find out where the unprojected holes are , or @xmath56 , to study their motion .",
    "the results in this paper were all calculated using the finite system version of dmrg@xcite , keeping track of transformation matrices to construct the initial guess for each superblock diagonalization@xcite . from 200 to 800 states",
    "were kept per block , with 800 states necessary for the @xmath2 system .",
    "we performed hundreds or thousands of measurements for each system . ordinarily storing all the operators needed to measure so many quantities would greatly increase the memory used by the program , but since the transformation matrices contain a complete description of the approximate wavefunction produced by the dmrg algorithm , the measurements could be performed at the end of the calculation , in manageable groups of 50 to 100 .",
    "the large number of measurements , at worst , doubled or tripled the computation time .      as a warmup exercise ,",
    "consider the 1d @xmath0-@xmath1 model , with one hole .",
    "one might consider as a variational ansatz for @xmath45 a nel arrangement of the electron spins , with one electron removed . in this ansatz",
    "we have made a `` quasiparticle '' , since an extra spin @xmath24 is associated with the hole .",
    "however , this is a very poor ansatz : @xmath45 has no overlap with @xmath57 .",
    "alternatively , one can arrange the spins as shown in fig .",
    "1(a ) , with shifted nel arrangements separated by the hole@xcite .",
    "there are two spin wavefunctions @xmath45 , plus translations : for @xmath36 odd ( even ) , an up spin is to the left of the hole , while for @xmath36 even ( odd ) , a down spin is to the left of the hole . in this case",
    "there is complete overlap , and the kinetic energy associated with the hole takes on the maximal ( in magnitude ) value @xmath58 .",
    "this is a simple intuitive argument for spin  charge separation in a 1d @xmath0-@xmath1 model . since a single hole moves freely",
    ", it also suggests that there is no kinematic reason for the binding of pairs of holes , although for unphysically large @xmath59 the diagonal term in eq.([energy ] ) can cause binding .",
    "a justification for considering these nel configurations for the 1d @xmath0-@xmath1 model is the existence of power - law decaying antiferromagnetic correlations in the 1d heisenberg model .",
    "bond - bond correlations @xmath60 also decay as a power law , suggesting a valence bond configuration as a complementary ansatz : valence bonds occupy odd ( even ) links to the left of the hole , and even ( odd ) links to the right , as shown in fig .",
    "if one takes this configuration , and applies @xmath61 to move the hole to a neighboring site , one obtains the configuration in fig .",
    "1(c ) , with a valence bond straddling the hole . consequently , if we let the valence bond configuration of fig .",
    "1(b ) define @xmath45 for all odd sites @xmath36 , and let the configuration of fig .",
    "1(c ) define @xmath45 for all even sites , then the hole moves freely , with the kinetic energy taking on its maximal value @xmath58 .    in fig .",
    "1(d)-(e ) , we show dmrg results for the bond strength @xmath50 for a single hole in a 15 site 1d chain , with open boundary condtions . the width of the line corresponding to each bond has been made proportional to the bond strength , as indicated by the scale in the box .",
    "the maximum possible bond strength is @xmath62 .",
    "the boundaries induce dimerization in the system , and the results are quite similar to the valence bond configurations shown in fig .",
    "1(b)-(c ) .",
    "it is also possible to obtain results which look like fig .",
    "1(a ) . in fig .",
    "1(f ) , we show results for the @xmath63 ground state of a system with an even number of sites and one hole .",
    "the excess spin @xmath24 is spread out over the lattice .",
    "particularly interesting is the strength of the bond across the hole in fig .",
    "in order to maximize the hopping overlap with adjacent hole configurations , in addition to having antiferromagnetic correlations on nearest - neighbor links , we expect such correlations between _ next - nearest - neighbor _ sites @xmath21 and @xmath38 if there is a hole at site @xmath64 which is a nearest - neighbor to both @xmath21 and @xmath38 . such a valence bond becomes a nearest - neighbor link after one hop of the hole to either site , since moving the hole also moves the bond .",
    "for example , suppose the hole configuration @xmath36 has a hole at site @xmath64 , with @xmath21 and @xmath38 nearest - neighbor sites to @xmath64 .",
    "let @xmath37 be the hole configuration after the hole hops from @xmath64 to @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath38 and @xmath64 are nearest - neighbor sites , we expect a strong antiferromagnetic bond between these sites in @xmath65 . in order to maximize the hopping overlap @xmath40",
    ", there will also be a strong antiferromagnetic bond between sites @xmath21 and @xmath38 in @xmath45 .",
    "this tendency applies to two dimensions as well as one , and appears as an essential ingredient for pair binding in ladders and two dimensions .",
    "we now consider a two chain ladder system , with identical couplings along the legs and rungs , @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "we consider first a single hole . in fig .",
    "2(a ) we show bond strengths in @xmath45 in the vicinity of the dynamic hole for a @xmath66 lattice , with @xmath36 on site @xmath67 . as we argued above",
    ", the system has a tendency to form antiferromagnetic correlations on next - nearest - neighbor sites around the hole . except in one dimension",
    ", this tendency introduces _ frustration _ , since sites on the same sublattice tend to be parallel .",
    "a single heisenberg spin chain becomes dimerized for sufficiently large frustrating next - nearest neighbor interaction ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "similar dimerization is clearly evident in the two bonds above the hole fig .",
    "the dimerization weakens one of the nearest - neighbor bonds around the hole sufficiently to allow two of the next - nearest - neighbor links to form antiferromagnetic correlations . since the hole is not quite at the center of the system , the figure need not be symmetric .    a single heisenberg spin chain with frustrating next - nearest neighbor interaction @xmath69 develops incommensurate , spiral spin correlations , in addition to dimerization@xcite .",
    "we have looked for this in @xmath45 by measuring @xmath70 , where the hole was on site ( 16,1 ) and the spin operators @xmath21 , @xmath38 , @xmath64 , and @xmath71 were for sites ( 15,1 ) , ( 15,2 ) , ( 17,2 ) , and ( 17,1 ) , respectively .",
    "no enhancement of this quantity by the presence of the hole was found , nor was any found in the other lattices we studied here .",
    "however , it still might occur@xcite in other parameter regimes , such as @xmath72 .    unlike the single chain heisenberg model",
    ", the undoped two chain ladder does not have gapless spin @xmath24 excitations .",
    "spin - charge separation does not occur in the two chain ladder , and an extra up or down spin is bound to a single hole , forming a quasiparticle .",
    "it is not possible to specify a precise location for the extra spin , since every spin fluctuates between up and down , but one can get some indication of its whereabouts by measuring @xmath73 . in fig .",
    "2(b ) we show this quantity for the same @xmath45 shown in fig .",
    "2(a ) , in which the extra spin points up .",
    "clearly the extra spin is localized close to the hole , spending most of the time on the same rung as the hole .",
    "short - range antiferromagnetic correlations cause @xmath74 to be negative for some of the nearby sites .    in fig .",
    "2(c)-(d ) we show similar results for a _ static _ hole@xcite . in this case",
    "we remove one site , find the ground state , and measure its properties . in fig .",
    "2(c ) we see that there is no dimerization of the bonds above the vacancy , and no antiferromagnetic correlations between next - nearest - neighbor sites . in fig .",
    "2(d ) , we see that the extra spin is still mostly on the same rung as the static hole , but there is substantially more antiferromagnetic polarization caused by the extra spin . for a dynamic hole ,",
    "this polarization is mostly absent because it reduces the overlap between adjacent hole configurations , since it is tied to the hole location .",
    "the addition of a static hole increases the total exchange energy of the system , including the @xmath75 term , by @xmath76 .",
    "the frustrating effects of a dynamic hole further increase the total exchange energy by @xmath77 , but the kinetic energy associated with the dynamic hole is @xmath78 .",
    "next we consider the two chain system with two holes , which bind to form a pair . in fig .",
    "3(a ) we show the expectation value of the kinetic energy on each bond , when the location of only one of the holes has been specified with the projection operator @xmath25 .",
    "this provides information not only on where the other hole is , but between which sites it hops the most .",
    "we see that the other hole spends most of its time on the opposite chain , close to the first hole .",
    "what fraction of the time the other hole spends on each of the sites is obtained from @xmath49 with both locations specified .",
    "we find if the first hole is at ( 16,1 ) , the probability for finding the other on ( 15,2 ) , ( 16,2 ) , or ( 17,2 ) , is about 0.15 , for ( 14,2 ) or ( 18,2 ) , about 0.075 , and for ( 15,1 ) or ( 17,1 ) , about 0.055 .",
    "the second hole spends more total time on the _ two _ sites a distance @xmath79 away from the first hole than on the _ three _ nearest - neighbors sites .",
    "the probability is over 0.99 that the other hole is within a distance of 6 of the first hole .",
    "hole - hole density correlation functions have been calculated using lanczos methods for two holes on clusters ranging from @xmath80@xcite up to @xmath81@xcite , and using green s function monte carlo techniques on an @xmath82 cluster@xcite .",
    "it has been estimated that @xmath59 must be larger than @xmath83 for pair binding to occur@xcite .",
    "near - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor diagonal hole - hole correlations are dominant for @xmath84 . based on the @xmath81 results@xcite , for @xmath85",
    "the holes are about 20% more likely to be found across a diagonal than on near - neighbor sites . for @xmath59",
    "greater than about @xmath86 , the near - neighbor correlation exceeds the diagonal one .    in fig .",
    "3(b)-(d ) we show the bond strengths when the dynamic holes are in three possible configurations .",
    "the exchange energy of @xmath31 , compared to the system without holes , is 1.45@xmath0 for ( b ) , 1.71@xmath0 for ( c ) , and 1.92@xmath0 for ( d ) . despite these energies",
    ", the system spends as much time in configuration ( d ) as in ( b ) , and much more time in either of these than in ( c ) .",
    "configuration ( d ) is favored , despite its high exchange energy , because it connects with more hole configurations @xmath37 than does ( b ) or ( c ) , giving it more weight in the kinetic part of the energy .",
    "there are six configurations @xmath37 connected to ( d ) , but only four to ( b ) or ( c ) ( counting hops of either hole ) .    perhaps the most remarkable aspect of fig .",
    "3 is the very strong next - nearest - neighbor singlet bond crossing the holes in fig .",
    "3(d ) . for four of the six hops available to ( d )",
    ", this bond becomes a nearest - neighbor bond , and in each of those neighboring configurations the bond is quite strong .",
    "therefore , the kinetic term strongly favors a singlet bond connecting these sites .    on the @xmath87 system ,",
    "the kinetic energy of a pair of holes is -4.57 , compared with -4.74 for two separate holes .",
    "the increase in exchange energy caused by a pair of holes is 2.06 , compared with 2.51 for two separate holes .",
    "thus the slight increase in kinetic energy from binding a pair of holes is more than made up for by a substantial decrease in exchange energy .",
    "the pair binding energy , defined as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the ground states energy with @xmath26 holes , is @xmath90 .    it is useful to define the _ frustration energy _ associated with a particular hole configuration @xmath36 as @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the ground state in the static hole configuration @xmath36 .",
    "the frustration energy of two separate holes on the @xmath87 is @xmath93 . for two holes in configurations ( b ) , ( c ) , and ( d ) ,",
    "the frustration energies are 0.077@xmath0 , 0.249@xmath0 , and 0.066@xmath0 , respectively , much less than for separate holes .",
    "the frustration energy associated with the strong diagonal frustrating bond in ( d ) is rather small .",
    "this reflects the fact that a free @xmath94 forms on the end of a two chain heisenberg ladder with one extra site on one chain @xcite , and this extra spin can be used to form the diagonal singlet bond .",
    "we next consider a three chain ladder system with a single hole . in fig .",
    "4(a ) we show the kinetic energy on each link in a @xmath95 system , for sites near the center of the system .",
    "it is clear that the hole resides mostly on the outer legs , and that when it does hop onto a center - leg site , it is most likely to then hop to an outer leg . in fig .",
    "4(b ) we show the exchange energy on each link near a mobile hole in the state @xmath45 with @xmath36 on an outer leg near the center of the system .",
    "the expected next - nearest neighbor antiferromagnetic bond has formed across the hole .",
    "the dimerization is quite different than in the two - chain case : it forms in the vertical direction , where it is both more effective at accomodating the frustration and less costly in energy .",
    "the dimerized bonds form a structure resembling a short two - leg ladder . in fig .",
    "4(c ) we show similar results for the hole on the adjacent center - leg site . a particularly strong singlet bond forms across the hole , reflecting a strong tendency to hop vertically . fig .",
    "4(d ) shows @xmath96 on sites about the hole of fig .",
    "the pattern strongly resembles that of a single chain . instead of being localized near the hole , the extra @xmath94 is distributed about the system , indicating spin - charge separation .",
    "the spins form a one - dimensional shifted - nel configuration . on the same leg as the hole ,",
    "the other two sites are bound tightly into a singlet , and @xmath96 is very small .",
    "4(e ) shows similar results for the hole on the center leg .",
    "the frustration energy of a single hole on an outer leg on three chains is 0.19@xmath0 , and on the center leg , 0.68@xmath0 .",
    "two holes on a long three - chain ladder with @xmath3 are not bound .",
    "the density of holes has two widely spaced broad peaks .",
    "4(f ) shows the kinetic energy of one hole when the other hole is projected onto a site at one of the peaks in the density .",
    "direct measurement of the hole - hole correlation function shows that the hole is found exactly where the kinetic energy is large .",
    "why are two holes bound on two chains and not on three chains ?",
    "this is what one would expect based on arguments using an rvb variational ansatz for the background spin system@xcite .",
    "however , those arguments are based on a static treatment of holes , and as we have seen here , for @xmath3 the holes can not be treated statically .",
    "the rvb ansatz , as well as various analytical approaches@xcite , predicts the existence of free spinon excitations on ladders with odd numbers of legs , and this is important . in the three chain system",
    "a hole can separate into a hole and a free , zero - energy spinon , which one would expect to have lower energy .",
    "it is interesting to compare fig .",
    "4(b ) and fig .",
    "2(a ) : on three chains , a low energy local spin structure can form involving vertical dimerization which allows easy hopping . on two chains ,",
    "vertical dimerization is not possible , and the bonds above the hole also carry the extra @xmath94 , reducing their strength .",
    "direct comparison of the energies supports this picture : on a @xmath95 system , adding one hole ( and spinon ) increases the exchange energy by 1.19@xmath0 , and decreases the kinetic energy by 2.54@xmath0 . on a @xmath97 system ,",
    "the exchange energy is increased by 1.26@xmath0 and the kinetic energy decreases by 2.36@xmath0 . by this measure",
    "a pair of separated holes is lower in energy on three chains by 0.50@xmath0 .",
    "the pair binding energy on the two chain system is 0.28@xmath0 , less than the difference in hole energy between two and three chains .",
    "we now consider a four chain ladder system with a single hole . unlike the three chain case ,",
    "the probability of finding the hole on the center two chains is about the same as finding it on an outer chain .",
    "this is despite the fact that only three bonds are broken when the hole is on an outer chain , versus four for an inner chain . in fig .",
    "5(a , b ) we show the bond strengths about a dynamic hole on an outer chain and on an inner chain .",
    "next - nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic bonds have formed across the hole .",
    "dimerization is also present . the frustration energy of the hole locations shown in fig .",
    "5(a ) and ( b ) are 0.26@xmath0 and 0.42@xmath0 , respectively .",
    "the additonal spins surrounding the hole , compared to two or three chains , tend to reduce both horizontal and vertical dimerization .",
    "the precise pattern of frustrating bonds and dimerization is somewhat complicated .",
    "one could imagine putting in a static vacancy and including next - nearest - neighbor interactions @xmath98 about the vacancy to approximate the effect of hole motion .",
    "this approach neglects the ability of the hole to hop preferentially between some pairs of sites in order to adapt to the frustration .",
    "this effect is visible in fig .",
    "5(b ) , where the hole prefers to hop vertically rather than horizontally , and the vertical frustrating bond is stronger .    in fig .",
    "5(c , d ) we show the same results , but with the undoped spin background subtracted off .",
    "this indicates more clearly the distortion caused by the hole .",
    "notice that all the bonds immediately surrounding the hole are weaker . in fig .",
    "5(e , f ) we show the same results for static holes ( vacancies ) .",
    "the distortion of the spin background for static holes is much smaller , and for the bonds immediately surrounding the hole , opposite in sign .",
    "the static hole induces no dimerization or frustration .",
    "we now consider two holes on a four chain ladder . in fig .",
    "6 we show the expectation value of the kinetic energy on each bond , when the location of only one of the holes has been specified with the projection operator @xmath25 .",
    "it is clear that the two holes are bound .",
    "however , the precise pattern of hopping initially seems rather strange .",
    "the patterns primarily reflect the fact that an _ undoped _ two - leg ladder configuration of spins is a low energy configuration .",
    "one can compare undoped ladders with even numbers of legs , which have a spin gap , and odd numbers of legs , which are gapless .",
    "it is natural to expect that the gap comes about both by a rise in the spin excitation energy _ and _ a lowering in the `` vacuum '' ground - state energy .",
    "thus we expect a two chain undoped ladder , which has a very large gap of about @xmath99 , to be an especially low energy system in some sense . hence the two holes in fig .",
    "6 prefer to lie on either the top two legs or the bottom two legs , or the top and the bottom legs , but not on the first and third , second and third , or second and fourth .",
    "if a hole is on the `` wrong leg '' , it especially does nt like to hop horizontally .",
    "a four chain undoped system will also have low energy , since it too has a spin gap .",
    "tsunetsugu , et .",
    "al.@xcite have argued that this can lead to striped phases in which one dimensional lines of holes divide ladders with even numbers of legs .",
    "our results clearly indicate that both single holes and pairs of holes often arrange their motion so that undoped two - leg ladder - like arrangements of spins can form .",
    "the tendency toward formation of four - leg ladder structures is weaker .",
    "the three chain results can also be interpreted in terms of ladder formation , in that the holes predominantly sit on the outer legs , with the other two legs near each hole forming an undoped two chain system .",
    "an important difference between the structures we see and those suggested by tsunetsugu , et .",
    "is in the density of holes or pairs of holes adjacent to the ladders : we see quite low densities , while they suggested a line of holes with density near unity .    in fig .",
    "7 we show the bond strengths about the two most probable hole configurations , which are almost equally probable . in ( a )",
    "we see the strong next - nearest neighbor diagonal singlet bond crossing the holes .",
    "horizontal hopping transforms this diagonal bond into vertical bonds which sit on each side of the pair , as seen in ( b ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of a pair of holes is -5.16@xmath0 , compared with -5.25@xmath0 for two separate holes .",
    "the increase in exchange energy caused by a pair of holes is 2.47@xmath0 , compared with 2.78@xmath0 for two separate holes . as in the two - chain case ,",
    "the slight increase in kinetic energy from binding a pair of holes is more than made up for by the decrease in exchange energy .",
    "the pair binding energy is @xmath100 .",
    "this pair binding energy is smaller by 25% than the two chain value .",
    "in contrast , the spin gap for the undoped four chain system is smaller by over 60% compared to two chains . the frustration energy corresponding to fig .",
    "7(a ) is 0.20@xmath0 . for fig .",
    "7(b ) , it is 0.14@xmath0 .",
    "the frustration energy of two separate holes would be 0.51@xmath0 if they were both on outer legs , and 0.68@xmath0 if one was on an outer leg and one on an inner leg .",
    "we now consider a five chain ladder system with a single hole . recall that a single hole on a three chain ladder spent most of the time on an outer chain .",
    "since the undoped three and five chain systems have similar , gapless ground states , one might expect a hole on the five chain system to spend more time on an outer chain than in the center .",
    "however , this is not the case . in fig .",

    "the hole spends most of the time on the center chain . by moving on the center chain ,",
    "the system is divided into two undoped two - chain ladder systems above and below the hole . as fig .",
    "8(b ) shows , this configuration allows the vertical dimerization found in the three chain system to form both above and below the hole , allowing a strong frustrating bond to form horizontally across the hole .",
    "the hole tends not to hop all the way to the ends of the system so that vertical two - chain structures can form there .",
    "the frustration energy at site ( 4,3 ) is @xmath102 . in fig .",
    "8(c ) , the corresponding spin configuration is shown . the same shifted nel pattern found in three chains is again seen , with the spins on an entire five - site rung shifting with the motion of the hole .",
    "two holes in this system repel .",
    "the spin configuration around a single hole is highly favorable , as in the three chain case .",
    "the `` core '' of a bound pair of holes is a @xmath4 plaquette .",
    "if a pair were to form , it would divide the system into a two chain ladder and a single chain , and the single chain would have high energy .",
    "in fact , the separate holes form the structure shown in fig .",
    "9(a ) , where the system is divided into ladders both horizontally and vertically ! in fig .",
    "9(b ) , we show the kinetic energy of one of the holes when the other is projected onto a site .",
    "the holes clearly are unbound .",
    "the system dimerizes vertically above and below each hole , and horizontally to the left and right of each hole .",
    "the vertical hopping patterns are highly dependent on the length of the system .",
    "an @xmath101 system with two holes allows convenient division of the system into width - two pieces in both directions . in fig .",

    "9(d ) , we see that when the first hole is on site ( 3,3 ) , the motion of the second holes divides the right part of the system into either two horizontal two - chain ladders or into a vertical two - chain and a vertical four - chain ladder .",
    "we now consider an @xmath104 cluster with a single hole . in fig .",
    "10(a ) we show the kinetic energy per bond for the hole .",
    "a single hole is likely to be found in the central sites of the cluster , allowing a two leg ladder to run along the entire edge of the system .",
    "some slight asymmetry is visible in the figure ; this is a result of a slight numerical inaccuracy in the dmrg calculation .",
    "we kept 600 states per block in this calculation ; despite this many states , the truncation error ( also refered to as the discarded weight ) was relatively high : about @xmath105 .",

    "10(b ) we show the bond strengths about the hole projected onto a central site .",
    "next - nearest - neighbor antiferromagnetic bonds have formed across the hole , but they are somewhat weaker than in the narrower systems .",

    "the distortion caused by the hole is fairly substantial over a @xmath106 region .",
    "all the bonds immediately surrounding the hole are weaker . in fig .",
    "10(d ) we show the same results for a static hole .",
    "the distortion of the spin background is much smaller than for a dynamic hole ( note the decreased scale ) , and for the bonds immediately surrounding the hole , opposite in sign .",
    "the frustration energy for this hole location is @xmath107 .    in fig .",
    "11 we show results for two holes on an @xmath104 cluster .",
    "again we kept 600 states per block , but the truncation error was higher than in the single - hole calculation : @xmath108 .",
    "this was still sufficient to determine the structure of the pair with reasonable accuracy and to determine the pair binding energy . in fig .",
    "11(a ) we show the expectation value of the kinetic energy of a hole , when the other hole has been projected onto a central site .",
    "the two holes are clearly bound .",
    "the hole is somewhat more likely to be to the left of the projected hole than one might expect ; however , this configuration breaks the system vertically into two - chain and four - chain undoped ladders , rather than two three - chain undoped ladders .    in fig .",
    "11(b - d ) we show the bond strengths surrounding several likely configurations of the pair .",
    "the frustrating diagonal singlet crossing the pair is clearly present in fig .",

    "the increase in exchange energy caused by a pair of holes is 2.71@xmath0 , compared with 2.96@xmath0 for two separate holes .",
    "the increase in kinetic energy from binding a pair of holes is very tiny , and is more than made up for by the decrease in exchange energy .",
    "the pair binding energy is @xmath111 .",
    "this pair binding energy is slightly bigger than on a @xmath112 lattice .",
    "we have performed a few dmrg studies of width 7 systems .",
    "we studied a @xmath2 cluster with two holes , keeping 800 states per block , with a total of 10 sweeps through the lattice .",
    "the truncation error was fairly large , @xmath108 , but it was clear that the two holes were bound , and tended to stay near the center of the cluster . in general , the results were similar to the @xmath104 cluster .",
    "we also studied a @xmath113 cluster with a staggered magnetic field @xmath114 applied to the edge sites .",
    "the idea was to simulate the nel spin background of an infinite undoped lattice .",
    "the field strength was chosen to represent a mean field coupling to surrounding sites , each with an average magnetization of @xmath115 .",
    "again , two holes were bound , with a pair binding energy of about @xmath116 .      the bound pair of holes which have been found in a number of these clusters are characterized by a @xmath4 core region over which the dominant hole - hole correlations occur . in order to better understand this core we consider the @xmath4 lattice shown in fig .",
    "12 .    introducing",

    "this is reflected in the @xmath0-@xmath1 results previously discussed , where for @xmath3 the hole - hole correlations were found to be larger for next - nearest - neighbor diagonal sites than for nearest - neighbor sites .    the ground state , eq .",
    "( [ undoped ] ) , of the undoped @xmath4 system transforms as @xmath127 , while the two - hole state , eq .",
    "( [ doped ] ) , transforms as an @xmath11-wave .",
    "thus the hole - pair creation operator that connects @xmath128 to @xmath123 must tranform as @xmath127@xcite .",
    "a simple nearest - neighbor operator of this form is @xmath129 applying this to the undoped ground state @xmath128 given by eq .",
    "( [ undoped ] ) , one finds that @xmath130|0\\rangle   .\\ ] ] this clearly has a nonzero overlap with with the two - hole ground state @xmath123 , but it does not contain the diagonal singlet parts .",
    "however , if we were to `` time - evolve '' this state towards the two - hole ground state by applying @xmath131 we would have for short imaginary times @xmath132 @xmath133 and the hopping kinetic energy in @xmath134 generates the diagonal singlet terms @xmath135 an improved hole pair creation operator would include , in addition to @xmath136 , terms of the form @xmath137 .",
    "a @xmath127 hole pair creation operator , generalized to include holes on next - nearest - neighbor diagonal sites , has been discussed by poilblanc@xcite .",
    "one can expand a generalized hole - pair creation operator in terms of operators which create a pair of holes on sites separated by a distance @xmath138 .",
    "for our @xmath4 cluster this involves @xmath139 with @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "the nearest - neighbor operator @xmath142 is just the operator given in eq .",
    "( [ nnd ] ) . as discussed by poilblanc , a next - nearest - neighbor term possessing @xmath127 symmetry is @xmath143 with @xmath144 note that since @xmath145 , eq . ( [ pd ] ) has @xmath127 symmetry .",
    "acting on the undoped ground state , @xmath146 generates the diagonal singlets @xmath147 the action of this operator on @xmath128 is the same as @xmath137 .    based on this , we believe that the bound hole pairs observed in various clusters should be thought of as @xmath127 pairs .",
    "the diagonal - singlet bond as well as the nearest - neighbor singlet bonds reflect the two - hole structure of eq .",
    "( [ doped ] ) . in the larger clusters",
    "the pair structure is more extended , corresponding to further operations of @xmath148 on @xmath149 in eq .",
    "( [ sumr ] ) .",
    "the pair structure on larger systems includes both larger separation of the holes and alterations of the spin background near the pair .",
    "in considering one and two hole ground states of a wide variety of clusters , we have found a remarkable sensitivity to the shape of the cluster . underlying the variety of results , however , are a few basic low - energy structures",
    ". the nature of the ground state of any particular system is based on which arrangement of these basic structures is lowest in energy .",
    "the most important structure is a bound pair of holes .",
    "this structure allows the pair to hop rather freely in order to decrease the kinetic energy , without disrupting the spin background more than necessary .",
    "the bound pair is characterized by a @xmath4 `` core '' region discussed above . surrounding the core and extending several lattice spacings",
    "further is a region in which the spin structure is strongly perturbed . within the core , for the case @xmath3",
    "which we have studied , the pair of holes is more likely to be at next - nearest - neighbor diagonal sites than nearest - neighbor sites , in order to maximize the hopping overlap with other hole configurations .",
    "when the two holes are diagonally situated , a strong singlet bond is present across the other two sites of the core .",
    "this singlet becomes a strong nearest - neighbor singlet bond after one of the holes hops next to the other .",
    "the singlet forms in order to maximize the hopping overlap with these other hole configurations . in order to respond to this frustrating bond , and to other weaker frustrating bonds across each of the holes , the surrounding spins dimerize , reducing the spin - spin correlations around the pair .",
    "the effect of this dimerization is to induce a `` spin - liquid '' region surrounding the pair .    frustrating next - nearest - neighbor bonds forming across holes",
    "are a universal feature in all of the clusters we have studied .",
    "these bonds are necessary for hole motion .",
    "holes bind in pairs in order to share their frustration .",
    "this mechanism for pairing is quite different from simple `` broken - bond '' counting , which predicts nearest - neighbor pairing for _ static _ holes : for two static holes , a nearest neighbor configuration eliminates seven bonds , while anything else eliminates eight . for physical values of @xmath59 , such as @xmath3 ,",
    "the `` broken - bond '' effect enhances pair - binding somewhat , but is not dominant .",
    "consider once again the @xmath104 cluster , with two holes .",
    "results for the hole - hole correlation function indicate that the pair resides on nearest - neighbor sites only 22% of the time . even if a broken bond results in an extra exchange energy of @xmath17 , the effect on pair binding is only @xmath150 , while the actual pair binding energy is @xmath151 .",
    "a more accurate estimate of the effect of broken bonds comes from considering two _ static _ holes on an @xmath104 cluster : the difference in energy between nearest - neighbor static holes and widely separated holes is @xmath152 , rather than @xmath1 , suggesting that the broken - bond energy for dynamic holes is about @xmath153 .",
    "in contrast , the frustration energy for two bound holes in the most probable hole configurations ranges from 0.25@xmath0 - 0.40@xmath0 _ less than _ the frustration energy of two separate dynamic holes .",
    "the next most important structure is a nearly undoped two - leg ladder region .",
    "the large spin gap of a two - leg ladder coincides with a low energy spin - liquid ground state .",
    "the two - leg ladder is dimerized , in that the rung bonds are stronger than the leg bonds .",
    "this makes the ladder especially suited for a hole or pair of holes to move beside it .    usually when ladder structures form , they are bounded by regions with pairs .",
    "in the special case of a five - leg ladder , pairs of holes are too wide , and the system instead has unpaired holes moving in one dimension , breaking the system into two - leg ladders .",
    "this is the last important structure : a one - dimensional line of unpaired holes .",
    "this structure is low enough in energy that it can appear in order to allow the formation of one or two undoped two - leg ladders , specifically in the three and five chain systems .",
    "the energy difference between these structures is sufficiently small that modest external perturbations can lead to the trapping of holes or the formation of static even - leg ladders . even in the absence of external perturbations",
    ", we would expect that a dilute concentration of holes will give rise to fluctuating extended structures in the medium .",
    "although we have not presented results here for more than two holes , we have such results for three , four , and five chains and will present them elsewhere . based on our results at finite doping , we believe that the tendency to form two - leg ladders persists into the finite , but low doping regime , while at moderate doping",
    ", ladders diminish in importance and pairs of holes dominate .",
    "the even - leg ladders that are present in the dilute system could give rise to the pseudo - gap observed in the underdoped cuprates .",
    "it has been suggested that holes doped into the @xmath0-@xmath1 model will phase separate@xcite .",
    "however , in our studies with more holes , we find no evidence for phase separation at @xmath3 , which is consistent with previous @xmath0-@xmath1 studies on clusters up to @xmath81 , in which phase separation was found only at larger @xmath59 values@xcite .",
    "the ladder structures we find are not the result of a competition between phase separation and a long - range coulomb interation@xcite , but arise directly from the short - range interactions in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model .",
    "we acknowledge support from the from the nsf under grant nos . dmr-9509945 and dmr9527304 .",
