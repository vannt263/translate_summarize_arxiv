    "the connection between microscopic dynamics of components in stochastic systems and macroscopic description of their behaviour as a whole is very attractive in statistical physics@xcite . from the point of view of a single trajectory ,",

    "such a path is not described by an analytical function . in the theory of brownian motion formulated by langevin@xcite",
    "the velocity of the brownian particle was proved to be discontinuous@xcite .",
    "the differentiable nature of the macroscopic picture of brownian motion is due to the key role of the central limit theorem ( fluctuations of the microscopic quantities are independent of each other ) .",
    "this means that the microscopic and macroscopic levels of description of the process are separated in the time scale , and memory of the non - differentiable character peculiar to the microscopic dynamics is lost in the long time limit .",
    "consequently , the results of observing the motion of an ensemble of trajectories can be predicted by means of theoretical prescriptions based on ordinary mathematical procedures proceeding from the differentiability assumption .",
    "when the condition of time - scale separation is not available , the non - differentiable nature of the microscopic dynamics can be transmitted to the macroscopic level@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we show that the key to this understanding is memory effects in stochastic systems .",
    "it is due to memory effects that the macroscopic behaviour of stochatic systems contains a manifestation of microscopic dynamics .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section  [ par2 ] is devoted to the behaviour of relaxation in the physical systems without and with complete memory . in section  [ par3 ]",
    "we use the generalized ( in the terms of the memory effects ) langevin and kramers - moyal equations to shown that , by means of the memory function , the non - differentiable nature of microscopic dynamics of system components can be transmitted to the macroscopic level of description in the form of fractional derivatives . note that the memory effects can induce orderedness of macroscopic processes in stochatic systems . in section  [ par4 ]",
    "we briefly consider the criterion of the relative degree of order in the systems .",
    "section  [ par5 ] is devoted to the time fractional diffusion - wave equation concerning the case when chaos and order coexist .",
    "finally we compare the process described by the latter equation with the fractional brownian motion .",
    "we start from some classification of memory effects . it is based on mathematical properties of the corresponding memory function .",
    "let us consider the integro - differential equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the quantity of interest , @xmath2 the memory kernel , and @xmath3 the parameter .",
    "the equation is a typical non - markovian equation obtained in studying the physical systems coupled to an environment , with environmental degrees of freedom being averaged .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 can be regarded as the strength of the perturbation induced by the environment of the system .    for a system without memory ( ideal markov system ) ,",
    "the time dependence of the memory function @xmath4 is of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dirac @xmath7-function .",
    "the absence of memory means that the convolution function , @xmath8 , is defined by @xmath9 at the only instant @xmath10 . substituting ( [ eq2 ] ) into ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "we obtain @xmath11 equation ( [ eq3 ] ) has an exponential solution . if memory effects are introduced into the system the @xmath7-function in ( [ eq2 ] ) turns into a bell - shaped function , with the width determining an interval @xmath12 during which @xmath9 has an effect on the function @xmath13 .    in the literature ,",
    "wide use is made of the markov approximation , which replaces the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) with the rate equation @xmath14 the van hove limit@xcite implies that the limit @xmath15 , @xmath16 is approached to in such a way that the product @xmath17 is kept constant . using the van hove limit makes it possible to replace the time convolution in ( [ eq1 ] ) with @xmath18 where @xmath19 the limit @xmath15 implies that the coupling of the system to the environment is weak , while the limit @xmath16 means that the observation time is much larger than the characteristic time scale @xmath12 .",
    "on the other hand , in the systems having ideal complete memory the function @xmath13 is formed over all the course of the action of the quantity @xmath20 up to the instant @xmath10 with the weight @xmath21 ( step function ) . in this case the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is transformed into @xmath22 it has the unique solution , @xmath23 , which does not decrease at @xmath16 in contrast to ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "relation ( [ eq1 ] ) written in the time domain is not always convenient because of the convolution ( integral over @xmath24 ) .",
    "this can be eliminated by using the laplace transformation @xmath25=\\int_{0}^{\\infty}f(t)\\,e^{-st}\\,dt,\\qquad",
    "f(t)=\\frac{1}{2\\pi i}\\int^{+i\\infty}_{-i\\infty}\\bar f(s)\\,e^{st}\\,ds.\\ ] ] in this case the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) reduces to the algebraic form @xmath26 where the initial condition is taken into account .",
    "the laplace transform of the kernel ( [ eq2 ] ) , which corresponds to the absence of memory , yields the constant , @xmath27 . for ideal memory , we obtain @xmath28 .",
    "thus , as the ideal complete memory appears in the system the constant kernel is replaced by the hyperbolic one .",
    "it is logical to infer that the fractional integration of the order @xmath29 , @xmath30 , will interpolate the memory function between the @xmath7-function and step function .",
    "systems with such a memory function occupy an intermediate position between the two limiting cases and are described in @xcite .",
    "they have complete but not ideal memory .",
    "this means that the memory manifests itself within all the interval @xmath31 but not at each instant @xmath24 .",
    "such a memory function has no characteristic time scale , i.  e.  the markov approximation is inapplicable .",
    "assume that memory holds only at the points of a cantor set .",
    "the problem lies in finding the laplace transform of a step memory function . to construct a cantor set",
    ", we first choose the entire time interval of the length @xmath32 and remove the central part of the interval leaving two intervals of the length @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 ) . obviously , to avoid the loss of the integral memory ,",
    "the heights of the two resulting bars must be increased to the value @xmath35 . in the next stage , each remaining interval of the length @xmath33 is subjected to the same division process . in each subsequent stage",
    "@xmath36 , this contraction procedure is performed for the @xmath37 stages obtained in the preceding stage .",
    "one can easily see that the memory function @xmath38 is represented by a set of @xmath39 bars of the height @xmath40 and of the width @xmath41 .",
    "the laplace image of @xmath38 is written as @xmath42 for @xmath43 we have @xmath44 .",
    "as the special investigations show @xcite(chapter  5 ) , the limiting value of the function @xmath45 , when the number of divisions generating the cantor set tends to infinity , becomes @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the fractal dimension and @xmath48 is the periodical function with the period @xmath49 . from the physical point of view",
    "the fractal dimension @xmath29 informs us about the ralative amount of states being conserved in the process of interaction and represents a quantitative measure of memory effects .",
    "it is clear from the analysis of the limiting case . for an empty cantor set ( @xmath50 ) the dependence ( [ eq9 ] ) reduces to the constant , corresponding to the entire absence of memory ( in the @xmath10-domain it consists of two delta - functions located on the edges of the cantor set ) .",
    "the limiting value of the similarity parameter @xmath51 yields the dimension @xmath52 , which corresponds to the complete memory .",
    "the result ( [ eq9 ] ) is correct for any @xmath53 from the interval @xmath54 or for the time variable located in the interval @xmath55 averaging the function @xmath48 in ( [ eq9 ] ) over the period @xmath49 ( see details in @xcite ) and taking the inverse laplace transform of @xmath56 , we obtain the temporal fractional integral @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the gamma function ( see appendix ) .",
    "the averaging procedure converts the discrete fractal density @xmath59 to its continuous value , @xmath60 .",
    "now the kernel @xmath4 in ( [ eq1 ] ) becomes @xmath61 indicating the presence of the fractional integral .",
    "the integral representation of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is equivalent to a differential equation of the fractional order .",
    "the above result ( [ eq9 ] ) can be generalized to the case of an arbitrary number @xmath62 of elementary blocks participating in the construction of a cantor set .",
    "it turns out@xcite that the result ( [ eq9 ] ) remains true given that @xmath63 .",
    "the transition from the regular cantor sets to the case , when the parameter @xmath64 is random in each stage of constructing a cantor set , leads to the same result .",
    "thus , the systems with residual memory have @xmath65 , where the exponent value , @xmath66 , determines the extent of memory preservation . substituting it into ( [ eq7 ] ) ( let all constants be contained in @xmath67 ) and using the inverse laplace transformation",
    ", the solution of equation ( [ eq1 ] ) takes the form : @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the one - parameter mittag - leffler function@xcite . in the particular cases @xmath50 and @xmath52 we have @xmath70 for @xmath30 the quantity @xmath9 has an algebraic decay as @xmath16 .",
    "therefore memory effects can essentially change the character of relaxation .",
    "the above constructions are not only pure theoretical , but reflect the experimental situation . in this connection",
    "it should be mentioned that , for example , the relaxation curves of the experiments@xcite on glassy material with the remarkable accuracy show the algebraic decay rather than the standard exponential relaxation .",
    "the power - law relaxation can be expected to be a common feature of dynamical systems in a transition region between the stochastic and regular motion ( supercooled liquids , glasses and polymer materials)@xcite .",
    "it is well known@xcite that the generalized langevin equation is of the form @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the particle s velocity , @xmath73 some memory function , @xmath74 the noise term .",
    "if the value @xmath75 is observed with a time resolution @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the correlation time of forces producing the random particle motion , the markov approximation is applicable , so that we obtain the ordinary langevin equation @xmath78 in the case of complete but not ideal memory the generalized langevin equation becomes a fractional differential equation .",
    "the evolution of the probability distribution associated with the velocity in the fractional langevin equation is described by the fractional partial differential equation in the phase space for the phenomenon@xcite .",
    "consider the probability distribution @xmath79 to find a particle at point @xmath80 and time @xmath10 .",
    "the normalization condition is @xmath81 a broad class of various stochastic processes is given by the chapman - kolmogorov equation : @xmath82 where the memory function @xmath83 accounts for the probability distribution @xmath84 in the previous instantes of time @xmath85@xcite .",
    "the expansion of the kernel @xmath73 in terms of the difference @xmath86 yields the generalized ( in the terms of the memory effects ) kramers - moyal equation @xmath87 where @xmath88 and the coefficients @xmath89 are the moments of the memory function @xmath73 divided by @xmath90 . in the case of markovian processes",
    "the moments are proportional to @xmath6 and the integration in ( [ eq12 ] ) vanishes .",
    "it is relevant to remark that @xmath10 in ( [ eq12 ] ) should be treated in the `` kinetic '' but not `` microscopic '' sense .",
    "the markov approximation ( the van hove method@xcite ) ignores memory effects in some sense , but such approach is not always useful . for example , the statistical theory describing transport properties of turbulent plasma leads to the conclusion that the turbulence is of subdiffusive nature and that the diffusivity considerably decreases .",
    "therefore , memory effects can be important for explaining the dependence of the transport properties of saturated turbulence on the eigenfrequency of the unstable mode in the case of instability driven by the gradients in the coordinate space@xcite .    using ( [ eq12 ] ) one can write the equation : @xmath91 where @xmath92 are arbitrary functions . the application of the laplace transform to ( [ eq13 ] ) ( with the initial values given on the whole real axis in the form @xmath93 ) leads to the following nonhomogeneous differential equation @xmath94 consider the case when memory is complete but not ideal ( see previous paragraph ) .",
    "then we come to the following equation @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the positive constant . using the caputo s definition ( [ a11 ] ) of the fractional derivative ( see @xcite and appendix ) and its laplace transform ( [ a14 ] )",
