    "we also employed two polarization @xmath96 functions @xcite . for farther ligands in our clusters we applied minimal atomic - natural - orbital basis sets @xcite .",

    "to separate the o @xmath21 valence orbitals into two different groups , i.e. , at sites of the central octahedron and at nn octahedra , we used the orbital localization module available in molpro .",
