    "<S> there has been considerable interest in the flavor dependence of the proton s quark distributions . </S>",
    "<S> about ten years ago , the nmc measurement of the integral of the @xmath9 provided convincing evidence for the flavor asymmetry of the sea @xcite . the meson cloud model and the sullivan process were used to explain the momentum fraction distribution of @xmath9 . for reviews , </S>",
    "<S> see refs .  . </S>",
    "<S> interest in the light sea quark distributions was heightened by the recent measurement of the ratio @xmath10 by means of the drell - yan process @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar results for @xmath9 were obtained by hermes @xcite . in the context of previous work on the light antiquark asymmetry in the nucleon , a good description of the data was obtained for the @xmath11-dependence ( momentum fraction ) of @xmath9 , but not for the ratio of @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the meson cloud models provide ratios that either increase monotonically with @xmath11 or turn back towards unity too slowly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> various explanations have been advanced for the discrepancy , e.g. , effects of the @xmath12 @xcite-@xcite , and the influence of the pauli exclusion principle @xcite , adjustment of parameters @xcite , but none of these changes provides a satisfactory description of the @xmath10 distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> the use of a soft @xmath13n@xmath12 form factor enables a reasonable description of @xmath14 @xcite , but then @xmath10 is too large . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of understanding the ratio @xmath10 was emphasized recently @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we show that the inclusion of the @xmath15 meson along with pion cloud effects , provides a good description of the present data for both @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the @xmath15 in providing the repulsive short - range part of the nucleon - nucleon and consequently attractive nucleon - antinucleon force has been known for a long time . </S>",
    "<S> the compton wavelength of this meson is small , but the large ( almost puzzlingly large @xmath16 ) coupling constants universally used to describe the nucleon - nucleon scattering data cause the potential to be non - vanishing over a fairly large range . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath15 meson also may be very important in deep inelastic scattering from nuclei @xcite , so it is natural to consider its effects for a proton target .    </S>",
    "<S> we provide the usual formulae for the effects of the meson cloud ( generalized sullivan process ) in order to facilitate the reader s understanding of what follows . </S>",
    "<S> the wave function of the proton is written in terms of fock states with and without mesons @xmath17 here z is a wavefunction renormalization constant , @xmath18 is the probability amplitude for finding a physical nucleon in a state consisting of a baryon , @xmath19 with longitudinal momentum fraction y and meson @xmath20 of momentum fraction ( 1-y ) and squared transverse relative momentum @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> the quark distribution function @xmath22 of a proton is given by @xmath23 with @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 the cut - offs required in the model are taken from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a cut - off parameter for each meson and @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the usual kinematical variables , expressed in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath32 . such a form is required to respect the identity ( [ sym ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the expressions for the splitting functions @xmath33 are those given by as derived in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we include specifically @xmath13 , @xmath15 , and @xmath34 mesons , but the latter is negligible . in the present paper , we omit the effects of the @xmath35 meson as well as those of the intermediate @xmath12 . the former increases @xmath9 , whereas the latter decreases it , so these effects tend to cancel . </S>",
    "<S> these effects have been included by previous authors , and do not provide a satisfactory description of the ratio @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> the number of each type of meson , @xmath37 , is obtained by integrating the square of @xmath33 over @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> then for us @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> we need to discuss the functions @xmath39 and @xmath40 of our calculation . </S>",
    "<S> those for the nucleon and pion are measured , but the quark distribution functions of the @xmath15 meson are unknown . </S>",
    "<S> the bag model suggests that the structure functions of the @xmath15 , @xmath41 and @xmath13 mesons are the same . </S>",
    "<S> the near equality is more believable for the @xmath15 and @xmath35 , than for that between the vector and pseudoscalar mesons . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been traditional @xcite to assume that the structure function of the @xmath35 and @xmath13 are the same . </S>",
    "<S> thus we use @xcite @xmath42 for the valence and sea quark distributions of both the pion and omega mesons . </S>",
    "<S> the bare nucleon sea is parametrized @xcite as @xmath43    the value of @xmath44 gev is chosen to reproduce the range of allowed values of the integral @xcite @xmath45 using the sum rule of henley & miller @xcite : @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath47 is expected to be larger than @xmath48 @xcite , and we used the range : 1.3 gev @xmath49 1.8 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> the results of our calculations for @xmath50 are shown in fig .  1 , and those for the ratio @xmath51 are shown in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath13-nucleon coupling constant is taken as @xmath52 , the @xmath15-proton coupling constant is taken to be @xmath53 = 8.1 . in fig .  1 </S>",
    "<S> the solid line is for @xmath54 gev , for which @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines are for @xmath56 gev and @xmath57 gev , the range of values constrained by the experimental error of @xmath58 in @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath60 meson , like any other isoscalar meson , has no effect here , so that this curve is that from the pion alone . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 2 the solid curve shown is for @xmath61 gev . the dashed line shows the effect of leaving out the @xmath15 cloud contribution .    </S>",
    "<S> we have examined the effect of varying both @xmath47 and @xmath62 in the range @xmath63 gev @xmath64 gev and @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the larger values of @xmath62 are favored in fits to nucleon - nucleon scattering data using one - boson exchange potentials @xcite and the smaller ones from dispersion relation descriptions of forward nucleon - nucleon scattering . </S>",
    "<S> the larger values of @xmath62 and @xmath66 tend to give too small values of the ratio @xmath67 , while decreasing @xmath62 or @xmath66 causes the maximum value of @xmath10 to be too large and to appear at too high a value of @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> the effects of @xmath34 mesons are not included in the curves shown in the figures . </S>",
    "<S> these provide only a 1 to 2% change in @xmath68 for phenomenologically viable coupling constants . </S>",
    "<S> although we also examined the change of distribution function for the bare quarks suggested by @xcite , the effect is sufficiently small when added to that of the @xmath15 meson that we do not show it .    </S>",
    "<S> it is clear from the figures that a good description of the present data is provided by the inclusion of the @xmath15 meson with a reasonable coupling constant , and that therefore the meson cloud picture can be successful . as mentioned above </S>",
    "<S> there are a number of effects discussed in the literature , not included here , which contribute to the proton sea . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , one could include the effects of the @xmath69 meson , which would also tend to suppress @xmath68 . including these effects is likely to improve the description of the data or modify the parameters describing the @xmath15-nucleon interaction .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of better data would provide a severe test of the present model , and the prospects of such seem imminent @xcite . but it is fair to conclude that the use of the @xmath15 along with the previously suggested meson cloud effects does allow for a good description of the present data .    </S>",
