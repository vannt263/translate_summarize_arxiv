    "nanometer - scale devices based on different kinds of ( metallic , semiconducting , magnetic , etc . ) nanowires ( nws ) have widely been demonstrated in various potential applications , such as nanoelectronics , nano - electromechanical systems , optoelectronics , and spintronics.@xcite to characterize intrinsic nw properties as well as to interrogate the performance of a nanodevice , how to successfully attach submicron electrical contacts to individual nws is a crucial step . until recently ,",
    "the charge conduction properties of electronic nanocontacts and their possible effects on device operations have often been overlooked , in particular in the case of metallic nws.@xcite obviously , poor knowledge about such properties could lead to a less quantitative description or even a misinterpretation of the experimental data.@xcite besides , ignorance of possible degradative effects due to the nanocontacts might cause damages to nanoelectronic circuitries . in this regard ,",
    "a good understanding of the electronic conduction processes through a nanocontact is of both scientific and technological importance .    in a recent paper ( ref .  )",
    ", we have demonstrated that the temperature behavior of electronic contact resistances , @xmath3 , formed at the interfaces between various metallic ( ruo@xmath2 , iro@xmath2 , and sn - doped in@xmath2o@xmath4 ) nws and lithography - patterned submicron cr / au electrodes can be well described by the fluctuation - induced tunneling ( fit ) conduction model proposed by sheng and co - workers.@xcite in ref .",
    ", the nws were first disposed onto a sio@xmath2-capped si wafer and the delicate electron - beam lithography and lift - off technique was applied to make the contacting electrodes in a two - probe configuration . under proper conditions , one can intentionally make the nanocontact resistance @xmath5 much larger than both the metallic nw resistance and the contacting electrode resistance .",
    "therefore , the measured device resistance @xmath6@xmath7@xmath8 , where we have assumed that @xmath5 is the same for the two nanocontacts in a two - probe configuration because the two nanocontacts had been fabricated simultaneously and under the same conditions .",
    "the @xmath3 curves between 1.5 and 300 k had been measured in the limit of zero bias voltage , where the current - voltage ( @xmath0-@xmath1 ) characteristics were linear , i.e. ohmic .",
    "we explicitly demonstrated that @xmath5 increased with decreasing temperature , but with a rate much slower than that would be due to the thermal - activation - type conduction ( @xmath9exp(@xmath10 ) , where @xmath11 is a characteristic temperature ) , especially at liquid - helium temperatures .    in this work",
    ", we aim to further test the validity of the fit conduction model by employing an alternative nanodevice contact configuration . here",
    "we fabricate individual nw devices with the nws being directly placed on the surfaces of two pre - patterned cr / au electrodes which were made by the simple photolithography .",
    "in particular , the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves in both the low - bias voltage regime and the high - bias voltage ( i.e. non - ohmic ) regime have been measured .",
    "we found that our overall experimental results can still be well described by the fit conduction theory , indicating the general importance of the thermal fluctuation effect in electronic nanocontacts.@xcite our observations are reported below .",
    "the ruo@xmath12 nws used in this study were synthesized by the thermal evaporation method , as described in ref .  .",
    "the as - synthesized nws were dispersed by ultrasonic agitation into ethanol solution .",
    "several droplets of the solution were dropped onto a si substrate capped with a @xmath13500 nm sio@xmath2 layer . on the sio@xmath2 layer , an array of micron - sized electrode pairs consisting of two cr / au ( @xmath1320/100 nm ) fingers separated by @xmath145 @xmath15 m were pre - patterned by the standard photolithography and lift - off technique .",
    "the substrates were inspected by a scanning electron microscope ( sem ) , and those electrode pairs which were bridged with only one ruo@xmath2 nw were selected for @xmath0-@xmath1 curve measurements .",
    "electrical leads from the cr / au electrode pairs to macro cu wires were connected with ag paste .",
    "a keithley model k-220 current source and a model k-617 electrometer were used . for measurements from 300 k down to 1.5 k",

    "high - resistance contacts are easily obtained.@xcite for semiconducting nws,@xcite the tunnel barrier is an insulating layer inherently formed on the surface of the as - synthesized nw . however , for the metallic ruo@xmath2 nws,@xcite the tunnel barrier separating the metallic nw and the contacting electrode is externally introduced,@xcite and its exact origin needs further investigations .",

    "it is seen that the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves are symmetric about zero bias voltage at all measurement temperatures . at low bias voltages ,",

    "as expected , the nonlinearity becomes progressively pronounced at lower temperatures .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) indicates that the ohmic regime persists up to about 4 mv at 1.6 k. it should be noted that , even at our highest bias voltages and at the lowest measurement temperatures , the power dissipation in the nw device is still small ( @xmath172@xmath18@xmath19 w ) , and thus the electron overheating effect can be safely ignored .",

    "similar to our previous finding in ref .",
    ", one sees that the @xmath20 increases with decreasing temperature and eventually saturates at a few degrees of kelvin.@xcite as has been demonstrated in ref .  , the sum of the individual ruo@xmath2 nw resistance and the two cr / au electrode resistances is @xmath171.5 k@xmath21 , which is @xmath143 orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath20 .",

    "]    the fit model addresses the electronic conduction properties of a _ mesoscopic _",
    "tunnel junction.@xcite more precisely , the fit theory considers how the electron tunneling process is affected by temperature when the size of a tunnel junction formed between two _ large _ metallic regions becomes sufficiently _",
    "small_. the tunnel junction can be conceptually modeled as a potential barrier with a barrier height @xmath25 , a barrier width @xmath26 , and a lateral area @xmath27 which is the geometrical area at the closest contact between the two large metallic regions .",
    "in addition to the externally applied bias voltage , @xmath28 , the fit theory takes into account the effect of the thermal voltage noise , @xmath29 , on the tunneling current across the junction .",
    "sheng and coworkers realized that the @xmath29@xmath13@xmath30 could be large due to a small @xmath27 , where @xmath31 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath32@xmath9@xmath27 is the capacitance of the junction .",

    "the charge transport through the junction is profoundly affected.@xcite historically , the fit theory has been formulated to explain the temperature dependence of resistance in a wide variety of metal - insulator composites and polymers , where a huge number of tunnel junctions is involved and an effective junction representing the whole network had to be assumed in the model.@xcite    according to the fit theory,@xcite at small applied electric fields where the @xmath0-@xmath1 characteristic is linear , the temperature dependent zero - bias resistance across a single small junction is given by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a parameter which depends only weakly on temperature , and @xmath35 and @xmath36 are characteristic temperatures defined as @xmath37 and @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the permittivity of vacuum , @xmath40 is the planck s constant , and @xmath41 is the electronic mass . in eq .",

    "apparently , by measuring the @xmath0-@xmath1 curves at various temperatures , one has two different routes to extract the values of @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
