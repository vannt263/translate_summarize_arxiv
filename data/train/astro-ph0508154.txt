    "since their discovery in hi observations @xcite , high velocity clouds ( hvcs ) have been the target of numerous studies ( see @xcite for a thorough review ) but nevertheless remain puzzling .",
    "it is now widely considered that many of them might be infalling clouds fueling the galaxy with low metallicity gas .",
    "this hypothesis received strong support from ultraviolet observations showing that hvcs have a subsolar metallicity @xcite and a d / h ratio compatible with primordial abundances of deuterium @xcite .",
    "the present study focuses on the spitzer extra - galactic first look survey ( xfls ) field , a diffuse hi area ( @xmath3 @xmath4 ) at high galactic latitude ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) programmed to study galaxy populations and clustering @xcite .",
    "the xfls field is located on the edge of complex c , a high - velocity gas structure spanning more than 1500 square degrees on the sky .",
    "complex c has a subsolar metallicity ( @xmath7 ) @xcite , it contains ionised gas observed in @xmath8 emission @xcite and o vi absorption @xcite and is located at a distance greater than 5 kpc from the sun @xcite .",
    "dust emission has been unsuccesfully looked for in hvcs using iras data @xcite .",
    "upper limits were found to be compatible with their low hi column densities , low metallicity ( and therefore low dust / gas ratio ) and their large distance ( i.e. fainter radiation field ) . in this study",
    "we revisit the dust / gas correlation in hvcs using new infrared and hi data .",
    "in this study we used spitzer space telescope ( sst ) mips 24 and 160  @xmath9 m data of the xfls .",
    "the field was covered by mips in 8 scan maps that were combined and destriped , then regridded to 16@xmath10 pixels and median - smoothed .",
    "we complemented the sst data with improved iras 60 and 100  @xmath9 m maps ( iris - @xcite ) .",
    "the fwhm angular resolution of the iris maps is @xmath11 with a pixel size of 1.5 .",
    "the calibration uncertainties on diffuse emission of the sst and iris maps is 10  % .",
    "bright point sources were removed from all infrared maps ( sst and iris ) before convolution by a gaussian beam to bring all of them to the green bank telescope ( gbt ) 9.2 fwhm resolution .",

    "fig .  [ fig_spectrehi ] presents the average 21 cm spectrum of the field and two typical lines - of - sight .",
    "in addition to complex c , the xfls 21 cm data revealed two intermediate - velocity clouds ( ivc1 and ivc2 ) and a local component typical of high - latitude hi emission with a narrow cold component superimposed on a broad warm component @xcite . in this section",
    "we estimate the column density of each of these hi components .",
    "the hvc is well isolated in velocity space and its integrated emission was computed by adding all the channels where @xmath17 km s@xmath16 . on the other hand the two ivcs and the local component overlap in velocity .",
    "the integrated emission of the two ivc components were computed by adding all the channels between @xmath18 km s@xmath16 for ivc1 and @xmath19 km s@xmath16 for ivc2 from which we subtracted the local component contribution estimated by interpolating a baseline on each spectrum ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_spectrehi ] ) .",
    "the local component s integrated emission was computed by adding all channels between @xmath20 km s@xmath16 from which the two ivc contributions were removed .",
    "there is still contribution from the local components in a few channels at @xmath21  km s@xmath16 but they were not added , as the emission is very diffuse and its structure within the noise .    in the optically - thin case ( i.e. when the 21 cm brightness temperature is much smaller than the hi kinetic temperature ) ,",
    "the 21 cm integrated emission is proportional to the hi column density : @xmath22 . the local component is dominated by a broad ( i.e. warm and optically - thin ) component but a fraction of the emission comes from cold gas ( narrow features ) that needs to be corrected for opacity to properly estimate the column density . to do",
    "so we estimated the fraction of warm and cold gas on each line - of - sight using a gaussian decomposition of each spectrum .",
    "for each gaussian component we estimated its opacity correction , considering that thermal and turbulence broadening equally contribute to the velocity dispersion @xmath23 ( i.e. spin temperature is @xmath24 ) , instead of the usual isothermal assumption ( @xcite used @xmath25  k ) .",
    "this allowed us to compute a larger correction for the narrow than for the broad components .",
    "overall the opacity correction for the local component is lower than 6  % .",
    "it reaches its maximum value in the bright filament ( south - western part of the field , see fig .",
    "[ fig_himaps ] ) where our estimate of the hi kinetic temperature gets as low as 50  k. the opacity correction for the two ivcs and the hvc is less than 1% in accordance with their broad lines ( fwhm@xmath26  km  s@xmath16 ) .",

    "the main goal of this study was to separate and determine the infrared emission of the hi components identified with the 21  cm observations . to do",
    "so we considered that the infrared map @xmath28 at wavelength @xmath29 can be represented by the following model @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the column density of the @xmath32 hi component , @xmath33 is the infrared - hi correlation coefficient of component @xmath34 at wavelength @xmath29 and @xmath35 is a residual term .    to estimate the correlation coefficients @xmath36 we performed a chi - square minimisation on the hi and infrared data based on the model given by eq .",

    "the uncertainties on @xmath36 given in table  [ table_ir ] include calibration and statistical uncertainties , taking into account the data sampling . to estimate the impact of our opacity correction we made the same analysis with optically - thin hi maps and obtained the same results within the uncertainties .",
    "the infrared - hi correlation presented here shows that the model used ( eq .",
    "[ eq_regress ] ) for the infrared emission is satisfying . at each wavelength",
    "the standard deviation of the residual term @xmath35 is in good concordance with the expected @xcite and measured @xcite levels of the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) fluctuations ( see table  [ table_ir ] ) , except at 160  @xmath9 m where we report a significant residual excess .",
    "as the residues at 60 and 100  @xmath9 m are in accordance with the cib level , this analysis also leads us to conclude that dust associated with the warm ionised medium ( wim ) @xcite does not significantly bias our decomposition of the infrared emission in this field .",
    "the striking result of this analysis is certainly the significant detection of the infrared emission associated with an hvc at all wavelengths .",
    "our result at 100  @xmath9 m is compatible with the upper limit given by @xcite .",
    "using the infrared - hi correlation coefficients we now want to put contrains on the properties of the dust , especially in the hvc .",
    "we assume that the emission from big grains at thermal equilibrium with the radiation field is a modified black body : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the planck function , @xmath39 is the big grains equilibrium temperature and @xmath40 the opacity , often expressed as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the dust emissivity per h atom .",
    "the emissivity is generally described as a power law : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the emissivity spectral index .",
    "based on firas data , @xcite give the following expression for the big grains emissivity law in the local interstellar medium : @xmath45    in this scheme , and at wavelengths where the emission is dominated by big grains , the infrared - hi correlation coefficients can be expressed as @xmath46 . assuming that very small grains ( vsgs ) do not contribute significantly in the far - infrared and taking @xmath47 @xcite , we use the 100 and 160  @xmath9 m infrared - hi correlation coefficients to estimate the big grains temperature @xmath48 of each hi component @xmath49 and the dust emissivities at 160  @xmath9 m : @xmath50 . the big grain temperature and the 160  @xmath9 m emissivity of each hi component",

    "the values for the local interstellar medium deduced from the cobe data @xcite are @xmath57  k and @xmath58  @xmath56 .",
    "the values of @xmath59 and @xmath60  @xmath56 per h atom found for the local component are in very good agreement ( within 1@xmath1 uncertainties ) with the average values found for the solar neighborhood by @xcite using cobe data : @xmath61  k and @xmath62 @xmath56 per h atom .",
    "this is an important validation of the photometric accuracy of the sst - mips data . on the other hand dust in the hvc",
    "is found to be significantly colder than in the local interstellar medium , even at the 3@xmath1 limit ( @xmath63 ) , which is consistant with a lower radiation field than in the solar neighborhood due to its distance to the galaxy @xcite .",
    "in addition we report an emissivity @xmath64 higher in the hvc than in the local ism ( see table  [ table_dust ] ) .",
    "an eventual contribution of vsgs to the far - infrared emission would have the effect of lowering @xmath39 and increasing @xmath64 even more .    for dust properties typical of the local interstellar medium",
    ", @xmath42 should be proportional to the dust - to - gas mass ratio which , for standard metal depletion on grains , would scale with the metallicity .",
    "the fact that @xmath65 ( 3@xmath1 ) is greater than the metallicity in complex c ( @xmath66 according to @xcite ) could indicate a dust ( and therefore gas ) column density in complex c more than 5 times larger than given by the hi emission .",
    "could it be dust associated with ionised gas ?",
    "h@xmath67 and other ionised atomic lines have been detected in several hvcs .",
    "it is expected to come from a photoionized layer at the surface of the clouds which plunge into the galactic halo .",
    "the column density of such a layer is @xmath68 @xmath4 in complex c @xcite which is similar to the hi column density in the hvc seen in xfls and therefore not enough to explain the high infrared emissivity measured here .",
    "in addition only the ionised gas spatially correlated with the hi would contribute to the infrared emissivity .",
    "could it be dust associated with diffuse h@xmath69 ?",
    "two detections of h@xmath69 in absorption with fuse have been reported but the column densities are much lower than those of hi @xcite .",
    "other attemps have been unsuccesful ; co was not found in emission @xcite nor hco@xmath70 in absorption @xcite .",
    "furthermore abundance measurements in hvcs show no sign of iron depletion @xcite which has been used as a strong argument in favor of very low dust in hvcs .    to reconcile our findings with previous work we suggest that hvcs could be multiphase gas including small and dense molecular clumps with a low surface filling factor ( and therefore undetected with pencil beam absorption observations ) bathing in a diffuse phase seen in absorption .",
    "the dust emission reported here would mainly originate in these clumps , spatially correlated with hi , which would have a larger iron depletion than in the diffuse phase of hvcs .",
    "evidence of the existence of such small molecular clumps was found in cirrus clouds @xcite and in the magellanic stream @xcite .",
    "additional observations of hvcs with the spitzer space telescope are needed to confirm our result .    if our result reveals a general property of hvcs , it would mean that their mass is much larger than what can be inferred from hi observations and that most of the gas is in a dense phase .",
    "an infall of 1 m@xmath71/year is needed to explain the star formation rate , the distribution of stellar metallicities with age and the presence of a bar in the milky way and in other galaxies .",
    "the current idea is that this infalling gas is diffuse ( ionised and neutral ) resulting from the cooling of very hot halo gas .",
    "our result changes this picture by showing that most of the infalling gas is in dense and cold clumps , leaving open the question of the origin and stability of such structures .",
    "hvcs typically contribute to @xmath72 of the hi column density at high latitude , but with its temperature lower than in the local interstellar medium , dust in hvcs could contribute a much larger fraction to the sub - millimeter and millimeter emission .",
    "observations in this wavelength range , with herschel and planck for instance , could be used as a tracer of the column density of hvcs and as a distance indicator , using the dust temperature to put constraints on the radiation field strength .",
    "if the detection presented in this study is confirmed and is typical of hvcs , it could also have a strong impact on the analysis of observational cosmology data ( e.g. wmap , planck ) that do not to this day take this foreground component into account .",
