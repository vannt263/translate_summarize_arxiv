    "at present the physics community is actively trying to find ways to differentiate a neutron star made up entirely of nuclear matter from one with a color superconducting @xcite quark matter core .",
    "compact stars typically have very large magnetic fields .",
    "hence any predicted signature of a color superconducting core should take into account the presence of the star s magnetic field and its effects in the superconducting state .",
    "given that magnetars can have surface fields as large as @xmath1 g @xcite , it is reasonable to expect that the star s interior fields can reach even higher values .",
    "maximum strengths of @xmath2 g are allowed by a simple application of the virial theorem @xcite .",
    "although a color superconductor ( cs ) is in principle an electric superconductor , because the diquark condensate carries nonzero electric charge , in the color - flavor - locked ( cfl ) phase @xcite ( cfl is the color superconducting phase that realizes in a system of three - flavor massless quarks at high densities ) there is no meissner effect for a new in - medium electromagnetic field @xmath3 .",
    "this in - medium electromagnetic field -called in the literature a `` rotated '' electromagnetic field , where the `` rotation '' takes place in an inner space- is a combination of the regular electromagnetic field and the @xmath4 gluon @xcite .",
    "as the quark pairs are all neutral with respect to the `` rotated '' electromagnetic charge @xmath5 , the `` rotated '' electromagnetic field @xmath3 remains long - range within the superconductor .",
    "in this paper we are interested in the color - superconducting magnetic phases that realize in a very dense system of three - flavor massless quarks interacting in the background of a rotated magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "as shown in ref @xcite , the color - superconducting properties of such a system are substantially affected by the penetrating @xmath6 field and as a consequence , a new phase , called magnetic color flavor locked ( mcfl ) phase @xcite , takes place . in the mcfl phase the pairing of ( rotated ) electrically charged quarks",
    "is reinforced by the field .",
    "pairs of this kind have bounding energies which depend on the magnetic - field strength and are bigger than the ones existing at zero field . at field strengths of the order of the baryon chemical potential , the pairing reinforcement is sufficient to produce a distinguishable splitting of the gap in two pieces : one that only gets contributions from pairs of neutral quarks and one that gets contributions from both pairs of neutral and pairs of charged quarks .",
    "although the symmetry breaking patterns of the mcfl and cfl phases are different , the two phases are hardly distinguishable at weak magnetic fields . in the cfl phase the symmetry breaking",
    "is given by @xmath7 this symmetry reduction leaves nine goldstone bosons : a singlet associated to the breaking of the baryonic symmetry @xmath8 , and an octet associated to the axial @xmath9 group .",
    "once a magnetic field is switched on , the difference between the electric charge of the @xmath10 quark and that of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 quarks reduces the original flavor symmetry of the theory and consequently also the symmetry group remaining after the diquark condensate is formed .",
    "then , the breaking pattern for the mcfl - phase @xcite becomes @xmath13 the group @xmath14 ( not to be confused with the usual anomaly @xmath15 ) is related to the current which is an anomaly - free linear combination of @xmath12 , @xmath11 , and @xmath10 axial currents @xcite . in this case",
    "only five goldstone bosons remain .",
    "three of them correspond to the breaking of @xmath16 , one to the breaking of @xmath14 , and one to the breaking of @xmath8 .",
    "thus , an applied magnetic field reduces the number of goldstone bosons in the superconducting phase , from nine to five .",
    "the mcfl phase is not just characterized by a smaller number of goldstone fields , but by the fact that all these bosons are neutral with respect to the rotated electric charge .",
    "hence , no charged low - energy excitation can be produced in the mcfl phase .",
    "this effect can be relevant for the low energy physics of a color superconducting star s core and hence for its transport properties . in particular , the cooling of a compact star is determined by the particles with the lowest energy ; so a star with a core of quark matter and sufficiently large magnetic field can have a distinctive cooling process .",
    "more recently , we have found that the magnetic field can also influence the gluon dynamics @xcite . at field strengths comparable to the charged gluon meissner mass a new phase",
    "can be realized giving rise to an inhomogeneous condensate of @xmath5-charged gluons @xcite .",
    "the gluon condensate anti - screens the magnetic field due to the anomalous magnetic moment of these spin-1 particles .",
    "because of the anti - screening , this condensate does not give a mass to the @xmath5 photon , but instead amplifies the applied rotated magnetic field .",
    "this means that at such applied fields the cs behaves as a paramagnet , thus we named this phase paramagnetic cfl ( pcfl ) @xcite .",
    "this last effect is also of interest for astrophysics .",
    "compact stars with color superconducting cores could have larger magnetic fields than neutron stars made up entirely of nuclear matter , thanks to the gluon vortex antiscreening mechanism .",
    "the above state of affairs underlines the need to discern the scales and field strengths at which one or another magnetic phase is physically relevant . if one ignores the quark masses , the main scales of the color superconductor are the baryon chemical potential @xmath17 , the dynamically generated gluon mass @xmath18 and the gap parameter @xmath19 , with @xmath20 a constant that is dominated by magnetic gluon exchanges @xcite .",
    "we can assume that at sufficiently high @xmath17 , the running strong coupling @xmath21 becomes @xmath22 , so the the hierarchy of the scales is @xmath23 .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to elucidate how the different magnetic phases are related to the fundamental scales of the cs .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "[ low - energy theory ] we develop the cfl low - energy effective theory in a magnetic background using a lorentz covariant formalism . in this derivation",
    "the rotated magnetic field is introduced only through covariant derivatives , thus preserving the @xmath24 gauge invariance .",
    "the threshold rotated magnetic field that decouples the charged mesons from the low - energy theory is found in sec .",
    "[ threshold - field ] . in sec .",
    "[ mag - phases ] we discuss how the different magnetic phases are realized in a hierarchical order determined by the main energy scales of the cs . in the concluding",
    "remarks we state the major outcomes of the paper and discuss possible astrophysical implications of the realization of a pcfl - like phase at moderate densities .",
    "the physics at energies below the lower scale @xmath25 can be explored by constructing the effective low - energy theory in the presence of a rotated magnetic field . since in the cfl phase",
    "all the fermions are gapped and all the gluons have dynamically generated masses , the low energy theory of the cs is governed by the goldstone modes arising from the breaking of the global symmetries in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , once a magnetic field is present , the original symmetry group @xmath26 is reduced , due to the different electric charges of the quarks , to @xmath27 .",
    "one would think that the low energy theory should correspond to the breaking pattern ( [ mcfl ] ) , hence be described by five neutral goldstone bosons .",
    "however , it is clear that at very weak magnetic fields the symmetry of the cfl phase can be treated as a good approximated symmetry , meaning that at weak fields the low - energy excitations are essentially governed by nine approximately massless scalars ( those of the breaking pattern ( [ cfl ] ) ) instead of five .",
    "a question of order here is : what do we exactly understand as a very weak magnetic field ?",
    "in other words , what is the threshold - field strength that effectively separates the cfl low energy behavior from the mcfl one ?",
    "a fundamental clue in this direction will come from the determination of the term in the low - energy cfl lagrangian that can generate a field - induced mass for the charged goldstone fields , disconnecting them from the low - energy dynamics at some field strength and thereby effectively reducing the number of goldstone bosons from the nine of the cfl phase , to the five of the mcfl .",
    "a similar approach was previously followed in ref .",
    "@xcite . nevertheless , as it will become clear below",
    ", our treatment and results will differ from those previously obtained .",
    "our strategy will consist of writing the effective low energy lagrangian for the goldstone bosons corresponding to the cfl breaking pattern ( [ cfl ] ) , but in the presence of an external @xmath6 field , that is , ignoring the explicit breaking introduced by the electromagnetic interaction . to ensure that this lagrangian is `` invariant '' with respect to the original group of the cfl case , one treats the charge operator as a spurion field @xcite , and assume it transforms conveniently under left / right flavor symmetries , as well as under the color symmetries , depending on whether the operator appears with flavor or color indexes , as it will be shown below .",
    "there are two important points that separate our treatment from previous works .",
    "one is that we give the general form of the low - energy lagrangian in an arbitrary reference frame , that is , we introduce all the possible covariant structures that can be formed at finite density and in the presence of an external magnetic field .",
    "when taken in the rest frame , the lagrangian naturally reproduces the different lorentz structures that characterize the problem with external magnetic field at finite density .",
    "the other is that when proposing the allowed terms of the low energy lagrangian , we take into account that the coupling of the charged mesons with a rotated electromagnetic field can be traced back to the coupling of the fermions with the field .",
    "this coupling only occurs within a covariant derivative to preserve the gauge invariance of the theory under the @xmath28 group .",
    "then , the coupling between the goldstone bosons and the rotated electromagnetic field always occurs within a covariant derivative too .",
    "we will show that in this @xmath28 gauge invariant approach , the charged goldstone bosons acquire field - induced masses that appear at the leading order of the low - energy theory .    to find the effective low - energy theory",
    ", we can follow a similar method to that used at zero field in refs .",
    "we start by introducing two scalar fields which describe the fluctuations of the diquark condensates , and are associated to left and right order parameters : @xmath29 where @xmath30 denote flavor indices , @xmath31 denote color indices , and @xmath32 denote left / right chirality , respectively . under an @xmath33 rotation ,",
    "the above fields transform as @xmath34 with @xmath35 , and @xmath36 .",
    "the expectation values of the @xmath37 and @xmath38 fields define the ground state of the cfl phase which produces the symmetry breaking @xmath39 .",
    "we are interested in the fluctuations of the phases of the order parameters .",
    "therefore , we can factor out the norm of the order parameters in ( [ x ] ) and work with unitary @xmath37 and @xmath38 scalar fields . although the axial group @xmath15 is anomalous at low densities",
    ", it becomes an approximate symmetry at high densities due to the suppression of the instanton interactions that produce the anomaly .",
    "nevertheless , in our derivations neither the pseudo goldstone mode associated to the breaking of this group , nor the goldstone mode associated to the @xmath40-baryon symmetry breaking will be considered , as these bosons are both neutral with respect to the rotated electromagnetic charge , and therefore irrelevant for the analysis of the present paper ( we refer the interested reader to ref .",
    "@xcite to find out the contributions of these modes to the low energy theory ; see also ref .",
    "@xcite for the diquark excitations of the cfl ground state at zero magnetic field in the framework of a nambu - jona - lasinio model ) .",
    "we can introduce the goldstone canonical fields @xmath41 with @xmath42 being the @xmath43 generators normalized to satisfy @xmath44=\\frac{1}{2}\\delta_{ab}\\ ] ] thus , x and y together contain a total of sixteen scalar fields .",
    "strictly speaking only eight of them are genuine goldstone bosons , that is , massless scalar fields associated to the breaking of global symmetries .",
    "the other eight are higgs fields related to the spontaneous breaking of the color gauge group su(3 ) that gives mass to the gluons and therefore can be always eliminated from the theory by choosing a convenient ( unitary ) gauge @xcite . since these considerations remain valid in the presence of the external magnetic field , we will work in the unitary gauge and concentrate our analysis into the derivation of the low energy theory for the genuine goldstone bosons .    at zero magnetic field",

    "two important changes occur when a @xmath6 field is switch on .",
    "first , the derivatives should be replaced by covariant derivatives containing the rotated electromagnetic potential @xmath3 associated to the magnetic field @xmath6 .",
    "second , the number of fundamental tensors available in the theory increases , because of the extra tensor @xmath53 . as a consequence",
    ", we can construct an effective theory containing a larger number of independent terms which are quadratic in the ( covariant ) derivative .",
    "the covariant derivative should be consistent with the fact that the vev of the diquark fields , which only get contribution from the diagonal elements of the order parameter matrix , are all neutral in the rotated charge .",
    "we can generically denote the @xmath54 order parameter matrix by @xmath25 .",
    "taking into account that a rotated electromagnetic field is a combination of the @xmath4-gluon field and the conventional electromagnetic field and that each element of the order parameter matrix carries an electric charge equal to the sum of the electric charges of the quarks forming the corresponding pair , we can write the covariant derivative as @xmath55\\delta=[\\partial_{\\mu}-\\frac{i\\sqrt{3}}{2}gg_{\\mu}^{8}(q\\times \\mathbf{1})-iea_{\\mu}(\\mathbf{1}\\times q)]\\delta\\ ] ] where the direct products denote ( color @xmath56 flavor ) .",

    "now we are ready to determine the strength of the threshold field for which the effective symmetry transmutation from cfl to mcfl occurs .",
    "for that aim , it is convenient to work in momentum space . transforming to momentum space in the presence of the magnetic field",

    "we are assuming that the interactions between the goldstone bosons and the quasiparticles are described by a yukawa term that originates within a njl - type model .",
    "some authors ( see @xcite for details ) have argued that the microscopic structure of the ng bosons in the cfl phase should be that of a quartic - quark state . in the quartic - quark picture",
    "the threshold would presumably be four times the gap energy . within the njl - approach , the threshold field where the number of stable goldstone bosons effectively changes , thus the symmetry of the cfl phase can not longer been treated as a good approximated symmetry is given by @xmath140 where we used the weak - field approximation @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "contrary to the result found in @xcite , our threshold field does not depend on the decay constant @xmath142 , therefore it depends on @xmath17 only through @xmath73 .",

    "we get @xmath144 . at these field strengths ,",
    "the charged mesons decouple from the low - energy theory .",
    "when this decoupling occurs , the five neutral goldstone bosons ( including the one associated to the baryon symmetry breaking ) that characterize the mcfl phase will drive the low - energy physics of the system .",
    "therefore , coming from low to higher fields , the first magnetic phase that effectively shows up in the magnetized system will be the mcfl , even though at fields near the threshold field the splitting of the gaps found at much stronger fields @xcite may still be negligible .",
    "we underline that the phenomenon occurring at the threshold field ( [ threshold - value ] ) is not a phase transition , as no symmetry is broken there . at any nonzero magnetic field strength , below or above the threshold field ( [ threshold - value ] ) , the symmetry of the system is , strictly speaking , that of the mcfl .",
    "however , at @xmath145 the charged goldstone bosons are so light that the observable impact of the smaller symmetry of the mcfl phase , compared to that of cfl , is irrelevant and the nine goldstone bosons of the cfl phase provide a good approximated description of the low - energy physics .",
    "based on these considerations we choose to call the cfl - mcfl transition a symmetry transmutation .    on the other hand",
    ", it is worth to call attention to the analogy between the cfl - mcfl transmutation and what could be called a `` field - induced '' mott transition .",

    "later on , mott transitions have been also discussed in qcd to describe delocalization of bound states into their constituents at a temperature defined as the mott temperature @xcite . by definition ,",

    "both spatial symmetries -the rotational symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the applied magnetic field and the translational symmetry- are broken by the vortex state .",
    "it turns out that , contrary to what occurs in conventional type - ii superconductors , where the applied magnetic field only penetrates through flux tubes and with a smaller strength than that of the applied field , the gluon vortex state exhibits a paramagnetic behavior .",

    "this antiscreening behavior is similar to that found in the electroweak system at high magnetic field @xcite .",
    "hence , since the @xmath5 photons remain long - range in the presence of the condensate @xmath155 , the @xmath24 symmetry remains unbroken . at asymptotically large densities , because @xmath159 , we have @xmath160 for each @xmath17 value .",

    "since the ground state at moderately high densities has not yet been investigated in the presence of a magnetic field , this region is indicated by question marks . ]    at fields @xmath162 the density of states on the fermi surface of the charged quarks will be larger than that of neutral quarks @xcite . because of the different density of states , the magnitude of the gap receiving contributions from pairs of rotated charged quarks will split from the magnitude of the gap receiving contributions only from pairs of rotated neutral quarks , as shown to happen , without taking into account the vortex state , in ref .",
    "the splitting of the gaps at this scale , however , would not break any new symmetry that has not been already broken at much lower scales .",
    "hence , no new phase transition occurs at fields of order @xmath163 .    for fields much larger than @xmath161 , i.e. sufficiently strong as to surpass all the energy scales of the system",
    ", the quark infrared dynamics will become predominant , and the phenomenon of magnetic catalysis of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite will be activated , producing a phase that favors quark - antiquark condensates over quark - quark condensates .",
    "however , the exploration of this region goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] provides a qualitative sketch of the magnetic phases that exist at asymptotically high densities in the framework of a three - flavor color superconductor . in that region , at very weak magnetic fields , the color superconducting state is practically described by the cfl phase , because the charged mesons , although massive , are so light that they can not decay in pairs of quasiparticle - quasihole .",
    "when the field strength is of the order of the quarks energy gap , the charged mesons become heavy enough to decouple and the low - energy physics is indeed that of the mcfl phase , where five neutral massless bosons drive the low - energy behavior . at fields comparable to the magnetic masses of the charged gluons",
    ", a chromomagnetic instability is developed for these gluons leading to the formation of a vortex state and the antiscreening of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the vortex state breaks the translational symmetry , as well as the remaining rotational symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the applied magnetic field , hence the vortex formation corresponds to a phase transition from the mcfl to a pcfl phase .    the chemical potential @xmath164 in fig.[fig1 ] is used to schematically separate the regions where the effects of an s - quark mass @xmath165 can ( right of @xmath164 ) or can not ( left of @xmath164 ) be neglected .",
    "the region of moderately high densities to the left of @xmath164 along the zero - magnetic - field line has been subjected to intense scrutiny in the literature @xcite-@xcite , as this is the most important region for applications of cs in realistic systems as compact stars .",
    "a main problem has been to find the stable phase at these moderately high densities . despite many clever propositions that include a modified @xmath166-phase with a condensate of kaons @xcite ; a loff phase on which the quarks pair with nonzero total momentum @xcite ; as well as homogeneous @xcite and inhomogeneous @xcite gluon condensate phases , it is still unclear which of these phases produces the lowest free energy . given that nobody has yet studied this question at finite magnetic field , we choose to indicate it in the figure with question marks .",
    "summarizing , in a color superconductor with three - flavor quarks at very high densities an increasing magnetic field produces a phase transmutation from cfl to mcfl first , and then a phase transition from mcfl to pcfl . during the phase transmutation",
    "no symmetry breaking occurs , since in principle once a magnetic field is present the symmetry is theoretically that of the mcfl , as discussed above .",
    "however , in practice for @xmath167 the mcfl phase is almost indistinguishable from the cfl . only at fields comparable to @xmath168 the main features of mcfl emerge through the low - energy behavior of the system . at the threshold field @xmath148 ,",
    "only five neutral goldstone bosons remain out of the original nine characterizing the low - energy behavior of the cfl phase .",
    "these are precisely the five goldstone bosons determining the new low - energy behavior of the genuinely realized mcfl phase .",
    "going from mcfl to pcfl is , on the other hand , a real phase transition @xcite , as the translational symmetry , as well as the remaining rotational symmetry in the plane perpendicular to the applied magnetic field are broken by the vortex state .    throughout this paper",
    "we have ignored the effects due to quark masses because we assumed very large baryon density . however , the densities of interest for most astrophysical applications are just moderately high . at moderate densities",
    "the s - quark mass can and do play an important role @xcite . in this case , the color superconductor develops chromomagnetic instabilities even in the absence of an external magnetic field @xcite . at even lower densities , where the s - quark decouples due to its larger mass , a two - flavor color superconductivity -the so - called 2cs phase- realizes . in this phase , when color neutrality and @xmath169 equilibrium conditions are imposed , some chromomagnetic instabilities can also develop at certain density values @xcite .",
    "finding the stable superconducting ground state at moderate densities is one of the main questions in the field at the present moment @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the understanding of this problem in the presence of a magnetic field , which no doubt is another crucial player in the physical scenario of a compact star , is also an important open question . in this regard , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the removal of the chromomagnetic instabilities found at moderate densities in the two - flavor system may be related to the _ spontaneous generation _ of an inhomogeneous gluon condensate with a corresponding induced magnetic field .",
    "if this proposition is proved to be correct also for the three - flavor case , the star s core could be in a pcfl - like magnetic phase , even if the core s original magnetic field is zero or relatively low .",
    "that is , the pcfl - like phase will not be triggered by instabilities produced at a critical value of some pre - existing inner magnetic field , but by instabilities connected to the interplay of the neutrality conditions and the s - quark mass at some baryon density .",
    "an interesting consequence of a pcfl core is that a star s core in this phase can generate and/or boost its inner magnetic field .",
    "exploring the magnetic phases that realize at realistic densities is an important pending task .",
    "it is plausible that if compact stars are the natural playground for color superconductivity , the magnetic phases described in this paper , or more precisely , the version of these phases at more realistic densities , may be relevant for the physics of the core of highly magnetized compact objects like magnetars @xcite , and the so - called central compact objects ( cco ) @xcite .",
    "cco are point - like sources located near the center of supernova remnants that can not be identified as active radio pulsars or magnetars @xcite",
    ". some of them may have magnetar s strength b fields and much smaller radii .",
    "for typical neutron star masses @xmath170 , a smaller radii means a denser star s core ; the denser the core , the greater the chance it can be in a color superconducting phase . magnetars surface magnetic fields are typically in the range of @xmath171 , and the fields at their much denser cores can probably reach even larger values .",
    "any of these compact objects could be a candidate for the realization of a color superconducting phase in a highly magnetized background .",
    "moreover , the standard explanation of the origin of the magnetars large magnetic fields can not explain all the features of the supernova remnants surrounding these objects @xcite .",
    "magnetars are supposed to be created by a magnetohydrodynamic - dynamo mechanism that amplifies a seed magnetic field due to a rapid rotating ( spin period @xmath172 ) protoneutron star .",
    "part of this rotating energy is supposed to power the supernova through rapid magnetic braking , implying that the supernova remnants associated with magnetars should be an order of magnitude more energetic than typical supernova remnants .",
    "however recent calculations @xcite indicate that their energies are similar .",
    "in addition , one would expect that when a magnetar spins down , the rotational energy output should go into a magnetized particle wind of ultrarelativistic electrons and positrons that radiate via synchrotron emission across the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , so far nobody has detected the expected luminous pulsar wind nebulae around magnetars @xcite .",
    "although more observations are needed to confirm the above , current observations indicate that alternative models to the standard magnetar model @xcite need to be considered .",
    "for example , some authors @xcite have suggested that magnetars could be the outcome of a stellar progenitor with highly magnetized cores .",
    "a progenitor star with a pcfl - like core would be capable to induce and/or enhance the star s magnetic field due to the antiscreening mechanism inherent to this color superconducting phase @xcite , and as such provides an alternative to the observational conundrum of the standard magnetar s paradigm @xcite .    only after the stable color - superconducting phase at moderate densities is well established with and without an external magnetic field , we will be in a well - grounded position to investigate and reliably predict observable signatures of color superconductivity in compact stars .",
