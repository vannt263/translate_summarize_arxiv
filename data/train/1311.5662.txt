    "the propagation of primeval acoustic waves in the coupled photon - baryon plasma before recombination @xcite generates a distinct pattern of temperature and polarization anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "these have been measured with unprecedented accuracy by observations of the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) @xcite and more recently by the planck satellite @xcite .",
    "a similar imprint is present in the late time distribution of large - scale structures in the form of an oscillatory pattern in the matter power spectrum , the so - called baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) .",
    "these have been detected using measurements of two - point galaxy correlation function from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite and the galaxy power spectrum from the 2-degree field ( 2df ) survey @xcite .",
    "cmb observations have accurately determined the distance travelled by acoustic waves at decoupling ( i.e. the sound horizon ) .",
    "thus , the detection of bao in the galaxy distribution can be used as a standard ruler to estimate the angular diameter distance as well as the hubble rate at redshifts probed by galaxy surveys ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a new generation of galaxy surveys has been designed to measure the bao at different redshifts to few percent error from which it will be possible to infer stringent bounds on the cosmological parameters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this demands for equally accurate cosmological model predictions .    in the linear regime of cosmic structure formation",
    "bao appear as a series of damped oscillations superimposed to the broadband shape of the matter power spectrum .",
    "these can be computed to the desired level of accuracy using linear perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "however , at low redshifts the onset of the non - linear clustering of matter induces deviations from the linear theory which are much harder to predict .",
    "such non - linearities degrade the bao pattern by altering the amplitude , shape and position of the extrema as well as the broadband slope of the power spectrum .",
    "if not accounted these effects can alter the cosmological parameter inference ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "non - linear effects have been investigated using numerical n - body simulations in numerous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "alternatively , semi - analytical approaches have been developed to compute the non - linear modifications of the matter power spectrum at intermediate scales @xcite .",
    "the comparison with n - body simulations has shown these to provide accurate predictions on bao scales below @xmath6  h@xmath7mpc ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , bao occur on a relatively large scale ( @xmath8  h@xmath7mpc ) with a shape that depends on small - scale lagrangian displacements @xmath9  h@xmath7mpc @xcite .",
    "hence , the main limitation of numerical studies is due to sample variance errors on the one hand and the lack of large dynamical range on the other hand .",
    "for instance , @xcite have used a series of 5000 simulations with @xmath10 particles with box size @xmath11  h@xmath7gpc from @xcite corresponding to an effective volume of @xmath12  h@xmath7gpc@xmath13 .",
    "this allows them to drastically reduce sample variance errors on the matter power spectrum , nevertheless these are still nearly twice as large as cosmic variance uncertainty , while bao remain under sampled in fourier space .",
    "because of this , n - body studies of the effects of non - linearities on the bao have been mainly estimated from functional fits to the numerical power spectrum .",
    "furthermore , averaging over a large ensemble of simulations does not resolve the problem of numerical systematics that needs to be carefully addressed especially when statistical errors are reduced to the percent level .",
    "these can be particularly important in the case of low mass and spatial resolution runs such as those from @xcite . to date",
    ", n - body simulation studies of the bao accurate to per - cent level are still missing .",
    "the work presented here aims to fill this gap . to this purpose",
    "we use a large volume n - body simulation of a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology from the dark energy universe simulation - full universe runs ( deus - fur ) @xcite .",
    "this is one of the three deus - fur simulations of dark energy models with @xmath14 particles and box length of @xmath15  h@xmath7gpc .",
    "the size of the simulation box allows us to derive cosmic variance limited predictions for the matter power spectrum .",
    "however , in order to control the effect of numerical systematics we perform a convergence study using a set of n - body simulations for which we have varied several numerical simulation parameters .",
    "the combined analysis allows us for the first time to determine the effect of non - linearities on all bao peaks and troughs between redshift @xmath1 and @xmath16 to @xmath3 accuracy level ( and in bins of size @xmath5 ) .",
    "it is in this redshift interval that the power spectrum is most difficult to predict . on the other hand it is",
    "the probed range of current and future observational missions ( to give an idea the median redshift of the planned euclid survey is @xmath17 ) .",
    "we use the deus - fur power spectrum to test the validity of semi - analytical models on the bao scale .",
    "in addition , we precisely characterize the non - linear modifications of the bao extrema without resorting to curve - fitting procedures .",
    "we show that the shift of the position of the bao extrema remains a few percent effect at all redshift .",
    "in contrast , the damping of the bao amplitude is the dominant modification induced by the non - linear clustering of matter .",
    "this evolves as function of redshift proportionally to the linear growth rate , thus suggesting that measurements of the amplitude of bao extrema at different redshifts can be used as an independent cosmological probe carrying information on the linear growth of structures .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ nbody ]",
    "we summarize the characteristics of the n - body simulations used in our analysis , while in section  [ error ] we present a detailed study of the statistical and systematic errors affecting the measurement of the matter power spectrum . in section  [ bao ]",
    "we define the bao spectrum and discuss the comparison against semi - analytical models . in section  [ bao_nl ]",
    "we quantify the non - linear effects on the position and amplitude of the bao extrema and the coupling to the broadband slope of the power spectrum .",
    "finally , we discuss our conclusion in section  [ conclu ] .",
    "we use the deus - fur simulation of a flat @xmath0cdm cosmology best - fit to the wmap-7yr data @xcite .",
    "this has been realized using the application amadeus  a multi - purpose application for dark energy universe simulation  expressly developed for the deus - fur project @xcite .",
    "gaussian initial conditions using the zeldovich approximation have been generated with an optimized version of the code mpgrafic @xcite .",
    "the n - body run has been performed with a version of ramses @xcite that has been specifically improved to run on a large number of cores ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "this is an adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) code with a tree - based structure that allows for recursive refinements above a user - defined density threshold .",
    "the n - body solver evolves particles using a particle - mesh ( pm ) method , while the poisson equation is solved with a multigrid technique @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the algorithms , optimization schemes and the computing challenges involved with the realization of deus - fur is given in @xcite , while the characteristics of the three deus - fur simulations of dark energy models will be presented in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the box length of the deus - fur simulations is set to @xmath19h@xmath7gpc , thus enclosing the horizon diameter of the three simulated cosmologies ( @xmath20h@xmath7gpc in @xmath0cdm ) .",
    "these simulations employ @xmath14 particles and a coarse grid of @xmath14 resolution elements with @xmath21 levels of refinement , reaching a formal mass resolution of @xmath22  h@xmath7m@xmath23 and a spatial resolution of @xmath24h@xmath7kpc ( corresponding roughly to the mass and size of the milky way ) .",
    "the initial redshift is set to @xmath25 , hence sufficiently high to avoid transient effects which occur in the case of a late start of the initial conditions using the zeldovich approximation @xcite .",
    "the refinement threshold is set to @xmath26 such as to limit the total amount of amr cells generated during the run ( and the associated memory usage ) without affecting the accuracy of the non - linear power spectrum calculation .",
    "the final count of amr cells is still of @xmath27 trillions .",
    "the model parameters of the simulated @xmath0cdm - w7 are quoted in table  [ cosmo ] , while the characteristics of the deus - fur simulation are listed in table  [ deusfur ] .",

    "[ cosmo ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the inaccuracy in reproducing the broadband slope of the non - linear matter power spectrum is primarily responsible for the discrepancies between the semi - analytic model predictions and the deus - fur spectrum .",
    "that is why subtracting the smooth wiggle - free spectrum predicted by each of the models provides a much better description .",
    "we quantify this effect by computing the average amplitude of neighbouring pairs of extrema .",
    "we plot the prediction for different models at @xmath1 relative to deus - fur in the bottom - left panel of figure  [ physics ] .",
    "we can see that the linear theory overestimates the average amplitude up to @xmath28 at @xmath29  h mpc@xmath7 , while it underestimates at larger @xmath30 .",
    "halofit and regpt are in agreement with deus - fur at @xmath3 level up to @xmath31  h mpc@xmath7 . at larger wavenumbers",
    "halofit remains within @xmath32 , while the prediction from regpt sharply falls to more than @xmath28 above @xmath33  h mpc@xmath7 .",
    "subtracting the wiggle - free spectrum of each model absorbs most of the broadband slope effect as shown in the bottom - right panel of figure  [ physics ] .",
    "discrepancies are now @xmath34 , however it is worth noticing a mode dependent trends which differ from one model to another .",
    "this indicates the presence of a residual coupling between the bao and the continuum which complicate the modelling of the non - linear effects on the bao .",
    "that is why defining a wiggle - free spectrum through a fit to the observed spectrum may introduce spurious effects at the percent level .",
    "we have presented a study of the bao in the real - space matter power spectrum from the deus - fur simulation of @xmath0cdm - w7 cosmology .",
    "the simulation box covers the size of the full observable volume of the simulated cosmology thus enabling a cosmic variance limited estimation of the matter power spectrum . using a testbed of large volume high - resolution simulations we are able to control numerical systematic errors to within @xmath3 .",
    "this allows us to investigate for the first time the full bao range ( @xmath4<0.3 $ ] ) at low redshift ( from @xmath1 to @xmath16 ) with less than @xmath3 systematic and statistical errors .",
    "previous works dedicated to assessing the effect of non - linearities on the bao have either relied on perturbation theory ( which eventually breaks down at large wavenumbers ) or used n - body simulations of smaller effective volumes without assessing the effect of numerical systematic errors .",
    "furthermore , differently from previous studies , the very narrow sampling in @xmath30 ( with bins of size @xmath5 ) accessible through deus - fur has allowed us to determine the characteristics of the bao extrema by directly measuring of the peaks and dips in the bao spectrum . in this case",
    "the choice of a wiggle - free spectrum necessary to define the bao is of particularly importance . here , rather than using fitting formulae that may introduce spurious effects and absorb part of the bao signal ,",
    "we have computed a smooth spectrum from a n - body simulation with an initial wiggle - free spectrum .",
    "such characteristics make the bao from deus - fur bao an optimal reference for testing semi - analytical model predictions and calibrate the amplitude of non - linear effects expected in a standard @xmath0cdm cosmology . to this purpose",
    "we provide in appendix  [ fit ] polynomial fitting formulae of the bao spectrum valid in the redshift interval @xmath35 , based on a decomposition of the non - linear effects in term of a shift of the bao extrema , a damping factor and a broadband slope .",
    "we have tested two widely used models , halofit @xcite and regpt @xcite .",
    "we find that halofit overestimates the amplitude of the bao by a large factor ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 for the three first peaks respectively ) .",
    "in contrast regpt accurately reproduce the bao spectrum up to @xmath39  h mpc@xmath7 beyond which discrepancies with respect to deus - fur diverge .",
    "this is mostly due to inaccurately predicting the broadband slope of the non - linear power spectrum .",
    "thus , subtracting a smooth spectrum as predicted using regpt leads to much smaller deviations .",
    "we have detected a small non - trivial coupling between bao and the broadband slope .",
    "furthermore , we have quantified the shift and damping of each bao extrema and determined their evolution as function of redshift .",
    "we find that at a given redshift the second and third trough are not affected by non - linearities and thus can provide unbiased measurements of the cosmic distances .",
    "the redshift dependence of the shift is proportional to @xmath40 , hence measurements of the shift of the bao extrema at different redshifts may test the linear growth factor .",
    "however , given the relatively small amplitude of the shift ( @xmath41 ) such measurements may turn to be very challenging even with future surveys .",
    "in contrast , the damping of the bao amplitude has much larger impact and varies with redshift proportionally to @xmath42 .",
    "hence , by measuring the ratio of peak - to - trough amplitude at two different redshifts , it should be possible to constrain the growth factor and infer additional cosmological constraints besides those encoded in the cosmic distance to the bao .",
    "the non - linear effects on the bao spectrum vary with the underlying cosmological model . in a future work",
    "we will investigate such dependency extending this analysis to the two other deus - fur simulations of non - standard dark energy models .",
    "we are particularly grateful to the team of engineers at tgcc for technical support .",
    "we are very thankful to romain teyssier ( ramses code ) , simon prunet & christophe pichon ( mpgrafic and powergrid ) for providing their original applications .",
    "we are also thankful to ravi sheth , martin crocce , francisco prada , chia - hsun chuang , atsushi taruya and fabrice roy for fruitful discussions .",
    "this work was granted access to hpc resources of tgcc , ccrt and idris through allocations made by genci ( grand quipement national de calcul intensif ) in the framework of the `` grand challenges '' deus and deuss .",
    "the research leading to these results has received funding from the european research council under the european community s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007- 2013 grant agreement no .",
    "we acknowledge support from the dim acav of the region ile de france .",
    "here , we provide a polynomial fitting formula to the deus - fur @xmath0cdm - w7 bao spectrum valid in the range @xmath43 to @xmath44  h mpc@xmath7 in the redshift interval @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "our template is inspired by that used in @xcite and formulated such as to preserve our decomposition of non - linear effects in terms of shift , damping and continuum .",
    "when using functional fitting formula the physical interpretation of this quantities may depend on the exact form of the assumed template , hence the comparison with equivalent quantities derived from other fitting functions should be carefully performed .",
    "for this reason , in our analysis of the bao we have preferred to measure the shift , damping and the continuum directly on the bao spectrum .",
