    "the ubiquitous korteveg de vries equation @xcite is a common approximation for several problems in nonlinear physics .",
    "one of these problems is the _ shallow water wave problem _ extensively studied during the last fifty years and described in many textbooks and monographs ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the kdv equation corresponds to the case when the water depth is constant .",
    "there have been numerous attempts to study nonlinear waves in the case of a non - flat bottom .",
    "one of the first attempts to incorporate bottom topography is due to mei and le mhaut  @xcite .",
    "however , the authors did not obtain any simple kdv - type equation . among the first papers treating a slowly varying bottom",
    "is grimshaw s paper @xcite .",
    "he obtained an asymptotic solution describing a slowly varying solitary wave above a slowly varying bottom . for small amplitudes",
    "the wave amplitude varies inversely as the depth .",
    "djordjevi and redekopp @xcite studied the development of packets of surface gravity waves moving over an uneven bottom .",
    "they derived the variable coefficient nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) for such waves and using expansion in a single small parameter they found fission of an envelope soliton .",
    "a similar approach was later developed by benilow and howlin .",
    "this fission from the nls has been found in other physical contexts @xcite .",
    "we point out papers @xcite as examples of approaches which combine linear and nonlinear theories .",
    "for instance , in @xcite the authors study long - wave scattering by piecewise - constant periodic topography for solitary - like wave pulses and for kdv solitons .",
    "another extensively investigated approach is the gardner equation ( sometimes called the forced kdv equation ) @xcite .",
    "unidirectional waves over a slowly varying bottom have been studied by van groeasen and pudjaprasetya within a hamiltonian approach . for a slowly varying bottom",
    ", they obtained a forced kdv - type equation .",
    "the discussion of that equation gives an increase of the amplitude and decrease of the wavelength when a solitary wave enters a shallower region .",
    "the green - naghdi equations follow when taking an appropriate average of vertical variables @xcite .",
    "another study of long wave propagation over a submerged 2-dimensional bump was recently presented in @xcite , albeit according to linear long - wave theory .",
    "recently , an interesting numerical study of solutions to the free - surface euler equations in the conformal - mapping formulation has been published by the team working within the multiwave project @xcite .",
    "the authors illustrate that approach by numerical results for soliton fission over a submerged step and supercritical stream over a submerged obstacle @xcite .    in this paper we briefly summarize the derivation of a kdv - type equation , second order in small parameters , containing terms from the bottom function , derived recently by two of us and rutkowski in @xcite .",
    "next we present some examples of the evolution of a kdv soliton according to that equation , obtained in numerical simulations , stressing changes of soliton s velocity and amplitude when the wave passes over an extended obstacle or hole .",
    "it is worth noting that the equation derived in @xcite is a kdv - like equation of the second order , a single evolution equation for surface waves which contains terms for a bottom variation . in this context",
    "see a paper by kichenassamy and olver `` existence and nonexistence of solitary wave solutions to higher - order model evolution equations '' @xcite .",
    "the authors claimed _ for most of higher - order models , but only those which reduce to kdv solitary waves in an appropriate scaling limit , solitary wave solutions of the appropiate form do not exist ! _ on the other hand burde @xcite presents solitary wave solutions of the higher - order kdv models for bi - directional water waves .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ probl ]",
    "the shallow water problem is set and expressed in non - dimensional variables .",
    "section [ deriv ] contains the derivation of the second order wave equation sligthly different from that presented in the previous paper @xcite .",
    "the existence of at least one conservation law is proved . in section [ nsol ]",
    "an analytic solution to the second order kdv - type equation with an even bottom is found .",
    "the solution has the single - soliton form .",
    "the possible existence of multi - soliton solutions for that equation is still an open question .",
    "section [ numer ] presents several cases of time evolution of the kdv soliton governed by the second order kdv - type equation with terms from an uneven bottom obtained in numerical simulations .",
    "in the standard approach to the shallow water wave problem , the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and the fluid motion to be irrotational . therefore a velocity potential @xmath0 is introduced .",
    "it satisfies the laplace equation with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "the laplace equation must be valid for the whole volume of the fluid , whereas the equations for boundary conditions are valid at the surface of the fluid and at the impenetrable bottom .",
    "the system of equations for the velocity potential @xmath1 , including its derivation , can be found in many textbooks , for instance , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "( 5.2a - d ) ) .",
    "a standard procedure consists in introducing two small parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a typical amplitude of a surface wave @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the depth of the container and @xmath7 is a typical wavelength of the surface waves .",
    "the parameters @xmath8 are the same as the parameters @xmath9 in @xcite , respectively . in these notations",
    "we follow the paper , where a systematic way for the derivation of wave equations of different orders is presented . in @xcite",
    "we introduced a third parameter @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the amplitude of bottom variation . with this new parameter",
    "we are able to consider the motion of surface waves over a non - flat bottom within the same perturbative approach as for derivation of kdv or higher - order kdv - like equations .",
    "[ f1 ]    in the following we limit our considerations to 2-dimensional flow , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the horizontal coordinate and @xmath14 is the vertical one ( this means translational symmetry with respect to @xmath15 axis ) .",
    "the geometry of the problem is sketched in fig .",
    "[ geom ] .    up to now",
    ", a generally small surface tension term has been neglected , but it can be taken into account . a third coordinate could also be included @xcite .",
    "it is convenient to study the problem in non - dimensional variables .",
    "the non - dimensional variables are defined as follows @xmath16    in the non - dimensional variables the set of hydrodynamic equations for 2-dimensional flow takes the following form ( henceforth all tildes have been omitted ) @xmath17 equation ( [ 2bs ] ) is the laplace equation , valid for the whole volume of the fluid .",
    "equations ( [ 4bs ] ) and ( [ 5bs ] ) are so called kinematic and dynamic boundary conditions at the surface , respectively . equation ( [ 6bs ] ) represents a boundary condition at the non - flat bottom .",
    "all subscripts denote partial derivatives with respect to particular variables , i.e.  @xmath18 and so on .    for the standard kdv case , the boundary condition at the bottom is @xmath19 .",
    "when the bottom varies , this condition ( in original variables ) has to be replaced by @xmath20 , which in non - dimensional variables takes the form ( [ 6bs ] ) .",
    "however , in order to ensure that the perturbative approach makes sense , we assume that nowhere are derivatives of @xmath21 very large .",
    "the details of the derivation of the nolinear wave equation for the function @xmath22 when the bottom is given by an arbitrary function @xmath21 are presented in a previous paper @xcite . in order to make this paper",
    "self - contained , the main points of that derivation are recalled here .",
    "the present derivation differs from the previous one because here all second order corrections are obtained in one step .",
    "however , the emphasis will be on some surprising features of the evolution of solitary waves governed by this equation as obtained by numerical simulations .    as in the standard approach ,",
    "the velocity potential is approximated in the form of the series @xmath23 in our derivation ( as in most ) the velocity potential is limited to a polynomial with @xmath24 and in the equations ( [ 2bs])-([6bs ] ) only terms up to second order in small parameters @xmath25 are retained .",
    "laplace equation ( [ 2bs ] ) allows us to express all @xmath26 functions by the derivatives @xmath27 and @xmath28 functions by the derivatives @xmath29 .    limiting the boundary condition at the bottom ( [ 6bs ] ) to the second order in small parameters ,",
    "i.e.  to @xmath30 one is able to express all functions @xmath31 by @xmath32 and their derivatives .",
    "( next term in ( [ 6bs ] ) is of the order of @xmath33 .",

    "equation ( [ 5bs ] ) is then differentiated with respect to @xmath13 and @xmath38 is substituted in place of @xmath39 in both equations . in this way a set of two coupled nonlinear differential equations is obtained which , in general , can be considered at different orders of the approximation .    keeping only terms up to",
    "second order ( to be consistent with the order of approximation used in the bottom boundary condition ) one arrives at the second order boussinesq system @xmath40 .",

    "however , the bottom boundary condition ( [ ord1 ] ) , which is the source of these terms , is already second order in @xmath44 . therefore we will treat all these terms on the same footing , as second order ones , i.e.  replacing @xmath45 by @xmath46 , during derivations and substituting @xmath47 in the final formulas .",
    "so , we consider equation ( [ 4hx ] ) in a slightly reformulated form @xmath48    it is now time to eliminate one of the variables , that is @xmath38 , in order to obtain a single equation for the wave shape @xmath49 . substituting @xmath50 ( i.e.  flat bottom ) and keeping only first order terms one easily obtains the kdv solution ( see , e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "c ) or ) . burde and sergyeyev have shown how to proceed with approximations of higher order , assuming the case of the flat bottom . in our paper",
    "@xcite the method of incorporating a variable bottom in the second order perturbative approach is presented .",
    "burde and sergyeyev showed how to eliminate sequentially the @xmath38 variable and obtain a single equation for @xmath49 for the higher order perturbative approach .",
    "their method consists in applying special properties of solutions to lower order equations for @xmath51 and @xmath5 in derivations of corrections to equations in the next order . in principle",
    "it can be applied up to an arbitrary order .    in order to obtain a single equation for the elevation function",
    ", we take the seond order trial function @xmath38 in the following form @xmath52 where @xmath53 are unknown functions of @xmath54 and their derivatives . insertion of the trial function ( [ wab2 ] ) into ( [ 5hx ] ) and ( [ 4hxa ] ) , use of the properties of the first order equation @xmath55 and rejection of higher order terms , yields a set of two equations containing derivatives of unknown functions . both of them contain only second order terms , as lower order terms cancel .",
    "then we substract these equations . because we can treat small parameters as independent of each other , the coefficients in front of @xmath56 vanish sparately .",
    "this procedure gives @xmath57 because the correction functions appear already in the second order , it is enough to use the zero order relation between their time and space derivatives .",
    "therefore we use @xmath58 ( like @xmath59 ) in all equations ( [ rr])- ( [ r3 ] ) , which allows us to integrate these equations and obtain analytic forms of all correction functions .",
    "the derivation of the correction term @xmath60 presented here differs from that in @xcite , where corrections @xmath61 where calculated first and @xmath60 was obtained in the next step .",
    "the final result is the same since differences only appear in third order .",
    "so , finally we obtain the equations ( restoring @xmath47 ) @xmath62 and @xmath63 the equation ( [ etaabd ] ) is possibly the first kdv - type equation containing terms originating from an uneven bottom in the lowest possible order .",
    "it is not yet clear whether analytical solutions of ( [ etaabd ] ) for some non flat cases of the bottom function @xmath21 can be found .",
    "it does seem that the inverse scattering transform method ( ist ) @xcite , so succesfull in the search of analytical solutions to the kdv equation , can not be applied to equation ( [ etaabd ] ) .",
    "however , numerical solutions , which have also inspired past analytical studies , for some particular initial conditions should be obtained relatively simply .",
    "the kdv equation posesses an infinite number of invariants , see , e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sec.5.1 ) , that is , functions of @xmath5 which are constants in time .",
    "do similar invariants exist for the second order equation ( [ etaabd ] ) ?",
    "indeed , there obviously is at least one such invariant , @xmath64 . to see this property",
    "it is enough to transform the equation ( [ etaabd ] ) to the form @xmath65 and integrate over the whole space . for the eq .",
    "( [ etaabd ] ) the function @xmath66 is @xmath67 if limits of @xmath54 and their space derivatives are zero or the same constants when @xmath68 , then the conservation law @xmath69 holds .",
    "it is clear that the same conservation law holds for the case @xmath50 , i.e. , for the second order equation with flat bottom .",
    "the existence of other invariants for wave motion described by the second order equation ( [ etaabd ] ) is still an open question .",
    "we are looking into it .",
    "we seek a solution to ( [ etaabd ] ) with @xmath50 , or @xmath70    assume the form of a soliton moving to the right , @xmath71 .",
    "we have , @xmath72 and ( [ etaab ] ) can be written as @xmath73 integrating , one obtains @xmath74    we look for a solution @xmath75 .    using ( [ eta2 ] ) and",

    "in our previous paper @xcite the first examples of numerical calculations for the time evolution of a kdv soliton according to the second order equation ( [ etaabd ] ) were presented . however , the examples for a non - flat bottom were limited to short time evolution . in this paper",

    "( [ etaabd ] ) to first order and flat bottom ) the amplitude of the soliton and its velocity is greater when the water depth is smaller .",
