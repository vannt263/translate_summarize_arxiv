    "the structure of molecular clouds has been characterized in numerous ways in the literature , including identifying discrete objects in the emission ( often termed clumps ) . by studying the properties of such clumps we hope to explore the properties of the cores , harboured by some of the clumps , which will go on to form stars .",

    "many different terminologies have been used to name clumps in molecular clouds , here we call any individual object identified using clumpfind a ` condensation ' , to emphasize that it may not collapse to form a star .    the data were smoothed to 0.25  spectrally to improve the signal to noise ratio but still maintain sufficient resolution to identify condensations with the narrowest anticipated line widths . at our assumed cloud temperatures ( 50 and 30  k for ngc 2024 and ngc 2071 respectively ) the @xmath1co line widths expected from thermal broadening alone ( @xmath36 are 0.4  for ngc 2024 and 0.3  for ngc 2071 . at this resolution ,",

    "previous studies of the clump distribution in the dust continuum emission of orion b have identified a factor of @xmath39 fewer condensations than we do from the @xmath1co emission ( j01 , j06 ) .",
    "this is probably because the scuba observations are not sensitive to flux on large - scales whereas the @xmath1co gas should trace this more ambient emission , which can account for the @xmath1co condensations identified which are not spatially associated with a dust clump .",

    "is given by the standard deviation of the pixel co - ordinate values about the centroid position , weighted by the pixel values , then corrected to remove the effect of instrumental smoothing .",
