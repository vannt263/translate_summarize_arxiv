    "the introduction of large - size ccds has made this kind of investigations possible . with these detectors",
    "it is also possible to obtain deep photometry for the nearest globulars , and therefore to probe their mass functions over large mass intervals , in order to reach those ms stars which are more sensitive to dynamical effects ( e.g. pryor et al . 1986 ) .",
    "a rich sample of stars is also essential in order to reveal and study the shortest - lived ( and hence poorly known ) phases of the stellar evolution ( renzini & buzzoni 1986 ) .",
    "furthermore , the interactions between the single stars affect their evolution ( e.g. djorgovski et al . 1991 ) . to establish the reliability of the stellar evolutionary models , we must therefore ascertain to what extent a gc colour  magnitude diagram and luminosity function is changed by the interactions among its stars .    for the above reasons , our group started a project aimed at studying a number of globular clusters covering a wide range of the relevant parameters .",
    "ngc  1851 ( @xmath18 ; @xmath19 ) has been selected for its position and its concentration .",
    "its galactocentric distance , which is about twice that of the sun , and its distance of 7.1  kpc from the galactic plane ( djorgovski 1993 ) make it a typical halo object .",

    "[ bumps ] shows that the hb luminosity is too high for metal - rich clusters , and too low for metal - poor ones .",
    "conversely , in the second case the bump occurs at luminosities that are too low for the metal - rich clusters and too high for the metal - poor ones .",
    "the hb luminosity is mostly controlled , at fixed metallicity , by the helium content .",
    "higher @xmath29 means brighter hb luminosities .",
    "a different ( lower ) @xmath112 ratio would act in the right direction , lowering the hb luminosity at high @xmath101 values and enhancing it at low @xmath101 values .",
    "it should also be remembered that the luminosity of the rgb bump critically depends , at fixed metallicity , on the age . specifically , lower ages imply higher rgb stellar masses which in turn possess higher luminosities . as a consequence ,",
    "an interesting way of removing the cited offsets would be to assume that high - metallicity clusters are younger than low - metallicity ones . to quantify the required corrections , we computed values for the age differences at the extremes of the metallicity range covered by the models .",
    "we found that for [ fe / h ]  =  0.4 the clusters should have an age @xmath113  gyr lower and for [ fe / h ]  =  1.74 they should have an age @xmath114  gyr higher than the age of metal - intermediate clusters .",
    "the present comparison would therefore suggest an age - metallicity relation among globular clusters , with an age difference of @xmath115  gyr between metal - poor and metal - rich objects .",
    "however , we caution the reader that in any case the uncorrected relation is fairly compatible with the observations given the associated errors , and the quoted age difference could be considered as an upper limit . in summary , we argue that both @xmath97-enhanced chemical composition and envelope overshoot could actually exist in real gc stars . the former is observational evidence , but even considering this effect in theoretical models , the discrepancy seems to be not completely removed , thus some degree of overshoot must be invoked .",

    "in fact , comparing the 0.6  @xmath118 tracks for the two metallicities we verified that their differences in effective temperatures and luminosities are not dramatic .",
    "on the other hand , when applying the bolometric corrections , we find that the 0.06  dex difference in the zahb @xmath119 implies that the @xmath101=0.001 model starts @xmath120  @xmath9  mag brighter than the z=0.0004 model , while _ the absolute v magnitude of the post - hb `` plateau '' is roughly unchanged_. therefore , the reader should not give too much importance to the fact that in fig .",

    "[ supra_teo ] ) .",
    "it is also evident that the location of stars 4 and 5 is compatible with the 0.52  @xmath118 track , in the post - hb phase approaching the agb .",
    "furthermore , we notice that ( a ) the post - hb evolution of the 0.50  @xmath118 model is quite different from that of the 0.52  @xmath118 one , and ( b ) a decrement in mass as small as 0.03  @xmath118 between the two redder models increases their post - hb luminosity by @xmath122  mag .",

    "we therefore expect that , for decreasing masses , a brighter and brighter post - hb phase will be reached , until the star envelope is so much reduced that the agb can not be developed . from this point on , the resulting agb - manqu phase will attain lower and lower luminosities . on the basis of these arguments ,",
    "it is possible that a model with initial hb mass @xmath123 be able to develop the agb after passing a post - hb phase as luminous as the level of stars 6 and 7 .",
    "instead , stars 2 and 3 can be identified as objects in the pn phase either evolving from the classical post - agb or in the final agb - manqu phase .",

    "the presence of 1 star in this cmd area is in agreement with the field - star contamination previously evaluated .    a further test giving clues on the nature of the supra - hb stars , would be to compare the relative counts of hb and post - hb objects to those observed in globular clusters .",

    "<S> we derive a true distance modulus @xmath5 = 15.44 @xmath6 0.20 .    an accurate inspection of the cluster s bright and blue objects confirms the presence of seven `` supra - hb '' stars , six of which are identified as evolved descendants from hb progenitors .    </S>",
