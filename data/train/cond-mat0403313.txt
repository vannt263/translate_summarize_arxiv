    "over many decades the description of the physical properties of low - dimensional strongly correlated quantum systems has been one of the major tasks in theoretical condensed matter physics .",
    "generically , this task is complicated by the strong quantum fluctuations present in such systems which are usually modelled by minimal - model hubbard or heisenberg - style hamiltonians . despite the apparent simplicity of these hamiltonians , few analytically exact solutions are available and",
    "most analytical approximations remain uncontrolled .",
    "hence , numerical approaches have always been of particular interest , among them exact diagonalization and quantum monte carlo .",
    "decisive progress in the description of the low - energy equilibrium properties of one - dimensional strongly correlated quantum hamiltonians was achieved by the invention of the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) @xcite .",
    "it is concerned with the iterative decimation of the hilbert space of a growing quantum system such that some quantum state , say the ground state , is approximated in that restricted space with a maximum of overlap with the true state .",
    "let the quantum state of a one - dimensional system be @xmath0 where we consider a partition of the system into two blocks s and e , and where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are orthonormal bases of s and e respectively .",
    "then the dmrg decimation procedure consists of projecting @xmath3 on the hilbert spaces for s and e spanned by the @xmath4 eigenvectors @xmath5 and @xmath6 corresponding to the largest eigenvalues @xmath7 of the reduced density matrices @xmath8 such that @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "that both density matrices have the same eigenvalue spectrum is reflected in the guaranteed existence of the so - called schmidt decomposition of the wave function @xcite , @xmath11 where the number of positive @xmath12 is bounded by the dimension of the smaller of the bases of s and e.    recently @xcite , the ability of the dmrg decimation procedure to preserve the entanglement of @xmath3 between s and e has been studied in the context of quantum information science @xcite .",
    "this blooming field of research , bridging between quantum physics , computer science and information theory , offers a novel conceptual framework for the study of quantum many - body systems @xcite .",
    "new insights into old quantum many - body problems can be gained from the perspective of quantum information science , mainly through its eagerness to characterize quantum correlations . as an example ,",
    "a better understanding of the reasons of the breakdown of the dmrg in two - dimensional systems has been obtained in terms of the growth of bipartite entanglement in such systems @xcite .",
    "more specifically , in quantum information the entanglement of @xmath3 between s and e is quantified by the von neumann entropy of @xmath13 ( equivalently , of @xmath14 ) , @xmath15 a quantity that imposes a useful ( information theoretical ) bound @xmath16 on the minimal number @xmath4 of states to be kept during the dmrg decimation process if the truncated state is to be similar to @xmath3 . on the other hand , arguments from field theory imply that , at zero temperature , strongly correlated quantum systems are in some sense only slightly entangled in @xmath17 dimensions but significantly more entangled in @xmath18 dimensions : in particular , in @xmath17 a block corresponding to @xmath19 sites of a gapped infinite - length chain has an entropy @xmath20 that stays finite even in the thermodynamical limit @xmath21 , while at criticality @xmath20 only grows logarithmically with @xmath19 .",
    "it is this saturation or , at most , moderate growth of @xmath20 that ultimately accounts for the succeess of dmrg in @xmath17 . instead , in the general @xmath22-dimensional case the entropy of bipartite entanglement for a block of linear dimension @xmath19 scales as @xmath23 .",
    "thus , in @xmath24 dimensions the dmrg algorithm should keep a number @xmath4 of states that grows exponentially with @xmath19 , and the simulation becomes inefficient for large @xmath19 ( while still feasible for small @xmath19 ) .",
    "while dmrg has yielded an enormous wealth of information on the static and dynamic equilibrium properties of one - dimensional systems@xcite and is arguably the most powerful method in the field , only few attempts have been made so far to determine the time evolution of the states of such systems , notably in a seminal paper by cazalilla and marston @xcite .",
    "this question is of relevance in the context of the time - dependent hamiltonians realized e.g.  in cold atoms in optical lattices @xcite , in systems far from equilibrium in quantum transport , or in dissipative quantum mechanics .",
    "however , in another example of how quantum information science can contribute to the study of quantum many - body physics , one of us ( g.v . )",
    "has recently developed an algorithm for the simulation of slightly entangled quantum computations @xcite that can be used to simulate time evolutions of one - dimensional systems @xcite .",
    "this new algorithm , henceforth referred to as the time - evolving block decimation ( tebd ) algorithm , considers a small , dynamically updated subspace of the blocks s and e in eq .",
    "( [ eq : schmidt ] ) to efficiently represent the state of the system , as we will review in detail below .",
    "it was originally developed in order to show that a large amount of entanglement is necessary in quantum computations , the rationale there being quite simple : any _ quantum _ evolution ( e.g. a quantum computation ) involving only a `` sufficiently restricted '' amount of entanglement can be efficiently simulated in a _ classical _ computer using the tebd algorithm ; therefore , from an algorithmical point of view , any such quantum evolution is not more powerful than a classical computation .",
    "regardless of the implications for computer science , the above connection between the amount of entanglement and the complexity of simulating quantum systems is of obvious practical interest in condensed matter physics since , for instance , in @xmath17 dimensions the entanglement of most quantum systems happens to be `` sufficiently restricted '' precisely in the sense required for the tebd algorithm to yield an efficient simulation .",
    "in particular , the algorithm has already been implemented and tested successfully on spin chains@xcite , the bose - hubbard model and single - atom transistors@xcite and dissipative systems at finite temperature @xcite .",
    "a primary aim of this paper is to reexpress the tebd algorithm in a language more familiar to the dmrg community than the one originally used in refs .",
    "@xcite , which made substantial use of the quantum information parlance .",
    "this turns out to be a rewarding task since , as we show , the conceptual and formal similarities between the tebd and dmrg are extensive . both algorithms search for an approximation to the true wave function within a restricted class of wave functions , which can be identified as matrix product states @xcite , and had also been previously proposed under the name of finitely - correlated states@xcite .",
    "arguably , the big advantage of the tebd algorithm relies on its flexibility to flow in time through the submanifold of matrix product states .",
    "instead of considering time evolutions within some restricted subspace according to a fixed , projected , effective hamiltonian , the tebd algorithm updates a matrix product state in time using the bare hamiltonian directly .",
    "thus , in a sense , it is the schrdinger equation that decides , at each time step , which are the relevant eigenvectors for s and e in eq .",
    "( [ eq : schmidt ] ) , as opposed to having to select them from some relatively small , pre - selected subspace .",
    "a second goal of this paper is to show how the two algorithms can be integrated .",
    "the tebd algorithm can be improved by considering well - known dmrg techniques , such as the handling of good quantum numbers . but",
    "most importantly , we will describe how the tebd simulation algorithm can be incorporated into preexisting , quite widely used dmrg implementations , the so - called finite - system algorithm@xcite using white s prediction algorithm@xcite .",
    "the net result is an extremely powerful `` adaptive time - dependent dmrg '' algorithm , that we test and compare against previous proposals .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : oldtime ] , we discuss the problems currently encountered in applying dmrg to the calculation of explicitly time - dependent quantum states .",
    "section [ sec : matrixstates ] reviews the common language of matrix product states .",
    "we then express both the tebd simulation algorithm ( sec .   [ sec : vidal ] ) and dmrg ( sec .",
    "[ sec : dmrg ] ) in this language , revealing where both methods coincide , where they differ and how they can be combined . in section [ sec : newtime ] , we then formulate the modifications to introduce the tebd algorithm into standard dmrg to obtain the adaptive time - dependent dmrg , and section [ sec : bose ] discusses an example application , concerning the quantum phase transition between a superfluid and a mott - insulating state in a bose - hubbard model .",
    "to conclude , we discuss in section [ sec : conclusion ] the potential of the new dmrg variant .",
    "the first attempt to simulate the time evolution of quantum states using dmrg is due to cazalilla and marston @xcite . after applying a standard dmrg calculation using the hamiltonian @xmath25 to obtain the ground state of the system at @xmath26 , @xmath27 , the time - dependent schrdinger equation is numerically integrated forward in time , building an effective @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is taken as the hamiltonian approximating @xmath30 in the truncated hilbert space generated by dmrg .",
    "@xmath31 as an approximation to @xmath32 is built using the representations of operators in the block bases obtained in the standard dmrg calculation of the @xmath26 state .",
    "@xmath32 contains the changes in the hamiltonian with respect to the starting hamiltonian : @xmath33 .",
    "the ( effective ) time - dependent schrdinger equation reads @xmath34 { |\\psi(t)\\rangle } ,      \\label{eq : schroedinger}\\ ] ] where the time - dependence of the ground state resulting of @xmath30 has been transformed away .",
    "if the evolution of the ground state is looked for , the initial condition is obviously to take @xmath35 obtained by the preliminary dmrg run .",
    "forward integration can be carried out by step - size adaptive methods such as the runge - kutta integration based on the infinitesimal time evolution operator @xmath36 where we drop the subscript denoting that we are dealing with effective hamiltonians only .",
    "the algorithm used was a fourth - order adaptive size runge - kutta algorithm @xcite .",
    "sources of errors in this approach are twofold , due to the approximations involved in numerically carrying out the time evolution , and to the fact that all operators live on a truncated hilbert space .    for the systems studied we have obtained a conceptually simple improvement concerning the time evolution by replacing the explicitly non - unitary time - evolution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : nonunitaryevolution ] ) by the unitary crank - nicholson time evolution @xmath37    to implement the crank - nicholson time evolution efficiently we have used a ( non - hermitian ) biconjugate gradient method to calculate the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : unitaryevolution ] ) .",
    "in fact , this modification ensures higher precision of correlators , and the occurence of asymmetries with respect to reflection in the results decreased",
    ".    it should be noted , however , that for the crank - nicholson approach only lowest - order expansions of the time evolution operator @xmath38 have been taken ; we have not pursued feasible higher - order expansions .    as a testbed for time - dependent dmrg methods we use throughout this paper the time - dependent bose - hubbard hamiltonian , @xmath39 where the ( repulsive )",
    "onsite interaction @xmath40 is taken to be time - dependent .",
    "this model exhibits for commensurate filling a kosterlitz - thouless - like quantum phase transition from a superfluid phase for @xmath41 ( with @xmath42 ) to a mott - insulating phase for @xmath43 .",
    "we have studied a bose - hubbard model with @xmath44 and open boundary conditions , total particle number @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and instantaneous switching from @xmath47 in the superfluid phase to @xmath48 in the mott phase at @xmath26 .",
    "we consider the nearest - neighbor correlation , a robust numerical quantity , between sites 2 and 3 .",
    "up to 8 bosons per site ( i.e.   @xmath49 states per site ) were allowed to avoid cut - off effects in the bosonic occupation number in all calculations in this section . all times in this paper",
    "are measured in units of @xmath50 or @xmath51 , setting @xmath52 . comparing runge - kutta and crank - nicholson ( with time steps of @xmath53 ) we found the latter to be numerically preferable ; all static time - dependent dmrg calculations have been carried out using the latter approach .    however , hilbert space truncation is at the origin of more severe approximations .",
    "the key assumption underlying the approach of cazalilla and marston is that the effective static hilbert space created in the preliminary dmrg run is sufficiently large that @xmath54 can be well approximated within that hilbert space for all times , such that @xmath55 remains small as @xmath56 grows .",
    "this , in general , will only be true for relatively short times . a variety of modifications that should extend the reach of the static hilbert space in time can be imagined .",
    "they typically rest on the dmrg practice of `` targeting '' several states : to construct the reduced density matrix used to determine the relevant hilbert space states , one may carry out a partial trace over a mixture of a small number of states such that the truncated hilbert space is constructed so that all of those states are optimally approximated in the dmrg sense : @xmath57    a simple choice uses the targeting of @xmath58 , for @xmath59 less than 10 or so , approximating the short - time evolution , which we have found to substantially improve the quality of results for non - adiabatic switching of hamiltonian parameters in time : convergence in @xmath4 is faster and more consistent with the new dmrg method ( see below ) .",
    "similarly , we have found that for adiabatic changes of hamiltonian parameters results improve if one targets the ground states of both the initial and final hamiltonian .",
    "these approaches are conceptually very similar to targeting not only @xmath27 , but also @xmath60 and some @xmath61 , @xmath62 in lanczos vector dynamics dmrg@xcite , or real and imaginary part of @xmath63 in correction vector dynamics dmrg@xcite to calculate green s functions @xmath64    to illustrate the previous approaches , we show results for the parameters of the bose - hubbard model discussed above .",
    "time evolution is calculated in the crank - nicholson approach using a stepwidth @xmath65 in time units of @xmath50 targeting ( i ) just the superfluid ground state @xmath27 for @xmath47 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crank0 ] ) , ( ii ) in addition to ( i ) also the mott - insulating ground state @xmath66 for @xmath48 and @xmath67 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crank1 ] ) , ( iii ) in addition to ( i ) and ( ii ) also @xmath68 and @xmath69 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crank3 ] ) .",
    "we have used up to @xmath70 states to obtain converged results ( meaning that we could observe no difference between the results for @xmath71 and @xmath70 ) for @xmath72 , corresponding to roughly 25 oscillations .",
    "the results for the cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) are almost converged for @xmath73 , whereas ( i ) shows still crude deviations .",
    "a remarkable observation can be made if one compares the three @xmath70 curves ( fig .",
    "[ fig : crankcompn ] ) , which by standard dmrg procedure ( and for lack of a better criterion ) would be considered the final , converged outcome , both amongst each other or to the result of the new adaptive time - dependent dmrg algorithm which we are going to discuss below : result ( i ) is clearly _ not _ quantitatively correct beyond very short times , whereas result ( ii ) agrees very well with the new algorithm , and result ( iii ) agrees almost ( beside some small deviations at @xmath74 ) with result ( ii ) and the new algorithm .",
    "therefore we see that for case ( i ) the criterion of convergence in @xmath4 does not give a good control to determine if the obtained results are correct .",
    "this raises as well doubts about the reliability of this criterion for cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "a more elaborate , but also much more time - consuming improvement still within the framework of a static hilbert space was proposed by luo , xiang and wang @xcite .",
    "additional to the ground state they target a finite number of quantum states at various discrete times using a bootstrap procedure starting from the time evolution of smaller systems that are iteratively grown to the desired final size .",
    "the observation that even relatively robust numerical quantities such as nearest - neighbor correlations can be qualitatively and quantitatively improved by the additional targeting of states which merely share some fundamental characteristics with the true quantum state ( as we will never reach the mott - insulating ground state ) or characterize only the very short - term time evolution indicates that it would be highly desirable to have a modified dmrg algorithm which , for each time @xmath56 , selects hilbert spaces of dimension @xmath4 such that @xmath54 is represented optimally in the dmrg sense , thus attaining at _ all _ times the typical dmrg precision for @xmath4 retained states .",
    "the presentation of such an algorithm is the purpose of the following sections .",
    "as both the tebd simulation algorithm and dmrg can be neatly expressed in the language of matrix product states , let us briefly review the properties of these states also known as finitely - correlated states@xcite .",
    "we begin by considering a one - dimensional system of size @xmath75 , divided up into sites which each have a local hilbert space , @xmath76 . for simplicity",
    "we take the same dimension @xmath77 at all sites . in such a system",
    "a product state may be expressed as @xmath78 where @xmath79 denotes the local state on site @xmath80 .",
    "we can express a general state of the whole system as @xmath81 this general state exists in the hilbert space @xmath82 , with dimension @xmath83 .    a matrix product state is now formed by only using a specific set of expansion coefficients @xmath84 .",
    "let us construct this set in the following . to do this we define operators @xmath85 $ ] which correspond to a local basis state @xmath79 at site @xmath80 of the original system , but which act on auxiliary spaces of dimension @xmath4 , i.e. , @xmath86=\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta}a^i_{\\alpha\\beta}[\\sigma_i ] { |\\alpha\\rangle}{\\langle\\beta|},\\label{mpsdef } \\label{mpsadef}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 and @xmath88 are orthonormal basis states in auxiliary spaces . for visualization , we imagine the auxiliary state spaces to be located on the bonds next to site @xmath80 .",
    "if we label the bond linking sites @xmath80 and @xmath89 by @xmath80 , then we say that the states @xmath88 live on bond @xmath80 and the states @xmath87 on bond @xmath90 .",
    "the operators @xmath85 $ ] hence act as transfer operators past site @xmath80 depending on the local state on site @xmath80 . on the first and last site , which will need special attention later",
    ", this picture involves bonds @xmath91 and @xmath75 to the left of site 1 and to the right of site @xmath75 respectively . while these bonds have no physical meaning for open boundary conditions , they are identical and link sites 1 and @xmath75 as one physical bond for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "there is no a priori significance to be attached to the states in the auxiliary state spaces .    in general",
    ", operators corresponding to different sites can be different .",
    "if this is the case the resulting matrix product state to be introduced is referred to as a position dependent matrix product state .",
    "we also impose the condition @xmath92 \\hat{a}_i^\\dag[\\sigma_i]= \\mathcal{i},\\label{mpsident}\\ ] ] which we will see to be related to orthonormality properties of bases later .",
    "an unnormalized matrix product state in a form that will be found useful for hamiltonians with open boundary conditions is now defined as @xmath93 { |\\phi_r\\rangle } \\right ) { |{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$\\unboldmath}}\\rangle},\\label{mpscoef}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 and @xmath95 are the left and right boundary states in the auxiliary spaces on bonds 0 and @xmath75 .",
    "they act on the product of the operators @xmath96 to produce scalar coefficients @xmath97 { |\\phi_r\\rangle}\\ ] ] for the expansion of @xmath98 .",
    "several remarks are in order .",
    "it should be emphasized that the set of states obeying eq .",
    "( [ mpscoef ] ) is an ( arbitrarily constructed ) submanifold of the full boundary - condition independent hilbert space of the quantum many - body problem on @xmath75 sites that is hoped to yield good approximations to the true quantum states for hamiltonians with open boundary conditions .",
    "if the dimension @xmath4 of the auxiliary spaces is made sufficiently large then any general state of the system can , in principle , be represented exactly in this form ( provided that @xmath94 and @xmath95 are chosen appropriately ) , simply because the @xmath99 degrees of freedom to choose the expansion coefficients will exceed @xmath100 .",
    "this is , of course , purely academic .",
    "the practical relevance of the matrix product states even for computationally manageable values of @xmath4 is shown by the success of dmrg , which is known@xcite to produce matrix product states of auxiliary state space dimension @xmath4 , in determining energies and correlators at very high precision for moderate values of @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , some very important quantum states in one dimension , such as the valence - bond - solid ( vbs ) ground state of the affleck - kennedy - lieb - tasaki ( aklt ) model @xcite , can be described exactly by matrix product states using very small @xmath4 ( @xmath101 for the aklt model ) .",
    "let us now formulate a schmidt decomposition for matrix product states which can be done very easily .",
    "an unnormalized state @xmath98 of the matrix - product form of eq .",
    "( [ mpscoef ] ) with auxiliary space dimension @xmath4 can be written as @xmath102 where we have arbitrarily cut the chain into s on the left and e on the right with @xmath103 { |\\alpha\\rangle } \\right ]   { |{\\mbox{\\boldmath$\\sigma$\\unboldmath}}^s\\rangle } ,      \\label{eq : mpshalf}\\ ] ] and similarly @xmath104 , where @xmath105 are the states spanning the auxiliary state space on the cut bond .",
    "normalizing the states @xmath98 , @xmath106 and @xmath104 we obtain the representation @xmath107 where in @xmath12 the factors resulting from the normalization are absorbed .",

    "in this section we present some results of calculations on the bose - hubbard hamiltonian introduced in section [ sec : oldtime ] which have been carried out , using modest computational resources and an unoptimized code ( this concerns in particular the operations on complex matrices and vectors ) . in the following ,",
    "trotter time steps down to @xmath225 in units of @xmath50 were chosen .",
    "it is also important to note that in contrast to the dmrg calculations shown earlier for conventional time - dependent dmrg up to @xmath226 states per site were used as a local site basis for all calculations in this section .    comparing the results of the adaptive time - dependent dmrg for the bose - hubbard model with the parameters chosen as in section [ sec : oldtime ] with the static time - dependent dmrg we find that the convergence in @xmath4 is much faster , for the nearest neighbor correlations it sets in at about @xmath227 ( fig .",

    "[ fig : localconvml32 ] ) . in the @xmath228 system considered here , we encountered severe convergence problems using static time - dependent dmrg .",
    "by contrast , in the new approach convergence sets in for @xmath4 well below 100 , which is easily accessible numerically . let us remark that the number @xmath4 of states which have to be kept does certainly vary with the exact parameters chosen , depending if the state can be approximated well by matrix product states of a low dimension .",
    "at least in the case studied here , we found that this dependency is quite weak .",
    "we expect ( also from studying the time evolution of density matrix spectra ) that the model dependence of @xmath4 is roughly similar as in the static case .",
    "similar observations are made both for local occupancy ( a simpler quantity than nearest - neighbor correlations ) and longer - ranged correlations ( where we expect less precision ) .",
    "moving back to the parameter set of section [ sec : oldtime ] , we find as expected that the result for the local occupancy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : occupancy ] ) is converged for the same @xmath4 leading to convergence in the nearest - neighbor correlations .    in contrast , if we consider the correlation @xmath229 between sites further apart from each other the numerical results converge more slowly under an increase of @xmath4 than the almost local quantities .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : farcorr ] where the results for @xmath227 and @xmath73 still differ a bit for times larger than @xmath230 .",
    "the controlling feature of dmrg is the density matrix formed at each dmrg step  the decay of the density - matrix eigenvalue spectrum and the truncated weight ( i.e.  the sum of all eigenvalues whose eigenvectors are not retained in the block bases ) control its precision . in the discarded weight for the bose - hubbard model of section [ sec : oldtime ] shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : discweight ] , we can observe that the discarded weight shrinks drastically , going from @xmath231 to @xmath73 .",
    "this supports the idea that the system shows a fast convergence in @xmath4 .",
    "even more importantly , the discarded weight grows in time , as the state that was originally a ground state at @xmath232 decays into a superposition of many eigenstates of the system at @xmath233 .",
    "however , in particular for larger @xmath4 , it stays remarkably small throughout the simulation , indicating that adaptive time - dependent dmrg tracks the time - evolving state with high precision . moving to the detailed spectrum of the density matrix ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] for the left density matrix when the chain is symmetrically decomposed into s and e ) , the corresponding distribution of the eigenvalues can be seen to be approximately exponential . in agreement with the increasing truncation error",
    ", one also observes that the decay becomes less steep as time grows .",
    "yet , we still find a comparatively fast decay of the eigenvalue spectrum at all times , necessary to ensure the applicability of tebd and adaptive time - dependent dmrg respectively .",
    "note for all results shown that the unusually large number of states per site ( @xmath226 ) which would not occur in hubbard or heisenberg models could there be translated directly into longer chains or larger state spaces ( larger @xmath4 ) for the same computational effort , given that the algorithm is @xmath224 . in that sense , we have been discussing an algorithmically hard case , but in fermionic models dmrg experience tells us that @xmath4 has to be taken much larger in fermionic systems . for the fermionic hubbard model , with @xmath234 , more than @xmath235 is feasible with the unoptimized code , and much higher",
    "@xmath4 values would be possible if optimizations were carried out .",
    "this should be enough to have quantitatively reliable time - evolutions for fermionic chains , while of course not reaching the extreme precision one is used to in dmrg for the static case .",
    "as the algorithmic cost is dominated by @xmath236 , the product @xmath237 is an important quantity to look at : while current tebd implementations range at 100 or less , adaptive time - dependent dmrg using good quantum numbers runs at the order of 1000 ( and more ) .",
    "let us conclude this section by pointing out that at least one improvement can be incorporated almost trivially into this most simple version of adaptive time - dependent dmrg .",
    "since we have used a first - order trotter decomposition , we expect that for fixed @xmath4 results of measurements at a fixed time converge linearly with respect to the time step @xmath238 chosen , as the error per time step scales as @xmath239 , but the number of time steps needed to reach the fixed time grows as @xmath240 .",
    "in other words , the trotter error is inversely proportional to the calculation time spent .",
    "this can indeed be observed in results such as presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsconv ] .",
    "it is very easily and at hardly any algorithmic cost that a second order trotter decomposition can be implemented , leading to errors of order @xmath239 . the second order trotter decomposition reads@xcite @xmath241 where we have grouped all local hamiltonians on odd and even bonds into @xmath242 and @xmath243 respectively .",
    "at first sight this seems to indicate that at each trotter time step three ( instead of two ) moves ( `` zips '' ) through the chain have to be carried out .",
    "however , in many applications at the end of most time steps , the hamiltonian does not change , such that for almost all time steps , we can contract the second @xmath244 from the previous and the first @xmath244 from the current time step to a standard @xmath245 time step .",
    "hence , we incur almost no algorithmic cost .",
    "this is also standard practice in quantum monte carlo @xcite ; following qmc , second order trotter evolution is set up as follows :    1 .",
    "start with a half - time step @xmath244 .",
    "2 .   carry out successive time steps @xmath246 and @xmath247 .",
    "3 .   at measuring times ,",
    "measure expectation values after a @xmath247 time step , and again after a time step @xmath248 , and form the average of the two values as the outcome of the measurement .",
    "4 .   at times when the hamiltonian changes , do not contract two half - time steps into one time step .    in this way ,",
    "additional algorithmic cost is only incurred at the ( in many applications rare ) times when the hamiltonian changes while strongly reducing the trotter decomposition error",
    ". even more precise , but now at an algorithmic cost of factor 5 over the first or second - order decompositions , would be the usage of fourth - order trotter decompositions ( leading to 15 zips through the chain per time step , of which 5 , however , can typically be eliminated)@xcite .",
    "the tebd algorithm for the simulation of slightly entangled quantum systems , such as quantum spin chains and other one - dimensional quantum systems , was originally developed in order to establish a link between the computational potential of quantum systems and their degree of entanglement , and serves therefore as a good example of how concepts and tools from quantum information science can influence other areas of research , in this case quantum many - body physics .    while exporting ideas from one field of knowledge to another may appear as an exciting and often fruitful enterprise",
    ", differences in language and background between researchers in so far separated fields can also often become a serious obstacle to the proper propagation and full assimilation of such ideas . in this paper",
    "we have translated the tebd algorithm into the language of matrix product states .",
    "this language is a natural choice to express the dmrg algorithm  which , for over a decade , has dominated the simulation of one - dimensional quantum many - body systems . in this way , we have made the tebd algorithm fully accessible to the dmrg community .",
    "on the other hand , this translation has made evident that the tebd and the dmrg algorithms have a number of common features , a fact that can be exploited .",
    "we have demonstrated that a very straightforward modification of existing finite - system dmrg codes to incorporate the tebd leads to a new adaptive time - dependent dmrg algorithm . even without attempting to reach the computationally most efficient incorporation of the tebd algorithm into dmrg implementations",
    ", the resulting code seems to perform systematically better than static time - dependent dmrg codes at very reasonable numerical cost , converging for much smaller state spaces , as they change in time to track the actual state of the system . on the other hand , while it presents no new conceptual idea , the new code is also significantly more efficient than existing embodiments of the tebd , for instance thanks to the way dmrg handles good quantum numbers .",
    "while we have considered bosons as an example , as in standard dmrg fermionic and spin systems present no additional difficulties .",
    "various simple further improvements are feasible , and we think that adaptive time - dependent dmrg can be applied not only to problems with explicitly time - dependent hamiltonians , but also to problems where the quantum state changes strongly in time , such as in systems where the initial quantum state is far from equilibrium .",
    "the method should thus also be of great use in the fields of transport and driven dissipative quantum systems .",

    "<S> we translate the tebd algorithm into the language of matrix product states in order to both highlight and exploit its resemblances to the widely used density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) algorithms . the tebd algorithm , being based on updating a matrix product state in time , </S>",
    "<S> is very accessible to the dmrg community and it can be enhanced by using well - known dmrg techniques , for instance in the event of good quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly , we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing dmrg implementations to produce a remarkably effective and versatile `` adaptive time - dependent dmrg '' variant , that we also test and compare to previous proposals . </S>"
