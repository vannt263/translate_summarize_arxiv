    "in string theory , it had been thought that standard concepts of space - time would break down at the scale @xmath3 since it is the scale of probes , i.e. fundamental strings . in @xcite , however , it was argued that the structure of space - time on sub - stringy scales can be probed by d - branes .",
    "space - time appearing in the d - brane approach has very different features from that probed by fundamental strings .",
    "first of all , space - time coordinates are promoted to non - commuting matrices , and usual space - time emerges from moduli space of d - brane world - volume gauge theory .",
    "so it is interesting to investigate space - time by using d - branes as probes and compare it with space - time probed by fundamental strings .",
    "investigations toward this direction were made in @xcite , in which d - branes on orbifolds were studied . in particular , three dimensional orbifolds in @xcite serve as local descriptions of singularities in calabi - yau manifolds .",
    "investigations on the moduli space of calabi - yau manifolds were made in @xcite based on fundamental strings .",
    "it was shown that the moduli space has a rich phase structure .",
    "it includes topologically distinct calabi - yau spaces and non - geometric phases such as orbifold and landau - ginzburg phases .",
    "topologically distinct calabi - yau phases are connected by flops .",
    "a flop is achieved by a sequence of operations : first blowing down some homologically nontrivial cycle @xmath4 and then blowing up another @xmath4 . in this process , hodge numbers do not change but more subtle topological indices such as intersection numbers among homology cycles change .",
    "in the course of the flop , the space becomes singular due to the shrinking of some @xmath4 . as a conformal field theory",
    ", however , this process occurs smoothly .",
    "possibility of the smooth topology change is demonstrated by using mirror symmetry in @xcite . in the gauged linear sigma model approach@xcite ,",
    "the singularity is avoided by giving non - zero theta angle . as for the non - geometric phases ,",
    "it is argued that they can also be interpreted geometrically by analytic continuation to calabi - yau phases , although part of the calabi - yau manifold has been shrunk to string or sub - stringy scales @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "the moduli space of calabi - yau manifolds was investigated by using d - branes as probes .",
    "they considered d - branes in typeii string theory on orbifolds @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "it gives @xmath7 gauge theory with fayet - iliopoulos d - terms coming from twisted sectors of closed strings . as the coefficients of the fayet - iliopoulos d - terms change , the moduli space of the gauge theory changes .",
    "a priori , it may seem that a rich phase structure arises as in @xcite .",
    "however it is shown that only calabi - yau phases are allowed and non - geometric phases are projected out .",
    "this result matches the analytically continued picture of the moduli space in @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the study of the moduli space of calabi - yau compactifications in m theory@xcite , which can be thought of as strong coupling limit of type iia theory .    to proceed the comparison between the moduli space of calabi - yau spaces probed by fundamental strings and that probed by d - branes , it is important to investigate topology changing process in the d - brane approach . in this paper",
    "we present an explicit example in which the moduli space includes topologically distinct calabi - yau phases connected by flops based on d - brane world - volume gauge theory .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in section 2 , we review flops in terms of toric geometry and gauged linear sigma models which are necessary to the analyses in the following sections . in section 3 , we explain d - branes on orbifold @xmath0 . in section 4 ,",
    "we first review the work @xcite , which treats @xmath8 cases .",
    "we then consider @xmath2 cases and explicitly check that non - geometric phases are projected out . in the @xmath1 case , we present the model in which there are five topologically distinct phases connected by flops . in section 5 , we consider d - brane on orbifolds with non - isolated singularities .",
    "section 6 contains discussion .",
    "in this section , we review toric varieties and physical realization of toric varieties in terms of gauged linear sigma models emphasizing topology changing process . for details , see @xcite .    a complex @xmath9-dimensional toric variety is a space which contains algebraic torus @xmath10 as a dense open subset .",
    "a toric variety is determined by a combinatorial data @xmath11 called a fan , so we denote it by @xmath12 .",
    "a fan @xmath11 is a collection of strongly convex rational polyhedral cones in @xmath13 with apex at the origin . to be a fan it must have the property that ( 1 ) any two members of the collection intersect in a common face , ( 2 ) for each member of @xmath11 all its face are also in @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 can be expressed in the form @xmath14 , where @xmath15 , @xmath16 and the action of @xmath17 on @xmath18 are determined by @xmath11 as follows .",
    "let @xmath19 be the integral generators of the one dimensional cones in @xmath11 . then associate a homogeneous coordinate @xmath20 of @xmath18 with each vector @xmath21 .",
    "define @xmath16 , a subset of @xmath18 , by @xmath22 here @xmath23 means that @xmath24 is a cone in @xmath11 , and @xmath25 means that @xmath21 is a generator of some one - dimensional cone in @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath15 vectors @xmath19 in @xmath13 satisfy @xmath26 relations @xmath27 with @xmath28 .",
    "then the action of @xmath17 on @xmath20 is defined as @xmath29    an important point is that a set of vectors @xmath30 determines the action of @xmath17 on @xmath18 , but does not determine @xmath16 . to determine @xmath16",
    "we must specify which vectors generate each cone @xmath24 in @xmath11 .",
    "the specification is called a triangulation of @xmath11 . in general",
    "there are various triangulations for the same set of vectors @xmath30 .",
    "different triangulations correspond to different @xmath16 and hence different toric varieties @xmath12 .",
    "various properties of a toric variety @xmath12 can be expressed in terms of its fan @xmath11 .",
    "for example , @xmath12 is compact if and only if @xmath11 spans the whole of @xmath13 .",
    "what we want to investigate is geometry in the neighborhood of singularities in calabi - yau manifolds , so we consider cases where @xmath12 has zero chern class . for these cases a fan @xmath11 must have the following property , @xmath31 for a certain vector @xmath32 .",
    "this condition leads to relations among @xmath17 charges , @xmath33 due to ( [ eq : q - n ] ) .",
    "( [ eq : c_1 ] ) also implies that all the points specified by vectors @xmath34 lie in a certain hyperplane @xmath35 .",
    "thus we can represent a fan @xmath11 in terms of the intersection of @xmath11 with the hyperplane @xmath35 .",
    "we call it as a toric diagram .    in the following we consider cases that the fan @xmath11 is simplicial , for which @xmath12 has at most quotient singularities .",
    "simplicial fan is such that each cone @xmath24 can be written in the form @xmath36 for some linearly independent vectors @xmath37 .",
    "when @xmath38 , we define a volume for simplicial cones to be @xmath39 times the volume of the polyhedron with vertices @xmath40 . here",
    "we take @xmath21 to be the first nonzero lattice point on the ray @xmath41 . )",
    ", the volume of a cone can be represented by `` area '' of intersection of the cone with the hyperplane @xmath35 .",
    "unit of the area is defined as the area of the intersection between @xmath35 and a cone with unit volume .",
    "] @xmath12 is smooth if every @xmath9-dimensional cone in the fan has volume one .",
    "if some cones have volume greater than one , @xmath12 has quotient singularities .",
    "however we can obtain a smooth toric variety by subdividing the cone until each cone has volume one .",
    "this procedure corresponds to a blow up of the singularity .",
    "an important point is that the resolution of the singularity is not necessarily unique .",
    "there are often numerous ways of subdividing the cones in @xmath11 .",
    "thus there are numerous smooth varieties that can arise from different ways of resolving the singularity . in general",
    "these varieties are topologically distinct . for calabi - yau threefold such topologically distinct varieties",
    "can be connected by flops .",
    "a flop is a transformation of a manifold into a topologically different manifold which replaces some homologically nontrivial cycle @xmath4 with another @xmath4 . in toric language ,",
    "a flop is described by toric diagrams which include figure [ fig : toricflop ] .",
    "we denote toric varieties corresponding figure [ fig : toricflop](a ) and [ fig : toricflop](b ) as @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "the toric variety @xmath42 is written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 charge of @xmath20 are @xmath47 due to the relation @xmath48 .",
    "the toric variety @xmath43 is @xmath49 where @xmath50 and @xmath46 charge is the same as that for @xmath51 .    to see the difference between the two manifolds , we define subsets of @xmath52 as @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "then the toric varieties are written as @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 is common to both manifolds .",
    "different contributions come from @xmath58 and @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath59 is a @xmath4 , which we call @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is another @xmath4 , which we call @xmath62 .",
    "topology change occurs by the replacement of @xmath60 by @xmath62 .",
    "the quotient construction of a toric variety can be physically realized as a classical vacuum of @xmath63 supersymmetric two dimensional gauged linear sigma model@xcite . in this approach , @xmath20 is the lowest component of a chiral superfield with @xmath64 charge @xmath65 . the quotient by @xmath66 may be viewed to having taken place in two stages .",
    "first we fix the @xmath67 degree of freedom by imposing d - flatness condition and then divide by @xmath64 gauge symmetry .",
    "the most important point is that inclusion of fayet - iliopoulos d - term with coefficient @xmath68 provides the degrees of freedom which are the counterparts to the possible triangulations of @xmath11 .    in the gauged linear sigma model description ,",
    "a flop is described by a model with the following d - flatness condition @xmath69 the @xmath64 action on four chiral superfields is @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 . for @xmath74 , the vacuum moduli space specified by the d - flatness condition",
    "do not contain @xmath75 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to removing the point set @xmath76 in toric description . for @xmath77 ,",
    "the vacuum moduli space do not contain @xmath78 .",
    "this condition is equivalent to removing the point set @xmath79 . for both cases @xmath80 controls the size of @xmath4 associated with the blow up .",
    "the flop occurs in passing from @xmath74 to @xmath77 and vice versa .",
    "thus the sign of the fayet - iliopoulos parameter specifies the triangulation as noted above .",
    "classically there is a singularity at @xmath81 , but as long as theta angle is generic , smooth topology change can occur @xcite .",
    "we consider a typeii string theory on an orbifold @xmath0 , with @xmath82 a subgroup of @xmath83 . we begin with several remarks on orbifolds itself .",
    "we take complex coordinates for @xmath84 as @xmath85 @xmath86 , and an action of a generator @xmath87 of @xmath82 on @xmath85 as @xmath88 where @xmath89 are integers which satisfy @xmath90 , mod @xmath91 . here",
    "we consider cases @xmath92 since an orbifold with @xmath93 for some @xmath94 is a direct product of @xmath95 and @xmath96 . thus orbifolds are labeled by @xmath91 and @xmath97 , but",
    "different @xmath98 s often give the same orbifold .",
    "that is , if there is some integer @xmath15 which has no common factor with @xmath91 except one and satisfies the equation @xmath99 the orbifold with @xmath97 is the same as the orbifold with @xmath100 .",
    "this is because the two cases give the same action of @xmath82 on @xmath85 if we take all elements @xmath101 , ( @xmath102 ) into account .",
    "it includes a trivial case @xmath103 @xmath104 .",
    "apart from this , an exchange between @xmath105 and @xmath106 does not change the geometry since it is merely an exchange between @xmath85 and @xmath107 .",
    "we present explicit examples of the equivalence in the following sections .",
    "to describe d - branes on the orbifold @xmath0 , we first consider @xmath91 d - branes on @xmath84 .",
    "it gives four dimensional @xmath108 supersymmetric @xmath109 gauge theory .",
    "bosonic field contents of the theory are a gauge field @xmath110 , ( @xmath111 ) , and three complex scalar fields @xmath85 , ( @xmath112 ) where @xmath113 .",
    "we then impose invariance under @xmath82 .",
    "it acts on the space - time indices of @xmath84 as ( [ eq : orbifold ] ) , supersymmetry due to the relation @xmath90 , mod @xmath91 . ] and on chan - paton indices ( which label the d - branes ) in the regular representation @xmath114 .",
    "thus the generator @xmath87 of @xmath82 acts on the gauge field as @xmath115 invariance under @xmath82 gives @xmath116 , where @xmath117 , therefore the gauge group @xmath109 is reduced to @xmath7 .    for @xmath85 , @xmath82 acts as @xmath118 invariance under @xmath82 gives @xmath119 which leave @xmath120 fields .",
    "we denote these fields as @xmath121 since all fields have charge zero for diagonal @xmath64 , nontrivial gauge symmetry is @xmath122 .    the field contents can be described by quiver diagrams@xcite .",
    "it consists of @xmath91 vertices associated with gauge fields @xmath123 and @xmath120 oriented links associated with @xmath124 .",
    "the links represent the information on @xmath7 charges of @xmath124 .",
    "the equivalence ( [ eq : equivalence ] ) except @xmath125 corresponds to a certain exchange among vertices .    to obtain vacuum moduli space of the theory , we first impose f - flatness conditions .",
    "f - flatness conditions give @xmath126 equations @xmath127 so the resulting space is ( n+2)-dimensional , which we denote as @xmath128 .",
    "then we impose d - flatness conditions and divide by the gauge symmetry .",
    "d - flatness conditions give ( real ) @xmath129 equations @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 is a coefficient of fayet - iliopoulos d - term , which comes from the twisted sector of closed strings .",
    "together with a gauge fixing of @xmath122 symmetry , we have three dimensional space as expected .",
    "this is the vacuum moduli space of the d - brane world - volume gauge theory .",
    "we denote it by @xmath133 .    note that although f - flatness condition leads to @xmath134=0 $ ] , @xmath135 $ ] does not vanish if @xmath136 . thus the vacuum moduli space is embedded nontrivially into a larger non - commuting configuration space .",
    "we express the geometry of the moduli space by using toric method as follows .",

    "first , we introduce @xmath120 variables @xmath139 and @xmath137 variables @xmath140 as @xmath141 , @xmath142 .",
    "then the solution of the f - flatness conditions is written in the form @xmath143 where @xmath144 .",

    "the charge matrix is given by @xmath264 it determines eight vectors which generate one dimensional cones in @xmath181 , @xmath265 figure [ fig : z11b ] represents these eight vectors .    for the choice of redundant variables fayet - iliopoulos parameters must satisfy @xmath266 under these conditions , fayet - iliopoulos parameters of the resulting @xmath267 gauged linear sigma model satisfy the following inequalities @xmath268    however these conditions are not enough to determine the phase . to see this",
    "we explicitly write down the d - flatness conditions .",
    "@xmath269 if @xmath270 can have both positive and negative value , topology change occurs as the sign of @xmath270 changes .",
    "in fact , we can see that it occurs as follows . under the conditions ( [ eq : zeta11b ] )",
    ", @xmath270 s must satisfy @xmath271 these inequalities restrict possible sign of @xmath270 and the following five cases , which we call ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) , are allowed .",
    "@xmath272 we can see that the triangulation of the toric diagram is uniquely determined for each case .",
    "the corresponding toric diagrams are depicted in figure [ fig : z11bflop ] .",
    "each triangulation consists of eleven cones with volume one , thus it represents a phase of completely resolved manifolds with definite topology .",
    "the phases ( a ) and ( b ) are connected by a flop with respect to the parallelogram with vertices @xmath273 , @xmath274 , @xmath275 and @xmath276 , and the flop is accomplished by the change of the sign of @xmath277 .",
    "similarly the phases ( a ) and ( c ) , ( a ) and ( d ) , ( c ) and ( e ) are connected by a flop controlled by @xmath278 , @xmath279 , @xmath280 , respectively .",
    "we can see that there is no triangulation except these five cases which completely resolves the orbifold singularity .",
    "orbifolds often have non - isolated singularities as in the @xmath281 , @xmath236 case . consider an orbifold @xmath0 with @xmath97 .",
    "if @xmath91 and @xmath105 have a common factor except one , the orbifold has a non - isolated fixed point of @xmath82 and hence has a non - isolated singularity .",
    "thus there are models with non - isolated singularity if @xmath91 is not a prime number .",
    "especially orbifold singularities are always non - isolated if @xmath91 is even",
    ". the analyses in the previous sections can be almost straightforwardly applicable to these cases .",
    "we have explicitly calculated the moduli space of d - branes on such orbifolds for @xmath282 cases , case , @xmath105 must be zero ( mod 2 ) for some @xmath94 , so the orbifold is a direct product of @xmath283 and @xmath96 . ] and @xmath281 , @xmath236 case and verified that only the geometric phases are realized .",
    "topologically distinct phases emerge in the @xmath284 , @xmath285 case , in which there are five phases connected by flops ( figure [ fig : z6bflop ] ) .",
    "we have also found that the moduli space consists of six blown - up phases connected by flops in the @xmath281 , @xmath236 case .",
    "we can see that for both cases there is no other triangulation which completely resolves the orbifold singularity .",
    "we also note that toric diagrams corresponding to non - isolated cases always have vertices on its codimension one boundary .",
    "from the analyses we have made in this paper , it seems that there is a correspondence between the classification of models on @xmath0 by @xmath98 and the classification of triangles with area @xmath91 ( as noted in subsection 4.3 ) , and what phases are allowed for each model is determined according to the method of subdivisions of the triangle with area @xmath91 into @xmath91 triangles with area one .",
    "( here vertices of each triangle lie on the lattice @xmath226 . )",
    "it means that only completely blown - up phases are realized as pointed out in @xcite , and topology change can occur if the triangle with area @xmath91 includes parallelogram with respect to the lattice @xmath226 ."
