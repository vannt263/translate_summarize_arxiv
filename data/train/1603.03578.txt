    "recently , the generation and transmission of spin current in afms have attracted great attention .",
    "the spin pumping studies on ( pt , ta)/(nio , coo)/y@xmath2fe@xmath3o@xmath4 ( yig ) heterostructures demonstrate that the spin current generated in yig layer can pass through the antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator nio or coo layer and can be detected in pt or ta layer by inverse spin - hall effect ( ishe ) .",
    "@xcite similar results were also revealed in ( pt , ta)/irmn / cofeb or pt / nio / feni heterostructures by spin - torque ferromagnetic resonance ( st - fmr ) technique , where the spin current generated by spin - hall effect ( she ) in pt or ta layer can propagate through irmn or nio layer and change the fmr linewidth .",
    "@xcite the spin current generated by spin pumping or spin seebeck was also observed in irmn / yig , cr / yig , and @xmath5mn / py ( @xmath5 = fe , pd , ir , and pt ) bilayers through ishe .",
    "@xcite moreover , the irmn / yig , pt / cr@xmath6o@xmath2 , and pt / mnf@xmath6 exhibit spin - hall magnetoresistance ( smr ) and large ishe voltage , respectively , implying that the afms can be both spin - current detector and generator .  @xcite these investigations open up new opportunities in developing the afms - based spin - current devices .",
    "the irmn alloy , which have been widely used to pin an adjacent fm layer in spin valve devices via exchange bias ,  @xcite demonstrates large ishe voltage when in contacts with yig .",
    "@xcite recently , a large she and anomalous - hall effect ( ahe ) have been theoretically proposed in cr , femn , and irmn afms owing to their large spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) or berry phase of the non - collinear spin textures .",
    "@xcite these theoretical predictions were also found to be valid for other cubic non - collinear afms , e.g. , snmn@xmath2 and gemn@xmath2 , where the calculations have been repeated with comparable results .",
    "@xcite the experimental investigation of ahe and she on the afms could be helpful from both fundamental and practical viewpoints for afms spintronics .",
    "as previously revealed in cr / yig bilayers , the large anomalous - hall resistance ( ahr ) in thin unprotected cr film is likely caused by the surface fm cr oxides .",
    "@xcite similar situation is expected in unprotected irmn / yig bilayers .",
    "since the pt / yig bilayer is well studied ,  @xcite in this study , we choose the pt as cap layer to protect the irmn from oxidation to investigate the ahe and she of irmn by measuring the spin transport properties in pt / irmn / yig heterostructures .",

    "@xcite the magnetized pt shares some common features as magnetic yig film , i.e. , strong anisotropy .",

    "2(g ) . in the studied temperature range ,",
    "as increasing the @xmath29 , the @xmath24 also increases and reaches a maximum around @xmath29 = 3 nm , which excludes the interfacial origin of the observed ahr .",
    "the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) for pt / irmn / yig was also measured down to low temperatures . as an example , the amr of pt / irmn(1)/yig and pt / yig for three different field scans are presented in top panel of fig .",
    "3 . when the magnetic field scans within the @xmath30 plane [ fig .",
    "3(a)(d ) ] , both the camr and smr contribute to the total amr ; for the @xmath15 plane [ fig .",
    "3(b)(e ) ] , the resistance changes are attributed to the mpe - induced camr ; for the @xmath16 plane [ fig .",
    "3(c)(f ) ] , the camr is zero , and only the smr are expected .",
    "@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the @xmath18 scan shows negligible amr and the resistance is almost independent of @xmath18 , indicating the extremely weak mpe at the interface even down to low temperatures .",
    "however , the mpe is significant at pt / yig interface [ see fig .",
    "3(e ) ] : the maximum amplitude of camr is around 2.2 @xmath9 10@xmath31 , which is comparable to the smr . thus , the irmn can be used as clean spin current detector and generator , similar to the normal rh or afm cr metals .",
    "@xcite since the camr is negligible in pt / irmn(1)/yig , the smr dominates the amr when the magnetic field is varied within the @xmath30 plane , the amplitudes of @xmath17 scan are almost identical to @xmath19 scan . while for pt / yig , due to the mpe - induced camr , none of the amplitudes is identical to each other .",
    "the temperature dependence of the amr amplitudes for all @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 scans are summarized in fig .",
    "3(g ) and fig .",
    "3(h ) for pt / irmn(1)/yig and pt / yig , respectively .",
    "upon decreasing the temperature , the smr persists down to 10 k , with the amplitudes monotonically decreasing from 7.5 @xmath9 10@xmath32 ( 300 k ) to 3.0 @xmath9 10@xmath32 ( 10 k ) in pt / irmn(1)/yig . for pt / irmn / yig , the amplitudes of smr are almost an order smaller than that of the pt / yig due to the smaller spin - hall angle , shorter spin diffusion length , and larger electrical resistivity of irmn .",
    "@xcite the temperature characteristics of smr amplitudes in pt / irmn / yig are significantly different from the pt / yig or pd / yig bilayers , where the smr amplitudes exhibit nonmonotonic temperature dependence and acquire a maximum around 100 k.  @xcite for pt / yig , the temperature dependence of smr amplitude can be described by a single spin - relaxation mechanism .",
    "@xcite the spin diffusion length is defined as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are diffusion constant and spin - flip relaxation time , respectively . within the elliot - yafet spin - orbit scattering model ,",
    "both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are proportional to the reciprocal of temperature dependence of the resistivity 1/@xmath36 .",
    "@xcite in pt metal , the electrical resistivity mainly comes from phonon - electron scattering at high temperature , then @xmath37 .",
    "however , the extra magnetic electron scattering need to be considered in pt / irmn / yig heterostructures , the assumption of @xmath37 is invalid .",
    "it is noted that the heterostructures with different irmn thicknesses exhibit similar temperature dependent characteristics with different numerical values compared to the pt / irmn(1)/yig heterostructure shown here .",
    "for example , the pt / irmn(3)/yig exhibits the smr amplitude of 6.8 @xmath9 10@xmath32 at room temperature .",
    "the sizable smr observed in pt / irmn / yig heterostructures indicates that the spin current can transport through irmn layer .",

    "as an example , the normalized magnetic hysteresis loops @xmath42/@xmath38 for pt / irmn(1)/yig at various temperatures after field cooling from 300 k are presented in fig .",
    "4(a ) . the derived exchange bias field @xmath39 versus temperature",
    "are summarized in fig .",
    "4(b ) , from which the @xmath40 are approximately estimated to be 150 k , 180 k , and 220 k for 1 nm , 3 nm and 5 nm irmn , respectively , as the arrow indicated .",
    "similar blocking temperatures were previously reported in irmn / mgo / ta tunnel junctions and irmn / nife bilayer .",
    "@xcite moreover , the coercivity @xmath41 also exhibits a step - like increase near the blocking temperature , as the arrow shown in the inset of fig .",
    "4(b ) , indicating the strongly enhanced exchange coupling between irmn and yig layer below @xmath40 .      based on the above experimental results , we discuss the origins of the significant ahr in pt / irmn / yig heterostructures and the effect of afm order on spin transport properties .",
    "there are at least four contributions to the observed ahr in pt / irmn / yig : mpe , spin - hall based smr , spin - dependent interface scattering , and intrinsic properties of irmn metal .",
    "in contrast to the pt / yig , the negligible camr in pt / irmn / yig indicates the extremely weak mpe at pt / irmn or irmn / yig interfaces , which is different from the previous studied of irmn / yig bilayer .",
    "@xcite the smr model based on she also predicts an anomalous - hall - like resistance ,  @xcite whose magnitude and sign are determined by the spin diffusion length and spin - hall angle of the metal and the imaginary part of the spin mixing conductance , respectively . though the thickness dependence of the ahr in pt / irmn / yig can be described by the smr model , it fails to explain the ahr by the following reasons : ( i ) an arbitrary temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the spin mixing conductance parameter is required to qualitatively describe the temperature - dependent ahr data , i.e. , sign reversal ; ( ii ) according to the spin pumping studies , both the spin - hall angle and the spin diffusion length of irmn are smaller than pt , which can not explain the enhancement of ahr by increasing the irmn thickness .",
    "@xcite spin - dependent scattering at the interface , combined with the conventional skew - scattering and side - jump mechanisms , can also give rise to ahr .",
    "@xcite again , the enhancement of ahr by increasing the irmn thickness excludes the interfacial origin .",
    "finally , the theoretical calculations predict a large ahe and she in irmn metal not only attributed to the large soc of heavy ir atoms which is transferred to the magnetic mn atoms by hybridization effect but also the berry phase of the non - collinear spin structures .",
    "@xcite we conclude that the large ahr observed in pt / irmn / yig is likely associated with soc and non - collinear magnetic structure of irmn . however , the non - trivial temperature dependence of ahr demands further theoretical and experimental investigations .",
    "now we discuss the possible interplay between afm order and spin transport properties . as shown in fig . 2 and fig .",
    "3 , there is no clear anomalous in ahr or smr near the blocking temperatures of irmn , implying weak correlations between the ahe or she and the afm order in irmn .",
    "similar results were also observed in cr / yig bilayers , where the ishe voltage and ahr is also independent of afm ordering temperature .",
    "@xcite according to our magnetization results ( fig .",
    "4 ) , the afm ordering temperatures of our irmn films are well below room temperature . however , the enhancement of ahr in pt / irmn / yig happens in the whole studied temperature range [ see fig .",
    "there are two possible reasons for this phenomenon , one is that the ahe and she attributed to non - collinear magnetism is generated on a length scale of nanometer and is a local property not relying on long range magnetic order , i.e. , regardless of how irmn grains are orientated , as reported previously in mn@xmath3si@xmath2 film .",
    "@xcite the second one is that the strength of soc is independent of afm order in irmn metal , which is mainly determined by the ir atoms .",
    "in summary , we report an investigation of ahe and she by measuring the ahr and smr in pt / irmn / yig heterostrucutres .",
    "the significant ahr in pt / irmn / yig is likely associated with the strong soc and non - collinear magnetic structure of irmn , and the sizable smr indicates that the spin current can transport through irmn .",
    "the observed non - trivial temperature dependence of ahr can not be consistently explained by the existing theories , further investigations are needed to clarify this issue . moreover , both the ahr and smr are uncoupled to the afm order of irmn metal .",
    "the negligible mpe at pt / irmn or irmn / yig interface and large ishe indicate that irmn can be another model system to explore physics and devices associated with antiferromagnetism and pure spin current .",
