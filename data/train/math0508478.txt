    "@xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath0 is a relatively minimal rational surface having exceptional section with square @xmath10 . here a k3 surface with non - symplectic involution appears as the double coverings of @xmath0 ramified in @xmath11 with the involution of the double covering .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to fill the gap , and to get similar classification for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "case of @xmath12 ( see sect . [ secf3 ] ) is very similar to cases @xmath2 considered in @xcite because in this case we obtain k3 surfaces with non - degenerate non - symplectic involution .",
    "this non - degenerate case had been treated in @xcite in general .",
    "remarkably , enumeration of the connected components for @xmath12 case is equivalent to classification of some special integral polarized involutions classified in @xcite in general .",
    "thus , direct application of results of @xcite and @xcite solves the problem in this case .",
    "the case of @xmath12 is related with some very classical problems .",
    "firstly , k3 surfaces of this case can be also considered as k3 surfaces with fixed elliptic pencil and its section such that the elliptic pencil has no reducible fibres except one having the type corresponding to the extended dynkin diagram @xmath13 or @xmath14 .",
    "the inverse map of the group law of the elliptic pencil with the section gives then the non - symplectic involution .",
    "thus , we classify connected components of moduli of such real k3 surfaces . similarly ,",
    "the case of @xmath15 which had been treated in @xcite is equivalent to k3 surfaces having fixed elliptic pencil with section and no reducible fibres .",
    "secondly , the case of non - singular curves @xmath16 is equivalent to curves @xmath17 having no singular points except one quadratic ( possibly degenerate ) singular point .",
    "thus , we describe connected components of their moduli over @xmath18 too",
    ". see remark [ remf4f3 ] .",
    "thirdly , non - singular curves @xmath16 are equivalent to non - singular curves @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a del pezzo surface having no singular points except one log - terminal singular point of index two having the type @xmath21 , moreover , the genus @xmath22 ( see classification of log del pezzo surfaces of index @xmath23 in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , we classify connected components of moduli of real non - singular curves @xmath19 of such real del pezzo surfaces @xmath20",
    ". see remark [ remzf3 ] for details .",
    "the case of @xmath6 ( see sect . [ secf2 ] ) when we consider connected components of moduli of real non - singular curves @xmath24 is especially remarkable .",
    "it gives k3 surfaces with degenerate non - symplectic involution since @xmath6 has exceptional curves with square @xmath25 .",
    "thus , we can not directly apply results of @xcite where only non - degenerate case had been treated .",
    "fortunately , all main results of @xcite survive in this case , and we show that the connected component of moduli is also determined by the action @xmath26 of @xmath27 ( holomorphic non - symplectic involution ) and @xmath28 ( anti - holomorphic involution ) on the homology lattice @xmath29 of a k3 surface @xmath30 from this connected component .",
    "it is clear that only in very special cases of degenerate non - symplectic involutions on k3 similar result is valid .",
    "so , we are very lucky",
    ". it would be interesting to describe all similar nice cases in general , see remark [ remrootinvcompf2 ] .",
    "see @xcite about classification of k3 surfaces over @xmath31 with degenerate ( i.e. arbitrary ) non - symplectic involution .",
    "remarkably , enumeration of the connected components of moduli in the case of @xmath6 is also equivalent to classification of some special integral polarized involutions .",
    "thus , again application of results of @xcite and @xcite solves the problem .",
    "the case of @xmath6 is related with several classical problems .",
    "firstly , @xmath6 with contracted exceptional section is a quadratic cone in @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we solve very classical problem of enumeration of connected components of moduli of non - singular degree 8 curves on the quadratic cone in 3-dimensional space ( i. e. non - singular sections of the cone by degree four forms ) .",
    "[ subsecapp1f2 ] .",
    "deforming the cone to hyperboloid or ellipsoid , we obtain bidegree ( 4,4 ) non - singular curves on hyperboloid or ellipsoid ( the case of @xmath32 ) . combining our results here and results of @xcite",
    "we completely classify these deformations .",
    "this could be important in some very practical problems .",
    "see sects [ subsechypdeff2 ] and [ subsecelldeff2 ] .",
    "let us consider hyper - elliptically polarized k3 surfaces @xmath33 such that the linear system @xmath34 is hyper - elliptic and gives then a double covering @xmath35 .",
    "the case of @xmath36 gives _ hyper - elliptically polarized k3 surfaces @xmath33 of type @xmath6 .",
    "_ in this case , @xmath34 is double covering of @xmath6 ramified in a non - singular curve @xmath24 .",
    "thus , applying our results , we obtain classification of connected components of moduli of real hyper - elliptically polarized k3 surfaces of type @xmath6 .",
    "this finishes classification of connected components of moduli of real hyper - elliptically polarized k3 surfaces since for all other types similar classification had been obtained in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "moreover , we enumerate all types of these deformations .",
    "similar classification for all other types of real hyper - elliptically polarized k3 surfaces had been obtained in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , here we finalized these results .",
    "all our results here and in @xcite , @xcite are based on global torelli theorem @xcite and surjectivity of torelli map @xcite for k3 surfaces , and some geometric and arithmetic considerations .",
    "thus , our results are mainly existence and uniqueness results .",
    "it would be very interesting to construct exactly all representatives of connected components of moduli which we considered and classified .",
    "our results about deformations reduce everything to construction of representatives of connected components of moduli of real non - singular curves @xmath37 , @xmath38 , or degree 6 curves in @xmath39 . in many cases",
    "they are known by direct construction .",
    "e. g. see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it would be very interesting to have such constructions for all connected components of moduli .",
    "it will make our results effective and useful for some questions which do nt depend on deformation .",
    "this construction is surely possible because all our connected components of moduli are exactly labelled by some natural invariants , and number of the connected components is bounded .",
    "we always consider algebraic varieties over @xmath31 . if we say",
    " real \" , we consider algebraic varieties which are defined over @xmath18 .",

    "we denote by @xmath49 a fibre of the rational pencil . the canonical class @xmath50 and @xmath51 .    if @xmath52 , then a general element of the complete linear system @xmath1 is a non - singular curve .    if @xmath53 , then @xmath54 has the fixed component @xmath48 where the general element @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is union of two non - singular curves which intersect transversally in one point ( for @xmath4 , we then also call @xmath11 non - singular ) . if @xmath57 , then @xmath58 , and the whole curve @xmath59 is non - singular .    if @xmath60 , then @xmath61 has a non - reduced fixed component @xmath62 .",
    "thus , cases @xmath5 are characterized by the property that a general element of the complete linear system @xmath1 is reduced .    connected components of moduli of real non - singular curves in @xmath1 ( for real @xmath0 ) were classified in @xcite for @xmath2 . for",

    "all our results here ( and results of @xcite and @xcite as well ) are based on global torelli theorem @xcite and surjectivity of torelli map @xcite for k3 surfaces and some geometric and arithmetic considerations .",

    "it would be very interesting to have such constructions for all connected components of moduli .",
    "it will make our results effective and useful for some questions which do nt depend on deformation .",
