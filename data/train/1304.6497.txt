    "with large space - based and ground - based observational instruments operating , various large sky survey projects have obtained huge amounts of data in different bands .",
    "examples include infrared surveys ( two micron all sky survey , ukidss , wise ) , optical surveys ( usno , sdss ) , x - ray surveys ( rosat , chandra , xmm - newton ) , radio surveys ( first , nvss ) , and so on .",
    "all of these provide chances to study the multiwavelength properties of celestial objects .",
    "combining measurements from several instruments allows us to create spectral energy distributions of celestial objects in a range of wavelengths occupying a large part of the electromagnetic spectrum ( e.g. , shang et al . 2011 ) .",
    "multiwavelength studies may also lead to new discoveries .",
    "lodieu et  al .",
    "( 2012 ) cross - correlated the ukirt infrared deep sky survey ( ukidss ; lawrence et al . 2007 ) and the sloan digital sky survey data release 7 ( sdss dr7 ; abazajian et al .",
    "2009 ) and found new ultracool subdwarfs .",
    "scholz ( 2010 ) used ukidss data and their cross - correlation with sdss data to obtain 11 new t dwarf candidates .",
    "multiwavelength data also contribute to the improved accuracy of classification and photometric redshift estimation .",
    "laurino et  al .",
    "( 2011 ) discussed a novel method called weak gated experts for extracting quasar candidates and determining photometric redshifts . y@xmath2che",
    "( 2010 ) applied artificial neural networks for quasar selection and photometric redshift determination .",
    "wu & jia ( 2010 ) performed quasar candidate selection and photometric redshift estimation based on sdss and ukidss data .",
    "they proposed an empirical criterion in the @xmath3 versus @xmath4 color - color diagram to separate stars and quasars with redshift @xmath5 , and two other criteria for selecting high - redshift quasars . using the sdss - ukidss color - redshift relation , they estimated the photometric redshifts of 8498 sdss - ukidss quasars , and found that a significant increase of the photometric redshift accuracy was obtained compared to that based on the sdss color - redshift relation only .",
    "it has been suggested that active galactic nuclei ( agns , seyfert galaxies and quasars ) contributed to the x - ray background ( e.g. , comastri et  al .",
    "thus x - ray sky surveys may be helpful in detecting a significant population of agns .",
    "deeper x - ray extragalactic surveys performed by chandra and xmm - newton have greatly contributed to our knowledge of the formation and evolution of galaxies , clusters and groups of galaxies , and supermassive black holes ( e.g. , mushotzky et al . 2000 ; hasinger et al .",
    "such deep surveys are pencil - beam , in that even the widest one only covers a small part of the sky ( see review by brandt & hasinger 2005 ) . wide - field survey in the cosmos field covers an area of 2.13 deg@xmath6 , detected a total number of @xmath72000 sources ( cappelluti et al .",
    "the all - sky hard - x - ray surveys are quite shallow , e.g. , the 22 month swift / bat all - sky survey detected only 461 sources ( tueller et  al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "however , the xmm - newton observatory provides unrivalled capabilities for serendipitous x - ray surveys with the largest effective area .",
    "the xmm - newton serendipitous source catalog contains the largest number of sources ever obtained at x - ray energy ( watson et al .",
    "2009 ) . with the continual data release of xmm - newton and sdss",

    "georgakakis & nandra ( 2011 ) selected 209 sources detected in the 2 - 8 kev spectral band with sdss spectroscopic redshifts in the range @xmath8 from the xmm - newton survey of sdss dr7 sample .",
    "then they explored the color - magnitude diagram of the sample and compared it with that of x - ray - detected agns at @xmath9 in the aegis field ( nandra et al .",
    "they found no evidence for evolution of the x - ray agn host colors from @xmath10 to 0.8 .",
    "here we present cross - identified 2xmmi - dr3 catalog with the sdss dr8 ( aihara et  al .",
    "2011 ) sample . compared with previous work ( e.g. , pineau et  al .",
    "2011 ; georgakakis & nandra 2011 ) , we produce one of the largest x - ray / optical samples over a large area .",
    "note that only a small part of the 2xmmi sample ( 3622/262,902@xmath11 ) is covered by the sdss spectral survey .",
    "we will use this sample as part of the input catalog for the lamost ( large sky area multi - object fiber spectroscopic telescope ) optical spectroscopic surveys ( zhao et  al .",
    "2012 ; cui et  al .",
    "lamost ( also named the guo shou jing telescope ) is a chinese national scientific research facility operated by the national astronomical observatories , chinese academy of sciences .",
    "the aperture of lamost is 4 m , equipped with 4000 automatic optical fibers .",
    "lamost has begun carrying out its optical spectral survey of over 10 million stars and galaxies in the end of 2012 september .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 describes the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog , sdss dr8 and the details of the cross - identification of x - ray sources with sdss dr8 optical objects , provides the distribution of the main astrophysical classes of x - ray emitters in the optical and x - ray parameter space and shows how source classification could be done on this basis .",
    "section 3 presents the principle of the random forest algorithm and applies this algorithm to the automatic classification of x - ray emitters .",
    "section 4 summarizes this work and presents our conclusions .",
    "the xmm - newton satellite ( jansen et al .",
    "2001 ) was launched by the european space agency in late 1999 . the further incremental version of the second xmm - newton serendipitous source catalog , 2xmmi - dr3 catalog ( watson et al .",
    "2009 ) is the fifth publicly released xmm - newton x - ray source catalog produced by the xmm - newton survey science center consortium on behalf of esa .",
    "the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog , released on 2010 april 28 , has about 22% new detections when compared to the 2xmmi catalog and is the largest x - ray source catalog ever produced , containing @xmath12 times as many discrete sources as the rosat survey catalogs .",
    "2xmmi - dr3 complements deeper chandra and xmm - newton small - area surveys , probing a much larger sky area .",
    "the catalogue provides important information for large samples of various types of astrophysical objects including agns , clusters of galaxies , interacting compact binaries and active stellar coronae , with the power of x - ray selection .",
    "the large sky area covered by the serendipitous survey also means that 2xmmi - dr3 is a rich resource for exploring the variety of the x - ray source populations and identifying rare source types .",
    "the catalog contains 353,191 x - ray source detections which relate to 262,902 unique x - ray sources in the energy interval from 0.2 to 12 kev .",
    "the median flux of the total photon energy band ( 0.2 - 12 kev ) is @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 cm@xmath14 ; it is @xmath16 erg s@xmath14 cm@xmath14 in the soft energy band ( 0.2 - 2 kev ) , and it is @xmath17 erg s@xmath14 cm@xmath14 in the hard band ( 2 - 12 kev ) .",
    "about 20% of the sources have total fluxes below @xmath18 erg s@xmath14 cm@xmath14 .",
    "the typical accuracy of the source position is about 2 arcsec .      the sdss ( sdss , york et  al .",
    "2000 ) is an astronomical survey project , which covers more than a quarter of the sky , to construct the first comprehensive digital map of the universe in 3 three dimensions .",
    "a large amount of spectroscopic and photometric data has been obtained during the last several years by sdss , which has opened a new horizon for the study of galaxy properties such as galaxy evolution , clusters , redshifts , large - scale distribution of morphological type , and so on .    following the early data release and data releases 1 - 7 of sdss - i / ii",
    ", sdss - iii will collect data from 2008 to 2014 , using the 2.5 m telescope at apache point observatory .",
    "the eighth data release ( dr8 ) has been available since 2011 january .",
    "the release contains all of the imaging data taken by the sdss imaging camera ( now totalling over 14,000 deg@xmath19 ) , as well as new spectra taken by the sdss spectrograph during its last year of operation for the segue-2 project .",
    "all of the imaging data have been reprocessed using improved data processing pipelines .",
    "dr8 includes measurements for nearly 500 million stars , galaxies , and quasars , and nearly two million spectra .",
    "building on the legacy of sdss and sdss - ii , the main scientific aim of the sdss - iii collaboration is to map the milky way , search for extrasolar planets , and solve the mystery of dark energy .",
    "sdss - iii consists of four surveys ( boss , segue-2 , apogee , marvels ) , each focused on a different scientific theme .",
    "pineau et al . ( 2011 ) discussed the identification procedure between the 2xmmi catalog and sdss dr7 in detail . according to pineau et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , most sdss counterparts with a 2xmmi identification probability higher than @xmath7 90% are found less than 3 arcsec from the x - ray position .",
    "therefore in this work the cross - match radius between 2xmmi - dr3 catalogue and sdss dr8 is also set as 3 arcsec in order to keep higher identification possibility .",
    "then the nearest objects are taken as corresponding entries .",
    "cross - identifying the 2xmmi - dr3 catalogue with photometric archive of sdss dr8 and removing the default records , the number of entries is 51,500 .",
    "then we discard sdss entries with recorded magnitudes fainter than 22.2 in any of the photometric bands considered .",
    "we only study pointed sources with a positional error smaller than or equal to 5 arcsec and further handle the data meeting errors on @xmath20 to keep reliability of sample .",
    "then the number of entries in the 2xmm - sdss photometric sample is 31,809 .",
    "similarly , cross - matching the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog with the spectral archive of sdss dr8 and crossing out the default records , the number of objects is 3622 .",
    "given the sdss entries brighter than 22.2 mag , and the errors on @xmath21 as well as limiting the positional error smaller than or equal to 5 arcsec , the number of the 2xmm - sdss spectra sample becomes 3595 .",
    "detailed information about this sample is indicated in table 1 . in table  1 ,",
    "galaxy , qso and star are adopted from sdss dr8 spectra  class \" , their subtypes are from sdss dr8 spectra ` subclass ' .",
    "bl , sb and sf are short for broadline , starburst and starforming , respectively ; g represents the objects with  class\" = galaxy and default  subclass \" ; q indicates the objects with ` class'=qso and default ` subclass ' . the total number of galaxy , qso , and star is 1358 , 2120 , and 117 , separately .

    "we cross - correlate the 2xmmi - dr3 catalog containing 262902 unique x - ray sources with data release 8 of sdss including images for nearly 500 million stars , galaxies , and quasars , and spectra for nearly two million sources . since most sdss entries with a 2xmmi identification probability higher than @xmath790% are less than 3 arcsec from the x - ray position ( pineau et  al .",
    "2011 ) , the cross - match error radius is set to 3 arcsec . the standard processing of data is similar to that of pineau et  al . (",
    "2011 ) , so we can see whether or not there is improvement when the data is increased . due to more detailed spectral information of stars provided by sdss dr8 than by sdss dr7 ,",
    "x - ray properties of various spectral types of stars are easy to study .",
    "figures  1 - 3 show that extragalactic sources clusters , galaxies and quasars have different distributions , and stars are difficult to separate from extragalactic sources , but nevertheless , different types of stars have some distribution sequence , especially in figures .  1 and 3 .",
    "of x - ray active stars , cv and wd stars are stronger x - ray sources .",
    "the x - ray emission of other stars from early - type to late - type becomes weaker .",
    "4 also indicates that x - ray - emitting stars have a similar distribution to most stars .",
    "quasars and cv stars are stronger x - ray emitters .",
    "m stars are easily discriminated from other x - ray emitters .",
    "the random forest algorithm is applied to the cross - matched sample .",
    "the classification result further proves that quasars and galaxies are easy to distinguish from each other and x - ray - emitting stars are apt to be misclassified as galaxies or quasars .",
    "quasars and galaxies are seldom classified as stars . due to the small number of stars in this work , we only present a preliminary result .",
    "a more accurate and quantitative conclusion will be obtained with more data from x - ray emitting stars collected in future work . according to the distribution of photometric data and spectral data as well as classifiers created by random forest",
    ", it is convenient to select out quasar candidates and galaxy candidates .",
    "this is important in order to build complete samples of quasars or galaxies for statistical study .",
    "in addition , the classification results from different approaches are compared .",
    "when lacking a sufficiently trained sample , random forest shows its superiority .",
