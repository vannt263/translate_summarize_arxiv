    "the ohmic diffusion time scale in the interstellar medium ( ism ) is so long compared to the dynamical time scale that at first sight the magnetic field would appear to be perfectly frozen to the plasma .",
    "the ratio of these two time scales ,  the lundquist number @xmath2  is typically @xmath3 , implying ohmic diffusion times much longer than the age of the universe .",
    "the weakness of ohmic diffusion causes serious problems for galactic dynamo theory , which requires breaking the frozen - flux condition in order to convert small scale fields to large scale fields .",
    "more generally , it is difficult to reconcile the frozen - flux condition with the apparent smoothness of the magnetic field in the ism and the apparently turbulent nature of the interstellar velocity field .",
    "magnetic reconnection is a `` hybrid '' process which combines resistive and dynamical effects , and acts at a rate intermediate between them .",
    "when the reconnection rate depends on @xmath2 ( usually a power - law dependence ) , it is said to be slow .",
    "fast reconnection , by definition , proceeds at a rate independent of @xmath2 .",
    "it is generally accepted that in order for reconnection to cause a substantial breakdown of flux freezing in the ism , it must be fast .",
    "the reconnection theories of @xcite and @xcite have proven durable , and represent in some sense the `` default '' models , to which later work is usually compared . in the parker - sweet models ,",
    "two opposing magnetic field systems are pressed together , forming a current sheet at the magnetic null plane at which the field undergoes steady state , resistive annihilation . according to this model , the reconnection rate scales as @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite argued for changing the geometrical setup from reconnection in a current sheet to an x - point geometry . in this model ,",
    "the reconnection rate is proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "however , both numerical @xcite and analytical studies @xcite cast doubt on whether petschek s model is realizable , unless special conditions are met @xcite .",
    "another solution based on flow geometry was proposed by @xcite , who argued that fast reconnection occurs in the presence of turbulence at the resistive length scale ; see also @xcite .",
    "the solution to the fast reconnection problem could lie in physical processes outside the scope of single - fluid magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "the high electric current density expected in the reconnection layer may lead to instabilities which could generate small scale electromagnetic or electrostatic turbulence .",
    "scattering of electrons by such turbulence provides so - called anomalous resistivity ( see @xcite and references therein ) and increases the reconnection rate .",
    "if the current layers are sufficiently thin , electrons and ions may decouple @xcite .",
    "as @xcite argue , this can lead to reconnection at a rate independent of the resistivity .",
    "@xcite showed that the reconnection layer can be made thin if the gas pressure is reduced by progressive cooling .",
    "they found that a resistive region will form within a cooling time multiplied by @xmath6 , and that the magnetic field is dissipated within a few subsequent cooling times .",
    "however , as they argue , the temperature must be reduced by a factor of @xmath7 for this to happen . bearing in mind the value of @xmath2 in the ism ,",

    ", we consider ambipolar diffusion @xcite as a mechanism to reduce the reconnection layer width .",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of partial ionization on tearing instabilities in a sheared magnetic field .",
    "the reconnection rate is increased by a factor of @xmath8 , but the @xmath9-dependence found in the theory of @xcite is unchanged .",
    "@xcite considered parker - sweet reconnection in weakly ionized gas .",

    "@xcite showed that ambipolar diffusion steepens the magnetic profile in the vicinity of a magnetic null layer , and suggested that the resulting high current density could set the stage for magnetic reconnection .",
    "@xcite  hereafter bz95  found that although ion pressure tends to broaden the resistive layer and reduce the reconnection rate , a fast reconnection regime exists that is accessible under ism conditions .",
    "this paper is in some respects a followup of bz95 .",
    "we consider the steady state properties of a layer of weakly ionized gas around a field reversal , with the magnetic field fixed at the outer boundaries .",
    "we show by analytical arguments and a set of numerical models , that magnetic merging can be either fast or slow .",
    "the merging rate depends on a single parameter combining the ratio @xmath10 of ion pressure to magnetic pressure , the ohmic diffusivity @xmath0 , the ambipolar diffusivity @xmath11 , the recombination rate of ions , and the global length scale @xmath12 in the problem .",
    "our result suggests that fast merging of magnetic neutral sheets is possible in the weakly ionized interstellar gas .    in  [ sec :",
    "descanalytic ] we define the problem , quantify the relevant time scales , and develop an analytical model for predicting the reconnection rates .",
    "a numerical solution of the problem requires a solver which is able to handle the disparate time scales ; we describe the solver in  [ sec : descnumeric ] . in  [ sec : results ] , the numerical results are analyzed and compared with the analytical theory .",
    "we discuss the implications for the ism in  [ sec : physinterpret ] .",
    "section  [ sec : summary ] is a summary and discussion .",
    "before embarking on a mathematical representation of the problem , we describe the physical setup and identify the critical parameters which we would like to determine .",
    "we begin by summarizing reconnection theory of @xcite and @xcite , the main features of which have been confirmed by many subsequent calculations ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the basic configuration is sketched in figure  [ fig : sp ] , in the coordinate system which we will use throughout this paper .    opposing fields @xmath13",
    "are pressed together over a length @xmath14 , leading to a current sheet of width @xmath15 centered on @xmath16 .",
    "resistive dissipation of the current annihilates the field . in a steady state , magnetic flux must be brought in at the boundaries at the rate at which it is destroyed .",
    "the reconnection rate is parameterized by the speed @xmath17 at which the field is convected inwards , and determining this inflow speed in terms of the geometrical parameter @xmath14 and the intrinsic plasma parameters is one of the central problems of reconnection theory .    in parker - sweet theory ,",
    "@xmath17 is determined as follows .",
    "the electric field @xmath18 is assumed to be given by the standard mhd form of ohm s law @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the electrical conductivity . in the present problem",
    ", @xmath21 must be constant , because the system is in a steady state .",
    "we approximate @xmath22 by its inductive value @xmath23 everywhere except in the resistive region , where we approximate it by the expression @xmath24 . equating the resistive and inductive expressions for @xmath22 , and using ampre s law to write @xmath25 as @xmath26 , we find @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the magnetic diffusivity .",
    "a second relationship between @xmath15 and @xmath17 follows from conservation of mass .",
    "the inward mass flux @xmath29 must be balanced by outward mass flux in the form of thin jets within the resistive layer .",
    "energy conservation arguments suggest that these jets travel at the alfvn speed @xmath30 , implying an outward mass flux @xmath31 . equating the inward and outward mass fluxes yields @xmath32 combining equations  ( [ equ : lz1 ] ) and ( [ equ : lz2 ] ) yields expressions for @xmath17 and @xmath15 @xmath33 where the lundquist number @xmath2 is defined as @xmath34 in the interstellar medium , @xmath2 is generally enormous ( quantitative estimates follow in  [ subsec : dimlessformulation ] ) , while the alfvn crossing time is comparable to the dynamical time .",
    "equation  ( [ equ : usp ] ) therefore implies that reconnection is very slow .    in this paper",
    ", we express the reconnection rate in terms of the electric field . in parker - sweet reconnection , @xmath35 is given by @xmath36 where we have used equation  ( [ equ : usp ] ) .",
    "the relations  ( [ equ : usp ] ) and ( [ equ : lsp ] ) imply that the ohmic heating rate @xmath37 per unit volume is independent of @xmath0 @xmath38 where the second equality holds only in the resistive region .",
    "the poynting flux into the region , @xmath39 , is proportional to @xmath1 .",
    "we now consider the problem in weakly ionized gas .",
    "again , we assume a reversal in @xmath40 at @xmath16 . when the charged and neutral matter are strongly coupled",
    ", regions of magnetic field reversal can achieve force balance , with neutral pressure compensating for the deficit in magnetic pressure . reducing the coupling between neutrals and ions leads to ambipolar diffusion , in which case the neutrals lag behind the field lines .",
    "neutral pressure support is lost , and the ion pressure  which is much smaller than the neutral pressure  is overwhelmed by the magnetic pressure squeezing the antiparallel field lines together .",
    "the magnetic field gradients steepen around the magnetic null , leading to high current densities and ohmic dissipation .",
    "the basic situation is sketched in figure  [ fig : pressuresketch ] .",
    "an important simplification of the parker - sweet problem arises because the flux of ions is not conserved .",
    "recombination represents a sink , thus eliminating the need for an outflow and making a steady state possible in one dimension .",
    "although the system could develop 2d or 3d structure - and , as we discuss in  [ sec : summary ] this may be the only way to achieve fast reconnection under certain conditions - we treat only the 1d case here , because it is simplest and most tractable .",
    "in the spirit of our discussion of parker - sweet reconnection , we are interested in finding the scaling of the steady state inflow speed , or equivalently the electric field , with the ohmic diffusivity @xmath0 .",

    "we have generalized these equations to allow for a polytropic equation of state , @xmath41 , instead of the isothermal relation assumed in bz95 .",
    "the dynamics of the neutrals are neglected , because the neutrals are not coupled to the magnetic field and their pressure profile is essentially flat ( see fig .",
    "@xmath42 of bz95 ) .",
    "the ionization fraction is sufficiently small that the neutrals can be regarded as an infinite reservoir which can be supplemented by recombination with negligible effect on its overall properties .",
    "the ion flow is assumed slow enough that ion inertia can also be neglected . as we will see , this imposes a constraint on the width @xmath12 of the layers that can be described by these reduced equations .",

    "equation  ( [ equ : continuity ] ) is valid for photoionization or cosmic ray ionization , and for radiative or dissociative recombination , but not for surface recombination on grains , unless the grains are tied to the ions rather than the neutrals .",

    "thus , we expect two physically distinct regions , namely a resistive region around @xmath16 where @xmath54 dominates , and an inductive region for @xmath55 governed by the inductive term @xmath56 , just as occurs in the parker - sweet solution .      as the problem is largely one of time scale ratios , we rewrite equations  ( [ equ : momentum ] ) - ( [ equ : induction - integrated ] ) in a dimensionless form with the relevant time scales as physical parameters .",
    "we scale the physical variables as in table  [ tab : physcaledvars ] , and introduce the time scales in table  [ tab : timescales ] .",

    "our model is the simplest one possible .",
    "the flow is one dimensional , and the magnetic field vanishes at the midplane .",
    "thus , it is worth asking whether the model can be generalized . two dimensional flow , as in the parker - sweet model of reconnection , provides another mechanism for removing ions from the resistive layer .",
    "however , we already know that this leads to a slow reconnection rate",

    "bearing these caveats in mind , fast reconnection",
    " i.e. a reconnection rate independent of @xmath0  is possible within the model presented .",
    "the conditions which must be met are ( i ) a short ionization time , guaranteeing the fast removal of ions in the resistive layer and thus preventing a pressure build - up , and ( ii ) a negligible ion pressure in comparison to neutral and magnetic pressure .    as we saw in figure  ( [ fig : efld - length ] ) , the maximum merging speed is actually `` slow '' in the sense that it depends on @xmath0 as @xmath1 .",

    "<S> magnetic reconnection plays an essential role in the generation and evolution of astrophysical magnetic fields . </S>",
    "<S> the best tested and most robust reconnection theory is that of parker and sweet . according to this theory , the reconnection rate scales with magnetic diffusivity @xmath0 as @xmath1 . in the interstellar medium , </S>",
    "<S> the parker - sweet reconnection rate is far too slow to be of interest . </S>",
    "<S> thus , a mechanism for fast reconnection seems to be required . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the magnetic merging of two oppositely directed flux systems in weakly ionized , but highly conducting , compressible gas . in such systems , ambipolar diffusion steepens the magnetic profile , leading to a thin current sheet . </S>",
    "<S> if the ion pressure is small enough , and the recombination of ions is fast enough , the resulting rate of magnetic merging is fast , and independent of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> slow recombination or sufficiently large ion pressure leads to slower merging which scales with @xmath0 as @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we derive a criterion for distinguishing these two regimes , and discuss applications to the weakly ionized ism and to protoplanetary accretion disks . </S>"
