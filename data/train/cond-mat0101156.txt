    "in our previous work  @xcite , we have reported the possible values of exact critical exponents for the ginzburg ",
    "landau phase transition model predicted from a reorganized perturbation theory .",
    "these predictions are in exact agreement with the known exact and rigorous results in two dimensions  @xcite , and are equally valid also in three dimensions .",
    "our predictions have been compared to some original data of monte carlo ( mc ) simulations and experiments  @xcite , and a remarkable agreement has been found .",
    "however , there is still rather paradoxical and unclear situation regarding the mc results . on the one hand",
    ", we have shown theoretically  @xcite the invalidity of the conventional rg expansions  @xcite , but , on the other hand , the published papers on mc simulations usually claim to confirm the values of critical exponents coming from these expansions and being in contradiction to our results .",
    "contrary to the usual claims in the published papers that the values of critical exponents can be obtained from the monte carlo data with a striking accuracy , i.  e. with an error much smaller than @xmath11 , our expierence in analysis of several such data shows that in reality it is very difficult to extract accurate and reliable estimates therefrom .",
    "the problem is that a fitting of mc data to a simple theoretical ansatz ( including no corrections to scaling ) can provide a rather small statistical error , but the obtained result is not reliable since it contains an uncontrolled systematical error due to the neglected corrections to scaling .",
    "moreover , confluent ( i.  e. , those related to the universal properties of the critical point ) and analytical corrections can be equally important at finite values of the reduced temperature at which the simulations have been done , since the amplitude of the leading analytical correction can be remarkably larger than that of the confluent correction . our analysis of the susceptibility data for the three  dimensional heisenberg model ( sec .",
    "[ sec : gam ] ) has shown that the estimated value of the critical exponent @xmath12 decreases by several percents due to the confluent correction , and the result can be changed remarkably by the analytical correction too .",
    "thus , both kind of corrections should be taken into account , but this is not possible in the usual applications related to the determination of critical exponents , since inclusion of both kind of corrections in a theoretical ansatz strongly increases the statistical errors .    as regards the fitting of mc data at criticality , only confluent corrections are present , but the usual estimations are rather sensitive to the precise value of the critical coupling . in this aspect ,",
    "our estimation of the critical exponent @xmath7  @xcite from the mc simulated fractal dimensionality of the three  dimensional ising model at the critical point ( i.  e. , from mc data of  @xcite ) is preferable to a more conventional , but much more sensitive to the precise value of the critical coupling @xmath13 , estimation of this exponent from the susceptibility data at criticality .",
    "according to the published results  @xcite , the second method seems to give smaller values of @xmath7 in three dimensions ( about @xmath14 for heisenberg model  @xcite ) as compared to the first one ( about @xmath15 for ising model  @xcite ) , but the reason for the discrepancy could be an inaccuracy in the estimated value of @xmath13 . in the case of the heisenberg model , this value has been overestimated , indeed , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : coupl ] .",
    "more recent mc results reported in  @xcite also provide rather small values of @xmath7 ( about @xmath16 for @xmath17 models with @xmath18 ) .",
    "however , the infinite volume extrapolation in  @xcite is erroneous in view of our theory , and a selfconsistent treatment , based on our theoretical predictions , reveals no contradiction to the mc data ( sec .  [ sec : crex ] ) .    in the present work we have proposed a monte carlo test , based on a high quality susceptibility data  @xcite , where the above discussed problems with corrections to scaling are solved on a higher level than it has been done in the currently published papers .",
    "namely , our method enables us to test the agreement of mc data with given ( fixed ) theoretical values of critical exponents by taking into account both the leading confluent and the leading analytical correction .",
    "our test consists of a very accurate determination of the critical coupling followed by a fitting of the susceptibility data at criticality .",

    "one can expect that @xmath50 holds at @xmath29 ( which yields @xmath51 at @xmath52 and @xmath53 at @xmath54 ) and the only nonvanishing corrections are those of the order @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , since the known corrections to scaling for physical quantities , such as magnetization or correlation length , are analytical in the case of the two  dimensional ising model . here",
    "we suppose that the confluent corrections become analytical , i.  e. @xmath36 takes the value @xmath58 , at @xmath52 .",
    "besides , similar corrections to scaling are expected for susceptibility @xmath59 and magnetization @xmath60 since both these quantities are related to @xmath41 , i.  e. , @xmath38 and @xmath61 hold where @xmath62 is the volume and @xmath63 is the linear size of the system .",
    "the above limit is meaningful at @xmath64 , but @xmath65 may be considered as a definition of @xmath66 for finite systems too .",

    "our general hypothesis is that @xmath69 and @xmath70 monotoneously increase with @xmath20 to fit the known exponents for the spherical model at @xmath71 .",
    "in particular , we expect that @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath30 hold at @xmath74 and , probably , also in general .",

    "@xcite .",
    "we allow that different @xmath49 values correspond to the leading correction  to  scaling exponent for different quantities related to @xmath37 .",

    "the latter means , e.  g. , that the correlation length @xmath81 estimated from an approximate ansatz like @xmath82 $ ] used in  @xcite also contains a correction proportional to @xmath83 . since @xmath84 has a rather small value , the presence of such a correction ( and , presumably , also the higher order corrections @xmath85 , @xmath86 , etc . ) makes the above ansatz unsuitable for an accurate numerical correction  to  scaling analysis . due to this reason",
    "the susceptibility data , but not the correlation length data of ref .",
    "@xcite , are used in our further analysis .",
    "the correction @xmath83 is related to the correction @xmath87 in the finite  size scaling expressions at criticality .",
    "the existence of such a correction in the asymptotic expansion of the critical real  space green s ( correlation ) function , i.  e.@xmath88 where @xmath89 is a constant , is well confirmed by our recent ( preliminary ) results for the 2d  ising model . these results for @xmath90 have been obtained by an exact numerical transfer  matrix algorithm . in such a way",

    "it is noteworthy that a large variety of experimental measurements in ni discussed in  @xcite , confirm our values of critical exponents @xmath225 , @xmath226 , and @xmath227 rather than those of the rg theory ( @xmath4 , @xmath228 , and @xmath229  @xcite ) .",
    "in this section we discuss the recent mc results  @xcite for the complex zeroth of the partition function of the three  dimensional ising model .",
    "namely , if the coupling @xmath127 is a complex number , then the statistical sum has zeroth at certain complex values of @xmath127 or @xmath230 .",
    "the nearest to the real positive axis values @xmath231 and @xmath232 are of special interest . neglecting the second  order corrections , @xmath232 behaves like @xmath233 at large @xmath63 , where @xmath234 is the critical value of @xmath235 , @xmath236 and @xmath237 are complex constants , and @xmath238 is the correction  to  scaling exponent . according to the known results ( see , e.  g. , the solution given in  @xcite ) , the partition function zeroth correspond to complex values of @xmath239 located on a unit circle in the case of 2d ising model , so that @xmath236 is purely imaginar .",
    "the latter means that the critical behavior of real and imaginary parts of @xmath240 essentially differ from each other , i.  e. , @xmath241 and @xmath242 ( where , in this case of @xmath52 , @xmath243 ) at @xmath64 .",
    "the mc data of  @xcite , in fact , provide a good evidence that the same is true in three dimensions .    unfortunately , the authors of ref .",

    "[ sec : crex ] ( and with @xmath50 in  ( [ sec : crex ] ) to coincide with the known exact result at @xmath52 ) , is @xmath252 and @xmath253 , i.  e. , @xmath254 .    to obtain a more complete picture ,",
    "we have considered separately the real part and the imaginary part of @xmath255 .",
    "we have calculated @xmath232 from @xmath231 data listed in tab .",
    "i of  @xcite and have estimated the effective critical exponents @xmath256 and @xmath257 , separately for @xmath258 and @xmath259 , by fitting these quantities to an ansatz @xmath260 and @xmath261 , respectively , at sizes @xmath63 and @xmath262 . the value of @xmath263 consitent with high and low temperature series  @xcite as well as mc  @xcite estimations of the critical coupling , @xmath264 , have been used .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ zeroth ] .",
    "as we see , @xmath265 ( empty circles ) claims to increase above @xmath266 ( solid circles ) when @xmath63 increases .",
    "this is a good numerical evidence that , like in the two  dimensional case , the asymptotic values are @xmath267 and @xmath268 . according to our theory ,",
    "the actual plots in the @xmath269 scale are linear at @xmath64 , as consistent with the expansion in terms of @xmath270 .",
    "the linear least  squares fits are shown by solid lines .",
    "the zero intercepts @xmath271 and @xmath272 are in approximate agreement with our theoretical values @xmath273 and @xmath274 indicated by horizontal dashed lines .",
    "the relative discrepancy of about @xmath275 , presumably , is due to the extrapolation errors and inaccuracy in the simulated data .",
    "the behavior of @xmath265 is rather inconsistent with the rg predictions . on the one hand",
    ", @xmath265 claims to increase above @xmath266 and also well above the rg value of @xmath276 ( the lower dod  dot  dashed line at @xmath277 ) , and , on the other hand , the extrapolation yields @xmath278 value ( @xmath272 ) which is remarkably smaller than @xmath279 ( the upper dot  dot  dashed line ) predicted by the rg theory . for selfconsistency , we should use the linear extrapolation in the scale of @xmath270 with @xmath280 ( the rg value ) .",
    "however , this extrapolation ( tiny dashed line in fig .",
    "[ zeroth ] ) , yielding @xmath281 , does not solve the problem in favour of the rg theory .",
    "the data points of @xmath265 look ( and are expected to be ) less accurate than those of @xmath266 , since @xmath258 has a very small value .",
    "the @xmath266 data do not look scattered , therefore they allow a refined analysis with account for nonlinear corrections . to obtain stable results",
    ", we have included the data for smaller lattice sizes @xmath282 and @xmath283 given in  @xcite . in principle , we can use rather arbitrary analytical function @xmath284 to evaluate the effective critical exponent @xmath285 / \\ln 2\\ ] ] and estimate its asymptotic value @xmath286 . for an optimal choice",
    ", however , @xmath257 vs @xmath270 plot should be as far as possible linear to minimize the extrapolation error . in this aspect ,",
    "our choice @xmath287 is preferable to @xmath288 used in  @xcite .",
    "we have tested also another possibility , i.  e. @xmath289 , providing almost optimal results in the case of 2d ising model . in fig .",
    "[ slope ] we have shown the slope of @xmath266 vs @xmath269 curve , calculated from the mc data of  @xcite , for @xmath290 ( empty circles ) and @xmath289 ( solid circles ) .",
    "it is evident that in both cases the slope can not be reasonably approximated by a linear function of @xmath269 , but can be quite well described by a parabola .",
    "the latter means that @xmath257 can be satisfactory well approximated by a third  order ( but not by a second  order ) polinomial in @xmath269 .",
    "the corresponding four parameter least  squares fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ zeroref ] .",
    "they yield @xmath291 in the case of @xmath287 ( long  dashed line ) and @xmath292 at @xmath293 ( solid line ) .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ zeroref ] that in the latter case we have slightly better linearity of the fit , therefore @xmath8 is our best estimate of the critical exponent @xmath276 from the actual mc data .",
    "thus , while the row estimation provided the value @xmath294 which is closer to the rg prediction @xmath295 ( horizontal dot  dot  dashed line ) , the refined analysis reveals remarkably better agreement with our ( exact ) value @xmath9 ( horizontal dashed line ) .",
    "in summary , we conclude the following .    1 .",
    "corrections to scaling for different physical quantities near and at criticality have been discussed in framework of our recently developed theory  @xcite ( sec .",
    "[ sec : crex ] ) .",

    "[ sec : gam ] ) .",
    "the obtained estimates ( @xmath160 and @xmath296 ) agree within error bars with our theoretical value @xmath162 and disagree with the conventional rg value @xmath4 .",
    "taking into account also the leading analytical correction , a selfconsistent estimation always yields the central value of @xmath12 in the range of @xmath297 , i.  e. , reasonably close to our ( exact ) value @xmath298 , if the ratio of amplitudes @xmath89 for analytical and confluent corrections is varied from @xmath299 to @xmath300 .",

    "a very accurate estimation of the critical coupling has been made at given values of critical exponents ( sec .  [ sec : coupl ] ) , taking into account both confluent and analytical corrections to scaling .",
    "these estimates , combined with fits in vicinity of the critical point ( sec .",
