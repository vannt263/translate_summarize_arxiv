    "in many gtr tests several observations from space probes are confronted to predictions for them computed with given dynamical models .",
    "the relativistic effect to be tested is explicitly included in them , with one or more solve - for parameters @xmath4 accounting for it to be estimated in a least - square fashion , along with many other ones @xmath5 not directly pertaining gtr . of crucial importance for interpreting such data analyses as genuine tests of gtr",
    "is to clarify how the numerical values of the models parameters @xmath6 which have not been solved - for have originally been obtained .",
    "the point is that the standard data reduction procedure used for the original goals of the missions , now exploited for gtr testing , may not be valid , in principle , for performing a truly unbiased , genuine check of gtr which is not a . indeed ,",
    "if the primary task of a space - based mission is , for example , to reach a certain astronomical target with a given accuracy , the only thing that is important to this aim is that the dynamical models adopted to predict the probe s motion are accurate enough ; this is usually quantitatively judged by inspecting the post - fit residuals of some directly measurable quantities like , e.g. , ranges or range - rates .",
    "how the parameters @xmath6 entering the models have been obtained , i.e. their a - priori reference values , does not matter at all : the only important thing is that the resulting fit of an existing set of observations is good enough to minimize the observable s residuals .",
    "such an approach may , in principle , not be entirely adequate when the goal of the data analysis is testing a gravitational theory like gtr in an unambiguous , unbiased and self - consistent way . in this case , how the fixed parameters @xmath6 of the models have been obtained does , in fact , matter .",
    "indeed , if one or more of them @xmath7 were previously obtained from different data of different bodies in such a way that they somehow retain a non - negligible a - priori of the same effect we are now interested in , their use may bias the current test just towards the desired outcome yielding , for example , a very high accuracy confirmation . in this cases , it would be more correct to use , if possible , values of such parameters @xmath7 which have been obtained independently of the effect itself whose existence we are just testing in the present data analysis , even if the accuracy of such different values of the parameters @xmath7 was worse . alternatively ,",
    "if , for some reasons , such values are not available , @xmath7 should be included , if possible , in the list of the solved - for parameters along with the one(s ) @xmath4 accounting for the effect to be tested , and the resulting covariance matrix should be checked to inspect the correlations among them .",
    "to be more definite , let us look at the cassini radio science test . in that case , the radiotechnical data of the spacecraft traveling to saturn were contrasted with a set of dynamical models by jpl of its motion and electromagnetic waves propagation in such a way that a correction @xmath8 to the gtr - predicted value of the ppn parameter @xmath2 was solved for , among other parameters , obtaining@xcite |- 1|=(2.12.3)10 ^ -5;other authors",
    "got@xcite |- 1|=(-1.35.2)10 ^ -5.now , a physical parameter which is crucial in such a test is the gravitational constant @xmath0 of the sun , which is the source of the relativistic time delay .",
    "it was not estimated @xcite , so that its numerical value was kept fixed to the standard reference figure of the jpl de ephemerides .",
    "it does , in principle , contain an a - priori by gtr itself through the same effect itself that was just tested with cassini , in particular by @xmath2 itself .",
    "indeed , the numerical value of @xmath0 comes from the fixed value of the defining gaussian constant k = 0.01720209895  au^3/2  d^-1,and from the value of the astronomical unit in m , not estimated in the cassini tests , = 1.4959787069110 ^ 11  ( 3 )  mthrough gm _",
    "= k^2  au^3  d^-2 = 1.3271244001810 ^ 20  ( 810 ^ 9 )  m^3  s^-2.au was , in fact , obtained just through a combination of radar ranging of mercury , venus , and mars , laser ranging of the moon ( making use of light reflectors left on the lunar surface by apollo astronauts ) , and timing of signals returned from spacecraft as they orbit or make close passes of objects in the solar system@xcite ; thus , as we will show below , it is affected in a non - negligible way , given the level of accuracy of the techniques adopted , by gtr itself and , in particular , by @xmath2 which enters the ppn expressions for the time delay and bending of traveling electromagnetic waves .",
    "thus , there exists , in principle , the possibility that the high - accuracy results of the cassini radio science tests may retain an a - priori of gtr itself through @xmath0 ( and the astronomical unit as well ) .",
    "let us put our hypothesis on the test by making some specific calculations ; for the sake of clarity , we will refer to the cassini radio science tests , but the conclusions may be considered valid also for any of the many proposed @xmath9dedicated missions . the gtr time delay experienced by electromagnetic waves propagating from point 1 to point 2 is t = ( ) , where @xmath10 is the sun s schwarzschild radius ; @xmath11 is the heliocentric coordinate distance to point 1 , @xmath12 is the heliocentric coordinate distance to point 2 , and @xmath13 is the distance between the points 1 and 2 . is the expression actually used in the jpl s orbit determination program ( odp ) used to analyze interplanetary ranging with planets and probes . in order to quantitatively evaluate the level of by gtr itself in the used value of the astronomical unit ,",
    "let us assume @xmath11 equal to the earth - sun distance and let us vary @xmath12 within 0.38 au and 1.5 au to account for the ranging to inner planets ; the maximum effect occurs at the superior conjunction , i.e. when @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath16 s , which is certainly not negligible with respect to the accuracy of the order of @xmath17 s with which the light - time for times the round trip travel time @xmath18 of electromagnetic waves sent from the earth and reflected back by the target body , and confronting it with the distance , expressed in au , between the earth and the target body at the same epoch as predicted by some accurate dynamical ephemeris @xcite . ]",
    "1 au @xmath19 is actually measured ( http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?constants ) . as a consequence , the quantitative impact of the interplanetary ranging in the inner solar system to the determination of the astronomical unit is of the order dau = ct_ranging = 1.1429110 ^ 5  m , not negligible with respect to the meter - level accuracy in measuring the astronomical unit ; thus , @xmath20au@xmath21au@xmath22 .",
    "differentiating with respect to au and yields = 210 ^ -6.thus , we conclude that the technique adopted to determine the numerical values of the astronomical unit and of the sun s @xmath23 induced an a - priori of gtr on them of @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "let us apply this result to a typical radio science experiment in the solar system with @xmath11 fixed to the earth - sun distance . by writing @xmath26 au , with @xmath27 expressing distances in astronomical units , differentiation of with respect to au and @xmath0 , and - yield an effect of the order of.|_gtr = 210 ^",

    "au ; it turns out that the largest contribution comes from @xmath28 .",
    "it is too small by one order of magnitude with respect to the performed cassini radio science tests , but it should be taken into account in the future , more accurate experiments whose expected accuracy is of the order of @xmath3 , in the sense that the a - priori bias of gtr in the future determinations of deviations of @xmath2 from unity will be as large as , or even larger than the effects one will to test , unless either @xmath0 will be estimated as well along with @xmath2 itself or a value obtained independently of it will be adopted .",
