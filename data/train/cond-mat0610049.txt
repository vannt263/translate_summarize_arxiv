    "multifractal analysis of fluctuating signals is a widely applied method to characterize complexity on many scales in classical dynamics @xcite , or in the analysis of a given time series ( without any a priori knowledge on the underlying dynamical system which generated the series ) @xcite .    on the quantum level",
    ", multifractal behaviour was found in the scaling of eigenfunctions in solid - state transport problems @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , there have been , however , very few attempts to use the method of multifractal analysis to directly characterize transport properties such as conductance ( across a solid state sample ) or the survival probability ( in open , decaying systems ) .",
    "often it is indirectly argued that the multifractal structure of the wave functions at critical points ( at the crossover between the localized and the extended regime ) imprints itself on the scaling of transport coefficients @xcite .",
    "other works found a fractal scaling of _ local _ transport quantities , such as hopping amplitudes @xcite or two - point correlations @xcite . at criticality",
    "@xcite predicts , e.g. , a multifractal scaling of the two - point conductance between two small interior probes within the transporting sample .    in this paper",
    ", we directly study the fluctuations properties of a _",
    "global _ conductance like quantity in a regime of _ strong localization _ ( anderson or dynamical localization in our context of quantum dynamical systems ) .",
    "the studied quantity is the survival probability of an open , classically chaotic system , which in the deep quantum realm was found to obey a monofractal scaling if certain conditions on the quantum eigenvalue spectrum are fulfilled @xcite . in particular",
    ", the distribution of decay rates of the weakly opened system needs to obey a power - law with an exponent @xmath1 , which translates into an analytic prediction for the corresponding box counting dimension ( of the survival probability as a function of a proper scan parameter ) : @xmath2 .",
    "a more detailed , yet preliminary numerical analysis of the decay rate distribution for our model system ( to be introduced below ) has found that two scaling regions can be identified @xcite . while for small rates the probability density function @xmath3 scales as @xmath4 , at larger scales it turns to @xmath5  which is expected for strongly transmitting channels from various models for transport through disordered systems @xcite .",
    "here we ask ourselves whether this prediction of a smooth variation in the scaling of the monofractal behaviour ( induced by the smoothly changing exponent @xmath6 ) can be generalized to characterize the fluctuations on many scales using from the very beginning the technique of multifractal analysis .",
    "before we present our findings on the multifractal scaling of the parametric fluctuations of the survival probability , we introduce the kicked rotor system and our numerical algorithm for the multifractal analysis in the subsequent two sections .",
    "the @xmath0kicked rotor is a widely studied , paradigmatic toy model of classical and quantum dynamical theory @xcite . using either cold or ultracold atomic gases",
    ", the kicked rotor is realised experimentally by preparing a cloud of atoms with a small spread of initial momenta , which is then subjected to a one - dimensional optical lattice potential , flashed periodically in time @xcite . in good approximation",
    ", the hamiltonian for the experimental realization of the rotor on the line ( in one spatial dimension ) reads in dimensionless units @xcite : @xmath7 the derivation of the one - period quantum evolution operator exploits the spatial periodicity of the potential by bloch s theorem @xcite .",
    "this defines quasimomentum @xmath8 as a constant of the motion , the value of which is the fractional part of the physical momentum @xmath9 in dimensionless units @xmath10 . since @xmath8 is a conserved quantum number , @xmath9 can be labelled using its integer part @xmath11 only .",
    "the spatial coordinate is then substituted by @xmath12 and the quantum momentum operator by @xmath13 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the one - kick quantum propagation operator for a fixed @xmath8 is thus given by @xcite @xmath14    in close analogy to the transport problem across a solid - state sample , we follow @xcite to define the quantum survival probability as the fraction of the atomic ensemble which stays within a specified region of momenta while applying absorbing boundary conditions at the `` sample '' edges . if we call @xmath15 the wave function in momentum space and @xmath16 the edges of the system , absorbing boundary conditions are implemented by setting @xmath17 if @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "this truncation is carried out after each kick , and it mimics the escape of atoms out of the spatial region where the dynamics induced by the hamiltonian ( [ eq : ham ] ) takes place .",
    "if we denote by @xmath20 the projection operator on the interval @xmath21n_{1},n_{2}[$ ] the survival probability after @xmath22 kicks is : @xmath23    the early studies of the fluctuation properties of @xmath24 focused on its parametric dependence on the quasimomentum @xmath8 @xcite . while @xmath8 is hard to control experimentally on a range of many scales ( with a typical uncertainty of 0.1 in experiments with an initial ensemble of _ ultra_-cold atoms @xcite ) , some of us recently proposed to investigate the parametric fluctuations as a function of the kicking period @xmath25 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham ] ) ) , which can be easily controlled on many scales in the experimental realization of the model even with laser - cooled ( just `` cold '' ) atoms @xcite .    in figure 1",
    "we present the survival probability @xmath24 of the opened kicked rotor in the deep quantum regime ( i.e. , at kicking periods @xmath26 @xcite ) as a function of the two different scan parameters @xmath8 and @xmath25 .",
    "the global oscillation with a period of the order 1 in fig .",
    "1(a ) originates from the @xmath8-dependent phase term @xmath27 in the evolution operator ( [ eq : evol ] ) , and can be understood qualitatively by remembering the bloch band structure of the corresponding quasienergy spectrum as a function of @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "no such oscillating trend is found for the graph as a function of the kicking period .",
    "nonetheless , in the following , we use a well developed variation of the standard multifractal algorithm , which intrinsically takes account of such global , yet irrelevant trends in the signal function @xmath28 . the basic feature of the _ multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis _ ( mf - dfa ) @xcite",
    "are now explained before we present our central results which indicate the multifractal scaling of data sets as the ones shown in fig .",
    "the mf - dfa is a generalization of the dfa method originally proposed by @xcite , and it is extensively described in @xcite . in the recent years",
    "it was used , for instance , to investigate the nonlinear properties of nonstationary series of wind speed records @xcite , electro - cardiograms @xcite , and financial time series @xcite .",
    "the method consists of five steps .",
    "first the series @xmath29 is integrated to give the profile function : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the average value of @xmath32 .",
    "the profile can be considered as a random walk , which makes a jump to the right if @xmath33 is positive or to the left side if @xmath34 is negative . in order to analyze the fluctuations ,",
    "the profile is divided into @xmath35 non - overlapping segments of length @xmath36 , and , since usually @xmath37 is not an integer multiple of @xmath36 , to avoid the cutting of the last part of the series , the procedure is repeated backwards starting from the end to the beginning of the data set . in each segment",
    "@xmath38 we subtract the local polynomial trend of order @xmath39 and we compute the variance : @xmath40-y_\\nu^{k}(i)\\right\\}^2\\;,\\ ] ] for @xmath41 , and @xmath42-y_\\nu^k(i)\\right\\}^2\\;,\\ ] ] with @xmath43 for the backward direction .",
    "the order of the polynomial defines the order of the mf - dfa too , therefore we may speak about mf - dfa(1 ) , mf - dfa(2 ) , ... , mf - dfa(@xmath39 ) .",
    "the fourth step consists on the averaging of all segments to obtain the @xmath44-th order fluctuation function for segments of size @xmath36 : @xmath45^{q/2}\\right\\}^{1/q}.\\ ] ]    in the last step we determine the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation function by analyzing the log - log plots of @xmath46 versus @xmath36 for each value of @xmath44 .",
    "if the series is long - range correlated @xmath46 increases for large @xmath36 as a power law : @xmath47 since the number of segments becomes too small for very large scales ( @xmath48 ) , we usually exclude these scales for the fitting procedure to determine @xmath49 .",
    "the mf - dfa reduces to the standard dfa for @xmath50 , while the scaling exponent @xmath49 can be related to the standard multifractal analysis considering stationary time series , in which @xmath51 is identical to the hurst exponent @xmath52 , therefore , @xmath49 can be considered a generalized hurst exponent .",
    "monofractal series indeed show a very weak or no dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath44 .",
    "by example , for monofractal series as white noise , the generalized hurst exponent is @xmath53 for all @xmath44 . on the contrary , for multifractal time series , @xmath49 is a function of @xmath44 and this dependence influences the multifractality of the process . referring to the formalism of the partition function : @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the renyi exponent , to which the @xmath49 is related by : @xmath56 now we are able to use the formalism of the multifractal spectrum @xcite @xmath57 to characterize the data set : @xmath58 + 1 \\;. \\end{split}\\ ] ] the generalized dimensions are expressed as a function of @xmath55 or @xmath49 @xcite : @xmath59 which can not be not straightforwardly defined for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .    if the signal is multifractal , the spectrum @xmath57 has approximately the form of an inverted parabola . as significative parameters for its characterization we considered the point @xmath62 corresponding to the maximum of @xmath57 , and its width @xmath63 considered for a fixed @xmath44 interval . in other words",
    ", @xmath62 represents the @xmath64 value at which is situated the `` statistically most significant part '' of the time series ( i.e , the subsets with maximum fractal dimension among all subsets of the series ) .",
    "the width @xmath63 is related to the dependence on @xmath49 from q. the stronger this dependence , the wider is the fractal spectrum ( cf . , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fa ] ) ) .",
    "we performed a mf - dfa of order @xmath65 on data sets produced by scanning the @xmath8 or @xmath25 parameter , respectively , over @xmath66 data points , and considering different interaction times from @xmath67 to @xmath68 kicks .",
    "the analysis performed with higher order ( @xmath69 and 3 ) polynomial detrending for some of the series produced basically the same results .",
    "furthermore , we tested our numerical algorithm on a monofractal time series ( white noise ) and a well known multifractal process ( binomial multifractal model @xcite ) .",
    "for these two test series we reproduce the known analytical resuls , with a precision better than @xmath70 .",
    "a full analysis for @xmath71 ( see figure 1 ) is shown in figures 2 and 3 for the @xmath8 and @xmath25 scanned series , respectively .",
    "tables [ tab : beta ] and [ tab : tau ] collect the multifractal parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 , which were computed for @xmath72 .",
    "analogously to @xcite , we defined @xmath63 as the width of the parabolic form of @xmath57 between the points corresponding to @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "figure 2(a ) shows the scaling behaviour of the fluctuation function @xmath46 , with @xmath75 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath36 represents the index of the scanning parameter @xmath8 , while the fit was performed in the zone @xmath76 $ ] ( corresponding to @xmath77 $ ] ) . in figure 2(b ) we report the dependence of @xmath49 on @xmath44 , revealing the multifractal nature of the data set . in order to better characterize the multifractality and to highlight how it changes among the different analyzed series ,",
    "we have computed the mf spectrum @xmath57 ( c.f .",
    "2(c ) ) . figure 2(d ) shows the variation of the multifractal parameters for the different interaction times considered . after a fast decrease ,",
    "both the parameters tend to converge around the values @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( see also tab . [",
    "tab : beta ] ) .",
    "very similar results were obtained for the @xmath25 scanned series ( cf .",
    ", figure 3 and table [ tab : tau ] ) . comparing the values of tables [",
    "tab : beta ] and [ tab : tau ] we can say that both the @xmath25 and the @xmath8 scanned series have essentially the same multifractality",
    ".    even if we can not a priori predict the asymptotic similarity between the two series of @xmath25 and @xmath8 , we can a posteriori interpret this result : both parameters enter not equally yet similarly in the _ phase _ of the second factor on the right of eq .",
    "( 2 ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the restriction of @xmath8 to the unit interval does make no difference to the , in principle , unboundedness of @xmath25 ( in fact , to avoid different dynamical properties of the system , @xmath25 was chosen in a restricted window too , c.f .",
    "@xcite ) .    in general , two types of multifractality can be distinguished , and both of them require different scaling exponents for small and large fluctuations .",
    "( i ) the multifractality can be due to the broad probability density function for the values , and ( ii ) it can also be due to different long range correlations for small and large fluctuations .",
    "the simplest way to distinguish between the mentioned two cases is to perform the analysis on a randomly reshuffled series .",
    "the shuffling destroys all the correlations , and the series with multifractals of type ( ii ) will exhibit a monofractal behaviour with @xmath80 and @xmath81 . on the contrary , multifractality of type ( i )",
    "is not affected by the shuffling procedure .",
    "if both ( i ) and ( ii ) are present the series will show a weaker multifractality than the original one .",
    "we applied the shuffling procedure to the series showed in figure 1 .",
    "the procedure destroyed the multifractality of both series since for both the sequences we obtained @xmath82 for @xmath75 $ ] .",
    "the dependence on @xmath44 was so weak that we were not able to compute any reliable @xmath57 spectrum , which , in this case , can be considered singular , i.e. , with @xmath83 .",
    "we studied the quantum kicked rotor , a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos , which describes the time evolution of cold atoms in periodically flashed optical lattices .",
    "imposing absorbing boundary conditions allows one to probe the transport properties of the system , here expressed by the survival probability on a finite region in momentum space . for a fixed interaction time",
    ", the quantum survival probability depends sensitively on the parameters of the system , and our application of the detrended multifractal method shows that _ clear signatures of a multifractal scaling of the survival probability _ are found , as either the kicking period or quasimomentum is scanned .",
    "our results generalize the previously predicted _",
    "mono_-fractal structure of the signal @xcite , by characterizing long - range correlations in the parametric fluctuations . in agreement with the monotonic increase of the box counting dimension with the interaction time @xmath22 and its saturation",
    "after @xmath84 observed in @xcite , we found a systematically decreasing value for the maximum @xmath62 of the mf spectrum and of its widths @xmath85 .",
    "both of these two values also tend to saturate for @xmath84 .",
    "future work along the lines of @xcite will be devoted to check in detail whether traces of the here predicted multifractality could be observed under real - life experimental conditions ( e.g. , for short interaction times and finite resolutions in the scanning parameter @xcite ) .",
