    "the nature of the dynamics of networks of coupled oscillators and their complex behaviors have been studied for many years @xcite .",
    "nowadays considerable interest is shown on analyzing the questions regarding the emergence of chimera states .",
    "these states are characterized by the coexistence of both synchronized and desynchronized behaviors of coupled identical oscillators .",
    "such a remarkable phenomenon was initially found in nonlocally coupled identical oscillators @xcite .",
    "it has been subsequently studied in globally coupled oscillator networks @xcite , planar oscillators @xcite , heterogeneous networks @xcite , oscillators with more than one populations @xcite , two dimensional map lattices @xcite and experimentally in chemical oscillators @xcite , an optical system @xcite , electrochemical @xcite and coupled mechanical oscillators @xcite .",
    "they have also been identified in certain locally coupled systems @xcite as well .",
    "many theoretical , numerical and experimental investigations deal with a single population consisting of identical oscillators .",
    "however systems under various situations including ensembles of oscillators with more than one population and introduction of coupling asymmetries are less investigated till date . owing to the strong resemblance of chimera states with real world applications , investigation around the chimera states",
    "is even more important due to the strong relevance of such states with many natural phenomena including unihemispheric sleep of certain mammals and birds where one brain hemisphere appears to be inactive while the other remains active @xcite , ventricular fibrillation @xcite ( one of the primary causes of sudden cardiac death in humans ) , blackouts of power grid networks @xcite , social systems @xcite(organization of coupled populations ) , neural systems @xcite ( firing patterns of neurons , coordinated and uncoordinated brain activity , etc . ) and so on .",
    "moreover another interesting pattern , namely imperfect chimera state is reported in @xcite with coupled pendula and this state is characterized by a certain small number of solitary oscillators ( solitary state @xcite ) which escapes from the synchronized chimera s cluster ( where solitary oscillator represents a single repulsive oscillator splitting up from the fully synchronized group ) .",
    "such escaped oscillators oscillate with different average frequencies . a novel mechanism for the creation of chimera states via the appearance of the solitary states",
    "is also reported in kuramoto model with inertia @xcite and with time delayed feedback oscillators @xcite . in the present study we aim to investigate different kinds of imperfect synchronized states and chimera states ( for spatially prepared initial conditions ) in two interacting populations of nonlocally",
    "coupled oscillators .",
    "the imperfect synchronized state here is characterized by a certain small number of solitary oscillators exhibiting quasi - periodic oscillations which escapes from the synchronized group .",
    "taking into account the above facts , we study the dynamics of nonlocally coupled two interacting populations of stuart - landau oscillators .",
    "we are interested to investigate how does the nonisochronicity parameter ( @xmath0 ) affect the emergence of different kinds of imperfect synchronized states and chimera states in such a system with nonlocal coupling .",
    "we find that for given strengths of inter- and intra - population couplings the emergence of imperfect synchronized states for sufficiently smaller values of nonisochronicity parameter ( @xmath0 ) which means that the synchronized and escaped oscillators from synchronized state exist within population - ii while the population - i remains synchronized . by increasing the strength of this parameter",
    ", we find that the synchronized oscillators from both the populations get locked to a common average frequency while the solitary oscillators are distributed with random average frequencies and we term such a state as a mixed imperfect synchronized state .",
    "in addition , synchronized oscillators exhibit periodic motion around the origin , whereas the desynchronized oscillators exhibit quasiperiodic motion but their center of rotation is shifted from the origin . in this region , for spatially prepared initial conditions",
    ", we can observe the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized oscillations in both the populations , namely mixed chimera states , which is distinct from the results discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite where the chimera state represents the complete synchronization in one population while desynchronization occurs among the oscillators in the other population under global coupling",
    ". we can also find that the imperfect synchronized states can drift with time by increasing the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "we also find that these states are robust against an introduction of frequency mismatch between the natural frequencies of the population with significant values of nonisochronicity parameter .",
    "the structure of the paper is organized as follows . in section - ii , we introduce the model of two interacting populations of nonlocally coupled stuart - landau oscillators and present the different dynamical states including mixed chimera states , imperfect synchronized states , mixed imperfect synchronized states and drifted imperfect synchronized states . in section - iii , we illustrate the robustness of these states for the introduction of frequency mismatch between the two populations .",
    "we summarize our findings in section - iv .",
    "to appreciate the results mentioned above , we consider a system of nonlocally coupled two populations of stuart - landau oscillators which is described by the following set of coupled equations ,    @xmath1 where the complex dynamical variables @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath0 is the nonisochronicity parameter , @xmath4 is the natural frequency of the oscillators , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 represent the strengths of the coupling interactions within and between the populations , respectively . in system ( [ g ] ) , each oscillator is coupled with @xmath7 oscillators within its group and @xmath8 oscillators with the other group . here",

    "generally communities of oscillatory network consisting of interacting subpopulations are common in many natural systems .",
    "for example , observation of neuronal activity is taken from different regions of the brain which forms a network of interacting subpopulations of the brain @xcite .",

    "we find that when these states are not stable in the sense that , they can drift with time on increasing the value of the nonischronicity parameter .",
    "we have also verified with two parameter phase diagrams that these states can also be observed against the introduction of the frequency mismatch between the two populations .",
    "one can observe the mixed imperfect synchronized state in the presence of mismatch only if the nonisochronicity parameter is sufficiently large to dominate the effect of frequency mismatch between the two populations .",
    "interestingly , we also find the mixed chimera state for properly chosen initial conditions where we can observe the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized oscillations namely the mixed chimera state , while synchronized oscillator from both the populations do share a common frequency .",
