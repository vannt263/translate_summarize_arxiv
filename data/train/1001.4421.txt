    "dirac operators play a central role in relativistic quantum dynamics , from the early work of dirac and the exact solutions for the hydrogen atom to later work including quantum chromodynamics and the dirac oscillator @xcite .",
    "based on early work of wallace @xcite , there has been much recent work centered around the fact that the mean field theory of grapene is well represented by the free dirac equation near the edges of the first brillouin zone , at the center of the band with so - called dirac points around which linear dispersion relations hold @xcite .",
    "simulations of this kind of situation are ongoing at various labs using hexagonal and occasionally triangular arrays in single particle problems or classical waves , including acoustics @xcite , microwaves and photonic crystals @xcite as well as true quantum simulations in nanostructures @xcite .",
    "we wish to recall , that any lattice with coordination number three will yield points with approximate linear dispersion relations similar to dirac points , but we need a tight bindig situation to guarantee isotropic cones and a hexagonal structure to introduce an additional discrete degree of freedom for the small and large component of the effective spinor .",
    "this becomes very transparent as we note , that using a hexagonal structure made up of two different triangular structures , we obtain a finite gap in the spectrum , i.e a dirac equation for a massive particle , a situation that would correspond to a b - n ( boron nitride ) lattice .",
    "in this paper we will adress the task , to find similar analoga for dirac operators , that describe situations other than the free particle .",
    "formally we shall assume arrays of potential wells , that can hold exactly one bound state .",
    "in between the wells these states decay exponentially .",
    "as the overlap of functions of two wells describes the coupling , this implies to a good approximation a tight binding system . in this framework in principle one and two - dimensional dirac type problems can be formulated , and in some cases exactly solved .",
    "we shall here focus on the dirac oscillator as introduced by marcos moshinsky ; this system is frequently used @xcite , and is particularly simple to implement .",
    "other solvable problems , such as gyroscopes @xcite and the coulomb problem as well as systems with random potentials will be touched upon in the conclusions .",
    "in particular , the one and two dimensional dirac oscillators have been considered recently in the context of both relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum optics @xcite .",
    "their importance as paradigmatic integrable models is well established and their realization in the context of tight binding models is desirable .",
    "we want to stress that the dimensionality in our examples plays a crucial role in their algebraic properties and spectra .",
    "as we shall see , the exceptional infinite degeneracy of the two dimensional dirac oscillator ( as opposed to the finite degeneracy in one dimension ) is intimately related to its specific realization on the lattices described above .",
    "it is therefore interesting to consider both dimensionalities , as they exhibit clear differences .",
    "it remains as an open question , whether three dimensional relativistic wave equations can be emulated on a three dimensional lattice .",
    "the description of such systems will depend on a massive distortion of the hexagonal lattice .",
    "this causes probably prohibitive obstacles to any implementation in terms of mean fields of graphene related structures . for recent theoretical work dealing with deformations on carbon sheets",
    "see @xcite . for classical wave models on the other hand",
    "such distortions can be implemented and we shall discuss specifically how this is done in what we usually call a microwave billiard . in two dimensions such systems yield scalar wave equations , and can readily be interpreted as single particle quantum systems @xcite .",
    "microwave billiards have been used to simulate a wide variety of phenomena including quantum chaos @xcite , scattering from open billiards @xcite , transport phenomena @xcite , fidelity decay @xcite and disordered systems @xcite , as well as recent work on dirac points @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this wide range of success combined with recent experiments with arrays of small dielectric micro wave resonators gives us good reason to hope for interesting results in orderd structures such as the ones we need .",
    "the evanescence of the cavity modes , that we intend to use , guarantees exponential decay and thus tight binding situations can be emulated .    in the next section",
    "we study a one dimensional crystal ; this will serve us to fix notation and basic ideas in a simpler context , that is not without relevance in itself .",
    "this toy model reveals dirac - like hamiltonians in both periodic and deformed structures . in section 3",
    "we analyze and reproduce similar results for the two dimensional case with and without deformations .",
    "we also consider corrections to nearest neighbour interactions and obtain the form of energy surfaces beyond tight binding . in section 4",
    "we make contact with experimental applications of our treatment by considering arrays of resonators in microwave cavities .",
    "the applicability of the tight binding model in this context is discussed . finally , we draw some conclusions and give an outlook on a selection of other dirac systems , that can be emulated .",
    "useful results are included in the appendix .",
    "in this section we start out with two lattices .",
    "first , we consider the schroedinger equation with square wells supporting a single bound state , located in a periodic one dimensional array . here , traditional aspects of the existing theory ( bloch waves ) are reviewed under an algebraic approach .",
    "the specific form of the localized wave functions is ignored , as it results to be irrelevant .",
    "an analogy between degeneracy points of the spectrum and a one dimensional dirac point is revealed in this toy model . near these points",
    "we shall cover a one - dimensional dirac equation .",
    "once this is achieved , we proceed to deform the lattice from its periodic configuration by forcing a specific operator algebra , namely the one corresponding to harmonic oscillator ladder operators . as an outcome",
    ", a one dimensional dirac oscillator shall be realized .",
    "we start by fixing some notation . in the following ,",
    "we adopt natural units @xmath0 .",
    "a lattice consisting of two periodic sublattices is considered .",
    "let @xmath1 be the distance between neighbouring potential wells .",
    "they have the same period and are denoted as type a and type b. each sublattice point can be labeled by an integer @xmath2 according to its position on the line , @xmath3 for type a and @xmath4 for type b ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the energy of the single level to be considered in the well is denoted by @xmath5 and @xmath6 for type a and b respectively .",
    "the state corresponding to a particle at site @xmath2 of lattice a is denoted by @xmath7 and the corresponding localized wave function is given by @xmath8 .",
    "for lattice b we define the wavefunction @xmath9 .",
    "our hamiltonian is well approximated by a tight binding model if the overlap between localized wave functions can be neglected and the nearest neighbour coupling matrix element @xmath10 is taken as the first off - diagonal element of the hamiltonian in the localized basis .",
    "for convenience we have split the lattice into two sublattices and we write the hamiltonian in the form    h= (    cc h_aa & h_ab + h_ba & h_bb    ) [ 1 ] rather than in the usual tridiagonal form .",
    "the entries of each block are given by @xmath11 with @xmath12 integers .",
    "thus , each block extends from @xmath13 to @xmath14 .",
    "in this basis we write the hamiltonian as    h= (    cc    cccc & & & + & & & + & & & + & & &    &    cccc & & & + & & & + & & & + & & &     +    cccc & & & + & & & + & & & + & & &    &    cccc & & & + & & & + & & & + & & &    ) [ 2 ] where the elements outside the indicated diagonals are all zero . expression ( [ 2 ] ) can be cast in terms of pauli matrices @xmath15 by defining @xmath16 and setting @xmath17 .",
    "we have    h= e_0 + _ 3 m + _ + + _ - ^ [ 4 ] displaying explicitly the dirac - like structure of the hamiltonian . to ensure the analogy between the dirac hamiltonian and ( [ 4 ] ) , we consider the spectrum of @xmath18 .",
    "we note that @xmath19 has the remarkable properties    = 0 , ^ = ( + ^ ) . [ 5 ] from these relations we may compute the spectrum by squaring @xmath18    ( h - e_0)^2 = m^2 + ^. [ 6 ] note that bloch s theorem manifests itself in the spectrum and eigenfunctions of @xmath20 as    _ k = ( 1+e^i2k ) _ k , ^ _ k = ^2 |1+e^i2k|^2 _ k [ 7 ] with    _ k = _",
    "n=-^ e^i2k n |n = (    c + e^i2k n + e^i2k ( n+1 ) +    ) . [ 8 ] therefore energies and eigenfunctions of @xmath18 are given by    e(k ) = e_0 , ^ = n (    c _ k + _ k    ) , [ 9 ] where @xmath21 is a normalization constant .",
    "when @xmath22 when the sites a and b are equal , we can find conical points of the form @xmath23 .",
    "expanding around these points we find the usual expressions for the relativistic energies of dirac particles with momentum @xmath24 , effective speed of light @xmath10 :    e()= e_0 .",
    "[ 10 ] this is valid also for non - zero rest energy @xmath25 in the case of different lattices .",
    "then we find a gap in the spectrum .",
    "the eigenfunctions satisfy the dirac equation in momentum space    ( e - e_0 ) ^ ( ) = [ _ 1 + _ 3 m ] ^ ( ) . [",
    "11 ] in the next subsection we shall proceed to show that we can obtain the dirac oscillator by deforming the double lattice .      using the notation of the previous section ,",
    "we modify the energy operator by deforming the lattice of potential wells .",
    "this implies abandoning the periodic structure and leads to a site dependence of the couplings in the corresponding tight binding model .",
    "we denote by @xmath26 the coupling between sites at @xmath4 and @xmath27 , while @xmath28 denotes the coupling between sites @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "these couplings are approximately proportional to the overlap between neighbouring sites .",
    "they decay exponentially as a function of the separation distance between the potential wells ,    _ n , n+1 = e^-d_n / , _ n ,",
    "n = e^-d_n / [ 12 ] where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the deviations from the periodic configuration , @xmath31 , @xmath32 . when @xmath33 , the periodic configuration is recovered ( see figure ) .",
    "the length @xmath34 is the penetration depth into the classically forbidden region for the wave function of the single well .",
    "we expect a modification of the operators @xmath35 caused by the change in the position of the wells .",
    "one should keep in mind that such deformations have the effect of breaking the periodic symmetry of the system and bloch wave functions cease to be useful . however , if one finds an exactly solvable model for a deformation which is continuously connected to the periodic configuration , then the corresponding solutions could be considered to constitute a generalization of bloch s waves .",
    "the algebraic properties of observables in hamiltonians have a clear connection with integrability and exact solvability .",
    "therefore , the simplest way to extend our hamiltonian is by replacing the operators @xmath36 by @xmath37 , such that their algebraic properties are those of known solvable systems . in particular , we propose the harmonic oscillator algebra , since it is a paradigmatic example @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) becomes    h= e_0 + _ 3 m + _ + a + _ - a^. [ 12.1 ] we require that such extensions reduce to the periodic case in some _ free  _ limit .",
    "we propose then    a = (    cccc & & & + & _ n , n & _ n , n+1 & + & & _",

    "computing the commutator in ( [ 14 ] ) , one finds the conditions    _ n , n = , ^2_n+1,n+2- ^2_n , n+1= [ 15 ] where the second equality is a recurrence equation . the corresponding solution is    _",

    "the second condition relates the displacement between resonators @xmath29 with the corresponding couplings .    for convenience",
    "we impose a third condition , namely the inequality    d_n > d_n-1 [ 18.1 ] this condition ensures that the displacement @xmath29 increases monotonically as a function of the distance from an arbitrarily chosen origin . combining it with the second condition this implies a finite grid , which in turn leads to a finite hilbert space of dimension @xmath41 with @xmath42 $ ] .",

    "[ 19 ] in principle other non - monotonical choices of scaling @xmath29 are possible and lead to other finite or infinite arrays . for our modeling purposes finite arrays are advantageous , and in any case our hamiltonian will emulate a dirac oscillator only in the vicinity of zero energy ( energies near @xmath44 ) as we will see later .",

    "we shall consider hexagonal structures that emulate two - dimensional dirac equations and can emulate the mean field of graphene or boron - nitride near the gap at the center of the usual band .",
    "we shall use the same algebraic strategy to derive spectra and a possible extension through deformations , namely the two - dimensional dirac oscillator .",
    "let us fix the notation for this system .",
    "the honeycomb lattice is divided in two triangular sublattices , one of them generated by the set of vectors @xmath60 ( type a ) while the other sublattice is obtained by adding the vectors @xmath61 .",

    "the treatment has been successful in predicting the existence of dirac points , in compliance with the common knowledge about this system when periodic symmetry is present .",

    "the spin emerges as the probability of the electrons to be located at sites of the triangular sublattice a ( spin up ) or b ( spin down ) .",

    "linearity around degeneracy points ( which is essential to produce a dirac hamiltonian ) is a consequence of the hexagonal structure , while the existence of such degeneracy points came from the symmetry under the interchange of the two sublattices .",

    "this can be achieved in a 2d metallic cavity which supports two types of independent modes : transverse magnetic ( tm ) mode , @xmath111 , and transverse electric ( te ) mode , @xmath112 , @xmath113 lying in the plane of the cavity . for a cavity of height",
    "@xmath114 ( in the @xmath115-direction ) and for frequencies @xmath116 , the scalar field obeys the helmholtz equation @xmath117 for the top and bottom plates , it fulfills dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions , for tm and te modes respectively . for cavities with a typical horizontal extension of a tens of centimeters and a typical height of a few millimeters , the frequency range of interest lies in the domain of microwaves .",
    "such cavities constitute paradigmatic examples for a variety of phenomena in open and closed two - dimensional systems as discussed in the introduction .",
    "the experimental set - ups using chaotic microwave cavities adopt various configurations depending on the specific studies they are intended for , but the technique to feed microwaves into the cavity and to collect the signal of interest is ubiquitous .",
    "the central device is the network analyzer which performs emission and lock - in detection of microwaves from a few tens of mhz to a few tens of ghz .",
    "the cavity is linked to the network analyzer through flexible coaxial 50@xmath118-cables connected to monopolar antennas whose central conductor penetrates into the cavity . usually , several antennas are dispatched over the top and/or bottom plates . for a measurement , only one antenna at a time",
    "is used as a microwave emitter and another ( in transmission ) or the same ( in reflection ) as a receiver .",
    "the other unused antennas are terminated by 50@xmath118 loads so that all antennas behave the same way regarding the losses they imply .",
    "the measurements are given in terms of scattering coefficients which form the complex @xmath119-matrix    s= (    cc s_11 & s_12 + s_21 & s_22    ) , [ smatrix ] where @xmath120 ( resp .",
    "@xmath121 ) measures the reflection on port 1 ( resp .",
    "2 ) and @xmath122 ( resp .",
    "@xmath123 ) measures the transmission from port 2 ( resp .",
    "1 ) to port 1 ( resp .",
    "all the measurements are performed after a proper calibration to get rid of any parasitic influence of cables and connectors and even of the analyzer itself .    in a microwave cavity",
    ", a varying potential can be obtained by introducing substances of a varying permitivity @xmath124 .",
    "the wave equation then reads : @xmath125\\psi(\\v r ) = k^2\\psi(\\v r).\\ ] ] note that the effective potential @xmath126 is energy - dependent .",
    "this does not preclude the quantum - classical analogy .",
    "recently , one of us developed experiments implementing equation ( [ waveeq ] ) in a disordered microwave cavity@xcite .",
    "the physical phenomenon put under scrutiny was anderson ( or strong ) localization ( see @xcite for a recent survey of this prolific domain ) .",
    "a network analyzer rohde & schwarz zva-24 was used in a frequency range from 1ghz to 10ghz .",
    "the disordered potential was introduced through 200 dielectric cylinders ( temex - ceramics , e2000 series ) of high dielectric permitivity ( @xmath127 ) and low loss ( quality factor @xmath128 at 7ghz ) . their height",
    "fitted that of the cavity , 5 mm , and several diameters ranging from 6 mm to 8 mm were used .",
    "the disorder was numerically generated and the scatterers were precisely positioned . in this experiment",
    "the central conductor of the antennas was perpendicular to the plane of the cavity .",
    "thus , the tm polarization of the electromagnetic field was selected .",
    "@xcite@xcite .",
    "the same dielectric cylinders , used for the localization experiments , can be arranged in periodic or other ordered patterns . in the domain of optics , periodic structures in semiconductor materials",
    "are widely used to obtain particular transport properties of guided light .",
    "thanks to photonic crystals ( also called photonic band gap materials ) the technology of photons conspire to supplant the one of electrons in domains such as communication and information technologies , computing and sensing @xcite .",
    "microwave cavity experiments , which are definitely intended for more fundamental issues , bear the benefits of their versatility .",
    "they allow , for example , distortions destroying the periodicity of the potential such as the ones described in sections 2 and 3 for emulating dirac oscillators .",
    "as emphasized in section 3.2 , we have to apply the tight binding condition . in the localization experiment ,",
    "the field filled all the cavity , tm polarization being supported inside and outside the resonators . for the experiments we proposed with ordered structures , the requirements are quite different . in order to transmit the energy efficiently into the cylinders , we use in - plane antennas , and consequently te polarization . due to the wavelength reduction by a factor @xmath129 inside the dielectric material , te modes can be excited into the scatterers above 5ghz , while 30ghz is required in air between the resonators . in the proposed frequency range",
    ", resonators support modes which decay evanescently in the surrounding space .",
    "this implies exponential decay outside the resonators . for a dielectric cylinder of 8 mm in diameter ,",
    "the first te mode appears at 6.66ghz .",
    "we experimentally checked that this mode is isotropic : @xmath130 , thus enabling isotropic coupling between resonators .",
    "we studied the range of the coupling and its spatial dependence .",
    "measurements were done with 2 and 3 resonators equally spaced on a line , and 6 resonators placed at the vertices of a hexagon ( a benzene - like structure ) . for all configurations , we observed an exponentially decreasing coupling with a characteristic length of @xmath131m@xmath132 .",
    "the 3-cylinder and benzene measurements clearly established that the second - neighbor coupling is negligible for distances between the centers of the scatterers above 10 mm .",
    "this gives a large range of the coupling constant for which the tight - binding model is fulfilled .",
    "all these experimental results will be published in a forthcoming paper focused on transport properties in graphene - like structures@xcite .",
    "we have thus established that we can meet the conditions for the emulation of the dirac oscillator and related problems can be met with arrays of dielectric microwave oscillators between two condcuting plates .",
    "these conditions will also allow to emulate other dirac operators corresponding to gyroscopes , disordered systems , etc .",
    "note though that it will be difficult to emulate a dirac hydrogen atom as the distances between resonators should become extremely small , causing conflict with the diameter of the discs .",
    "we have proposed that a wide class of relativistic equations of the dirac type can be implemented by arrays of potential wells .",
    "such quantum systems can be well approximated by tight binding hamiltonians if sufficiently fast exponential decay of the wave functions in the classically prohibited region is ensured .",
    "this idea was especifically implemented for the dirac oscillator .",
    "furthermore we have shown that we can implement such a situation experimentally with arrays of dielectric resonators .",
    "the use of te modes and the conducting plates below and above of the resonators ensures at appropriate frequencies well isolated resonances in the resonators and exponential decay outside .",
    "we have thus revealed a practical way to emulate dirac - like equations for both massive and massless particles using classical wave systems .    while we presented an emulation for the dirac oscillator in one and two dimensions ,",
    "it is clear that our algebraic treatment allows other possibilities .",
    "the most promising example is the emulation of dirac gyroscopes @xcite as the number of states in this case is finite to begin with due to conservation of total angular momentum .",
    "this forces its realization on finite grids without approximations in that respect .",
    "the relativistic hydrogen atom , on the other hand presents obvious difficulties regarding the steep potential needed near its singularity and the nearly flat potential at large distances requires separations too small for the radii of the resonators used .",
    "some intermediate region of rydberg states could possibly be emulated . leaving the realm of integrable systems",
    ", it might be interesting to introduce random small perturbations in the positions of the wells .",
    "this might mimic some properties of random matrix dirac operators @xcite .",
    "we first determine the ground state @xmath133 .",
    "we write    _ 0 = _",
    "m=0^n_max f_0(m ) |m [ 25 ] and use @xmath52 to obtain the recurrence equation    ( ) f_0(m+1 ) + f_0(m ) = 0 [ 26 ] with solution    f_0(m ) = ( -1)^m c_0 _ j=0^n_max - m + c_0 = ( _ m=0^n_max _ j=0^n_max - m ) ^-1/2 .",
