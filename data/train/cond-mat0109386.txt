    "relaxors exhibit a broad maximum in the temperature dependence of the dielectric constant and a significant frequency dependence of the temperature @xmath6 at which this maximum occurs . although these peculiarities are often referred to as a `` diffuse '' phase transition , no macroscopic phase transition into a ferroelectric state occurs at @xmath6 .",
    "of particular interest are the lead - oxide class of relaxors .",
    "this class displays extraordinary piezoelectric properties which persist over a wide temperature range , thus presenting great appeal for device applications .",
    "most of the lead - oxide relaxors are classified as b - site complex perovskite compounds , in which an average b - site valence of @xmath7 is realized by a random occupancy of two different valence cations in a fixed ratio .",
    "the prototypical lead - oxide relaxor system is pb@xmath8(mg@xmath9nb@xmath10)o@xmath11 ( pmn ) which , along with pb(zn@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 ( pzn ) , shows an enormous increase in piezoelectric character when doped with pbtio@xmath2 . in spite of a decade of research ,",
    "however , arguments over what intrinsic mechanism drives the diffuse transition remain unsettled .",
    "one of the most important concepts related to the microscopic properties of relaxors is that of the so - called `` polar nanoregions '' ( pnr ) , the first experimental evidence for which was obtained by burns and dacol.@xcite through measurements of the optic index of refraction @xmath12 on single crystal specimens of several disordered ferroelectric and relaxor compounds , including both pmn and pzn , they observed that @xmath12 deviates from a linear temperature dependence at a temperature @xmath13 ( @xmath14  k for pmn ) far above @xmath6 ( @xmath15  k at 1  khz for pmn ) .",
    "they proposed a model in which this unexpected high - temperature deviation arises from small , randomly oriented , very local regions of non - reversible polarization ( the pnr ) that begin to appear within the otherwise non - polar crystal structure below @xmath13 , which is often called the burns temperature .",
    "recent neutron inelastic scattering studies on pzn and pzn doped with 8% pbtio@xmath2 ( pzn-8%pt ) in their respective cubic phases at 500  k have shown that the lowest - energy transverse optic ( to ) phonon modes are overdamped for reduced wave vectors @xmath16 less than a characteristic wave vector @xmath17  @xmath18 , but underdamped otherwise.@xcite it is now believed that this damping is caused by the pnr because they couple strongly to the polar nature of the to modes .    , measured by naberezhnov _",
    "et al._@xcite ]    vakhrushev _ et al._@xcite carried out neutron diffraction studies on pmn and observed strong diffuse scattering which remains even at 500  k. they found that the @xmath16-width of the diffuse peak , which is inversely proportional to the correlation length , is temperature dependent , and that both the bragg and diffuse peaks exhibit history dependent effects in the field - cooled ( fc ) and zero field - cooled ( zfc ) regimes , similar to that of a typical spin glass .",
    "the transition to this glass - like state occurs around 230  k , which is slightly below @xmath6 .",
    "the diffuse scattering in pmn was subsequently measured around 16 reciprocal lattice points , from which the directions and relative magnitudes of the ionic displacements were determined.@xcite the observed diffuse scattering is broader along the direction transverse to the scattering vector @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) than it is along the longitudinal direction ( @xmath21 ) , a feature that is consistent with scattering from ferroelectric fluctuations .",
    "et al._@xcite measured both x - ray and neutron powder diffraction from pmn and reported that additional diffuse scattering appears in the tails of the bragg peaks below about 600  k. neutron powder diffraction data taken by zhao _",
    "et al._@xcite show a marked break in the linear temperature dependence of the cubic unit cell volume , also around 600  k , and is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro](a ) . more recently , naberezhnov _",
    "et al._@xcite have confirmed that the diffuse scattering indeed becomes visible below 650  k , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intro](b ) .",
    "these results strongly imply that the diffuse scattering in pmn results from the formation of the pnr at @xmath13 .",
    "naberezhnov _ et al._@xcite have also studied the lattice dynamics of pmn using neutron inelastic scattering methods between 300 and 900  k. they calculated dynamical structure factors using the room temperature diffuse scattering results of vakhrushev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , and concluded that ( 221 ) was the best zone in which to look for the ferroelectric soft mode phonon .",
    "however , they observed no underdamped soft to phonon in the vicinity of ( 221 ) even at 900  k. instead , they observed well - shaped peaks from the transverse acoustic ( ta ) and the lowest - lying to modes near ( 220 ) , although nearly no diffuse scattering was observed around ( 220 ) .",
    "they therefore concluded that the observed lowest - lying to mode could not be identified with the ferroelectric soft mode because it exhibited a structure factor that was absolutely inconsistent with that expected from the ferroelectric diffuse scattering peak intensities .",
    "however , a recent neutron inelastic scattering study by gehring _",
    "et al._@xcite has unambiguously shown that the lowest - energy zone center to mode does soften significantly on cooling from 1100  k to @xmath13 , below which it becomes overdamped , and that the relative phonon intensities measured in different zones are very similar to those found in pbtio@xmath2 , a prototypical ( displacive ) ferroelectric system .",
    "it is thus clear that an important discrepancy exists between the relative intensities of the soft to mode and those of the diffuse scattering in pmn .",
    "since each is related to either dynamic or static atomic displacements toward the same ferroelectric state , the relative intensities should be consistent .",
    "the aim of this paper is to determine how the diffuse scattering in pmn connects to the soft to mode , and thereby resolve this discrepancy . to study the diffuse scattering in pmn in detail ,",
    "we have carried out neutron diffraction measurements from 200 to 700  k. we have concentrated on the diffuse scattering around the three bragg reflections ( 101 ) , ( 200 ) , and ( 300 ) , and measured the @xmath16-profiles and the temperature dependence .",
    "these results , as well as the experimental conditions , are summarized in section  [ diffuse ] . in section  [ phonon ]",
    "we describe our phonon structure factor calculations using the atomic displacements determined from the diffuse scattering intensities , which helps to clarify the inconsistency between the relative intensities of the soft to mode and of the diffuse scattering .",
    "we believe this discrepancy can only be resolved if one assumes the simple model in which the pnr are shifted along their polar direction relative to the surrounding cubic matrix .",
    "finally , we compare our experimental results with those from previous neutron and x - ray scattering studies , and discuss one possible origin of this new concept , which we call a `` phase - shifted condensed soft mode , '' in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the neutron diffuse scattering data presented here were obtained on the bt9 triple - axis spectrometer located at the nist center for neutron research .",
    "the data were taken with fixed incident neutron energy @xmath22  mev ( @xmath23   ) , and with horizontal beam collimations 40@xmath24 - 46@xmath24-s-40@xmath24 - 80@xmath24 or 40@xmath24 - 10@xmath24-s-10@xmath24 - 80@xmath24 ( `` s '' = sample ) .",

    "the crystal exhibits three naturally grown @xmath26 facets , and was mounted on a boron nitride post using tantalum wire with one of the facets facing vertically , and then attached to the cold - head of a high - temperature closed - cycle helium refrigerator .",

    "( [ eq : delta - com ] ) without the phase shift , which satisfies the center of mass condition and gives the same relative intensities for both the diffuse scattering and the soft to mode .",
    "however , once all the atoms undergo an additional shift along the same direction by the same amount @xmath80 , the center of mass condition is no longer satisfied , resulting in the _ accidental _ disappearance of the ( 200 ) diffuse neutron scattering intensity .",
    "figure  [ fig : lattice](c ) , which depicts a uniform shift of @xmath81 , is shown just for comparison .",
    "in the preceding sections we have demonstrated how the inconsistency between the diffuse scattering and the soft to mode intensities is explained naturally within the framework of a `` phase - shifted condensed soft mode . '' our data on the diffuse scattering cross - sections in three different brillouin zones along with our measurements of the soft to mode phonons in two different zones serve as a confirmation of the detailed measurements already published by other groups . @xcite but while our data are in agreement , our interpretations differ entirely .",
    "the simplicity of our model argues in its favor .",
    "other than the standard picture of condensed local ferroelectric fluctuations created by a soft phonon , there is only one added feature , that being a uniform phase shift of the pnr relative to the surrounding cubic matrix .",
    "we believe the simpler solution is the correct one .",
    "the process of separating the observed atomic displacements into optic mode displacements @xmath4 and a single phase shift parameter @xmath5 is straightforward and unique , and requires no adjustable parameters .",
    "we realized this fact a long time ago .",
    "we did not recognized , however , the significance of the derived center of mass structure . only recently , when the true soft mode of pmn was observed directly by neutron scattering at high temperature,@xcite did we recognize the identity of the diffuse structure as a condensed soft mode .",
    "then the idea of the phase shift followed naturally .",
    "but one important question still remains : _",
    "what is the microscopic origin of this phase shift ?",
    "_ it should be emphasized that the direction of the phase shift is not arbitrary as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : lattice ] .",
    "our model requires that the phase shift be parallel , not antiparallel , to the polarization resulting from the atomic displacement . under zero external electric field , as is the case here , the polarization direction of a single pnr can be parallel to any symmetric direction of @xmath82 , i.e. , @xmath83 $ ] , @xmath84$],@xmath85 , @xmath86$].@xcite therefore , the phase - shifted directions of the pnr are microscopically aligned to their polarizations , although they appear macroscopically random .",
    "then , _ why is the phase shift of the pnr parallel to their polarization ? _    we speculate that microscopic inhomogeneities in the site - occupancy of the mg@xmath8 and nb@xmath87 cations produce a local electric field gradient that determines the direction of polarization of the pnr . in other words ,",
    "a nanoregion exposed to a local field gradient becomes a _ polar _ nanoregion with a polarization parallel to the gradient .",
    "once a pnr is formed , its polarization starts to interact with the local field gradient , and may result in shifting the pnr in order to compensate for the coulomb interaction with the lattice distortion due to the phase shift .",
    "the phase shift in this case is parallel to the local field gradient , and thus to the polarization of the pnr .",
    "since the microscopic inhomogeneities associated with the spatial distribution of the mg@xmath8 and nb@xmath87 cations causes random charged domains , the local field gradient is random .",
    "therefore , the polarizations of the pnr should also be random",
    ". however , as explained above , the phase shift of a particular pnr is always parallel to its polarization .",
    "these descriptions are still qualitative , and need to be tested experimentally .",
    "it is particularly important to study the microscopic properties of the pnr , such as their correlation lengths and textures as a function of temperature as well as electric field . we also need to understand the chemical inhomogeneity of mg@xmath8 and nb@xmath87 microscopically .",
    "finally , our model should help to resolve some of the conflicting x - ray diffuse scattering interpretations .",
    "@xcite the diffuse intensity around ( 200 ) is only accidentally zero when measured with neutrons , but it should be non - zero when measured with x - rays because of the differences between the neutron nuclear scattering lengths and the x - ray atomic scattering factors .    in summary , we have studied the diffuse scattering of the relaxor pb(mg@xmath0nb@xmath1)o@xmath2 over a wide temperature range with neutron scattering techniques .",
