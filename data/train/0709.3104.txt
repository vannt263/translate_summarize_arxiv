    "<S> a simple and accurate method of calculating phonon spectra in mixed semiconductors alloys , on the basis of preliminarily ( from first principles ) relaxed atomic structure , is proposed and tested for ( zn , be)se and ( ga , in)as solid solutions . </S>",
    "<S> the method uses an observation that the interatomic force constants , calculated _ ab initio _ for a number of microscopic configurations in the systems cited , show a clear linear variation of the main ( diagonal ) values of the interatomic force constants with the corresponding bond length . </S>",
    "<S> we formulate simple rules about how to recover the individual 3@xmath03 subblocks of the force constants matrix in their local ( bonds - related ) coordinate systems and how to transform them into a global ( crystal cell - related ) coordinate system . </S>",
    "<S> test calculations done for 64-atom supercells representing different concentrations of ( zn , be)se and ( ga , in)as show that the phonon frequencies and compositions of eigenvectors are faithfully reproduced in a linearized force constants calculation , as compared to true _ </S>",
    "<S> ab initio _ calculations .    </S>",
    "<S> calculation of phonon spectra in the harmonic approximation ( frequencies @xmath1 , eigenvectors @xmath2 ) becomes straightforward from a simple diagonalization , @xmath3 a^{\\beta}_k = 0 \\frac{d^{\\alpha\\beta}_{ik}}{\\sqrt{m_{\\alpha}m_{\\beta}}}\\right ] a^{\\beta}_k = 0 \\label{eq : dynam}\\ ] ] ( @xmath4 runs over atoms in the unit cell , @xmath5 over cartesian directions ) once the matrix of force constants , @xmath6 is known . in the adiabatic born  </S>",
    "<S> oppenheimer approximation , the forces and their derivatives over small atomic displacements can be well yielded by a density functional theory ( dft ) </S>",
    "<S> .    the calculation approaches , in their turn , are either of linear - response type ( see ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for a review ) , or of frozen - phonon @xcite or otherwise finite - displacement type  </S>",
    "<S> see , e.g. , ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all _ ab initio _ methods work reasonably well for perfect crystals and not so large supercells . </S>",
    "<S> the situation becomes more difficult if dynamic properties of alloys must be analyzed . in the present contribution , </S>",
    "<S> we deal with substitutionally disordered ii - vi and iii - v semiconductor alloys a@xmath7b@xmath8c in the absence of structural defects , so that the topological structure of cation / anion sublattices in the zincblende phase is preserved . however , chemical substitutions on either cation or anion sublattice yield considerable displacements of ions from perfect crystallographic positions . </S>",
    "<S> it is known since early 1980s @xcite that the average lattice constant in a semiconductor alloy follows vegard s law whereas individual a - c , b - c anion - cation bond lengths tend to maintain their values as in parent binary compounds . </S>",
    "<S> a complex relaxation pattern appears from an interplay of these two tendencies in each given microscopic configuration . </S>",
    "<S> the variations of bondlengths according to local environment are up to several per cent , and may give rise to well resolved raman lines . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the raman spectroscopy can serve as a tool for probing these local environments , that would ideally require a reference to model first - principle calculations , imitating different environments . </S>",
    "<S> an example of such treatment for ( zn , be)se alloys in the context of elucidating the effects of structural `` percolation '' is given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , and in the context of partial ordering tendencies in the same alloy  in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice relaxation ( which requires forces on atoms to be available in a calculation ) is by far easier than the subsequent calculation of force constants by linear response or finite - displacement method . in order to overcome this bottleneck , </S>",
    "<S> we propose in the present contribution a fast and simple way to estimate the force constants in any given atomic configuration of a pseudobinary semiconductor alloy . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is based on clear trends resulting from a number of first - principle calculations , and does not need empirical parameters to match the experimental data .    our two basic assumptions are the following : + @xmath9 ) the interatomic interactions in the force constant matrix of a semiconductor alloy can be limited by the nearest neighbours ( nn ; cation  anion ) and next - nearest neighbours ( nnn ; cation - cation and anion  anion ) terms and discarded for more distant pairs , at least for the sake of obtaining the vibration spectra with accuracy typical for the raman spectra of these crystals ; + @xmath10 ) the nn and nnn blocks of the force constants matrix can be recovered from the corresponding interatomic distances and angles . </S>",
    "<S> the actual prescription for this follows from fully _ ab initio _ ( finite - displacements ) phonon calculations done by the siesta method@xcite .     </S>",
    "<S> main elements of the force constants blocks relating nn and nnn in ( zn , be)se and ( ga , in)as alloys . </S>",
    "<S> the data are collected over a number of 64-atom supercells with different concentration . </S>",
    "<S> the nnn interactions in the ( zn , be)se system were shown in fig .  6 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . , </S>",
    "<S> scaledwidth=96.0% ]    the supercells used were a prototype `` chain+impurities '' be@xmath11zn@xmath12se@xmath13 one described in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , `` be - clustering '' supercells of the same size containing 1@xmath144 be atoms grouping around the same se atom in znse ; the same supercells constructed for ( ga , in)as system , and a number of smaller ( 32-atom ) supercells for both alloys , which were subject to discussion in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phonon densities of states ( phdos ) of species @xmath15 discussed in the following are zone - center - projected components of eigenvectors , sampled as @xmath16 ( @xmath17=0 in our case ) , and technically obtained from zone - center discrete vibration spectra @xmath18 in various supercells , artificially broadened with half - width parameter of 10 @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> the first of the above statements is verified by comparing the phdos calculated with the elements of @xmath20 set to zero beyond the second neighbours . </S>",
    "<S> the result was found , for any practical purpose , indistinguishable from that calculated with the full force constants matrix . on the contrary , </S>",
    "<S> an omission of nnn interactions leads to unacceptable damage of the phdos .    in order to understand the behaviour of nn and nnn force constants </S>",
    "<S> , we diagonalized them blockwise , for each given pair of atoms involved . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , @xmath20 and @xmath21 blocks of the global force constant matrix , both having dimension 3@xmath03 , can be cut out of the global matrix to form a ( symmetric ) 6@xmath06 block . </S>",
    "<S> its diagonalization yields antisymmetric ( three positive and three negative ) values . </S>",
    "<S> let us discuss first the diagonal elements of the force constants matrix for the nn . </S>",
    "<S> the major element comes from the central force , acting along the corresponding bond , and two minor elements from tangential forces of markedly similar size , revealing an essentially axial anisotropy of nn interaction with respect to the bond direction . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fc ] shows diagonalized force constants for ( zn , be)se alloys ( those previously shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) along with new results for ( ga , in)as . we address the reader to ref .  </S>",

    "<S> se bonds which follows from these results ; obviously there is no such strong distinction in the degree of covalence between ga  as and in  as bonds . </S>",
    "<S> what is striking for both mixed systems is a markedly linear variation of the force constant values with the bond length . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that the data shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : fc ] are collected over a number of supercells with different concentrations , hence this trend must be quite independent on the details of microscopic structure . </S>",
    "<S> we approximated this dependence by a linear function , with different coefficients for each given cation - anion pair . with the diagonal elements coming from the fit </S>",
    "<S> , one has yet to specify the local system in which the force constant matrix is reduced to its main axes . analyzing the transformation matrices ( those which yield diagonalization ) over a number of systems , </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the main axis should indeed be directed along the bond , and the orientation of two others is in fact irrelevant because of the abovementioned axial symmetry ; we arbitrarily set the second axis in the plane passing through the cation  </S>",

    "<S> , scaledwidth=80.0% ]    for nnn interactions , the orientation of the local system which diagonalizes the force constants matrix is not that straightforward . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that the main axis of cation  cation or anion  anion interaction lies in the plane which passes through these two atoms and the third one ( anion or cation , respectively ) which is bonded to the two in question ; see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nnnaxes ] . the direction of this main axis in _ not _ along the line connecting the nnn in question , but forms with it an angle @xmath22 , practically unaffected by the nnn distance , but different for different types of nnn . </S>",
    "<S> the angles @xmath22 for ( zn , be)se systems are @xmath23 ( be - be and be - zn ) , @xmath24 ( zn - zn ) , @xmath25 ( se - se ) ; for ( ga , in)as system  @xmath26 ( ga - ga ) , @xmath27 ( in - in ) , @xmath28 ( in - ga ) , @xmath29 ( as - as ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second ( in the size of the corresponding element ) main axis is also in the plane connecting three atoms and normal to the first , and the third one ( not shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : nnnaxes ] ) is normal to the plane .    </S>",
    "<S> it rests to specify the on - site @xmath30 blocks of the force constant matrix , which are clearly dominant and strongly dependent on each atom s environment in crystal . </S>",
    "<S> we recovered these blocks from the acoustic sum rule , @xmath31 assuming @xmath20=0 beyond nnn .    </S>",
    "<S> in conclusion , we test the results of the phonon spectrum calculations with the parametrized force constants , against those obtained with the `` true '' force constants from _ ab initio _ calculations for the corresponding supercells . </S>",
    "<S> the phdos shown in fig .  [ fig : phdos ] show , to our opinion , a quite satisfactory level of agreement , which is about the same for all supercells we have considered . based on this , we suggest that the present approach of `` linearized force constants '' may be useful for fast calculations of vibration spectra in large supercells .    the present contribution serves the justification and description of our approach . </S>",
    "<S> new results obtained with this method for larger supercells , along with the parametrizations for other mixed semiconductor systems we have studied , will be reported elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of computational facilities at the centre informatique national denseignement suprieur ( cines project n@xmath32pli2623 , montpellier , france ) is greatly appreciated . </S>"
