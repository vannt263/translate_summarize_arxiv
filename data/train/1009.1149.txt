    "the formation of the earliest galaxies and the cosmic reionization are among the milestones in the history of the universe .",
    "as the first stars form in the earliest non - linear structures , they illuminate the ambient intergalactic medium ( igm ) and start the reionization process of hydrogen . based on an instantaneous reionization model , the polarization data of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) constrain the redshift of reionization to be @xmath1 @xcite , while the gunn - peterson troughs @xcite shown in quasar ( qso ) absorption spectra suggest that the reionization of hydrogen was very nearly complete by @xmath2 ( e.g. @xcite ) . however , at present we are still unable to observe the earliest galaxies directly , and our current understanding on the reionization process is only based on theoretical models ( e.g. @xcite ) and simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) .    the most promising probe of the cosmic reionization is the redshifted 21 cm transition of hi which is directly related to the neutral component of the igm ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) . unlike the ly@xmath3 resonance line , the 21 cm line could hardly be saturated because of its extremely small einstein coefficient ( @xmath4 ) , so it traces well the reionization history , especially during the early stages . using the cmb as the background radio source , 21 cm tomography could map out the three dimensional structure of the emission or absorption of 21 cm photons by the igm ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , it requires the deviation of the spin temperature from the cmb temperature and may not be feasible for certain epochs ; it could not resolve structures smaller than @xmath5 ; and it has a number of observational challenges @xcite .",
    "complementary to the 21 cm tomography , the 21 cm forest observation detects absorption lines of intervening structures against high redshift radio sources @xcite , and it is immune to most of the above difficulties encountered by the tomography observation .",
    "as it is very sensitive to gas temperature @xcite , it provides a useful tool to constrain the x - ray heating in the early universe . and also , the 21 cm forest is a promising probe that could possibly detect high redshift minihalos , which are important for determining the mean clumping factor of the igm and putting limits on small scale structure formation .",
    "here we focus on the absorption experiments and investigate the 21 cm absorption lines produced by the non - linear structures during the epoch of reionization .",
    "the forest observation relies on the availability of luminous radio sources beyond the epoch of reionization .",
    "one possibility is the high redshift quasars which have been observed up to @xmath6 @xcite , and a radio - loud quasar at @xmath7 was discovered by @xcite . using high - z quasars or radio galaxies as backgrounds ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite have examined the possibility of detecting 21 cm absorption by the neutral igm based on simulations .",
    "another possible option is the radio afterglows of high-@xmath0 gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "it is believed that some of the long duration bursts are produced by the explosions of massive stars .",
    "the first stars are thought to be likely very massive , and may produce bright grbs which would be detectable up to a redshift as high as 60 @xcite .",
    "recently , grb 090423 was discovered at @xmath8 ( @xcite , while @xcite reported its redshift to be @xmath9 ) , establishing the new redshift record of observation for all objects except for the cmb .",
    "the radio afterglow of a grb can be observed out to a very late time when the outflow becomes sub - relativistic ( e.g. @xcite ) , and considering the cosmic time dilation , it offers us an adequate integration time .",
    "one possible problem with the grb radio afterglow is that at very low frequency , synchrotron self - absorption may become important which may reduce the radio flux .",
    "nonetheless , some grb radio afterglows may be sufficiently bright at the relevant frequency ranges .    in order to plan such observations ,",
    "we need to know what kind of signals will be produced by the early structures , and to understand the physics behind the expected signals . in this paper , we provide a detailed modeling of the 21 cm absorption lines produced by minihalos and dwarf galaxies during the epoch of reionization , and explore the physical origins of the line profiles .",
    "we generate synthetic spectra of both quasars and grb afterglows , on top of which the 21 cm absorption lines are superposed . projecting the capability of future instruments , we discuss the prospects of detecting the 21 cm signals from these non - linear objects in the early universe .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows . in section [ model ] , we describe the physical model involved with the 21 cm absorptions , including the halo model for high redshifts , the star burst criterion , a possible x - ray background , the physical processes taking place in minihalos and dwarf galaxies respectively , and the ly@xmath3 background produced by these early galaxies . in section",
    "[ profiles ] , we show the spin temperatures and 21 cm line profiles of minihalos and dwarf galaxies for various parameters . statistical results including line number density , theoretical spectrum , and the equivalent width ( ew ) distribution are given in section [ theospec ] .",
    "then , in section [ obsspec ] we study the feasibility of the 21 cm observation by making mock spectra of both quasar and radio afterglow of grb . finally , we summarize and discuss our results in section [ discuss ] .    throughout this paper",
    ", we adopt the cosmological parameters from wmap5 measurements combined with sn and bao data : @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "we start with a description of various aspects of physics involved with determining the absorption spectrum of 21 cm lines .",
    "this includes the high redshift number density of dark matter halos , gas distribution inside and around halos , the criterion of star formation , the x - ray and ly@xmath3 background , and a detailed modeling of the physical properties of starless minihalos and galaxies , respectively . among these properties , the ionization state , the gas temperature distribution , and the ly@xmath3 photon density",
    "are especially important for determining the strength and line profiles of the 21 cm absorption by minihalos / dwarf galaxies .      in order to model the halo number density at high redshift , we use the sheth - tormen halo mass function , which is based on an ellipsoidal model for perturbation collapse and fits well the simulation results .",
    "the comoving number density of halos at redshift @xmath0 with mass in the interval @xmath16 , can be written as @xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 \\frac{\\delta_{sc}}{\\sigma}\\ , \\exp\\left[-\\ , \\frac{a\\ , \\delta^2_{sc}}{2\\ , \\sigma^2 } \\right].\\ ] ] here @xmath19 is the cosmic mean density of the total matter today , @xmath20 is the r.m.s . of a gaussian density field smoothed on a mass scale @xmath21 with a spherical top - hat filter of radius @xmath22 , where @xmath22 is equivalent to @xmath21 in a fixed cosmology as @xmath23 , and @xmath24 is the critical overdensity required for spherical collapse at redshift @xmath0 , extrapolated to the present time using the linear theory , where @xmath25 is the linear growth factor .",
    "the correction factors @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 were introduced as appropriate for ellipsoidal collapse @xcite .",
    "the 21 cm signal depends on the gas content of minihalos or galaxies , and the gas fraction in halos will be suppressed by the heating processes during the reionization .",
    "therefore , we set the lower limit of the halo mass to be the characteristic mass @xmath29 at which halos on average could only retain half of their baryons .",
    "the characteristic mass depends on the halo merger history and the thermal evolution of the universe @xcite . at high",
    "redshift that we are considering ( @xmath30 ) , however , the filtering mass @xmath31 provides a good fit to the characteristic mass @xmath32 @xcite . including the global heating process by an x - ray background",
    "( see section [ opticaldepthwithxrb ] in the following ) , we compute the thermal evolution of the universe and find that this mass scale is @xmath33 beyond redshift 7 for an early x - ray background not higher than @xmath34 of the intensity today . for high redshifts of interest , it is not very sensitive to the uncertain intensity of the x - ray background because of the delayed response of the gas density distribution to the change in the gas temperature .",
    "however , if the early x - ray background was as high as today , or even higher , it would have moderate effect in raising the jeans mass and the filtering mass ( see the right panel of fig.[fig.tigm_xi_mfmj ] ) .",
    "so we take the halo mass range of @xmath35 $ ] for an x - ray background not higher than @xmath34 of today s value , but also consider its effect on the minimum halo mass for higher intensities of the x - ray background ( see section [ theospec ] ) .",
    "the range covers the characteristic halo mass and most of the galaxies that are responsible for the reionization @xcite .    in the following , we use the nfw density profile for dark matter distribution inside of the virial radius @xmath36 of a halo @xcite . in general , the key parameter in the nfw profile , the concentration parameter @xmath37 , depends on the halo mass as well as its redshift . unfortunately , the concentration parameter found from low redshift simulations @xcite is not directly applicable to the epoch of reionization .",
    "thanks to the resimulation technique , @xcite have simulated an example of the first halos from very high redshift with extremely high resolution , and its density profile is derived in each resimulation at the final time . here",
    "we make use of their results . assuming that @xmath37 is inversely proportional to @xmath38 , as indicated by low redshift results",
    ", we make a 4th - order polynomial fit to the simulated points in the logarithmic space of halo mass . for the distribution of gas within the dark matter halo ,",
    "we assume that the gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter , and have a spherical distribution .",
    "we expect gas in the high-@xmath0 ( and in general low - mass ) galaxies have a rounder distribution rather than settling into a disc because : ( a ) their circular velocities are comparable to the sound speed , making the gas more rounded than flat ; ( b ) at such high redshifts , there may not be enough time for the gas to settle in a smooth disk . with the nfw profile of dark matter distribution",
    ", one can derive the gas density distribution analytically @xcite : @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the central gas density , @xmath41 is the mean molecular weight of the gas depending on the ionization state , @xmath42 is the proton mass , @xmath43 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath44 is the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "here @xmath45 denotes the gas escape velocity at radius @xmath46 , which can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the circular velocity at the virial radius , @xmath49 , @xmath37 is the halo concentration , and @xmath50 .",
    "the maximum escape velocity is reached at the center of the halo , @xmath51 . in eq.([eq.rho_g ] ) , the central density @xmath40 is determined by the condition that the total baryonic mass fraction within the virial radius is equal to @xmath52 , which gives @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the mean matter density of the universe at redshift @xmath0 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 is the mean density of a virialized halo with respect to the cosmic mean value @xmath57 @xcite : @xmath58 , where @xmath59 $ ] .    to determine the gas distribution outside @xmath36 , one has to keep in mind that the gas slowly falls into the halo because of the gravitational force of the halo , so the gas has a peculiar ( i.e. infalling ) velocity which could be important for the 21 cm line .",
    "also , due to the large cross - section at large radii , there is a high probability for the line of sight to go through these external parts of the halos , and this infalling gas has to be included in the calculation .",
    "@xcite has derived a model for the expected profiles of infalling matter around virialized halos based on the extended press - schechter ( eps ) formalism @xcite .",
    "this `` infall model''barkana / codes.html . ]",
    "can also be used to compute the final peculiar velocity profiles around virialized halos as well .",
    "the total velocity of the gas is the sum of the peculiar velocity and the hubble expansion . in these infalling regions around halos",
    ", we assume that the gas overdensity and velocity field follow the dark matter perfectly , with the scaling factor @xmath60 .",
    "several illustrative curves of the total hydrogen number density profiles are shown in fig.[fig.nh ] for various halo masses and two sets of redshifts .",
    "a constant hydrogen fraction of primordial value @xmath61 is assumed here @xcite .",
    "the halos with smaller mass and lower redshift are more concentrated .",
    "we can see that there are discontinuities at @xmath36 .",
    "that is because when we adopt the gas density profile above , we are also assuming that the virilization shock is located right at the virial radius , and at the shock radius density and temperature jumps are expected .",
    "the exact position of the shock radius is subject to debate , and may depend on the assembly history of the halo .",
    "for an cosmology with @xmath62 , @xcite found that the accretion shock forms at the radius @xmath63 which encloses a mean dark matter density of 90.8 times the cosmic mean , while @xcite suggests that the shock radius is close to the virial radius .",
    "below we assume that the shock is located at the virial radius , but note that the exact position of the shock radius has only a small effect on the resulting 21 cm signal ( see the next section ) .",
    "after the formation of dark matter halos , some of the halos could form stars inside while others could not , depending mainly on the cooling processes in each halo ( see @xcite for a recent review ) . as for those halos with star formation ,",
    "a star burst is more likely than continuous formation at this early epoch , because , small objects are very sensitive to feedbacks and therefore , as soon as the first stars formed in the galaxy , their radiation and induced supernovae could heat and eject the surrounding gas , quenching subsequent star formation . in order to determine whether a halo is able to undergo a star burst , here we use a timescale criterion for star formation .",
    "if the time required for a halo to start forming stars is longer than the hubble time at the halo redshift , it will remain starless , i.e. a system that is usually identified as a _",
    "minihalo_. otherwise , the halo has enough time to cool and collapse to form stars , and becomes a _",
    "dwarf galaxy_. the timescale required for turning on a star burst is modeled as the maximum between the free - fall time @xmath64 and the cooling time @xmath65 , i.e. @xmath66 , where @xmath67 . as for the minihalos and dwarf galaxies in the early universe , the main coolant is the molecular hydrogen @xcite , and @xmath68 is the h@xmath69 cooling timescale . defining @xmath70",
    ", one can obtain @xcite @xmath71 where @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and the @xmath74 is the fraction of hydrogen in molecular form .",
    "this fraction varies with time and to get the precise value at virialization it would be necessary to follow the entire collapse history , but after the virialization the h@xmath69 fraction of a halo always saturates at @xmath75 @xcite . for simplicity , we use @xmath76 hereafter .",
    "the cooling and collapse processes start from the halo formation time , which is usually defined as the time at which a halo first acquires half of its final mass .",
    "there are several predictors for the formation redshift distribution of dark matter halos , such as the standard eps model @xcite , the ellipsoidal collapse model @xcite , and the non - spherical collapse boundary model @xcite . at high redshift ,",
    "the eps model fits the simulation results best @xcite .",
    "according to the eps model @xcite , the cumulative probability that a halo with mass @xmath77 at redshift @xmath78 has a formation time @xmath79 prior to @xmath80 or a formation redshift @xmath81 higher than @xmath82 is @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the conditional probability function : @xmath85}\\ , ds_1 \\ ; ( s_1>s_2 , \\delta_{sc1}>\\delta_{sc2}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath86 is defined as the variance of density field smoothed on a mass scale @xmath21 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 . given any halo mass at the redshift of interest ,",
    "we differentiate eq.([eq.cumupzf ] ) with respect to @xmath81 to get the differential distribution of the halo formation redshift , then its formation redshift @xmath81 is chosen by monte - carlo sampling of the distribution curve .",
    "the star burst time is simply @xmath92 .",
    "when the criterion @xmath93 is satisfied , a star burst occurs at time @xmath94 , while @xmath95 implies that the halo is not able to form stars within a hubble time .      with a high redshift grb afterglow as the background source , the neutral hydrogen in the igm absorbs the 21 cm photons along the line of sight .",
    "for the diffuse igm beyond those regions affected by the gravity of non - linear structures , it expands uniformly with the hubble flow , then the optical depth is @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the planck constant , @xmath37 is the speed of light , @xmath98 is the einstein coefficient for the spontaneous decay of the 21 cm transition , and @xmath99 is the rest frame frequency of the 21 cm transition . here",

    "several authors ( e.g. @xcite ) have shown that x - rays will likely heat the igm significantly before reionization completes . also , if it existed , it could partially ionize the igm , suppress the formation of low mass minihalos , and heat the infall regions around surviving minihalos and dwarf galaxies . however , the heating processes are quite uncertain during the early stages of reionization , and it is unknown what the x - ray intensity should be at high redshifts . here we include only the x - ray background heating which is the most important heating mechanism @xcite . calibrating the x - ray ( @xmath103 ) luminosity of high-@xmath0 objects to nearby starburst galaxies , we have @xcite @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the star formation rate , and @xmath106 is a correction factor accounting for the unknown properties of x - ray emitting sources in the early universe",
    ". we will set @xmath107 as the fiducial value as the early galaxies are probably much less productive of x - rays than the nearby starburst galaxies , but we take @xmath106 as a free parameter and vary the level of x - ray background by choosing different values of @xmath106 to illustrate the sensitivity of our results to this uncertain process . assuming that the star formation rate is proportional to the rate at which matter collapses into galaxies @xcite , the total x - ray emissivity @xmath108 can be written as : @xmath109 where @xmath110 is the total particle number density ( including hydrogen atoms , protons , electrons , and helium ) , @xmath111 is the fraction of matter in collapsed halos with @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is typically taken to be the mass threshold for atomic cooling which has a virial temperature @xmath114 , and @xmath115 is the star formation efficiency normalized to the cosmic baryon content .",

    "a fraction of energy in the x - ray background contributes to the heating of the igm , and another fraction contributes to the ionization of igm , these fractions depend on the ionizing state of the igm @xcite . in the absence of an ionizing uv background , the ionization would be caused mainly by these x - ray photons , and we take into account both the primary and the secondary ionization processes in computing this @xmath117 , assuming ionization equilibrium",

    "the spin temperature of neutral hydrogen is defined by the relative occupation numbers of the two hyperfine structure levels , and it is determined by three competing processes : ( 1 ) absorption of cmb photons ; ( 2 ) collisions with other hydrogen atoms , free electrons , and other species ; and ( 3 ) scattering with uv photons .",
    "the equilibrium spin temperature is given by @xcite : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is the cmb temperature at redshift @xmath0 , @xmath151 is the gas kinetic temperature , and @xmath152 is the effective color temperature of the uv radiation . in most cases , @xmath153 due to the frequent ly@xmath3 scattering @xcite .",
    "the collisional coupling is described by the coefficient @xmath154 , and @xmath155 is the coupling coefficient of the ly@xmath3 pumping effect known as the wouthuysen - field coupling @xcite .",
    "the main contributions to @xmath154 are h - h collisions and h-@xmath156 collisions , and it can be written as @xmath157 where @xmath158 is the equivalent temperature of the energy slitting of the 21 cm transition , and @xmath159 and @xmath160 are the de - excitation rate coefficients in collisions with free electrons and hydrogen atoms respectively .",

    "in addition to the global @xmath117 and @xmath171 , to compute the line profiles of the 21 cm absorptions by minihalos and dwarf galaxies , we need a detailed prescription of the ionization state , the temperature profile , and the ly@xmath3 photon density in and around these objects .",
    "we model respectively these properties of both minihalos and dwarf galaxies , as well as the intensity of ly@xmath3 background in the following .",
    "minihalos refer to those small halos that are not capable of hosting stars , and they represent a very numerous population according to the halo mass function . as we are considering the early stages of reionization , when the igm was slightly ionized with some rare sites illuminated by the earliest galaxies , the background radiation field has not been set up . however , the gas in minihalos , which has much higher density , could be collisionally ionized partially , depending on its temperature .",
    "the hi fraction is computed from collisional ionization equilibrium ( cie ) @xmath172 where @xmath173 is the collisional ionization coefficient @xcite , and @xmath174 is the case b recombination coefficient @xcite which is appropriate for the high - z and low - mass halos as well as the igm that are far from fully ionized .    the coefficients @xmath173 and @xmath174 are both functions of temperature . during the virialization process , the gas inside a minihalo is shock heated to the virial temperature . as for the gas outside the halo ( @xmath175 ) ,",
    "since we are looking at high redshifts when reionization is still very patchy , the igm around a minihalo might be much colder or much hotter than the gas inside the minihalo depending on its environment .",
    "in other words , either the minihalo is embedded in an almost neutral region , or it is embedded in an hii region produced by a neighboring galaxy . if we go to high enough redshifts , the probability for the halo to be in a neutral region increases . with an x - ray background , we assume that the temperature of gas around each minihalo equals to @xmath176 . the hi column density of a minihalo ( integrated from @xmath177 to @xmath178 along a line of sight passing through the halo center ) as a function of its mass is shown in fig.[fig.n_hi ] for redshift 10 . for low mass minihalos ,",
    "the hi column density increases with the halo mass , but it decreases rapidly for halo masses larger than @xmath179 , as the gas is gradually ionized in those halos with higher virial temperatures .",
    "another ingredient for the computation of 21 cm optical depth is the number density of ly@xmath3 photons , which is essential for determining the spin temperature of hydrogen .",
    "the background ly@xmath3 photons can not penetrate into minihalos and contributing to the ly@xmath3 flux inside them ( see the arguments in section [ lyabackground ] ) , and in the absence of stars , the ly@xmath3 photons could come only from recombinations in the gas itself .",
    "the ly@xmath3 production rate is @xmath180 the factor of two - thirds accounts for the probability of the recombination leading to a ly@xmath3 photon and the other one - third is the probability of obtaining photons of frequencies different from the ly@xmath3 @xcite . because of the extremely large cross - section of ly@xmath3 resonant scattering , the ly@xmath3 photons can not escape immediately from the halo , but scatter with the hydrogen atoms frequently and diffuse in the gas .",
    "this process is well described as a `` random walk '' .",
    "thus , the ly@xmath3 photons can accumulate in a given region for a diffusion time , @xmath181 , where @xmath182 is the r.m.s .",
    "distance that ly@xmath3 photons have to travel in order to escape from the region , and @xmath183 is the mean free path of the ly@xmath3 photons . for the case of minihalo @xmath184",
    "however , the ly@xmath3 accumulating time @xmath185 is also limited by the time interval between the halo formation and the hubble time , i.e. @xmath186 , then the real accumulating time of ly@xmath3 photons is @xmath187 .",
    "actually , @xmath188 is quite large , and it is always longer than the hubble time , so the ly@xmath3 photons would accumulate for a time interval @xmath189 . due to the large accumulating time , even with a low ionized fraction in the igm , the ly@xmath3 photons from recombination could also be important outside the @xmath36 as compared to the background ly@xmath3 photons .    in order to illustrate the relative effects of collisional coupling and ly@xmath3 coupling in minihalos , we plot several contours of the coefficients @xmath154 ( upper panel ) and @xmath155 ( bottom panel ) on @xmath190 planes in fig.[fig.xaxc ] .",
    "these coefficients are all calculated for the central properties of halos , and to show clearly the dependence of @xmath155 on the virial temperature of halos , we set the accumulation time of the ly@xmath3 photons to be a hubble time at each redshift .    as we see clearly from the contours",
    ", @xmath155 dominates over @xmath154 for high mass halos , in which gas is collisionally ionized and ly@xmath3 photons are effectively produced and accumulated from recombinations .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath154 dominates over @xmath155 for low mass halos which are almost completely neutral .    as for @xmath155",
    ", it has a very weak dependence on the redshift , but increases dramatically around @xmath191 due to the change of ionized fraction there . at higher temperatures , when the gas is almost collisionally ionized , the @xmath155 slowly drops again because of the decreasing @xmath174 with temperature .",
    "there are several effects taking place to determine the behavior of @xmath154 . in general",

    "therefore , @xmath193 is smaller at high temperatures when the gas is almost ionized and @xmath193 represents the total hydrogen density .",
    "this could also result in the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath154 .      as discussed in section [ sbcriterion ]",
    ", star bursts could occur in some of the halos , turning them into dwarf galaxies when the cooling process allows the gas to cool and collapse within a hubble time . depending on the initial mass function ( imf ) and star formation efficiency ,",
    "the stars produce a radiation field that will photonionize the gas creating an hii region , heat the gas around , and produce ly@xmath3 photons at the same time .",
    "all these effects could have influences on the strength and shape of the 21 cm signal of the galaxy .    the initial mass function and the emission spectrum of the first galaxies remain very uncertain ( see @xcite for a review )",
    "however , @xcite has examined spectral properties of the ionizing continua of high redshift starburst galaxies for various imfs , metallicities and star formation histories .",
    "we make use of their results for the emitting rate of h and he@xmath194 ionizing photons per solar mass of burst stars , denoted by @xmath195 and @xmath196 , as well as the average energy per photon with @xmath197 ( he@xmath194 ionizing threshold ) denoted by @xmath198 .",
    "the lyman continuum photons are divided into two parts : photons with @xmath199 could effectively result in photonionization , and those soft x - rays with @xmath200 have a large probability to escape , and serve as an extra heating mechanism in addition to the x - ray background outside the hii region . assuming a simple power law for the high energy tail of the emission spectrum , we extrapolate @xmath196 and @xmath201 to get the production rate of soft x - rays @xmath202 and their average photon energy @xmath203",

    "further , we assume all the stars to be located at the center of the galaxy , and neglect the hubble expansion during the growth of the hii region , as its growth time is much shorter than the hubble time . starting from the star burst time , @xmath213 , the evolution equation of the radius of an hii region is @xmath214 where @xmath215 is the ionizing rate , and the second term on the right - hand side accounts for recombinations in the hii region . here",
    "@xmath216 is used , as appropriate for the temperature of an ionized region .",
    "here we negelect the change in gas density profile due to the heating , as we will see later that it is quite weak .",

    "we use @xmath219 as favored by the early reionization model ( erm , @xcite ) , and a mass - dependent @xmath116 provided by the handy fit in @xcite .",

    "the ( physical ) virial radius of this galaxy is @xmath223 .",
    "since @xmath195 has a weak dependence on the metallicity but very sensitive to the imf , we fix the metallicity at z = @xmath224 , and show the growth of @xmath225 for three different imfs .",
    "these imf models are correspondingly chosen after @xcite , with a power - law slope of the salpeter value ( @xmath3 = 2.35 ) and different upper and lower mass limits : 1  100 @xmath226 ( imf - a ) , 1  500 @xmath226 ( imf - b ) , and 50  500 @xmath226 ( imf - c ) .",
    "the @xmath225 grows very fast at the beginning , but limited by the speed of light . at later stages , it is also limited by the stellar lifetime .",
    "as the stars fade away , the subsequent supernova explosions will sweep the surrounding gas away , thus suppressing the 21 cm absorption signal . for this reason we stop the evolution of the hii radius at its maximum value . as one could expect",
    ", the size of an hii region is very sensitive to the imf due to the strong dependence of lyman continuum production on stellar mass .",
    "here we are considering isolated hii regions around dwarf galaxies , but in reality the galaxies will be somewhat clustered .",
    "so the ionized regions may extend further .",
    "however , the clustering of the first galaxies is beyond the scope of this work , and we reserve this to future works .",
    "once an hii region is created , the gas inside rapidly approaches the temperature around @xmath227 @xcite .",
    "for the 21 cm absorption which requires neutral hydrogen , it is more important to compute the gas temperature outside the hii region .",

    "the solid , dashed , and dotted curves are for the three imf models used in fig.[fig.rhiievol ] . for illustration , we have assumed that the star burst occurred at the same time as the halo formation , and the temperatures are all evaluated at @xmath244 , where the most probable value for @xmath81 is used . for comparison , the temperature profile for a starless minihalo of the same mass and redshift",
    "is also shown as the dot - dashed line . inside the hii region ,",
    "the temperature is fixed at @xmath245 k , and it drops down very sharply at the ionizing front due to the lower heating rate outside , as we could expect for stellar sources . the main heating mechanism outside @xmath36 is the x - ray background heating .",
    "apart from ionizing photons and soft x - rays , the dwarf galaxy is also producing ly@xmath3 photons which are essential for determining the spin temperature of hydrogen .",
    "however , those ly@xmath3 photons directly emitted by the galaxy could hardly contribute to the coupling in the gas outside the hii region due to the extremely long diffusion time , and they will be blocked near the ionization front . it is the ly@xmath3 photons cascaded from soft x - rays that penetrate into the nearby igm and effectively couple the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature of the gas @xcite .",
    "so the contributing ly@xmath3 photons near an hii region come from recombination , the ly@xmath3 background , as well as the soft x - ray cascading . @xcite",

    "the ly@xmath3 production rate from cascading around the hii region is @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the frequency of ly@xmath3 photons .",

    "@xmath251 is the time during which the dwarf galaxy is producing x - rays , and @xmath252 is the time interval between the halo redshift and the star burst redshift . because of the large m.f.p . of the x - rays ( compared to the @xmath36 )",

    "in addition to the ly@xmath3 photons produced by recombination and those cascaded ly@xmath3 photons near galaxies , there is also a ly@xmath3 background .",
    "the ly@xmath3 background originates from the continuum photons to the blue side of the ly@xmath3 line emitted by the early galaxies , and its intensity becomes important at very high redshift @xcite . only photons with @xmath254 can be redshifted to @xmath170 , and all photons of higher frequencies will be absorbed at the ly@xmath255 or higher resonance lyman series lines .",
    "let @xmath256 be the number of photons emitted over stars lifetime per baryon in one of the halos that collapse to form stars and per unit of frequency .",
    "according to the stellar spectra we adopted from @xcite , @xmath256 is well approximated as flat near the ly@xmath3 frequency , then the intensity of the continuum ly@xmath3 background can be written as @xcite @xmath257.\\ ] ] here @xmath258 is the fiducial ly@xmath3 intensity corresponding to a photon density of one photon per hydrogen atom per log frequency , @xmath259 where @xmath260 is the number density of hydrogen .",

    "the problem of ly@xmath3 background propagating into minihalos is complicated .",
    "the situation in minihalos would be different from that in the igm because of their higher column densities of neutral hydrogen ( typically , @xmath270 ) .",
    "the ly@xmath3 scattering cross section in a region of high density consists of a doppler core with a typical width of @xmath271 centered on the ly@xmath3 frequency , and lorentzian wings outside the core .",
    "once a photon is redshifted or scattered into the `` core '' frequencies , the cross section is large and its mean free path becomes very short and is spatially confined within a small region with very long diffusion time .",
    "thus , the photons which eventually make up the ly@xmath3 background come from the blue side of the ly@xmath3 line , at the edge of the `` core '' and `` wing '' . in the case of minihalo , however , these photons would be blocked at the surface of the minihalo .",
    "the redshift across the minihalo is also too small for bluer wing photons which is not blocked at the edge of the minihalo to get redshifted into the core - wing boundary region when they arrive at the center of the halo .",
    "another possibility is to consider photons with such frequency that their optical depth through the minihalo is about 1 .",
    "such a photon would scatter once inside the halo .",
    "one scattering per photon is of course negligible for the coupling effect in itself , but the frequency of the photon would be changed after the scattering . if the frequency increases , then the photon cross section become even smaller and would escape right away , but if the photon loses energy during the collision and shifts to lower frequency , the cross section would be increased .",
    "could such a change bring the photon from the `` wing '' to the `` core '' ?",
    "the frequency @xmath272 of such a wing photon is given by @xmath273 , where @xmath274 is the column density of the minihalo from @xmath36 to its center , and @xmath275 is the scattering cross section on the ly@xmath3 damping wing .",
    "for typical thermal velocity of the h atom in the minihalo , we estimate that the change of photon frequency in one scattering @xmath276 , comparable to the size of the core . on the other hand ,",
    "the frequency distance to the line center for such a photon is @xmath277 , so @xmath278 .",
    "therefore , during one or even a few favorable scatterings the photon could not enter the core and should escape away .",
    "we conclude that with the exception of the surface , the ly@xmath3 background could not affect the spin temperatures of the minihalos .",
    "with the detailed models of gas density , velocity profile , ionization state , temperature evolution , and the intensity of both local and global ly@xmath3 photons for the minihalos and the dwarf galaxies described above , we are now ready to compute their spin temperature profiles and 21 cm optical depths . in this section ,",
    "we show our results of these detailed profiles for a variety of parameters .",
    "although it will be very challenging to resolve them with radio instruments in the near future , these analyses help us explore the physical origins of the line profiles and understand the physics behind .      [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     to produce mock spectra matching real observations , we degenerate the theoretical spectrum to a resolution of @xmath279 , add gaussian noise onto each pixel with the signal - to - noise ratio @xmath280 , and convolve it with a continuum of grb afterglow as well as a radio spectrum of quasar .",
    "two synthetic spectra are illustrated in fig.[fig.spec1khz ] with the left panel for a grb afterglow and the right panel for a quasar .",
    "we take @xmath107 for both cases .",
    "the flux density of grb afterglow is scaled to @xmath281 at @xmath282 and @xmath283 , which is achievable for the afterglow of an energetic grb produced by explosion of a massive metal - free star at high redshift , with isotropic energy of @xmath284 @xcite , and the spectral index is taken to be @xmath285 ( @xmath286 ) , which is appropriate for the synchrotron self - absorption spectrum at the frequencies of interest @xcite .",
    "the quasar flux density is scaled to @xmath287 at @xmath288 and @xmath268 , with a spectral index of @xmath289 as fitted to the radio spectrum of the powerful radio galaxy cygnus a @xcite .",

    "typically , after a bright , short - lived radio `` flare '' at early times , the subsequent evolution of the radio afterglow can be described by a slow rise to maximum , followed by several segments of power - law decays with a timescale of @xmath299 days @xcite .",
    "here we have assumed a reasonable integration time of 30 days , and find that a minimum flux density of @xmath300 is required to detect the absorption lines with the resolution of @xmath279 for the case of @xmath107 .    as seen from the continua ( dashed lines ) in fig.[fig.spec1khz ] ,",
    "the flux density of our prototype grb afterglow is more than one order of magnitude lower than this limit .",
    "note that this is already an energetic grb which is one order of magnitude brighter than normal grbs .",
    "it may be possible that there are even brighter grbs , but for most grbs it seems that the radio afterglows would be too dim for being used as background source in observations with such a high spectral resolution .",
    "if we by chance find a quasar at very high redshift during the early stages of reionization , the signals could be easily detected .",
    "especially , if one stacks together several lines to get an average profile , it will hopefully reveal the horn - like profiles we found .",
    "alternatively , we may try broadband observations with lower resolution . in this case",

    "the flux decrement can be written as @xmath305 , then the requirement of the background source is @xmath306    with the broadband observation , the major concern is that the available length of the line of sight is limited .",
    "on one hand , we wish to put the background source as far as possible in order to get enough bands to see varying @xmath301 values at different redshifts . on the other hand , as the source moves farther , it gets dimmer , lower the average signal to noise ratio , then an even broader band is required to detect the signal , thus beyond a certain distance the number of useful bands might decrease again .",
    "an optimal source redshift @xmath307 can be found to maximize the number of available bands .",
    "considering the applicability of our model , we set the lower limit of the redshift to be @xmath308 , and find that the optimal redshift for the grb is @xmath309 .",
    "this redshift depends mainly on the lower limit of the redshift we set , but of course it is also dependent somewhat on the reionization history , e.g. @xmath301 which evolves slowly with redshift .",
    "this does not depend on the observational parameters .",
    "the optimal redshift is quite encouraging given that we have already seen 2 grbs beyond @xmath310 .",

    "we find that the ly@xmath3 background and the ly@xmath3 photons from recombinations in the slightly ionized igm couple the spin temperature to the kinetic temperature outside minihalos or hii regions of dwarf galaxies , and the coupling is already strong at redshift 10 .",
    "the ly@xmath3 background photons are blocked at surfaces of halos , and the ly@xmath3 photons from recombinations are negligible inside low - mass halos , though it dominates over the collisional coupling in high - mass halos in which the gas is partially ionized by collisions . the collisions also couple the spin temperature to the gas kinetic temperature effectively at the center , but this coupling decreases and the spin temperature decreases with increasing radius .",
    "the infalling velocity of gas around the minihalos / dwarf galaxies plays a very important role in determining the profiles of the 21 cm lines , double - peaked horn - like profiles are produced for a vast range of parameters .",
    "the line profile of a dwarf galaxy also depends on the size of its hii region , and hence its radiative properties .",
    "the horn - like profile disappears for galaxies which are large , or with top - heavy imf so that the hii region expands beyond the turning point of gas velocity .",
    "the optical depth of a dwarf galaxy is lower for lines of sight penetrating through its hii region , while a sufficiently large hii region will lead to an optical depth trough rather than an absorption line .    with the line number density based on halo mass function and a physically motivated criterion for star formation",

    "this lies between our cases of @xmath337 and @xmath338 .",
    "but in our fiducial model , the gas temperature in the igm is about @xmath339 at the same redshift for @xmath107 .",

    "in addition to the early x - ray background , an obvious uncertainty in our model is the production of soft x - rays by dwarf galaxies in the early universe . especially with the normal imf model - a and relatively high metallicity , the amount of soft x - rays emitted after a star burst is very uncertain @xcite .",

    "we have also assumed a smooth gas density distribution , neglecting cool dense gas clumps from which the first stars are likely to form .",
    "thus we may have overestimated @xmath225 , and the optical depth could be slightly higher if they are accounted for .",
    "however , the gas fraction in minihalos or dwarf galaxies could also be lower than the cosmic mean value @xcite , then the optical depth will be lower . also , the results depend on the assumption of @xmath218 , which is taken to be 0.07 , in agreement with current observations .    as illustrated in fig.[fig.depth_a ] and",
    "fig.[fig.depth_zm ] , minihalos and dwarf galaxies exhibit distinct optical depth profiles mainly due to the different ionization state and coupling physics , so they are potentially distinguishable .",
    "although we may not be able to resolve the line profiles with the upcoming and planned instruments , it is encouraging to be able to distinguish their features in a statistical way , given that dwarf galaxies span a different halo population from minihalos which can not host stars .",

    "<S> we investigate the 21 cm absorption lines produced by non - linear structures during the early stage of reionization , i.e. the starless minihalos and the dwarf galaxies . after a detailed modelling of their properties , with particular attention to the coupling physics </S>",
    "<S> , we determine their 21 cm absorption line profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the infalling gas velocity around minihalos / dwarf galaxies strongly affects the line shape , and with the low spin temperatures outside the virial radii of the systems , gives rise to horn - like line profiles . </S>",
    "<S> the optical depth of a dwarf galaxy is reduced for lines of sight penetrating through its hii region , and especially , a large hii region created by a dwarf galaxy with higher stellar mass and/or a top - heavy initial mass function results in an optical depth trough rather than an absorption line . </S>",
    "<S> we compute synthetic spectra of 21 cm forest for both high redshift quasars and radio afterglows of gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> even with the planned ska , radio afterglows of most if not all grbs would still be too dim to be the background sources for high resolution ( 1 khz ) observations , but absorption lines can be easily detected towards a high-@xmath0 quasar . </S>",
    "<S> broadband observation against grb afterglows can also be used to reveal the evolving 21 cm signal from both minihalos and dwarf galaxies if there was no x - ray background or it was extremely weak , but it becomes difficult if an early x - ray background existed . hence the 21 cm absorption could be a powerful probe of the presence / intensity of the x - ray background and the thermal history of the early universe .    </S>",
