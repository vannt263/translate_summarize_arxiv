    "the giant molecular cloud sgr  b2 , located at the projected distance of @xmath3100 pc from the galactic center ( gc ) , is one of the richest star forming regions ( sfrs ) in our galaxy . due to its proximity to the gc ,",
    "sgr  b2 is heavily obscured in the optical , even near infrared ( nir ) and soft x - ray bands .",
    "accordingly , the star formation activity has been traced mainly with the radio and mid  far infrared ( mir and fir ) bands .",
    "the vla continuum observations have revealed at least 12 separate hii regions in the sgr  b2 cloud ( benson & johnston 1984 ) , which are grouped into three main concentrations , sgr  b2  north ( hii region k ) , main ( hii regions a ",
    "g , i , and j ) and south ( hii region h ) .",
    "the follow - up high - resolution continuum observations have revealed nearly 60 ultra compact ( uc ) hii regions lying along the north - to - south elongation ( gaume et  al .",

    "the ages of sgr  b2  ( n ) and sgr  b2  ( m ) are estimated to be @xmath8 years , using the photon flux of the exciting stars and the ambient gas density ( de pree et  al .",

    "the hard x - rays can penetrate through the large galactic @xmath4 to sgr  b2 , hence may provide a new view on the star formation activity in this cloud .",
    "this paper reports on the first @xmath11 results of hard x - ray sources and studies the x - ray population in sgr  b2 .    throughout this paper ,",
    "the distance to sgr  b2 is assumed to be 8.5 kpc , the same as to sgr  a@xmath12 , and is similar to the estimated distance of 7.1 @xmath13 1.5  kpc @xcite .",

    "tycho-2 _ sources have accuracy of 60  mas @xcite , hence the _ chandra _ frame is fine - tuned using these four sources within an absolute error of 0.25 arcsec ( 1  sigma dispersion ) . in order to search the sgr  b2 cloud member sources",
    ", we run the program of _ wavdetect _ in the 210  kev band , because x - ray photons below 2  kev are totally absorbed by the interstellar gas to sgr  b2 of @xmath20 ( sakano 2000 ) .",

    "16 , on the other hand , lies in a local diffuse minimum , hence the background is taken from an annulus around the source .    to eliminate obvious foreground or background sources ,",
    "the background - subtracted spectra are fitted with a model either power - law of fixed photon indices 2.0 , or 1-kev thin thermal plasma of solar - abundances ; the former is representative to background agns and the latter is for foreground stars .",
    "the interstellar @xmath4 to sgr b2 is @xmath30  h  @xmath31 ( sakano 2000 ) , while that of intra - sgr b2 cloud is @xmath32  h  @xmath31 ( lis & goldsmith 1989 ) . thus the sources well outside the ( 110)@xmath33  h  @xmath31 range should be regarded as either background agns or foreground stars .",
    "2 and 5 show the @xmath4 of @xmath34 1 @xmath33  h  @xmath31 within the error , hence are regarded as foreground stars .",
    "the others are likely located in the cloud ( hereafter , the cloud members ) .",
    "since the statistics of individual cloud member is limited ( 680 photons , see table 2 ) , we group them into two classes ; class  a comprises no .",
    "1013 , which are associated with the hii regions , and the class  b sources have neither radio nor ir counterpart ( no .  1 , 3 , 4 , 69 , and 1417 ) .",
    "we then make the composite spectra for the class  a and b sources ( figure  [ fig;tashi ] ) separately , and examine the average properties .",
    "the composite spectra are nicely fitted with a thin thermal plasma of solar - abundances .",
    "however , an excess near at 6.4  kev is found , hence we add a narrow line at 6.4 kev , which represents the k - shell transition of neutral or low - ionization irons .",

    "10 shows the strong iron lines ( see figure  4 ) and the total flux is reasonably high ( 51 counts ) , we allow the temperature ( @xmath36 ) , absorption column density ( @xmath37 ) , abundance ( @xmath38 ) , and equivalent width ( @xmath39 ) of the 6.4-kev line to be free . for comparison",
    ", we also use the same free parameters for no .  13 . for the other sources , we refer the best - fit parameters of the composite spectra with free parameters depending on the flux ; those with flux between 2950 counts ( no .",
    "8 and 11 ) , free parameter is @xmath4 ; and the faintest sources less than 21 counts , we fix all the parameters to those of the composite spectra and estimate the luminosity ( @xmath40 ) only .",
    "the best - fit thin thermal plasma model parameters are listed in table  2 , while the spectra and the best - fit models of the two brightest sources , no .  10 and 13 ,",
    "are shown in figure  [ fig;mainspec ] .",
    "since the 6.4-kev line feature in addition to the 6.7-kev line may be sensitive to the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) , we examine the cti correction issue using the software described by the method of townsley  et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in order to achieve the best statistics , we use the diffuse emission from all the @xmath26 region which includes the strong 6.4-kev line in sgr  b2 ( murakami et al .",
    "the standard level  2 process gives the center energy of @xmath41  kev , flux of @xmath42 , and width of @xmath43  ev , which are essentially the same as those by the method of townsley  et  al .",
    "( 2001 ) ( see table  2 in murakami  et  al .",
    "thus we conclude that the level 2 process correct the cti reasonably well , at least for the present data set .",
    "the 6.4-kev line flux is also sensitive to the background subtraction , because the background itself is a luminous 6.4-kev line source .",
    "we therefore re - subtract the background taken from the right half region of sgr b2 , where the 6.4-kev line is about two times larger than the average .",
    "still we obtain consistent results .",
    "thus the 6.4- and 6.7-kev iron lines are not artifacts due to cti nor background subtraction .",

    ", we find 11 class  b sources . the lowest flux of those sources is estimated to be @xmath61 after removing the absorption of @xmath62 , the mean value of the class  b sources .",
    "the expected number of extra galactic sources above the flux of @xmath63 is only @xmath64 in the sgr b2 region of @xmath65 ( mushotzky et  al .",
    "if we fit the composite class b spectrum with a power - law model , the photon index is found to be @xmath66 , which is out side of the typical value for agns ( 1.52.0 ) .",
    "the average @xmath4 of @xmath67  h  @xmath31 also supports that most of the class  b sources are not background agns , but are the cloud members .",
    "the temperature of @xmath68  kev ( see table  1 ) , and each x - ray luminosity of a few times @xmath69  erg  s@xmath2 are consistent with those of class  a sources , hence support that the class  b source is either a single or cluster of yso(s ) with various mass ranges .",
    "the time variable sources is likely a single star , either a high - mass or a low - mass in the high end of the luminosity function .",
    "a problem of the yso scenario is that no hii region , maser source , nor outflow has been found .",
    "furthermore , the star forming regions and high density regions elongate north to south in sgr  b2 ( e.g. , sato et  al .",
    "2000 ) , while the class  b sources are widely distributed over the whole sgr b2 cloud .",
    "this leads us to an alternative scenario that isolated white dwarfs ( wds ) are powered by the bondi - hoyle accretion ( bondi & hoyle 1944 ) from the dense cloud gas .",
    "in fact , the observed thin thermal plasma with the mean temperature of @xmath70 kev is consistent with those of accretion powered wds ( e.g. , ezuka & ishida 1999 and references there in ) .",
    "the bond - hoyle accretion rate is given by ; @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the mass and traveling velocity of wds relative to cloud , and @xmath74 is the number density of molecular hydrogen in the cloud .",
    "the mean @xmath74 can be estimated to be @xmath9 @xmath75 , from the @xmath37 value of @xmath76 h  @xmath31 and typical depth of the cloud of about 20 pc ( lis & goldsmith 1989 ) . the x - ray luminosity is given by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the radius of the wd and @xmath79 is the gravitational constant .",
    "assuming the standard mass to radius relation of wds ( @xmath80 ) , @xmath40 is estimated @xmath81 where , @xmath82 is the typical mass of wds ( ramsay 2000 and references there in ) .",
    "accordingly , with a reasonable range of gas density and wd parameters , the predicted x - ray luminosity is consistent with that of the observations .",
    "the number density of wds in the solar neighbor is ( 56)@xmath83 pc@xmath84 ( holberg , oswalt , & sion 2001 ) .",
    "since the number density of stars near the sgr b2 region ( 100  pc from the gc ) is more than @xmath85 times higher than that the solar neighbor ( e.g. , oort 1977 ) , the population of wds in our observed area ( assuming a rectangle of 7.2 @xmath86 8.4 @xmath86 20  pc@xmath87 ) can be estimated to be @xmath88  600 .",
    "therefore it is conceivable that the class  b sources are a part of isolated wds , which may lie in the higher end of the luminosity function .",
    "the composite spectra of all the cloud members has a 6.4-kev line with the @xmath39 of 200230 ev .",
    "the line energy corresponds to the k - shell emission from neutral or low - ionized irons , hence the most plausible origin is fluorescence from cold irons in the cloud gas . assuming that homogeneous circumstellar gas is irradiated by a central x - ray sources ,",
    "the required column density to emit observed 6.4 kev line is estimated from the relation of , @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the iron abundance relative to solar ( inoue 1985 ) .",
    "most of the source photons ( except for no .",
    "11 ) are extracted from a circle with a @xmath27hpd - diameter , which corresponds @xmath91 in radius .",
    "thus the number density of atomic hydrogen ( @xmath92 ) in the source regions must be 6@xmath93 , assuming @xmath90 is 1 .",
    "this estimated value exceeds the average @xmath74 in the sgr  b2 cloud of @xmath94 ( see previous subsection ) .",
    "we further find that the @xmath39 does not decrease as we reduce the radius of the photon extraction circles .",
    "therefore the gas density should be concentrated very close to the x - ray sources .",
    "in fact , de pree et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) suggested that the density ( @xmath74 ) in the close vicinity ( @xmath95  pc ) of the uc hii region in sgr  b2  ( m ) is in between @xmath96 and @xmath97 , if they are in pressure equilibrium .",

    "the x - ray sources in a dense cloud cores such as sgr  b2  ( m ) , ( n ) , and ( s ) , may photo - ionize the core regions . using the x - ray ionization rate by lorenzani & palla ( 2001 )",
    ", we estimate that a dense core of @xmath100 is largely ionized within @xmath101  pc in radius from a central source of 10-kev plasma with the luminosity of @xmath102 . for sgr b2 ( m ) , which may contains @xmath103 x - ray sources in a @xmath3 0.15-pc radius ,",
    "the ionized volume is @xmath104% of the core .",
    "since the ionized gas strongly couples to the magnetic field , it may have a significant effect on the cloud compression for star formation .",
    "the x - ray ionization may also have an impact on the abundance of molecules .",
    "the abundance of @xmath105 , for example , drops very rapidly with increasing ionization .",
    "the @xmath105 abundance in sgr  b2  ( m ) is 20 times less than that of sgr  b2  ( n ) ( de  vicente et al .",
    "since sgr  b2  ( n ) is less x - ray active and more largely extended than sgr  b2  ( m ) , the abundance difference between these two cloud cores may be explained with the x - ray ionization effect .",
    "1 .   we discovered a dozen x - ray sources in the giant molecular cloud sagittarius  b2 ( sgr  b2 ) .",
    "judging from the large absorptions ( @xmath4 ) of ( 110)@xmath33  h  @xmath31 and log@xmath106-log@xmath107 relation for the background sources , most of these are the cloud members .",
