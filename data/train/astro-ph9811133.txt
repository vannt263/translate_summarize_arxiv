    "carbon stars are tracers of the intermediate age population in galaxies .",
    "either they are currently undergoing third dredge - up ( the cool and luminous n - type carbon stars ) , or have been enriched with carbon - rich material in a binary system when the present - day white dwarf was on the agb ( the carbon dwarfs , ch - stars .",
    "the r - stars may be the result of a coalescing binary [ mcclure 1997 ] ) .",
    "since their spectral signature is very different from oxygen - rich stars , it is relatively easy to identify carbon stars even at large distances . in sect .",
    "2 the different techniques to identify carbon stars are discussed , and in sect .",
    "3 the various surveys for carbon stars in external galaxies are summarised .",
    "the results are discussed in sect .",
    "basically three methods have been used to identify carbon stars in external galaxies : ( optical ) spectroscopy of red stars , a combination of a grating and a prism ( grism ) , and narrow - band filters .",
    "the first method was used in the `` early days '' when follow - up spectroscopy was done on red stars identified in colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "this led to the discovery of the first known carbon stars in e.g. the carina dwarf ( cannon et al . 1980 ) , or fornax ( aaronson & mould 1980 ) .",
    "both the grism and the narrow - band filter technique allow for a more systematic search for carbon stars over a larger area .",
    "the former method is predominantly used by b. westerlund , m. azzopardi , and co - workers .",
    "it aims at identifying the prominent c@xmath0 band heads at 4737 and 5165  .",
    "an illustration of this can be found in westerlund ( 1979 ) .",
    "the latter method was independently used by richer et al .",
    "( 1984 ) and aaronson et al .",
    "( 1984 , also see cook & aaronson 1989 ) .",
    "it uses standard @xmath1 and @xmath2 filters in combination with two narrow - band filters near 7800 and 8100  , which are centered on an cn - band in carbon stars , and an tio band in oxygen - rich stars , respectively . in an [ 78 - 81 ] versus @xmath3 $ ] colour - colour plot , carbon stars and late - type oxygen - rich stars clearly separate . for an illustration see cook & aaronson ( 1989 ) , or kerschbaum et al .",

    "figure  1 shows the well - known correlation between metallicity and absolute visual magnitude .",
    "the interpretation being that the more luminous galaxies are also the more massive ones that have had more gas mass available to transform into stars and enrich the interstellar medium .",
    "figure  2 shows the number of carbon stars in a galaxy versus @xmath4 represented in two ways .",
    "first , the total number of c - stars in a galaxy was estimated by multiplying the known number by the ratio of total surface area of a galaxy to the survey area . as for some galaxies",
    "the survey area is less than a few percent , this correction factor can be quite large ( and uncertain ) . to circumvent this",
    ", the bottom panel shows the surface density of carbon stars in the particular survey .",
    "the drawback of this approach is that it does not take into account the spatial variation of the density of carbon stars within a galaxy . in neither approach",
    "did i correct for the fact that we do not see these galaxies face - on .",
    "some interesting things can be noticed . there is a clear relation between the ( estimated ) total number of c - stars and @xmath5 , and there seems to be a maximum surface density of about 200 kpc@xmath6 averaged over a galaxy . in both plots",
    "ngc 55 , 300 and 2403 are clear outliers .",
    "these are the most distant galaxies surveyed , and one might suppose that the surveys have been incomplete . for ngc 55",
    "the explanation probably lies as well in the fact that we see this galaxy almost disk - on , and so both the total number as well as the surface density have been underestimated .",
    "reddening within the galactic disk of the galaxy can also play a role . for ngc 2403",
    "the small number of carbon stars lies in the fact that the survey has been incomplete .",
    "all 4 c - stars have luminosities that are much higher than the average in galaxies for which we know the lf is more detail .",
    "the same is true for ngc 300 .",
    "a last note of caution is that i did not try to make a distinction between carbon stars on the tp - agb and lower - luminosity carbon stars .",
    "for example , the data for our galaxy represents tp - agb stars only , while on the other hand the smc is known to contain a large fraction of low - luminosity carbon stars ( see later ) .",
    "figure  3 shows the ratio of c- to late m - stars , and it confirms the well known trend ( cook et al .",
    "1986 , pritchet et al .",
    "the interpretation is that a star with a lower metallicity needs fewer thermal pulses to turn from an oxygen - rich star into a carbon star .",
    "figure  4 shows the ratio of the total estimated number of carbon stars over the visual luminosity of the galaxy ( e.g. aaronson et al .",
    "most of the galaxies scatter between a value of 3 and 4 , with a few outliers which are the same as noticed in fig .  2 .",
    "figure  5 shows the c - stars bolometric lf for the galaxies for which it could be constructed ( sect .",
    "2 ) ; for the magellanic clouds see groenewegen ( 1998 ) for details .",
    "table  2 lists the maximum , minimum and mean magnitude , as well as the spread , calculated from the rms deviation from the mean .",
    "also listed are the number of stars that went into the calculation and are plotted in fig .  5 , and the number of c - stars that are fainter than @xmath7 .",
    "the latter is an approximate borderline ( which is in fact dependent on metallicity ) between tp - agb and low - luminosity c - stars .",
    "the data show that in well populated lf , the mean @xmath8 is between 4 and 5 .",
    "it also shows that the mean in ngc 300 and ngc 2403 is much higher .",
    "unless one would invoke a large uncertainty in the distance or a burst of recent star formation , the most natural explanation lies in the incompleteness of the surveys in these distant galaxies .",
    "finally , the data shows that in the fainter galaxies the mean magnitude increases and that a fair number of c - stars are of the low - luminosity type .",
    "this is more clearly seen in fig .",
    "6 where the mean magnitude is plotted .",
    "this indicates a low star formation over the last few gyrs .    in principle",
    ", the overall carbon star lf contains information about the star - formation rate history from , say , 10 gyr ago ( the low - luminosity c - stars in binaries ) to a few - hundred myr ago ( the high luminosity tail of the lf ) . its a challenge to theoretical models to use these constraints together with other data to derive the chemical evolution- and star - formation rate history of these galaxies .    aaronson m. , mould j. , 1980 , apj 240 , 804 aaronson m. , mould j. , 1985 , apj 290 , 191 aaronson m. , liebert j. , stocke j. , 1982 , apj 254 , 507 aaronson m. , mould j. , cook k.h . , 1985a , apj 291 , l41 aaronson m. , olszewski e.w . , hodge p.w . , 1983 , apj 267 , 271 aaronson m. , gordon g. , mould j. , olszewski e.w . , suntzeff n. , 1985b , apj 296 , l7 aaronson m. , da costa g.a , hartigan p. , mould j.r . , norris j. , stockman h.s . , 1984 ,",
