    "lattice study of @xmath10 decay matrix elements is important for the determination of cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements , and for investigations of applicability of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) which is extensively applied to phenomenological studies . in this work ,",
    "we calculate @xmath11 form factors using the heavy quark described by @xmath1 nrqcd and wilson light quark @xcite .",
    "numerical simulation is performed on 120 configurations of a @xmath2 lattice at @xmath3 in the quenched approximation .",
    "wilson light quark is employed with three values of @xmath12 , 0.1570 , 0.1585 and 0.1600 , which leads @xmath13 and lattice cutoff @xmath14 gev determined from @xmath15 meson mass .",

    "the mean - field improvement@xcite is applied to the heavy quark evolution equation with @xmath36 .",
    "the matrix elements are extracted from three point correlation functions , @xmath37 @xmath38 we use 20 rotationally nonequivalent sets of @xmath39 with @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the source and the current operators are set on the time slices @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
