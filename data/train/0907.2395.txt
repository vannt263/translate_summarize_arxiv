    "in recent years semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) has received much attention as a tool to investigate various aspects of hadron structure , such as the flavor dependence of the nucleon s parton distribution functions , both unpolarized and polarized , through flavor tagging of hadrons in the final state .",
    "observation of the momentum distribution of produced hadrons also allows access to the largely unexplored transverse momentum dependent parton distributions , which reveal a much richer landscape of the spin and momentum distribution of quarks in the nucleon , and which are the subject of increasingly greater focus at modern facilities such as jefferson lab .    at high energies",
    "the scattering and hadronization components of the sidis process factorize and the cross section can be represented as a product of parton distribution and fragmentation functions . in practice , however , experiments are often carried out at few - gev energies with @xmath0 as low as 1  gev@xmath1 , suggesting that @xmath2 power corrections must be controlled in order to determine the applicability of partonic analyses of the data .",
    "one of the standard finite-@xmath0 corrections that must be applied in analyses of _ inclusive _ deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) data is target mass corrections ( tmcs ) @xcite .",
    "kinematical in origin , tmcs arise from leading twist operators in qcd , but enter as @xmath2 corrections to structure functions @xcite .",
    "they are especially egregious at high values of the bjorken scaling variable @xmath3 , even at relatively large @xmath0 , and are crucial for reliable extractions of parton distributions in this region . to date , however , the phenomenology of tmcs has not been systematically considered in sidis , and we do so in this paper .    target mass corrections in inclusive dis have usually been formulated within the operator product expansion , in which the subleading @xmath2 corrections arise from twist - two operators involving derivative insertions into quark bilinears @xcite . unfortunately , this method can not be rigorously extended to the production of hadrons in the final state .",
    "an alternative approach to computing tmcs makes use of the collinear factorization ( cf ) framework @xcite , which has recently been used in both unpolarized @xcite and polarized @xcite inclusive dis .",
    "because here one works directly in momentum space , the method can be readily extended to sidis .",
    "in contrast to inclusive dis , where the only mass scale entering the problem is that of the target hadron , in sidis finite-@xmath0 corrections arise from both the target mass and the mass of the produced hadron . for generality",
    "we shall refer to their combined effects as `` hadron mass corrections '' ( hmcs ) .",
    "hadron mass corrections in sidis at finite-@xmath0 kinematics in cf were considered previously in refs .",
    "@xcite in different collinear frames .",
    "@xcite studied the effects of the final state hadron mass , but did not consider the effects of the target mass .",
    "mulders @xcite derived corrections due to both target and produced hadron mass , but did not discuss the phenomenological consequences .",
    "neither of these , however , addressed problems related to kinematic thresholds .    in this work we use the cf framework to derive the mass corrections to the sidis cross section at finite @xmath0 , and",
    "systematically investigate their implications at kinematics relevant to current experiments .",

    "[ sec : results ] we explore the relative importance of the hmcs numerically , and evaluate the size of the corrections in the cross sections and fragmentation functions at various kinematics . to assess their possible impact on data analyses",
    ", we also compare the magnitude of the hmcs at kinematics typical of modern facilities , such as jefferson lab and hermes , with experimental errors from recent experiments . finally , in sec .",

    "we begin the discussion of sidis at finite values of the photon virtuality @xmath0 by defining the relevant kinematics and momentum variables in a collinear frame , and introduce the hadronic tensor computed in a covariant parton model .",
    "collinear factorization is then performed in the leading order approximation in which the produced hadron is effectively collinear with the scattered parton , which more directly reveals the effects of hadron masses on the cross sections and fragmentation functions .",
    "the four - momenta of the target nucleon ( @xmath5 ) , virtual photon ( @xmath6 ) and produced hadron @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) can be decomposed in terms of light - cone unit vectors @xmath9 and @xmath10 as @xcite    @xmath11    [ eq : kinematics ]    where @xmath12 is the target nucleon mass , @xmath13 , and the light - cone vectors satisfy @xmath14 and @xmath15 . here",

    "were these experiments conducted at smaller angles , however , it is likely that hmcs would become important .    on the other hand , for the jefferson lab experiment e00 - 108 @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig:6](b ) at a similar @xmath0 but larger @xmath186 , the mass effects are approximately @xmath187 times larger than the experimental statistical errors .",
    "this illustrates the potentially significant impact that hmcs can have on leading - twist analyses of sidis data at moderate and large @xmath3 and low @xmath0 . to avoid these effects",
    "one would either need to go to smaller @xmath3 or larger @xmath0 values , for example afforded by the 12  gev energy upgrade at jefferson lab .",
    "alternatively , since the hmcs are calculated and model independent , lower @xmath0 and higher @xmath3 data will still yield useful leading twist information provided the mass corrections are accounted for .",
    "measurements at small @xmath188 and @xmath189  gev@xmath1 have been performed by the h1 collaboration @xcite at hera , and the data presented in terms of the fragmentation invariant @xmath105 .",
    "the phenomenology of hmcs is markedly different in terms of @xmath105 from that discussed thus far in terms of @xmath77 because of the different functional forms for @xmath38 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zeta_h ] ) , which constrains @xmath190 , and because of the jacobian @xmath191 . in their analysis of the h1 data ,",
    "@xcite included the @xmath38 rescaling of the fragmentation process , but neglected the effects of the target mass , which would be problematic for heavier hadrons such as kaons and protons .",
    "the h1 collaboration measured charged hadron multiplicities , dominated by pions ( @xmath19260% ) , with smaller contributions from kaons ( @xmath19230% ) and protons ( @xmath19210% ) . in the measured",
    "@xmath0 range the @xmath193 term in @xmath95 is therefore strongly suppressed and at the typically low @xmath3 values one has @xmath194 , so that overall we find the hmcs to be similar to those in ref .",
    "however , for identified kaons , and especially protons , the sidis cross section would be more strongly suppressed compared to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite because @xmath195 is significantly larger than @xmath3 .",
    "this suppression may be non - negligible for the extraction of kaon and proton fragmentation functions from small-@xmath3 data .",
    "in this paper we have derived hadron mass corrections to semi - inclusive deep inelastic cross sections at finite @xmath0 and have performed a systematic exploration of their phenomenological consequences . within the collinear factorization framework",
    "the modifications to the leading order sidis cross sections from initial and final state masses arise from a rescaling of the quark distribution and fragmentation functions in terms of the modified nachtmann scaling variable @xmath95 and a finite-@xmath0 fragmentation variable @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "the need for a modified nachtmann variable is dictated by the requirement that the physical kinematic thresholds for the semi - inclusive process are explicitly respected .",
    "we have examined the effects of the hadron mass corrections numerically at kinematics relevant to recent experiments , finding sizable effects at both small and large values of @xmath77 , as well as for increasing @xmath3 and @xmath27 , and low @xmath0 .",
    "our results emphasize the importance of controlling for such corrections in intermediate to high-@xmath3 experiments executed at low @xmath0 , of which measurements at jefferson lab are typical , although not exclusive .",
    "we find that the hadron mass corrections can in some cases compete with the quoted experimental errors ( as in the measurement of the ratio of unfavored to favored fragmentation functions @xmath196 ) or overwhelm them ( as in the cross section measurements ) . due to the presence of the modified nachtmann variable",
    "the hmcs may also need to be considered for small-@xmath3 collider experiments for the production of heavier hadrons such as kaons and protons , and their effects require further study .",
    "the most direct use of the results presented here will be in leading twist analyses of sidis cross sections , where the hmcs must be included before extracting information on parton distribution and fragmentation functions , especially at large @xmath3 and @xmath77 .",
    "application of this work can also be found in studies of semi - inclusive data in the nucleon resonance region , which has been the focus of attention recently in view of understanding the workings of quark - hadron duality @xcite .",
    "while the present analysis has been performed at leading order in @xmath4 , in the future we plan to extend the formalism to next - to - leading order , which will permit a more quantitative treatment of transverse mass dependence of the produced hadrons , @xmath197 .",
    "it will also allow contact with transverse momentum dependent parton distributions , in which nonzero parton transverse momentum , @xmath198 , is an essential element . finally , as in the inclusive dis case",
    ", the sidis cross section corrected for hadron mass effects exhibits the threshold problem which renders it nonzero as @xmath109 .",

    "a collinear frame in minkowski space is defined by any two four - vectors .",
    "the intersection of the plane where they lie with the light - cone defines the light - cone four - vectors @xmath199 and @xmath200 , that satisfy @xmath201 and @xmath202 . in sidis",
    "the hadronic tensor depends on the three vectors @xmath203 , @xmath204 and @xmath205 , which define three possible collinear frames denoted @xmath19 , @xmath206 and @xmath207 .",
    "the @xmath19 frame is the only frame that can be defined in dis and is the one used in this work ; the @xmath206 frame is the only one that can be defined in semi - inclusive hadron production in @xmath208 collisions ; and finally the @xmath207 frame is typically preferred for analysis of transverse momentum dependent parton distributions in sidis .    in terms of the vectors @xmath5 , @xmath6 and",
    "@xmath8 one can define two fragmentation invariants , @xmath209 which together with @xmath3 , @xmath0 , @xmath210 and @xmath211 form a complete set of scalar lorentz invariants in sidis . because the variable @xmath105 is defined independently of the target momentum",
    ", the effects of the final state hadron mass will decouple from those of the target mass in all reference frames .",
    "in contrast , @xmath77 is defined in terms of both the target and produced hadron momenta , so that the target and hadron mass effects here will be entangled .    the light - cone fractional momentum @xmath212 ( nachtmann variable ) and the fragmentation variable @xmath38 are defined in terms of the plus and minus components of the momenta as in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) and ( [ eq : zeta_h1 ] ) , @xmath213 we use these definitions in all three frames ; however , in each frame the light - cone vectors ( and therefore the plus and minus components of the four - momenta ) will be different . in the following",
    "we discuss each of the three collinear frames and the consequences within each frame of the choice of fragmentation invariant .        where @xmath216 is the transverse mass of the produced hadron .",
    "inverting the definition of @xmath3 , the nachtmann scaling variable can be written as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi ] ) , @xmath217 similarly , the hadron fractional momentum @xmath38 can be expressed in terms of either the fragmentation invariant @xmath77 , @xmath218 or in terms of @xmath105 , @xmath219 one can show that for any finite @xmath38 the variable @xmath220 in the bjorken limit .",
    "this is obviously true in any frame .        where @xmath223 is the transverse mass of the target nucleon .",
    "the nachtmann variable in this case is given by @xmath224 which , in contrast to its definition in the @xmath19 frame , depends explicitly on the transverse mass of the target nucleon .",
    "furthermore , in terms of the fragmentation invariant @xmath77 , the finite-@xmath0 fragmentation variable @xmath38 is given by @xmath225 or in terms of @xmath105 by @xmath226        where @xmath229 is the transverse mass of the virtual photon .",
    "the nachtmann variable in this frame depends explicitly on @xmath230 , @xmath231 and the finite-@xmath0 fragmentation variable is given by @xmath232 or @xmath233    * relations between frames . * in general the frames discussed here are distinct .",
    "however , to leading order in @xmath2 the vectors @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath8 lie in the same plane and the three frames in fact coincide . comparing the @xmath19 and @xmath206 frames , for example",
    ", the differences between the transverse momenta and scaling variables can be expressed as      where the asterisks ( @xmath235 ) label quantities in the @xmath206 frame .",
    "similar relations are applicable also for the parton fractional momentum @xmath70 and the hadron fractional momentum @xmath21 . at leading order in collinear factorization",
    "one has @xmath236 and the frames are manifestly equivalent .",
    "moreover , since @xmath237 for @xmath238-integrated cross sections at next - to - leading order the differences between the collinear frames should remain small . it will nevertheless be important to check whether , and in what kinematic range , this approximation is valid . on the other hand , for unintegrated cross sections",
