    "despite the large @xmath1 mass , it appears that a systematic expansion in @xmath2 and @xmath3 fails by about @xmath4@xcite to predict the semileptonic branching ratio @xmath5 this discrepancy presumably requires enhancement of the nonleptonic decay width and most likely will be resolved within the framework of the standard model .",
    "for example , it could be that local `` quark  hadron duality '' is not as good at the @xmath1 scale as originally hoped .",
    "in particular , one recent suggestion@xcite is that non  perturbative effects could significantly enhance the @xmath6 rate ( with relatively slow charm quarks in the final state ) beyond the naive @xmath7 phase space prediction .",
    "alternatively it has been pointed out that an enhanced @xmath8 rate via penguin amplitudes could help resolve the discrepancy.@xcite these will contribute only to the nonleptonic decay width , @xmath9 .",
    "these decays do not lead to charm production ( and hence the reason that their contribution could be added incoherently ) .",
    "therefore such enhanced penguin decays would not generate an unwanted charm excess@xcite .",

    "i.e. _ , @xmath23",
    ". using @xmath24 yields a rate 60 % of the above .",
    "a significant enhancement above standard model predictions is thus required for gluonic penguin decays to play a role in the semileptonic decay rate issue .",
    "admittedly this scenario may seem unlikely in view of the recent measurement by cleo@xcite of the inclusive photo  penguin decay rate , @xmath25 , found with a branching rate of only @xmath26 , and in general agreement with standard model predictions@xcite .",
    "nonetheless , a preferred enhancement of the gluonic penguin by some appropriate susy extension of the standard model relative to its electromagnetic analogue is conceivable .",
    "even an enhanced branching ratio @xmath27 of just a few percent could be part of a `` cocktail''@xcite solution for the semileptonic problem .    in the following we argue that inclusive measurements of the kaon spectrum ( presumably @xmath28 for experimental feasibility ) near the region of @xmath29 would be sensitive to @xmath30 rates in the range @xmath31 .",
    "we also discuss exclusive decay modes , in particular @xmath32 , first indications of which were possibly seen last year at cleo@xcite . here",

    "the inclusive momentum distributions for @xmath34@xcite and @xmath35@xcite have been experimentally measured .",

    "our main interest here however is in the endpoint region , @xmath54 for which much more precise data will be required and should be available from cleo ii . in this endpoint region",
    "one can directly show that @xmath55 for @xmath56 , both momentum variables @xmath57 must also approach their upper limit .",
    "the explicit distributions @xmath58 and @xmath59 thus yield two of the four powers in eq .",

    "the remaining two powers arise from phase space constraints generated by the @xmath60 functions which force @xmath61 if @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "( [ integrals ] ) and ( [ frag ] ) , the complete distribution , @xmath67 , of kaons from @xmath1 decays , is given by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the @xmath8 branching fraction . from the previous discussion",
    ", one knows that for any finite @xmath69 , at some sufficiently large @xmath70 , the @xmath64 quark fragmentation function must dominate .",
    "the issue now is to better quantify this result with a reasonable parametrization for @xmath71 .",
    "the new cleo @xmath72 data@xcite could in principle yield @xmath73 information in a setting which appears to be kinematically similar to that in @xmath8",
    ". nearly @xmath74 of all the @xmath72 inclusive decays occur through the @xmath75 resonance .",
    "if we simply focus on the kaons produced through the decay of the @xmath75 , one finds that the kaon spectrum is very hard as @xmath76 , with a typical value of @xmath77 ( replacing @xmath78 by @xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ uequation ] ) , taking @xmath80 , and noting that @xmath81 for the @xmath82wave decay @xmath83 ) .",
    "such a contribution would show up quite dramatically in @xmath84 for a penguin decay rate of order @xmath85 and indeed would allow ready determination of @xmath69 in eq.([rhotot ] ) to values as small as @xmath86 by integrating over the total kaon yield above @xmath87 . in an ideal case of infinite @xmath1 mass",
    "the @xmath64 quark from @xmath88 or @xmath25 would have identical fragmentation independent of the identity of the recoiling system ( gluon jet or single photon ) .",
    "however the use of this inclusive data for the actual @xmath1 mass , @xmath89gev , is somewhat dubious . for @xmath25 , the relevant total energy of the hadronizing system of the @xmath64 plus",
    "spectator @xmath90 is rather low , being roughly only @xmath91 as indeed is manifest by the fact that the @xmath75 and only a few other kaon resonances dominate the data . barring precocious",
    "scaling , extraction of accurate information on inclusive functions such as @xmath71 in such kinematics is questionable .",
    "the kinematics in the case of @xmath8 is , on the other hand , different .",
    "assuming the @xmath64 quark to recoil against an oppositely moving @xmath92 source , the total energy available for hadronization is now @xmath89gev and we expect the `` leading '' @xmath73 fragmentation to be similar to that in an @xmath93 process at these energies .",
    "indeed comparing even just the expected standard model rate , eq .",
    "( [ sminclest ] ) , with the upper bound given last year by cleo for @xmath32 ( @xmath94 ) indicates that the inclusive rate will not be dominated by just a few resonances .",
    "unfortunately @xmath73 fragmentation contributions in @xmath95 is charged suppressed by a factor @xmath96 and are hence difficult to extract from the known data on inclusive kaon production@xcite .",
    "likewise , @xmath64 quark jet production in deep inelastic @xmath97 scattering is cabibo suppressed by @xmath98 and hence not particularly useful .",
    "we are thus forced to work by analogy , guided by general symmetry principles .",
    "starting first from @xmath99 flavor symmetry , the inclusive @xmath100 spectrum spectrum from @xmath95 annihilation has been recently@xcite nicely fitted using a primary , direct @xmath101 term , @xmath102 , and a secondary distribution term @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 reflects the general fact that in qcd these distributions run with @xmath106 .",
    "the motivation of the authors of @xcite for departing from other , perhaps more common , forms in which @xmath107 is given jointly as one smooth function ( e.g. as in @xcite where @xmath108 ) is that the physics dictating the two end point regions is rather different .",
    "the logarithmic rise in total kaon number produced for @xmath109 is driven by mesons produced out of secondary quarks formed in the fragmentation chain of the outgoing quark jet .",
    "the region @xmath110 is dominated by mesons made out of the original quark in the jet .",
    "a separation of these two phenomena was crucial for the study in @xcite in which ( as is the case here ) the authors were particularly interested in the @xmath110 regime of the fragmentation function in order to compare with competing processes .    ignoring completely secondary kaon production , and assuming for the kaon the same primary distribution @xmath111 as in the pion , ( evolved down from the fitted @xmath112gev data , to @xmath113 using the analytic expression provided in @xcite ) , the result for @xmath84 , eq .",
    "( [ rhotot ] ) , using a value for @xmath114 is shown in fig .",

    "is included the result of fig .",
    "( 1 ) ( _ i.e. _ @xmath115 ) , and as is appropriate , we have focussed only on the end ",
    "point region @xmath116 .",
    "we see that for this `` maximal '' value of @xmath69 , a significant difference has developed in the expected kaon distributions once @xmath117 .",
    "accurate data at larger @xmath118 allows one to probe significantly smaller @xmath69 , so that for @xmath119 comparable differences appear at @xmath120 and at @xmath121 , a value as small as @xmath86 could be discerned .",
    "having demonstrated what should be an experimentally testable effect , it is likely that these estimates are however conservative .",
    "@xmath99 flavor symmetry is in fact broken and it is likely that the @xmath64 quark fragmentation function is harder than that of a @xmath51 quark .",
    "as an extreme alternative , we show the results in fig .",
    "( 3 ) of using the heavy quark fragmentation function of peterson _",
    "et al._@xcite @xmath122 ^ 2}\\label{heavyfrag}\\ ] ] in which @xmath123 is determined by fixing the normalization to integrate to one and @xmath124 is qualitatively @xmath125 , the ratio of effective light to heavy quark masses .",
    "note that the @xmath126 limit smoothly matches up to the parametrization of baier _",
    "et al._@xcite for a light ",
    "quark fragmentation function . in the case of charm",
    "a good fit to the data@xcite is found using @xmath127 . since in the case of the @xmath64 quark the choice of @xmath128 is more ambiguous ( if at all correct ) , fig .",
    "( 3 ) contains plots for a few possible @xmath128 values .",
    "as expected , the resulting distributions yield a significantly greater departure from the cascade scenario of kaon production than the one indicated by fig .",
    "( 2 ) where perfect su(3 ) flavor symmetry was assumed .",
    "the observation last year@xcite by the cleo group of the two body exclusive decay , @xmath129 was the first unambiguous experimental evidence of penguin processes .",
    "one likewise expects that rare two  body hadronic decays of the @xmath1meson to be a particularly useful means of measuring gluon mediated , @xmath130 transitions . for concreteness",
    ", we will focus on the mode @xmath32 which , as mentioned earlier , was likely seen last year at cleo@xcite ( the ambiguity involves insufficient experimental resolution to separate candidate @xmath131 from @xmath132 decay channels ) .    for the two body hadronic decays , penguin processes compete with another rare decay , @xmath133 , which occurs at tree  level in the standard model but is proportional to the ckm matrix elements @xmath134 .",
    "judicious comparison with analogous processes proportional to @xmath135 allows one to infer the relative importance of the gluonic penguin contribution . in the case of @xmath32",
    "the corresponding decay mode is @xmath136 .",
    "( hence the further importance that cleo resolve these two modes , the sum of which were reported with a total branching rate of @xmath137@xcite ) an observed ratio of branching rates much above ( or below ) the naive @xmath138 must be due to penguins .    using perturbative qcd methods recently seen@xcite to give a good description of the two body hadronic decays of the @xmath1 meson , we estimate in the standard model that @xmath139 not far from the cleo data of last year@xcite .",
    "such a result clearly does not allow much room for enhancement . however , the importance of bound  state effects must be emphasized .",
    "we will therefore sketch how our estimate eq .",
    "( [ pqcdest ] ) was obtained , in which some particularly simplifying approximations were used .",
    "a full analysis of the decay is the subject of a forthcoming work.@xcite    since the two body exclusive decays of the @xmath1 involve large mometum transfers , they are short distance events . a twist expansion in perturbative qcd suggests@xcite that only the contribution from the lowest order fock component expansions of the @xmath1 and of the outgoing mesons are relevant .",
    "the decay rate of the @xmath1 then involves a perturbatively calculable hard amplitude convoluted with a soft physics wave function , @xmath140 , from each of the mesons .",
    "these wavefunctions , although as yet uncalculable from first principles , are universal for each meson , _",
    "i.e. _ they factorize from the hard amplitude and hence are independent of the process involved .",
    "thus as was employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , ideally one can phenomenologically parametrize these wavefunctions using a ( few ) measured cross  sections / decay rates . for simplicity , we use the factorization scheme advocated by brodsky and lepage@xcite and take the momenta of the quarks as some fraction @xmath141 of the total momentum of the parent meson weighted by a soft physics distribution amplitude @xmath142 ( @xmath142 being then simply the quark s wavefunction @xmath143 integrated over transverse momentum , @xmath144 ) .",
    "an important ingredient in the perturbative qcd approach to the two body exclusive decays of the @xmath1 is that the decay amplitude can acquire an imaginary part because some heavy quark propagators in various feynman graphs can go on  shell in the integration over the mesonic distribution amplitudes . here",
    "as elsewhere @xcite , @xcite , picking up such poles is legitimate in pqcd as they are not pinched singularites and hence by the coleman ",
    "norton theorem @xcite , are not associated with a long distance event .",
    "these poles arise ( in part ) because of the factorization scheme we employ and because of what one believes to be the correct relation between quark and meson masses : @xmath145 where @xmath146mev . since it has been found in practice@xcite that these imaginary parts tend to dominate the decay amplitude when they occur",
    ", we will here focus on them to obtain our estimate eq .",
    "( [ pqcdest ] ) with the more complete study to be presented elsewhere@xcite .    for our present purposes",
    "then , the most relevant graph contributing to the decay rate @xmath32 is shown in figure ( 4 ) .",
    "the square indicates a gluonic penguin , the operator structure of which will be presently discussed .",
    "the cross indicates the heavy ",
    "quark propagator that can go on  shell .",
    "we note that graphs at this order in @xmath2 other than that shown have imaginary parts , but they are suppressed by factors of @xmath147 . unlike the case of the inclusive cross ",
    "section considered in the previous section , the restriction to explicit hadronic modes in the final state means that the virtuality of the quark and gluon legs entering the penguin decay @xmath88 can not be discounted .",
    "hence more than merely the simple chromo ",
    "magnetic penguin operator @xmath148 , eq .",
    "( [ mpeng ] ) , contributes and in particular , it is found that chromo ",
    "electric penguins @xmath149 are highly relevant ( indeed they in fact dominate our estimate for the @xmath150 decay rate ) .",
    "including then both operators @xmath148 and @xmath151 , with wilson coefficents @xmath14 and @xmath152 respectively , the contribution ( i ) of the diagram in figure ( 1 ) to the decay amplitude is given by the expression @xmath153 where @xmath154 is given by @xmath155 and a peaking approximation has been used for @xmath156 @xmath157 @xmath158 is the decay constant of the @xmath1 .    using the distribution amplitude of chernyak and zhitnitsky@xcite for the pion and for simplicity , the asymptotic distribution amplitude@xcite for the kaon , + @xmath159    the imaginary piece of eq .",
    "( [ figures ] ) becomes : @xmath160    we use @xmath161 to obtain our estimate of the decay rate @xmath162 as parameters we use @xmath163 for the scale @xmath17 we take the virtuality of the softest gluon exchanged , @xmath164 .",
    "for the evolution of @xmath152 , only cella _ et al .",
    "@xcite have calculated the anomalous dimension mixing matrix relevant for the chromo  electric penguins , and thus we use their results .",
    "this might be thought imprudent , considering the controversy that was associated with the chromomagnetic penguins@xcite .",
    "we note however that in the case of the chromomagnetic penguins , the final results of ciuchini _",
    "et al._@xcite differ only slightly from that of cella _ et al .",
    "_ for those operators mutually calculated , and hence one might expect that any errors due to scheme dependence would be kept at a minimum . such is our hopes in the present work , although we acknowledge and stress the importance that these expectations be confirmed .    with these inputs",
    "we obtain that @xmath165 where the superscript @xmath166 reminds the reader this estimate is based only on picking up the ( leading ) imaginary part of the decay amplitude . roughly assuming that the real part ( which adds incoherently but involves many more graphs and also in principle more off",
    " shell operators ) is of the same order , we obtain eq .",
    "( [ pqcdest ] ) .",
    "we note that similar such bound  state effects have been previously considered@xcite in the case of @xmath129 decays , however there the physical on  shell photon eliminates the electromagnetic version of eq .",
    "( [ epeng ] ) . only bound ",
    "state effects involving the off ",
    "shell character of the quark propagators were thus needed to be considered .",
    "although large in amplitude , these amusingly were found , due to accidents of phase , to have minimal effect on the decay rate assuming standard model parameters of @xmath15 .",
    "the purely hadronic two body decay @xmath32 does not however enjoy such simplifying features .",
    "chromoelectric penguins are found to be highly relevant because the restriction to a @xmath132 final state allows for the gluons to be significantly off  shell and because the wilson coefficient of the chromo  electric operator is appreciablely larger than that of the chromo ",
    "magnetic operator ( at either the @xmath167 scale or when ran to lower scales appropriate for the decay of the @xmath1 ) .",
    "the complications of bound  state effects and in particular the introduction of additional operators thus allows , at least in principle , significant differences between the inclusive rates discussed in section ( ii ) and that of any particular decay mode as discussed here .",
    "one tenable although perhaps contrived scenario is that _ only _",
    "@xmath148 is significantly enhanced .",
    "although somewhat bizarre , especially since for the gluon penguins it is at a fundamental level the same feynman graphs that determine the wilson coefficients of both the chromomagnetic as well as chromoelectric operators , such a scenario can not nevertheless be precluded .",
    "indeed the fact that qcd corrections play an important role and produce significant changes in both the absolute magnitudes and relative sizes of the various coefficients , means that such a scenario might yet be feasible .",
    "however one should recall that this preferential treatment would also have to extend into the electromagnetic sector where the data@xcite also does not allow significant departure from standard model predictions .",
    "it is well known that deviation of @xmath25 and @xmath168 amplitudes from standard model estimates could directly indicate new physics .",
    "the study of potential @xmath8 enhancement is further motivated by its possible contribution to resolving the @xmath1 semileptonic problem .",
    "we have here discussed the possibility of detecting such enhancement and estimating the overall strength of @xmath88 transitions by focusing on the resulting inclusive kaon distribution in the region near @xmath169 and alternatively looking at the extreme case of @xmath170 corresponding to the ( penguin generated ) @xmath32 exclusive final state .",
    "clearly future studies could make use of the much richer topologies in an effort to have a more sensitive extraction of @xmath8 .",
    "remarkably however , mere use of the inclusive kaon distribution will be sufficiently sensitive to an enhanced @xmath8 total rate of even just a few percent as the significantly harder kaons near @xmath169 that result from the penguin decays would dominate over the softer kaons from the ordinary cascade @xmath171 .",
    "the exclusive @xmath32 decay mode is sensitive to the chromoelectric penguin term .",
    "present data and standard model estimates already would appear to exclude enhancement of this operator by more than a factor of two or so , although potential uncertainties exist concerning the evolution of such `` off  shell '' operators that may yet modify these estimates . even barring such complications , these conclusions while suggestive nevertheless do not preclude a significantly large enhancement in the total , inclusive production of kaons as the chromoelectric operator vanishes for on  shell gluons and",
    "hence does not contribute to the perturbatively calculated , inclusive @xmath8 decay rate ( obtained using chromomagnetic penguin transitions ) .    given these initial results and in view of the fact that enhanced @xmath8 decays are indications of new physics , the simple first step of looking for it via the inclusive kaon spectrum , complemented by better data on the exclusive two  body decays , seems an undoubtedly worthwhile enterprise .",
