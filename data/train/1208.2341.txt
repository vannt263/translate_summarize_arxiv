    "nucleosynthesis via rapid neutron capture , the @xmath0-process , is a major mechanism for producing the elements heavier than fe  @xcite .",
    "understanding this process requires knowledge of properties such as masses , @xmath11-decay lifetimes , and neutron - capture cross sections for a large number of extremely neutron - rich nuclei far from stability ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "most of this nuclear input is beyond the reach of experiments in the foreseeable future and , therefore , must be calculated with guidance from existing data and from measurements to be made at rare - isotope beam facilities such as the gsi facility for antiproton and ion research ( fair ) , the facility for rare isotope beams ( frib ) , the heavy ion research facility in lanzhou cooling storage ring ( hirfl - csr ) , and rikagaku kenkyusho ( riken , institute of physical and chemical research , japan ) . in this paper",
    "we explore the importance of nuclear masses in estimating the temperature and neutron density conditions required for a specific @xmath0-process scenario , where neutron - capture reactions are in equilibrium with the reverse photodisintegration reactions ; i.e. , there is @xmath12 equilibrium ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . using four nuclear mass models ,",
    "we show that the required conditions can be determined mostly from the neutron - separation energies for a small number of critical nuclei with @xmath13 , 82 , and 126 closed neutron shells . for each model",
    ", we further determine the best - fit sets of conditions to reproduce the @xmath0-process abundance pattern ( @xmath0-pattern ) inferred for the solar system and observed in metal - poor stars of the milky way halo .",
    "this allows us to draw several interesting conclusions regarding the production of different parts of the overall @xmath0-pattern in an @xmath12 equilibrium scenario .",
    "we also illustrate the effects of nuclear mass uncertainties on the required @xmath0-process conditions and identify the key nuclei that have the largest impact and , therefore , are important candidates for precise mass measurements at rare - isotope beam facilities .",
    "we first give a brief overview of the @xmath0-process .",
    "detailed reviews can be found in ref .",
    "historically , the abundance distribution of nuclei in the solar system played a crucial role in studies on the origin of the elements  @xcite .",
    "one of the prominent features of this distribution is the presence of three sets of double peaks in the region beyond the fe group nuclei .",
    "this was recognized as signatures of two distinct processes of neutron capture : a slow ( @xmath14 ) one encountering the @xmath13 , 82 , and 126 closed neutron shells in the stable region and a rapid ( @xmath0 ) one encountering the same in the extremely neutron - rich region of the nuclear chart  @xcite .",
    "specifically , the peaks at mass numbers @xmath1 , 130 , and 195 were produced by the @xmath0-process and represent the crucial features of the solar @xmath0-pattern , which is derived by subtracting the @xmath14-process contributions from the net solar abundances ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in order to fully understand the @xmath0-process , we need conditions such as temperature and neutron density in the associated astrophysical environments in addition to the properties of a large number of extremely neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "neither the astrophysical nor the nuclear input is firmly established , although much progress has been made over the past two decades  @xcite .",
    "proposed astrophysical sites for the @xmath0-process include neutrino - driven winds from proto - neutron stars formed in core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne )  @xcite , shocked surface layers of o - ne - mg cores associated with low - mass ccsne  @xcite , winds from accretion disks of black holes formed in high - mass ccsne  @xcite , he shells of metal - poor ccsne  @xcite , and ejecta from neutron star mergers  @xcite .",
    "there are large uncertainties in the conditions associated with all ccsne environments due to the substantial uncertainties in modeling such environments ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , especially when neutrino transport in hot and dense nuclear matter is considered ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "while recent studies lend much support to neutron star mergers being an @xmath0-process site  @xcite , it remains to be seen whether such models are consistent with the history of @xmath0-process enrichments in the milky way and in its satellite dwarf galaxies ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "further , how sensitive these models are to the uncertainties in the current understanding of the nuclear equation of state ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and to the numerical treatment of the merger dynamics remains to be studied in detail .",
    "the conditions in the astrophysical environments relevant for the @xmath0-process ultimately boil down to the seed nuclei for neutron capture at the beginning of the process and the temperature @xmath15 and the neutron ( number ) density @xmath16 as functions of time @xmath17 during the process ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in cases where neutrino interactions are important ,",
    "the time evolution of neutrino fluxes and energy spectra is also required ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in the rest of the paper we will ignore neutrinos and focus on a broad class of astrophysical environments where matter undergoes @xmath0-processing at @xmath18  k and @xmath19  @xmath20 . for such high temperatures and neutron densities ,",
    "previous studies have shown that @xmath12 equilibrium is achieved ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in this equilibrium ,",
    "the abundance distribution in each isotopic chain at a specific proton number @xmath21 is almost always strongly peaked at one nucleus .",
    "this is referred to as a waiting - point ( wp ) nucleus because , upon reaching it , the @xmath0-process must wait for it to @xmath11-decay before producing heavier nuclei . under this so - called wp approximation ,",
    "the @xmath0-process path is defined by all the wp nuclei heavier than the seed nuclei , and the progress along this path is regulated by the @xmath11-decay of these wp nuclei .",
    "so long as this approximation is valid , there is no need to follow neutron capture and photodisintegration reactions , which greatly simplifies the @xmath0-process calculation .    due to the equilibrium between neutron capture and photodisintegration reactions ,",
    "the abundance ratio between two neighboring isotopes is given by the saha equation ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) : @xmath22,\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the planck constant , @xmath24 is the atomic mass unit , @xmath25 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath26 indicates a nucleus with proton number @xmath21 and mass number @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 denote the number abundance , partition function , and neutron separation energy of the appropriate nucleus , respectively . for a specific isotopic chain ,",
    "the corresponding wp nucleus has the largest abundance and is determined by the partition functions and neutron separation energies of the relevant nuclei for fixed @xmath31 and @xmath32 . as can be seen from the exponential dependence on the neutron separation energy in eq .",
    "( [ equilibrium ] ) , nuclear masses are among the most important input for modeling the @xmath0-process .",
    "the other crucial input is @xmath11-decay lifetimes of the relevant nuclei .    over the past two decades",
    ", tremendous progress has been made in measuring nuclear properties relevant for the @xmath0-process .",
    "for example , the @xmath11-decay half - lives of 38 very neutron - rich isotopes bordering the @xmath0-process path have been measured recently  @xcite . in addition",
    ", the masses of a group of nuclei including @xmath33zn  @xcite and @xmath34cd  @xcite have been measured with a very high accuracy  @xcite . meanwhile ,",
    "considerable advance has been made in the theoretical investigation of nuclear masses .",
    "the four nuclear mass models used in this paper span from the macroscopic - microscopic kind , represented by the finite - range droplet model ( frdm )  @xcite and a more recent weizscker - skyrme ( ws * ) model  @xcite , to the microscopic kind , represented by the skyrme - hartree - fock - bogolyubov mean - field ( hfb-17 ) model  @xcite and the relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) model  @xcite .",
    "these models can reproduce the experimentally known neutron separation energies with a root - mean - square ( rms ) deviation of 0.399 ( frdm ) , 0.332 ( ws * ) , 0.506 ( hfb-17 ) , and 0.653 ( rmf ) mev , respectively .",
    "based on the above overview , there are two frontiers of @xmath0-process research : one focusing on the search for the astrophysical sites and quantification of the conditions therein and the other on acquiring a reliable database for the relevant nuclear input",
    ". observations of elemental abundances in metal - poor stars of the milky way halo ( see  @xcite for a review ) have shed important light on the @xmath0-process sites ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the observed @xmath0-patterns also provide an important test of the basic soundness of the nuclear input ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . of course",
    ", the astrophysical and the nuclear input must be coupled together in order to produce an @xmath0-pattern for comparison with observations . with substantial uncertainties in the current understanding of both the @xmath0-process sites and the nuclear input , parametrization of the astrophysical conditions",
    "is often used in exploring the effects of nuclear input on @xmath0-process production ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . as a practical matter",
    ", we adopt the classical approach of using @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and the corresponding neutron irradiation time @xmath35 along with the wp approximation ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) to carry out our @xmath0-process calculations below .",
    "our main purpose is to explore the effects of the four nuclear mass models mentioned above on the @xmath31 and @xmath32 conditions required for @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis .    a number of other studies on how the nuclear input impacts @xmath0-process nucleosynthesis have been carried out recently .",
    "the influence of nuclear properties from different mass models on the final @xmath0-pattern was analyzed in ref .",
    "the effect of neutron capture rates for nuclei near the @xmath4 peak on the overall @xmath0-pattern was investigated in ref .",
    "the sensitivity of the calculated @xmath0-pattern to the combined effects of the long - term dynamic evolution of the astrophysical environment and the nuclear input was explored in ref .",
    "the effect of long - range correlations for nuclear masses on the production of nuclei immediately below and in the @xmath36 peak was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite . in all of the above studies parametric",
    "astrophysical models that allow @xmath31 and @xmath32 to evolve with time were adopted .",
    "these models are more realistic but the choice of parameters is not so straightforward . in the future , we plan to use similar models to study the interplay between the astrophysical and the nuclear input during the @xmath0-process .",
    "our goal here is to explore the @xmath31 and @xmath32 conditions required for the @xmath0-process in an @xmath12 equilibrium scenario and the effects of nuclear mass models on these conditions . for this limited goal",

    "we give a detailed discussion of the wp approximation in sec .",

    "[ sec : discuss ] .",
    "while there are substantial uncertainties in both the @xmath0-process sites and the relevant nuclear input , an essential feature of the @xmath0-process is considered robust : the observed abundance peaks at @xmath1 , 130 , and 195 correspond to the intrinsic properties of extremely neutron - rich nuclei with @xmath13 , 82 , and 126 closed neutron shells that are produced in the @xmath0-process . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , when @xmath12 equilibrium is achieved , the total abundance of an isotopic chain is concentrated in the corresponding wp nucleus .",

    "in particular , the much longer @xmath11-decay lifetimes of extremely neutron - rich nuclei with closed neutron shells than those without produce peaks in @xmath0-patterns .",
