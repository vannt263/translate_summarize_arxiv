    "infrared ( ir ) and millimeter astronomy , together with astrophysical theory , have made great progress in understanding the formation of single stars in small molecular cloud cores on @xmath6  pc scales .",
    "however , most stars do not form in such simple environments , arising rather in turbulent giant molecular clouds where different modes of star formation are seen : rich ob - dominated stellar clusters , smaller clusters in dense ir dark clouds and filaments , and stellar groups on the peripheries of expanding h regions .",
    "it is not clearly known how cloud cores and filaments form , whether clusters form during a single free - fall time or over millions of years , or whether triggering by h regions or supernova remnants play minor or major roles .",
    "combined infrared and x - ray surveys , such as the _ chandra carina complex project _ ( cccp ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have the advantage of locating both recently formed disk - bearing ( proto)stars and older pre - main sequence ( pms ) stars .",
    "these studies reveal spatially distinct clusters that appear to have different ages , and often a population of older widely distributed stars dispersed from earlier generations of star formation .",
    "our group is now engaged in the massive young star - forming complex study in infrared and x - ray ( mystix ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that examines 20 star forming complexes .",
    "mystix fields include a range of small and large cloud structures producing sparse and rich stellar clusters .",
    "a major impediment to understanding star formation in massive star forming regions ( msfrs ) has been the absence of a reliable stellar chronometer so that the star formation history in a region can be reconstructed . while embedded protostars with class 0 and class i infrared spectral energy distributions ( ir seds ) clearly represent the most recent episodes of star formation activity , the sequence of past activity is difficult to unravel from ir seds alone because dusty protoplanetary disks have a wide range of longevities .",
    "approximately 10% of stars lose their disks in @xmath7  myr , 10% retain their disks for @xmath8  myr , and the remaining 80% have disk longevities smoothly distributed between 0.5 and 6  myr @xcite .",
    "the disk fraction commonly used to estimate the age of a young stellar sample ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and citations thereof ) , roughly the ratio # ( class  i + class  ii)/#(class  i + class  ii + class  iii ) , therefore can only give a crude measure of stellar ages .",
    "other stellar properties once proposed as chronometers , such as the depletion of photospheric lithium or the evolution of stellar rotation , do not show simple scalings with stellar age during the pms phase @xcite .",
    "the best hope for an accurate stellar age estimator during the pms evolutionary phase has been location on the hertzsprung - russell diagram ( hrd ) or photometric color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , where stars of a fixed mass are predicted to progress along distinct tracks defined by convective interior models .",
    "unfortunately , many problems are now recognized to affect a star s location in hrds : photometric variability from accretion and magnetic activity , different accretional histories , binarity , extinction uncertainty , veiling from accretion , scattering and absorption by disks , stellar interiors model uncertainty , and distance uncertainty ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these issues have recently been reviewed by @xcite who emphasizes that ` severe misinterpretations , gross overestimates of the age spread , and ill - based conclusions about the star formation history ' can result from insufficient treatment of these effects .",
    "preibisch also emphasizes the importance of disentangling the distinct subgroups that are often present in a star forming region in order to establish the ` temporal sequence of several discrete star formation episodes ' .    in   [ concept_section ] and [ understanding_method_section ]",
    ", we describe a new pms stellar age estimator , @xmath0 , that depends on near - ir stellar photospheric emission and on hard x - ray luminosity which arises mostly from enhanced magnetic flaring of pms stars .",
    "near - ir and x - ray photometric measurements are provided in surveys such as cccp and mystix where they are used in the selection of msfr members .",
    "@xmath0 is applied only to carefully chosen subsamples of members with appropriate near - ir and x - ray data , and is based on an empirical x - ray / mass relation calibrated to well - studied taurus pms stars @xcite and to theoretical evolutionary tracks calculated by @xcite .",
    "this age estimate mitigates some ( although not all ) of the above problems encountered in hrd- and cmd - based chronometry (  [ some_advantage_subsection ] ) .",
    "individual star @xmath0 values for the mystix msfrs range from @xmath9 to @xmath10  myr ( table  [ tbl_individual_ages ] ) .    as with other methods ,",
    "we find a range of pms @xmath0 values in large - scale msfrs that could be considered to be a general wide spread in ages (  [ reddening_effect_section]-[subregions_subclusters_section ] ) .",
    "but , in accord with the advice of @xcite , we recompute ages averaged over spatially distinct subclusters (  [ subregions_subclusters_section ] ) that were recently obtained by @xcite for mystix msfrs . in that study ,",
    "a statistical ` finite mixture model ' of isothermal ellipsoids was fit to the sky distribution of probable cloud members using maximum likelihood techniques .",
    "each star can then be assigned as a member of a specific subcluster or as a member of a distributed unclustered population .",
    "the result of computing @xmath0 averaged over these subclusters is often remarkable : the full msfr age distribution spanning several million years now appears as spatially segregated structures with narrowly constrained ages .",
    "furthermore , we often see that the subclusters form spatial - absorption gradients consistent with astronomically reasonable patterns of star formation histories , with older lightly absorbed structures on one side , younger heavily absorbed structures on the other side , and intermediate - age structures in the middle (  [ age_gradients_section ] ) .",
    "widely distributed populations are nearly always older .",
    "the progression of star formation within a msfr can be traced , and patterns of star formation histories can be compared between msfrs .",
    "we provide a homogeneous set of averaged @xmath0 for a hundred subclusters and regions of interest in mystix msfrs ( table  [ tbl_cluster_ages ] ) .",
    "the method developed here has three steps .    1 .   the stellar mass ( @xmath11 ) is derived from the intrinsic x - ray luminosity measurement ( @xmath12 ) of a star using the well - established empirical @xmath1 relationship for pms stars of @xcite (  [ lx_mass_pms_section ] ) .",
    "2 .   the sample is truncated to include only low - mass stars and the absolute @xmath2-band magnitude ( @xmath13 ) is derived by correcting the apparent @xmath2 magnitude for a photometrically estimated absorption @xmath14 and distance .",
    "notice that , unlike optical magnitudes ( or ir magnitudes at longer wavelengths ) , @xmath2 is less prone to the effects of absorption , accretion , and diffuse nebular background ( or disks and nebular background ) (  [ some_advantage_subsection ] ) .",
    "@xmath2 is more prone to the effects of absorption than @xmath15 and @xmath16 near - infrared magnitudes , but is less affected by thermal disk emission .",
    "we estimate stellar ages @xmath0 using obtained mass estimate @xmath11 and the absolute @xmath2-band magnitude @xmath13 by comparison to the pms isochrones of @xcite .",
    "this @xmath17 diagram is a surrogate for the traditional hrd ( figure [ fig_mj_vs_mass_ajfromccd_smooth_medians_v2 ] ) .",
    "the observational inputs to the calculation are : the distance to the msfr and @xmath13 we use distances to each msfr adopted for the mystix project ( table 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "] , the absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity in the @xmath18  kev energy band , and the apparent @xmath19 magnitudes as well as the @xmath20 and interstellar reddening calibration relations and theoretical evolutionary tracks .",
    "the 31,784 mystix probable complex members ( mpcms ) constitute the initial stellar sample for this study @xcite .",
    "the mpcm sample is extracted from source catalogs constructed by special analysis of data from the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ , _ spitzer space telescope _ , united kingdom infra - red telescope , and 2mass telescopes .",
    "the mpcms are a union of statistically classified x - ray selected stars , photometric infrared excess stars , and published ob stars .",
    "the multistage construction of the mpcm sample is described by @xcite and its accompanying papers . @xcite and @xcite present x - ray sources and properties , @xcite present the near - ir sources and properties , @xcite present the mid - ir sources and properties , @xcite describe the x - ray / infrared source matching procedure ,",
    "@xcite identify infrared - excess stars , and @xcite statistically derive the integrated sample of mpcms in the 20 mystix msfrs .",
    "intrinsic stellar x - ray luminosities @xmath12 ( in the @xmath21  kev band ) are determined in a uniform way using the non - parametric method @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 is applicable to x - ray sources with greater than several net counts , and allows an approximate recovery of the soft ( @xmath23  kev ) x - ray plasma component , which is often missed in the x - ray data of weak and/or highly absorbed sources when using traditional methods of parametric model fitting , such as xspec .",
    "we therefore distill , from the full mpcm catalog , sources with xphot @xmath12 estimates .",
    "individual stellar age estimates @xmath0 are restricted to 5525 mpcm members .",
    "first , the full mpcm sample was restricted to stars with sufficient x - ray counts to have an @xmath22 estimate of @xmath12 .",
    "all mystix infrared excess ( mires ; * ? ? ? * ) sources without x - ray counterparts , and very faint x - ray sources , are omitted .",
    "second , three mystix regions ( w  3 , w  4 , and ngc  3576 ) , which were not subject to spatial clustering analysis by @xcite , and two mystix regions ( rcw  38 and trifid nebula ) with poor @xmath0 sampling are ignored from our detailed age analysis .",
    "third , the x - ray source sample is truncated to retain sources with reliable nir photometry , retaining sources with uncertainties on individual @xmath19 measurements of @xmath24  mag or uncertainties on @xmath5 and @xmath25 colors of @xmath24  mag .",
    "this permits reasonably accurate absorption correction .",
    "fourth , the sample is culled of objects with large @xmath26-excesses for which there is no clear nir dereddening procedures .",
    "objects with @xmath25 colors redder than those of the well studied disk - bearing stars in the taurus star forming region are removed from the sample ( figure [ fig_jhk_ccd ] ) .",
    "many of these objects with extreme @xmath16-excess emission are likely protostars @xcite .",
    "future mystix papers will focus on properties of these objects . finally , we apply two cuts to the sample to restrict consideration to lower - mass stars that follow convective hayashi tracks in the hrd .",
    "first , stars with @xmath27  erg s@xmath28 are removed . from the @xmath20 calibration curve of @xcite ,",
    "this deletes stars with @xmath29  m@xmath30 .",
    "second , stars with @xmath31  mag are removed ; this excludes lightly absorbed hotter early - type stars .",
    "it is important to note that for the stars in the final mystix @xmath0 sample , the typical number of x - ray net counts per source is @xmath32 counts and the typical poisson noise and modeling uncertinties on x - ray luminosity inferred by the xphot method are @xmath33% each .",
    "thus from the original 31,784 mpcm stars , we are left with a subsample of 5525 well - characterized relatively x - ray - bright low - mass stars for @xmath0 determination .",
    "the extinctions in the @xmath2-band ( @xmath14 ) are derived from dereddening to the intrinsic color locus of the taurus low - mass stars in the @xmath5 vs. @xmath25 color - color diagram ( figure [ fig_jhk_ccd ] ) .",
    "the taurus locus is produced using the data of @xcite ( and k. luhman , private communication ) ; the reddening laws @xmath34 and @xmath35 are used @xcite .",
    "the absolute magnitudes @xmath13 are then determined from @xmath2 , @xmath14 , and the mystix region distance estimates compiled by @xcite .",
    "notice that the xphot @xmath12 estimates are totally independent of nir reddening ; @xmath12 s were corrected for absorption using x - ray median energies as surrogates for x - ray absorption column densities , as described by @xcite .",
    "stellar mass estimates are derived from the @xmath12 values using the clear ( but poorly understood ;  [ lx_mass_pms_section ] )",
    "regression relationship @xmath36 found for pms stars in the taurus region @xcite .",
    "the minor effect of the weak temporal evolution of x - ray luminosity in pms stars @xcite , if real , is ignored in our analysis (  [ lx_mass_pms_section ] ) .",
    "@xmath0 estimates are then produced by minimizing @xmath37 between the observed absorption - corrected @xmath2-band magnitudes and x - ray - based mass estimates ( @xmath13 , @xmath38 , @xmath11 , @xmath39 ) and the grid of evolutionary tracks associated with the pms stellar interior models of @xcite .",
    "the age step in this grid is 0.1  myr .",
    "since smaller @xmath13 separations among older isochrones on the @xmath17 diagram could result in unrealistically high individual age estimates , the evolutionary models used here stop at 5  myr .",
    "the resulting @xmath0 estimates for 5525 mystix stars are given in table [ tbl_individual_ages ] along with the mystix designation , sky coordinates , nir photometry , absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity , and cluster membership from @xcite .",
    "before presenting the results from the @xmath0 method on the ages of the mystix regions and subclusters (  [ subregions_subclusters_section ] ) , in the current section , we discuss various aspects of the @xmath0 estimates of pms ages : the underlying relationships between stellar properties , sources of uncertainty and scatter , and comparison with other methods .",
    "the @xmath0 method relies on an assumption of a universal @xmath1 relationship for @xmath40  myr old pms stars .",
    "the relationship was originally found in @xmath41 studies of nearby star forming regions @xcite , and has been described in major studies of the taurus ( xest ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and orion nebula cluster ( coup ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) populations .",
    "the correlation in taurus stars is tighter than in orion stars , probably due to their more reliable stellar mass estimates .",
    "@xmath1 distributions similar to that seen in taurus and the onc are seen in other regions ; for instance , in the @xmath42  myr old ngc  2264 region @xcite , the @xmath43  myr old cep  ob3b region @xcite , the @xmath23  myr old w  40 region @xcite , and the @xmath43  myr old ic  348 region @xcite .",
    "the sources of scatter in the @xmath20 relationship will be statistical noise , x - ray variability from magnetic activity , binarity , intrinsic imperfection of the relationship , modeling uncertainties on @xmath12 and mass , and suppression of time - integrated x - ray emission in accreting versus non - accreting stars .",
    "while both accreting ` classical ' t tauri stars and non - accreting ` weak - line ' t tauri stars have broad x - ray luminosity functions ranging from @xmath44 erg s@xmath28 , it was found with @xmath41 @xcite that the x - ray luminosity function of accreting stars is somewhat lower than that of non - accreting stars .",
    "this is seen despite the frequent presence of a soft x - ray component associated with the accretion spot on the stellar surface @xcite",
    ". however , the effect could be mass dependent : for the pms population in the nearby taurus region , @xcite report that accreting stars are less x - ray active than non - accreting stars for a wide range of masses ( @xmath45  m@xmath30 ) ; meanwhile , for the richer pms populations in the more distant orion nebula cluster and ic  348 region , @xcite and @xcite report no differences in x - ray activity between accreting and non - accreting stars in the mass range @xmath46  m@xmath30 .",
    "the latter is a typical mass range for the mystix-@xmath0 stars ( figure [ fig_mj_vs_mass_ajfromccd_smooth_medians_v2 ] ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "pms stars lie coincident with the activity - saturation locus of main - sequence ( ms ) stars on the @xmath47-rossby ( or @xmath47-rotation ) diagram ; albeit , the scatter in @xmath47 is large .",
    "examples of the activity - rossby relationship for the pms stars in onc , taurus , ngc  2264 , and ic  348 can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "since the pms stars are in the magnetically saturated regime of late - type stars , one may reasonably expect their @xmath47 ratio to remain constant in time and @xmath20 to be simply a consequence of the mass - bolometric luminosity relation ( @xmath48 ) coupled with the effect of the x - ray saturation .",
    "however , the @xmath49 relationship for pms stars is a strong function of time as the stars descend the convective hayashi tracks @xcite .",
    "having the largest and most comprehensive ir / x - ray dataset of pms stars at a wide range of ages allows us to consider if either of these two relationships ( @xmath50 or @xmath1 ) may remain unvarying ( or slowly varying ) with time during the early evolutionary phase of pms stars .",
    "we transform the @xmath13 , @xmath51 , and @xmath11 outcome of the theoretical evolutionary pms models of @xcite onto an @xmath52 plane based on two different assumptions : @xmath53 is fixed for all stars and evolutionary stages ; and similarly @xmath20 is fixed for all stars and evolutionary stages . in the former case , the @xmath51 outcome of siess et al .",
    "is substituted with @xmath12 using the respective transformation from @xcite , @xmath54 . in the latter case",
    ", the @xmath11 outcome is substituted with @xmath12 using the respective transformation from @xcite , @xmath36 .",
    "figure [ fig_mj_vs_lx_two_views ] compares these two treatments with the @xcite isochrones .",
    "the top panel shows inconsistencies when constant @xmath53 is assumed .",
    "various mystix regions appear either younger than 0.5  myr , older than 100  myr , or have @xmath55 distributions that cross isochrones .",
    "the lower panel , where @xmath20 is assumed constant , shows much better consistency between models and data .",
    "each mystix region distribution in the @xmath56 diagram roughly follows a reasonable theoretical pms isochrone ; for instance , the embedded flame nebula and w  40 regions are associated with the youngest isochrones ( @xmath57  myr ;  [ age_flame_subsection ] and [ age_w40_subsection ] ) while the isolated ngc  2362 cluster is associated with the oldest isochrones ( @xmath58  myr ;  [ age_ngc2362_subsection ] ) .",
    "notice that @xcite report the effect of the weak temporal evolution of x - ray luminosity during the first several myr of pms evolution , @xmath59 .",
    "we tested the impact of this possible effect on our inferred age estimates by modifying the shape of the @xcite model isochrones shown in figure  [ fig_mj_vs_lx_two_views]b with the following formula : @xmath60 , where the fiducial @xmath61 , as a typical age for both the taurus and orion regions , was varied between @xmath62 $ ]  myr .",
    "this effect is tiny for the young @xmath63  myr regions , but produces systematically higher ages for older @xmath64  myr regions .",
    "however , for the oldest of the mystix regions , ngc  2362 , these new age estimates become too high ( over @xmath4  myr on the time scale of @xcite , over 6  myr on the time scale of @xcite ) to be consistent with the published optical ages for ngc  2362 (  [ age_ngc2362_subsection ] ) .",
    "the effect is thus ignored from our further analyses .",
    "the @xmath53 and @xmath1 relationships are astrophysically poorly understood .",
    "one possibility consistent with the saturation limit is that x - ray luminosity scales with surface area because larger stars would allowi more flaring magnetic loops .",
    "another possibility is that the x - ray activity scales with stellar volume allowing more opportunity for a convective dynamo . in both cases ,",
    "the @xmath20 relation arises indirectly from the scaling of mass with radius .",
    "finally , @xmath20 might reflect the early trapping of higher magnetic flux in more massive stars , although it seems unlikely that fully convective stars would be dominated by ` fossil ' magnetic fields rather than by dynamo - generated fields . in any case",
    ", these astrophysical explanations could be too simplistic to reflect reality .",
    "but even without clear scientific understanding for a universal @xmath20 for pre - main sequence stars , this relationship , when calibrated to the taurus sample of @xcite , has considerable predictive power .",
    "the use of poorly understood empirical relationships for calibrating other properties has a long tradition in astronomy : the cepheid p - l relation of @xcite , the @xmath65 relation for main sequence stars of @xcite , the relations involving kinematics and luminosities in galaxies of @xcite and @xcite , and the sn ia light curve relation to @xmath51 widely used today @xcite .",
    "absorption plays an important role in @xmath0 estimation . both the @xmath2 magnitude and the full - band x - ray luminosity",
    "are corrected for absorption for individual stars prior to their placement on the @xmath20 and @xmath17 diagrams .",
    "note that these corrections may not be self - consistent .",
    "the @xmath2 reddening correction is based on the nir color - color diagram and physically arises from scattering and absorption by interstellar dust .",
    "the @xmath12 absorption correction is based on the median energy of observed x - ray photons as a surrogate for soft x - ray absorption by a column density of interstellar gas @xcite .",
    "we have chosen this divided approach , rather than a unified approach , to avoid assuming that the gas - to - dust ratio in interstellar clouds is fixed and known .",
    "but absorption should also play an astronomical role that can help validate the median @xmath0 estimates for mystix subclusters .",
    "we expect that older pms stars will exhibit lower interstellar absorption than the youngest stars , which must reside in their natal dense molecular cores and filaments .",
    "as star formation progresses , older stars may kinematically drift from these obscured regions , cloud material can be depleted through conversion of gas to stars , and cloud material can be photoevaporated and ablated by the radiation and winds of newborn massive stars . a strict relationship between age and absorption",
    "is not expected due to variations in line - of - sight geometries and cloud star formation histories .",
    "since the @xmath5 color index is a reddening indicator that is relatively insensitive to stellar spectral type or protoplanetary disk thermal emission , we expect stellar ages @xmath0 to be anti - correlated with @xmath5 .",
    "we first consider the integrated sample of 5525 mpcm stars averaged over the full fields of mystix msfrs .",
    "these fields are determined by the outline of single or mosaicked exposures of the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ and typically include a well - known rich ob - dominated stellar cluster plus subclusters , embedded young stars , and widely distributed young stars .",
    "most regions have heterogeneous structures with stars ranging from lightly to heavily absorbed .",
    "figure [ fig_agejx_vs_reddening ] shows the @xmath0  vs.  @xmath5 scatter diagram .",
    "note that in the range of @xmath66  mag , the spread in the j - h color is caused by the effect of absorption and the variation in the intrinsic colors of low - mass diskless stars , @xmath67  mag , and disk - bearing stars , @xmath68  mag .",
    "the bottom panel shows the similar scatter diagram using @xmath69 @xcite . due to the wide spread in ages at a chosen absorption",
    ", a standard regression line does not give an effective measure of this relationship .",
    "we apply instead the b - spline quantile regression described by @xcite and implemented within the * r * statistical software system in cran package _ cabs _ @xcite .",
    "the spline fits for the 25% , 50% ( median ) , and 75% quartiles to the @xmath0 values as a function of the @xmath5 absorption indicator are shown in figure [ fig_agejx_vs_reddening ] .",
    "no monotonicity or concavity constraint is imposed , and ` spline knot ' selection is based on the likelihood - based akaike information criterion .    the median @xmath0 regression relationship with @xmath5 is well approximated by two lines : @xmath70    these equations can be used for estimating cluster ages from @xmath5 , provided that the bulk of the reddening is local to the cluster , i.e. , local molecular cloud and circumstellar environments .",
    "a star with @xmath71 , for example , has an estimated age of @xmath72  myr . from the upper and lower quartile curves , we estimate that half of an ensemble of such stars would lie in the range @xmath73  myr .",
    "a heavily absorbed star with @xmath74 has estimated @xmath75  myr with interquartile range @xmath76  myr .",
    "clearly , the prediction for any single star is very uncertain .",
    "the @xmath0 @xmath77 @xmath78 relationship in figure  [ fig_agejx_vs_reddening](b ) favorably compares to a similar relationship recently obtained by @xcite from a disk fraction measurement calibrated to a disk evolution timescale and averaged over several clusters in the rosette molecular cloud .",
    "these two age estimates agree well above @xmath79  mag , but ybarra gets older ages for @xmath80  mag .",
    "the agreement at high absorption is gratifying given the very different approaches taken in the two studies .",
    "the difference at low absorption might be attributed to different methods for obtaining @xmath78 ; we estimate extinction by photometric dereddening as shown in figure  [ fig_jhk_ccd ] , while ybarra et al .",
    "estimate @xmath78 using a reduction in background nir star surface density . in any case",
    ", we note that the ybarra et al .",
    "values lie within our @xmath81%-to-@xmath82% interquartile mystix range , and thus the two estimates are in formal agreement even at low absorption .",
    "as the scatter around the median regression line in figure  [ fig_agejx_vs_reddening ] is smaller , and the agreement with @xcite is better , for @xmath83  mag , we use the regression lines at high absorption ( equations 1 and 2 above ) as a calibration for estimating ages of young , highly reddened subclusters .",
    "this is especially useful in cases of subclusters with poor @xmath0 sampling .",
    "the calibration curve is thus employed as an alternative to the median @xmath0 estimates for highly reddened mystix subclusters ; these new estimates are called @xmath84 in  [ subregions_subclusters_section ] and table  [ tbl_cluster_ages ] .",
    "there are many sources of uncertainties in estimating ages of individual pms stars . here",
    "we ignore ` systematic ' uncertainties that can globally shift age scales , such as errors in the distance to a msfr or errors in the theoretical evolutionary tracks .",
    "the effects of distance uncertainties on the mystix age gradients resulted from our age analysis (  [ results_subsection ] ) are further discussed in ",
    "[ some_advantage_subsection ] .",
    "we concentrate on possible sources of error in @xmath0 that can produce scatter among age estimates of samples that are truly coeval .    for mystix stars , typical photometric errors on @xmath2-band magnitudes ( mostly from ukirt observations )",
    "are @xmath85  mag . from a multi - epoch nir study of nearby star forming regions",
    ", @xcite finds that in the @xmath2-band ` half the objects show variations of 5 - 20 per cent [ 0.05 - 0.2 mag ] ' and ` the other half is not variable ' . based on this work , we assume a typical scatter of @xmath86  mag due to stellar variability . from the nir color - color diagram (  [ dereddening_subsection ] ) , the typical scatter of the @xmath5 color around the taurus locus for the taurus ( above and below the locus ) and the mystix ( below the locus ) stars is @xmath87  mag .",
    "this scatter is likely due to measurement errors , intrinsic imperfection of the locus , and to a lesser extent to abnormal individual extinction for some stars .",
    "this scatter of @xmath88  mag is equivalent to the accuracy of source extinction of @xmath89  mag .",
    "thus , the reddening errors probably exceed or are comparable to the variability errors , which in turn exceed the photometric errors . for the majority of the stars treated here , this reddening uncertainty translates into uncertainties @xmath90  myr ( figure  [ fig_mj_vs_mass_ajfromccd_smooth_medians_v2 ] ) .    the poisson noise and modeling uncertainties on @xmath12 for the mystix @xmath0 stars are about 0.2  dex each for typical mystix stars treated here @xcite .",
    "but the standard deviation of the residuals on the calibration @xmath1 diagram of @xcite is much larger with @xmath91  dex .",
    "recall that multiple factors could contribute to this spread , including x - ray variability , binarity , possible suppression of x - rays by accretion , and intrinsic imperfection of a power law relationship .",
    "this scatter in @xmath1 corresponds to about 50% uncertainty in the mass estimation ( @xmath92 ) which in turn propagates into @xmath93  myr uncertainty on individual stellar ages ( for a typical mystix star with mass around @xmath94  m@xmath30 and age around @xmath95  myr ; figure  [ fig_mj_vs_mass_ajfromccd_smooth_medians_v2 ] ) .",
    "thus , the individual age estimates are expected to be very uncertain , and wide scatter in individual @xmath0 estimates should be present .",
    "application of the @xmath20 transformation is likely the major source of the uncertainty .",

    "this is expected from the individual star results shown in figure  [ fig_agejx_vs_reddening ] and validates the expected trend that younger subclusters are more embedded in molecular material than older subclusters .",
    "2 .   in all mystix regions ,",
    "the unclustered population ( shown as magenta symbols in figures [ fig_age_gradients_orion ] - [ fig_age_gradients_ngc1893 ] ) is older than most of the subcluster populations .",
    "this is most clearly seen in regions with a single dominant cluster : flame nebula , w  40 , and rcw  36 .",
    "this is readily interpreted as the kinematic dispersion of older generations of stars formed in the molecular cloud .",
    "we infer that mystix regions have been forming stars for millions of years before the compact rich clusters we see today were formed .",
    "3 .   in some mystix regions , a coherent spatial gradient in subcluster ages",
    "is seen , consistent with the progression of star formation through the molecular cloud on scales of several parsecs .",
    "this is most clearly seen in the rosette nebula , eagle nebula , ngc  6634 , and ngc  1893 . for a typical region extent of @xmath129",
    "pc and age gradient of @xmath130  myr , we infer a characteristic ` speed ' of 5  km  s@xmath28 for the propagation of star formation through a giant molecular cloud .",
    "in other cases , the subclusters have indistinguishable ages , or have distinct ages in an incoherent spatial pattern .",
    "this is seen in the orion nebula , ngc  2264 , lagoon nebula , ngc  2362 , dr  21 , ngc  6357 , m  17 , and the carina nebula .",

    "the three clusters producing h regions in ngc  6357 appear to be coeval .",
    "cluster formation along the dr  21 filament , about 5 parsecs in length , appears roughly simultaneous .",
    "the subclusters superposed on carina south pillars show a broad ( possibly bimodal ) range of ages ; this could be from contamination by the old distributed population and/or could be consistent with scenarios of triggered star formation proceeding in these clouds for millions of years @xcite . on occasion , a lightly absorbed cluster ( or its portion )",
    "lies projected against a region harboring embedded clusters : the subcluster k in front of the irs 1 cloud in ngc 2264 , the subcluster l in front of the rosette molecular cloud , and the orion nebula cluster in front of omc-1 .",
    "the use of @xmath0 values based on @xmath2 and @xmath12 measurements , rather than other age methods such as an hrd or a cmd derived from visual band observations , is potentially advantageous for a number of reasons :    1 .",
    "@xmath0 estimates can be made for young stars over a wide range of pms evolutionary stages and cloud absorptions .",
    "infrared - only studies , biased towards selection of disk - bearing ysos , are typically restricted to the earlier stages , while optical - only studies are typically restricted to later , lightly - obscured stages .",
    "2 .   compared to optical and mid - infrared surveys where diffuse nebular emission from ionized gas and heated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can be bright , x - ray and nir are subject to less confusion from nebular emission by heated gas and dust .",
    "extinction corrections are much smaller in the @xmath2-band than @xmath131-band ; recall that @xmath132 .",
    "both x - ray and nir surveys penetrate comparably deeper into obscuring material than optical surveys .",
    "this gives a major advantage to @xmath0 estimates in mystix msfrs where absorption can vary by tens of magnitudes between subclusters and individual stars .",
    "multi - epoch photometric surveys have shown that the nir bands are less affected by variability compared to optical bands .",
    "photometric variability can arise either from changes in accretion rates or from magnetic activity .",
    "there will be thus less scatter in estimating intrinsic photospheric luminosities from single - epoch @xmath2 photometry in contrast to single - epoch @xmath131 photometry often used in hrd / cmd studies .",
    "@xcite find that the photometric variability of classical t tauri stars decreases in amplitude @xmath133-fold from @xmath131 to @xmath134 bands .",
    "@xcite find that photometric effects of rotationally modulated spots are typically @xmath135  mag , several times lower than in the @xmath131 band .",
    "similarly , @xcite recommend the @xmath2 band for planetary transit surveys in magnetically active m dwarfs . from a near - infrared study of nearby star forming regions , @xcite",
    "conclude that ` the variability in the j - band is less than 0.5 mag for the overwhelming majority of ysos , i.e. a factor of @xmath136 1.6 in luminosity , which is only a minor part of the observed spread in the hr diagrams ' .",
    "5 .   unlike optical measurements ,",
    "the x - ray luminosity @xmath12 from most msfrs is not detectably affected by accretion variations or emission from accretion shocks .",
    "the soft x - rays from the accretion shock is generally lost due to interstellar absorption .",
    "no causal link is seen between the sources of optical variability ( often accretion related ) and x - ray variability @xcite .",
    "x - ray variability is equally ubiquitous on both diskless and disk - bearing stars and is mainly due to magnetic activity @xcite . the contribution of the ` very soft ' x - ray emission from accretion shocks can only be detected ( and modeled ) in cases where there is negligible soft x - ray absorption , which is not the case for most msfrs . however , although independent of accretion , the x - ray variability does affect the @xmath0 estimates , as detailed in  [ error_propagation_section ] .",
    "cluster ages are often estimated from infrared excess properties . in some studies",
    ", disk - bearing stars are binned into a classification scheme ( class 0 , i , and ii young stellar objects ) that does not have an established calibration to stellar age . in other studies ,",
    "the disk fraction is measured ( often with a poorly established sample of disk - free stars ) and ages are estimated from a rough calibration curve @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the age vs. disk fraction calibration of @xcite seems consistent with the @xmath0 estimates for the highly - absorbed mpcms (  [ reddening_effect_section ] ) . 7 .   unlike some studies where",
    "different age estimation methods are applied to arbitrarily defined regions or ( sub)samples , @xmath0 values are calculated for stellar samples within subclusters defined by a mathematically objective procedure in @xcite .",
    "8 .   unlike some studies where cluster ages are the mean of age or log - age distributions , @xmath0 results reported here",
    "are calculated using median values that are robust to non - gaussianity and unaffected by transformation of the age variable . 9 .",
    "our homogeneous @xmath0 analysis is applied to a large number of star forming regions , whereas most previous studies applied different methods to different regions .",
    "the @xmath0 estimates for over a hundred mystix subclusters are referenced to a uniform time scale , which depends on the @xcite models and the adopted distances to the mystix regions .",
    "this allows reasonably reliable comparison of star formation histories within and between msfrs .",
    "our median @xmath0 estimates for mystix subclusters are listed in table  [ tbl_cluster_ages ] .    however , like most of the other age methods , the @xmath0 method is prone to some problems and limitations :    1 .",
    "our @xmath0 estimates for individual stars are highly uncertain .",
    "the largest contribution to the error is the scatter on the @xmath20 diagram that causes typical @xmath0 uncertainties of @xmath130  myr (  [ error_propagation_section ] ) .",
    "however , scatter of similar amplitude is seen in optically derived ages (  [ individual_ages_section ] ) ; this is the well - known problem of age spreads in young stellar clusters .",
    "we use the robust median estimator that effectively reduces both the influence of outliers and individual star age uncertainties in estimating subcluster ages",
    ". 2 .   for some embedded mystix subclusters the inferred @xmath0 or @xmath84 estimates may overestimate true ages due to the poor sensitivity of the @xmath0 method to very young class  0/i protostars .",
    "our @xmath0 estimates for the individual mystix stars , and hence the median values for subclusters , have not been corrected for possible effects of binarity .",
    "true ages may thus be somewhat older than we state .",
    "this deficiency is shared with most other age estimates at distances of msfrs .",
    "any anomalous dust extinction laws characteristic of some obscured regions of molecular clouds are ignored .",
    "@xmath0 relies on the @xmath20 regression averaged between accreting and non - accreting stars that are known to have different x - ray luminosity functions (  [ lx_mass_pms_section ] ) .",
    "the accreting stars are on average less x - ray active .",
    "but we do not recommend use of the separate regression lines reported by @xcite for a number of reasons .",
    "first , for the typical mass range of the mystix @xmath0 stars , the recent published results on the presence / absence of the effect are controversial (  [ lx_mass_pms_section ] ) .",
    "second , a clear separation between accreting and non - accreting systems is not available for most mystix msfrs .",
    "third , the xphot method for estimating @xmath12 is based on the x - ray emission models already averaged between accreting and non - accreting systems @xcite .",
    "6 .   as for any other age method ,",
    "our age estimates are prone to changes as the distance estimate to a star forming region varies .",
    "figure [ fig_distance_effect ] exemplifies the effect of uncertain distances on the mystix age gradients .",
    "following are a few notable examples of this effect .",
    "+ first , changes in distance estimates will globally shift inferred age scales with larger distances resulting in younger age scales .",
    "second , due to the non - uniform separation and orientation of the theoretical isochrones on the @xmath13 versus @xmath11 diagram ( figure [ fig_mj_vs_mass_ajfromccd_smooth_medians_v2 ] ) and the distance dependence of both @xmath13 and @xmath11 ( through @xmath12 ) quantities , the slopes on the median(@xmath0 ) vs. median(@xmath5 ) plots would generally change with the changing reference distance .",
    "third , distance uncertainties of @xmath10% ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table 1 ) propagate into subcluster age differences of only a few to several percent ( e.g. , orion , rosette , and ngc 1893 in figure [ fig_distance_effect ] ) .",
    "distance uncertainties of @xmath137% , as seen in rcw  38 and the lagoon nebula , propagate into subcluster age differences of @xmath138% .",
    "finally , different distances to subclusters within the same mystix region would likely have negligible effect on the inferred age gradients in the region . for instance , using volumetric assumptions for the nearly circular ngc  1893 and rosette bubbles , it is reasonable to suggest that distance differences to the mystix subclusters in these regions of @xmath139  pc are only @xmath140% of the total distance to the region and give no more than a few percent difference in inferred subcluster ages .",
    "researchers have historically used a number of different methods for dating young stellar clusters : isochrone fitting on the hrd or on photometric cmd , protoplanetary disk fraction , lithium depletion , and other procedures @xcite .",
    "the placement of pms stars on the hrd or cmd with theoretical evolutionary isochrones is probably the most popular method in the literature for dating young ( @xmath141  myr ) clusters but the individual stellar ages are highly uncertain .",
    "the distributions of stellar ages within rich clusters and across large - scale msfrs often show wide age spreads ; it has been unclear whether this is entirely due to poor individual age estimates or to real extended star formation histories .    the problem of age estimation in msfrs is particularly challenging , as reliable censuses of stellar members are hard to obtain and complex star formation histories are likely to be present . the mystix project has produced rich samples in 20 ob - dominated young star forming regions at distances @xmath142  kpc using sensitive x - ray , nir , and mid - infrared photometric catalogs @xcite .",
    "@xcite has segmented the spatial distribution of mystix probable cluster members into dozens of distinct subclusters .",
    "some subclusters are deeply embedded in cloud material and have mostly disk - bearing stars , while others have low obscuration and mostly disk - free stars .",
    "the mystix sample thus provides a valuable opportunity to characterize star formation histories in msfrs where optical or nir spectroscopy is as yet unavailable .    in this work",
    ", we develop a new pms stellar age estimator , @xmath0 , based on @xmath2-band stellar photospheric emission and on x - ray emission from coronal magnetic flaring .",
    "stellar masses are directly derived from absorption - corrected x - ray luminosities using the @xmath1 relation from the taurus cloud .",
    "these masses are combined with @xmath2-band magnitudes , corrected for source extinction and distance , for comparison with pms evolutionary models @xcite to estimate ages .",
    "we provide a homogeneous set of median @xmath0 for over a hundred subclusters identified by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* table  [ tbl_cluster_ages ] ) .",
    "the method has a number of advantages over traditional methods of age estimation for young stellar clusters (  [ some_advantage_subsection ] ) .",
    "the main conclusions of our study are as follows :    1 .",
    "we demonstrate that the @xmath20 relation , rather than the @xmath47 ratio , remains slowly varying during the early pms phase (  [ lx_mass_pms_section ] ) .",
    "the @xmath0 stellar ages are anticorrelated with the source extinction @xmath78 and the @xmath5 color . at high absorptions ,",
    "the @xmath143 relationship is consistent with that of @xcite that was independently derived using disk fraction techniques .",
    "the @xmath0 vs. @xmath5 trend can serve as an approximate age predictor for young , highly reddened clusters , provided that the bulk of the reddening is local to the clusters (  [ reddening_effect_section ] ) .",
    "3 .   to overcome the dispersion of highly uncertain individual ages ,",
    "we compute median ages ( and their confidence intervals ) of stellar samples within subclusters defined by the companion study of @xcite (   [ subregions_subclusters_section ] and [ age_gradients_section ] ) .",
    "we find narrowly constrained ages for these spatially distinct structures .",
    "thus , we establish that ( at least some ) of the apparent age spread in msfrs is real and can be attributed to clusters formed at different times .",
    "4 .   spatial gradients in subcluster ages are often seen , consistent with astronomically reasonable patterns of star formation histories with older lightly absorbed structures on one side , younger heavily absorbed structures on the other side , and intermediate - age structures in between .",
    "some regions do not show coherent star formation patterns . however , widely distributed populations nearly always have older ages than the principal clusters .",

    "our @xmath0 values are consistent with these estimates .",
