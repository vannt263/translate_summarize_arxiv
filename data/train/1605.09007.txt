    "the search for ferromagnetic superconductors ( fmscs ) can be trace back to before the 1960s@xcite . owing to the antagonistic nature of superconductivity ( sc ) and ferromagnetism ( fm)@xcite",
    ", sc rarely coexists with fm , even for that sc and fm emerge in different subsystems of a complex crystalline lattice .",
    "it was not until late 1970s that both sc and fm were observed in errh@xmath0b@xmath0 , but sc _ disappears _ when the er magnetic ordering sets in@xcite .",
    "since then , a few ` conventional magnetic superconductors ' were discovered@xcite , in which sc and local - moment fm ( or more frequently , other types of magnetic orderings with ferromagnetic components ) casually coexist in certain temperature and magnetic regimes . such materials were earlier called fmscs@xcite , and this terminology was also employed for the uranium compounds uge@xmath2 , uruge and ucoge that are superconducting well below their curie temperatures@xcite . here we adopt the classification@xcite , which gives another terminology , ` superconducting ferromagnet ' , for the case that the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3 is lower than the curie temperature @xmath4 . whilst fmsc is reserved for the scenario of @xmath5 .",
    "note that , in the u - based superconducting ferromagnets , sc and fm share the same type of electrons , and the sc is widely believed to be in a spin - triplet state . for a spin - singlet superconductor ,",
    "however , sc is more easily destroyed by the strong exchange fields in a ferromagnet . at the same time , a spin - singlet @xmath6-wave superconducting state does not allow a local - moment fm via ruderman - kittel - kasuya - yosida ( rkky ) interactions@xcite .",
    "therefore , it seems impossible for a single material to host both local - moment fm and spin - singlet sc ( fm+sc ) .",
    "however , the fm+sc - like phenomenon was observed@xcite , and recently confirmed by x - ray resonant magnetic scattering@xcite and neutron scattering@xcite , in the p - doped eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 system in which sc emerges at @xmath726 k followed by ferromagnetic ordering at @xmath717 k for the eu@xmath1 spins .",
    "similar phenomena were later demonstrated in other doped eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 systems@xcite . nevertheless , strong experimental evidence of bulk sc in the doped eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 systems is still lacking .",
    "also there have been debates on the nature of eu - spin ordering@xcite .",
    "very recently , motivated by our previous material design@xcite as well as the latest experimental progress@xcite , we succeeded in synthesizing a new eu - containing iron arsenide rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 which exhibits bulk sc at @xmath3 = 36.5 k and eu - spin fm at @xmath4 = 15 k@xcite .",
    "the robustness of both sc and fm indicates a genuine fm+sc state realized .",
    "here we report the second robust fmsc , cseufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , a sister compound of rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "the new material shows bulk sc at 35.2 k and eu - spin fm at 15.5 k. an additional anomaly at 5 k is observed , possibly associated with the interplay between sc and fm .",
    "another interesting issue is that the eu - spin ferromagnetic ordering is of a rare third order , suggesting a strong two - dimensional character of the ferromagnetic transition .",
    "cseufe@xmath0as@xmath0 polycrystalline sample was synthesized by solid - state reactions in a sealed vacuum , with procedures similar to the synthesis of rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "first , csas , euas and feas were prepared respectively via the reactions of cs ( 99.75% ) , eu ( 99.9% ) and as ( 99.999% ) pieces with fe powders ( 99.999% ) .",
    "the intermediate products were then ball milled separately for 10 minutes in a glove box filled with pure ar ( the water and oxygen content is below 1 ppm ) .",
    "second , the powder of csas , euas , feas and fe was weighed in a stoichiometric ratio .",
    "the mixture was homogenized by grinding , pressed into pellet , and then loaded in an alumina tube which was sealed by arc welding in argon atmosphere in a ta tube .",
    "the welded ta tube was jacketed in a quartz ampoule filled with ar gas ( @xmath70.6 bar ) , followed by heating the ampoule to 1123 - 1173 k , holding for 6 hours , in a muffle furnace .",
    "the sample was quenched after the high - temperature chemical reactions .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was carried out at room temperature on a panalytical x - ray diffractometer ( model empyrean ) with a monochromatic cuk@xmath8 radiation . to avoid severe preferred orientations ,",
    "the powder was pressed softly on the sample holder .",
    "the lattice parameters and the atomic positions were refined by a rietveld analysis using a rietan - fp software @xcite .",
    "the electrical and heat - capacity measurements were conducted on a physical property measurement system ( ppms-9 , quantum design ) .",
    "the electrical resistivity was measured using a standard four - electrode method .",
    "the as - prepared cseufe@xmath0as@xmath0 pellet was cut into a thin rectangular bar , on which gold wires were attached with silver paint .",
    "the hall coefficient was measured by permutating the voltage and current electrodes under 8 t@xcite , using a thin - square sample ( 2.2@xmath92.0@xmath90.17 mm@xmath10 ) with four symmetric electrodes attached .",
    "the heat capacity was measured by a thermal relaxation method using a square - shaped sample plate with a total mass of 16.8 mg .",
    "the dc magnetization was measured in a magnetic property measurement system ( mpms-5 , quantum design ) using a regular shape sample so that the demagnetization factor can be estimated more precisely .",
    "the powder xrd pattern of the cseufe@xmath0as@xmath0 sample can be well indexed with a rbcafe@xmath0as@xmath0-type@xcite ( 1144-type ) primitive tetragonal lattice .",
    "no evident impurity phase can be identified .",
    "1 shows the rietveld refinement profile based on the 1144-type structure shown in the inset .",
    "the refinement yields a weighted reliable factor @xmath11 of 4.80@xmath12 and a `` goodness - of - fit '' parameter @xmath13 of 1.48 , and the resulting crystallographic parameters are tabulated in table  [ structure ] .",
    "the inset shows the crystal structure.,title=\"fig:\",width=302 ] [ fig1 ]    isostructural to rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , cseufe@xmath0as@xmath0 can be viewed as an intergrowth of csfe@xmath2as@xmath2 and eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 , thus it is meaningful to compare their crystal structures .",
    "the @xmath14 axis is almost the same ( within the determination uncertainty ) as the average value of those of eufe@xmath2as@xmath2@xcite and csfe@xmath2as@xmath2@xcite .",
    "in fact , the lattice mismatch between the two 122-type compounds is only 0.4% , which possibly plays an important role for the formation of cseufe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath15 axis is 0.010(1 ) larger that the sum of one half of the @xmath15 axes of csfe@xmath2as@xmath2 and eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 .",
    "this result looks abnormal because in general the @xmath15 axis of the hybrid phase should be shortened ( as indeed seen in rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0@xcite ) , in order to stabilize the intergrowth compound .",
    "one may examine the lattice changes in each crystalline  block \" .",
    "the thickness of the ",
    "csfe@xmath2as@xmath2 `` block is almost identical , while the ' ' eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 \" block is slightly stretched from 6.068 to 6.082 .",
    "this small change contrasts with the case in rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 where the  rbfe@xmath2as@xmath2 \" block is appreciably compressed@xcite .",

    "this means that some sort of negative chemical pressures exist in cseufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , or equivalently speaking , positive chemical pressures are present in rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",
    "note that the fe coordination in rbeufe@xmath0as@xmath0 is asymmetric , characterized by obviously unequal fe@xmath25as1 and fe@xmath25as2 bondlengths . here for cseufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , however , the fe@xmath25as1 and fe@xmath25as2 bondlengths are almost equal .",
    "consequently , as1 ( close to cs ) and as2 ( nearby eu ) heights from the fe plane are both 1.36(1 )  , and the bond angles as1@xmath25fe@xmath25as1 and as2@xmath25fe@xmath25as2 are 110.3(2)@xmath26 . in comparison ,",
    "the as@xmath25fe@xmath25as angles of csfe@xmath2as@xmath2 and eufe@xmath2as@xmath2 are 109.6@xmath26 and 106.8@xmath26 , respectively .",
    "this indicates that , although there is no lattice shrinkage in cseufe@xmath0as@xmath0 , the local structure of fe@xmath2as@xmath2 layers is  homogenized \" , which may account for the lattice stabilization .      figure 2(a ) shows the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity [ @xmath27 and hall coefficient [ @xmath28 for the cseufe@xmath0as@xmath0 polycrystalline sample .",
    "the normal - state @xmath29 curve displays an unusual metallic behavior characterized by a broad hump at @xmath7 150 k. the broad hump seems to be a common feature of hole - doped iron - based superconductors@xcite .",
    "indeed , the normal - state hall coefficient @xmath30 is positive with a value of 6 @xmath9 10@xmath31 cm@xmath10 c@xmath33 at room temperature .",
    "if assuming a single - band model , the @xmath34 value corresponds to 0.54 holes / fe , more than twice of the expected value ( 0.25 ) from charge balance .",
    "this discrepancy probably comes from the electron - hole compensation effect because there are multiple bands in the system@xcite .",
    "note that @xmath30 also shows a hump at around 150 k , suggesting a crossover in electronic properties .",
    "this phenomenon is similar to those in heavily hole - doped @xmath35fe@xmath2as@xmath2 ( @xmath35 = k , rb and cs ) which is revealed as an emergent kondo lattice behavior very recently@xcite .",

    "the upper critical fields , @xmath38 , are obtained by defining @xmath39 as the temperature at which the resistivity drops to 90% of the extrapolated normal - state value .",

    "figure 3 shows the temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility [ @xmath47 in zfc and fc modes under @xmath48 = 10 oe .",
    "a sharp diamagnetic transition occurs at @xmath36 = 35.2 k , consistent with the above electrical measurement .",
    "the volume fraction of magnetic shielding achieves 95% at 2 k , after the correction of demagnetization effect , and the volume fraction of magnetic repulsion reaches 23% at @xmath725 k , indicating bulk sc in cseufe@xmath0as@xmath0 .",

    "the upturn in @xmath53 above @xmath4 = 15.5 k seems to be due to strong two - dimensional correlations ( see the specific - heat result below ) , while the drop in @xmath53 below @xmath4 could be due to an antiferromagnetic coupling between the ferromagnetic domains .",
    "additionally , we find a novel bifurcation of fcc ( measured in cooling process ) and fch ( measured in heating process )",

    "= 30 k , just below @xmath3 , a typical superconducting loop appears , superimposing on the paramagnetic background .",
    "when the temperature is further decreased to 20 k , which is close to @xmath4 , the paramagnetic signals turn into a shape of brillouin function , and the superconducting - like hysteresis loop is more obvious .",
    "below @xmath4 , the @xmath54 curves overall look like a ferromagnetic hysteresis loop , but it does not merge at higher magnetic fields ( above the saturation field , @xmath55 ) .",
    "the latter phenomenon is clearly seen in the left inset of fig .",
    "this is exactly due to the existence of sc that gives rise to a flux pinning effect .",
    "note that the saturation magnetization at 2 k is only 5.9 @xmath56/eu , somewhat smaller than the expected value of @xmath57 = 7.0 @xmath56/eu for the full eu@xmath1-spin ferromagnetic alignment .",

    "this large @xmath70 value naturally explains the extraordinarily high specific heat beyond the dulong - petit limit at high temperatures , since the electronic specific heat contributes 39 j k@xmath33 mol@xmath33 at 300 k. as for the ferromagnetic transition , the expected jump for a second - order phase transition is absent at @xmath4 .",
