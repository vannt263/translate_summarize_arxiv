    "the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) strongly suggests new physics at tev scale , and the idea that there exists extra dimensions ( ed ) which first proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali@xcite might provide a solution to this problem .",
    "they proposed a scenario in which the sm field is constrained to the common 3 + 1 space - time dimensions (  brane \" ) , while gravity is free to propagate throughout a larger multidimensional space @xmath7 (  bulk \" ) .",
    "the picture of a massless graviton propagating in d dimensions is equal to the picture that numerous massive kaluza - klein ( kk ) gravitons propagate in 4 dimensions .",
    "the fundamental planck scale @xmath8 is related to the plank mass scale @xmath9 according to the formula @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the size and number of the extra dimensions , respectively .",
    "if @xmath11 is large enough to make @xmath8 on the order of the electroweak symmetry breaking scale ( @xmath13 ) , the hierarchy problem will be naturally solved , so this extra dimension model is called the large extra dimension model ( led ) or the add model .",
    "postulating @xmath8 to be 1 tev , we get @xmath14 for @xmath15 , which is obviously ruled out since it would modify newton s law of gravity at solar - system distances ; and we get @xmath16 for @xmath17 , which is also ruled out by the torsion - balance experiments@xcite . when @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , it is possible to detect graviton signal at high energy colliders .",
    "both the atlas and cms collaborations have reported a sm higgs - like excess at around @xmath20 gev . if a sm - like higgs particle is discovered in this particular mass range , an important additional test of the sm electroweak symmetry breaking sector is the measurement of the higgs self - interactions . at hadron colliders ,",
    "the pair production of higgs bosons plays a distinctive role in understanding the higgs mechanism@xcite . as the triple self - coupling of higgs particles",
    "is involved in such production thus provide the experimental reconstruction of the higgs potential .",
    "precise measurement of this coupling could therefore give more insight on the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "compared to that of a single higgs boson production , the signal - to - background ratio could significantly improved .",
    "the invariant mass scale of the single higgs production is fixed by the higgs mass , of order only @xmath21 125 gev .",
    "thus their detection through heavy quark decay modes suffer from large qcd backgrounds .",
    "further more , the higgs pair production can give various final states , depending on the decay modes of the higgs boson .",
    "in the mass range of ( 120,130)gev , the higgs boson decay modes with the largest branching fractions are @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the most probable decay mode for a pair of higgs bosons is @xmath24 .",
    "however , this mode is challenging to search for due to the fact that it is difficult to trigger on , and that it competes against the qcd multi - jet backgrounds that possess overwhelmingly large cross sections .",
    "in general , qcd backgrounds can be suppressed with the existence of leptons and missing energy . in the sm frame ,",
    "the promising channels are @xmath25@xcite and @xmath26@xcite for @xmath27 gev .",
    "more detail analysis can be found later .",
    "another important distinctive feature of the higgs pair production at the lhc is that the effects of physics beyond the sm can remarkably enhance the cross section with respect to that of the sm .",
    "phenomenological studies of higgs pair production have thus been performed in the context of the fourth generation model@xcite , the littlest higgs model@xcite and the universal extra dimensions model@xcite . for the large extra dimensional models ,",
    "the tree level diagrams mediated by the kaluza - klein gravitons lead to a large total cross section .",
    "such new theoretical approaches have drawn extensive attention in ref@xcite for a comparison between supersymmetry and led models .",
    "exchange of virtual kk graviton or emission of a real kk mode could give rise to interesting phenomenological signals at tev scale@xcite .",
    "virtual effects of kk modes could lead to the enhancement of the cross section of pair productions in processes , for example , di - lepton , di - gauge boson ( @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) , dijet , @xmath31 pair@xcite etc",
    ". some of these calculations have also been expanded into nlo qcd loop level .",
    "a detailed calculation of higgs pair production in led model has been performed recently@xcite , however , the qcd loop induced calculation based on the led context is still missing .",
    "experimentally , the cms collaboration has performed a lot of search for led on different final states at @xmath32 tev@xcite . by combining the diphoton , dimuon and dielectron channels , lower limits",
    "are set on the effective planck scale in the range of 2.3@xmath213.8 tev at the 95@xmath33 confidence level@xcite .",
    "these limits are the most restrictive bounds on virtual graviton exchange up to date . based on the analysis of 5 @xmath34 of data at the lhc ,",
    "the atlas@xcite and cms@xcite collaborations have presented evidence for a higgs boson with a mass in the 125 gev range .",
    "we thus concentrate on the 125 gev higgs pair production related to the latest measurement with the effects of the led models and find the characteristic distribution of it up to qcd loop induced level .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we present a brief introduction to the related theory . in section 3",
    "we present the main contribution to the process and section 3 is arranged to present the numerical results of our studies .",
    "finally we summarize the results in the last section .",
    "the led model consists of the gravity sector and the sm sector .",
    "the manifold which gravity propagates , is not the ordinary 4 dimensional spacetime manifold , but r4@xmath35 m , where m is a @xmath12-torus with radius @xmath11 and volume @xmath36 without loss of physical significance . in our calculation we use the de donder gauge .",
    "the relevant feynman rules involving spin-2 kk graviton and the relevant vertices in the led model can be found in ref@xcite .",
    "we denote the process as : @xmath37 where @xmath38 denotes the kaluza - klein(kk ) gravitons .",
    "the couplings between gravitons and sm particles are proportional to a constant named gravitational coupling @xmath39 , which can be expressed in terms of the fundamental scale @xmath8 and the size of the compactified space radius r by @xmath40 . in practical experiments ,",
    "the contributions of the different kk modes have to be summed up , so the propagator is proportional to @xmath41 , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the mass of the kk state @xmath44 .",
    "when the effects of all the kk states are taken together , the amplitude is proportional to @xmath45 . if @xmath46 this summation is formally divergent as @xmath43 becomes large .",
    "we assume that the distribution has a ultraviolet cutoff at @xmath47 , where the underlying theory becomes manifest .",
    "then @xmath48 can be expressed as : @xmath49.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the imaginary part i(@xmath50 ) is from the summation over the many non - resonant kk states and its expression can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "finally the kk graviton propagator after summing over the kk states is : @xmath51    by adding all the feynman rules in the led model and the propagator given above , we can get the amplitudes(@xmath52 ) for the sm and virtual kk graviton exchange contributions as well as their interferences .",
    "the cross section integral for hadron - hadron collisions can be written as @xmath53 where @xmath54 represent the gluon or ( anti)quark parton density functions , @xmath55 indicate ( anti)proton , @xmath56 is the factorization scale which can be chosen equal the renormalization scale @xmath57 when the loop calculation is included .",

    "typically the latest new parton distributions for collider physics ct10@xcite has been used in our calculation .",
    "the n - body phase space differential @xmath61 and its integral @xmath67 depend only on @xmath68 and particle masses @xmath69 due to lorentz invariance : @xmath70 with i and j denoting the incident particles and k running over all outgoing particles(k = 1, ...",

    "we separate the total contributions into two parts .",

    "[ fig1](a , b , c ) for more details .",

    "[ fig1](c ) which are similar thus not shown , totally ten feynman diagrams contribute .",
    "contributions from the quark - antiquark collision can be safely omitted in the light fermion mass limits except b - b fusion through t - channels .",
    "however , it is only less of 0.5 percent of gluon - gluon fusion contribution@xcite , and not considered here .",
    "thus we can define this contribution as @xmath73 .",
    "now let s see the second part : contributions to the led effects @xmath72 .",
    "several distinct contributions contribute to this part , include both the tree level and qcd loop induced level .",
    "we separate and highlight them into four different parts :     the qcd one - loop feynman diagrams for the partonic process @xmath74 ( a)-(d ) and the counter term diagrams(e ) correspond to fig.[fig1](d ) , where q represents u-,d-,c-,s- , b- and t - quark while @xmath38 represents spin-2 kk graviton . ]    * the tree level contributions defined as @xmath75 which include both the quark - antiquark collision and gluon - gluon fusion contributions , see fig.[fig1](d , e ) , directly connected by the effects of kk excitation of gravitons .",
    "there are two gravitational vertices thus such contributions are in the effective order @xmath76 . * the @xmath77 level one - loop virtual corrections to the leading order process as well as the renormalization of the leading order cross section which we define as @xmath78 .",
    "the qcd loop level feynman diagrams of the quark - antiquark collision initial state part can be found in fig.[fig2 ] , totally 4 loop diagrams and 1 counterterm diagram , while the gluon - gluon fusion contributions can be found in fig.[fig3 ] with 13 loop diagrams and 1 counterterm diagram as well .",
    "these contributions are in the effective order @xmath79 . * the sm one - loop prediction interference to the leading order process which defined as @xmath80 .",
    "these contributions are in the order @xmath81 .",
    "we keep these contributions for a fully consideration and it may also interesting to see how large are these contributions . *",
    "finally the real gluon and quark emission contributions .",
    "the feynman diagrams can be found in fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "the cross sections are defined as @xmath82 which are also in the order @xmath79 .",
    "we denote these parts by : @xmath83 and @xmath84    refer to emission process related to quark - quark collision and gluon - gluon fusion sub - processes , respectively .",
    "the qcd one - loop feynman diagrams for the partonic process @xmath85 ( a)-(m ) and the counter term diagrams(n ) correspond to fig.[fig1](e ) , where q represents u-,d-,c-,s- , b- and t - quark while @xmath38 represents spin-2 kk graviton . ]",
    "the tree - level feynman diagrams for the real gluon / light-(anti)quark emission subprocess @xmath86 related to eq.[qqemission](1)[fig.(a)-(d ) ] , @xmath87 related to eq.[qqemission](2,3)[fig.(e)-(g ) ] , @xmath88 related to eq.[ggemission](1)[fig.(h)-(k ) ] , @xmath89 related to eq.[ggemission](2,3)[fig.(l ) ] , where q represents u-,d-,c-,s- , b- and t - quark while @xmath38 represents spin-2 kk graviton . ]    finally , we write the total cross section as sum of the above definitions to the formula below : @xmath90    the reason to do this is to introduce the symbolic notations we use later and make it convenient for our numerical calculations .",
    "eq.[3.3 ] means we separate the total contributions into two parts .",

    "eq.[3.5 ] and eq.[3.6 ] related to the quark - antiquark collision and gluon - gluon fusion contributions .",
    "both are summed by two parts .",
    "one is the born level contributions the other are the loop induced led contributions where we use @xmath91 to notate .",
    "we use @xmath92 and @xmath93 to keep notation of eq.[3.5 ] and [ 3.6 ] , respectively .",
    "finally , we define the sm prediction plus the leading order led contributions as @xmath94 and the other terms are the shifted terms coming from the loop induced led effects , see eq.[3.8 ] .",
    "there exist uv and soft / collinear ir singularities in the calculations of @xmath95 . to remove the uv divergences , we need only the wave function renormalization constants for the quark and gluon fields .",
    "we introduce the renormalization constants @xmath96 for massless quark ( q = u , d , c , s , b ) fields and @xmath97 for the gluon field defined as @xmath98    in the modified minimal subtraction ( @xmath99 ) renormalization scheme the renormalization constants for the massless quarks are expressed as @xmath100    in the above equations @xmath57 is the renormalization scale , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 corresponds to the six flavor quarks ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 ) , whereas @xmath111 is the number of the massless quarks ( @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath108 , @xmath107 , @xmath110 ) .",

    "singularities are regulated .",
    "divergences arising from soft gluon emission removed by combining virtual and real emission corrections @xmath114 .",
    "singularities associated with initial state collinear gluon emission are absorbed into the definition of the parton distribution functions .",
    "we employ the @xmath99 scheme for the parton distributions functions .",
    "similar to the virtual part , we utilize dimensional regularization to control the singularities of the radiative corrections , which are organized using the two cutoff phase space slicing(tcpss ) method@xcite .",
    "we adopt tcpss to isolate the ir singularities by introducing two cutoff parameters @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "an arbitrary small @xmath115 separates the three - body final state phase space into two regions : the soft region ( @xmath117 ) and the hard region ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the @xmath116 separates hard region into the hard collinear ( @xmath119 ) region and hard noncollinear ( @xmath120 ) region .",
    "the criterion for separating the hc region is described as follows : the region for real gluon / light-(anti)quark emission with @xmath121 ( or @xmath122 ) @xmath123 ( where @xmath124 ) is called the @xmath119 region .",
    "otherwise it is called the @xmath120 region . then the cross section for each of the real emission partonic processes can be written as @xmath125    after combining all these contributions above , the uv and ir singularities in @xmath126 are exactly canceled .",
    "dependence on the arbitrary small cutoff parameters @xmath115 and @xmath116 are exactly vanished .",
    "these cancelations can be verified numerically in our numerical calculations .",
    "we use feynarts to create the amplitudes and formcalc to perform the numerical calculation . to compute the one - loop tensor integrals we use our modified looptools @xcite which supply an automatic numerical checks for the inferared(ir ) divergence and cross check with oneloop@xcite at enough random phase space points .",
    "in the sm frame , given the small total cross section , it is clear that even for @xmath127 tev and a target luminosity of @xmath128(@xmath129 ) one need to focus on the higgs decay channels with the largest branching ratios to visible final states to observe @xmath130 such as @xmath131 , @xmath132 , @xmath133@xcite .",

    "ref@xcite claimed with 57 signal and 119 background events at @xmath138 by employing new techniques and assuming good @xmath139 reconstruction efficiency(@xmath140 ) , thus make such channel a promising one .",
    "as can be seen , though challenge , higgs pair production in sm can be measured . what s more , we hope to concentrate on the higgs pair production under led frame and find out whether this production can be enhanced and given more chance to be tested .    in the numerical calculations , we take the input parameters as @xmath141 , @xmath142@xcite , @xmath143 , @xmath144@xcite .",

    ", we display a random phase space point as well as the cancelation for different divergent parameters , see in table[tab1 ] .",
    "one thing that should be emphasized is @xmath146 should include the conterterm contributions as well as the soft and collinear singularity terms coming from the hard emission .",
    "we implement this into our monte carlo codes which supply an automatic check of the dependence on these divergence parameters .",
    "we can see the uv and ir divergence can be canceled at high precision level in all the phase space , thus leading the continuance of our following calculation .",

    "notice that in the loop terms , we include the conterterm contribution as well as the soft and collinear singularity terms coming from the hard emission contributions . [ cols=\"^ \" , ]",
    "in this work , we present the a full treatment of the qcd loop induced corrections to the 125 gev neutral higgs pair production process @xmath147 at the early ( @xmath148 tev ) and future ( @xmath127 tev ) lhc in the context of large - extra - dimensions(led ) model including the kaluza - klein(kk ) excited gravitons .",
