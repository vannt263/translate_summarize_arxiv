    "the high mass x - ray binary source hmxrb source oao 1657 - 415 ( oao 1653 - 40 ) was first detected by the copernicus satellite ( polidan et al .",
    "1978 ) in the 4 - 9 kev range .",
    "the heao-1 observations also showed 38.22 sec pulsations in the 1 - 40 kev and 40 - 80 kev bands ( white @xmath1 pravdo 1979 , byrne et al .",
    "observations with ginga and granat ( kamata et al .",
    "1990 , gilfanov et al .",
    "1991 , mereghetti et al .",
    "1991 , sunyaev et al .",
    "1991 ) have found pulse period changes .",
    "batse observations of this source with the compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) showed that oao 1657 - 415 is in an @xmath2 binary orbit with an x - ray eclipse by the a stellar companion ( chakrabarty et al .",
    "the observed orbital parameters imply that the companion is a supergiant of spectral class b0-b6 .",
    "the correlations between x - ray flux and pulse frequency derivatives ( @xmath3 ) fluctuations were investigated by using the previously published pulse frequencies and batse measurements ( baykal 1997 ) .",
    "these correlations suggested that the formation of episodic accretion disks in the case of a stellar wind is the possible accretion mechanism .    in this paper , we present the short term pulse frequency fluctuations and x - ray fluxes of oao 1657 - 415 in the light of recent rxte observations .",
    "we have employed background subtraction by using the background models for the rxte / pca instrument and galactic ridge emission in the 2 - 50 kev range . our x - ray flux and pulse frequency measurements find an increase in the x - ray flux which is correlated with the decrease in the spin - down rate ( or marginal spin - up trend ) .",
    "oao 1657 - 415 was observed between 1997 august 20 - 27 within the guest observer program of rxte with proposal observation i d 20113 .",
    "rxte pointings of the source are separated from each other by approximately six hours with a total observation span of 75 ksec .",
    "the results presented here are based on data collected with the proportional counter array ( pca , jahoda et al . , 1996 ) and the high energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte , rothschild , et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "the pca instrument consists of an array of 5 proportional counters operating in the 260 kev energy range , with a total effective area of approximately 7000 @xmath4 and a field of view @xmath5 fwhm .",
    "the hexte instrument consists of two independent clusters of detectors , each cluster containing four nai(t1)/csi(na ) phoswich scintillation counters sharing a common @xmath5 fwhm field of view . the field of view of each cluster is switched on and off source to provide background measurements .",
    "the net open area of the seven detectors is 1400 @xmath4 and each detector covers the energy range 15250 kev .",
    "background light - curves and pulse height amplitudes are generated by using the background estimator models based upon the rate of very large events ( vle ) , spacecraft activation and cosmic x - ray emission with the standard pca analysis tools .",
    "the background light - curves are subtracted from the source light - curve obtained from the good xenon event data ( fig .",
    "since the source is close to the galactic center , galactic ridge data were extracted from archival rxte observations .",
    "observations pointed at directions a few degrees away from the source are collected .",
    "the background spectra for the galactic ridge data were generated using pca analysis tools .",
    "after the instrument background are removed from the galactic ridge data , the residual spectra are used as a background for the x - ray spectra of oao 1657 - 415 .",
    "the source spectrum was calculated using the same pca background estimator models .",
    "( it should be noted that @xmath6 @xmath7 systematic errors are used in spectral fitting of pca data ) . for the hexte data the background subtraction is straightforward since the hexte detectors are rocking in 16 sec intervals .",
    "standard ftools software for rxte is used for the data reduction and for the dead time correction .",
    "we have used power - laws with high energy cut - off models together with a 6.65 kev gaussian emission line which was found in previous ginga observations ( kamata et al . ,",
    "we have found no evidence for any deviation from a power - law model with high energy cut off which might be attributable to a cyclotron feature .",
    "table 1 presents the spectral parameters of x - ray spectra .",
    "figure 2 presents the joint x - ray spectra of rxte / pca and hexte detectors . the power - law index , and the cut - off and e - folding energies are significantly different from those measured by ginga , the powerlaw steeper , but extending to higher energy . the broader energy band of the pca and hexte combination better constrain the higher energy spectra , but the spectrum may vary intrinsically .",
    "the background subtracted light - curves are corrected with respect to the barycenter of the solar system . using the binary orbital parameters of oao 1657 - 415 from batse observations ( bildsten et al . , 1997 ) , the light curves are also corrected for binary motion of oao 1657 - 415 ( see table 2 ) . a long power spectrum was used to estimate the average pulse frequency .",
    "this pulse frequency is consistent with batse pulse frequency records at the same time ( obtained through heasarc http : cossc.gsfc.nasa.gov ) . in order to resolve the pulse arrival times and pulse frequencies at",
    "shorter time scales 29 pulse arrival times were generated ( one pulse arrival time for each rxte orbit ) .",
    "pulse arrival times are found by folding the light - curve data into one average pulse for each rxte orbit , folding all light - curves into one master pulse , and cross - correlating the master pulse with each of the 29 average pulses . in the pulse timing anaysis , we have used the method of harmonic representation of pulse profiles , as proposed by deeter @xmath8 boynton ( 1985 ) . in this method , pulse profiles are expressed in terms of harmonic series and cross - correlated with the master pulse profile .",
    "the maximum value of the cross - correlation is analytically well defined and does not depend on the phase binning of the pulses .",
    "the master pulse with 40 phase bins was represented by their harmonics ( deeter @xmath8 boynton 1985 ) and cross - correlated with harmonic representations of pulse profiles from segments of the data .",
    "the pulse profiles for oao 1657 - 415 are variable .",
    "this affects the pulse timing . in order to estimate the errors in the arrival times , the light - curve of each rxte orbit",
    "is divided into approximately 10 - 15 equal subsets and new arrival times are estimated .",
    "the average variance in the arrival times are computed and treated as errors of arrival times .",
    "the pulse arrival times are represented in fig .",
    "3 . the residual pulse arrival times may arise from the change of the pulse frequency during the observation ( or intrinsic pulse frequency derivative ) and from the errors of obital parameters ( deeter et al . , 1981 ) , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the pulse phase offset deduced from the pulse timing analysis , @xmath11 is the mid - time of the observation , @xmath12 is the phase offset at t@xmath13 , @xmath14 is the deviation from the mean pulse frequency ( or additive correction to the pulse frequency ) , and @xmath15 is the pulse frequency derivative of the source , @xmath16 is the light travel time for projected semimajor axis , @xmath17 is the epoch when the mean orbital longitude is equal to 90 degrees , @xmath18 is the orbital period , @xmath19 denotes the errors of these parameters , @xmath20 is the mean orbital longitude at @xmath21 .",
    "the above expression is fitted to the pulse arrival times data .",
    "table 2 presents the timing solution of oao 1657 - 415 from our rxte observations .",
    "the pulse frequency derivative obtained from the quadratic trend of the pulse timing analysis is @xmath22 hz s@xmath23 .",
    "the average pulse frequency derivative we deduce from the pulse frequency history of batse archival data is @xmath24 hz s@xmath23 , consistent at the 1@xmath25 level .",
    "the pulse frequency records of oao 1657 - 415 have shown that the source has stochastic spin - up / down trends ( baykal 1997 , bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) at timescales longer than weeks . in intervals between stochastic changes ,",
    "1657 - 415 shows secular spin - up or down trends with lower values of noise strength ( baykal 1997 ) .",
    "our observations detect the source spinning down , on average .",
    "there are local deviations from quadratic trends which can be interpreted as very short term fluctuations ( see fig .",
    "the torque noise analysis of oao 1657 - 415 from the batse observations ( baykal 1997 ) showed that pulse frequency fluctuations at shorter than @xmath26 days are almost not detectable due to the measuremental noise , however rxte observations are yielding significant fluctuations around the average quadratic trend ( or spin - down rate ) , as shown in fig .",
    "3 . in rxte observations we are able to construct pulses for time intervals as short as a few hundred seconds .",
    "this yields better timing at shorter time scales .",
    "therefore the fluctuations in arrival times less than @xmath26 days are resolved .",
    "the x - ray flux and pulse frequency derivative correlations of oao 1657 - 415 were investigated by using batse archival data base ( baykal 1997 ) .",
    "batse pulse flux at 20 - 60 kev and pulse frequency series have shown no correlation between x - ray flux and pulse frequency derivatives .",
    "a strong correlation between specific angular momentum ( l ) and pulse frequency derivatives was found instead .",
    "these correlations implied that the specific angular momentum is directional , sometimes positive and sometimes negative ( @xmath27 l ) , and that sometimes the flow is radial .",
    "these results suggested the formation of temporary accretion disks in the case of stellar wind accretion and the short term disk reversals are quite possible . in the analysis of batse data ,",
    "the shortest time scales for resolving the significant pulse frequency fluctuations were of the order of 8 days .    in the present work , in order to resolve pulse frequencies at shorter time scales , we used high counting statistics of rxte / pca detectors and obtained pulse arrival times at approximately six hours intervals .",
    "for each 4 or 5 pulse arrival times , we fitted a straight line segment and using the slope of this line we estimated a correction to the average pulse frequency ( @xmath28 ) . in this way , we obtained pulse frequency records for each day roughly . in fig .",
    "4 we present the pulse frequency records estimated in this work .",
    "we accumulated the spectral data at 2 - 50 kev , corresponding to observations of pulse arrival times . in each set of observations we fitted a power - law with high energy cut - off with a gaussian emission line",
    ", then we estimate unabsorbed flux ( or intrinsic pulsar flux ) .",
    "5 presents the pulsar flux history during the rxte observations . during the observation , bolometric x - ray flux increased roughly by 70@xmath7 .",
    "the spin - down rate is decreased and a marginal spin - up trend is seen .",
    "this is the first evidence in oao 1657 - 415 to show positive marginal correlation between the x - ray flux and pulse frequency changes .",
    "oao 1657 - 415 , has shown strong spin - up / down torques in its time history which can not be explained by wind accretion ( baykal 1997 ) .",
    "the formation of temporary accretion disks was therefore considered .",
    "if accretion onto the neutron star is from a keplerian disk ( ghosh & lamb 1979 ) , the torque on the neutron star is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the specific angular momentum added by a keplerian disk to the neutron star at the inner disk edge @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the alfven radius , @xmath33 is the neutron star magnetic moment , @xmath34 is a dimensionless function that measures the variation of the accretion torque as estimated by the fastness parameter @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 is the critical fastness parameter where the accretion torque is expected to vanish at @xmath37 depending on the structure of the disk . according to this model",
    "the torque will cause a spin - up if the neutron star is rotating slowly ( @xmath38 ) in the same sense as the circulation in the disk , or spin - down , if it is rotating in the opposite sense . even if the neutron star is rotating in the same sense as the disk flow , the torque will spin - down the neutron star if it is rotating too rapidly ( @xmath39 ) . in such a model",
    "one should see positive correlation between pulse frequency derivative ( @xmath3 ) and moderate mass accretion rate ( @xmath40 ) if the disk is rotating in the same sense as the neutron star ( baykal 1997 ) .",
    "recent observations of accreting neutron stars have shown stochastic spin - up / down trends on time scales from days to a few years ( bildsten et al .",
    "some of the sources switch from spin - up to spin - down states without showing great changes in their mass accretion rates ( bildsten et al .",
    "these unusual behaviors led nelson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to the possibility of retrograde circulation of accretion disks .",
    "gx 4 + 1 shows correlation between the x - ray flux and the spin - down rate ( chakrabarty et al . 1997 ) which may suggest a retrograde accretion disk . in our rxte observations ,",
    "oao 1657 - 415 has shown marginal correlation with accretion rate and pulse frequency change .",
    "this positive correlation strongly suggesting that the disk formed in the spin - down episode is in prograde direction . from the batse observations ,",
    "it was concluded that the pulse frequency derivatives and x - ray flux were not well correlated and the 8 days was the minimum for the correlation time scale ( baykal 1997 ) .",
    "this rxte observation implies that the time - scale of correlation is short , only a few days . to see the exact nature of correlations between x - ray flux and pulse frequency derivatives ,",
    "an even more extensive broad band x - ray observation should be carried out .",
