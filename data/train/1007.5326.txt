    "despite significant progresses in understanding the physics of single star formation , we still have only crude ideas about why some giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) form clusters , some form distributed associations , and some form very few stars . to make headway , key properties of gmcs displaying various intensities of star formation",
    "must be explored observationally in detail .",
    "after massive stars are formed , their energy feedback through ionizing fluxes , fast stellar winds , and supernova explosions can alter the physical conditions of a gmc , subsequently enhancing or inhibiting further star formation .",
    "if a knowledge of stellar content and energy feedback is obtained , it is then possible to assess the relative importance of self - propagating , triggered , and spontaneous star formation , and even further estimate the star formation efficiency of a gmc .",
    "it is thus crucial to inventory massive stars and young stellar objects ( ysos ) associated with gmcs .",
    "the ysos are particularly important as they provide the most direct probes for causal relationship between the initial condition ( gas ) and the end product ( stars ) .",
    "such study is straightforward in concept , but difficult in practice because in distant galaxies the stellar content is not resolved , and in the milky way the distances and associations among stars and their interstellar environments are uncertain .",
    "the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc and smc ) are the only nearby star - forming galaxies in which stars are at common , known distances and can be resolved individually .",
    "recent high - sensitivity mid - ir _ spitzer space telescope ( sst ) _ observations make it possible to study a large sample of ysos in the mcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the nearly face - on orientation and thin disk structure of the lmc make it easy to identify physical associations between ysos and their interstellar environments .",
    "all objects in the lmc can be considered to be at a uniform distance , with @xmath210% error , of 50 kpc @xcite . in our recent study of massive ysos in the lmc  complex n44 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper i ) , we examined three gmcs with different star formation properties : the central and southern gmcs are associated with bright  regions and have o - type ysos , while the northern gmc contains only a few faint , small   regions and has no o - type ysos .",
    "the close association of massive ysos with  regions in gmcs suggests that massive stars preferentially form in regions where massive stars have been formed previously , within the last few myr .",
    "it is not clear whether this result is a special case for n44 or can be generalized .",
    "we have thus selected more lmc  complexes with different morphologies of ionized gas and molecular clouds to examine their yso content and distribution .",
    "this study reports massive star formation in the  complex lh@xmath0  120-n159 ( hereafter n159 ; * ? ? ?",
    "n159 is located between two regions with contrasting activities : to its north are a string of active star formation regions such as 30 doradus , n158 , and n160 , and to its south lies a large molecular ridge with little star formation activity ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the ionized gas of n159 shows two prominent lobes in the central region , surrounded by smaller  regions ( figure  [ fig : n159opt]a ) .",
    "the two prominent  lobes exhibit filamentary arcs resultant from interactions with stellar winds and a supernova remnant ( snr ) in the northern lobe @xcite .",
    "the northern and southern lobes appear to be separated by dark clouds , but their independent systems of circular filaments do not suggest a common origin for their photoionization and dynamic shaping .",
    "the stellar content of n159 has been identified loosely as an ob association , i.e. , lh105 @xcite .",
    "based on integrated colors and association with discrete  regions in n159 , @xcite identified three young clusters of ages @xmath2 10 myr in the a , f , and d components , and an ob association in the c component ( see figure  [ fig : n159opt]a for the identification of  components ) .",
    "surveys of co toward n159 ( figure  [ fig : n159opt]b ) show three molecular concentrations whose peaks correspond to three gmcs , n159-e , n159-w , and n159-s , respectively @xcite . the similarity in their radial velocities ,",
    "@xmath3 km  s@xmath4 , suggests that they are likely physically related .",
    "n159-e is associated with the central prominent  regions of n159 , the bulk of the ob association lh105 @xcite , which include the young cluster in the d component .",
    "n159-w , an immediate neighbor of n159-e , hosts a few small , bright  regions and the western part of lh105 , which includes the two young clusters in the a and f components . in sharp contrast",
    ", the gmc n159-s shows a much lower level of star formation with only a couple of very faint diffuse   regions and no ob associations , although it is similar in size and even larger in mass compared with each of its northern neighbors at @xmath5  away .",
    "a recent study by @xcite identified candidate herbig ae / be ( haebe ) stars in gmc n159-s and suggested that cluster formation had just begun in this gmc .",
    "however , it is not clear whether the scarcity in massive stars seen in the optical and near - ir wavelengths in this gmc is caused by massive stars being still at infancy and deeply embedded in circumstellar material , or not being formed actively at all .    to study the current massive star formation in n159 ,",
    "we have used archival _ spitzer _",
    "mid - ir observations and obtained complementary ground - based optical and near - ir observations .",
    "these observations have been analyzed and the results are reported in this paper .",
    "section  2 describes the observations and data reduction .",

    "we discuss the massive star formation properties .",
    "a summary is given in section  6 .",
    "we have used _ spitzer _ mid - ir observations to diagnose ysos . to extend the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and to improve the angular resolution ,",
    "we have further obtained ground - based optical and near - ir imaging observations of n159 .",
    "we have also retrieved available images in the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) archive to examine the optical counterparts and environments of the ysos .",
    "archival _ spitzer _ observations from the legacy program surveying the agents of a galaxy s evolution ( sage ; * ? ? ? * ) and gto program 124 ( pi : gehrz ) were used to study ysos in n159 .",
    "these observations include images taken with the infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath1 m  and the multiband imaging photometer for _ spitzer _ ( mips ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at 24 , 70 , and 160 @xmath1 m . the observation summary is listed in table  [ mirobs ] , in which the program i d , principal investigator , and typical observation parameters are given .",
    "we have adopted the _ spitzer _",
    "photometry of point sources from @xcite .",
    "the photometric data are used to construct seds , and the images are used to examine the structure of cold and partially ionized interstellar matter .",
    "to cover regions associated with the three gmcs around n159 , the field we have analyzed is @xmath6125 and is shown in figure  [ fig : n159img ] in the 3.6 , 8.0 , and 24 @xmath1 m  bands . the 3.6 @xmath1 m  image is dominated by stellar emission , the 8.0 @xmath1mimage shows the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ( pah ) emission , and the 24 @xmath1 m  image is dominated by dust continuum emission @xcite .",
    "to better illustrate the relative distribution of emission in different bands , we have produced a color composite with 3.6 , 8.0 , and 24 @xmath1 m  images mapped in blue , green , and red , respectively . in this color composite ( figure  [ fig : n159img]d ) , dust emission appears red and diffuse , stars appear as blue point sources , red supergiants appear yellow , and dust - shrouded ysos and evolved stars appear red .",
    "we obtained near - ir images in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 bands with the infrared side port imager ( ispi ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on the blanco 4  m telescope at cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) on 2006",
    "november 9 .",
    "the images were obtained with the @xmath9k hgcdte hawaii-2 array , which had a pixel scale of 03  pixel@xmath4 and a field - of - view of @xmath10 .",
    "n159 was observed in one field with ten 30 s exposures in the @xmath7 band and twenty 30 s exposures in the @xmath8 band ( each of the latter was coadded from two 15  s frames to avoid background saturation ) .",
    "the observations were dithered to aid in the removal of transients and chip defects .",
    "the sky observations were made before and after each set of ten on - source exposures .",
    "all images were processed using the iraf package ` cirred ` for dark and sky subtraction and flat - fielding .",
    "the astrometry of individual processed images was solved with the routine ` imwcs ` in the package ` wcstools ` .",
    "the astrometrically calibrated images are then coadded to produce a total exposure map for each filter .",
    "the flux calibration was carried out using 2mass photometry of isolated sources .",
    "as some of the ysos appear extended in the ispi images , we have used additional @xmath7 and @xmath8 images taken with the nasmyth adaptive optics system and near - infrared imager and spectrograph ( naco ) on the 8.2  m very large telescope ( vlt ) at the european southern observatory ( eso ) @xcite .",
    "these images have a pixel size of 0027 - 0054 pixel@xmath4 and a superb resolution of 011 - 025 , and are thus used to resolve compact groups of ysos .",
    "we have searched the _ hst _ archive for wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) and advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) images in the field of n159 .",
    "these observations are listed in table  [ hstobs ] , in which the coordinate , program i d , pi , detector , filter , and total exposure time are given .",
    "each observation contains multiple exposures for the same pointing and filter , and these images have been pipeline - processed to remove cosmic rays and to produce a total exposure map , which is available in the hubble legacy archive .",
    "four fields have observations , but not all are useful ; for example , the wide @xmath11 band ( f300w ) images have very low s / n .",
    "the most useful images are those taken with the h@xmath0  filter ( wfpc2/f656n or acs / f658n ) or broad - band filters at longer wavelengths such as strmgren @xmath12 ( f547 m ) or wfpc2 @xmath13 ( f555w and f814w ) .",
    "the former show ionized gas and the latter show stars at high resolution .      to construct seds for sources in the _ spitzer _ catalog from @xcite ,",
    "we have expanded the catalog by adding optical @xmath14 photometry from the magellanic cloud photometric survey ( mcps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and near - ir @xmath15 photometry from the point source catalog of the two micron all sky survey ( 2mass ; * ? ? ?",
    "as the 2mass catalog is relatively shallow with a photometric limit of @xmath16 , we have also used the point source catalog from the infrared survey facility ( irsf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which is @xmath17 2 mag deeper than the 2mass catalog , to match the irac sources that do not have 2mass counterparts .",
    "when merging the datasets , we allow a 1@xmath18 error margin for matching _ spitzer _ sources with optical or near - ir sources .",
    "thus , for each _ spitzer _ source , the magnitudes from @xmath11 to 70 @xmath1 m   can be converted to flux densities using the corresponding zero - magnitude flux listed in table  [ photpar ] and then used to construct the sed .",
    "we have used h@xmath0  images of n159 from the magellanic cloud emission - line survey ( mcels ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to examine the large - scale distribution of dense ionized gas and to compare with images at other wavelengths .",
    "as the angular resolution of this survey is @xmath19 , we have used additional h@xmath0  images taken with the mosaic camera on the ctio blanco 4  m telescope that cover the northern part of our working field @xcite .",
    "these images , with a pixel size of 027 pixel@xmath4 , are used to show the immediate environments of ysos .",
    "finally , as stars are formed from molecular gas , we have also used the co observations from the magellanic mopra assessment ( magma ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to examine the distribution of molecular clouds in n159 .",
    "ysos are enshrouded in dust that absorbs stellar uv and optical radiation and re - radiates in the ir . thus",
    ", ysos can be distinguished from normal stars , i.e. , main - sequence , giant , and supergiant stars , from their excess ir emission ; they are positioned in redder parts of the color - color and color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) than normal stars . however , background galaxies and evolved stars such as asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars can also be red sources , and these contaminants exist in non - negligible numbers . in paper",
    "i and @xcite , we have demonstrated that using two color - magnitude criteria @xmath20-[8.0 ] ) \\ge 2.0 $ ] and @xmath21 <   14 - ( [ 4.5]-[8.0])$ ] , galaxies and evolved stars can be effectively excluded for the initial selection of massive ysos .",
    "we have thus applied the same criteria to select yso candidates in n159 .",
    "note that although the full lmc catalogs of yso candidates have been constructed using similar methods @xcite , as will be discussed in  3.4 , a detailed analysis on small regions together with new information such as deep near - ir photometry as we perform here will be more complete and also useful in diagnosing sources that might have been previously mis - identified .",
    "figure  [ fig : cmds]a displays the [ 8.0 ] versus ( [ 4.5]@xmath22[8.0 ] ) cmd of all sources detected in n159 . to illustrate the locations of agb stars in the cmd ,",
    "models for galactic c- and o - rich agb stars @xcite are also plotted .",
    "although the lmc metallicity is only @xmath23 solar , as confirmed in @xcite , these galactic models should be good approximations for lmc objects since the chemistry of agb atmospheres is dominated by nucleosynthesized material . to avoid crowding , we plot only models for a stellar luminosity of 3000 @xmath24 to illustrate the range of colors . for a luminosity range @xmath25 @xcite ,",
    "the expected loci of agb stars in the cmd can move vertically from 1.2 to @xmath26 mag .",
    "we have also searched the known evolved stars in n159 in the simbad database and found 4 confirmed agb stars at various evolutionary stages : 2 carbon stars and 2 oh / ir stars .",
    "these 4 objects are marked with open squares in the [ 8.0 ] versus ( [ 4.5]@xmath22[8.0 ] ) cmd ( figure  [ fig : cmds]a ) .",
    "their locations overlap with agb stellar models and our selection criteria indeed exclude them .",
    "we obtain a list of 52 yso candidates from the above selection criteria , however , they still include a significant number of small dust knots , obscured evolved stars , and bright background galaxies .",
    "these contaminants need to be examined closely to assess their nature and to be excluded from the yso list . following the procedures outlined in paper i , to better resolve these ir sources and their environments , we examine the _ hst _ , ctio 4 m ispi @xmath27 , and ctio 4 m mosaic h@xmath0  images .",
    "we further use the multi - wavelength catalog described in  2.4 to construct seds from the @xmath11-band to 70 @xmath1 m . using these images and sed data ,",
    "we have assessed whether the candidates are truly ysos .",
    "background galaxies can be identified from their morphologies if they are resolved .",
    "two of our cmd - selected yso candidates , sources 054037.09@xmath22694521.5 and 054044.66@xmath22694550.9 show elongated , extended emission around the point sources in high - resolution mosaic and ispi images .",
    "the seds of these two sources are similar to those of late - type galaxies , i.e. , characterized by two broad humps , one from stellar emission over optical and near - ir wavelength range and the other from dust emission over mid- to far - ir range .",
    "in addition , the interstellar environment around these two sources are relatively dust free as they have little diffuse 8 @xmath1 m  emission in the surroundings . based on these considerations ,",
    "these two cmd - selected yso candidates are reclassified as background galaxies .",
    "warm interstellar dust may show mid - ir seds indicative of pah emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , similar to those of circumstellar dust in ysos .",
    "as the angular resolution of irac images is @xmath28 , corresponding to 0.5 pc for a lmc distance of 50 kpc , some small dust clumps may be identified as point sources and included in the yso candidate list .",
    "in addition , a main - sequence star projected near a dust clump or superposed on dust filaments may also make its way into our yso candidate list . to identify these two types of yso imposters",
    ", we use our high angular resolution ( 03  pixel@xmath4 ) ispi @xmath27 images . in the ispi images , stars or ysos appear unresolved and can be further differentiated with the @xmath29 color as stars are brighter in @xmath7 and ysos brighter in @xmath8 .",
    "dust clumps may appear as extended emission or have no point - like counterparts in the ispi @xmath8 image .",
    "these dust clumps are unlikely to have highly embedded massive ysos since none of them have bright 24 @xmath1 m  point sources as would have been expected for such ysos ; however , they may have ysos with lower masses . as a reference ,",
    "herbig ae stars of a0-type at different evolutionary stages would have been detected , because ab aur and lk h@xmath0  25 @xcite placed at the lmc distance would have @xmath30 and 18.6 , respectively , and the photometric limit of our @xmath8 images at 10-@xmath31 level is @xmath32 mag and the 3-@xmath31 detection limit is @xmath33 mag @xcite .",
    "aided by the ispi images , we find that 16 of our 52 yso candidates are interstellar dust clumps , and another 7 are stars projected near dust clumps .      the results of our examination of 52 yso candidates are given in table  [ ysoclass ] , which lists source name , ranking of the brightness at 8 @xmath1 m , magnitudes in the 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , 24 , and 70 @xmath1 m  bands , source classification , and remarks .",
    "each source s magnitudes in the @xmath11 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath7 , @xmath37 , @xmath8 bands are given in table  [ ysoclassb ] .",
    "note that some of the ysos appear as single sources in irac images but are resolved into multiple sources in high - resolution ispi and vlt / naco images ; for these sources , the photometric measurements in table  [ ysoclassb ] were made for the dominant yso sources , i.e. , the brightest @xmath8 sources with the reddest @xmath38 colors .",
    "the `` flag '' in table  [ ysoclassb ] gives the origin of data from which @xmath15 are measured .",
    "the results of yso identification are shown in the [ 8.0 ] versus ( [ 4.5]@xmath22[8.0 ] ) cmd ( figure  [ fig : cmds]b ) . among the 52 yso candidates , we identified 2 background galaxies , 16 dust clumps , and 7 stars superposed on dust . after excluding these sources , 27 yso candidates remain .",
    "as these are most likely bona fide ysos , we will simply call them ysos in the rest of the paper .    following the classification scheme proposed in paper i",
    ", we have further categorized these ysos into type i , ii , and iii by analyzing their properties and corresponding sed plots .",
    "type i ysos have seds with a steep rise from the near - ir to 24 @xmath1 m  as the radiation is mostly from their circumstellar envelopes .",
    "they are generally not visible in the optical or @xmath7-band , but are visible in the @xmath8-band and bright at 24 - 70 @xmath1 m .",
    "type i ysos are often found in or behind dark clouds .",
    "type ii ysos have seds with a low peak in the optical and a high peak at 8 - 24 @xmath1 m  corresponding to stellar core and circumstellar disk , respectively , after the envelope has dissipated .",
    "type ii ysos are faint in the optical , but bright in the @xmath7-band to 8 @xmath1 m , and then faint again at the 24 @xmath1 m . type iii ysos have seds peaking in the optical with a modest amount of dust emission in the near- to mid - ir as they are largely exposed but still possess remnant circumstellar material .",
    "their brightness fades in the longer wavelength and they are often surrounded by  regions .",
    "the results of our classification of 27 ysos are also given in table  [ ysoclass ] .",
    "multi - wavelength images and seds of these ysos have been shown in @xcite , though differences exist in some seds between theirs and this study due to the inclusion of aforementioned deeper near - ir catalogs and that 24 @xmath1 m  upper limits were estimated for a few ysos in order to better constrain model fitting to these seds as discussed later in  4 .",
    "n159 contains the first extragalactic protostar discovered by @xcite using ground - based near- to mid - ir @xmath39 photometry ; this protostar corresponds to our yso 053959.34@xmath22694526.3 . using sensitive _",

    "one of these 4 sources does not match their set of selection criteria and hence is not included as a yso in the @xcite catalog .",

    "furthermore , ysos in multiple systems or ysos in ultracompact or compact  regions ( see  4.2.2 for a detailed discussion ) are likely to be measured as a single source .",
    "while it is necessary to relax the search criteria for point sources in the lmc to obtain the most complete census of ysos possible , the relaxed search also requires that individual sources are examined carefully in order to remove diffuse sources or local peaks in the dusty interstellar medium .",
    "the color criteria commonly used for identifying low - mass ysos , as applied in @xcite , are too stringent for massive ysos , particularly when they are at early evolutionary stages .",
    "as shown in models of massive ysos , such emission is dominated by massive envelopes and hence seds peak toward wavelengths longer than 24 @xmath1 m . these seds have a generally rising slope at shorter wavelengths such as irac bands of 3.68.0 @xmath1 m , but show structures depending on , e.g. , the detailed geometry of the dust distribution @xcite . the yso selection method used in our study",

    "the observed sed of a yso can be compared with model seds , and the best - fit models selected by @xmath48 statistics can be used to infer the probable ranges of physical parameters for the yso .",
    "we use a grid of dust radiative transfer models calculated with the hochunk monte - carlo code @xcite , each containing a point source photospheric emitter ( pre - main - sequence or main - sequence spectrum ) , a flared circumstellar disk , a flattened rotating envelope , and a bipolar cavity ( see * ? ? ?",

    "the fitting can be carried out with the fitting tool online sed fitter @xcite .",

    "mass depends on pre - main - sequence evolutionary tracks , which may introduce a sysmtematic offset , and although the mass of warm circumstellar dust is relatively robust , its translation into an accretion rate and evolutionary state depends on the applicability of the single - yso dust geometry used in our radiative transfer models .",
    "the sed fits of the 22 `` single '' ysos , as displayed in figure  [ fig : fit ] , show different degrees of goodness - of - fit among our empirically defined yso types .",

    "two of them show reasonable agreement in the sed fits , while the other two exhibit significant discrepancies between models and observed seds .",
    "the above - mentioned discrepancies and possible causes are discussed below in  4.2 .",
    "a number of ysos in n159 show a brightness dip at 4.5 @xmath1 m   in their seds ( figure  [ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "this is similar to ysos in paper i , and has been suggested that the apparent dip is not an absorption feature but caused by raised fluxes from pah emission at 3.3 , 6.2 , 7.7 , and 8.6 @xmath1 m  in the other three irac bands , and the difference between observed and modeled seds is due to models not including pahs or small grains .",
    "the existence of pah emission in massive ysos in the lmc has been confirmed in a recent study using _ spitzer _ infrared spectrometer ( irs ) observations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , pah emission appears to almost ubiquitously present among massive ysos , as it is detected in 87% of 277 irs spectra of massive ysos .",
    "we examined the irs spectra of @xcite and found that 28 of 29 ysos in n44 ( paper i ) and 11 of the 11 ysos in n159 show pah emission in their irs spectra , confirming our explanation of the 4.5 @xmath1 m  dip in seds as a result of pah emission in the other three irac bands .    while including pahs and small grains in yso models is in progress ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we can use irs spectra to estimate the uncertainty in deriving physical parameters of ysos with current models .",
    "we have selected yso 053935.99@xmath22694604.1 for illustration since this source is bright enough to ensure accurate photometric measurements and its sed shows an obvious dip at 4.5 @xmath1 m .",
    "furthermore , this yso has no silicate absorption at 10 @xmath1 m  in the irs spectrum @xcite so that the contribution of pah emission can be estimated by direct comparison between photometric data and the spectrum .",
    "the photometric sed and irs spectrum of yso 053935.99@xmath22694604.1 are shown in figure  [ fig : pah]a , where pah emission at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 and 11.3 @xmath1 m  are marked .",
    "although 4.5 @xmath1 m  is outside of irs s spectral range , this photometric datapoint appears to be consistent with the continuum level extending from those around 10 and 15 @xmath1 m .",
    "we thus assumed that the difference between the photometric datapoints at 5.8 and 8.0 @xmath1 m  and the underlying continuum level is entirely due to pah emission and derived a factor of 1.8 for the ( pah+continuum)/continuum ratio .",
    "we divided the observed fluxes at 3.6 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath1 m  by this factor and modeled the pah - corrected sed .",
    "the model fits to the yso s sed before and after the pah correction is shown in figures  [ fig : pah]b and c ; the pah - corrected sed is well reproduced by yso models .",
    "the results of the fits are listed in table  [ fitcom ] , including @xmath48-weighted average and standard deviation of stellar mass , total luminosity , envelope accretion rate , and stage range .",
    "all four but one parameter inferred from fits to seds before and after pah correction are in good agreement .",
    "the exception is @xmath55 , whose value is larger before the pah correction ; however , this parameter is poorly constrained .",
    "this result is understandable since the raised fluxes from pah emission in the three irac bands is compensated by additional amount of larger dust grains incorporated in the models and hence the larger @xmath55 , and the ambiguous geometry of dust distribution ( in disk or envelope ) causes the large uncertainties in @xmath55 .",
    "nonetheless , the other three main parameters are not sensitive to this contamination and thus the conclusions based on stellar mass , total luminosity , and stage range derived from model fits to observed seds without pah corrections are not compromised .      among the four type iii ysos ,",
    "two show significant discrepancies between the best - fit models and the observed seds : 053945.18@xmath22694450.4 and 054004.40@xmath22694437.6 ( figure  [ fig : fit ] ) .",
    "these two ysos have seds agreeing with the stellar photospheric emission in near - ir but deviant in optical bands . to understand the cause of this discrepancy",

    "yso 054004.40@xmath22694437.6 coincides with the compact  region the papillon nebula @xcite of diameters @xmath66 ( @xmath67pc @xmath68 0.7 pc ) , resolved in both mosaic and _ hst _ images .    for both ysos",
    ", the optical @xmath14 photometry were adopted from mcps catalog .",
    "this catalog used broad - band images taken with a ccd camera of a 07 pixel@xmath4 scale and under seeings of 12 - 18 @xcite .",
    "thus , compact  regions of radii @xmath69 are unlikely to be resolved from the central stars .",
    "bright nebular emission lines such as h@xmath70  would have significant contribution to @xmath34 and @xmath35 bands , and hence these fluxes deviate from stellar models , resulting in larger uncertainties in physical parameters inferred from sed fits .",
    "furthermore , the presence of  regions also suggests that the dust emission can have an interstellar , instead of circumstellar , origin .",
    "thus , the inferred envelope accretion rate and disk mass are less reliable , and so is the stage .",
    "this is similar to the yso associated with a small  region resolved by _ hst _ in n44 , yso052207.3@xmath22675819.9 ( paper i ) .",
    "these results signify the importance of using high - resolution h@xmath0  images to reveal small  regions that are responsible for the dust emission and indicate the last evolutionary stage as a yso approaches the main sequence stage . on the other hand , the good agreement among mass estimates for yso052207.3@xmath22675819.9 using different independent methods demonstrates that for a sed relatively well reproduced by models ( and hence a good estimate for the total luminosity of the system ) , the mass of the central star inferred from sed fits remains reliable .",
    "this is likely the case for yso 053945.18@xmath22694450.4 . as for yso 054004.40@xmath22694437.6 ,",
    "the system is more complicated and will be discussed in  4.3 .      at the lmc s distance of 50 kpc",
    ", irac s @xmath17 20 angular resolution translates into 0.5 pc , which can hide a small group of ysos .",
    "indeed , 10 of the ysos are resolved by our ispi images ( with a 03 pixel@xmath4 scale ) into multiple sources or even small clusters within the irac psf .",
    "another 10 ysos appear more extended than the ispi psf ; two of these have naco images available and both are resolved into multiple sources .",
    "these results suggest that at least 44% and up to 74% of the irac - identified ysos are multiple sources .",
    "similarly high fractions , 5065% , have been reported for ysos in n44 ( paper  i ) and for 82 lmc ysos which have archival _ hst _",
    "h@xmath0  images available @xcite . while the ispi and naco @xmath27 images allow us to identify the dominant yso in a multiple system for accurate photometric measurements , the irac measurements correspond to the integrated light of all sources within the psf .",
    "this mismatch is not problematic if one yso dominates the emission in ir bands ; however , if two or more ysos are present within the irac psf , the sed modeling can produce very uncertain results .",
    "below we use two examples to illustrate the extent of errors caused by multiplicity .",
    "the yso 053941.89@xmath22694612.0 in n159 appears extended in the ispi @xmath27 images and is resolved into four sources within 06 in the naco @xmath7 images . among these four ,",
    "the two brightest sources ( # 123 and # 121 in n159-a7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have @xmath8 = 13.31 and 13.52 and @xmath38 = 4.80 and 4.22 , respectively ; the extremely red colors originate from infrared excess unless the foreground extinction was exceedingly high , so these are most likely ysos .",
    "therefore , 053941.89@xmath22694612.0 can be used to assess uncertainties in sed fitting for cases where two ysos of comparable properties exist within the irac psf .",
    "we construct seds for these two bright sources , 053941.89@xmath22694612.0a and b , using @xmath27 from @xcite and irac / mips fluxes proportioned according to their @xmath8 mag ; the latter assumption is reasonable since both ysos have very red @xmath38 colors indicating early evolutionary stages .",
    "model fits to these two seds are shown in figure  [ fig : multi ] , along with fits to the sed of integrated fluxes of the multiple system .",
    "all three seds have similarly good fits .",
    "the results of the sed fits are listed in table  [ fitcom ] .",
    "the stellar mass inferred from the sed of integrated fluxes is 32 @xmath71 , and those for the individual a and b components are 27 and 25 @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "component a makes up @xmath72 half of the total light in near - ir and has an inferred mass @xmath73% of that from the sed of integrated fluxes .",
    "thus , for a source containing multiple ysos at similar evolutionary stages such as 053941.89@xmath22694612.0 , the inferred mass for individual ( most massive ) yso could be overestimated by @xmath74% , and the total yso masses may be underestimated by @xmath1740% .",
    "the second example of multiplicity in a yso source is 054004.40@xmath22694437.6  in n159b , or the papillon nebula @xcite .",
    "_ hst _ images revealed a complex  region around 054004.40@xmath22694437.6 .",
    "@xcite used the integrated h@xmath70  flux of the  region ( assuming ionization - bounded ) and determined that the spectral type of the ionizing source(s ) of n159b is at least o8v or earlier , while @xcite reported an o6v ionizing star based on the integrated radio centimeter continuum flux of n159b .",
    "the clumpy morphology seen in the _ hst _ images suggests that ionizing photons may leak from this region ; thus the o8v spectral type is a lower limit .",
    "as illustrated in figure  [ fig : multi]d , our single - yso model fails to simultaneously reproduce the mid - ir dust emission and the optical light .",
    "the latter , adopted from the relatively low - resolution mcps catalog , is almost certainly contaminated with nebular line emission from the ionized gas that is not included in the yso models .    to separate the central point source of 054004.40@xmath22694437.6  from the surrounding nebulosity",
    ", we use photometric measurements made with _ hst _",
    "images in the optical and vlt / naco adaptive optics images in @xmath8 . at other ir bands",
    ", we use the irsf @xmath75 measurements as upper limits , and irac and mips fluxes as they are .",
    "the resultant sed and model fits are shown in figure  [ fig : multi]e , and the inferred yso mass is @xmath76 ( table  [ fitcom ] ) .",
    "the sed fitting is biased toward _ hst _",
    "data points as they have smaller errors compared with those of _",
    "data points .",
    "it is thus not surprising that the yso mass is consistent with the b0/o9 spectral type implied by the _ hst _",
    "@xmath77 photometry .",
    "in fact , @xcite and @xcite have already suggested that the point source detected in",
    "images , which is also the brightest source in the vlt / naco @xmath8 image within the irac psf , does not account for the full luminosity or the centimeter radio flux of the nebula .",
    "as the optically brightest star in 054004.40@xmath22694437.6  may not be the yso contributing to the observed mid - ir emission , we decouple the mid - ir part of the sed from the rest and make sed fits to only the mid - ir segment .",
    "this is essentially using the luminosity of dust emission as a calorimeter to infer the effective luminosity of the main energizing source(s ) without specifically trying to separate those sources from the  region .",
    "the result should be consistent with the spectral type derived from the total radio continuum emission from the  region .",
    "figure  [ fig : multi]f shows that the mid - ir part of the sed can be reproduced by models reasonably well , and the inferred mass , @xmath78 ( table  [ fitcom ] ) , is indeed in agreement with the o6v spectral type derived from radio observations @xcite .",
    "therefore , the main ionizing sources of the papillon nebula are still hidden behind a large amount of dust .    in summary , when a yso is in a multiple system , it is crucial to use high - resolution optical and near - ir images to assess whether the multiple components are at different evolutionary stages .",
    "if the dominant sources are at similar yso stages , model fits of the integrated seds would overestimate the mass of the most massive yso but underestimate the total mass of the ysos . on the other hand ,",
    "if multiple sources at different evolutionary stages are present , the optical and near - ir emission may be dominated by the exposed stars and the mid - ir emission dominated by more embedded ysos . under these circumstances",
    ", model fits to the mid - ir portion of the sed can still provide useful information on the dominant heating sources .",
    "lastly , we note that since only one case in each of these two types of system is investigated , our estimates on mulitiplicity effect is thus approximate and a better quantification requires a larger sample .",
    "a cautionary corollary of our result is that the uncertainties would be even larger in mass estimates for ysos of three or more comparably bright objects , such as the 5 multiple ysos that are already resolved in the ispi @xmath27 images since each single source could be further resolved into multiples in even higher resolution ( e.g. , the aforementioned naco ) images .",
    "we use our analysis of 22 `` single '' ysos to compare our empirical classification , type , with the theoretical classification , stage @xcite .",
    "as listed in table  [ sedfits ] , types and stages are only loosely correlated .",
    "this lack of overwhelming correspondence is also seen in paper i and may be attributed to two reasons primarily related to the relatively large distance of the lmc . in an unresolved cluster treated as a single source , details of the circumstellar dust geometry",
    "may not correspond extremely well to our model prescription , making the translation of fitted dust mass into an accretion rate ( quantitative stage ) less certain . on the other hand ,",
    "a type determined from environmental morphology on parsec scale may also not accurately reflect the evolutionary state of a single yso .",
    "the methods are both useful , neither definitive .",
    "second , limited angular resolution may cause inclusion of extraneous dust emission from unresolved  regions .",
    "this is particularly relevant to ysos at a late evolutionary stage , such as the three type iii ysos that show small  regions in the mosaic h@xmath0  images ; the mid - ir emission from unresolved  regions would have been erroneously modeled as circumstellar disks or envelopes .",
    "nevertheless , we expect the extreme stage i ysos to correspond to our type i ysos , since they are deeply embedded in massive envelopes .",
    "indeed , table  [ sedfits ] shows that type i ysos are well fitted by stage i models .",
    "we also expect type iii ysos without  region confusions to correspond to stage iii ysos , and indeed this is the case for 054000.69@xmath22694713.4",
    ".    we also use the 11 ysos with irs observations to compare our empirical classification with the classification based on spectral features @xcite .",

    "compared with pe - type ysos , the p - type ysos may have an earlier evolutionary stage because of a higher accretion rate that quenches the formation of an  region or have a stellar temperature too low to provide ionizing flux @xcite .",
    "the p - type yso in n159 , 053929.21@xmath22694719.0 , is classified as type i , and additional evidence is presented in  4.4.2 to suggest that this p - type yso is in an earlier evolutionary stage than the pe - type ysos .",
    "the strongest spectral feature that correlates with our empirical classification is the silicate absorption .",
    "the presence of silicate absorption is an indication of early evolutionary stage @xcite .",

    "the warm envelope of an uchii contributes to the mid - ir emission modeled in the sed , and raises the derived accretion rate .",
    "thus , the high envelope accretion rates of ysos associated with these uchiis and the h@xmath83o maser mostly suggest that they still have abundant dust / gas in the surroundings and have not significantly cleared their environments . in terms of evolutionary sequence , we find that the maser is associated with type i while uchiis are associated with types i , i / ii , and iii ; this is consistent with the general picture that the maser phase happens earlier than uchii @xcite .",
    "although the sed of the maser source is probably also contaminated by hot dust in the environment that may not actually accrete onto the protostar .",
    "haebe stars are intermediate - mass young stars that have evolved from the most embedded phase and are now revealing their stellar components ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since our yso sample overlaps this mass range , we examine whether some of them might be previously classified as haebe stars .",
    "candidate haebe stars in n159 have been selected by @xcite using near - ir @xmath15 photometry .",
    "figure  [ fig : jhkcmds]a shows their locations marked on an 8 @xmath1 m  image of n159 , along with our ysos marked in different colors to indicate their evolutionary stages .",
    "figure  [ fig : jhkcmds]b and c show color - color and color - magnitude diagrams using @xmath15 photometry of sources in n159 that are detected in all three bands ( kindly provided by yasushi nakajima ; * ? ? ?",
    "as listed in table  [ evo ] , nine of these candidate haebe stars are identified as ysos and they have the following types of seds : one type i , one type i / ii , five type ii , and two type iii .",
    "the majority ( 78% ) of these haebe candidates are type ii and iii ysos , consistent with the expectation that such objects are less embedded .",
    "there are also two candidate haebe stars that we classify as non - yso sources : 053921.21@xmath22694409.4 is a star superposed on dust clumps , and 053938.80@xmath22694436.0 is the o7iii stellar counterpart of the high - mass x - ray binary lmc x-1 @xcite .",
    "the latter clearly is not a young star , and this explains why its colors are bluer than the other haebe stars ( see figure  [ fig : jhkcmds]b and c ) .",
    "the mass estimates from the best and acceptable fits of 27 ysos in n159 are listed in table  [ sedfits ] . among them , 22 ysos have single or dominant sources within the irac psf and their seds can be properly approximated by single - yso models to obtain reliable mass estimates .",
    "the other five have seds from multiple ysos or even non - yso sources such as stars or nebulosities ; their mass estimates have larger uncertainties and should be viewed as rough estimates .",
    "nevertheless , the results of sed fits show that twenty of the ysos in n159 have @xmath48-weighted average mass greater than @xmath91 and thus are most likely bona fide massive ysos .",
    "the remaining seven have @xmath48-weighted average @xmath92 and are likely intermediate - mass ysos .",
    "it has been suggested that the criterion [ 8.0 ] @xmath93 may be used to select massive ysos in the lmc @xcite .",
    "we find that indeed the @xmath48-weighted average mass of the brightest ysos , with [ 8.0 ] @xmath93 , are all @xmath94",
    ". this criterion may be too conservative , as all ( 15 out of 15 ) ysos with [ 8.0 ] @xmath95 still have masses @xmath94 the results are consistent with what we found for ysos in n44 ( paper i ) .    at the high - mass end ,",
    "nine ysos have @xmath48-weighted average mass @xmath96 ; these are most likely o - type ysos .",
    "two ysos have @xmath48-weighted average mass close to 17 @xmath71 and larger standard deviation that extending beyond 17 @xmath71 ; these may or may not be o - type stars .",
    "therefore , there exist at least 9 o - type ysos in n159 .",
    "these most massive ysos will be discussed further in  5.1 .",
    "it is difficult to study the relationship between interstellar conditions and the formation of massive stars because massive stars uv radiation fluxes and fast stellar winds quickly ionize and disperse the ambient ism .",
    "young massive ysos that have not significantly altered the physical conditions of their large - scale environments can be used to probe massive star formation .",
    "the large number of massive ysos found in n159 provides an excellent opportunity to investigate issues such as the relationship between star formation properties and interstellar conditions , progression of star formation , and evidence of triggered star formation .",
    "we examine the star formation properties of the molecular clouds in n159 as these clouds contain the bulk material to form stars .",
    "the sest and magma co surveys of the lmc @xcite show three large concentrations of molecular material in n159 , i.e. , the eastern , western , and southern peaks ( figure  [ fig : yso_pos ] ) .",
    "these three concentrations exhibit different numbers of massive stars formed in the last 10 myr , as evidenced by their different amounts of ionized gas .",
    "the eastern molecular peak is associated with bright h@xmath0  emission from the prominent central  regions .",
    "star formation has been occurring in this @xmath97 pc @xmath68 50 pc region for an extended period of time , as it contains both evolved and young massive stars .",
    "for example , star # 54 of @xcite is a b1 - 2 iv - ii star that is @xmath17 10 myr old , while their star # 62 is an o4 - 6 vn star that is @xmath98 myr old @xcite .",
    "the western molecular peak has only several small , disjoint  regions , but one of them , n159a , has the highest h@xmath0 surface brightness in the entire n159 .",
    "the massive stars in n159a and its surroundings have been imaged in @xmath99 and their colors and magnitudes indicate that their spectral types range from b2v to o56v @xcite . given the absence of snrs , these stars are most likely @xmath100 myr or that star formation started only in the last few myr .",
    "the southern molecular peak only has a couple of small  regions , indicating that only modest massive star formation has taken place .",
    "figure  [ fig : yso_pos ] shows that 96% ( @xmath101 ) of ysos in n159 are found within co contours @xmath42 1 k  km  s@xmath4 .",

    "the ysos of the three molecular peaks show different characteristics in their spatial distributions and interstellar environments .",
    "the western molecular peak has the highest concentrations of ysos , as 12 ysos are found within @xmath17 15 ( @xmath65 22 pc)-radius of the co contour peak and 6 of them cluster in a small region of @xmath105 ( @xmath6510 pc @xmath68 20 pc ) over the bright   region n159a and its north tip n159an .",
    "the eastern molecular peak has more widely distributed ysos , and most of them are associated with  regions .",
    "the southern molecular peak has 4 ysos that are loosely distributed , and they are not associated with any ionized gas .",
    "the ysos of the three molecular peaks in n159 also show differences in their mass distributions . in figure",
    "[ fig : yso_pos ] , we have marked the ysos with circles in three sizes that represent o - type stars with inferred @xmath106 , ( early ) b - type stars with @xmath107 , and intermediate - mass stars with @xmath108 .",
    "we found @xmath109% of the o- and b - type ysos in n159 are in or adjacent to  regions , similar to those seen in n44 ( paper i ) .",
    "the ysos with intermediate masses or without mass estimates do not show such preferred association with  regions , but this may be caused by an observational bias against the detection of these fainter intermediate - mass ysos over the bright background dust emission in  regions .",
    "the western and eastern molecular peaks , associated with bright regions , have a respectable number of o- and b - type ysos , while the southern molecular peak has one yso with mass @xmath110 and no o - type ysos at all .",
    "similar to the trend seen in n44 ( paper i ) , the characteristics of the current star formation in the three molecular peaks of n159 appear to be dependent on the massive star formation that occurred in the recent past .",
    "we have further examined whether the pattern of star formation is related to the physical properties of molecular clouds .",
    "the eastern , western , and southern molecular concentrations contain gmcs n159-e , n159-w@xmath111n159 - 2 , and n159-s@xmath111n159 - 3 , respectively @xcite .",
    "their physical properties adopted from @xcite are listed in table  [ gmc ] , including each gmc s local standard of rest velocity ( @xmath112 ) , co line - widths ( @xmath113 ) , virial mass ( @xmath114 ) , luminosity mass ( @xmath115 ) , and ratio of virial to luminosity mass .",
    "note that @xmath115 is converted from the co luminosity @xmath116 using @xmath117 , revised from equation ( 6 ) in @xcite for an @xmath118 value suitable for n159 @xcite .",
    "in addition , when there are two gmcs in a molecular concentration , we use averages of @xmath112 and @xmath113 and sums of @xmath114 and @xmath115 , respectively , to represent the properties of a concentration . for comparisons , in table  [ gmc ] we have also listed these quantities for gmcs in n44 @xcite , where the @xmath115 is converted from the co luminosity @xmath116 using @xmath119 for @xmath120  @xmath103 ( k km  s@xmath4)@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the gmc n159-w has the smallest @xmath113 and @xmath121 ratio , which can be an indicator of lower gravitational support , and contains the largest number and most concentrated distribution of massive ysos .",
    "similarly , the gmc n44-c has yso properties like n159-w and also has a smaller @xmath121 ratio among the gmcs in n44 .",
    "the larger sample of 36 lmc gmcs in @xcite showed a similar trend of more star formation activity at lower @xmath121 .",
    "this may reflect preferred physical conditions for gmcs to collapse and form a concentrated cluster , qualitatively consistent with the picture that a smaller turbulent kinetic energy results in larger volumes exceeding the jeans criterion for gravitational instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the similar values in @xmath113 and @xmath121 ratios found in the other two gmcs in n159 do not seem to scale with their different star formation activity , although the uncertainties in the virial analysis are large compared to the differences between the gmcs .",
    "detailed mapping of these three gmcs could reveal some of the physics underlying their different star formation characteristics .",
    "in particular , observations of denser gas tracers such as hco@xmath122 and hcn reveal the virial ratios and physical conditions of the _ clumps _ that are actively participating in star formation , whereas bright co emission can also come from more diffuse or photo - dissociation regions of the gmc .",
    "high - resolution ( @xmath123 ) hco@xmath122 observations of n159-e and w have shown that dense clumps are spatially correlated with ysos at early evolutionary stage ( chen et al , 2010 , in preparation ) , and new observations of n159-s taken in october 2009 will reveal whether dense clumps are present in this gmc as well .      a number of observational studies have demonstrated that the current star formation may be triggered by stellar energy feedback , such as through the expansion of an  region ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "n159 experiences intense energy feedback evidenced with the filamentary structure in the  regions ( figure  [ fig : n159opt ] ) and the existence of snr 0540@xmath22697 @xcite .",
    "n159 also has abundant molecular material for continued star formation .",
    "it is conceivable that its ( main - sequence ) massive stars photonionize the ambient gas to form  regions and the raised thermal pressure can compress the neighboring molecular cloud to trigger star formation .",
    "in fact , as shown in figure  [ fig : yso_pos ] , about 2/3 of the ysos are associated with h@xmath0  emission and almost all of them are in the eastern and western gmcs .",
    "in contrast , none of the four ysos in the southern gmc are associated with  regions . to investigate whether some of the current star formation in the eastern and western molecular concentrations may have been triggered , we compare the distributions of ysos relative to the massive stars , and use high - resolution mosaic h@xmath0  images to examine the immediate environment of ysos .",
    "the eastern gmc is associated with the prominent central  regions in n159 .",
    "this region has 17 spectroscopically identified massive stars @xcite .",
    "as shown in the mosaic h@xmath0  image in figure  [ fig : yso_mstar]a , these massive stars are distributed in the bright northern and southern lobes of the central  region , while the ysos are mostly found along the edges of an east - west oriented low - surface - brightness band between the two lobes . as",
    "this band coincides with the peak of the gmc , the spatial distributions of ysos appear to suggest that their formation is likely triggered by the expansion of two   regions ( lobes ) into a central molecular cloud . to test this hypothesis , we used two methods to search for massive stars in the central molecular cloud that were formed earlier before the external pressure was raised but are too obscured to be detected at optical wavelengths .",
    "we first use the 3  cm map to search for obscured o stars , since it is nearly extinction - free signpost of gas ionized by massive stars .",
    "figure  [ fig : yso_mstar]a reveals that the 3  cm emission of n159 @xcite appears diffuse for a @xmath124 resolution over ( mature ) massive stars in the bright  regions , but shows four peaks in the east - west central band and the western molecular concentration .",
    "three of the four 3  cm peaks are centered at o - type ysos associated with uchiis @xcite .",
    "the remaining 3  cm peak , i.e. , the faintest peak in the east - west band , is centered between two non - o - type ysos and has no uchiis detected .",
    "the absence of uchiis indicates that these ysos have lower masses than the detection limit of a b0 v star , or that the  regions of optically obscured ob stars are too extended and thus resolved out by the small synthesized beam @xcite .",
    "we next consider the candidate ob stars identified with @xmath15 photometry @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : yso_mstar]b shows that some of them are distributed around , though not inside the east - west band . to assess whether there might be ob stars hidden by extinction even in the near - ir",
    ", we use the h@xmath0  and 3  cm maps to estimate the extinction .",
    "assuming that the 3  cm emission of n159 is completely thermal697 @xcite . ] , the extinction in the h@xmath0  emission , @xmath125 , of a 10,000 k  region can be estimated using @xmath126 where @xmath127 ergs  @xmath103  s@xmath4  jy@xmath4 and then converted to the visual extinction using @xmath128 @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : yso_mstar]b shows the visual extinction map and its peak value is @xmath129 in the east - west band . for a standard extinction curve of @xmath130 and @xmath131 , an o8 v star would have @xmath132 and @xmath133 @xcite , brighter than the catalog s 10-@xmath31 limiting magnitudes of @xmath134 and @xmath135 @xcite , and would have been detected if the local variation in the extinction is within a factor of 3 , i.e. , @xmath136 . as for massive ysos which usually have [ 8.0 ] @xmath95 , a foreground extinction of @xmath137 corresponds to @xmath138 @xcite and imposes little effect on their detection .",
    "the above considerations suggest that the peak of the eastern gmc was not active in producing o - type stars a few myr in the past and only began to form them currently in locations on the edges contacting  regions .",
    "thus , the formation of the ysos in the gmc n159-e is likely triggered .",
    "it is interesting to note that ysos 054003.49@xmath22694355.0 and 054004.40@xmath22694437.6 in ngc159-e are projected within and at the edge of snr 0540@xmath22697 ( figure  [ fig : yso_mstar]a ) . for this snr to be responsible for the formation of these two ysos",

    "the age of this snr , estimated from its size and expansion velocity , is @xmath139 years @xcite .",
    "the absolute ages of the ysos are difficult to estimate .",
    "however , the brighter and more massive of the two ysos , 054004.40@xmath22694437.6 , has formed a small  region visible in the optical wavelength , i.e. , the papillon nebula @xcite , and hence its age is likely to be more than several 10@xmath140 years @xcite .",
    "the fainter and less massive of the two ysos has evolved beyond the earliest evolutionary stage and thus unlikely to be younger than a few 10@xmath140 years .",
    "the age consideration suggests that the snr is unlikely to be responsible for the formation of these two ysos .",
    "the western gmc in n159 abuts the central  regions . for the expanding  regions to trigger star formation in this molecular concentration",
    ", the crossing time scale should be shorter than the ages of massive stars and ysos .",
    "figure  [ fig : yso_mstar]a shows that the boundary of the  regions is @xmath141 , or a projected distance of 10 pc from the massive stars and ysos .",
    "for this distance and a velocity dispersion @xmath31 of 2.6 km  s@xmath4 of the gmc n159-w ( from @xmath142 and @xmath143 km  s@xmath4 , * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , ysos in the western gmc are concentrated in the molecular core , in contrast to the ysos in the eastern gmc that are spread out and distributed along the interface between the molecular cloud and  region .",
    "it has been suggested that the star formation in n159 started near the center of the diffuse radio emission where ob stars identified with @xmath146 photometry are located , and proceeded outwards to trigger next - generation star formation in the eastern and western gmcs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our detailed analysis finds a more complicated pattern of star formation .",
    "the expansion of the central  region has triggered the star formation in the eastern gmc , but not the western gmc .",
    "it is possible that the star formation in the western gmc was triggered by some force that is no longer identifiable , such as an old snr whose shock velocity had slowed down to 2045 km  s@xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is also known that in an active star forming region , the environment is usually too complex to pinpoint the triggering mechanism for star formation @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , based on the distribution of ysos concentrated near the core of the western gmc as well as its lowest velocity dispersion ( kinetically cold ) among gmcs in n159 , we suggest that its star formation may have started spontaneously .",
    "this suggestion is further supported by the most massive stars formed in the western gmc , as shown below .",
    "a trend is observed in ysos in  regions in the milky way and the lmc that in triggered star formation , the second generation is less massive than the first ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the most massive yso formed in the western gmc , 053937.53@xmath22694609.8 , is o5.5v @xcite , more massive than the only spectroscopically classified o8 star colors and magnitudes , however such conversion is known to have large uncertainties ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "] in the bright  region n159a @xcite .",
    "the spectral types derived from radio continuum by @xcite may be underestimates if significant ionizing flux is leaking from the uchii , and there is a systematic uncertainty in converting from ionizing flux to spectral type due to differences in massive stellar atmosphere models .",
    "however , the comparison of most massive ysos and main - sequence stars in these two gmcs suggests that the eastern gmc is more consistent with the aforementioned trend than the western gmc . in cases of spontaneous star formation",
    ", the masses of ysos do not depend on the masses of stars that were formed earlier in the molecular cloud .",
    "it is thus the cloud properties that determine the types of stars formed , though once massive stars are formed , their energy feedback can trigger further massive star formation as demonstrated in the eastern gmc .",
    "these two factors can naturally result in massive ysos preferentially found in gmcs associated with  regions as the gmcs likely already have conditions to form massive stars and can form even more with the aide of stellar energy feedback .      the correlation or lack thereof between gmc properties in galaxies and their star formation activity is of critical importance to understand galaxy evolution and star formation in general . in particular , we need to understand the physics underlying the empirically observed correlation between star formation rate and gas surface density , the `` schmidt - kennicutt '' ( s - k ) relation ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this correlation is tight when properties are averaged over a kpc or more , but it is difficult to justify why it should hold on sub - kpc scales .",
    "only recently have datasets been rich enough to explore the smaller scales .",
    "the things project @xcite found that whether molecular or total (= molecular + atomic ) gas surface density is a better predictor of star formation depends on which is the dominant phase in that part of the galaxy @xcite , and in molecular regions , star formation scales linearly with h@xmath83 surface density @xcite .",
    "large - scale star formation in a galaxy depends on the formation rate of gmcs and how gmcs collapse to form stars .",
    "theoretical models assuming that gmcs have a constant star formation efficiency within a free - fall timescale find that gmc formation is the dominant driver in the star formation rate ( sfr ) in galaxies , and that the s - k relation can be reproduced @xcite .",

    "the current star formation activity appears to correlate more with the energy feedback from antecedent massive stars than the mass of a gmc .",
    "@xcite found that in the molecular ridge , the sfr measured from either integrated mid - ir light or detailed analysis of the ysos is correlated with the @xmath149 ratio , an indicator of gravitational support .",
    "however , the total sfr measured from the integrated light is far below that expected from the s - k relation for the given gmc surface density .",
    "the molecular ridge is known for its anomalously low star formation activity , but the gmcs in n44 and n159 host a range of star formation activities and may be used to investigate whether the s - k relation applies on scales of individual gmcs .",
    "the known massive yso content allows us to assess the instantaneous star formation efficiency , sfe@xmath150 , of a gmc .",
    "we use the number counts of ysos within different mass bins and the assumption of salpeter s initial mass function ( imf ) to estimate the total mass of the current star formation , @xmath151 .",
    "the lowest mass bin used for counting depends on the photometric completeness in a region . for regions with bright diffuse background , such as n159-w and n44-c ,",

    "although we can constrain the age of each massive yso from its evolutionary stage , statistics of solar - mass ysos in class i , ii , iii , and models of high - mass protostellar accretion , such ages are quite uncertain aside from being @xmath72 1 myr .",
    "on the other hand , since we consider all ysos with high and intermediate masses within each gmc that are currently forming in a burst , this seems more relevant to the formation timescale of a cluster or association . proceeding with this assumption and assigning a cluster formation time ( @xmath156 ) of @xmath157 myr ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "star formation occurred mostly in lower - mass or less rich clusters .",

    "the ratios of current - to - past massive star formation rates , sfr@xmath150/sfr@xmath173 , of these four gmcs range from 0.4 to 2.1 .",

    "the atomic surface densities are measured from hi maps @xcite .",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig : sfr ] , among the six gmcs , four of them have sfr@xmath180 and sfr@xmath173 in agreement within a factor of 3 .",
    "the remaining two gmcs , n44-n and n159-s , have sfr@xmath181 and 56 times sfr@xmath173 , respectively .",
    "when compared with sfr@xmath150 , which is a better estimate of sfrs in these two low - luminosity regions , n44-n is within a factor of 2 of sfr@xmath180 , while n159-s is still only @xmath182 sfr@xmath180 .",
    "the gmc n159-s appears very different from the other five gmcs as its star formation rate , estimated with a comprehensive yso inventory , is still much lower than that expected from the s - k relation .",
    "it is known that the s - k relation does not apply to small regions ; thus is is not surprising that these gmcs with region sizes ranging from 45 to 135 pc do not follow the s - k relation in star formation .",
    "it is interesting that the sfr averaged over all gmcs within the entire n44 complex or the entire n159 complex is very close to that expected from the s - k relation .",
    "we have studied the  complex n159 in the lmc with _ spitzer _",

    ", we first identified ysos using the criteria [ 4.5]@xmath22[8.0 ] @xmath183 to exclude normal and evolved stars and [ 8.0 ] @xmath2 14.0@xmath22([4.5]@xmath22[8.0 ] ) to exclude background galaxies .",
    "a total of 52 yso candidates were identified .",
    "we then inspected the sed and close - up images of each yso candidate in h@xmath0 , @xmath184 , irac , and mips bands simultaneously to further identify evolved stars , galaxies , and dust clumps , resulting a sample of 27 yso candidates that are most likely bona fide ysos of high and intermediate masses .",
    "we classified these ysos into type i , ii , and iii according to their sed shapes .    in our sample of 27 ysos , @xmath185% of them",
    "are resolved into multiple components or extended sources in high - resolution @xmath27 images . to assess the physical properties of the ysos",
    ", we have used the online sed model fitter @xcite to model seds of these ysos and further analyzed in detail 22 ysos that appear single or dominant within a group .",
    "we find good fits for types i and ii ysos , though they show modest deviations between their observed seds and the models at 5.8 and 8.0@xmath1 m , because the models do not include pah emission .",
    "we have used a yso with a _ spitzer _ irs observation to estimate the fraction of pah emission in irac 3.6 , 5.8 , and 8.0 @xmath1 m  bands and modeled the sed with aromatic emission removed . that sed is well fit by the models , and comparisons between seds before and after pah correction show that mass and total luminosity of the yso is not significantly affected by including pahs in models .",
    "some of the type iii ysos show large deviations from the models at optical wavelengths .",
    "this is due to the modest angular resolution of the mcps @xmath14 catalog since the nebular line emission from small  regions surrounding massive ysos is not resolved from the point source and contributes to the broad - band photometry .",
    "we have also examined the effect of multiplicity ( due to inadequate angular resolution ) on inferring parameters of ysos from sed fits by modeling a group of ysos resolved in the vlt / naco adaptive optics @xmath27 images .",
    "we find that for a yso of multiple sources at similar evolutionary stages , the integrated fluxes may result in up to 20% over - estimate in mass of the most massive component , but up to @xmath17 40% under - estimate in the total mass of the system .",
    "for a yso of sources at mixed evolutionary stages , the mid - ir luminosity is a good estimate for the system s total luminosity , but high - resolution optical and near - ir images are needed to separate main - sequence components from the yso components .",
    "yso counterparts are found in one maser , three uchiis , and nine candidate haebe stars .",
    "the maser is associated with a type i yso and the majority of the haebe stars correspond to type ii and iii ysos , supporting the evolutionary sequence of our empirical classification .",
    "the maser has irs spectral features similar to the `` p '' group classification used in @xcite , while the three uchiis are similar to the `` pe '' group .",
    "masers are typically associated with ysos less evolved than uchiis , supporting the proposed spectral evolutionary sequence that ysos with the `` pe '' spectral type are more evolved than those with the `` p '' spectral type . we have further found that for ysos associated with ultracompact  regions , ( proto ) stellar masses determined from sed model fits agree well with those estimated from the ionization requirements of the  regions . using the sed model fits",
    ", we find at least 9 o - type ysos in n159 .",
    "n159 encompasses three molecular concentrations with different star formation histories and intensities .",
    "o - type ysos are found in the two gmcs that are associated with ionized gas , i.e. , where massive stars have formed a few myr ago , while no o - type ysos are found in the third gmc that shows no signs of massive star formation in the optical and near - ir wavelengths .",
    "this result is similar to that seen in ysos in the three gmcs in n44 ( paper i ) , indicating that energy feedback plays a role in the formation of massive ysos .",
    "however it remains unclear whether the less active gmcs will form massive stars later .",
    "although the uncertainties in @xmath113 are large , the gmc n159-w does have the smallest @xmath113 and @xmath149 ratio and also contains the largest number and most concentrated distribution of ysos , consistent with the hypothesis that concentrated clusters are formed in a less gravitationally stable region .",
    "a smaller @xmath149 ratio is also found in the gmc n44-c which has the highest number and the most concentrated distribution of ysos .    to investigate whether star formation may be triggered or spontaneous in gmcs in n159",
    ", we have performed a detailed comparison between the mid - ir yso distribution and the distribution of already formed massive stars and their associated ionized gas .",
    "we find that the current star formation in the gmc n159-e is likely to be triggered by  regions expanding into the molecular cloud , while the massive ysos in gmc n159-w are more likely forming spontaneously .    finally , we estimated star formation efficiencies and rates by counting the massive ysos , and compared these rates to those inferred from integrated h@xmath0  and 24 @xmath1 m  luminosities .",
    "we also compared with expected rates calculated from gas surface densities and using the schmidt - kennicutt extragalactic scaling relation . in gmcs with relatively high levels of activity , such as n159-e and -w ,",
    "the various measures are consistent . however , in more quiescent regions such as n159-s and the giant molecular ridge which continues south from there , we find that star formation is distributed in relatively low luminosity regions and dominated by current ( mid - ir detected ) star formation , with a lack of massive main - sequence stars ( representing few - myr old activity ) .",
    "star formation rates derived from yso counting are higher than those predicted by total h@xmath0  and 24 @xmath1 m  luminosities , and both are lower than would be implied by the total gas surface density .",
    "this discrepancy can be explained if the star formation sites are poor clusters which do not fully sample the stellar mass function ( so their mass - to - light ratios are elevated ) .",
    "alternatively , the youngest and most embedded still accreting massive protostars have elevated mass - to - light ratios due to late spectral type pre - main - sequence photospheres and possible having not yet accreted their final mass .",
    "either possibility indicates unusual conditions in n159-s and a breakdown of the scaling laws determined by averaging over kiloparsec scales in galaxies .",
    "detailed studies such as this of archival _ spitzer _ data , soon to be complemented by detailed molecular gas properties obtained with alma , are revealing the full complexity of extragalactic star formation .",

    "<S> the  complex n159 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) is used to study massive star formation in different environments , as it contains three giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) that have similar sizes and masses but exhibit different intensities of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we identify candidate massive young stellar objects ( ysos ) using infrared photometry , and model their seds to constrain mass and evolutionary state . </S>",
    "<S> good fits are obtained for less evolved type i , i / ii , and ii sources . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis suggests that there are massive embedded ysos in n159b , a maser source , and several ultracompact  regions . </S>",
    "<S> massive o - type ysos are found in gmcs n159-e and n159-w , which are associated with ionized gas , i.e. , where massive stars formed a few myr ago . </S>",
    "<S> the third gmc , n159-s , has neither o - type ysos nor evidence of previous massive star formation . </S>",
    "<S> this correlation between current and antecedent formation of massive stars suggests that energy feedback is relevant . </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence that n159-w is forming ysos spontaneously , while collapse in n159-e may be triggered . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare star formation rates determined from yso counts with those from integrated h@xmath0  and 24 @xmath1 m  luminosities and expected from gas surface densities . detailed dissection of extragalactic gmcs like the one presented here is key to revealing the physics underlying commonly used star formation scaling laws . </S>"
