    "the phenomenon of coherent population trapping , originating from quantum optics , has recently been recognized as a useful and interesting concept in the electronic context as well.@xcite an all - electronic implementation , proposed in ref .  ,",
    "is based on destructive interference of single - electron tunneling between three quantum dots ( see fig.[fig:3dot ] ) .",
    "the trapped state is a coherent superposition of the electronic charge in two of these quantum dots , so it is destabilized as a result of decoherence by coupling to external charges . in the limit of weak decoherence one electron is transferred _ on average _ through the device for each decoherence event .    in an experimental breakthrough,@xcite gustavsson",
    "have now reported real - time detection of single - electron tunneling , obtaining the full statistics of the number of transferred charges in a given time interval .",
    "the first two moments of the counting statistics give the mean current and the noise power , and higher moments further specify the correlations between the tunneling electrons.@xcite this recent development provides a motivation to investigate the counting statistics of coherent population trapping , going beyond the first moment studied in ref ..    since the statistics of the decoherence events is poissonian , one might surmise that the charge counting statistics would be poissonian as well .",
    "in contrast , we find that charges are transferred in bunches instead of independently as in a poisson process .",
    "the fano factor ( ratio of noise power and mean current ) is three times the poisson value in the limit of weak decoherence .",
    "we identify the physical origin of this super - poissonian noise in the alternation of two decay processes ( tunnel events and decoherence events ) with very different time scales  in accord with the general theory of belzig.@xcite for comparable tunnel and decoherence rates the noise becomes sub - poissonian , while the poisson distribution is approached for strong decoherence .",
    "the analysis of ref .   was based on the lindblad master equation for electron transport,@xcite which determines only the average number of transferred charges .",
    "the full counting statistics can be obtained by an extension of the master equation due to bagrets and nazarov@xcite ( without phase coherence ) and to kielich et al.@xcite ( with phase coherence ) . in spite of the added complexity",

    "electron tunneling from the source reservoir into the dots and from the dots into the drain reservoir is irreversible .",
    "we assume that a single level in each dot lies within range of the bias voltage .",

    "the quantum jump operators @xmath12 model irreversible tunneling out of and into the reservoirs , with a rate @xmath0 ( which we again take the same for each dot ) . finally , the quantum jump operators @xmath13 model decoherence due to charge noise with a rate @xmath14 .    as a basis for the the density matrix we use the four states @xmath15",

    "]      for decoherence rate @xmath43 we have the limiting behavior @xmath44 hence one charge is transferred on average per decoherence event , but the fano factor is three times the value for independent charge transfers .",

    "the system becomes trapped in the state @xmath45 .",
    "the system is untrapped by `` decoherence events '' , which occur randomly at the rate @xmath14 according to poisson statistics .",
    "if @xmath14 is sufficiently small there is enough time for the system to decay into the trapped state between two subsequent events , so they can be viewed as independent .",
    "the super - poissonian statistics appears because a single decoherence event can trigger the transfer of more than a single charge .",
    "the probability of @xmath46 electrons being transferred in total as a consequence of one decoherence event is @xmath47 since a decoherence event projects the trapped state @xmath45 onto itself or onto @xmath48 with equal probabilities @xmath49 and each electron subsequently entering the dots has a 50% chance of getting trapped in the state @xmath45 .",
    "the number of electrons which have been transferred due to exactly @xmath50 decoherence events has distribution @xmath51 , the @xmath52th convolution of @xmath53 with itself .",
    "we get @xmath54 by definition , @xmath55 being the distribution of the transferred charges after no decoherence events have occurred .",

    "( [ eq : weak ] ) .",
    "the probability distribution ( [ eq : cgf - low - decoh ] ) has been found by belzig in a different model.@xcite as shown in that paper , this superposition of poisson distributions with fano factor 3 arises generically whenever there are two transport channels with very different transport rates ( in our case slow transport via the trapped state @xmath45 , and fast transport via the untrapped state @xmath48 ) .",
    "we show that poisson statistics of the transferred charges is obtained for strong decoherence .",
    "consider the evolution equation ( [ eq : dotv ] ) of the system .",
    "for @xmath60 the coefficients @xmath61 , and @xmath62 will ensure that @xmath63 is equal to @xmath64 after a time which is short compared to the other characteristic times of the system . the trapped and the non - trapped states will be equally populated .",

    "the evolution of @xmath67 is governed by @xmath68 , with @xmath69 the rate matrix @xmath70 is obtained by multiplying @xmath71 by the counting factor @xmath29 .",
    "an analytic expression can be found for the smallest eigenvalue @xmath72 of @xmath70 , leading to the cumulant generating function @xmath73 of a poisson distribution .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that coherent population trapping in a purely electronic system has a highly nontrivial statistics of transferred charges . depending on the ratios of decoherence rate and tunnel rates , both super - poissonian and sub - poissonian statistics are possible .",
    "we have obtained exact analytical solutions for the crossover from sub- to super - poissonian charge transfer , and have calculated the full distribution in the limits of weak and strong decoherence .",
    "we hope that the rich behavior of this simple device will motivate experimental work along the lines of ref . and .",

    "we also express the eigenvector @xmath76 corresponding to @xmath77 and the matrix itself in a power series in @xmath30 : @xmath78 inserting the above expansions into the eigenvalue equation @xmath79 yields the following relationships of respectively zeroth , first and second order : @xmath80 the coefficients @xmath81 are known , while @xmath82 and @xmath83 remain to be found by solving these equations sequentially .",
