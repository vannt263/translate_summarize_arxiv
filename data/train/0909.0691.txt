    "the characterization of accretion disks around young high - mass protostars is one of the main unsolved questions in high - mass star formation research @xcite .",
    "the controversy arises around the difficulty to accumulate mass onto a high - mass protostar when it gets larger than 8m@xmath4 because the radiation pressure of the growing protostar may be strong enough to revert the gas inflow ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "different ways to circumvent this problem are proposed , the main are disk accretion from a turbulent gas and dust core ( e.g. , @xcite ) , competitive accretion and potential ( proto)stellar mergers at the dense centers of evolving high - mass ( proto)clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and ionized accretion flows continuing through the hypercompact hii region phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    over recent years , much indirect evidence has been accumulated that high - mass accretion disks do exist .",
    "the main argument stems from high - mass molecular outflow observations that identify collimated and energetic outflows from high - mass protostars , resembling the properties of known low - mass star formation sites ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such collimated jet - like outflow structures are only explainable if one assumes an underlying high - mass accretion disk that drives these outflows via magneto - centrifugal acceleration . from a theoretical modeling approach , recent 2d and 3d magneto - hydrodynamical simulations of high - mass collapsing gas cores",
    "result in the formation of high - mass accretion disks as well @xcite .",
    "although alternative formation scenarios are proposed , there appears to be a growing concensus in the high - mass star formation community that accretion disks should also exist in high - mass star formation .",
    "however , it is still poorly known whether such high - mass disks are similar to their low - mass counterparts , hence dominated by the central protostar and in keplerian rotation , or whether they are perhaps self - gravitating non - keplerian entities .",
    "while the indirect evidence for high - mass accretion disks is steadily increasing , direct observational studies are largely missing .",
    "this lack of observational evidence can be attributed to two main reasons .",
    "the first is the clustered mode of high - mass star formation and the typically large distances , hence spatially resolving and disentangling such structures is a difficult task .",
    "the second difficulty is to choose the right spectral line tracer which allows unambiguous identification and characterization of the disk structure",
    ". many spectral lines are either optically thick ( e.g. , co , hco@xmath5 , cs ) , chemically difficult to interpret ( e.g. , hc@xmath0n , hnco ) or excited in the envelope and disk which causes confusion ( e.g. , hcn , ch@xmath0cn ) .",
    "to overcome these problems , we used the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) at 1.2 cm wavelengths including the most extended baselines ( resulting in a spatial resolution @xmath6 ) , and we aimed at the highly excited nh@xmath0(j , k ) inversion lines ( 4,4 ) and ( 5,5 ) .",
    "nh@xmath0 is known to be a dense core tracer ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and the high ( j , k ) inversion lines with excitation temperatures ( @xmath7 ) of 200 and 295k , respectively , should only be excited in the innermost and warm region close to the central protostars .",
    "similarly , @xcite also modeled the nh@xmath0(4,4 ) emission of the collapsing hot core g31.41 .",
    "furthermore , radiation transfer calculations for 3d hydro - simulations revealed that the 1.2 cm band regime should be particularly well suited for such studies because the inner disk regions may be optically thick at frequencies above about 100ghz @xcite .",
    "this may make future high - mass disk studies of the innermost regions at shorter wavelengths with alma difficult .",
    "therefore , studying these lines at high angular resolution with the atca allows us to penetrate deeply into the natal cores and study the physical properties of the predicted high - mass accretion disks .    over the last few years",
    "there have been a lot of `` trial and error '' approaches for high - mass disk studies , but no consistent investigation of a larger sample is public so far .",
    "since the above outlined approach has been proven very successful in the recent atca high-(j , k ) nh@xmath0 study of iras18089 - 1732 @xcite , we are now aiming at a source sample of twelve promising disk candidates mainly identified by previous lower resolution nh@xmath0 studies of 41 sources using the atca @xcite and 60 sources using mopra ( walsh et al .",
    "priv .  comm . ) .",
    "the proposed sources comprise the best high - mass - disk - candidate sample for the southern hemisphere to date ( sec .",
    "[ sample ] ) .",
    "our sample of twelve sources ( see table [ tablesample ] ) was observed during six consecutive nights between july 1st and 7th 2008 .",
    "we always observed two sources per night in a track - sharing mode cycling between the gain calibrators and sources .",
    "table [ tablesample ] lists the corresponding gain calibrators ( phase and amplitude ) for each pair of sources .",
    "simultaneously , we observed the nh@xmath0(4,4 ) and ( 5,5 ) inversion lines with the frequencies of the main hyperfine components at 24.139 and 24.533ghz , respectively . the phase reference centers and velocities relative to the local standard of rest ( @xmath8 )",
    "are given in table [ tablesample ] .",
    "bandpass and flux were calibrated with observations of 1253 - 055 and 1934 - 638 .",
    "the spectral resolution of the observations was 62khz corresponding to a velocity resolution of @xmath9kms@xmath10 .",
    "the observations were conducted in the 1.5d configuration including antenna 6 which resulted in a maximum baseline length of 4.3 km .",
    "depending on the source structure ( e.g. , compact versus extended ) and strength we applied different weightings ( robust values between -2 and 2 ) for each source and line .",
    "to better trace faint and/or extended features , we occasionally excluded antenna 6  and hence the longest baselines   from the imaging process ( table [ tablesample2 ] ) .",
    "the synthesized beams and rms are given in table [ tablesample2 ] .",
    ".observational parameters ii [ cols= \" < , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ results ]",
    "we present a large observing campaign to search for rotational motions in high - mass star - forming regions via high - excitation nh@xmath0 line observation with high spatial resolution . while we detect all sources from the original sample ( excluding the one source that was chosen via other selection criteria ) , in more than 50% of them rotational and/or infall motions can be identified .",
    "several more general conclusions can be drawn from this observing campaign .",
    "+ ( a ) high - excitation nh@xmath0 lines are very good tracers of the dense gas within hot - core type young high - mass star - forming regions . in this sample , the nh@xmath0(4,4 ) and ( 5,5 ) emission is always associated with the ch@xmath0oh class ii methanol maser emission , which is a well - known signpost for high - mass star formation .",
    "+ ( b ) we identify rotational / infalling motions in half of the observed sources . + ( c ) the signatures comprise simple velocity gradients as well as more spherical infall signatures",
    ". + ( d ) although the spatial resolution is of order a few 1000au , we do not identify obvious keplerian signatures .",
    "+ ( e ) while high optical depth is an issue , the data nevertheless indicate that accretion disks resembling those of low - mass star - forming regions ( e.g. , @xcite ) have to be typically of smaller sizes , not yet resolved by our observations .",
    "likely such smaller accretion disks could be fed by the rotating envelopes observed here .",
    "+ ( f ) in many fields of view we do detect additional hii regions that are not directly linked to our targets but that reside in the same projected area on the sky .",
    "this is additional evidence for the clustered mode of high - mass star formation .",
    "+ where to go from here ?",
    "clearly there are different paths to be followed .",
    "while our approach for this study was biased toward hot - core type sources based on our spectral line selection criteria , other observational approaches can target sources in different evolutionary stages as well as of different luminosities . in particular , observations at mm wavelengths with broad spectral bandpasses allow us to observe several spectral lines simultaneously which can trace rotational motions in sources of different characteristics ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for example , qizhou zhang and collaborators started a similarly large project searching for disk signatures toward a sample of young high - mass star - forming regions with the submillimeter array , and they also detected rotational signatures toward all targets ( qizhou zhang et al .",
    ", in prep . ) .",
    "while as outlined in section [ general ] flattened structures do exist on scales exceeding @xmath2au , most data indicate that the keplerian accretion disks should reside on smaller scales , probably @xmath11au .",
    "this is also shown in the recent 3-dimensional radiative hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite where most of the disk - like structures are contained with a radius of @xmath1500au .",
    "furthermore , recent work has also shown that accretion disks exceeding 150au are prone to fragmentation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , hence , it is not even expected to find keplerian signatures on much larger scales .",
    "while we can already achieve tremendous progress with the existing instrumentation , clearly we are still lacking spatial resolution if we want to understand the structure and physical processes of the more proper central accretion disks .",
    "future instruments like alma and evla will allow us to make considerable progress in this direction for the cold gas components .",
    "furthermore , due to the large accretion rates , strong viscous forces and central luminous sources , a considerable fraction of warm / hot gas is expected to exist with the high - mass disks .",
    "therefore , imaging these warm / hot dust and gas components at high spatial resolution with future instruments like miri on jwst will allow us to constrain the properties of these components in much more detail .",
    "it is likely that only a concerted effort at long and short wavelengths combined with hydrodynamic and radiation transfer modeling will give us a real understanding of the working of high - mass accretion disks .",
