    "carbon nanotubes have been in the forefront of the nanomaterial research since their discovery @xcite .",

    "there is an active ongoing work in these fields to exploit the properties of these materials better and to improve the device qualities .",
    "furthermore , high expectations are related to their applications as building elements of electronics , composite reinforcing materials and many more .",
    "carbon nanotubes can be represented as rolled up graphene sheets , i.e. single layers of graphite .",
    "depending on the number of coaxial carbon nanotubes , they are usually classified into multi - wall carbon nanotubes ( mwcnts ) and single wall carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) .",
    "some general considerations have been clearified in the last 13 years of nanomaterial research related to these structures .",
    "mwcnts are more homogeneous in their physical properties as the large number of coaxial tubes smears out individual tube properties .",
    "this makes them suitable candidates for applications where their nanometer size and the conducting properties can be exploited .",
    "in contrast , swcnt materials are grown as an ensemble of weakly interacting tubes with different diameters .",
    "the physical properties of similar diameter swcnts can change dramatically as the electronic structure is very sensitive on the rolling - up direction , the so - called chiral vector . depending on the chiral vector",
    ", swcnts can be metallic or semiconducting @xcite .",
    "this provides a richer range of physical phenomena as compared to the mwcnts , however significantly limits the range of applications . to date , neither the directed growth nor the controlled selection of swcnts with a well defined chiral vector has been performed successfully .",
    "thus , their broad applicability is still awaiting .",
    "correspondingly , current reserach is focused on the post - synthesis separation of swcnts with a narrow range of chiralities chattopadhyayjacs@xcite@xcite@xcite or on methods which yield information that are specific to swcnts with different chiralities .",
    "an example for the latter is the observation of chirality selective band - gap fluorescence in semiconducting swcnts @xcite .",
    "a more recently discovered third class of cnts are double - wall carbon nanotubes ( dwcnts ) .",
    "dwcnts were first observed to form under intensive electron radiation @xcite in a high resolution transmission electron microscope from c@xmath0 encapsulated in swcnts , so - called peapods @xcite . following the synthesis of c@xmath0 peapods in macroscopic amounts @xcite , bulk quantities of the dwcnt material are available using a high temperature annealing method @xcite .",
    "alternatively , dwcnts can be produced with usual synthesis methods such as arc - discharge @xcite or cvd @xcite under special conditions . according to the number of shells ,",
    "dwcnts are between swcnts and mwcnts .",
    "thus , one expects that dwcnts may provide a material where improved mechanical stability as compared to swcnts coexists with the rich variety of electronic properties of swcnts .",
    "there are , of course , a number of yet unanswered questions e.g. if the outer tube properties are unaffected by the presence of the inner tube or if the commensurability of the tube structures plays a role .",
    "these questions should be answered before the successful application of these materials .    in this contribution",

    "we show that the study of inner tubes , in particular those from c@xmath0 peapod based dwcnts provides some unique insight into the physics of swcnts .",

    "<S> raman spectroscopy on carbon nanotubes ( cnt ) yields a rich variety of information owing to the close interplay between electronic and vibrational properties . in this paper , we review the properties of double wall carbon nanotubes ( dwcnts ) . in particular , it is shown that swcnt encapsulating c@xmath0 , so - called peapods , are transformed into dwcnts when subject to a high temperature treatment . </S>",
    "<S> the inner tubes are grown in a catalyst free environment and do not suffer from impurities or defects that are usually encountered for as - grown swcnts or dwcnts . </S>",
    "<S> as a consequence , the inner tubes are grown with a high degree of perfection as deduced from the unusually narrow radial breathing mode ( rbm ) lines . </S>",
    "<S> this apostrophizes the interior of the swcnts as a nano - clean room . </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism of the inner nanotube production from c@xmath0 is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> we also report recent studies aimed at the simplification and industrial scaling up of the dwcnt production process utilizing a low temperature peapod synthesis method . </S>",
    "<S> a splitting of the rbms of inner tubes is observed . </S>",
    "<S> this is related to the interaction between the two shells of the dwcnts as the same inner tube type can be encapsulated in different outer ones . </S>",
    "<S> the sharp appearance of the inner tube rbms allows a reliable assignment of the tube modes to ( n , m ) indexes and thus provides a precise determination of the relation between the tube diameter and the rbm frequencies . </S>"
