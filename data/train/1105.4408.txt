    "as a sampling paradigm guaranteeing the reconstruction of sparse signal with sampling rate significantly lower than the nyquist rate , compressive sensing ( cs ) has received considerable attention in recent years @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "the main goal of the cs is to accurately reconstruct a high dimensional sparse vector using a small number linear measurements .",
    "specifically , for a given matrix @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) , the cs recovery algorithm generates an estimate of @xmath1-sparse vector @xmath4 from a set of linear measurements @xmath5 although this task seems to be a severely ill - posed inverse problem , due to the prior knowledge of sparsity information , @xmath6 can be perfectly reconstructed via properly designed recovery algorithm . among many greedy search algorithms developed for this purpose",
    ", omp algorithm has received special attention due to its simplicity and competitive reconstruction performance @xcite .",
    "theoretical analysis of omp to date has concentrated primarily on two fronts .",
    "the first approach is based on the restricted isometric property ( rip ) . a sensing matrix @xmath7 satisfies",
    "the rip of order @xmath1 if there exists a constant @xmath8 such that @xcite @xmath9 for any @xmath1-sparse vector @xmath6 ( @xmath10 ) . in particular , the minimum of all constants @xmath8 satisfying ( [ eq : rip ] ) is called the isometry constant @xmath11 .",
    "wakin and davenport have shown that the omp can reconstruct all @xmath1-sparse signals if @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this result has been recently improved by wang and shim to @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the second approach is based on the coherence parameter .",
    "the coherence parameter @xmath14 of the sensing matrix @xmath15 is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are two column vectors of @xmath15 .",
    "when the columns of @xmath7 have unit norm and satisfy the mutual incoherence condition given by @xmath19 , the omp will recover @xmath1-sparse signal x from the measurements @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "it is well known that this result is also applied to @xmath21-minimization approach @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we provide a simple proof of the mutual incoherence condition for the omp using mathematical induction .",
    "our proof is built on an observation that the general step of the omp process is in essence same as the initial step since the residual is considered as a new measurement preserving the sparsity level of an input vector .",
    "the mutual incoherence condition for the omp is formally described in the following theorem .",
    ".omp algorithm [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     [ general ] for any @xmath1-sparse vector @xmath6 , the omp algorithm perfectly recovers @xmath6 from the measurements @xmath22 if the coherence parameter @xmath14 satisfies @xmath23",
    "before presenting the proof of theorem [ general ] , we provide lemmas useful in our analysis .    [",
    "lem : norm ] for @xmath24 and @xmath25 in @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 , following inequalities are satisfied : @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the spectral norm of @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the maximum absolute value of elements of @xmath35 ( i.e. , @xmath37 ) .        using lemma [ lem :",
    "norm ] , we have @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the support of @xmath6 ( a set with the locations of the non - zero elements of @xmath6 ) , @xmath48 is a vector composed of the elements of @xmath6 indexed by @xmath47 . noting that @xmath49-th element of @xmath50 is @xmath51 and @xmath52 is the unit norm vector , it is clear that @xmath53 now , let @xmath54 then @xmath55 and thus @xmath56 .",
    "hence , @xmath57 where ( [ eq : xx3 ] ) is from lemma [ lem : norm ] . using ( [ eq : lemma2 ] ) and ( [ eq : xx4 ] ) , we have @xmath58 recalling the definition of the rip that @xmath44 is the minimum satisfying ( [ eq : rip ] ) , we have @xmath45    we will prove the theorem using induction .",
    "in the first iteration ( @xmath59 ) of the omp algorithm , @xmath60 becomes the index of the column maximally correlated with the measurement @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 then , we have @xmath63 where ( [ eq : zz3 ] ) is due to @xmath64 , ( [ eq : zz4 ] ) and ( [ eq : zz5 ] ) follow from lemma [ lem : rips ] and [ lem : rip_mip ] , respectively .    now",
    ", suppose that @xmath65 is not belonging to the support of @xmath66 ( i.e. , @xmath67 ) , then @xmath68 where ( [ eq : uu4 ] ) is from the definition of @xmath14 ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "this case , however , will never occur if @xmath70 or @xmath71 in summary , if @xmath72 , then @xmath73 for the first iteration of the omp algorithm .",
    "now we assume that the former @xmath74 iterations are successful ( @xmath75 ) for @xmath76 .",
    "then it suffices to show that @xmath77 is in @xmath47 but not in @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "recall from table [ omp ] that the residual at the @xmath74-th iteration of the omp is @xmath80 since @xmath64 and @xmath81 is a submatrix of @xmath82 , @xmath83 and thus @xmath84 can be expressed as a linear combination of the @xmath85 ( @xmath86 ) columns of @xmath87 .",
    "accordingly , we can express @xmath84 as @xmath88 where the support ( set of indices for nonzero elements ) of @xmath89 is contained in the support of @xmath6 . in this sense , it is natural to interpret that @xmath84 is a measurement of @xmath1-sparse signal @xmath89 using the sensing matrix @xmath7 .",
    "thus , if ( [ eq : sufficient ] ) is satisfied , we guarantee that @xmath90 at the @xmath91-th iteration . noting that the residual @xmath84 is orthogonal to the columns already selected is a projection of @xmath92 , the error vector @xmath93 ( which equals @xmath84 ) is orthogonal to the projection @xmath94 . ] , index of these columns is not selected again ( see the identify step in table i ) and hence @xmath79 .",
    "this concludes the proof .",
    "thus far , we have shown that the omp algorithm is working perfectly if the sensing matrix @xmath7 satisfies the condition @xmath72 .",
    "interestingly , this condition is not only sufficient but also necessary .",
    "we prove this claim by showing that , even with slight relaxation of this condition ( @xmath95 ) , it is possible that the omp algorithm can not perfectly recover @xmath1-sparse signal .",
    "note that our construction of @xmath7 is similar to cai , wang , and xu s work for proving the tightness of mutual incoherence condition for @xmath21-minimization ( * ? ? ?",
    "* remark 3.2 ) .",
    "suppose @xmath7 has normalized columns ( @xmath96 ) and also satisfies @xmath97 .",
    "then it is clear that @xmath98 has a unit diagonal and the absolute value of the off - diagonal elements is upper bounded by @xmath99 .",
    "now consider @xmath100 then @xmath101 is symmetric and positive semi - definite matrix , and hence @xmath102 can be found by an eigen - decomposition of @xmath103@xcite .",
    "note that an @xmath104 matrix @xmath105 with @xmath106 and @xmath107 for @xmath108 is invertible if and only if @xmath109 .",
    "hence , for @xmath110 and @xmath111 , @xmath101 is not invertible for the choice of @xmath112 . in this case ,",
    "eigen - decomposition of @xmath113 becomes @xmath114 and @xmath115 where @xmath116 and @xmath117 are @xmath118 nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath119 .",
    "since the rank of @xmath102 is @xmath120 , there exists a vector @xmath121 ( which by definition is @xmath122-sparse vector ) in the null space of @xmath123 obeying @xmath124 .",
    "one can then divide @xmath125 into two @xmath1-sparse vectors @xmath126 and @xmath127 ( i.e. , @xmath128 ) .",
    "this gives @xmath129 so that the omp algorithm fails to recover @xmath1-sparse vector .",
    "in fact , no reconstruction algorithm can always guarantee the perfect recovery of @xmath1-sparse vector under @xmath97 .",
