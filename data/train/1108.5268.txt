    "the study of frustrated quantum magnets is a fascinating subject that has stimulated many studies within the condensed matter community in recent years.@xcite such systems are assumed to be the main candidates for a rich variety of unconventional phases and phase transitions such as spin liquids and critical points with de - confined fractional excitations.@xcite frustration can also play an important rle in classical systems .",
    "the phenomenon of order - by - disorder @xcite is the perfect example where the interplay of frustration and fluctuations produces the emergence of unexpected order .",
    "order - by - disorder implies that a certain low - temperature configuration is favored by its high entropy , not by its low energy .",
    "order - by - disorder can also occur in a quantum system , where a nave argument suggests that quantum fluctuations play the same rle as thermal fluctuations in the classical system , albeit there are counterexamples where their rle is in fact quite different.@xcite    a particularly illustrative example is provided by the spin @xmath0 antiferromagnet on the  lattice .",
    "a spin gap appears to be present both at zero magnetization @xcite ( see , however , refs .  ) and at @xmath8 of the saturation value where it gives rise to a plateau in the magnetization curve .",
    "@xcite one would be tempted to believe that the nature of the ground state is similar in both cases . however , whether the ground state at zero field is ordered or not is still under debate and also the existence of a plateau in the isotropic spin 1/2 heisenberg model at magnetization @xmath8 has been questioned recently.@xcite nevertheless , the existence of a plateau at magnetization @xmath8 is quite clear for easy - axis exchange anisotropies@xcite and , using a correspondence with a quantum dimer model on the honeycomb lattice,@xcite the ground state is identified as an ordered array of resonating spins.@xcite    in this paper we study an effective model that arises in the strong trimerization limit of the spin @xmath0",
    "antiferromagnet.@xcite this model has played an important rle in analyzing the zero - field properties of the  antiferromagnet,@xcite but here we will focus on magnetization @xmath8 of the heisenberg model , corresponding to full polarization of the physical spin degrees in the effective model .",
    "thus , we are left with the chirality degrees of freedom of the original antiferromagnet which we will treat as ` spin ' variables . in this sense",
    "our spin system can be considered as a purely orbital model similar to compass models recently considered in the literature ( see , e.g. , refs . ) . as an experimental realization of this model a system of spin - polarized fermions trapped in a trimerized optical  lattice at @xmath1 occupancy has been suggested .",
    "@xcite in fact , experimental realization of an optical  lattice has been reported recently,@xcite albeit using a setup which does not allow direct control of trimerization .    beyond the particular realizations of our model",
    "its very rich physics which results from the interplay between classical and quantum fluctuations and frustration makes it an interesting model in its own right .",
    "as will be shown in this paper , a hamiltonian with an ( unusual ) discrete symmetry but with a continuous degeneracy of the classical ground state , as it would be expected for a hamiltonian with a continuous symmetry , is just one aspect of the rich phenomena emerging from this model .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : hsym ] we present the hamiltonian and the symmetries of the classical and spin @xmath0 cases .",
    "the hamiltonian can be defined for both signs of the coupling constant @xmath2 .",
    "we deliberately discuss in parallel the two cases throughout the entire paper to point out their similarities and differences .",
    "the spin @xmath0 case is then treated in section [ seced ] by means of exact diagonalization techniques , and we argue that a finite - temperature phase transition takes place .",
    "since exact diagonalization can access only small lattices , we move to the classical model in section [ seccl ] .",
    "we study in detail the manifold of lowest - energy configurations and their corresponding spin - wave spectra .",
    "the effect of soft modes in the order - by - disorder selection mechanism is argued to be the origin for the phase transition of the @xmath3 case , in contrast to the @xmath4 case , where the transition is of a more conventional purely energetic origin . in section [ secmc ] we apply monte - carlo techniques to the classical model and determine the transition temperature for @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "we also analyze the universality class of the transition , however , only for @xmath4 since the transition temperature for @xmath3 turns out to be so low that it is difficult to access .",

    "a similar derivation starting from a fermi gas with two atoms per trimer also leads to the hamiltonian ( [ eqh]).@xcite    due to the two possible chiralities on each triangle , the pseudo - spin operators @xmath13 should be considered as quantum spin-1/2 operators .",

    "translations @xmath23 , @xmath24 along the two fundamental directions of the lattice .",
    "simultaneous rotation @xmath25 of the lattice and all spins around the @xmath26-axis by angles of @xmath27 ( the latter rotation amounts to a cyclic exchange of @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 ) .",

    "if @xmath25 is a symmetry , we use it to select one representative @xmath52 for all equivalent momenta . finally , the presence of the symmetry @xmath43 is more delicate .",
    "we have performed computer checks and found that most of the lattices under consideration have a suitable spatial reflection symmetry , ensuring that @xmath43 is a symmetry .",
    "the only exception is the @xmath57 lattice where there is no such reflection symmetry .",

    "this result for @xmath77 ( also included in fig .",

    "this fast convergence indicates that there is no phase transition associated to the high - temperature maximum ( the position of this maximum is at @xmath80 with a value @xmath81 for @xmath57 ) .",
    "the reduced finite - size effects and the smaller value of @xmath72 at the maximum reflect that there is a substantially smaller energy scale for @xmath62 as compared to @xmath14 .",

    "although the maximum value of @xmath87 increases with increasing @xmath46 , there are non - systematic finite - size corrections to the position of this maximum .",
