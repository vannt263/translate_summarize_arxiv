    "relativistic heavy ion collisions have been studied for their potential in exploring many aspects of the qcd phase diagram .",
    "the particle production , as measured by experiments such as the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at the brookhaven national laboratory , exhibits transverse momentum spectra that are divided into three regions described by different physical models @xcite .",
    "for instance , particles with relatively low momenta ( @xmath2 ) , which exhibit an exponential distribution , can be understood to be thermalized according to boltzmann statistics .",
    "the intermediate @xmath1 range , @xmath3 , might be considered as coming from quark coalescence and recombination , while the highest momenta @xmath4 could originate from parton fragmentation .",
    "thus , transverse momentum spectra are usually explained differently according to the momentum range considered .",
    "it would be of interest to find a single physical description for measured momentum spectra over the entire @xmath1 range .",
    "this has been attempted before with different approaches .",
    "for instance , a framework of percolation of strings can be used to find a universality in the transverse momentum spectra @xcite .",
    "alternatively , temperature fluctuations have been shown to generate spectra compatible to the ones measured experimentally @xcite . in this work",
    ", we chose to use a non - extensive statistical approach @xcite . in this formalism",
    "the entropy is no longer additive .",
    "when computed in the canonical ensemble , the occupation probabilities are given by    @xmath5^{\\frac{1}{q-1}}\\ ] ]    with @xmath6 being @xmath7^{\\frac{1}{q-1}}\\]]where @xmath8 is the occupation probability of a state with energy @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the number of accessible states , @xmath11 is a real number and `` @xmath12 '' is the non - extensivity parameter , so called because the composition rule for entropy deviates from additiveness by a mixed entropy term proportional to @xmath13 .",
    "these expressions reduce to the boltzmann occupation probabilities in the limit @xmath14 , where entropy also becomes additive as in classical statistical theory .",
    "the probabilities given by equation [ one ] therefore give us an energy distribution , but it is still necessary to relate energy to transverse momentum . to do this ,",
    "we assume a thermal equilibrium of a relativistic gas , as in the hagedorn model , where energy is distributed according to equation [ one ] .",
    "one can then determine the momentum distribution to be @xcite    @xmath15^{\\frac{q}{1-q}}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath16 denotes a real number equal to @xmath17 which is related to the slope of the resulting curve , @xmath18 is the longitudinal momentum and @xmath1 is the transverse momentum of the produced particles , and @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the rest mass , is the so called transverse mass of the produced particles .",
    "this function can be used numerically to adjust transverse momenta .",
    "it is , however , of crucial importance to understand the fit parameters in order to gain physical knowledge of the dynamics at hand .",
    "a dynamical interpretation for the @xmath12-parameter has been suggested in reference @xcite and proposes a discrete dynamical model which can be simulated easily . consider a system consisting of @xmath21 particles , each having energy @xmath22 in multiples of some energy quantum , @xmath23 .",
    "the system evolves in discrete time steps in which two particles @xmath24 and @xmath25 are randomly chosen to be updated and one of the following two updates takes place :    * with probability @xmath26 , the two particles exchange one energy quantum , i.e. @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "if the choice is such that a negative energy should arise , nothing happens and this step is skipped . * with probability @xmath29 ,",
    "the two particles are set to the energy of the lowest original energy , i.e. @xmath30 , and the excess energy is passed on to a third randomly chosen particle , effectively introducing a two - particle correlation .",
    "it is therefore possible , by changing the @xmath29 parameter in the model , to increase or decrease the degree of correlation in the dynamics .",
    "we simulated such systems using @xmath31 in a system saturated with energy , in which the average energy per particle is @xmath32 . in this case",
    ", at least @xmath33 time steps are required in order to attain an energy distribution curve that is stationary .",
    "it is noteworthy that different @xmath21 values change this relaxation time , as more iterations will be needed to attain equilibrium if more particles are present .",
    "this model produces energy distributions that are similar to tsallis energy distribution curves and can be fitted with equation [ one ] , shown in fig .",
    "[ label1]a .",
    "the fit parameters indicate that the @xmath29 value and the adjusted @xmath12 value are closely related ( fig .",
    "[ label1]b ) and the @xmath12 value is indicative of a higher degree of correlation in the dynamics . fig .",
    "[ label1]b also shows that the @xmath16 and @xmath12 parameters are anti - correlated , which can be seen as a reflection of conservation of energy . populating higher energies with a small amount of particles",
    "implies taking this energy from the bulk of the other particles , effectively increasing the slope parameter and decreasing the @xmath16 parameter .",
    "other configurations varying @xmath21 and @xmath34 were also studied and in all cases we observed the same qualitative behaviour for different @xmath29 values .",
    "6.2 in    this toy model also makes the study of event - by - event energy fluctuations possible . by simulating many independent systems and looking at the energy occupation of the @xmath35 energy quanta bin and fitting these data with a gaussian curve",
    ", it can be seen that the fluctuations increase by roughly @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ label1a]a ) when increasing the correlation parameter @xmath29 in the model .",
    "if we normalize the gaussian widths by the mean value , it can be seen ( fig .",
    "[ label1a]b ) that this increase in the @xmath37 values is not due to the central limit theorem for @xmath38 , as this would require that the increase be proportional to the mean value .    6.2 in",
    "we have looked at the @xmath0 momentum distribution as measured and published by the star experiment from pions from au+au and p+p collisions ( see @xcite and @xcite ) and fitted the hagedorn gas model coupled with tsallis distribution , as in eq .",
    "[ three ] .",
    "this can be readily compared to other full - range candidate functions , as seen in fig .",
    "[ label2]a .",
    "the best @xmath39 value obtained is from the hagedorn+tsallis model .",
    "6.2 in    this approach can be used systematically accross different centrality bins , as well as with p+p data , as shown in fig .",
    "[ label2]b .",
    "it is remarkable that the @xmath39 values are good throughout all these datasets . using data measured with a beam energy of 62.4gev",
    "also results in the hagedorn+tsallis function having the best @xmath39 values throughout all centrality bins studied .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath12 and @xmath16 parameters from these fits show that the more central collisions always exhibit a lower @xmath12-value when fitting , as well as a higher @xmath16 parameter ( fig .",
    "[ label3 ] ) .",
    "the p+p data fits well in the systematic trend . considering the dynamical model introduced in the previous section , where it was proposed that @xmath12 could be used as a measure of the correlation in the dynamics , the results shown in fig .",
    "[ label3 ] suggest that more central collisions have dynamics in which particles are less correlated .",
    "if the main source of correlation is assumed to be jet production , this could be an indication of jet quenching .",
    "the slight decrease in the @xmath16 parameter is also consistent with an increased @xmath29 value in the dynamical model .    comparing the fit parameters for the two different datasets measured with two beam energies",
    ", it can be seen that the higher beam energies exhibit a higher @xmath12-value as well as lower @xmath16 parameters .",
    "higher @xmath12 values , using the same dynamical model analogy , translate to higher @xmath29 value and a higher jet formation .",
    "6.1 in    it is noteworthy that this analysis has been done before ( @xcite ) with @xmath40 .",
    "our results can be compared to the previous as in fig .",
    "[ label4 ] , and even though the two physical processes are very different , in both cases the hagedorn gas model coupled with tsallis statistics is quite effective in describing the spectra obtained .",
    "the general trend of higher @xmath12-values and lower @xmath16-values is the same in both analyses .    6.1 in",
    "we have shown that , by using the hagedorn gas model with energies distributed according to tsallis statistics , the full - range transverse momentum spectra from heavy ion and p+p collisions can be described .",
    "it is remarkable that this approach works well for both heavy ions and p+p , and throughout the entire measured range of transverse momenta .",
    "a preliminary interpretation of the fit parameters indicates that there are less correlations in the dynamics of more central collisions , as well as a higher slope parameter @xmath16 .",
    "if we take our dynamical model and map its parameters to @xmath12 and @xmath16 , we see that this is consistent with a smaller @xmath29 value . if we interpret correlations in the dynamics as coming mainly from jets , this indicates that in more central collisions there are proportionally less jets , i.e. jet quenching .",
    "a higher energy density has also been measured before for more central auau collisions at rhic @xcite .",
    "in addition , when comparing transverse momentum data from collisions at different beam energies , we see higher @xmath12 parameters , which , when mapped to higher @xmath29 values and using the same analogy , is an indication of dynamics in which more jets are produced .",
    "further studies are warranted to fully understand the fit parameters as well as the physics that lies in the full - range transverse momentum spectra considered as such .",
    "it would also be of interest to investigate the spectra of other particle species using this same framework .",
    "other frameworks have already been used to do this @xcite , where the blast wave model is used to describe various particle spectra .    finally , it is noteworthy that the transverse momentum range considered in this work is relatively large compared to the available transverse momentum data for other particle species due to experimental limitations .",
    "our investigations show that having data all the way up to roughly @xmath41 is best for the parameters to converge ideally .",
