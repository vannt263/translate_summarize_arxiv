    "real quantum systems always interact with their environment .",
    "this interaction entails that the system , initially in a pure state , becomes entangled with the environment and decays into an incoherent mixture of several states .",
    "this phenomenon , called decoherence , is an essential feature of quantum mechanical systems .    from a fundamental point of view",
    ", decoherence provides a theoretical basis for the quantum - classical transition @xcite , emerging as a possible explanation of the quantum origin of the classical world . from a practical point of view , it is a major obstacle for building a quantum computer @xcite since it can produce the loss of the quantum character of the computer . therefore , a complete characterization of the decoherence process and its relation with the physical properties of the system and the environment , such as the strength of the system - bath interaction , characteristic times of the bath , or the presence of quantum phase transitions or quantum chaos , is needed for both fundamental and practical purposes .",
    "connections between decoherence and quantum chaos have been previously studied . however , a universal theory has not yet been found .",
    "one line of argument establishes a link between the decoherence process and the loschmidt echo @xcite , claiming that for a quantum system with a classically chaotic hamiltonian the rate at which the environment degrades information on the initial state becomes independent of the system - environment coupling strength @xcite .",
    "another point of view , in some way contrary to the former , but generally accepted , states that a chaotic bath leads to faster and stronger decoherence than an integrable one @xcite",
    ". one significative manifestation of this phenomenon is the dependence of the decoherence time , _",
    "i. e.  _ the time for which the initial correlations in the central system are lost due to decoherence , with the system - bath coupling strength @xmath0 .",
    "some authors have found that for regular baths decoherence rate is proportional to @xmath1 , while chaotic or unstable ones display a considerable weaker dependence on @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "a numerical study over a quantum walker with a complex coin has shown that , though a chaotic and a regular environments may not be distinguishable in the short - time evolution , the chaotic one continues to be effective over exponentially longer time scales , whereas the regular bath saturates much sooner @xcite . a similar study on the dicke model at weak coupling shows that the entanglement is smaller if the system is initially in a regular orbit than if it is in an irregular one @xcite .",
    "however , exceptions for this general behavior are well known @xcite .",
    "it is also argued that , when the system - bath interaction becomes extremely small , so that the perturbation theory is applicable , the regular bath leads to a faster decoherence than the chaotic one @xcite . numerical studies of many - spin system show that a chaotic bath generates stronger and faster decoherence than an integrable one for strong enough coupling .",
    "however , the result is opposite in the perturbative regime @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the connection between decoherence and quantum chaos in a many - body spin systems .",
    "we follow the methodology proposed in @xcite in order to test if the conclusions obtained there are applicable to a broader class of spin systems and , thus , can be postulated as generic .",
    "we use a hamiltonian for the bath that depends on many arbitrary , real and independent parameters , and whose dynamical regime is independent of the specific values of these parameters . the integrable limit is defined as a random realization of the xyz gaudin magnet @xcite , characterized by the existence of as many integrals of motion as quantum degrees of freedom . the transition to a chaotic regime",
    "is modelled by a single control parameter interpolating between the integrable hamiltonian and a fully chaotic one . in both limits , and along the whole transition , the complexity of the hamiltonian , understood as the number of different relevant terms , remains comparable , contrary to most of the previously studied systems , for which the regular limit is represented by a simplified hamiltonian .",
    "for example , in @xcite the integrable limit is characterized by an independent evolution of each spin of the bath , and in @xcite it is reached when the hamiltonian of the bath reduces to a site - dependent magnetic field , with a negligible interaction between different spins .    in this work ,",
    "we show that , for a wide class of spin hamiltonians , the integrable limit generates decoherence more efficiently if the system - bath coupling strength is small , while the chaotic limit becomes more efficient when the coupling is larger . we also show that this conclusion can be extended to the decoherence time .",
    "nevertheless , the transition from integrability to chaos in terms of magnitudes related to decoherence is not so smooth as it is on spectral statistics .",
    "moreover , the rate of decay of the fidelity and the linear entropy does not depend on the dynamical regime of the bath , contrary to what it is usually claimed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the model and analyze its dynamical regime by means of spectral statistics . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the efficiency of the decoherence process , illustrating the connection between the dynamical regime of the bath and some characteristic measures of decoherence , like the non - diagonal elements of the system reduced density matrix and the linear entropy . in sec . iv we study a quantitative characterization of the chaoticity of the bath in a perturbative regime using the linear entropy and the loschmidt echo .",
    "we also study the relation between the onset of chaos and the decoherence time . finally , in sec .",
    "v we summarize our results .",
    "we will consider a central system composed by two interacting spins 1/2 , * s@xmath2 * and * s@xmath3 * , and a bath composed of a large number of 1/2 spins * i@xmath4 * @xcite .",
    "the central system and the bath evolve with the following hamiltonian : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the self - hamiltonian of the system , @xmath7 the interaction between the system and the bath , and @xmath8 the hamiltonian of the bath . for @xmath6 and @xmath7",
    "we use the hamiltonians @xmath9 and @xmath10 the interaction between the central system and the bath is carried out by a single spin of the system @xmath11 ; the other spin , @xmath12 , is affected by the bath indirectly , through its interaction with @xmath11 , governed by @xmath6 .",
    "these kind of models are useful to describe , for example , the destruction of kondo effect by decoherence @xcite .    for the bath hamiltonian @xmath8 we use an xyz model with long range interactions @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are free parameters .",
    "with this generic hamiltonian we will describe a complete transition from integrability to chaos , depending on the properties of matrices @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 . the integrable limit is obtained when the hamiltonians ( [ eq : hb_general ] ) fulfilled the conditions of the xyz gaudin integrable model . in this limit the @xmath19 matrices @xmath16 , @xmath17 y @xmath18 are defined in terms set of @xmath20 arbitrary parameters @xmath21 , according to the following identities : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the jacobi elliptic function of modulus @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are related to @xmath28 by @xmath29 .",
    "the xyz gaudin model can be solved exactly by bethe ansatz @xcite . there as many independent hamiltonians ( [ eq : hb_general ] ) as quantum degrees of freedom and , with the definition ( [ xyz ] ) they commute among themselves , @xmath30 \\",
    ": \\forall i , j = 1 , \\ldots , n$ ] for arbitrary values of the parameters @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , they constitute a complete set of integrals of motion @xcite .",
    "the transition from integrability to the fully chaotic limit is performed by a single - parametric perturbation of the matrices defined above .",
    "if the amplitude of the perturbation is small , the resulting hamiltonian is close to integrability ; for increasing values of the parameter , the hamiltonian approaches the fully chaotic limit .",
    "such a perturbation can be achieved with the following identities @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are random antisymmetric matrices , and @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath36 the algebraic structure of the integrable system is lost , in a similar way as the geometric structure of a classical integrable system is broken when it is perturbed ( see @xcite for a complete discussion about this definition of quantum integrability and its connection with spectral statistics ) .",
    "note , however , that @xmath8 conserves its complexity , remaining a truly xyz model along the whole transition ; none of the x , y and z terms becomes negligible in the integrable limit . in consequence",
    ", this model allows to study the influence of the dynamical regime of the bath in decoherence process independently of its complexity .",
    "the concept of quantum chaos still lacks a clear definition .",
    "usually , a quantum system is said to be regular or chaotic depending on the statistical properties of its spectrum .",
    "using a semiclassical approximation , berry and tabor showed than the statistical properties of the spectrum of a generic quantum integrable system are well described by an uncorrelated poisson distribution @xcite . on the other hand , bohigas _ et al .",
    "_ conjectured that the statistical properties of the spectrum of a generic quantum chaotic system coincide with those of random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "therefore , the statistical properties of the spectrum of a quantum system are considered as a main signature of chaos in quantum mechanics ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .    for a general quantum system",
    ", the level density @xmath37 can be separated into a smooth part @xmath38 and a fluctuating part @xmath39 .",
    "the former depends on the specific properties of the hamiltonian , while the latter is universal depending only on the dynamical regime of the system @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to determine whether a quantum system is regular or chaotic from the statistical properties of its spectrum , it is necessary to extract the fluctuating part of the density .",
    "this is due by means of a procedure called _ unfolding _ , which maps every energy level @xmath40 to a dimensionless magnitude @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the accumulated level density @xmath44 this map can be done analytically in a few simple systems , like quantum billiards or random matrix ensembles , but in general it is a difficult task . in this paper , we have performed the unfolding by approximating @xmath45 with a set of chebyshev polynomials by means of a least - squares fit .    the most simple and widely used spectral statistic is the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution @xmath46 , _",
    "i.e. _ the probability distribution of the nearest - neighbor spacing sequence @xmath47 . for a regular quantum system",
    "the distribution follows a poisson @xmath48 , while for a quantum chaotic system it follows a wigner distribution @xmath49 .",
    "note that in both cases @xmath50 .",
    "+   +    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pds ] we show the @xmath46 distribution for a set of 50 different realizations of the regular ( @xmath51 ) and fully chaotic ( @xmath52 ) limits of bath hamiltonian @xmath8 with @xmath53 spins .",
    "the random matrices @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 are defined in terms of gaussian random variables with zero mean , and variance equal to @xmath57 each realization is obtained by choosing an independent set of @xmath15 parameters , by means of gaussian random variables with zero mean and @xmath58 . for all realizations the set of @xmath21 parameters is fixed to @xmath59 , in order to cover the whole period of the jacobi elliptic functions , and the modulus of the jacobi elliptic functions is fixed to @xmath60 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : pds ] the regular limit clearly follows the poisson distribution , while the chaotic limit is perfectly described by the wigner distribution .    in order to quantify the degree of chaoticity of the bath as function of the parameter @xmath61 it is useful to calculate the following quantity @xmath62 where @xmath63 determines the first intersection of poisson and wigner distributions",
    "this parameter transits from @xmath64 to @xmath65 when the system moves from integrability to chaos .",
    "therefore , the curve @xmath66 shows how fast or slow is this transition . in fig .",
    "[ fig : eta ] we show the value of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath61 for three different sizes of the bath , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath53 . for the three cases the system very fast approaches to chaos for small values of @xmath61 .",
    "the transition is increasingly faster for the larger bath sizes .",
    "+    the @xmath46 distribution describes short - range correlations , since it measures the fluctuations in distances between consecutive levels . to properly determine the chaoticity of a quantum system , it is also necessary to study the long - range spectral correlations",
    "there are several statistics to measure this long - range correlations .",
    "the most commonly used are @xmath70 and @xmath71 statistics @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will use instead the @xmath72 statistic , defined from the unfolded energies as @xcite @xmath73 this statistic measures the fluctuations of the unfolded energy levels @xmath74 from their average value .",
    "in particular , we are interested in its power spectrum @xmath75 which is proportional to @xmath76 for regular systems , and @xmath77 for chaotic systems @xcite .",
    "this statistic is simple to compute , and it is more sensitive to the dynamical regime of the system than the @xmath46 statistic ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of this point ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     from all these results we can conclude that the dynamical regime of the bath influences the pointers states of the central system in a non - strictly monotonic way .",
    "the modifications of the pointer states are not smooth nor monotonic when the bath change from integrability to chaos .",
    "we have also shown that the decoherence time is influenced by the dynamical regime of the bath in a very similar way : from the decay of both loschmidt echo and linear entropy , a trend from integrability to chaos can be identified in the decoherence time . however , it is also important to note that the rate of this decay is not affected by the dynamical regime of the bath , since it is roughly exponential along the whole transition .",
    "a possible explanation of this surprising feature is that the complexity of the hamiltonian remains more or less the same along the whole transition from integrability to chaos , because it always consists on a xyz model in which none of the terms is negligible .",
    "we have studied the decoherence of a two - spin central system interacting with a bath whose dynamical regime can transit from integrability to chaos . unlike previous studies the integrable regime is described by an xyz gaudin magnet with random parameters , with a complexity similar as the corresponding to the fully chaotic regime .",
    "we have calculated time evolution by numerical technics , and we have analyzed several quantities related to the reduced density matrix of the central system @xmath78 .    from our results , we conclude that at @xmath79 the reduced density matrix of the system @xmath80 has an observable dependence on the dynamical regime of the bath . for small values of the system - bath coupling strength , the asymptotic value of @xmath81 is larger in the regular limit than in the chaotic limit . however",
    ", this difference tends to decrease as the system - bath coupling strength is increased .",
    "for the diagonal elements @xmath82 and @xmath83 , the relation between the dynamical regime of the bath and the pointer states changes at @xmath84 .",
    "below this value , the regular limit gives rise to a stronger decoherence ; above it , the efficiency of the decoherence process is larger when the bath is chaotic . for both diagonal elements",
    "@xmath84 gives rise to the larger decoherence .",
    "these results show that the onset of chaos affects the decoherence process of the central system in a non simple way , since its influence depends on how strong is the coupling with the bath .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with those obtained in @xcite .",
    "the connection between the properties of the reduced density matrix of the system and the dynamical regime of the bath allows to analyze the transition form integrability to chaos in terms of decoherence .",
    "we have done so with a small value of the system - bath coupling - strength , that is , in the perturbative regime .",
    "our results show that this transition is not so smooth and monotonous as described by the spectral statistics analysis , in spite of the fact that the regular and chaotic limits are clearly distinguished .",
    "beyond this non - monotonic behavior , we have also shown that the transition from integrability to chaos in the central system reduced density matrix is slower that than the transition in the nearest neighbor spacing distribution by means of @xmath67 parameter , and it is a bit closer to the behavior of the power spectrum of @xmath72 statistic .",
    "therefore , long - range correlations in spectral fluctuations seem to be involved in the bath efficiency to produce decoherence .",
    "we have also performed a similar analysis with the decoherence time , that is , the time at which the central system losses its original correlations . for a perturbative regime ,",
    "the integrable limit produces stronger decoherence in shorter times as compared with the fully chaotic regime . nevertheless , in contradiction with the results of reference @xcite , the decay rate of the fidelity and the linear entropy does not depend on the dynamical regime of the bath .",
    "the main difference between both treatments is the modelling of the integrable regime ; while our integrable limit contains all the complexity of the chaotic regime , reference @xcite uses a simple integrable limit with large degeneracies .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the decay of the fidelity and the linear entropy is related to the complexity of the bath and not to its dynamical regime .",
