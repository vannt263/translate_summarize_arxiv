    "another candidate of such trigger is a molecular outflow , as proposed both observationally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",

    "we have initiated survey observations of this region at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths with nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) and atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ) ( see overview by @xcite ) . in this survey , @xcite identified totally fourteen molecular outflows in the @xmath3co ( @xmath4=32 ) emission , including seven new detections .",
    "comparison between the 850 @xmath14 m dust continuum emission @xcite and our @xmath3co ( @xmath4=32 ) outflow results provides two interesting candidates of the interaction between the dusty dense gas and the outflow , namely , fir-3/4 and fir 6 , both of which are cluster - forming regions . on the other hand , in the mms 7 region where there is a single intermediate - mass protostar no observational evidence for the outflow - dense gas interaction",
    "is found , and the star - formation in mms 7 is more likely to be in the isolated mode @xcite .",
    "these findings have stimulated us to conduct detailed studies of the interaction between molecular outflows and dense gas as one of the possible mechanisms of cluster formation .",

    "the total velocity range of the @xmath3co ( @xmath4=32 ) emission is much wider than that of the h@xmath42co@xmath43 ( @xmath4=10 ) emission ( 9.8 @xmath0 11.9 km s@xmath5 ; @xcite ) , suggesting that the high velocity @xmath3co ( @xmath4=32 ) emission traces the molecular outflows .",

    "these molecular outflows were also detected in the nma @xmath3co ( @xmath4=10 ) observations as shown in figure [ co32]b and [ co32]c , respectively .",
    "the nma observations show a clearer bipolar morphology of the fir 6b outflow . in particular , a narrow jet - like feature",

    "the intensity of the nma @xmath3co ( @xmath4=10 ) outflow driven by fir 6c , on the other hand , is fainter than that of the aste @xmath3co ( @xmath4=32 ) outflow , suggesting that the outflow driven by fir 6c has extended components ( @xmath44 42@xmath279 @xmath0 0.09 pc ) .",
    "moreover , we have found a new outflow candidate in the nma @xmath3co ( 10 ) observations , whose driving source is fir 6d as shown in figure [ co32](d ) . since the velocity range of this outflow component detected with the nma is within that of the ambient cloud component observed with the single - dish aste telescope ( 8.9 km s@xmath5 to 13.2 km s@xmath5 ) ,",
    "this outflow component is hidden in the ambient cloud component and undetectable with aste .",
    "the distribution of the blueshifted and redshifted @xmath3co ( @xmath4=10 ) emission around fir 6d has a clear bipolar morphology , and the velocity range of the @xmath3co ( @xmath4=10 ) emission ( 7.7 @xmath0 12.6 km s@xmath5 ) is larger than that of the h@xmath42co@xmath43 emission ( 9.8 @xmath0 11.9 km s@xmath5 , @xcite ) .",

    "the method of the multifield imaging is same as that for figure [ dust ] in the total integrated intensity map of figure [ sio]e , a well collimated , linearly extended structure with a position angle of 20@xmath22 is seen in the sio emission .",
    "the south - western tip of this sio feature coincides with the position of fir 6c . in the low velocity range shown in figure",
    "[ sio]d two sio components can be identified ; one is the compact sio component located close to fir 6c ( component 1 ) , and the other extending along the north - east to south - west direction located close to fir 6a and fir 6b ( component 2 ) . in the higher blueshifted velocity range ,",
    "component 1 appears to shift its peak position away from fir 6c progressively , and the highest velocity peak locates close to fir 6a ( see figure [ sio]a ) . on the other hand , there is no such velocity gradient seen in component 2 .",
    "we will discuss the origin of these sio components in section 4.1 .",
    "in figure [ all ] , we compare the spatial distribution of the high - velocity @xmath3co ( @xmath4=32 ) emission , sio ( @xmath16=0 , @xmath4=21 ) emission , and the 3.3 mm dust continuum emission .",
    "the linearly extended feature in the sio emission coincides well with the blueshifted lobe of the molecular outflow driven by fir 6c .",
    "since the sio emission often traces shocked molecular gas caused by the interaction between the primary jet and the ambient molecular gas @xcite , this sio emission probably traces the well collimated outflow driven by fir 6c .",
    "furthermore , core 2 , 3 , and 4 in fir 6a clump surround the tip of component 1 in the sio emission , while the tip of component 2 locates even more downstream beyond fir 6a clump . in figure [ pv ] , we show position - velocity diagrams of the @xmath3co ( @xmath4=32 ) and sio ( @xmath16=0 , @xmath4=21 ) lines along the axis of the fir 6c outflow .",
    "it is obvious that there are two distinct outflow components in the @xmath3co and sio emission ; the velocity component with the higher blueshifted velocity corresponds to component 1 , while the other lower velocity component located away from fir 6c corresponds to component 2 .",
    "the sio emission of component 1 shows significant increase of the line width at the position of fir 6a clump .",
    "this increase of the sio line width , as well as the shell - like structure in fir 6a clump at the interface with component 1 , implies the presence of the interaction between the molecular outflow driven by fir 6c and fir 6a clump @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the two distinct sio components were ejected toward slightly different 3-dimensional directions , as seen in other protostellar jets @xcite , and that the direction of component 1 matches the direction to fir 6a clump from fir 6c .",
    "therefore , the jet component 1 interacts with fir 6a clump while component 2 keeps moving freely . on the assumption of the same jet propagation velocity",
    ", the lower line of sight velocity of component 2 implies that the jet axis of component 2 is    closer    to the plane of the sky than that of component 1 , which is consistent with the larger distance of component 2 from fir 6c .",
    "such an interaction associated with the outflow alters the physical condition of the surrounding medium through the c - type shock @xcite . @xcite",
    "have reported that a postshock density is 10 - 40 times more than a preshock density from their mhd simulation of the interaction . since the present gas density of fir 6a clump",
    "is estimated to be @xmath0 1.0 - 2.9 @xmath6 10@xmath11 @xmath12 , the preshock density of fir 6a clump is @xmath0 2.6 - 7.3 @xmath6 10@xmath45 @xmath12 on the assumption that a postshock density is 40 times more than a preshock density .",
    "the redshifted counterpart of the sio emission , on the other hand , was not detected .",
    "one of the possible reasons for the non - detection of the sio emission is that there is not sufficient dense - gas material at the south - west of fir 6c , and hence the reservoir of the sio production or amount of dust grains @xcite are not ample enough .",
    "in fact , the 1.3 mm dust continuum map in the fir 6 region by @xcite exhibits that there is asymmetric distribution of dusts around fir 6c , and that at the south - west of fir 6c the dust continuum emission becomes fainter while toward the north - east of fir 6c the dust continuum emission becomes stronger and shows a emission ridge .      in section 4.1 .",
    ", we demonstrate that the outflow driven by fir 6c interacts with fir 6a clump .",
    "three cores in fir 6a clump locate around the tip of the fir 6c outflow , and it is possible that the interaction affects the physical evolution of these cores . in the following section ,",
    "we discuss the possible effects of the interaction on these cores .",
    "first , we compare the time scale of the interaction to the time scale of fragmentation of fir 6a clump to produce the three cores . on the assumption that the interaction time scale @xmath46 is similar to the dynamical time - scale of the fir 6c outflow , i.e. @xmath46 @xmath0 @xmath47 ,",
    "@xmath46 is estimated to be 1.2 - 1.9 @xmath6 10@xmath48 yr @xcite .",
    "the time scale of the fragmentation into the cores can be estimated on the assumption that the fragmentation time scale is the sound crossing time ; @xmath49 @xmath0 1.5 @xmath6 10@xmath50 yr .",
    "these two times scales are indistinguishable from each other and hence it is not straightforward to tell whether the interaction takes place before or after the production of the three cores . then we will discuss the following two cases ;    * case 1 : the fir 6a cores were formed before the interaction occurs . *",
    "case 2 : the fir 6a cores were formed after the interaction occurs .    in case 1 , the fir 6a cores could have been formed via spontaneous fragmentation or turbument fragmentation before the interaction @xcite . in this case , the outflow driven by fir 6c may externally affect the subsequent evolution of these cores .",
    "@xcite have compared the total force required to balance the gravity of the dense cores with the outflow momentum flux in the ngc 2264-c region , in order to assess whether the outflows influence the evolution of the neighboring cores .",
    "we follow the same argument for our case of the fir 6 region to investigate whether the blueshifted component of the fir 6c outflow influences the physical evolution of the fir 6a cores .",
    "the total force needed to balance gravity @xmath51 is expressed as @xmath52 ( eq.10 ; @xcite ) . since the average radius of the fir 6a cores and the mass are estimated to be @xmath53 = 0.0075 pc and @xmath54 = 1.3 -3.6 m@xmath2 , respectively ( see section 3.1 . ) , @xmath51 is calculated to be 1.0 - 7.7 @xmath6 10@xmath7 m@xmath2 km s@xmath5 yr@xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the outflow momentum flux of the blueshifted component of the fir 6c outflow @xmath55 is 2.4 @xmath6 10@xmath9 m@xmath2 km s@xmath5 yr@xmath5 @xcite , and hence the total force is @xmath0 10 times larger than the outflow momentum flux ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "therefore , it is unlikely that the interaction with the fir 6c outflow influences the subsequent physical evolution of the fir 6a cores . @xcite",
    "have also reported that the total momentum flux of eleven outflows in ngc 2264-c is insufficient to prevent the cores from collapsing .    in case 2 ,",
    "the fir 6a cores are considered to have been produced by the interaction .",
    "in fact , @xcite have demonstrated that the external shock compression could trigger the gravitational fragmentation of dense - gas clumps into cores .",
    "then , we compare the separation among core 2 , 3 , and 4 with the jeans length in order to investigate whether the fragmentation into the cores is caused by the gravitational instability .",
    "the mean projected separation ( @xmath25 @xmath57 ) among the fir 6a cores , corresponding to the lower limit of the real separation , is @xmath0 5 @xmath1 ( @xmath0 2.0 @xmath6 10@xmath10 au ) .",
    "the jeans length ( @xmath25 @xmath58 ) can be calculated with @xmath59 @xcite , where @xmath60 , g , and @xmath38 are the effective sound speed , gravitational constant , and the average gas density of fir 6a clump , respectively .",
    "we adopt a preshock density of @xmath0 2.6 - 7.3 @xmath6 10@xmath45 @xmath12 as an average gas density @xmath38 of fir 6a clump before the interaction .",
    "it is difficult , on the other hand , to observationally estimate @xmath60 , since there is no molecular emission , such as h@xmath42co@xmath43 ( @xmath4=10 ) and n@xmath61h@xmath43 ( @xmath4=10 ) , associated with fir 6a clump @xcite .",
    "hence , we simply assume that @xmath60 in fir 6a clump is same as that in fir 4 clump ( @xmath0 0.62 km s@xmath5 ) . with these values ,",
    "the jeans length @xmath62 is estimated to be 5.0 - 8.4 @xmath63 au , which is comparable to the means separation among fir 6a cores .",
    "then , it is possible that the interaction triggers the jeans instability in fir 6a clump , which results in the fragmentation into fir 6a cores .",
    "furthermore , this interpretation is supported by the distribution of the dusty cores , which appears to delineate the outflow structure .",

    "the interaction with the fir 6c outflow is unlikely to affect the subsequent evolution of the fir 6a cores , since the momemtum flux of the fir 6c outflow is one order of magnitude smaller than the gravitational force in the fir 6a cores . in the latter case",

    "<S> we have conducted millimeter interferometric observations of the orion molecular cloud-2 ( omc-2 ) fir 6 region at an angular resolution of @xmath0 4@xmath1 - 7@xmath1 with the nobeyama millimeter array ( nma ) . in the 3.3 mm continuum emission we detected dusty core counterparts of the previously identified fir sources ( fir 6a , 6b , 6c , and 6d ) , and moreover , resolved fir 6a into three dusty cores . </S>",
    "<S> the size and mass of these cores are estimated to be 1100 - 5900 au and 0.19 - 5.5 m@xmath2 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we found that in the @xmath3co ( @xmath4=10 ) emission fir 6b , 6c , and 6d eject the molecular outflow and that the fir 6c outflow also exhibits at least two collimated jet - like components in the sio ( @xmath4=21 ) emission . at the tip of one of the sio components there </S>",
    "<S> appears abrupt increase of the sio line width ( @xmath0 15 km s@xmath5 ) , where the three resolved cores in fir 6a seem to delineate the tip . </S>",
    "<S> these results imply the presence of the interaction and the bowshock front between the fir 6c molecular outflow and fir 6a .    </S>",
    "<S> if the interaction occurred after the formation of the fir 6a cores the influence of the fir 6c outflow on the fir 6a cores is minimal , since the total gravitational force in the fir 6a cores ( 1.0 - 7.7 @xmath6 10@xmath7 m@xmath2 km s@xmath8 yr@xmath5 ) is much larger than the outflow momentum flux ( 2.4 @xmath6 10@xmath9 m@xmath2 km s@xmath8 yr@xmath5 ) . on the other hand , it is also possible that the interaction caused the gravitational instability in fir 6a , and triggered the fragmentation into three cores , since the separation among these cores ( @xmath0 2.0 @xmath6 10@xmath10au ) is on the same order of the jeans length ( @xmath0 5.0 - 8.4 @xmath6 10@xmath10au ) . in either case , </S>",
