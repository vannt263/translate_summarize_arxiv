    "wireless systems are becoming increasingly interference limited rather than noise limited , attributed to the fact that the cells are decreasing in size and the number of users within a cell is increasing . mitigating the impact of interference between transmit - receive pairs is of great importance in order to achieve higher data rates . describing the complete capacity region of the interference channel remains an open problem in information theory  @xcite .",
    "for very strong interference , successive cancellation schemes have to be applied , while in the weak interference regime , treating the interference as additive noise is optimal to within one bit  @xcite . treating the interference as noise ,",
    "the @xmath0user achievable rates region has been found in @xcite to be the convex hull of @xmath2 hyper - surfaces .",
    "the rates region bounded by these hyper - surfaces is not necessarily convex , and hence a convex hull operation is imposed through the strategy of time - sharing .",

    ", this consequently leads to @xmath1 corner points within the rates region . and",
    "by forming a convex hull through time - sharing between those corner points , it thereby leads to what we denote a crystallized rates region .",
    "utility maximization using game - theoretic techniques has recently received significant attention @xcite .",
    "most of the existing game theoretic works are based on the concept of nash equilibrium @xcite . however , the nash equilibrium investigates the individual payoff and might not be system efficient , i.e. the performance of the game outcome could still be improved . in 2005 ,",
    "nobel prize was awarded to robert j. aumann for his contribution of proposing the concept of correlated equilibrium @xcite . unlike nash equilibrium",
    "in which each user only considers its own strategy , correlated equilibrium achieves better performance by allowing each user to consider the joint distribution of the users actions . in other words ,",
    "each user needs to consider the others behaviors to see if there are mutual benefits to explore @xcite . likewise , mechanism design ( including auction theory @xcite ) is a subfield of game theory that studies how to design the game rule in order to achieve good overall system performance @xcite .",
    "mechanism design has drawn recently a great attention in the research community , especially after another nobel prize in 2007 .",
    "the paper presents three contributions with the following structure :    1 .",
    "section [ sec : crystallized ] introduces the concept of crystallized rates region with on / off power control .",
    "2 .   section [ sec : ce ] applies the game theoretic concept of correlated equilibrium ( ce ) to the rates region problem .",
    "the ce exhibits the property of forming a convex set around the @xmath1 corner points , hence fitting suitably in the crystallized rates region formulation .",
    "3 .   using mechanism design , section [ sec : mechanismdesign ] presents an example in applying these two concepts for the @xmath5user channel and formulates the vickrey - clarke - groves auction utility . to find the solution point distributively ,",
    "the regret matching learning algorithm is employed by virtue of its property of converging to the correlated equilibrium set .",
    "section [ sec : simulation ] demonstrates the ideas through simulation , and section [ sec : conclusion ] draws the conclusions .",
    "a @xmath5user interference channel is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:2userssys ] .",
    "user @xmath6 transmits its signal @xmath7 to the receiver @xmath8 .",
    "the receiver front end has additive thermal noise @xmath9 of variance @xmath10 .",
    "there is no cooperation at the transmit , nor at the receive side .",
    "the channel is flat fading . for brevity @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 represent the channel power gain _",
    "normalized _ by the noise variance .",
    "explicitly , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the channel gain from the @xmath20 transmitter to the @xmath21 receiver .",
    "user @xmath6 transmits with power @xmath22 , and it has a maximum power constraint of @xmath4 .    user interference channel ]    in an effort to keep the complexity of the receivers fairly simple , the interference is treated as noise .",
    "such case is encountered in sensor networks and in cellular communication where it is desired to have low power - consuming and correspondingly low complexity receivers .",
    "therefore , with the power vector @xmath23^t$ ] , treating the interference as noise the achievable rates for the @xmath5user interference channel are : @xmath24      in @xcite the achievable rates region for the general @xmath0user channel , treating the interference as noise , is found to be the convex hull of the union of @xmath2 hyper - surfaces .",
    "each hyper - surface is characterized by holding one of the transmitter constant at a full power while the other transmitters sweep all their power range , hence forming a hyper - surface as a result .",
    "there are @xmath2 transmitters , resulting in @xmath2 hyper - surfaces , onto which the convex hull operation is performed .",
    "the convexity or concavity behavior of these hyper - surface frontiers is complex . a rates region set is convex whenever it entirely encloses a straight line formed by connecting any two points within the rates region .",
    "as a result when the rates _ region _ is _ convex _ , its outerbound hyper - surface _ frontiers _ are _ concave _ , and vice versa .    for the @xmath5user channel ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ fig:2drateregion ] , the hyper - surfaces are the two frontiers : @xmath25 , characterized by holding @xmath26 and @xmath27 sweeps all its power range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , and @xmath28 characterized by holding @xmath29 and @xmath30 sweeps all its power range from @xmath3 to @xmath4 . these frontiers are referred to as _ potential lines _ given that each is characterized by holding one the transmit power arguments at a constant value , in this case @xmath4 , while the other power argument spans the whole power range .",
    "these potential lines are concave in noise - limited regimes ( thus enclosing a convex rates region ) as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2drateregion]-a , and they shift towards convexity as the interference increases , as in fig .",
    "[ fig:2drateregion]-d . in cases with moderate interference levels , they can exhibit non - stationary inflection point , as at point d in fig.[fig:2drateregion]-b .      the crystallized rates region approach approximates the achievable rates region formed by the potential lines @xmath31 and @xmath32 into the convex time - sharing hull of the straight lines connecting points a , b , and c. denoting @xmath33 the point in the rates region achieved when user @xmath34 transmits at @xmath27 and user @xmath35 transmits at @xmath30 in eq .",
    "( [ ratesequations ] ) : point a is @xmath36 where only user 2 transmits at full power and user 1 is silent , point b is @xmath37 where both users transmit simultaneously at full power , and point c is @xmath38 where user 1 transmits at full power and user 2 is silent .",
    "hence , we refer by binary power control such mechanism of operation in producing points a , b , and c. we denote such points that are formed by binary power control as the _ corner _ points of the rates region .",
    "in the @xmath5user interference channel , there exist @xmath39 corner points , similarly in the @xmath0user case there exist @xmath1 corner points .",
    "therefore , this paper simplifies the analysis of the rates region in the @xmath0dimensional space to just focus on finding the convex time - sharing hull onto the @xmath1 corner points , forming the crystallized rates region . in the @xmath5user dimension , these are straight time - sharing lines connecting two points ; in the @xmath40user dimension , these are a set of polygon surfaces each connecting three points , see fig . [ fig:3users ] .                instead of a power control problem in finding @xmath22 , the problem becomes finding the appropriate time - sharing coefficients of the @xmath1 corner points .",
    "for the @xmath5user case , let @xmath41@xmath42^t$ ] , @xmath43 , denote the _ system _ time - sharing coefficients vector of the respective corner points @xmath38 ( user 1 transmitting only with a time - sharing coefficient @xmath44 ) , @xmath36 ( user 2 transmitting only with a time - sharing coefficient @xmath45 ) , and @xmath46 ( both users transmitting with a time - sharing coefficient @xmath47 ) .",
    "the reason @xmath41 is labeled a _ system _ time - sharing coefficients vector is to emphasize the combinatorial element in constructing the corner points , where the cardinality of @xmath48@xmath41@xmath49 .    then for @xmath5user case , in contrast with eq .",
    "( [ ratesequations ] ) , the new crystallized rates equations for @xmath50 and @xmath51 are : @xmath52    any solution point on the crystallized frontier would lie somewhere on the time - sharing line connecting two points for the @xmath5user case ; and similarly for the @xmath40user case , the solution point lies somewhere on a time - sharing plane connecting three points , then by deduction we obtain the following corollary :    [ cor : max_n_nonzero ] the system time - sharing vector @xmath41 , for any solution point on the @xmath0user crystallized rates region , has at maximum @xmath2 nonzero coefficients out of its @xmath1 elements .      examining the crystallized rates region in more details for the @xmath5user interference channel , we evaluate the area of the rates region bounded by the potential lines @xmath31 and @xmath32 achieved through power control , and the area of the rates region formed by time - sharing points a , b , and c. in effect , we are evaluating how much gain or loss results from completely replacing the traditional power control scheme ( see eq .",
    "( [ ratesequations ] ) ) with the time - sharing scheme between the corner points ( see eq .",
    "( [ crystallizedrates ] ) ) .",
    "for this purpose we consider the symmetric channel , where @xmath53 , and we increase the interference @xmath12 to vary the signal to interference ratio @xmath54 from @xmath55db to @xmath56db .",
    "the value of the area bounded by the power control potential lines is plotted in fig.[fig : rrareas ] together with the value of the area bounded by the time - sharing scheme through the point b ( formed by the time - sharing lines a - b and b - c ) .",
    "in addition , for reference , the area confined by the time - sharing line a - c is plotted , which does not depend on the sir .    for weak interference , or equivalently noise - limited regime , point b",
    "is used in constructing the crystallized region .",
    "as the interference increases beyond a certain threshold level , time - sharing through point b becomes suboptimal , and time - sharing a - c becomes optimal .",
    "the exact switching point from power control to time - sharing has been found in @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rrareas ] , this happens at the intersection of the blue line ( with circle markers ) and the a - c dotted line .",
    "as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rrareas ] , there is no significant loss in the rates region area if time - sharing is used universally instead of traditional power control , in fact in some cases time - sharing offers considerable gain .",
    "specifically , whenever the potential lines exhibit concavity , time - sharing loses to power control ; whenever the potential lines exhibit convexity , time - sharing gains over power control .",
    "different values of @xmath11 also lead to the same conclusion .        in fig .",
    "[ fig : rrareasperct ] the percentage of the rates region gain ( or loss ) in using the time - sharing scheme ( through point b ) over the power control scheme is plotted for the same symmetric channel examined in fig .",
    "[ fig : rrareas ]",
    ". the loss does not exceed @xmath57 , and the time - sharing strategy is therefore quite attractive . for illustration purposes , note that the x - axis in fig .",
    "[ fig : rrareasperct ] was chosen to span the interference range of @xmath56db to @xmath3db ; whereas in fig .  [ fig : rrareas ] the x - axis interference range was from @xmath56db to @xmath55db .",
    "if we were to plot the x - axis in fig .  [ fig : rrareasperct ] up to @xmath55db instead of the @xmath3db , the percentage gain would have reached on the y - axis up to @xmath58 .",
    "note that for high interference time - sharing through point b is suboptimal and time - sharing a - c is optimal , so the gain over power control is even larger .",
    "the crystallized rates region offers a good alternative to form the rates region of the @xmath0user interference channel with marginal loss , and sometimes significant gain ( especially for interference - limited regimes ) .",
    "therefore the problem revolves around finding the convex hull over the set of polygons connecting the @xmath1 corner points .",
    "one technique explored to achieve the convex hull is through the concept of correlated equilibrium in game theory .",
    "every user @xmath6 has a transmit strategy @xmath59 of either @xmath3 or @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath60 is the utility of user @xmath6 .",
    "nash equilibrium is a well - known concept to analyze the outcome of a game which states that in the equilibrium every user will select a utility - maximizing strategy given the strategies of every other user .",
    "nash equilibrium achieving strategy @xmath61 of user @xmath6 is defined as : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is any possible strategy of user @xmath6 , @xmath64 is the strategy vector of all other users except user @xmath6 , and @xmath65 is the strategy space @xmath66 . in other words , given the other users actions , no user can increase its utility alone by changing its own action .",
    "next the concept of the correlated equilibrium is studied .",
    "it is more general than the nash equilibrium and it was first proposed in @xcite .",
    "the idea is that a strategy profile is chosen according to the joint distribution instead of the marginal distribution of users strategies .",
    "when converging to the recommended strategy , it is to the users best interests to conform to this strategy .",
    "the distribution is called the correlated equilibrium , which is defined as :    a probability distribution @xmath67 is a correlated equilibrium of a game , if and only if , for all @xmath6 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , @xmath70\\geq0 , \\forall \\alpha_i\\in \\omega_i.\\ ] ]    @xmath71 denotes the strategy space of all the users other than user @xmath6 . as every user @xmath72 , @xmath73 , has a possible @xmath3 or @xmath4 strategy choice",
    ", then the cardinality of @xmath71 is @xmath74 .",
    "therefore the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : ce1 ] ) have @xmath75 summation terms .",
    "the summation over @xmath76 generates the marginal expectation .",
    "the inequality ( [ eqn : ce1 ] ) means that when the recommendation to user @xmath6 is to choose action @xmath77 , then choosing action @xmath63 instead of @xmath77 can not result in a higher expected payoff to user @xmath6 .",
    "it is worth to point out that the probability distribution @xmath67 is a joint point mass function ( pmf ) of the different combinations of the @xmath2 users strategies .",
    "therefore , @xmath67 is the joint pmf of the resulting @xmath78 _ system _ strategy points .",
    "discounting the trivial system strategy of all the users transmitting at @xmath3 , there exist @xmath1 system strategy points that we wish to find their pmfs .",
    "revisiting subsection [ subsec : thetas ] , the @xmath1 point mass functions that we want to find are the system time - sharing coefficients @xmath79 , @xmath80 .",
    "we can index those @xmath1 pmfs to the corresponding @xmath79 in any bijective one - to - one mapping .",
    "index @xmath81 can denote the base-@xmath35 representation of the binary users strategies ( starting with user @xmath34 s binary action as the least significant bit ) .",
    "for example , let @xmath82 denotes that user @xmath6 transmits with @xmath83 , and @xmath84 denotes that user @xmath6 is silent with @xmath85 . in subsection",
    "[ subsec : thetas ] , @xmath44 was mapped to user @xmath34 transmitting , equivalently @xmath86 ; where we defined explicitly @xmath87 as the point mass function of the point @xmath88 . and similarly @xmath47 was mapped to both users transmitting , @xmath89 .",
    "morever , by definition , @xmath90 , and as discussed in corollary i , the solution point possesses at most @xmath2 nonzero pmfs in the joint distribution @xmath67 .",
    "the correlated equilibriums set is nonempty , closed and convex in every finite game @xcite .",
    "in fact , every nash equilibrium and mixed ( i.e. time - sharing ) strategy of nash equilibriums are within the correlated equilibrium set , and the nash equilibrium correspond to the special case where @xmath91 is a product of each individual user s probability for different actions , i.e. , the play of the different users is independent @xcite .",
    "there are two major challenges to implement correlated equilibrium for rate optimization over the interference channel . first , to ensure the system converges to the desired point ( such as time - sharing between a - c instead of going through point b in fig .",
    "[ fig:2drateregion ] ( d ) ) . as an example",
    ", we considered an auction utility function from mechanism design .",
    "second , to achieve the equilibrium , a distributive solution is desirable , where we propose the self - learning regret matching algorithm .",
    "one important mechanism design is the vickrey - clarke - groves ( vcg ) auction @xcite which imposes cost to resolve the conflicts between users .",
    "using the basic idea of vcg , where we want to maximize @xmath92 , the user utility @xmath60 is designed to be the rate @xmath93 minus a payment cost function @xmath94 as @xmath95 the payment cost of user @xmath6 is expressed as the performance loss of all other users due to the inclusion of user @xmath6 , explicitly : @xmath96hence if @xmath59 is @xmath3 for user @xmath6 , it is equivalent to user @xmath6 being absent , consequently the cost @xmath97 whenever @xmath85 . for the @xmath5user case , focusing on @xmath98 when @xmath99 , hence : a ) if @xmath100 , then @xmath101 and @xmath102 ; b ) if @xmath103 , then : @xmath104@xmath105 follows by symmetry . as a result , the vcg utilities for the @xmath5user channel are summarized in table [ table : modified chick ] , where @xmath106    notice that each user pays the cost because of its involvement",
    "this cost function can be calculated and exchanged before transmission with little signalling overhead .",
    "finally , we exhibit the regret - matching algorithm @xcite to learn in a distributive fashion how to achieve the correlated equilibrium set in solving the vcg auction .",
    "the algorithm is named regret - matching ( no - regret ) algorithm , because the stationary solution of the learning algorithm exhibits no regret and the probability to take an action is proportional to the `` regrets '' for not having played the other actions .",
    "specifically , for user @xmath6 there are two distinct binary actions @xmath84 and @xmath82 at every time @xmath107 ( where @xmath108 , and @xmath109 ) .",
    "the regret @xmath110 of user @xmath6 at time @xmath111 for playing action @xmath82 instead of the other action @xmath112 is @xmath113 where @xmath114.\\vspace{-1mm}\\ ] ] here @xmath115 is the utility at time @xmath116 and @xmath76 is other users actions .",
    "@xmath117 has the interpretation of average payoff that user @xmath6 would have obtained if it had played action @xmath84 every time in the past instead of choosing @xmath82 .",
    "the expression @xmath118 can be viewed as a measure of the average regret .",
    "similarly , @xmath119 represents the average regret if the alternative action has been taken .    recalling the discussion in subsection [ subsec : ceincrys ] about the mapping notation we adopted between the point mass functions @xmath120 and the system time - sharing coefficients ( @xmath41s )",
    ", then we want to find the point mass function @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "as discussed in subsection [ subsec : thetas ] there exist @xmath124 pmfs for the @xmath5user case . for the trivial case of the origin point @xmath125 , @xmath126 .",
    "we are left to obtain @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 . specifically to the @xmath5user case , this simplifies further to finding only _ two _ variables .",
    "denoting @xmath130 , and @xmath131 , then @xmath47 can be deduced as @xmath132 .",
    "the details of the regret - matching algorithm is shown in table [ table : regretmatching ] .",
    "the probability @xmath133 is a linear function of the regret , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : regret_finding_p ] ) .",
    "the algorithm has a complexity of @xmath134 .    by using the theorem in @xcite ,",
    "if every user plays according to the learning algorithm in table [ table : regretmatching ] , the adaptive learning algorithm has the property that the probability distribution found converges on the set of correlated equilibrium .",
    "it has been shown that the set of correlated equilibrium is nonempty , closed and convex @xcite .",
    "therefore , by using the algorithm in table [ table : regretmatching ] , we can guarantee that the algorithm converges to the set of ce as @xmath135 .",
