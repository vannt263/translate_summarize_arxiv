    "<S> we develop a symmetry classification scheme to find ground states of pseudo spin-1/2 , spin-1 , and spin-2 spin - orbit coupled spinor bose - einstein condensates , and show that as the so(2 ) symmetry of simultaneous spin and space rotations is broken into discrete cyclic groups , various types of lattice structures emerge in the absence of a lattice potential , examples include two different kagaome lattices for pseudo spin-1/2 condensates and a nematic vortex lattice in which uniaxial and biaxial spin textures align alternatively for spin-2 condensates . for the pseudo spin-1/2 system , although mean - field states always break time - reversal symmetry , there exists a time - reversal invariant many - body ground state , which is fragmented and expected to be observed in a micro - condensate . </S>"
