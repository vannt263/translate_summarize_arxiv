    "smith - purcell radiation ( spr ) arriving while a charged particle moves in the vicinity of the periodically deformed surface is widely used or planned to be used both for new free electron laser ( fel ) schemes  @xcite including new terahertz sources  @xcite and for beam diagnostics  @xcite . in these cases the metal gratings of the different shapes are used as radiators . for all metal gratings",
    "the spr have a convenient feature that is so - called smith - purcell dispersion relation  @xcite : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the radiation wavelength , @xmath2 is the grating period , @xmath3 is the diffraction order , @xmath4 is the particle velocity in the speed of light units , @xmath5 is the radiation polar angle .",
    "this relation was proven experimentally many times . in the case of coherent spr from lamellar gratings",
    "the relation was demonstrated by shibata et al . in  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we still have a lack of knowledge about the properties of spr from the dielectric gratings .",
    "the first theoretical investigations were made by lampel in  @xcite but we believe that the method used in cited paper is an ambiguous one .",
    "experimental investigations were made in the papers  @xcite where authors examined the millimeter wavelength radiation from 2d and 1d photonic crystals used as spr targets .",
    "the 1d photonic crystal is just a periodical structure , consisting of a number of teflon ( ptfe ) cylinders  @xcite .",
    "such structure is very similar to well - known grating and one may consider the radiation from it as spr from the dielectric grating",
    ". nevertheless , in the photonic crystals cherenkov radiation ( cr ) plays an important role  @xcite .",
    "the standard procedure to make theoretical studies of the radiation from the photonic crystal is to assume that the crystal is infinite ( a number of periods tends to infinity ) and not absorbing one  @xcite . that automatically gives us no chance to compare radiation characteristics from dielectric and metal gratings using the same formalism . in the millimeter wavelength region the grating have just some tens of periods and the infinite assumption is not a good one .",
    "hence , we need a model to simulate the characteristics of all kinds of radiation generated by the electron beam moving near the grating . such model may be useful for updating of the radiation schemes for practical application .",
    "in this paper we present the results of theoretical and experimental studies of the coherent spr from the lamellar dielectric grating ( or 1d photonic crystal ) generated by the bunched electron beam with 6.1mev energy in the millimeter wavelength region .",
    "up to our knowledge that is only the second experimental investigation of such radiation , the first one was performed by horiuchi et al . in  @xcite .",
    "the main our goal is to develop a physically clear model suitable for a case of simultaneous generation of coherent spr and cr in periodic structure with an arbitrary permittivity that makes it possible to compare the radiation characteristics from the dielectric and metal gratings . in our experimental part we compare the characteristics of radiation from the aluminium and teflon lamellar gratings .",
    "in our theoretical estimations we will follow the recent papers of karlovets and potylitsyn  @xcite where authors have shown a simple and elegant method of the maxwell s equations solution that makes it possible to simulate the characteristics of any type of polarization radiation ( including transition radiation , diffraction radiation , cr , spr ) appearing simultaneously .",
    "the term `` polarization radiation '' clearly shows a nature of the radiation that is a polarization of a target ( grating ) material by electromagnetic field of the traveling charged particle . in the cited articles",
    "@xcite it was shown that the method developed gives well known results for transition radiation , diffraction one , cr and spr that are just different `` kinematic '' cases of the polarization radiation .",
    "[ teor_scheme ] shows the geometry of the problem and some designations .",
    "the electron bunch moves along @xmath6 axis with velocity @xmath7 and impact - parameter @xmath8 .",

    "is assumed to be infinite .",
    "the detector is situated in the wave- ( far - field ) zone and its position is determined by a polar angle @xmath5 and an azimuth angle @xmath14 .",
    "such unusual grating orientation was chosen because we need to satisfy a condition that the radiation wavelength is less than the size of a surface of the grating through which we refract the radiation in order to use simlpe fresnel coefficients ( see further ) . in cited paper  @xcite",
    "this condition was satisfied in another way , it was assumed that @xmath15 .        according to the used method a magnetic field of the polarization radiation @xmath16 in a general case",
    "may be written as  @xcite : @xmath17 it should be mentioned that this formula is the exact solution of the maxwell equation with the only assumption that the media is not magnetic one . here @xmath18 is the speed of light ; @xmath19 is the polarization current density , @xmath20 is the grating conductivity ; @xmath21 is the fourier transform of electron coulomb field ; @xmath22 is the green function where @xmath23 is the coordinate of the radiation point and @xmath24 is the coordinate of the detection point . the integration is performed over the whole grating volume @xmath25 .    in our case",

    "physically such expansion means that we replace our radiating region inside the grating by a single effective dipole situated at the coordinate origin .",

    "it is not really correct to speculate about forward directed radiation because during our theoretical simulations we do not take into account the one from the faces of the grating .",
    "[ fig3a ] ,  [ fig3b ] show the spectral - angular distributions of the radiation from both gratings .",

    "incoherent radiation may not be measured by the detector .",
    "the measured radiation yield was averaged over 20 trains .",
    "the statistical error was less than 10% during the experiments .",

    "[ teor_scheme ] is not useful for the aluminium grating that is why it was set up in the `` standard '' position with grooves directed toward the detector .",
    "however , for the teflon grating both orientations are possible and they both were used during the experiment .",
    "let us denote : g1 is the orientation of the teflon grating with the substrate directed toward the detector ( just like in fig .",
    "[ teor_scheme ] ) and g2 is the orientation of the teflon grating with the grooves directed toward the detector ( opposite case ) .    as the first step we measured the polar distribution of the coherent spr for both gratings for all possible geometries .",

    "[ fig5 ] by the red dots for aluminium grating , by the green diamonds for the teflon grating in g1 orientation and by the blue stars for the teflon grating in g2 orientation .",

    "blue line shows a `` control level '' that was chosen in order to take into account only the stronger effects .",
    "first one may see that almost all radiation from the aluminium grating is situated in the area of large polar angles and falls drastically while polar angle @xmath5 is larger than @xmath103deg .",
    "we believe that this fact that do not coincide with our theoretical estimations is caused by the finite transverse size of the grating .",
    "indeed , the transverse radius of the lorentz - boosted electron field is about @xmath37 and for @xmath104 mm ( taken from smith - purcell relation for @xmath105deg ) it is about @xmath106 mm , while the grating size is just @xmath100 mm .",
    "that seems to be a reason for significant attenuation of larger wavelengths .",
    "the radiation at polar angles less than @xmath107deg is very weak .",
    "let us analyze the spr from the teflon grating .",
    "first of all one may see that the radiation is not monotonic one but have clear peak structure .",
    "we can see one good peak for g2 that is situated near @xmath108deg . for g1",
    "we may see the same peak near @xmath108deg but it is not so intensive and we can see one additional peak near @xmath109deg .",
    "the peak structure looks very strange but it was also shown in the previously cited paper  @xcite , where it was explained using the terms of photonic crystal band - gaps . in our theoretical estimations we assumed single refraction through one plane , but there seems to be an additional contribution to the radiation yield from the planes that were not taken into account ( faces , grooves ) .",
    "it seems that this problem should be solved numerically .    as the second step we measured the radiation spectra in both registered peaks .",
    "the low - pass dichoric filters were used for this procedure  @xcite .",
    "the filters were set up in order before the detector instead of beyond - cutoff waveguide . in this case",
    "the angular acceptance of the detector is rather large ( about @xmath110deg ) that plays a role in the detected spectra .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the spectrum of the coherent spr is shown .",
    "the spectrum was measured from the teflon grating with the orientation g2 in the peak near @xmath111deg . from fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] one may see that the measured spectrum have two lines : in a region from @xmath112 to @xmath113 mm and from @xmath114 to @xmath115 mm . according to the smith - purcell dispersion relation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) ) we should have here the wavelength @xmath116 mm .",
    "such shift of the registered wavelength ( first of them ) is not really clear but the reason may be the large angular acceptance of the detector during the spectral measurements .",
    "the second spectral line has nothing to do with the smith - purcell relation . during our theoretical simulations ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] ) we shown that there are rather powerful additional radiation lines .",
    "it seems that the second measured spectral line comes from these additional lines .        in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] the spectrum of the coherent spr that was measured from the teflon grating with orientation g1 in the peak near @xmath117deg is shown .",

    "one may clearly see that the measured radiation have maximum in the wavelength region from @xmath119 mm to @xmath120 mm . according to the smith - purcell relation the radiation with wavelength @xmath93 mm",
    "should be generated at this polar angle .",
    "this fact is the most interesting in our investigation because this radiation wavelength is significantly lower than our coherent threshold . substituting the wavelength ( @xmath76 mm ) and our bunch length ( @xmath74 mm ) into eq .",
    "( [ form ] ) one may obtain the value of form - factor that is equal to @xmath121 . according to our theoretical simulations at this wavelength the coherent spr from the metal grating and the teflon one should have almost same intensity ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "but the radiation from the teflon grating is strong enough to be measured in a contrast to the radiation from the metal grating that was not detected ( see fig .  [ fig5 ] )",
    "this fact needs additional theoretical investigations but seems to be promising for creation of new radiation sources in sub - millimeter and terahertz regions based on coherent radiation of short electron bunches .",

    "[ fig7 ] that there is some amount of radiation in the region from @xmath112 mm to @xmath113 mm .",

    "in this paper we have presented the simple model for estimation of coherent spr characteristics that is suitable for both metal and dielectric gratings .",
    "the predicted radiation from the dielectric grating differs drastically from the spr from the metal one .",
    "there are additional intensive radiation lines because of cr mechanism",
    ". this additional radiation may be useful for the spr based fels because it may intensify the process of the continuous beam bunching .",
    "this assumption , surely , needs additional investigations .    in the experimental part of our investigation",
    "we have compared the characteristics of the coherent spr from the aluminium and teflon lamellar gratings in the same conditions .",
    "this characteristics differ significantly : the radiation from the aluminium grating is situated in the area of large polar angles where it is expected because of the coherent threshold .",
    "the radiation from the teflon grating have clear peak structure , not monotonic one and these peaks are situated in the area of smaller polar angles .",
    "the intensity of radiation from the teflon grating and spr intensity from the aluminum one have the same order of magnitude .",
    "the spectra of radiation in this peaks have complicated structure proving our estimation about additional radiation lines .",
    "also the radiation spectrum in the peak @xmath109deg shows the presence of the @xmath122 mm wavelength that should be significantly suppressed because of our coherent threshold .",
    "that means that the radiation from the teflon grating at this wavelength is strong enough to be measured in spite of the form - factor value equal to @xmath123 in contrast to the radiation from the metal grating that was not detected .",
    "this fact is also promising for creation of new radiation sources based on prebunched electron beams with small dimensions .    in the conclusion",
