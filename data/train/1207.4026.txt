    "optimal transport problems , also known as monge - kantorovich problems , have been very intensively studied in the last years giving rise to numerous and important applications to pde , shape optimization and calculus of variations , so we witnessed a spectacular development of the field .",
    "the interested reader may look at the monographs and lecture notes @xcite where the subject is fully developed .",
    "let us briefly recall the formulations of the monge - kantorovich problems .",
    "let @xmath0 be two compact metric spaces and let @xmath1 be a borel cost function .",
    "the monge problem is formulated as follows : given two probability measures @xmath2 , @xmath3 find a measurable map @xmath4 such that @xmath5 ( @xmath6 denotes the push - forward of measures ) and such that @xmath7 minimizes the total cost , i.e. @xmath8    it may happens that the set of admissible maps is empty ( e.g. @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) .",
    "then the problem could be reformulated in its kantorovich s relaxation : find @xmath11 such that @xmath12 and @xmath13 ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the projections on the factors of @xmath16 ) and such that @xmath17 minimizes the total cost , i.e. @xmath18 the admissible measures @xmath17 for the kantorovich problem are called transport plans .",
    "we denote by @xmath19 the set of transport plans with marginals @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "if @xmath7 is admissible for the monge problem then the measure associated in the usual way to the graph of @xmath7 , i.e. @xmath22 , is admissible for the kantorovich problem . however the class of admissible measures for the kantorovich problem is never empty as it contains @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , the kantorovich problem is a linear one .",
    "existence of minimizers for the monge problem is difficult and may fails , while for the kantorovich problem the semicontinuity of @xmath24 is enough to ensure existence of minimizers .",
    "if @xmath25 , and @xmath26 is the distance function , for @xmath27 the cost @xmath28 defines a distance on @xmath29 called @xmath30-wasserstein distance .    let us recall that by kantorovich duality ( see @xcite ) the @xmath31-wasserstein distance between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which we will simply denote by @xmath32 , can be expressed as follows@xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the set of lipschitz function having lipschitz constant not greater than one .      a relevant tool in mass transportation theory is constituted by the disintegration theorem ( theorem  [ disintegration ] ) of measures which states that every transport plan @xmath35 can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37",
    ". we shall call _ disintegration map _ every @xmath38 such that @xmath39    in this paper we relate the structure of the set of transport plans @xmath19 with the push - forward of disintegration maps . indeed ,",
    "given the measure @xmath40 , obviously @xmath20 is the first marginal of @xmath17 , while the second marginal depends on the disintegration map @xmath41 .",
    "an interesting feature of transport plans appears by looking to the measure @xmath42 .",
    "precisely , if @xmath43 is another transport plan , it results ( see lemma [ push - lemma ] ) : @xmath44 therefore , the second marginals can be fixed by looking to the push - forward of disintegration maps . in this way",
    "the set of transport plans @xmath19 can be structured in transport classes ( see definition [ class ] ) by setting @xmath45 \\leftrightarrow f_\\ # \\mu = g_\\ # \\mu$ ] . roughly speaking ( see example  [ discrete - class ] )",
    ", fixing a transport class leads to consider a constrained transport problem with respect to splitting masses or traveling ones .",
    "lemma  [ push - metric ] shows that all transport plans induced by transport maps belong to the same transport class .",
    "moreover , by density of transport maps in @xmath46 , it follows that ( see proposition  [ prop - class ] ) such transport class characterizes the transport plans induced by transport maps .",
    "+ therefore , in this perspective the monge problem can be seen as a constrained kantorovich problem , namely @xmath47 \\right \\},\\ ] ] for a given transport map @xmath48 . by density of transport maps , the kantorovich transport problem also corresponds to @xmath49}^w \\right \\},\\ ] ] for a given transport map @xmath48 .",
    "+ hence the monge problem represents a particular case of a more rich structure of problems , obtained by fixing a transport class in the kantorovich formulation of transport problems . in this context ,",
    "considering transport problems in a fixed transport class is quite natural .",
    "since we are looking to the push - forward trough disintegration maps , fixing a transport class results equivalent ( see section @xmath50 ) to consider measures @xmath51 satisfying the _ barycenter _ constraint @xmath52 the corresponding transport class is given by the transport plans @xmath53 such that @xmath54 . in this formulation we see that fixing a transport class is equivalent to consider transport maps @xmath41 sending @xmath20 into @xmath55 .",
    "so it is natural to consider the following monge - kantorovich problem in the class @xmath55 : @xmath56 the above transport problem leads to consider an abstract monge problem between the space @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "let us consider the following transport cost @xmath59 we set @xmath60 for every transport class @xmath55 ( see proposition  [ mklambda ] ) we have @xmath61 therefore , every existence result for the monge problem @xmath62 in the abstract setting corresponds to an existence result for the monge - kantorovich problem in the transport class @xmath55 . of course , minimizing in a transport class could be as difficult as for the monge problem since , of course , the transport classes are not in general closed .",
    "however , by this reformulation it comes out that the monge case is peculiar .",
    "more precisely , since the monge problem is a particular case of transportation in a transport class , one may asks what happens for others transport classes .",
    "in other words , the matter consists in establishing if the abstract monge problem admits solutions .",
    "the existence results for the monge problem are usually stated in the following form : under some assumption on the spaces , on the first marginal @xmath20 and on the cost @xmath63 , for every second marginal @xmath21 the monge problem admits solutions .",
    "for the abstract monge problem @xmath64 this is not the case . for discrete measures @xmath55 ,",
    "see section @xmath65 , for the quadratic cost it results that @xmath64 may not admit solutions . therefore , in the abstract setting , it could be also interesting to consider , under some assumption on the spaces , on the first marginal @xmath20 and on the cost @xmath63 , the question for what kind of second marginals the corresponding monge problem admits solutions . from this point of view , in some sense the monge problem is a _",

    "let @xmath88 , be a transport map , observe that for the transport plan @xmath89 , the disintegration theorem yields @xmath90 .",
