    "the g peak corresponds to the e@xmath28 phonon at the brillouin zone centre .",
    "the d peak is due to the breathing modes of sp@xmath9 rings and requires a defect for its activation@xcite .",
    "it comes from to phonons around * * k**@xcite , is active by double resonance ( dr)@xcite and is strongly dispersive with excitation energy due to a kohn anomaly at * * k**@xcite .",
    "the 2d peak is the second order of the d peak .",
    "this is a single band in monolayer graphene , whereas it splits in four in bi - layer graphene , reflecting the evolution of the band structure@xcite .",
    "the 2d peak is always seen , even when no d peak is present , since no defects are required for the activation of two phonons with the same momentum , one backscattering from the other .",
    "dr can also happen as intra - valley process , i.e. connecting two points belonging to the same cone around * k * or * k*. this gives rise to the d peak,@xmath31620@xmath5 in defected graphite .",
    "the 2d is the second order of the d peak .",
    "ref.@xcite , noted that i(d)/i(g ) varies inversely with the cluster size @xmath6 in poly and nano crystalline graphites : i(d)/i(g)=c(@xmath7)/l@xmath8 , where c(514.5 nm ) @xmath3 4.4 nm from refs.@xcite .",
    "the original idea was to link i(d ) to phonon confinement .",
    "the intensity of the non - allowed d peak would be ruled by the defect - induced lifting of the raman fundamental selection rule .",
    "assuming that graphite becomes uniformly nano - crystalline , the d peak evolution can be estimated using heisenberg indetermination principle : i(d)@xmath29q , with @xmath30q@xmath30x@xmath31@xmath32 and @xmath30x@xmath3l@xmath8 .",
    "we now know that the d peak activation is due to dr and not to phonon confinement .",
    "however , also in this case , the higher the number of defects , the higher the chance of phonon - defect scattering and , thus , the higher i(d ) . again , since the g peak is not defect - activated , even within dr , one can expect tk to hold .",
    "now l@xmath8 is an average inter - defect distance , instead of a cluster size .",
    "this is a very simple picture , which has proven effective to compare graphitic samples for increasing disorder .",

    "all can be modeled by a tri - exponential decay with decay constants of 30 , 250 and 1000 ps , with different relative contributions .",
    "remarkably , there is no direct correlation between emission energy and decay dynamics , as would be expected for heterogeneously broadened systems . in this case ,",
    "spectral diffusion due to energy migration would lead to faster decay in the blue spectral range and a delayed signal rise on the same time scale in the red@xcite .",

    "<S> the absence of pl in mlg means that emission from the topmost layer is quenched by subjacent un - treated layers . </S>",
    "<S> this opens the possibility of engineering sandwiched hybrid structures consisting of plg and a variable number of pristine graphene layers .    </S>",
    "<S> oxygen plasma etching is expected to yield co and co@xmath1 , by successively removing carbon atoms . </S>",
    "<S> etching of graphite occurs both in the basal plane and at defects@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is consistent with our observation of point - like pl features for short treatment times ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_image](a ) ) </S>",
    "<S> .    it would be tempting to interpret the pl emission as coming from electron confinement in sp@xmath9 islands with an average size of @xmath31 nm , as indicated by raman spectroscopy . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , since electrons in graphene behave as massless particles , energy quantization due to confinement is expected to open a gap @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting quantum confined energy for a quantum disk of diameter d=2 nm is 1ev . </S>",
    "<S> the observed emission energy distribution translates into a diameter distribution ranging from 0.94 to 1.29 nm , in agreement with the raman estimation . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the large spectral width of the pl signal , @xmath30.5ev , could result from a superposition of overlapping bands with narrow linewidth centered at different size - controlled ( or quantum confined ) energies , corresponding to heterogeneous broadening . </S>",
    "<S> then , the optical properties of the plg would resemble those of pi - conjugated polymer films , where a distribution of conjugation lengths translates into a strong in - homogenously broadened density of states@xcite . at room temperature , laser irradiation in the red would lead to selective excitation of a subset of quantum confined states . </S>",
    "<S> then , spectral hole burning , i.  e. the selective photobleaching of this subset of homogenously broadened lines , should be possible . </S>",
    "<S> this bleaching could be a photochemical modification or even a complete removal of the absorbing subset . as a result we would observe a spectral hole , </S>",
    "<S> i.e. the subset absorbing a certain color would not contribute to pl . </S>",
    "<S> fig.5 plots the ratio of pl measured before ( @xmath21 ) and after ( @xmath22 ) exposure to high power ( @xmath23600@xmath4w ) pulsed laser light at 647 nm . </S>",
    "<S> the pl is measured at 530 nm for low excitation power ( @xmath24w ) . </S>",
    "<S> no spectral hole is observed in the detected spectral range , as would be expected for a heterogeneous ensemble of narrow bandwidth emitters . </S>",
    "<S> instead , only an irreversible and uniform reduction of pl intensity occurs . for other bleaching energies in the red spectral range ( 760,800 nm ) </S>",
    "<S> the same uniform decrease is observed , while in the blue ( 473,514 nm ) the pl slightly shifts to shorter wavelength ( see fig.1c ) .    a)pl intensity ratio for the area indicated by the circle in b ) . , width=302 ]    thus , we find that the observed large spectral width of 0.5ev reflects mainly homogenous broadening , uniform across the plg sheet . </S>",
    "<S> this is supported by the absence of spectral diffusion in the time - resolved data , expected for heterogeneous films@xcite ( see methods ) . </S>",
    "<S> if pl would indeed result from quantum confined states  @xcite , size - related heterogenoeus broadening would need to be far smaller , probably below 0.1ev , requiring a very narrow size distribution of @xmath250.04 nm , instead of the @xmath260.18 nm needed for the 0.5ev broadening . </S>",
    "<S> since oxidation is expected to occur at different lattice sites and configurations , such high degree of ordering would seem unreasonable . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , while for increasing oxidation times a successive decrease of the effective size distribution would be expected , the spectral characteristics of the pl emission remain nearly constant . in conclusion , although the identification of @xmath6 as the quantum confinement length of massless electrons would be tempting , we rather assign the observed pl to co - related localized electronic states at the oxidation sites .    in summary , we have shown that spatially uniform pl can be induced in single - layer graphene on substrates by selective plasma oxidiation . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , bi- and mutli - layer flakes remain non - luminescent , while their elastic scattering spectra indicate the formation of sandwich - like structures containing unetched layers . the resulting photoluminescent material could pave the way towards graphene - based optoelectronics .    </S>",
