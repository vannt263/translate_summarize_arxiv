    "theorem [ three pure detect ] shows that there exist a complete set of entanglement witnesses to identify all kinds of possible pure three - qubit entanglement : fully separable , three types of biseparable entanglement and genuine entangled states .",
    "compared with usual bell inequality , which requires infinitely many measurements of observables , our local operators are fixed . in another word , to detect and differentiate pure three - qubit entanglement , one only needs to measure the coincidence probabilities : @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 in @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these finite and deterministic measurements make the experimental entanglement detection simpler .    for multipartite high dimensional pure state",

    "for example , an @xmath46-partite system can be genuine entangled , @xmath47 different biseparable , @xmath48 different tripartite separable , @xmath49 , fully separable",

    "hence all pure state entanglement could be detected completely by measuring the expectation values of local observables .",
    "to detect entanglement of mixed states is much more complicated . even for a known mixed state ,",
    "one has no general approach to judge its separability . in order to identify the entanglement of a three - qubit mixed state @xmath9 , here we give two kinds inequalities to detect three - qubit entanglement in terms of the expectation values of complementary observables .",

    "if @xmath62 the orientation of the basis formed by the three real vectors @xmath63 is right - handed , the same definition of orientation applies to @xmath58 .",

    "@xmath59 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 we mean that they have the same orientations as the default",
    ".    [ th mixed-1 ] for any three - qubit mixed state @xmath9 , if it is separable under the partition @xmath4 and @xmath6 , then it satisfies @xmath66 for all complementary local observables .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th mixed-1 ] can be derived analogously in the light of the second part of the proof of the main result in ref .",
    "this theorem tells us that if @xmath67 for some complementary local observables , then quantum state @xmath9 is not separable under the partition @xmath4 and @xmath6 and it is surely entangled .",
    "similarly , if @xmath9 is separable under the partition @xmath5 and @xmath6 , then it satisfies @xmath68 for all complementary local observables and if @xmath9 is separable under the partition @xmath4 and @xmath5 , then it satisfies @xmath69 for all complementary local observables .",
    "next , we illustrate the capability of theorem [ th mixed-1 ] in detecting entanglement by some examples .",
    "example 1 . for quantum state @xmath70 with @xmath71 , it has @xmath72 if we take @xmath73 , and @xmath74 with @xmath75 , @xmath24 .",
    "so @xmath76 is identified as an entangled state by theorem [ th mixed-1 ] .",
    "example 2 . for quantum state @xmath77 where @xmath78    ( \\sqrt{\\frac{1+b}{2}}|00\\rangle + \\sqrt{\\frac{1-b}{2}}|10\\rangle ) , \\\\[2 mm ]             \\end{array}\\ ] ] @xmath79 is entangled and positive under arbitrary partial transposition for @xmath80 .",
