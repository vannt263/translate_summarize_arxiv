    "a supernova ( sn ) , the explosion of a star , is one of the most energetic single events in the universe . thousands of optical sne are now known but most of them are at cosmological distances .",

    "in addition , several sne and supernova remnants ( snrs ) were discovered at radio wavelengths in dust - obscured galaxies , such as m82 , arp 299 , and arp 220 , and observed with vlbi .",
    "all of the sne observed with vlbi are thought to have resulted from the core collapse of a massive progenitor and emit synchrotron radiation generated from the electrons accelerated in the region where the shock front interacts with the circumstellar medium ( csm ) left over from the wind of the mass - losing progenitor .",
    "in addition , some of the radiation may come from the environment of the stellar corpse , a neutron star or a black hole left over from the explosion . during the early stage of the expansion of a radio sn ,",
    "the radio lightcurve rises quickly because of the decreasing optical depth due to synchrotron self - absorption or to thermal absorption in the ionized csm along the line of sight .",

    "global vlbi with vsop-2 promises to increase the angular resolution at this wavelength to 0.2 mas and to a correspondingly higher resolution at shorter wavelengths , enabling us to witness the aftermath of the explosion shortly after shock breakout .",

    "the new component has a spectrum which was inverted between 5 and 20 ghz when first discovered .",
    "the peak is slowly moving to lower frequencies .",
    "the inverted part of the spectrum can be interpreted as being due to free - free absorption within the sn shell with the absorption weakening as the shell expands .",
    "the new component could be radio emission associated with accretion onto a black hole or the nebula formed around an energetic young neutron star in the center of sn  1986j , which would be the first direct link of a black hole or a neutron star to a modern sn .",
