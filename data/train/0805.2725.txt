    "advances in nano - fabrication are increasingly enabling us to create nano - scale devices that exhibit non - classical or quantum - mechanical behaviour .",
    "such quantum devices are of great interest as they may pave the way for a new generation of quantum technology with various applications from quantum metrology to quantum information processing .",
    "however , to create quantum devices that perform useful functions , we must be able to understand their behaviour , and have effective means to controllably manipulate it .",
    "analysis of system dynamics and the design of effective control strategies is almost impossible without the availability of sufficiently accurate mathematical models of the device . while these models should capture the essential features of the device , to be useful , they must also be computationally tractable , and preferably as simple as possible .",
    "there are different approaches to deal with this problem .",
    "one , which we shall refer to as a first - principles approach , involves constructing model hamiltonians based on reasonable assumptions about the relevant physical processes governing the behaviour of the system , making various simplifications , and solving the schrodinger equation in some form , usually using numerical techniques such as finite element or functional expansion methods .",
    "the empirical approach , on the other hand , starts with experimental data and observations to construct a model of the system . in practice",
    "both approaches are needed to deal with complex systems .",
    "first - principle models are crucial to elucidate the fundamental physics that governs a system or device , but experimental data is crucial to account for the many unknowns that result in variability of the characteristics of the system , which is often difficult to predict or explain theoretically . for instance , ` manufactured ' systems such as artificial quantum dot ` atoms ' and ` molecules ' vary considerably in size , geometry , internal structure , etc , and sometimes even small variations can significantly alter their behaviour .    in this paper we will focus on constructing mathematical models solely from experimental data without any prior knowledge of the specifics of the system , an approach one might call black - box system identification .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to quantum systems whose essential features can be captured by low - dimensional hilbert space models .",
    "for instance , a quantum dot molecule such as the silicon double quantum dot system in fig .  [ fig : charge - qubit ] may consist of millions of individual atoms with many degrees of freedom , but the observable dynamics may be well described by overall charge distribution states in the quantum dot molecule . taking these charge distribution states as basis states for a hilbert space @xmath0 , the observable dynamics of the system is governed by a hamiltonian operator acting on @xmath0 , and possibly additional non - hermitian operators to account for dissipative effects if the system is not completely isolated from its environment . if the dimension of the hilbert space @xmath0 is huge then complete characterization of the hamiltonian and dissipation operators may be a hopeless task , but in certain cases the dynamics of interest takes place in low - dimensional hilbert space @xmath0 , or we may in fact wish to _ design _ a device whose dynamics can be described by a low - dimensional hilbert space model , as is the case in quantum information processing  @xcite , where we desire to create systems that act as quantum bits , for example .    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start with a general description of the basic assumptions we make about the system to be modelled and the type of measurements and experiments upon which our characterization protocols are based . in section",
    "[ sec : confinement ] we discuss the problem of subspace confinement , i.e. , how to experimentally characterize how well the dynamics of system is confined to a low - dimensional subspace such as a two - dimensional ( qubit ) hilbert space . in section  [ sec : qubit_ident ] we present general protocols for identifying hamiltonian and decoherence parameters for controlled qubit - like systems .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of generalizations and open problems .",
    "we start with a generic model assuming only that the state of the system can be represented by a density operator ( i.e. , a positive operator of trace one ) @xmath1 acting on a hilbert space @xmath0 of dimension @xmath2 , and that its evolution is governed by the quantum liouville equation ( in units such that @xmath3 ) : @xmath4 + \\l_d[\\op{\\rho}(t)],\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is an effective hamiltonian and @xmath6 a super - operator that accounts for dissipative effects due to environmental influences , etc .",
    "initially , all that is known about @xmath5 and @xmath6 is that @xmath5 is a hermitian operator on @xmath0 , and @xmath6 a completely positive super - operator acting on density matrices @xmath7 , although we may make some additional assumptions about the structure of @xmath5 or @xmath6 .",
    "for instance , we shall generally assumes @xmath6 to be of kossakowski - sudarshan - lindblad form  @xcite : @xmath8 = \\sum_{k=1}^{n^2 - 1 } \\gamma_k \\d[\\op{v}_k ] \\op{\\rho}(t)\\ ] ] where the super - operators @xmath9 $ ] are defined by @xmath10b = a b a^\\dagger - ( a^\\dagger a b + b a^\\dagger a)/2,\\ ] ] @xmath11 are ( generally non - hermitian ) operators on @xmath0 and @xmath12 are positive real numbers .",
    "if the system is subject to dynamic control , then the hamiltonian ( and sometimes the relaxation operators @xmath11 ) are not fixed but dependent on external control fields , which we shall denote by @xmath13 . in the simplest case",
    ", we may assume a linear dependence of the hamiltonian on the controls @xmath14 = \\op{h}_0 + \\sum_{m=1}^m f_m(t ) \\op{h}_m,\\ ] ] where the @xmath15 are fixed hermitian operators on @xmath0 and the reservoir operators @xmath11 are constant .",
    "the ultimate objective of characterization is to identify the operators @xmath16 $ ] ( or @xmath15 ) and @xmath6 by performing suitable experiments on the system .",
    "this task would be simplified if we could assume that the system can be prepared in an arbitrary initial state @xmath17 , and that we can perform generalized measurements or projective measurements in arbitrary bases at any time  but these requirements are generally unrealistic .",
    "for example , our ability to perform measurements on the system prior to characterization is limited by the direct readout processes available , and often we only have a single , basic sensor such as a single electron transistor ( set )  @xcite providing relatively limited information about the charge distribution in a quantum dot molecule , or detection may be accomplished via a readout transition that involves coupling one state of the system to a fluorescent read - out state , e.g. , via a laser , etc .",
    "furthermore , preparation of non - trivial states generally depends on knowledge of the operators @xmath16 $ ] and @xmath6 , the very information about the system we are trying to obtain .",
    "these practical restrictions rule out conventional quantum state or process tomography techniques , which presume the ability to measure the system in different measurement bases and prepare it in different initial states to obtain sufficient information to reconstruct the quantum state or process  @xcite .    in this paper we consider a rather typical experimental scenario , where we are limited to measurements of a fixed observable and evolution under a hamiltonian that can be modified by varying certain control settings . for the most part ,",
    "we restrict ourselves further to piecewise constant controls .",
    "the only assumption on the measurement process we make is that it can be formally represented by some hermitian operator @xmath18 with @xmath2 eigenvalues corresponding to measurement outcomes @xmath19 , i.e. , that it has a spectral decomposition of the form @xmath20 this measurement also serves as initialization of the system as outcome @xmath19 means that the system will be left in an eigenstate @xmath21 associated with the eigenvalue @xmath19 .",
    "if @xmath18 has @xmath2 unique eigenvalues , i.e. , all eigenvalues occur with multiplicity one , then the measurement is sufficient to initialize the system in a unique state ; if it has degenerate eigenvalues associated with eigenspaces of dimension greater @xmath22 then some measurement outcomes will not determine the state uniquely .",
    "following the idea of intrinsic characterization , our objective is to extract information about the system without recourse to any external resources , i.e. , using no information from measurements other than the information provided by the sensors built into the device , and no external control fields except the ability to change the settings of the built - in actuators ( such as variable gate voltages ) subject to constraints .",
    "although this requirement of characterization relying only on the built - in sensors and actuators may seem excessively restrictive , excluding many forms of spectroscopy , for example , it has the advantage of simplicity ( no external resources required ) .",
    "moreover , external sensors and actuators may disturb the system , and thus characterization of the system in their presence may not yield an accurate picture of the dynamics in the absence of the additional apparatus .",
    "we restrict ourselves here to systems sufficiently weakly coupled to a sufficiently large reservoir , whose dynamics can be described by adding a dissipation super - operator of the form  ( [ eq : diss ] ) to the hamiltonian dynamics of the subsystem of interest . although many systems can be modelled this way , it should be noted that this approach has limitations .",
    "for example , the dynamics of a subsystem @xmath23 that is strongly is coupled to a finite reservoir @xmath24 , such as single spin coupled to several nearby spins , can be very complicated and non - markovian .",
    "although non - markovian dynamics can in principle be dealt with by allowing time - dependent relaxation operators @xmath11 , in such cases it is not always possible to describe the dynamics of the subsystem of interest in terms of the hamiltonian dynamics on the subspace and a set of simple relaxation or decoherence operators .",
    "rather , it may become necessary to consider the system @xmath25 and characterize its dynamics , described by a schrodinger equation with a hamiltonian @xmath26 , instead to obtain an accurate picture of the subsystem dynamics .",
    "the basic ideas of intrinsic characterization can be applied to this larger system , and the protocols we will describe can in principle be extended to such higher - dimensional systems , although full characterization of the system plus reservoir hamiltonian @xmath26 using only the built - in sensors and actuators may not be possible .",
    "the degree of characterization possible will depend on the size of the hilbert space and the capabilities of the built - in sensors and actuators , e.g. , to discriminate and manipulate different states of the larger system . before attempting to identify the system hamiltonian ( and decoherence operators ) , an important first task is therefore estimating the dimension of the hilbert space in which the dynamics takes place .",
    "a fundamental prerequisite for constructing a hilbert space model is knowledge of the underlying hilbert space .",
    "this is a nontrivial problem as most systems have many degrees of freedom , and thus a potentially huge hilbert space , but effective characterization of the system often depends on finding a low dimensional hilbert space model that captures the essential features of the system .",
    "furthermore , in applications such as quantum information processing the elementary building blocks are required to have a certain hilbert space dimension .",
    "for example , for a quantum - dot molecule to qualify as a qubit , we must be able to isolate a two - dimensional subspace of the total hilbert space , and be able to coherently manipulate states within this 2d subspace without coupling to states outside the subspace ( leakage ) .",
    "this requires several characterization steps :    1 .",
    "isolation of a 2d subspace and characterization of subspace confinement ; 2 .",
    "characterization of the hamiltonian dynamics including effect of the actuators ; and 3 .",
    "characterization of ( non - controllable ) environmental effects ( dissipation ) .",
    "the choice of a suitable subspace depends also on the measurement device as the measurement must be able to distinguish the basis states .",
    "thus for a potential charge qubit device , for example , only a subspace spanned by charge states that can be reliably distinguished by the set is a suitable candidate , and ideally there should be two ( or in general @xmath2 ) orthogonal states that can be perfectly distinguished by the measurement , so that we have a well - defined reference frame ( basis ) @xmath27 , and the measurement can be represented by an observable of the form  ( [ eq : a ] ) with @xmath2 distinct eigenvalues @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , we would like the readout process to act as a projective measurement , so that each measurement projects the state of the system onto one of the measurement basis states @xmath21 .",
    "the ability to perform projective measurements is not a trivial requirement , especially for solid state systems , and is not an absolute necessity as characterization protocols can be adapted to weak measurements , but projective measurements can in principle be achieved with various sensors such as rf - sets , and we shall assume here that we are working in this regime .",
    "after a possible subspace has been identified , it is crucial to check that the subspace is sufficiently isolated , i.e. , that we can reliably initialize the system in a state in this subspace and that it remains in this subspace under both free and controlled evolution .",
    "this characterization of subspace confinement is very important . if the device is a candidate for a qubit , for example , it is essential that subspace leakage be much less than the rate of bit or phase flip errors due to imperfect control or decoherence as leakage or loss error correction protocols are considerably more demanding in terms of complexity and resources required .",
    "characterization of subspace confinement depends on the characteristics of the sensors , i.e. , the type of measurements we can perform . for our charge qubit with set readout example , if the set can be calibrated to be sufficiently sensitive to enable detection of states outside the chosen subspace in addition to being able to discriminate the subspace basis states @xmath21 , i.e. , if the true measurement has ( at least ) @xmath28 mutually exclusive outcomes @xmath19 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 if the system state is outside the subspace , then the characterization of subspace confinement is relatively easy . if we perform @xmath31 experiments of the form    1 .   * initialize : * measure and record outcome @xmath32 2 .",
    "* evolve : * let the system evolve for time @xmath33 under some fixed hamiltonian @xmath34 3 .",
    "* measure : * repeat measurement and record outcome @xmath35    and denote by @xmath36 the number of times the measurement results for the initial and final measurements were @xmath32 and @xmath35 , respectively , then , for @xmath31 sufficiently large , the leakage out of the subspace is approximately equal to the fraction of experiments for which the first measurement was @xmath19 with @xmath37 and the second measurement was @xmath28 , i.e. , @xmath38 repeating the experiments for different evolution times @xmath33 and averaging then gives an indication of the rate of subspace leakage , e.g. , if we estimate @xmath39 for @xmath40 , @xmath41 , then @xmath42    if the set ( or other measurement process ) is not sufficiently sensitive to reliably distinguish at least @xmath2 subspace basis states @xmath21 as well as states outside the subspace , then subspace characterization is more challenging . for instance , suppose we have a 2d subspace and a sensor that can reliably detect only one state , say @xmath43 , a common scenario for many systems where readout transitions are used that detect only a single state . in this case",
    "the measurement outcomes are @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "if the measurement is projective and the dynamics confined to a 2d subspace , we can identify @xmath46 with outcome @xmath47 but this identification will lead to errors if the dynamics is not really confined to a 2d subspace .",
    "however , even in this case we can still estimate the level of confinement to a 2d subspace under the evolution of a hamiltonian @xmath48 from observable coherent oscillations .",
    "for example , let @xmath49 be the probability of obtaining outcome @xmath44 when measuring the time - evolved state @xmath50 .",
    "if the system is initialized in the state @xmath43 and the dynamics of the system under @xmath48 is perfectly confined to a two - level subspace then conservation of probability implies that the heights @xmath51 and @xmath52 of the 0th and 1st order terms in the fourier spectrum of @xmath53 must satisfy @xmath54 .",
    "we can use the deviation from this equality to bound the subspace leakage @xmath55  @xcite : @xmath56 as the upper and lower bounds depend only on the 0th and 1st order fourier peaks , they can usually be easily determined from experimental data although finite resolution due to discretization and projection noise will reduce the accuracy of the estimates  @xcite .",
    "moreover , in this case @xmath57 only indicates the confinement of the system to _ some _ two - level subspace , and we must be careful as for different controls @xmath58 the dynamics under @xmath48 may be confined to _",
    "different _ two - level subspaces , in which case the system can not be considered a proper qubit .",
    "for instance ,",
    "for the 10-level test hamiltonian @xmath59 used for the simulated experiments in figs  [ fig : leakage1 ] and [ fig : leakage2 ] , the first procedure measures the projection onto the subspace @xmath60 spanned by the measurement basis states @xmath61 and @xmath62 , while the second procedure measures the confinement of the dynamics to the best - fitting 2d subspace @xmath63 , which for the given hamiltonian is spanned by @xmath64 and comparison of the results confirms that the average confinement @xmath65 for the subspace @xmath60 as obtained by the first procedure is less ( @xmath66% ) than the confinement for subspace @xmath63 ( @xmath67% ) .",
    "once a suitable subspace has been chosen , we can proceed to the second stage of the characterization , identification of the hamiltonian and decoherence operators .",
    "the simplest type of system we can consider here is a qubit with hilbert space dimension @xmath68 . in this case ,",
    "any non - trivial projective measurement , i.e. , any measurement with two distinguishable outcomes @xmath44 and @xmath47 can be represented by an observable @xmath69 .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath43 and @xmath70 of @xmath18 define a basis for the hilbert space , and we can define the pauli operators @xmath71 ,",
    "@xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 with respect to this basis    @xmath75    or in the usual matrix notation @xmath76 taking ( without loss of generality ) the measurement outcomes to be @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 in this basis . furthermore , we can expand any hamiltonian of the system as    [ eq : h2 ] @xmath80    the @xmath81 term can generally be ignored as the identity @xmath71 commutes with all other pauli matrices and @xmath82 corresponds to multiplication by a global phase factor , i.e. , trivial dynamics .",
    "hence , it suffices to determine the real vector @xmath83 , or in polar form , the angles @xmath84 to determine the hamiltonian . for a single hamiltonian",
    ", we can furthermore choose the coordinate system such that @xmath85 .",
    "however , since @xmath5 depends on control inputs @xmath58 , the parameters @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 also depend on the controls @xmath58 , and we usually need to determine @xmath48 for many different @xmath58 . in this case",
    "we can choose a reference hamiltonian , e.g. , @xmath89 , with @xmath85 , but we must determine the relative angles @xmath88 with respect to the reference hamiltonian for all other control settings .      to relate the hamiltonian parameters to observable dynamics , it is instructive to visualize qubit states and their evolution on the bloch sphere .",
    "if we define @xmath90 with @xmath91 for @xmath92 then it is easy to check that there is a one - to - one correspondence between density operators @xmath1 and points @xmath93 inside the closed unit ball in @xmath94 .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of @xmath95 under the ( constant ) hamiltonian  ( [ eq : h2 ] ) corresponds to a rotation of @xmath96 about the ( unit ) axis @xmath97 with angular velocity @xmath86 as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : bloch ] .",
    "the figure also shows that we can determine the angle @xmath87 and angular frequency @xmath98 from the projection of @xmath96 under the rotation about the axis @xmath99 onto the @xmath100-axis .",
    "as the figure shows , given @xmath101 , we can in principle extract @xmath86 and @xmath87 from the first minimum @xmath102 of @xmath101 , although in practice it is usually preferable to use fourier analysis or harmonic inversion techniques .",

    "let @xmath36 be the number of times the the initial measurement produced outcome @xmath32 and the final measurement produced outcome @xmath35 .",
    "then there are four possible combinations of outcomes @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and @xmath114 , which must add to the total number of experiments @xmath31 . the number of experiments that started in the state @xmath43 [ or @xmath115 is @xmath116 , and the fraction of experiments for which the second measurement yields @xmath44 conditioned on the system starting in the state @xmath43 is @xmath117 .",
    "thus the ensemble average of @xmath79 at time @xmath33 , assuming we started in the state @xmath43 , is @xmath118 and for @xmath119 this relative frequency should approach the true expectation value of @xmath101 assuming @xmath120 .",
    "thus , we can in principle determine @xmath101 to arbitrary accuracy by choosing @xmath31 large enough . by repeating the experiments for different evolution times @xmath121 , e.g. , using a stroboscopic mapping approach ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stobo ] ) , we can determine @xmath101 as a function of @xmath33 , from which we can extract @xmath122 and @xmath123 as discussed .",

    "if the coupling between the system and its environment is stronger then dissipative effects must be directly incorporated into the characterization protocols .",
    "assuming markovian decoherence of the form  ( [ eq : diss ] ) , it is easy to show that for @xmath205 , we have @xmath206 , where @xmath207 are the elementary relaxation operators @xmath208 defined in terms of the pauli matrices @xmath209 , and @xmath210 is some unitary operator in @xmath211 that defines a preferred decoherence basis . the operator @xmath74 is usually associated with pure decoherence ( pure dephasing ) while the raising and lowering operators @xmath212 are associated with population relaxation from @xmath70 to @xmath43 and vice versa . very often it is furthermore assumed that @xmath213 is the identity , i.e. , that the preferred basis for relaxation is the same as the measurement basis .",
    "although this need not be the case , it is often a good approximation .",
    "the main effect of relaxation processes is to dampen the observed coherent oscillations @xmath101 that result from the hamiltonian dynamics , and try to force the system ` asymptotically ' into a ` steady ' state .",
    "this effect manifests itself in lorentzian broadening of the peaks in the oscillation spectrum , which can be used for characterization purposes .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : decoherence ] shows significantly damped oscillations as a result of relaxation .",
    "the fact that the oscillations decay to @xmath214 suggests either pure dephasing , or a symmetric relaxation process with @xmath215 , i.e. , equal probability of relaxation from state @xmath43 to @xmath70 and vice versa , or a combination of both . since symmetric relaxation and pure dephasing",
    "have very similar signatures , it can be difficult to distinguish these processes from the oscillation trace alone . however , if there exists a control @xmath58 such that @xmath216 , which corresponds to a rotation about the @xmath100 ( or measurement ) axis , then we can in principle distinguish the two processes by initializing the system repeatedly in either state @xmath43 or @xmath70 and letting the system evolve under @xmath48 for various periods of time before measuring again .",
    "if the decoherence process is pure dephasing then the system will remain in the initial state , while we expect to observe random jumps ( with equal probability ) for symmetric relaxation . assuming this preliminary characterization step suggests that the damping in the figure is due to pure dephasing",
    ", we can then extract information about the rotation frequency @xmath217 and dephasing rate @xmath218 by fitting a lorentzian envelope function @xmath219 to the first - order peak in the fourier spectrum as shown in the figure .",
    "in our example , using a simple least - squares minimization yields estimated values for both @xmath217 and @xmath218 that are close to the actual values used in the simulated experiment .",
    "this approach can be generalized for more complicated relaxation processes  @xcite . alternatively ,",
    "if we can characterize the hamiltonian dynamics sufficiently to be able to initialize the system in non - measurement basis states and simulate readout in different bases , then generalized lindblad operators can be estimated using repeated process tomography  @xcite .",
    "we have described some basic tools and techniques for characterizing the extent to which the dynamics of a certain system is confined to a low - dimensional subspace of a potentially large hilbert space , as well as for identifying both hamiltonian and decoherence parameters experimentally , with emphasis on protocols that are realistic even in the presence of limited direct readout and control capabilities .",
    "although the explicit schemes presented focused on qubit - like systems , the same basic ideas can be applied to higher - dimensional systems .",
    "however , the number of hamiltonian and decoherence parameters to be determined for higher - dimensional system makes finding explicit protocols for complete characterization quite challenging .",
    "the qubit characterization protocols show that identifying the relative angles between several control hamiltonians requires a two - stage process and more complicated two - step experiments ( initialization in non - measurement basis state followed by controlled evolution ) than identifying the rotation frequency and declination angle for a single hamiltonian . as the dimension of",
    "the system increases more parameters are necessary to fully characterize the hamiltonians , leading to more complex multi - stage characterization protocols .",
    "another problem is that the number of experiments required to implement such schemes may become prohibitively large for parameter estimation based on spectroscopic analysis .",
    "one of the most promising strategies to avoid this problem is the development of efficient adaptive characterization schemes  as opposed to protocols based on regular sampling to minimize the number of measurements / experiments required . for systems composed of separate smaller units such as multi - qubit systems , boot - strapping approaches to characterization may also provide a fruitful alternative .",
    "for example , assuming we have separately characterized individual qubits using qubit identification protocols and therefore have full local control , we can reduce the problem of two - qubit identification in principle to identifying the interaction hamiltonian . for two - qubit systems with local control and a fully non - local interaction hamiltonian",
    "this can be achieved using entanglement mapping or concurrence spectroscopy  @xcite ."
