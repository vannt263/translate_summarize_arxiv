    "if a set is self - similar then it scales in the same way in all directions however far we zoom in , and wherever in the set we zoom in . in this case notions of hausdorff dimension ,",
    "box dimension etc give good characterisations of local and global scaling behaviour .",
    "if , on the other hand , there are different amounts of scaling in different directions , and this difference varies over the set , then this inhomogeneity is not really seen by the standard dimensions .",
    "this phenomenon is present in a number of interesting classes of sets which are currently attracting a great deal of attention including : self - affine sets , non - conformal repellers , parabolic repellers such as parabolic julia sets , and some random constructions . for such sets , assouad dimension , and in particular its difference from box dimension , gives some idea of this inhomogeneity .",
    "however , this value only gives a very superficial measure of inhomogeneity and so , in order to obtain a detailed understanding of the scaling properties , and their inhomogeneity across the set , we perform the first quantitative study of assouad dimension .",
    "we will focus on a classic family of examples : certain compact @xmath0-invariant subsets of the 2-torus .",
    "let @xmath1 be a compact metric space , which we will later assume to be the 2-torus , identified with @xmath2 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "we wish to study the dimension of fractal subsets @xmath3 of @xmath1 via a family of observables based on location and scale . more precisely , given a location @xmath4 and a scale @xmath5",
    ", we wish to describe how ` large ' @xmath3 is in a small set @xmath6 around @xmath7 , where @xmath8 as @xmath9 . in standard cases",
    "@xmath6 would be taken to be an @xmath10-ball , but often , as here , it can be convenient / appropriate to take another type of set , like a generalised cube for instance .",
    "to this end , for @xmath11 , let @xmath12 be the smallest number of sets with diameter no greater than @xmath13 required to cover @xmath14 , where a collection of sets @xmath15 is a cover of @xmath14 if @xmath16 .",
    "we can now describe the size of @xmath17 by computing @xmath18 for @xmath19 and then taking the extremal exponential growth rate of this quantity as @xmath20 .",
    "fix @xmath21 and define the _",
    "@xmath22-local assouad dimension at location @xmath7 at scale @xmath10 _ by @xmath23 the reason for the inclusion of @xmath24 in the above definition is to avoid the supremum taking undesirably high values for @xmath25 .",
    "our interpretation of @xmath26 is the ` best guess ' for the dimension of @xmath3 at location @xmath7 and scale @xmath10 .",
    "the above definition is motivated by the assouad dimension ; a commonly studied and important notion of dimension used to study fractals .",
    "indeed , the assouad dimension was introduced in the 1970s by patrice assouad during his doctoral studies , motivated by questions involving embeddability of metric spaces into euclidean space @xcite . unsurprisingly",
    ", the assouad dimension highlights the _ extreme _ dimensional properties of the set in question and , roughly speaking , returns an exponent representing the _ most difficult _ location and scale at which to cover the set .",
    "the _ assouad dimension _ of a non - empty subset @xmath3 of @xmath1 , @xmath27 , is defined by @xmath28 note that whether one uses boxes or balls ( or any other reasonable family of @xmath10-scale objects ) to define @xmath29 does not alter the definition . for more information on the assouad dimension , including basic properties",
    ", we refer the reader to @xcite .",
    "a related notion is the _ upper box dimension _ , which can be defined by @xmath30 this is clearly related to the assouad dimension , but the key difference is that it is not sensitive to location and gives an overall average dimension rather than the supremum of a localised quantity .",
    "it is always true that @xmath31 , with equality occurring if the set is sufficiently homogeneous : at all scales and locations the set is no more difficult to cover than it is on average over the whole set . for the sets we consider in this paper the upper box dimension will be equal to the related lower box dimension , in which case we just write @xmath32 for the common value .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath33 but in most cases , including the sets we consider in this paper , one has equality and even @xmath34 for sufficiently small @xmath24 .",
    "in fact the quantity on the left hand side of ( [ quasiassouad ] ) defines the quasi - assouad dimension , introduced in @xcite .",
    "since ( quasi-)assouad dimension is determined by the largest @xmath26 , the @xmath22-local assouad dimension at scale @xmath10 , can be over _ all _ @xmath7 , it is a natural question to know how much this quantity varies as @xmath35 varies .",
    "so to consider this question quantitatively , we consider , for an appropriate borel probability measure @xmath36 on @xmath3 and @xmath37 ( or in a suitable range ) , @xmath38 if our set is homogeneous , then @xmath26 is essentially independent of @xmath7 ( the assouad and box dimensions coincide ) , so the quantity in is interesting when there is some inhomogeneity .",
    "a , by now classic , and elementary , example of an inhomogeneous limit set is provided by bedford - mcmullen carpets , and for this first quantitative analysis of inhomogeneity , we focus on this class .",
    "indeed , our main theorem shows that the quantity in satisfies a large deviation principle as @xmath39 , with a rate function which we give explicitly .",
    "we then give examples of limit sets @xmath14 and @xmath3 for which @xmath40 , but the inhomogeneity can be seen to be stronger for @xmath3 via the rate of large deviations .",
    "we also prove a central limit theorem ( clt ) for the variable @xmath26 .",
    "this is less directly connected to assouad dimension since , the set of points being measured here are not the set of points at which the assouad dimension is ` achieved ' . however , this does give some further information on inhomogeneity .",
    "we note that in the case of measures of balls , compared to the local dimension , a clt was proved in @xcite for certain classes of non - conformal dynamical systems similar to those considered here .",
    "the ideas in this paper extend to a wide class of examples of inhomogeneous fractals .",
    "we note that , for interesting results , it is important that the inhomogeneity varies across the fractal .",
    "this means that , for example , the large deviations for limit sets of mandelbrot percolation will be degenerate",
    ". we would expect large deviation principles for general self - affine sets , including the more general carpets introduced in @xcite , higher dimensional analogues @xcite , and generic self - affine sets in the setting of falconer @xcite , for example",
    ". it would be particularly interesting , and technically challenging , to consider genuinely ` parabolic ' systems , related to @xcite , where the canonical measures would be expected to give polynomial large deviations .",
    "we will study the type of large deviations problem discussed in the previous section for a class of @xmath0-invariant sets , i.e. compact subset of the 2-torus which are invariant under the endomorphism @xmath41 for @xmath42 with @xmath43 .",

    "the second term relates to the dimension of fibres : for the assouad dimension , @xmath71 is the maximal fibre dimension ( also given by a self - similar set ) and for the box dimension , the second term can be interpreted as an ` average fibre dimension ' , observing that @xmath72 is the arithmetic average of the @xmath73 .",
    "the box and assouad dimensions coincide if and only if @xmath73 is the same for all @xmath74 , commonly referred to as the _ uniform fibres case_. in this case our subsequent analysis is not very interesting and so from now on we will assume that the @xmath73 are not uniform .",

    "the choice of @xmath75 depends on which measure one considers to be canonical for a particular study . if one wants the measure of maximal entropy , then @xmath81 for all @xmath82 .",
    "if one wants the measure of maximal ( hausdorff ) dimension , then we consider the mcmullen measure , with weights : @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the hausdorff dimension .",
    "another natural choice is a measure which is uniform on the column structure , i.e. any choice of @xmath85 satisfying @xmath86 ( for all @xmath74 ) .",

    "moreover , this is the only known invariant probability measure which realises the assouad dimension .",
