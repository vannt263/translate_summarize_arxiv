    "thermodynamic bethe ansatz ( tba ) equations have been used to investigate thermodynamics of various kind of solvable lattice models ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "traditionally , tba equations have been derived by the string - hyposesis @xcite .",
    "several years ago , tba equations for the supersymmetric @xmath4 model and the supersymmetric extended hubbard model were derived @xcite from the @xmath1-system ( a system of functional relations among transfer matrices ) for the quantum transfer matrix ( qtm ) @xcite , which is independent of the string hypothesis . later on , tba equations for the @xmath5-model in the regime @xmath6 @xcite , the @xmath7 model @xcite , the @xmath8 model @xcite were derived by the similar procedures in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the tba equation in @xcite was analytically continued @xcite to the one for @xmath9 .",
    "these tba equations contain an infinite ( or finitely many ) number of unknown functions , and thus are not always easily treated .",
    "it is significant to simplify the tba equations to tractable integral equations which contain only a finite number of unknown functions .    in the context of the qtm method , for models related to algebras of rank one or two ,",
    "nonlinear integral equations ( nlie ) with finite numbers of unknown functions were derived by klmper and his collaborators @xcite .",
    "although their nlie give the same free energy as tba equations , the derivations need trial and error for each model , which prevents their extension to higher rank case .",
    "another type of nlie with only one unknown function was proposed for the @xmath5 spin chain by takahashi @xcite recently .",
    "one can also derive @xcite takahashi s nlie from the @xmath1-system @xcite of the qtm . in view of this fact ,",
    "we have derived @xcite nlie with a finite number of unknown functions from our @xmath1-system @xcite for the @xmath8 model for arbitrary rank @xmath10 . in this paper",
    ", we shall further derive nlie for the @xmath0 uimin - sutherland model @xcite with only a _",
    "finite _ number ( the number of rank @xmath11 ) of unknown functions from the @xmath1-system @xcite .",
    "this is the first explicit derivation of this type of nlie for a vertex model associated with @xmath0 for _ arbitrary _ rank @xmath11 in section 2 , we introduce the @xmath0 uimin - sutherland model , and define the qtm and the @xmath1-system @xcite related to this model . in section 3 , we derive traditional tba equations from the @xmath1-system defined in section 2 without using the string hypothesis . in section 4",
    ", we derive the nlie ( [ nlie3 ] ) , ( [ nlie4 ] ) , which are our main results . the normalized fused qtm @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ; @xmath14 : the fusion degree of the model ) in the trotter limit @xmath15 defined in section 2 play the role of the unknown functions of these nlie . the traditional tba equations ( [ tba-1 ] ) , ( [ tba-2 ] ) , ( [ tba-3 ] )",
    "are integral equations on the variables @xmath16 , which connects with the ones @xmath12 for our new nlie ( [ nlie3 ] ) through the relation ( [ y - fun ] ) ( cf .",
    "@xmath17 ) . in this sense",
    ", we may viewed our new nlie ( [ nlie3 ] ) as tba equations on the variables @xmath12 .",
    "for the evaluation of the free energy , we need only the fundamental one @xmath18 . therefore adopting an infinite number of fused qtm @xmath12 as unkown functions seems to be superfluous .",
    "in fact we see that these nlie ( [ nlie3 ] ) for @xmath19 form a closed set of equations ( [ nlie4 ] ) , which contains only a _",
    "finite _ number of unknown functions @xmath20 . for @xmath2 ,",
    "this set of nlie ( [ nlie4 ] ) reduces to takahashi s nlie @xcite for the @xmath3 spin chain . on the other hand , nlie ( [ nlie3 ] ) for @xmath21",
    "have never been considered before , and then they are new equations even in the case @xmath2 . using our new nlie ( [ nlie4 ] ) , we calculate the high temperature expansion of the free energy in section 5 .",
    "section 6 are devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "many calculations in this paper are parallel with the ones for the @xmath8 case @xcite ; but we will describe calculations concisely , not so much for reader s convenience , but for basic importance of the uimin - sutherland model .",
    "we shall introduce the @xmath0 uimin - sutherland model @xcite , and define the qtm @xcite and the @xmath1-system @xcite for this model .",
    "qtm analyses of the uimin - sutherland model can be found in @xcite .",
    "the classical counter part of the @xmath0 uimin - sutherland model is a special case of the perk - schultz model , whose @xmath22-matrix@xcite is given as @xmath23 where @xmath24 ; @xmath25 .",
