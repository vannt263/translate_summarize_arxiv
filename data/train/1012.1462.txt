    "the electric part of the stress ( maxwell stress ) can be expressed by ( see again @xcite ) @xmath25 where @xmath26 . with these positions and without loss of generality ,",
    "the total current stress in an incompressible , isotropic elastic and dielectrically homogeneous body can be expressed as @xmath27 having set @xmath28 . thus , the principal stresses have the values @xmath29",

    "the reference configuration is a stress free state with zero applied voltage ; we here assume that this configuration coincides with a right cylindrical region with flat mid - surface @xmath30 and constant thickness @xmath31 . under the assumption that @xmath31 is small",
    "as compared with @xmath30 ` diameter ' , we embrace the _ membrane approximation _ which asserts that the bending stiffness is zero and that any in - plane compressive stress immediately leads to the membrane buckling , with the appearance of wrinkled regions .    according with most common application schemes of eaps",
    "we assume that @xmath30 remains flat after deformation .",

    "of course this hypothesis fails at the boundary of the membrane and in correspondence with possible deformation localization , but typically , with the hypothesis of small thickness , this approximation can be energetically justified ( e.g. @xcite ) . under the described assumptions , if a voltage @xmath34 is applied to the electrodes , then the electric field at any point of the current configuration amounts to @xmath35    while the approach that we consider in the following is general , to fix the ideas , we here consider a diffuse constitutive assumption for polymeric materials , i.e. the mooney - rivlin constitutive model , characterized by constant response functions : @xmath36 with @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",

    "consider a state of local uniaxial stress in direction ( say ) @xmath48 ; under the assumption @xmath49 , the transverse stretch in direction @xmath50 assumes a specific value called _ natural width _ in tension , which is constitutively dependent on the stretch @xmath51 in direction @xmath48 @xmath52 since for @xmath53 it is @xmath54 , any attempt to reduce the transverse stretch under this value requires a the application of a compressive stress , leading to the formation of wrinkles ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) .",

    "moreover , we remark that in this analysis we consider only compression induced instabilities , but other types of purely mechanical or electromechanical instabilities can be important ( see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "for large stretches the entropic hardening effect , which is not accounted by the neo - hookean law , can play an important role in modifying the @xmath65 region ( see e.g. fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "consider first the case of an eap membrane under an assigned voltage @xmath34 ( see the scheme in fig.[fig5 ] ) and no prestretch at the boundaries . by imposing",

    "thus the thickness of the membrane grows with @xmath76 so that we may argue that this equilibrium solution is unstable .",
    "this is in accordance with the results in @xcite where two equilibrium solutions have been obtained for each value of the activation parameter and the larger equilibrium stretch corresponds to an unstable state .    based on previous analysis , we may deduce that when we increase @xmath76 there exists a critical value of @xmath94 for which the tensile region disappears .",
    "this maximum activation value grows with the stiffness of the material .",

    "after this threshold no equilibrium solution is possible .",
    "this effect represents what is called in the literature as pull - in instability ( see @xcite ) .",
    "consider now the hypothesis that a prestretch @xmath95 is assigned in direction ( say ) @xmath58 of a rectangular eap membrane ( see fig.[fig6 ] ) .",
