    "( 1992 ) with the cobe - dmr experiment , are believed to be generated by the interaction of matter density perturbations and radiation to first order in perturbation theory .",
    "numerical codes used to solve the linearized einstein - boltzmann coupled equations are able to calculate the radiation power spectrum with an accuracy better than @xmath4 ( see e.g. sugiyama 1996 , seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 , bond 1995 ) .",
    "nonlinear density perturbations make a small contribution through the rees - sciama effect which , except for the case of reionization , can be constrained to be @xmath5 ( martnez - gonzlez , sanz and silk 1992 , sanz et al .",
    "1996 , seljak 1996a , tuluie , laguna & anninos 1996 ) .",
    "however , the effect of gravitational lensing on the cmb anisotropies , not included in the numerical codes , may appreciably affect the radiation power spectrum .",
    "many groups have studied the lensing of the microwave photons using different analytical and numerical approaches ( blanchard & schneider 1987 ; cole & efstathiou 1989 ; sasaki 1989 ; tomita & watanabe 1989 ; linder 1990a , b ; cayn , martnez - gonzlez & sanz 1993a , b ; fukushige , makino & ebisuzaki 1994 ; seljak 1996b ) .",
    "they arrive at different conclusions about the importance of the effect : the result depends on the particular cosmological model considered and on the asumptions made in the calculation .",
    "cayn et al .",
    "1993a , b present the formalism to obtain the lensing of the microwave photons by the large scale matter distribution in a flat universe with null / non - null cosmological constant .",
    "however they erroneously used the photon deflection angle instead of the photon angular excursion on the last scattering surface relative to its observed value , which leads to a factor of a few overestimate of the relative dispersion between two photons ( seljak 1996b , muoz & portilla 1996 ) .",
    "some of the previous studies have used models that may not be a realistic representation of the large - scale structure observed ( e.g. the models used in fukushige et al .",
    "1994 ) . another relevant ingredient of the calculations is to appropriately account for the evolution of matter density perturbations .",
    "recently , seljak ( 1996b ) has done a relevant step in solving those shortcomings of previous studies .",
    "based on a power spectrum approach he includes linear and nonlinear regimes of the matter evolution in realistic cosmological models and generalizes the formalism to open universes .",
    "however , results on the radiation power spectrum are not presented for open universes . moreover , the nonlinear power spectrum evolution considered in that paper is not valid for spectral indexes @xmath6 ( as in the case of cdm for small scales ) and for @xmath7 universes ( peacock and dodds 1996 ) .    in this paper",
    "we present a formalism to calculate the lensing effect in flat and open cosmological models and in two different gauges . except for velocity and acceleration terms associated to the observer and the source which either do not contribute or the contribution is negligible , we show that the equations which provide the lensing effect are the same for the conformal newtonian and synchronous - comoving gauges .",
    "results for the effect of lensing on the radiation power spectrum are presented for cdm models with @xmath8 .",
    "we consider linear and nonlinear evolution for the matter power spectrum .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section ii we describe the formalism to calculate the gravitational lensing effect .",
    "the results obtained for cdm open models are presented in section iii .",

    "we shall not consider a cosmological @xmath10-term , but the generalization to include @xmath11 is very easy . for scalar perturbations ,",

    "the gravitational potential satisfies the poisson equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the density perturbation .",
    "the green s function associated to the previous equation can be found in the literature ( death 1976 , traschen and eardley 1986 ) .",
    "we are interested in the effect of gravitational lensing on high multipoles ( @xmath18 ) of the cmb .",
    "only the smaller scales are contributing to such effect , so curvature will show related to the angular distance .",
    "in fact , the green s function on such scales can be approximated by @xmath19 where the distance between the two points @xmath20 ( being @xmath21 and @xmath22 two unit vectors in the directions of observation ) is given by the equation ( @xmath23 ) @xmath24^{1/2},\\ \\ \\",

    "the lensing vector for a flat universe has been given by kaiser ( 1992 ) .",
    "for the open case , pyne & birkinshaw ( 1996 ) and seljak ( 1996b ) have used a window function @xmath47 that agrees after a straightforward calculation with our equation ( 12 ) .",
    "once we have obtained the expression for the trajectory of the photon in the conformal newtonian gauge , it is easy to calculate everything in the conformal synchronous - comoving gauge .",
    "the infinitesimal transformation connecting both gauges is @xmath48 the expressions for @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be obtained taking into account that in the synchronous - comoving gauge one has zero velocity ( @xmath51 ) , i. e. @xmath52 and the metric has the following components : @xmath53 .",

    "the velocity of the fluid in the conformal newtonian gauge is given by @xmath61 , from which @xmath62 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 being the growing mode ) .",
    "taking this into account one can easily understand that the new terms appearing in equation ( 17 ) can be interpreted as doppler contributions at recombination and at the observer and an acceleration term at the observer . for a flat model ( @xmath57 )",
    ", we explicitly have @xmath65}_{\\bot},\\ ] ] where the linear gravitational potential , @xmath66 , is time - independent and @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the ratio of these terms , as they appear in equation ( 18 ) , to the angular scale is negligible ( @xmath70 is given by the doppler velocity respect to the cmb and @xmath71 can be estimated from our local infall towards either the virgo cluster or the great attractor ) .",
    "a similar reasoning can be applied to open universes .",
    "therefore , the lensing vector @xmath41 in the synchronous - comoving gauge ( that is the appropriate one from the point of view of the observations ) is approximately given by @xmath41 , as defined by equation ( 12 ) .",
    "the correlation function @xmath73 including gravitational lensing is calculated as the average @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the temperature anisotropy field , @xmath21 and @xmath76 are two directions such that @xmath77 . by introducing 2d - fourier components of the temperature anisotropies",

    "with the formalism presented in the previous section , we have calculated the dispersion of lensing @xmath117 and the anisotropic term of the correlation of lensing @xmath118 as given by equations ( 33 - 34 ) .",
    "we assume a cdm model with a primordial harrison - zeldovich spectrum , a hubble parameter @xmath120 ( @xmath121 km s@xmath122 mpc@xmath122 ) and flat and open universe models .",
    "the radiation power spectrum not including lensing is normalized to the 2-year cobe - dmr map as given by the analysis of cayn et al .",
    "( 1996 ) ( this normalization does not appreciably change with the 4-year data ) .",
    "however , since the lensing effect is generated by small scales , @xmath123 mpc , it might be more sensible to use the normalization @xmath124 for universes with @xmath125 following viana and liddle ( 1996 ) .",
    "this normalization is based on the cluster abundance ( see also white , efstathiou and frenk 1993 , eke , cole and frenk 1996 ) . for the nonlinear evolution of the power spectrum we use the recently improved fitting formula given by peacock and dodds ( 1996 ) .",
    "that formula is based on the hamilton et al .",
    "( 1991 ) scaling procedure to describe the transition between linear and nonlinear regimes .",
    "it accounts for the correction introduced by jain , mo and white ( 1995 ) for spectra with @xmath126 and applies to flat as well as to open universes .    in figure 2 it is shown the relative dispersion @xmath127 and the anisotropic term @xmath128 for three values of the density parameter @xmath129 .",
    "linear and nonlinear matter evolutions have been considered for comparison .",
    "discrepances between the two regimes can be noticed at scales @xmath130 . at scales",
    "@xmath131 @xmath127 as well as @xmath132 are below @xmath133 being slightly larger as @xmath0 increases . also , notice that @xmath134 in all cases ( as expected from the considerations made in the previous section ) .",
    "therefore , the anisotropic term should in principle be considered when calculating the distortions on the radiation power spectrum contrary to the isotropic approximation often made in the literature ( we confirm this statement below ) .",
    "lensing becomes negligible at angular scales above a few degrees .",
    "the radiation power spectrum including and not including lensing is given in figure 3a .",
    "it is clear from this picture that the effect of lensing is to slightly smooth the main features appearing in the spectrum , in particular the secondary acoustic peaks ( also called doppler or sakharov ) .",
    "the relative changes of the spectrum due to lensing as a function of the multipole @xmath135 are shown in figures 3b , c .",
    "the changes produced grow with @xmath135 and in the same range of @xmath135 increase with @xmath0 .",
    "note , however , that for the same acoustic peak the variation increases when @xmath0 decreases and the reason for this is the smaller scales involved for which the lensing effect is more effective . considering nonlinear evolution does not change the lensing contribution to the @xmath136 for @xmath137 as can be seen in figure 3b .",
    "we have also computed the contribution of the isotropic term to the @xmath136 coefficients and the result is shown in figure 3c .",
    "this contribution is slightly smaller than the total effect and for some multipoles the discrepancy can be significant .",
    "therefore , in general both terms , isotropic and anisotropic , should be considered in the calculation of the radiation power spectrum with lensing .",
    "the effect of lensing can be as much as @xmath138 for multipoles @xmath139 and @xmath140 for @xmath137 .",
    "therefore , if one wants to compute the radiation power spectrum for a particular cosmological model with an accuracy better than @xmath4 such effect should be considered .",
    "bending of the microwave photons due to the large - scale structure should be considered when analysing data provided by future very sensitive cmb experiments ( e.g. cobras / samba ) .",
    "a formalism has been developed to calculate the lensing effect on the primary cmb radiation power spectrum .",
    "this formalism provides an expression for the lensing vector in flat and open universes which is approximately the same in both the conformal newtonian and comoving - synchronous gauges .",
    "in particular , we give the window function @xmath47 for open models in terms of the distance to the photon from the observer .",
    "the influence of gravitational lensing on the @xmath72s has been obtained in terms of the bending dispersion @xmath141 and anisotropic bending correlation @xmath142 .",
    "it is found that the contribution of @xmath142 to the lensing distortion of the radiation power spectrum is smaller than that of @xmath141 .",
    "however this contribution is not negligible and should be considered in the calculation of the radiation power spectrum with lensing .",
    "we use the recently improved fitting formula for the evolution of the nonlinear matter power spectrum which provides an accuracy better than @xmath143 for the scales considered ( peacock and dodds 1996 ) .",
    "this improvement over previous works ( peacock and dodds 1993 ; jain , mo and white 1995 ) generates a larger lensing dispersion at small scales for open models , as compared with seljak ( 1996 ) . in spite of this",
    ", the contribution of nonlinear evolution to the distortion of the radiation power spectrum is negligible .    for flat as well as open universes ,",
    "the effect of lensing is to slightly smooth the primary radiation power spectrum of the cmb . for a given range of multipoles the relative change of @xmath136 due to lensing increases with @xmath0 .",
    "however , for the same acoustic peak it decreases with @xmath0 .",
    "the maximum contribution of lensing to the radiation power spectrum for @xmath144 is @xmath140 for @xmath0 values in the range @xmath3 .",
