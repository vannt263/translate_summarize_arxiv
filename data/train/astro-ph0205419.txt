    "it is generally believed that dark matter constitutes a large fraction of the mass in the universe . among various theories of dark matter ,",
    "cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory provides a remarkably successful description of large - scale structure formation , and it is in good agreement with a large variety of observational data .",
    "this model predicts that small objects are the first to form and these then amalgamate into progressively larger system .",
    "this means that galaxy clusters have formed via merging and accretion of galaxies or galaxy groups .",
    "if the dark matter is actually the main component of galaxies and clusters , @xmath0-body simulations can be used to predict their bulk properties , such as position , mass , and size .",
    "however , it has proven difficult to find surviving substructure ( subhalos ) in virialized objects in @xmath0-body simulations . this apparent absence of substructure , known as `` the overmerging problem , '' reflects the fact that simulated subhalos are disrupted much more efficiently than real subhalos @xcite .",
    "analytical studies showed that the overmerging problem was caused by poor force and mass resolutions @xcite .",
    "@xcite estimated that the force and mass resolutions required for a simulated halo to survive in galaxy groups and clusters are extremely high : @xmath1  kpc and @xmath2 .",
    "recently , simulations with roughly the required resolution have been done @xcite .",
    "these simulations certainly showed that subhalos survive in clusters .",
    "@xcite compared the mass distribution function ( mdf ) of subhalos with the press - schechter ( ps ) mdf @xcite and a conditional mdf derived through an extension of the ps formalism ( eps ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see  [ sec : mdf ] for detail ) .",
    "they found that the mdf of subhalos in their simulated cluster at @xmath3 is similar to the ps mdf at @xmath4 .",
    "it is also similar to the eps mdf but the fit is a little worse .",
    "they suggested that the mdf of subhalos freezes out after the cluster had grown sufficiently , which in their simulation occurred at @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the mdf of subhalos preserves the information about the growth of density fluctuations at that time .",
    "in other words , we can use observations of the mdf of subhalos at present to determine the hierarchical clustering which occurred in the past .",
    "however , the good match between the simulations and the ps mdf found by @xcite is somewhat surprising as the ps mdf does not take into account the fact that the cluster subhalos are in a high density region .",
    "the eps mdf does include the density effect , yet provides a slightly worse fit to the simulations than the ps mdf .",
    "another important factor that should be taken into account when the mdf of subhalos in a cluster is considered is the spatial correlation of initial density fluctuations .",
    "it has been shown that this spatial correlation does affect the mdf of dark halos in the whole universe @xcite .",
    "this means that one can not ignore the effect of spatial correlation on the mdf of subhalos because these subhalos originated from density fluctuations that were close to one another . in this paper , we construct a model of the subhalo mdf in a cluster considering the effect of spatial correlations as well as the fact that cluster subhalos are located in a high density region .",
    "of course , there are other mechanisms that could affect the mdf of subhalos especially after the cluster formation ( e.g. tidal stripping ) .",
    "although they should be taken into account in order to derive the mdf exactly , we do not consider them in our model for the sake of simplicity .",
    "even so , our model should be useful to predict the mdf in the case where the mechanisms that occur after cluster formation are not very effective , and gives an upper limit to substructure if disruptive processes are important for a wide range of masses .",
    "our analytic model is not affected by spatial and mass resolutions , which affect numerical simulations .",
    "it will be useful to compare with the results of numerical simulations to determine the effects of finite resolution . even though some of the recent high - resolution simulations meet fully the conditions required to study subhalos @xcite , comparing them with our model is still important .",
    "such comparisons can serve as a check for the subhalo identification algorithm applied to the simulation results .",
    "both the mdfs predicted by our model and the results from numerical simulations should be compared with the observations . in the past , galaxies were used to derive the observed mdf in a cluster .",
    "in fact , @xcite compared their simulation results with the observational data from the virgo cluster , although they used the circular velocity distribution function ( vdf ) of galaxies instead of the mdf .",
    "they showed that the simulation and observed vdfs are roughly consistent with one another .",
    "however , individual galaxies could not be used to detect massive subhalos , because the observed circular velocity ( or velocity dispersion ) of a galaxy is at most @xmath6 . on the other hand",
    ", numerical simulations suggest that clusters have subhalos with @xmath7 @xcite . until recently",
    ", it was not understood whether the lack of galaxies with @xmath8 requires a lack of massive subhalos in a cluster , or whether this implies that galaxies have lower values of @xmath9 than would characterize the massive dark matter halos surrounding the galaxies .",
    "recently , x - ray observations with the _ chandra _ observatory have found that some clusters have massive subhalos moving within the clusters which have not been disrupted @xcite .",
    "the contact surface between the cooler subhalo gas and the surrounding hot intracluster medium is called a `` cold front '' .",
    "the x - ray temperatures of these subhalos are @xmath10  kev , which is substantially higher that the kinetic temperatures one would derive from the motions of stars in the optical galaxies in the subhalos .",
    "the observations of these massive subhalos gives us important information about the massive end of the mdf .",
    "the plan of our paper is as follows . in  [",
    "sec : model ] , we derive the mdf in clusters analytically .",
    "we discuss the resulting mdfs and compare them with those from numerical simulations in  [ sec : mdf ] , we discuss the effect of tidal stripping and dynamical friction on the mdfs in  [ sec : tidal ] . in  [ sec : vdf ] , we derive the vdf of subhalos and compare these results with those of numerical simulations and observations of galaxies .",
    "we estimate the probability of finding massive x - ray subhalos and associated cold fronts in clusters in  [ sec : coldf ] .",
    "finally ,  [ sec : conc ] summarizes our conclusions .",
    "in this section , we derive the mdf of subhalos in a cluster including the effects of spatial correlations using the model of @xcite .",

    "however , we emphasize that the mdf ( equation  [ [ eq : yng ] ] ) includes the effect of the spatial correlation of fluctuations through the two - point correlation function ( equation  [ [ eq : two ] ] ) . moreover , it is the mdf in a high density region , rather than the mdf for an average region of the universe . as will shown in the next section , our model is a further extension of the eps mdf by taking account of spatial correlations of halos .",
    "thus , we refer to this mdf as sps mdf .",
    "we assume that the region of the mass scale of @xmath58 will collapse into a cluster and the subhalos in the region also fall into the cluster .",
    "the density fluctuations in the cluster region should stop growing as the cluster grows , because the kinetic energy released at the cluster collapse allows the subhalos to move in the cluster , which prevents their further growth .",
    "we call the redshift when this occurs the effective formation redshift of the cluster , @xmath61 .",

    "thus , we need an additional condition . however , @xcite showed that the effect is negligible as long as we consider a fluctuation power spectrum with an index of @xmath65 and the mass scale with @xmath66 . our calculations in the following sections satisfy these conditions .",

    "the change of the mdf slope of the simulated subhalos at @xmath141 seems to be caused by incompleteness due to limited resolution .",
    "the formation redshift , @xmath61 , is reasonable because the cluster in @xcite does not undergo major mergers since @xmath142 and the virial mass increases only by @xmath143% since that epoch .",

    "thus , the mdf is `` frozen in time '' since @xmath142 , and @xmath61 should be @xmath144 . note that since the comparison was done within the same physical volume , the accretion of halos from outside cluster does not affect the evolution of the mdf .",
    "simulation of clusters that collapse more recently ( @xmath145 ) would be useful to confirm whether @xmath67 is actually superior to @xmath93 and @xmath110 , because the three mdfs are more disparate at smaller @xmath61 ( figure  [ fig : nm ] ) .",
    "moreover , a recently formed cluster , the effects we have not considered ( e.g. , tidal stripping in the cluster ) would not have much time to operate .",

    "the result of @xcite at @xmath3 is also shown in figure  [ fig : nmo ] .",
    "as can be seen , @xmath67 at @xmath152 is consistent with the mdf of subhalos obtained by @xcite .",
    "in fact , they indicated that the mdf does not evolve significantly from @xmath4 to the present ; this cluster seems to have formed earlier than that in @xcite .",
    "okamoto & habe argue that the reason why the mdf in their simulated cluster agrees better with @xmath110 than with @xmath93 at @xmath152 may be because of their halo - finding algorithm .",
    "however , our results suggest this difference may be because @xmath93 does not include the effect of spatial correlations of fluctuations and because @xmath110 is almost the same as @xmath153 at @xmath152 ( figure  [ fig : nmo ] ) .",
    "we should note that we do not consider some mechanisms that could change the mdf of subhalos in a cluster after the cluster formation ; these mechanisms might have been effective even in cluster progenitors .",
    "first , tidal stripping reduces the mass of subhalos .",
    "we assume that the density profiles of subhalos and the main cluster are represented by the so - called nfw profile : @xmath154 where @xmath155 and @xmath107 are the characteristic radius and density of the halo , respectively @xcite .",

    "tidal stripping can occur by resonances between the force the subhalo exerts on the dark matter particle and the tidal force by the main cluster . in this case",
    ", the tidal radius can be obtained by solving the following equation for the tidal radius : @xmath176 which is equivalent to @xmath177 @xcite .",
    "we take the smaller of the two estimates of @xmath165 .    figure  [ fig : tidal ] shows the mass fraction of a subhalo within the tidal radius as a function of the ` subhalo ' virial mass @xmath178 .",
    "the cosmological and cluster parameters are the same as those in figure  [ fig : nm ] .",
    "as can be seen , tidal stripping is very effective when the distance from the cluster center is small .",
    "moreover , it is effective when @xmath159 is large , because the concentration parameter @xmath161 is small ( equation  [ [ eq : conc ] ] ) . in a real cluster ,",
    "the effect of tidal stripping depends on the orbit of a subhalo in a cluster .",
    "since it is difficult to discuss the orbits of subhalos analytically , numerical simulations are required to estimate the effect of tidal stripping on entire subhalos in a cluster quantitatively .",
    "@xcite estimated that for a circular velocity larger than @xmath179 ( @xmath180 ) , the masses of subhalos are smaller than those of isolated halos by @xmath181% on the average due to tidal stripping .",
    "thus , the tidal stripping would affect the comparison between our numerical model and the results of numerical simulations done in  [ sec : mdf ] , especially for the high mass end of the mdfs .",
    "second , the most massive subhalos often merge with the central `` cd galaxy '' via dynamical friction .",
    "thus , we may overestimate the number of these subhalos .",
    "the time - scale of dynamical friction can be estimated by using chandrasekhar s formula .",
    "when the density distribution of a cluster is approximated by an isothermal density distribution , a subhalo with the initial position of @xmath168 reaches the cluster center in the time of @xmath182^{-1}\\ ; , \\label{eq : fric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath183 $ ] , and @xmath105 is the cluster radius @xcite . note that the time - scale ( equation [ [ eq : fric ] ] ) is not much different from the one obtained by @xcite without the approximation of an isothermal distribution .",
    "figure  [ fig : fric ] shows the time - scale of dynamical friction @xmath184 as a function of the subhalo virial mass . the cosmological and cluster parameters are the same as those in figure  [ fig : nm ] .",
    "massive subhalos near the cluster center are most affected by dynamical friction .",
    "the fraction of subhalos that fall into the cluster center depends on the distribution of their orbits . in the numerical simulations done by @xcite ,",
    "60% of subhalos with the circular velocity of @xmath185 ( @xmath186 ) have merged into the central cd galaxy since @xmath187 , although the mergers have been less effective after @xmath188 .",
    "thus , the mdfs derived in  [ sec : mdf ] should be compared with the results of numerical simulations and observations with caution for those massive subhalos .    on the other hand , the distribution of peak circular velocities @xmath189 is less affected by tidal stripping , because the removal of the outer parts of a subhalo does not affect @xmath167 very strongly .",
    "@xcite showed that even if @xmath190% of the initial mass of a subhalo is removed by tidal stripping , @xmath167 changes only by @xmath191% . since the numerical simulations done by @xcite showed that tidal stripping reduces the mass of massive subhalos at most by @xmath192% , the tidal stripping may not affect the distribution function of values of @xmath167 ( vdf ) for subhalos significantly .",
    "thus , in the next section , we investigate the vdf for subhalos , although the high - velocity end of the vdf may still be affected by dynamical friction , or mergers of subhalos .",
    "observationally , @xmath167 can be obtained more easily than @xmath21 through the velocity dispersion of stars or the rotation curve of a galaxy .",
    "thus , the vdf is more useful for comparison with observations than the mdf .",
    "in order to derive the vdf of subhalos from the mdf , we need the relation between the velocity and mass . since there is no simple analytically derived relation , we use the relation derived by numerical calculations for isolated halos .",

    "@xmath67 at @xmath198 is consistent the result of numerical calculation as was shown to be the case for the mdf .",
    "this may mean that tidal stripping does not significantly affect the mdf of subhalos in the simulated cluster .",
    "the deviation of the simulated cluster data from the model at @xmath199 is caused by finite numerical resolution .",
    "the slope of the vdf in the simulated cluster is a little steeper than that of @xmath67 for @xmath200 if we remove the largest @xmath167 point .",
    "this may be caused by mergers of massive subhalos with the central cd galaxy .",
    "if the vdf is not significantly influenced by tidal stripping , we can use it to derive the effective formation redshift of a cluster .",
    "figure  [ fig : virgo ] shows the observed cumulative number of subhalos in the virgo cluster derived from galaxy data @xcite and the integrated @xmath67 for various @xmath61 .",
    "the cosmological parameters for @xmath67 are the same as those in @xcite .",
    "the comparison suggests that @xmath152 , although the slope of the virgo data does not match that of @xmath153 for @xmath201 . here , @xmath170 is the peak velocity @xmath167 of the rotation curve for applicable to the total mass of the cluster .",
    "the deviation for low @xmath167 subhalos may be because the corresponding galaxies are too faint to be detected .",
    "note that that the derived formation redshift , @xmath152 , is the redshift at which the growth of subhalos stopped .",
    "this corresponds to the time when the potential wells of the cluster progenitors , in which the subhalos were located , became sufficiently deep , even if the progenitors had not yet merged into one cluster .",
    "since the subhalos stopped growing , the formation of galaxies in them is also expected to decrease for @xmath202 . in the irregular virgo cluster , @xmath61 may correspond to the time at which the oldest galaxies were formed , even though the cluster itself is still merging at present .",
    "we note that we can not rule out the possibility that @xmath61 is somewhat smaller than 2 because of the ambiguity of the number and circular velocity of massive subhalos . in general , for massive subhalos , dynamical friction may cause them to merge into one large ( cd ) galaxy , which reduces their number .",
    "however , although there is a moderately large galaxy ( m87 ) at the center of the virgo cluster , it is not usually classified as a cd galaxy and is probably not the most luminous galaxy in the cluster .",
    "alternatively , the circular velocity of the galaxy residing in a massive subhalo may not represent that of the massive subhalo ; the former may be smaller than the latter .",
    "in fact , @xcite showed that the temperature of diffuse x - ray gas is systematically higher than that of kinetic temperature of stars for bright elliptical galaxies .",
    "if the temperature of the x - ray gas is considered to represent the depth of potential well of the halo around the elliptical galaxy , it shows the inconsistency of circular velocity between galaxies and subhalos .",
    "moreover , @xcite showed that bright elliptical galaxies with extend x - ray emission tend to have high x - ray temperature compared to those with compact x - ray emission for a given stellar velocity dispersion . on the other hand ,",
    "the x - ray gas may be affected by other heating processes ( e.g. , supernovae ) .",
    "these results suggest the existence of very large , massive subhalos whose x - ray temperature is much higher than kinetic temperature of the stars in the galaxies located in them .",
    "recent _ chandra _ observations have revealed the presence of such massive subhalos in clusters ; most of them are moving with the mach number of @xmath203 in clusters without losing their identity .",
    "thus , in the next section , we discuss the relation between the large x - ray subhalos and vdf .",
    "large x - ray subhalos are found in some clusters as low temperature x - ray components with cold fronts @xcite . the cold fronts are contact interfaces between the cooler gas in the subhalo and the hotter intracluster medium in the main cluster .",
    "the ratio of x - ray temperature of the subhalos to that of their host clusters is about @xmath204 .",
    "thus , if the x - ray temperature is proportional to @xmath205 , the corresponding velocity ratio is @xmath206 .",
    "@xcite suggested that a cluster with a large subhalo may be the result of the collapse of two different perturbations in the primordial density field on two different linear scales at nearly the same location in space .",
    "as the density field evolves , both perturbations start to collapse .",
    "the small - scale perturbation collapses first and forms a large subhalo , and then the larger perturbation collapses and forms a cluster .",
    "if the initial position of the subhalo was only slightly offset from the center of the cluster , it would infall into the cluster center with small velocity and oscillate around the cluster center .",
    "this would prevent the cool gas in the subhalo from being removed by ram - pressure stripping or the kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "we note that @xcite showed that the observed subhalos with cold fronts are stable for @xmath207  gyr against large - scale kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to estimate the probability of finding such large subhalos near centers of clusters , and to compare this probability with the observed rate of occurrence of cold fronts .",
    "if we had enough observational data about the massive subhalos , these could be used to study the validity of our mdf or vdf model . however , at present the number of clusters in which large x - ray subhalos are found is too small to allow a detailed discussion of the rate of occurrence of cold fronts .",
    "thus , in this study , we just predict the nature of the massive subhalos , assuming that our model is correct .",
    "the cumulative number of the most massive halos is larger for smaller @xmath61 ( figure  [ fig : virgo ] ) , because hierarchical clustering proceeds furthest .",
    "thus , we use @xmath67 at @xmath109 to estimate the maximum probability of finding those subhalos .",
    "figure  [ fig : virgo ] shows that the cumulative number , @xmath208 , is about 0.3 , which means that at most one third of clusters should have large subhalos , some of which may have cold fronts similar to the observed ones . in order to find the initial position of the subhalos in a precluster region",
    ", we calculate the number by changing the radius , @xmath168 , within which the conditional probability ( equation [ [ eq : prob ] ] ) is averaged .",
    "figure  [ fig : rad ] shows the result for the same cluster in figure  [ fig : virgo ] . since @xmath209 is almost constant for @xmath210 , it is most likely that the initial position of the subhalo is @xmath211 . because we do not consider the spatial distribution of mass in a precluster region and the detailed evolution of cluster collapse",
    ", we can not exactly predict the infall or oscillating velocity of the subhalo in a cluster .",
    "however , if the initial position of the subhalo is well inside the precluster region , the infall or oscillating velocity may be subsonic or at most transonic , which may be consistent with the observations @xcite .",
    "note that if the initial position of a subhalo is near @xmath212 , the mach number of the infall velocity should be @xmath213 @xcite .",
    "the above result suggests that most of the x - ray substructures in clusters have not fallen in from large distances , as would be true for cluster mergers . instead",
    ", most of the cold fronts may be due to internal subhalos .",
    "the fact that clusters having subhalos moving with highly supersonic velocities ( e.g. 1e0657@xmath21456 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are rarely found may support this idea , although the number of clusters for which the velocities of subhalos are derived is small .    as is mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : tidal ] , the large subhalos should be affected by dynamical friction ( @xmath215 according to @xcite ) . in approximately the time shown in equation  ( [ eq : fric ] ) the subhalos reaches the cluster center .",
    "if the subhalos are not completely disrupted before they reach the cluster center , the clusters should have a potential well with two different spatial scales .",
    "in fact , @xcite found a double dark halo distribution in the fornax cluster . on the other hand , in the central regions of many clusters ,",
    "cool gas is observed @xcite .",
    "these subhalos may provide cool gas into the cluster center .",
    "we have constructed a model of the mass distribution function ( mdf ) of subhalos in clusters , including the fact that the subhalos grew from spatially correlated density fluctuations in high - density regions . if a cluster forms at a low redshift , the derived mass distribution function of subhalos is intermediate between the press - schechter mass distribution function and a conditional mass distribution function derived by an extension of the ps formalism . however , if a cluster forms at high redshift , our subhalo mdf is nearly identical to these other mdfs for low mass subhalos .",
    "the velocity distribution functions show similar trends .",
    "we compare our model mdf with the results of @xmath0-body numerical simulations .",
    "we find that they are consistent with each other .",
    "the comparison of our model with the subhalo population derived from galaxy data suggests that the subhalos in virgo cluster stopped growing at @xmath216 .",
    "our model predicts that at most 1/3 of clusters should have large x - ray subhalos like the ones observed as cold fronts with _",
    "chandra_. many of the observed x - ray substructures in clusters may not be the result of cluster mergers ; instead , they may be due to internal substructures within the clusters .",
