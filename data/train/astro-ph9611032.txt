    "the cmb radiation in a wide frequency range has a planck  spectrum with @xmath2 ( fixsen et al .",
    "the last dramatic event that could have influenced a part of the spectrum was the recombination of the primeval hydrogen , since after it the residual ionization was very low and the radiation fields practically do nt interact with the non - relativistic matter any more . the properties of the post ",
    "recombination universe can be studied by observing the microwave background radiation .",
    "the fluctuations in the cmb are supposed to be the precursors of the largest structures observed today .    to understand the nature of the microwave background anisotropies it is necessary to have a correct picture of the recombination process itself .",
    "the problem was first studied shortly after the discovery of the cmb by peebles ( 1968 ) and at the same time by zeldovich , kurt and sunyaev ( 1968 ) . since than several authors have adressed the problem , but no one could improve on the basic approximations used in these works .",
    "however many details were worked out .",
    "matsuda , sato & takeda ( 1971 ) examined the effects of the collision processes and found that they are negligible with respect to the radiation processes .",
    "jones & wyse ( 1985 ) improved on the calculations to allow for the presence of non  baryonic matter .",
    "krolik ( 1989 , 1990 ) showed that two previously equally neglected scattering effects in the ly@xmath3 line almost completely cancel each other .",
    "sasaki & takahara ( 1993 ) concluded that taking induced recombination into account changes the time history of the recombination at very low ionization grades , and lowers the residual ionization .",
    "they however used an approximation for the recombination cross sections and did not discuss the divergence of the sum of the recombination rates .",
    "dellantonio & rybicki ( 1993 ) followed the progress of recombination numerically , using a multilevel hydrogen atom model ; all angular momentum states were treated individually up to @xmath4 .",
    "their recombination curve was similiar to that of jones & wyse ( 1985 ) .",
    "in an other article rybicki & dellantonio ( 1994 ) calculated the time - dependence of the ly@xmath5 line profile in a homogenious expanding universe .",
    "they found that the usual quasi - static approximation for the line shape is reasonable and does not cause substantial error in the solutions .",
    "they also determined the recombination history for several cosmologies .",
    "hu , scott , sugiyama & white ( 1995 ) discussed the effect of physical assumptions for cmb anisotropies and on the recombination process .",
    "recombination , as it has been pointed out in the papers quoted above , sets in when all energy levels of hydrogen , except for the ground state are still in equilibrium with radiation .",
    "when one hydrogen atom enters the ground state , a photon with energy greater than or equal to the energy of a @xmath6 transition is emitted .",
    "photons , capable of exciting electrons in the ground state , are lost via two main routes : 1 . by cosmological",
    "redshift of @xmath6 photons , 2 . by two ",
    "photon transition @xmath7 .",
    "of these two competing processes the first is purely cosmological , the second is atomic .",
    "their relative importance depends on the cosmology .    by theoretical examination of the recombination process one",
    "computes the time dependence of the ionization rate , the residual ionization , the position and width of the last scattering layer and the distortion of the cmb spectrum .",
    "though the amount of the residual ionization is important for the further evolution of the universe ( peebles 1993 , lepp & shull 1984 ) , it can not be measured directly .",
    "a possible observable consequence of the hydrogen recombination in the early universe is the distortion of the microwave background radiation spectrum .",
    "it was first calculated for the flat cosmological model by peebles ( 1968 ) . in this work",
    "we concentrate on the determination of this distortion for different cosmological models .",
    "recently there has been a considerable observational and theoretical activity to determine the spectrum of the cosmic background radiation and carrying out galaxy counts in the far infrared / submillimeter range ( puget et al .",
    "1996 , schlegel et al .",
    "1997 , guideroni et al .",
    "1997 ) . because the hydrogen recombination changes the cbm spectrum in the same spectral range a detailed exact recalculation of the frequency distribution of the recombination photons is important . in this paper",
    "we calculate the recombination cross sections exactly by using a continuous , physical cut off for the highly excited states of hydrogen , take into account the induced recombination and explain , why the time dependence of the recombination process is so hardly effected by different techniques and by different effective ionization curves .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  2 we discuss the recombination process and derive the recombination equation .",
    "we give a new parametrization of the effective recombination coefficients , taking into account the induced recombination as well . in the third section",
    "we solve the recombination equation .",
    "the spectrum of the recombination photons and its dependence on the cosmological parameters is given in the fourth  , and in the fifth closing section we discuss our results .",
    "the number of recombinations in unit time can be calculated from the recombination equation as a function of the density of free electrons @xmath8 , temperature @xmath9 , and cosmological , and atomic constants . in this section",
    "we derive this equation following peebles ( 1968 ) .    at the beginning of the hydrogen recombination",
    "the helium is already completely recombined .",
    "the mass fraction of the helium is 25 % of the total baryonic mass . as was remarked by novikov and zeldovich ( 1967 ) the direct recombinations to the ground state",
    "are inhibited , while the new born energetic photons ionize again almost immediately when there are already some hydrogen atoms . in the following we neglect completely the direct recombinations to the ground state .",
    "the states with principal quantum number @xmath10 play a key role in the recombination processes .",
    "first we calculate the rate of recombinations to @xmath11 for given free electron number density @xmath12 , temperature t and @xmath13 . here",
    "@xmath14 is the density of atoms in the state with the principal quantum number @xmath15 and angular momentum quantum number @xmath16 .",
    "second , we determine the net number of @xmath17 transitions in unit time by given @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the two rates must be equal , so we can eliminate @xmath13 from the calculations .",
    "the binding energy of the @xmath10 state is b@xmath20 . during the recombination process",
    "there are a large number of photons with energy less than @xmath21 , therefore the excited states of the hydrogen atoms are in thermodynamical equilibrium above the second level , i.e. @xmath22 in the case of gaseous nebulae the mean free path of low energetic photons is larger than the dimensions of the ionized region , the system is far from being in equilibrium above the @xmath23 level in contrast to the recombining universe .",
    "the partition sum @xmath24 is divergent .",
    "as analysed by hummer and mihalas ( 1988 ) a number of effects limit the range of summation . in the considered",
    "temperature and density range the action of free protons turns out to be the most important , the action of neutral atoms are much smaller .",

    "this means that the recombined electrons become unbound with @xmath31 probability , before they would begin to move towards the state , corresponding to thermal equilibrium .",
    "the highly excited ( @xmath15 larger than @xmath32 ) states are practically completely destroyed .",
    "the occupation numbers of the excited states in thermal equilibrium are : @xmath33 owing to this fact , the number of electrons in bound states is finite , and thermal equilibrium between the @xmath34 bound states and the continuum is possible .",
    "this approximation is good down to z @xmath35 300 .",
    "the @xmath10 levels freeze out between the redshifts 300 and 250 .",
    "the ground state of the hydrogen atom is about 10.2 ev deeper than the @xmath36 level .",
    "consequently , it s occupation is greater than the occupation of the excited states together : @xmath37 .",
    "this means , that the density of free electrons plus the density of hydrogen atoms in ground state can be taken as equal to the total proton number : @xmath38 .",
    "the total baryon number ( determined by @xmath39 ) is the sum of p and the number of baryons in the helium nuclei .      the number of recombinations to the level @xmath40 and the number of ionizations from @xmath40 in unit time are @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the recombination and ionization coefficients , @xmath44 is the density of free protons .",
    "the usual definition of these quantities are @xmath45 here @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the velocities .",
    "the averages must be taken over the maxwell ",
    "distribution for electrons and the planck  distribution for photons .",
    "the ionization coefficients are : @xmath48 the relation between the recombination and ionization cross sections is : @xmath49 , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are the photon and electron momenta .    by using , instead of the electron velocity , the energy of the recombination photon in the maxwell  distribution and expressing the recombination cross section through the ionization cross section , one arrives at @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the electron mass .",
    "the integrals in @xmath54 and @xmath55 are not the same .",
    "but , due to the principle of detailed balance ( milne 1924 ) the recombinations and ionizations in thermodynamic equilibrium must exactly cancel each other .",
    "if we let contributions from the induced recombinations modify the recombination coefficients ( e.g. mihalas 1984 , sasaki & takahara 1993 ) instead of ( [ rcoefo ] ) we get @xmath56 the term @xmath57 under the integral in the denominator comes from the induced recombinations . without it the principle of detailed balance would not be fulfilled .",
    "summing up over all @xmath58 levels and making use of equation ( [ nnl ] ) the total rate of recombinations is : @xmath59 the total rate of ionizations from the excited states of hydrogen is : @xmath60 the net number of recombinations to excited levels in unit time and unit volume is the difference of these two expressions . the number density of the electrons changes , not only because of the recombination process , but also in consequence to the universal expansion .",
    "the simplest way to take this effect into account is to write on equation for the ionization rate , i.e.  the ratio of free electrons to the number of free protons plus hydrogen atoms : @xmath61.\\ ] ]      each @xmath63 transition liberates a @xmath64 photon , which can excite the ground state , and there are always enough low energy photons to ionize from an excited state .",
    "the transition to the ground state is final , when the number of these @xmath65 photons is also diminished .",
    "photons can escape from the @xmath64 line either by redshift or by two ",
    "photon 2s @xmath66 1s transitions .    in a stationary state",
    "the numbers of emitted and absorbed @xmath67 photons are equal .",
    "consequently , the number of photons per mode in the @xmath64 resonance line is : @xmath68 because of the general expansion of the universe a frequency @xmath69 is shifted in unit time by @xmath70 where h is the hubble ",
    "the number of recombination photons removed from the line by redshift in unit time is : @xmath71    on the other hand , the rate of two  photon decay in the 2s states has been calculated by spitzer & greenstein ( 1951 ) .",

    "we need the recombination coefficient @xmath82 , wich is parametrized as a function of the temperature in several ways .",
    "peebles ( 1968 ) used @xmath83 on the basis of boardman s ( 1964 ) data for the seven lowest states .",
    "zeldovich , kurt and sunyaev ( 1968 ) used @xmath84 .",
    "peebles ( 1993 ) using osterbrock s ( 1989 ) data got the parametrization : @xmath85 . recently hummer ( 1994 ) tabulated very accurately the recombination rates .",
    "his results confirm the parametrization given by pquignot et al .",
    "( 1991 ) in the form of @xmath86 sasaki & takahara ( 1993 ) had used the asymptotic form for the recombination cross sections which , also valid for large principal quantum numbers @xmath15 , was less than 20% accurate for the important low lying levels .",
    "when calculating the recombination coefficients without taking into account the induced recombination , the @xmath87 falls out of the denominator of the integral in ( [ rcoef ] ) . in this case",
    "the @xmath88 series converges as @xmath89 , so one can neglect the contribution of the terms with large @xmath15 .",
    "if induced recombination is taken into account , the denominator under the integral in ( [ rcoef ] ) goes to zero for large @xmath15 , and the series of the @xmath90 diverges as @xmath91 .    here we calculate the total recombination coefficient from ( [ recr ] ) , wherein the factor @xmath92 , the probability that the states with principal quantum number @xmath15 are not destroyed , makes the sum finite . the probability that a state is destroyed depends on the baryon density of the universe .",
    "consequently , the effective recombination coefficient also density dependent .",
    "our procedure is then the following .",
    "we calculate the first several hundred @xmath42 s using the exact results given by storey & hummer ( 1991 ) . for large @xmath15 ( @xmath93 ) , when the recombination coefficients have already reach their asymptotic values ( the difference between the exact and asymptotic value @xmath94 )",
    ", we use the @xmath95 s given e.g.in rybicki & lightman ( 1979 ) .",
    "the density dependence comes in through the @xmath96 probabilities .",

    "however this dependence is mild , not larger than 10 % for the usual range of parameters .",
    "we compute the @xmath101 function together with @xmath12 by solving ( [ receq ] ) .",
    "the solution of this equation for n@xmath29 and @xmath102 will be given in the next section .",
    "for the sake of clarity we present our recombination rate already here ( fig .",
    "the form of the @xmath103 function is not far from the usual @xmath104 function , but its amplitude is about four times larger than it would be without taking the induced recombination into account .",
    "furthermore we compare our @xmath105 with ( [ alpeq ] ) , and with sasaki & takahara ( 1993 ) , whereby our function is somewhat steeper than that of these authors .",

    "burgess ( 1958 ) used this method to compute the recombination spectrum in nebulae . in the case of nebulae this method gives good results , because there is no thermal equilibrium above the n = 2 states , the electrons recombine on the low lying states and cascade down .",
    "background photons stimulate recombination processes and that give an important contribution to the effective recombination coefficient .",
    "the resulting recombination coefficient is about a factor of four larger than calculated without the induced recombinations ( figure 1 ) and depends , besides the temperature , on the free electron ( proton ) density as well .",
    "in contrast to the recombining universe in a gaseous nebulae with the same temperature and free electron density the recombination coefficient is given by ( [ alpeq ] ) , because there are no photons that should stimulate recombination on excited states .",

    "there is a peak around @xmath203 and @xmath202 vanishes when @xmath16 is high .",
    "transitions between states with high @xmath16 s are slow , which could influence the relative occupation of s and p states . since this last effect is probably small ( see hu et al .",
    "1995 ) , we have completely neglected it here .",
    "in the main part of the recombination process the free  bound transitions are more rapid than the depopulation of the @xmath36 state and the thermodynamic equilibrium is maintained by reionization .",
    "consequently , the course of the recombination process does not depend on the details of the @xmath204 function .",
    "because of that , authors , using quite different effective recombination coefficients , come up with similiar time dependence for recombination .",
    "when , however , the free electron density is already low , the depopulation of the @xmath36 states is more rapid than the recombinations of the @xmath205 states and the speed of the recombination process is determined by the free  bound transitions of the excited states and the induced recombinations are important . as a consequence ,",
    "our ionization curve ( figure 2 ) is for small ionization grades steeper than that of dellantonio & rybicki ( 1993 ) , who did not take this effect into account .",
    "the last scattering of the cmb photons happens , with high probability , in the first phase of the recombination , when the number of free  bound transitions to the excited states is large .",
    "the induced recombinations and the numerical value of the effective recombination coefficient do not influence the position of the last scattering layer .",
    "our results agree with those of white , scott & silk ( 1994 ) .    on the other hand",
    "the residual ionization is a quantity determined by the details of the recombinations of the excited states at low n@xmath29 . at @xmath206 ,",
    "whether induced recombination is taken into account or not , the fractional ionization is proportional to @xmath207 . however , because of the induced recombinations , the residual ionization is reduced by a factor of about 2.6 .",
    "the exact value of this factor depends on the cosmological parameters .",
    "a consequence of the low residual ionization and the higher number of photons in the tail of the cmb spectrum is that the final abundance of molecular hydrogen will be much smaller than that estimated by lepp & shull ( 1983 ) .",
    "the hydrogen recombination gives contribution to the cmb spectrum in the @xmath208 190 @xmath200 m range .",
    "the amplitude and form of this distortion depends on the number of photons issuing from the recombination , and their distribution between the two decay way , the @xmath7 two  photon mode and the redshifted ly@xmath5 mode .",
    "the induced recombinations only in the last phase influence the recombination process , when the ionization grade already very low .",
    "this gives a very small contribution to the distortion of the spectrum .",
    "the contribution of helium recombination to the photon spectrum was discussed by lyubarsky & sunyaev ( 1983 ) and by fahr & loch ( 1991 ) . according to their results the recombination of he sets in at a redshift of about four times larger than that for hydrogen recombination .",
    "but the photon energy is also four times larger and the photons emerging from helium recombination could also distort the cmb spectrum in the same frequency range as the h  recombination .",
    "however , as it was pointed out by peebles ( 1995 ) , at those redshifts where he ii recombines there is already a trace of recombined hydrogen , which can absorb some of the photons created during helium recombination .",
    "thus direct recombination into the ground state is possible for helium and the saha formula is a good approximation to describe the helium recombination history .",
    "the optical depth due to ionization between z@xmath209 and z@xmath210 is @xmath211 the redshift of the helium recombination is z@xmath209 , the cross section for hydrogen ionization is @xmath212 , and the number density of hydrogen atoms , as computed from the saha formula , is n@xmath213 .",
    "the distance to the radiation source at the moment of emission , r(z@xmath209 ) , is calculated from the friedmann equation . the integral reaches 1 at about z@xmath214 .",
    "consequently , in contrast to the results mentioned above , helium recombination does not leave any trace on the cmb spectrum .    as is discussed in hu et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , the difference between the temperature of the photons and the kinetic temperature of the electrons has an effect below z @xmath215 200 .",
    "we follow the recombination process only down to z = 220 , so this effect is neglected .",
    "the possible @xmath216 and the @xmath217 two  photon transitions could also have some importance .",
    "the number of bound electrons in the @xmath218 states is of the same order of magnitude that for n@xmath219 .",
    "the two  photon decay probabilities for these states are smaller than for @xmath13 .",
    "moreover some of these photons will have more energy than b@xmath210 ",
    "b@xmath209 = 10.2 ev .",
    "however , the contribution of these transitions is not entirely negligible , they can change the balance between the two routes , redshift and two  photon decay , for the elimination of energetic photons and change the spectrum of the recombination photons .",
    "this correction will be discussed in detail elsewhere .    if there were some energy input prior to the hydrogen recombination and a `` y - distortion '' of the spectrum ( zeldovich & sunyaev 1969 ) it would be easier to observe the consequences of h  recombination ( lyubarsky & sunyaev 1983 ) .",
    "however , the observations permit a very low upper limit for the y - distortion ( mather et al .  1994 ,",
    "fixsen et al .  1996 ) .",
    "the distortion seems to occur at wavelengths where other sources give considerable contributions . by doing the calculations we had hoped that the zodiacal forground emission , the dust and molecular emission from the interstellar medium would be reliably modeled , subtracted and the calculated spectral distortion would be measurable .",
    "recently that substraction has been done ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1997 ) and it turned out that in the considered wavelength range the measured upper limit of the background is at least two order of magnitude higher as the spectrum calculated here . as it was pointed out by guideroni et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , it could originate from early starlight scattered by dust .",
