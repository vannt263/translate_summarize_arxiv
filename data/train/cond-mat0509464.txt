    "colloids are microscopic particles suspended in liquid . generally , they are on the order of micrometers in size , and thus they are much larger than molecules , but still small enough to exhibit brownian motion .",
    "colloids are convenient to study experimentally because unlike molecules , they can be easily observed with ordinary microscopes . in recent years , as the technology used in their manipulation has developed , experimental studies of colloids have advanced greatly @xcite .    in colloidal many - body systems , melting , freezing , glass transitions and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics have been studied . among studies of nonequilibrium steady states",
    "( nesss ) , dzubeilla et al . investigated a model that describes two fixed colloidal particles ( test particles ) in an environment containing many driven particles ( background particles ) .",
    "they reported that in a ness , the effective interaction forces they defined between the two fixed particles violate the law of action and reaction @xcite .",
    "this result implies that an effective potential seems not to be constructed in ness .    the effective interaction force defined in ref . [ 7 ] represents the two - body effect of the total force exerted by the background particles , which is extracted by subtracting from it the total force in the case that there is only colloidal particle .",
    "although their definition seems plausible because of its simplicity , we expect that there is room to define a different type of effective force in ness . with this motivation , we attempt to provide another idea for an effective interaction force between the two fixed particles .    in this paper , we reconsider effective forces in nesss by studying a system similar to that used in ref @xcite .",
    "first , we review the concept of effective forces in equilibrium from three points of view , statistical mechanics , mechanics , and thermodynamics .",
    "next , we investigate effective forces for nonequilibrium systems by considering the results of numerical experiments . particularly , we demonstrate that in the ness we consider , the law of action and reaction holds for the effective force defined according to a conjectured thermodynamic relation applied to nesss .",
    "the model we study describes a system in which two test particles are trapped side by side in the center of the system by a harmonic potential and @xmath0 background particles are driven by an external force ( see fig .",

    "the test particles are unaffected by the driving force , and the background particles are unaffected by the trapping potential .",

    "then , letting @xmath5 and @xmath6 be the positions of particle * 1 * and particle * 2 * , we consider particle * 2 * fixed for simplicity , with particle * 1 * trapped by the harmonic potential @xmath7 where @xmath8 corresponds to the center of the potential , and @xmath9 is a spring constant chosen to be sufficiently large that particle * 1 * can be regarded as almost fixed .",
    "it is important to note that , although it may seem simpler to fix particle * 1 * , the dynamical degrees of freedom of particle * 1 * must be taken into account when we consider the distribution function of the effective description in which the degrees of freedom of the background particles are integrated .",
    "[ if particle * 1 * is also fixed , no variable remains in the distribution function of the effective description ( see the next section ) ] . as a further simplification",
    ", it is assumed that there is no direct interaction between particles * 1 * and * 2 * and that there is no direct interaction among the background particles .",
