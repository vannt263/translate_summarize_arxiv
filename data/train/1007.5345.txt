    "such models have shown how the phase diagram varies with interaction strength and range , and have revealed the presence of kinetically - arrested gel- and glass states @xcite . while pairwise - additive ` screened '",
    "potentials capture much of the important physics of electrostatics , they neglect explicit counterion degrees of freedom . here",
    "we show that accounting for counterion entropies reveals that electrostatics does more than simply prevent association : it can induce a thermodynamic driving force that favors a gel over a crystal .",
    "we consider a collection of hard spheres ( macroions ) of radius @xmath0 in aqueous solution with added salt ( we set @xmath1 nm , appropriate for a small protein ) .",
    "spheres carry a point charge @xmath2 at their centers , and interact with square - well attractions of depth @xmath3 and range @xmath4 .",
    "we are interested in three phases : the solution phase of dissociated spheres , a close - packed three - dimensional crystal , and a kinetically - stabilized gel that we model as a one - dimensional rod of associated spheres .",
    "we describe a crystallization window that is bounded on one side by the thermodynamic stability of the crystal , and on the other by the appearance of the kinetically favored gel .",
    "we approximate the kinetic threshold for gelation as the regime in which the chemical potential of a linear aggregate drops below that of the solution ; since one - dimensional objects lack a nucleation barrier , we expect gelation to preempt crystallization in this regime .",
    "this threshold reproduces qualitatively the gelation boundaries determined from numerical and experimental studies of colloids and proteins  @xcite while allowing efficient computation of electrostatics .",
    "we write the chemical potentials of the zero- , one- and three - dimensional phases ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) as @xmath5 these expressions account for free energies of binding and electrostatic free energies @xmath6 associated with each @xmath7dimensional assembly ( @xmath8 refers to solution - phase monomers , @xmath9 refers to chain - like aggregates and @xmath10 describes the crystal phase ) .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath11 for the solution phase contains the carnahan - starling expression for the free energy of hard spheres as a function of @xmath12 , the volume fraction of spheres in solution  @xcite .",
    "the expression @xmath13 for the rod phase accounts for the fact that each particle makes two pairwise contacts of energy @xmath3 .",
    "it also contains an entropic term that accounts for the fact that a new particle can add to the end of a rod anywhere within a shell of volume @xmath14 around the existing end particle .",
    "this contribution accounts for both bending and vibrational entropies ( we neglect unimportant constant terms ) .",
    "we also neglect rod branching  @xcite , which at the level of electrostatics amounts to assuming the characteristic linear extent of a gel is long compared to the debye length .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath15 of the close - packed crystal accounts for the energetic contacts between each particle and its @xmath16 nearest neighbors ( we set @xmath17 ) , and the fact that each particle can vibrate a distance of order @xmath18 in each direction  @xcite .",
    "we set @xmath19 in our calculations , motivated by the recognition that proteins typically possess interactions of short range  @xcite .    to these expressions",
    "we add the electrostatic free energies @xmath6 of each @xmath20-dimensional assembly .",
    "we calculated these free energies using the poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) equation @xmath21 which we have written in terms of scaled spatial coordinates @xmath22 and a dimensionless potential @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath24 is the debye length , given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the concentration of ions in a reservoir of solvent in osmotic equilibrium with the system .",

    "( [ pb ] ) for given assembly geometry .",
    "to simplify the solution of the pb equation we approximated the rod as a smooth cylinder .",
    "for the crystal we used a cell model  @xcite .",
    "we have also considered a two - dimensional assembly to gain insight into the scaling behavior of the electrostatics , although we stress that one would need to consider an _",
    "anisotropic _ particle - particle interaction to stabilize such a structure ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the electrostatic calculations are presented in detail in the appendix .",
    "we then computed the electrostatic energy @xmath29 and entropy @xmath30 associated with each assembly .",
    "the energy @xmath29 stored in the electric field is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the permittivity of water ( @xmath33 is that of free space ) .",
    "the entropy @xmath30 quantifies the cost of confining counterions and excluding coions from the screening layer associated with a @xmath20-dimensional assembly  @xcite .",
    "the entropy cost per unit volume of maintaining a screening layer of ion concentration @xmath34 in thermal contact with a reservoir of ions at concentration @xmath26 is @xmath35 the electrostatic free energy can then be written @xmath36 , where the free energy density is @xmath37 note that the minimization of eq .",
    "[ free ] with respect to ionic concentration results in eq .",
    "[ pb ] @xcite .",
    "finally , to compute the electrostatic free energy cost of assembling spheres into each @xmath7dimensional structure , we computed the free energy per particle in the assembly , @xmath38 , and subtracted from this the electrostatic free energy of the monomeric building blocks in solution ( determined by solving the pb equation for an isolated sphere ) .",
    "the result is @xmath6 .",
    "fig .  [ fig1 ] shows the electrostatic free energy @xmath39 of a @xmath20-dimensional assembly , and its components , the electrostatic energy @xmath40 and entropy @xmath41 ( the case @xmath42 is included for comparison , but it will not appear in our phase diagram ) .",
    "we see that the energy per particle is non - monotonic in aggregate dimensionality : the energy change upon condensation from the free particle state to the crystalline state is _ negative _ , because the macroion - macroion repulsion is overcome by the attraction between macroions and the counterions confined within the crystal s cavities ( assumed to be small compared to the debye length ) . by contrast , the electrostatic entropy cost increases monotonically with aggregate dimensionality .",
    "furthermore , these entropies are much larger in magnitude than their energetic counterparts , and so the electrostatic free energy cost becomes larger as the structure increases in dimensionality .",
    "although it seems intuitively obvious that assembling charged spheres into a crystal should meet with an electrostatic free energy cost , it is not obvious , a priori , that the origin of this cost is entropic , and not energetic  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1 ] reveals that the electrostatic entropy alone is a reasonable approximation of the electrostatic free energy cost of assembly , a fact that has been long appreciated in polymeric systems @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the entropy with @xmath20 can be understood from the following simple argument .",
    "electroneutrality requires that @xmath2 counterions be confined near each macroion .",
    "counterions are free to extend a distance @xmath24 in each of the @xmath43 dimensions extending _ away _ from the assembly , but are confined within a distance of order the particle size @xmath0 in each of the @xmath20 dimensions _ of _ the assembly .",
    "thus the volume @xmath44 within which @xmath2 counterions must be localized scales as @xmath45 , and so the entropic cost per macroion of building the screening layer scales as @xmath46 , or @xmath47 this cost _ increases _ with @xmath20 .",
    "one immediate consequence of the fact that counterion entropies dominate the free energy cost for assembling charged particles is that effective macroion interactions are _ not _ in general pairwise - additive : the free energy difference @xmath6 depends on the volume of space accessible to counterions , but does not necessarily vary linearly with the number of contacts made by particles in each assembly",
    ". we can define @xmath48/2@xmath49 as a measure of the relative electrostatic cost of making a macroion - macroion contact in a gel versus a crystal .",
    "when @xmath50 is unity there is no difference in this cost , the electrostatic effects can be adsorbed into an effective pairwise interaction , such as a yukawa potential  @xcite .",
    "however , when @xmath51 the electrostatic free energy is _ non - additive _ , rendered so by counterion degrees of freedom .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we plot @xmath50 as a function of salt concentration @xmath26 and particle charge @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath50 is in general less than unity , indicating that it is easier , per macroion contact , to fit counterions around a gel than within a crystal .",
    "@xmath50 is also non - monotonic : in principle , at large salt concentration strong electrostatic screening will ensure that macroion sites are independent , with electrostatic free energies becoming pairwise - additive ( as seen in the plot , though , such concentrations can be unattainably high ) . at low salt concentration",
    "@xmath50 again approaches unity",
    ". this can be understood by considering eq .",
    "[ eq : scaling ] for a cubic packing arrangement . in this case",
    "@xmath20 is proportional to the number of nearest neighbors and each additional pair of neighbors reduces the volume accessible to the counterions by a factor @xmath52 .",
    "this results in an electrostatic free energy linear in the number of nearest neighbors . however , at finite salt concentration the volume occluded by the macroion ( neglected in eq .",
    "[ eq : scaling ] ) becomes a significant perturbation to @xmath44 , and the approximation of pairwise additivity fails .",
    "relative electrostatic cost of making a macroion - macroion contact in a gel versus a crystal , @xmath50 , as a function of salt concentration @xmath26 and macroion charge @xmath2 . only when @xmath50 is unity is the electrostatics of assembly effectively pairwise - additive , which in general is not the case . ]",
    "we turn now to calculation of the model s phase diagram .",
    "we found the solution - crystal coexistence line by setting @xmath53 , and estimated the nonequilibrium solution - gel coexistence line by setting @xmath54 .",
    "this line does not describe an equilibrium coexistence : what we mean by it is the location at which there exists a driving force for monomers to aggregate in a disordered way .",
    "the crystal may be thermodynamically stable , but at moderate degrees of supercooling or supersaturation it is separated from the solution phase by a free energy barrier , and may require considerable time to appear . by contrast , there exists no free energy barrier to the formation of a linear aggregate , and so we expect a gel to form readily below the nonequilibrium solution - gel coexistence line .    our phase diagram in the temperature - density plane",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , for fixed salt concentration and for two macroion charges .",
    "the close - packed crystal is stable below the gray solution - crystal coexistence lines , but we expect a driving force for gelation below the red solution - gel coexistence lines . this behavior is similar to that seen in simulations of spheres with short range attractions  @xcite . the resulting ` window ' of crystal stability and accessibility ( shaded region between the red and blue lines ) is narrow , and becomes narrower as macroion charge increases .",
    "this is a key finding of our study . as noted before , the reason for this narrowing is the increasing cost of confining counterions within a close - packed crystal relative to around an open gel .",
    "( a ) phase diagram in the temperature - density plane showing solution - gel ( red ) and crystal - solution ( gray ) coexistence lines , for macroion charges @xmath55 ( solid ) and @xmath56 ( dotted ) for salt concentration 0.1 m. as macroion charge increases the crystal can be rendered stable by decreasing temperature , _ but _ counterion entropy increasingly favors the gel over the crystal .",
    "the ` window ' ( shaded ) within which the crystal is stable _ and _ the solution is stable against gelation therefore shrinks as charge increases .",
    "( b ) phase diagram in the charge - salt concentration plane for two bond strengths @xmath57 . as charge increases , adding salt lessens the entropic difference between gel and crystal , widening the desired shaded region between the sol - gel and sol - crystal lines .",
    "note that this region narrows as bond strength increases . ]",
    "we have seen that there are two consequences of increasing macroion charge : the crystallization window narrows , and it shifts to smaller values of @xmath58 .",
    "this latter effect is useful for protein crystallization where we might not have the freedom to raise temperature ( lest it lead to denaturation ) : increasing protein charge might be one way to move the crystallization window into the region of @xmath58 accessible exprimentally .",
    "the tradeoff is that adding charge causes the window to narrow , but this can be counteracted by adding salt .",
    "[ fig3](b ) shows how , for two fixed bond strengths @xmath57 , one can alter charge and salt concentration to widen the crystallization window .",
    "note that this window narrows as bond strength increases .",
    "the shrinking of the crystallization window with the bond strength can be understood by writing the net interaction between the particles in terms of the attractive and repulsive components @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the electrostatic _ repulsion _ energy per crystal contact . in terms of these variables",
    "we can express the solution - crystal coexistence line , given by @xmath53 , as @xmath61 similarly , we can express the solution - gel coexistence line as @xmath62 where we have used @xmath50 to write the electrostatic free energy of the gel in terms of @xmath63",
    ".     phase diagram showing the lines @xmath54 ( dotted ) and @xmath53 ( solid ) as a function of the attractive and repulsive contributions to the net interaction ( here @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) . ]    eqs .",
    "[ eq : spdxtal ] and [ eq : spdgel ] are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : spd ] .",
    "we see that strongly attractive particles ( large @xmath66 ) can be brought within the crystallization window by increasing @xmath63 .",
    "however , this window becomes narrower with increasing @xmath66 , and above a critical attraction vanishes entirely .",
    "this happens because strongly attractive particles require large charges to weaken particle - particle interactions enough to destabilize the gel , but large charges in turn recruit dense screening layers which act to favor the gel over the crystal .",
    "this effect can be mitigated by working under conditions for which electrostatic interactions are approximately pairwise - additive ( large @xmath50 ) .",
    "increasing the value of @xmath50 decreases the slope of the solution - gel coexistence line ( dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fig : spd ] ) .",
    "this widens the crystallization window and increases the critical value of @xmath66 at which the solution - gel line overtakes the solution - crystal line . in practice",
    ", @xmath50 can be increased by simultaneously increasing salt concentration and particle charge .",
    "for example , within our model system a macroion charge @xmath67 in 100 mm salt , or a charge of @xmath68 in 800 mm salt , both destabilize crystal bonds by @xmath69 . however , the former condition destabilizes bonds in the gel phase by only @xmath70 , while the latter condition destabilizes bonds by @xmath71 .",
    "thus , high salt / high charge conditions are more conducive to crystallization than low salt / low charge conditions .",
    "we speculate that the addition of multi - valent counterions may further reduce the entropic cost of neutralizing the crystal , athough a quantitative analysis of this scenario is beyond the limitations of our pb model .",
    "we have studied a minimal model of the crystallization and gelation of charged attractive spheres in aqueous salt solution .",
    "we find that there exists an electrostatic driving force that favors the gel over the crystal , because there exists more ion - accessible volume for confined counterions around a gel than within a crystal .",
    "this effect renders the effective interactions between macroions non - pairwise - additive , and is responsible for a narrowing of the crystallization window as macroion charge is increased .",
