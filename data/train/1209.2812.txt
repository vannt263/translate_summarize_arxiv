    "decoherence is a quantum phenomenon that plays an important role in connection both with the foundations of quantum physics and with its technological applications @xcite .",
    "decoherence is inextricably linked to another basic ingredient of the quantum world : quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "indeed , the diverse effects associated with the phenomenon of decoherence are due to the development of entanglement between the system under consideration and its environment .",
    "this entanglement , arising from the interaction between an imperfectly isolated system and its surroundings , leads to the gradual disappearance of various quantum features exhibited by the system .",
    "these effects are at the core of the nowadays orthodox , decoherence - based explanation of the quantum - to - classical transition @xcite .",
    "one of the most important consequences of decoherence is that the ( internal ) entanglement between the different parts of a composite system undergoing decoherence tends to decay .",
    "this manifestation of decoherence constitutes one of the main hurdles that has to be overcome for the implementation of quantum technologies that require entangled states as a resource @xcite .",
    "the decay of entanglement under decoherence has been the focus of an intense research activity in recent years @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting feature of this process , first pointed out by zyczkowski and the horodeckis in a pioneering effort almost ten years ago @xcite , is that sometimes entanglement vanishes completely in a finite time .",
    "this remarkable phenomenon , known as entanglement sudden death ( esd ) , has been the subject of several theoretical and experimental studies @xcite .",
    "studies of esd in markovian scenarios suggested that , once entanglement has vanished due to decoherence , this valuable resource is irremediably lost .",
    "however , the decoherence process in non - markovian regimes sometimes gives rise to an interesting new effect : entanglement sudden revival .",
    "the sudden revival of entanglement after a finite time interval with zero entanglement following an esd event has been recently investigated in @xcite .",
    "these works considered a system consisting of two independent qubits interacting with an environment at zero temperature in a non - markovian regime .",
    "the entanglement dynamics of open multiqubit systems in non - markovian regimes has also been considered in various recent works @xcite . in particular , multiqubit systems evolving from initial @xmath1 or @xmath2 states",
    "have been studied in detail in @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the average , typical entanglement - related features corresponding to some families of initial states of two - qubit , three - qubit , and four - qubit systems have been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the phenomenon of entanglement sudden revival allowed by non - markovian regimes deserves detailed scrutiny : it is of clear interest from the fundamental point of view and may also have technological implications .",
    "the aim of the present contribution is to explore ( statistically ) the typical behaviour of the entanglement exhibited by multipartite systems interacting with the above mentioned environment .",
    "in contrast to previous studies of entanglement evolution in non - markovian regimes , that focused on particular states or particular families of states , we will explore the average , typical entanglement dynamics associated with random , general initial pure states uniformly distributed according to the haar measure .",
    "we are also going to consider the average behaviour corresponding to mixed initial states consisting of a mixture of a ( random ) pure state and the totally mixed state .",

    "following @xcite we adopt for the reservoir an effective spectral density of the form    @xmath19    the parameter @xmath20 , defining the spectral width of the coupling , is then connected to the reservoir correlation time @xmath21 trough @xmath22 . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameter @xmath23 is associated with the system s relaxation time @xmath24 according to the relation @xmath25 ( see @xcite for details ) .",

    "it is seen that @xmath69 is relatively small compared with @xmath66 , which means that this last quantity is representative of the typical entanglement dynamics exhibited by the multiqubit system . in figure 1",
    "we also depict the curves corresponding to the entanglement decay of some important particular states , such as the @xmath0-qubit ghz state ( which is the maximally entangled state in the three qubit case ) and the maximally entangled states for four , five , and six qubit systems ( the corresponding curves in figures 1c-1d are identified with the label `` robust '' , for reasons explained below ) . for systems of four qubits",
    "we compute the entanglement evolution of the state hs , which was introduced by higuchi and sudbery in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "we plot the entanglement decay for the maximally entanglement states @xmath70 @xcite and @xmath71 @xcite . the hs four - qubit state and the @xmath71 six qubit states are specially relevant in connection with the process of decoherence because they also constitute robust states under decoherence . in a previous work",

    "the five qubit state @xmath70 does not coincide with the robust state reported in @xcite , but in the case of the dynamics studied in the present work , our numerical results indicate that both states lead to the same ( or very close ) average entanglement evolution .",
    "+    , title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    a particularly interesting aspect of figures 1a-1d is the status of the state ghz with respect to the typical behaviour of the entanglement dynamics of the multiqubit system . in the case of three - qubit systems the time dependent average entanglement is appreciably below the entanglement of states that evolved from the ghz one , particularly at those times when the system s entanglement reaches its maximum values .",
    "the situation is different in the case of four - qubits , where we found that the entanglement dynamics associated with a ghz initial state is quite representative of the typical , average dynamics associated with random initial states . on the other hand , for systems of five and six qubits the entanglement evolution associated with the ghz state does not reflect the average behaviour , which is more closely represented by the entanglement dynamics exhibited by states respectively evolving from the previously mentioned @xmath70 and @xmath71 states .",
    "+    , title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    evidence has been previously reported suggesting that in some situations the robustness of entanglement may increase with the number of qubits in the system @xcite .",
    "however , recent investigations @xcite indicate that , even when entanglement takes a long time to disappear , it rapidly adopts values too small to be of any practical relevance for technological applications .",
    "it is interesting to explore the dependence of the entanglement robustness on the number of qubits within the context of the non - markovian evolution studied in the present work .",

    "we compare the entanglement evolution yielded by initial ghz states of systems of three and six qubits .",
    "it transpires from this figure that the finite time intervals of zero entanglement are longer in the case of six qubits than in the case of three qubits .",
    "this suggests that the lengths of these intervals tend to increase with the number of qubits , consistently with other results for particular states recently reported in @xcite .",
    "this trend , however , is not observed when we evaluate the average entanglement evolution corresponding to random initial pure states , as can be appreciated in figure 2.b .",
    "furthermore , the average entanglement evolutions corresponding to random initial pure states of systems consisting of 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 qubits are depicted in figure 3 , showing an almost universal pattern .",
    "the average entanglement of random initial pure states thus seems to be less fragile than the entanglement corresponding to the ghz state .",

    "determined an upper bound for the entanglement of states evolved ( under the alluded decoherence channels ) from initial ghz states .",
    "they found , however , that the average entanglement of states evolved from random initial pure states does not comply with this bound , suggesting that the exponentially increasing fragility of the ghz entanglement with the number of qubits of the system is not a generic feature of typical pure states .",
    "our present results constitute further evidence also pointing towards the conclusion that the exponential ( in terms of system s size ) fragility of the ghz state may be a peculiarity of this state not shared by generic ones . on the contrary , general pure states , on average ,",

    "the quantity @xmath54 is able to detect entanglement only during the first period of entanglement decrease , but it does not detect the subsequent entanglement revivals .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the quality of the entanglement indicator @xmath54 tends to deteriorate as one considers states of increasing mixedness @xcite , and the multi - qubit systems under consideration here have a considerable degree of mixedness during the entanglement revival events . + it is known that the entanglement exhibited by composite quantum systems tends to decrease as we consider states with increasing degree of mixedness .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the average entanglement evolution of the system under consideration in the present work does not follow this general tendency .",
    "the average time evolution of both the negativity and the degree of mixedness ( as measured by the linear entropy @xmath77 of the time dependent state ) corresponding to random initial pure states of six qubits are depicted in figure 6 .",
    "we can see that , except for the initial entanglement decrease , the moments of high entanglement tend to coincide with moments of high mixedness .",
    "this point was recently highlighted in @xcite , in connection with the evolution of systems of two - qubits , and is also consistent with previous results advanced in @xcite . before discussing in more detail this aspect of the evolution of the multi - qubit systems discussed here it is worth mentioning that this behavior is atypical but should not be regarded as paradoxical .",
    "even if , as a general tendency , entanglement tends to decrease when the degree of mixedeness increases , there is no strict correlation between these two quantities .",
    "it is indeed possible to find pairs of states such that the state with higher mixedness is also the more entangled one . in spite of this , it is still interesting that the system s evolution considered here consists ( during certain time intervals ) of states showing this somewhat atypical characteristic .    , title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    to understand better this peculiarity let us first notice that the system s entanglement vanishes at those times when the parameter @xmath29 becomes equal to zero , @xmath78 . at these times",
    "the mixedness of the multi - qubit system also vanishes , because its state is given by @xmath79 , which is pure and separable . when starting from an initial entangled pure state @xmath80 , the evolution of the system s mixedness can be construed as arising from two opposite tendencies .",
    "first , due to the interaction with its surroundings , some entanglement is developed between the system and the environment and the system s mixedness tends to increase .",
    "on the other hand , as the evolution proceeds , the system eventually begins to approach the pure state @xmath81 , and its mixedness , after having achieved a maximum value , starts to decrease again .",
    "consequently , the resulting evolution comprises an initial phase of monotonous increase in the degree of mixedness followed by a period of decreasing mixedness during which its value goes back to zero . on the other hand , during this whole time interval before @xmath29 achieves its first zero , the system s entanglement decreases monotonously , finally vanishing when @xmath78 .",
    "notice that during the second half of this period , during which the system is evolving towards @xmath81 , the system s entanglement and mixedness both decrease together and finally vanish when @xmath78 .",
    "after this , when @xmath29 starts increasing again during the first entanglement revival , the system s entanglement and degree of mixedness grow together , reaching their respective maximum values approximately at the same time and then decreasing together as the system evolves back to the state @xmath81 .",
    "+      here we consider the entanglement decay of states of the form ( [ mixed - states ] ) , consisting of a statistical mixture of a pure state @xmath42 and the totally mixed state .",
    "our results are given in figure 7 , where the average negativity @xmath82 is plotted against @xmath72 and the parameter @xmath39 for systems of three and six qubits .",
