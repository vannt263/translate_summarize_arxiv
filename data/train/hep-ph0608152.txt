    "there has been much interest during the last years in the high energy part of the hadronic spectrum .",
    "the aim is to get a better understanding of the dynamics involved , in particular the confinement mechanism in hadrons . on the theoretical side",
    "some progress has been made .",
    "on the one hand , unquenched lattice qcd points out a string breaking in the static potential between two quarks @xcite what should be properly incorporated in the phenomenological description of the high energy hadronic spectrum through the coupling to open decay channels . on the other hand ,",
    "the idea of a parity multiplet classification scheme at high excitation energies as due to chiral symmetry has been suggested @xcite and recently put in question @xcite . on the experimental side",
    "the lack of precise and complete data prevents , at the current moment , to establish in a clear - cut way a classification scheme for the highly excited hadron spectrum .",
    "hence it may be appropriate to try to extract , from a simple dynamical quark model calculation and its comparison to data , some spectral patterns . to this purpose",
    "we shall consider the light baryon spectrum for which an extensive collection of data including high spin state masses , though not very precise in some cases , exists .",
    "we shall use a nonrelativistic quark potential model .",
    "the application of such approach for high excited states deserves some comments since the quarks inside the baryons may be ultra - relativistic , @xmath2 pair creation out of the vacuum becomes more and more relevant as the number of open decay channels increases , etc . as it is well - known these shortcomings , always implicit in the application of the naive quark model , do not invalidate its usefulness to provide information about the pattern of the quantum numbers of the baryon states . to get an unambiguous assignment of quantum numbers one should require the model to generate , inasmuch as possible , the correct number and ordering of the well established experimental states .",
    "different dynamical models providing accurate descriptions of the low energy baryon spectrum have been proposed @xcite .",
    "most of them rely on non - limited ( usually linearly dependent on the interquark distance ) confinement interactions . as a consequence , above 1.9 gev , there are many more predicted states than observed resonances .",
    "this _ missing state _ problem can be solved by ascribing experimental resonances ( in the @xmath3 partial wave analysis ) to predicted states with a significant coupling to the @xmath3 formation channel @xcite .",
    "alternatively the missing state problem can be obviated by using a quark - quark screened potential as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a correct prediction of the number and ordering of the known @xmath1 and @xmath4 resonances , up to 2.3 gev mass , is obtained .",
    "this points out to screening as an effective manner to give somewhat account of the coupling to @xmath3 channels ( lattice calculations have unveiled the close relation between screening and the opening of decay channels ) .",
    "such interpretation is supported by the fact that the quantum numbers of the dominant configurations ( for the ground and first excited states of given @xmath5 ) coming out from a screened potential ( containing only confinement and a residual one - gluon exchange ( oge ) interaction ) are in perfect agreement with the ones ascribed to data from refined non - screened models through the coupling analysis as we have explicitly checked for @xmath6 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for the identification of the available dominant non - screened configurations ) .",
    "though one can not expect , from the minimal screened dynamics employed , to get an accurate description of the values of the baryon masses , it is clear its convenience to provide an unambiguous assignment of quantum numbers to baryon states beyond the sometimes ad hoc arguments that have to be used in non - screened models to identify the experimental resonances when the @xmath3 coupling strengths have similar values for different predicted candidates .",
    "however the smooth screening parametrization employed in ref .",
    "@xcite , suggested from old lattice data @xcite , does not keep a direct relation to more recent lattice results @xcite pointing out a rather abrupt string breaking ( rehadronization ) transition in the potential .",
    "here we deepen this relation . to this purpose the comparison with a sharply saturated potential is useful .",
    "we analyze the resulting baryon spectrum for both ( smooth and sharp ) models and compare the resulting dominant configurations for any angular momentum .",
    "we generate patterns of quantum numbers and associate to them spectral regularities observed in the data . from them we are able to make purely phenomenological detailed predictions for resonances above 2.3 gev , many of them not experimentally identified yet . from data and our predictions we identify @xmath7 degeneracies and @xmath1 parity series that have a dynamical understanding within our quark model framework .",

    "in the absence of sea quarks lattice qcd predicts the static heavy quark - heavy antiquark ( @xmath8 ) interacting potential to rise linearly with the quark - antiquark distance @xcite .",
    "unquenched ( valence + sea quarks ) lattice calculations point out the existence of string breaking in qcd .",
    "this is , the static @xmath8 force becomes screened by intermediate light @xmath2 pairs , so that when the @xmath8 distance exceeds a critical value ( the breaking distance ) the @xmath8 potential saturates to a constant ( saturation energy ) . in the 1980 s a smooth screened potential",
    "was proposed to parametrize this effect bor89 . in the last decade",
    "such a parametrization has been implemented in valence quark models in an attempt to examine the consequences of string breaking in heavy quarkonia as well as in the nonstrange baryon spectra vij04,zha93,din95,bri00,gon03 .",
    "the simplest quark - quark screened potential , containing confinement and one gluon exchange terms , reads ( the factor @xmath9 has been explicitly written since it reflects the difference between the quark - quark and quark - antiquark interactions ) :    @xmath10 \\left ( \\frac{1-e^{-\\mu \\,\\,r_{ij}}}{\\mu \\,\\,r_{ij}}\\right ) + \\frac{\\overline{m_{0}}}{3 }   \\label{eq1}\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the interquark distance , @xmath12 the masses of the constituent quarks , @xmath13 the spin pauli operators , and @xmath14 is a constant to fix the ground state nucleon mass .",
    "the screening multiplicative factor appears between parenthesis on the right hand side .",
    "@xmath15 , the screening parameter , is the inverse of the saturation distance and its effective value is fitted together with the other parameters , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , to the spectrum ( @xmath19 fm for heavy quarkonia and @xmath20 fm for nonstrange baryons ) vij04,gon03 .    in the heavy meson sector",
    "a good description of bottomonium ( the only truly nonrelativistic quarkonia ) is obtained . for nonstrange baryons",
    "the model predicts quite approximately the number and ordering of the experimental states up to a mass of @xmath21 gev . for the sake of completeness",
    "we show improved results ( with more channels entering in the description ) from ref .",
    "@xcite in figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and [ f2 ] .",
    "let us note that the ordering discrepancies , related to the relative position of the first excited states of positive and negative parity in @xmath1 and @xmath22 , are endemic in this kind of quark model treatments ; the number discrepancy related to the presence of two , instead of one , excited states for @xmath23 and @xmath24 might have to do with the presence of two degenerate excitations at the experimental level of precision .",
    "more recent lattice qcd calculations @xcite show that the @xmath25 potential saturates sharply for a breaking distance of the order of 1.25 fm corresponding to a saturation energy of about twice the @xmath26 meson ( @xmath27 mass , indicating that the formation of two heavy - light subsystems ( @xmath28 is energetically favored . this information has been implemented in a quark model scheme @xcite showing that , as a consequence of coupled channels above the physical thresholds ( corresponding to the opening of decay channels ) , the description becomes progressively less accurate high in the spectrum .",
    "moreover the mixing with the continuum can also modify the short - range part of the interaction .",
    "nonetheless an effective ( renormalized ) nonscreened potential continues being useful up to energies not too far above the lowest physical threshold .",
    "these results provide some understanding of the successful application of the smooth screened potential of eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) in refs . @xcite and @xcite . for bottomonium , the maximum value of the potential , @xmath29 mev ( the @xmath30 mass has been chosen so that the constant term in the potential vanishes ) , translates into an upper limit for the energy of bound states of @xmath31 mev @xcite , far above the lowest physical threshold , assuring that the potential does not differ much from a nonscreened one ( corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) without the multiplicative screening factor ) for the experimentally known states . as a matter of fact one",
    "can alternatively use for bottomonium a ( linear + coulomb ) potential sharply saturated at an energy just above the highest resonance experimentally known ,    @xmath32    and maintain the quality of the description @xcite .",
    "let us note that this is the closest approach one can do to a nonscreened potential if one wants to extend its use high in energy since the sharp saturation prevents a proliferation of predicted states without experimental counterpart .",
    "we should then keep in mind that the fitted saturation distance , @xmath33 , should not be identified with the lattice breaking distance at the physical threshold but as an effective parameter to establish the limit of applicability of the model ( in fact its fitted value , 1.76 fm , differs a 30% of the breaking value 1.25 fm ) .    in the nonstrange baryon case , the maximum possible value of the energy of bound states for the screened potential in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath34 gev , just above the highest experimental resonance catalogued as four stars by the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite , @xmath35 at 2420 mev , reflects the difficulty of pushing the applicability limit of the model beyond this energy .",
    "it is interesting to make again a comparison with a sharply saturated potential of the form :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 + \\frac{% m_0}{3}\\ ] ]    whose parameters , given in table [ t1 ] , are fitted to get a global description of the nonstrange baryon spectrum while choosing @xmath33 to keep the same value for the saturation energy @xmath38 gev ( splitting energy of the three pairs of quarks ) .",
    "we draw this sharp potential and the smooth one in fig .",
    "the calculation of the spectrum proceeds exactly in the same manner as in ref .",
    "@xcite , to which we refer for technical details .",
    "let us only remind for the moment that two different calculational methods : hyperspherical harmonic expansion ( hh ) and faddeev , are employed and that convergence of the results is required .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in figs .",
    "[ f4 ] and [ f5 ] .",
    "it is worth to remark that the presence , in the three - body problem , of two - body thresholds ( for only one quark to be released , values quoted in table [ t2 ] ) , apart from the absolute three - body one ( saturation energy ) , may represent further constraints in the applicability limit of the model to any particular channel . as in ref .",
    "@xcite we have also included the predicted states close above the thresholds .    the comparison of figs .",
    "[ f4 ] and [ f5 ] with figs .",
    "[ f1 ] and f2 shows that the sharp potential tends quite generally to push upward the highest energy states .",
    "however , as we can check there is little difference concerning the number and ordering of states .",
    "both models give them quite reasonably .",
    "in other words the screened potential is quite similar , concerning these results , to the closest physical approach to a nonscreened potential , represented by the sharp interaction , that takes effectively into account the effect of the baryon decay to open channels in order to select the observed resonances .",
    "let us notice further that the sharp potential model permits to establish in a direct way the subtle connection between the lowest two - body ( 2bt ) and three - body thresholds ( 3bt ) : if the 3bt is increased ( changing for example @xmath39 and one refits the spin - spin and coulomb terms to recover the experimental @xmath40 mass difference , the 2bt is increased , almost linearly , in correspondence",
    ". otherwise said , the 2bt ( 3bt ) plus the @xmath41 mass difference fixes the 3bt ( 2bt ) .",
    "this is a realization of the idea that the mixing with the continuum ( at least partially contained in the effective thresholds ) affects the whole ( in particular the short ) range of the interaction .",
    "moreover , as the lowest 2bt corresponds to the lowest angular momentum state , the experimental presence of a well established high energy - low angular momentum state can be used as a lower bound to fix the lowest 2bt .",
    "then this fixing procedure determines the maximum energy at which a higher angular momentum state can be predicted within the range of applicability of the model ( a fine tune of this process has been carried out to get the spectrum ) .",
    "as shown in figs . [ f1 ] , [ f2 ] , [ f4 ] and [ f5 ] , the predicted nonstrange baryon spectra are quite analogous despite the difference between the two potentials .",
    "furthermore the dominant configurations entering any @xmath42 ground state and its first nonradial excitation are exactly the same for both potentials ( this is not the case for higher excitations as discussed below ) giving for them similar quantitative values that differ at most a 13% from data ( within the experimental uncertainties ) .",
    "hence it makes sense to proceed , from our dynamical models , to a quantum number assignement for these states . from the resulting patterns and from the experimental values of the masses of the known resonances",
    "we shall make predictions for higher energy states and we shall justify ( as implied by our dynamical model ) approximate degeneracies and the partial appearance of approximate parity doublets .      to express the spatial part of the dominant @xmath43 ground state configurations we shall use the hyperspherical harmonic notation ,",
    "i.e. , the quantum numbers @xmath44 the so - called great orbital ,  @xmath45 defines the parity of the state , @xmath46 and its centrifugal barrier energy , @xmath47 ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 : hyperrradius)@xmath50 @xmath51 is the orbital angular momentum of a pair of quarks , @xmath52 stands for the orbital angular momentum of the third quark with respect to the center of mass of this pair and @xmath53 ( @xmath54 is the total orbital angular momentum .",
    "alternatively one can write the parity as @xmath55 , since @xmath56 is always satisfied .",
    "@xmath57 specifies the spatial symmetry @xmath58 : $ ] symmetric , @xmath59 : $ ] mixed , @xmath60 : $ ] antisymmetric@xmath61 which combines to the spin , @xmath62 and isospin , @xmath63 symmetries @xmath64 symmetric ; @xmath65 mixed ) to have a symmetric wave function ( the color part is antisymmetric ) .",
    "more precisely , @xmath66 for @xmath1 and @xmath67 for @xmath22 , hence the spatial - spin wave function must be mixed for @xmath1 and symmetric for @xmath22 .",
    "it is convenient to group the ground states corresponding to the same dominant configuration in our model as done in tables [ t3 ] and [ t4 ] ( note that above 2.4 gev the dominant configurations correspond to an extrapolation of the pattern ) .    as a first general rule we have : @xmath68 for the dominant configuration in @xmath43 ground states .",
    "this comes , except for @xmath69 , from @xmath70 and/or @xmath71 components for which @xmath72 . for @xmath69 one",
    "has @xmath73 with @xmath74 instead of @xmath75 due to the more attractive spin - spin interaction .    the second general rule , of general validity for states with @xmath76 ,",
    "can be formulated as follows :    @xmath77    for states with lower total angular momentum such rule is not always verified . in particular , it is not fulfilled by the @xmath23 and @xmath78 .",
    "for @xmath23 the rule would prescribe @xmath79 , hence spin symmetric and consequently spatially mixed .",
    "dynamically a spatially symmetric @xmath80 configuration , with a spin - spin attractive contribution , is favoured . for @xmath81 , according to the parity expression , @xmath82 odd and eq .",
    "( [ ex3 ] ) can not be satisfied . in all these exceptional cases",
    "@xmath83 with @xmath84 minimal , provides the minimum energy . otherwise said , at the level of dominant configurations , the @xmath23 and the @xmath85 are degenerate as well as the @xmath81 and the @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "these degeneracies are quite well satisfied by data , see tables [ t3 ] and [ t4 ] .",
    "these two rules , complemented with the prescription of having the minimum value of @xmath87 ( i.e. , the minimum centrifugal barrier ) satisfying the symmetry requirements , express the minimum energy @xmath43 configuration coming out from our dynamical model .",
    "it is worth to mention that the same spectral patterns and rules could be also derived from a careful look at data in order to apply a general quark model multiplet structure as done in ref .",
    "however , in this case the lack of an underlying dynamics prevents , as pointed by the author , a justification for the phenomenological rules derived .      for positive parity states the emerging picture consists of two sets ( spatially symmetric and mixed corresponding to the upper and lower parts of table [ t3 ] , respectively ) of @xmath88 and @xmath89 grouped according to the same dominant configurations .",
    "each @xmath22 state , except for the @xmath69 , has a nucleon correspondence . for @xmath90",
    "its _ natural _ nucleon partner should be a @xmath23 with @xmath91 which , as mentioned above , is dynamically unfavored .",
    "actually , our model predicts for @xmath23 @xmath80 a lower mass than for @xmath92 as it is the experimental case .",
    "it is important to realize that the percentage of the dominant configuration in the sets varies : while for the upper part it can be quite different for @xmath93 and @xmath22 partners ( for example @xmath94 of @xmath95 ) $ ] for @xmath85 and 99% for @xmath96 for the lower part it is quite approximately the same and very close to @xmath97 ( for instance 99% of @xmath98 ) $ ] for @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 this has to do with the fact that for the lower part series only a spatially mixed wave function is allowed whereas for the upper part @xmath93 series there are , except for @xmath102 , two possibilities open for the same @xmath103 values : spatially symmetric ( spin - isospin symmetric ) and spatially mixed ( spin - isospin mixed ) .    for the upper part set the lowest lying states , @xmath102 and @xmath104 , with a dominant configuration @xmath105 ) $ ] , have an energy difference of 292 mev , entirely due in our model to the spin - spin potential , attractive for @xmath106 and repulsive for @xmath107 since for both states the percentage of the dominant configuration is almost the same ( @xmath108 for @xmath102 and @xmath97 for @xmath109 let us keep in mind that _ chiral _ contributions from meson exchanges are taken into account through the effective quark - gluon coupling constant fitted to the @xmath110 mass difference . for the next dominant configuration , containing the @xmath85 and the @xmath111 whose",
    "masses are quite well reproduced by our model , one has to consider the configuration mixing effect in @xmath85 ( @xmath94 of @xmath95 ) $ ] and @xmath112 of @xmath98 ) ) $ ] .",
    "let us realize though that both configurations would give the same energy for an hypercentral ( only @xmath113dependent ) potential .",
    "as our ( confinement + coulomb ) potential is quite close to an hypercentral one , the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath22 partners is again due in our model to the spin - spin interaction .",
    "we predict 199 mev .",
    "this means a slow variation of the spin - spin contribution when increasing @xmath87 and @xmath53 for spatially symmetric states ( actually the @xmath94 of the @xmath114 mass difference is @xmath115 mev ) .",
    "the experimental @xmath40 energy difference is bigger , @xmath116 270 mev , but also seem to vary slowly : @xmath117 mev , @xmath118 mev .",
    "this may be reflecting a larger probability for the spatially symmetric component than given by our model ( let us point in addition that the more cumbersome numerical procedure for @xmath119 states due to the presence of thresholds , makes less accurate our predictions , indeed the calculated energies for @xmath120 and @xmath35 are inverted respect to data ) .",
    "these quantitative differences should be expected given the shortcomings of our dynamical model .",
    "however the spectral pattern derived is very useful to make manifest a regularity in the data : the experimental @xmath1 and @xmath22 energy steps when going from one dominant configuration to the next one remain also constant about 500 mev : @xmath121 mev , @xmath122 mev , @xmath123 mev , @xmath124 mev ( this energy step can be associated , from our model , to @xmath125 ) .",
    "the extension of this pattern to further steps allows us to predict that a @xmath126 , if existing identifiable experimental resonances at such high energies , would have a mass of 3200 mev .    regarding the lower part set",
    "we should notice that the same configuration percentage for @xmath88 and @xmath89 would imply a degeneracy , term by term , if only spatial ( neither spin nor isospin dependence ) interactions were considered , @xmath127 ; @xmath128 , ... as a matter of fact , as for this set the spin - spin interaction ( the only non - spatial in our model ) gives little contribution , due to its short - range character and the spatial mixed symmetry involved ( with @xmath129 , the difference between the @xmath130 and @xmath99 masses ( the only states clearly below threshold ) is in our model less than @xmath131 what seems to be corroborated by data ( this could be an indication that isospin dependent interactions do not contribute significantly as well ) . concerning the energy step we expect , from our analysis above ( @xmath132 and the scarce data ( @xmath133 mev ) an approximate constant value around 400@xmath134500 mev .",
    "from it there would appear a @xmath135 at about 2450 mev ( the energy of its two stars @xmath136 partner is experimentally in the interval 2200@xmath1342500 mev ) , a @xmath137 and @xmath138 at about 2900 mev and a @xmath139 around 3300 mev .",
    "all predictions of our model up to 3 gev , from this subsection and next subsections [ subc ] and [ sube ] , are summed up in table [ t7 ] .      for negative parity states the results",
    "are organized in table [ t4 ] .",
    "the upper part corresponds to spatially mixed configurations for which we expect , from our model , a rapid decrement in the spin - spin energy difference between @xmath1 and @xmath22 partners when going from @xmath140 to @xmath141 and , as a consequence , all the states with the same dominant configuration should become close in mass .",
    "the data seem to follow this prescription : mass differences of 180 mev at most for @xmath140 , 60 mev for @xmath142 .",
    "again the spectral pattern makes manifest the energy step ( 400@xmath134500 mev ) regularity in the data : ( @xmath143 mev ; @xmath144 mev , @xmath145 mev ) as it corresponds to @xmath125 .",
    "therefore one would expect a @xmath146 and a @xmath147 at about 2650 mev and a @xmath148 , a @xmath149 and a @xmath150 at about 3050 mev .",
    "the lower part of table [ t4 ] contains an independent series of @xmath151 without @xmath88 partners .",
    "all states are above their lowest threshold . from the analysis above",
    "we can expect again a step energy , corresponding to @xmath152 of around 400@xmath134500 mev that turns out to be compatible with data within the experimental errors .",
    "from it a @xmath153 would be located at approximately 3200 mev .      according to our model",
    ", the masses of the @xmath154 and @xmath155 in the left hand side of table [ t4 ] should become degenerate as the effective spin - spin interaction becomes weaker and the potential approaches an hypercentral one .",
    "this seems also to be the experimental situation .    on the other hand",
    ", the @xmath156 and @xmath157 on the right hand side of table [ t3 ] should become degenerate as the spin - spin contribution for @xmath158 ( significantly smaller than for @xmath106 in spatially symmetric states ) is not quantitatively much different for spatially symmetric and mixed states .",
    "this is confirmed by the scarce data available ( @xmath159 ) .",
    "these results , from data and our predictions , are picked up in table [ t5 ] .",
    "we can express its content in a schematic simplified manner through : @xmath160    let us realize that for positive parity eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) corresponds to a rule derived in ref .",
    "@xcite from a phenomenological mass formula obtained from the assumption of linear regge trajectories .      for excited states in general",
    "the situation is much more cumbersome . though both models , smooth and sharp , provide a similar pattern a more careful analysis of the configurations entering the states makes clear significant differences .",
    "for instance the fourth @xmath102 state has for the smooth potential a @xmath98 ) , s=3/2 $ ] component degenerate ( at the level of precision of the model ) with the @xmath161),$ ] @xmath106 , while the same state corresponds uniquely to the last configuration for the sharp potential . for @xmath162 in the sharp case , the radial excitation of @xmath105 ) , s=3/2 $ ] and the @xmath98 ) , s=1/2",

    "in contrast to this inadequacy to deal with the radial excitations and the strong model dependence of the configurations for higher ( second and up ) excitations , our dynamics provides a very simple picture for the first non - radial excitations that follows the trend of data .",
    "the rule , coming from the absence of spin - orbit and tensor forces in our model , and again of general validity for @xmath76 , is :    _ the first non - radial excitation of @xmath163 and the ground state of @xmath164 respectively , are almost degenerate . _ ( 8)    this rule is satisfied by existing data at the level of @xmath165 , table [ t6 ] .",
    "from now on we will denote by a black dot the first non - radial excitation of any state . the only significant deviation from the previous rule",
    ", @xmath166 ( @xmath167 of difference ) , corresponds to two resonances catalogued as one star by the pdg .",
    "indeed the degeneracy can be accomplished within the experimental uncertainties , see fig .",
    "[ f5 ] .    assuming this approximate degeneracy we can guess , from data and from our phenomenological ground state predictions above , the masses for the first non - radial excited states with a question mark in table [ t6 ] .",
    "these predictions , up to @xmath168 gev , are summed up in table [ t7 ] .",
    "for @xmath169 the rule is only satisfied , according to our model , by @xmath170 and @xmath162 .",
    "for some of the remaining states our model gives also definite relations between their first non - radial excitations and other ground or excited states .",
    "these relations are quite reasonably satisfied by the data too : @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 .",
    "it is worth to remark that some of our findings in table [ t7 ] might be in fact already accomplished by current data although being masked by the experimental uncertainties ( see figs .",
    "[ f4 ] and [ f5 ] ) .",
    "for example the @xmath174 could be , within theoretical plus experimental errors , in the @xmath175 , the @xmath176 in the @xmath177 and so on .",
    "we should also realize that some of the predicted resonances could have small couplings to formation channels what would make difficult its detection ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite regarding @xmath178 , @xmath179 and @xmath180 ) .      a look at tables [ t3 ] , [ t4 ] and [ t7 ] shows some approximate @xmath181 parity doublets .",
    "thus , for @xmath76 the @xmath182 ground state series in the upper part of table [ t3 ] and the @xmath183 ground state series in the upper part of table [ t4 ] appear almost degenerate , term by term , for example @xmath184 , as shown on the left hand side of table [ t8 ] . from our model",
    "we can propose a qualitative systematic for this doubling : the bigger repulsion in the positive parity state with respect the negative parity one , due to @xmath185 , is compensated by the bigger attraction in a spatially symmetric @xmath106 configuration ( i.e. , @xmath186 .",
    "we can quantify these effects from our data analysis above .",
    "we can estimate an increment of the repulsion energy of @xmath187 mev ( from @xmath188 mev for @xmath189 as previously discussed ) and an increment in the attraction , when going from @xmath158 to @xmath106 of approximately the same amount .",
    "so we can predict further parity doublings , @xmath190 , ... moreover the application of our preceding rules for the first non - radial excitations gives rise to an equivalent approximate parity doublet series , right hand side of table [ t8 ] .    for @xmath89",

    ", we expect our model not to support this suggestion .",
    "indeed going from the positive to the corresponding negative parity state we expect the centrifugal repulsion getting increased @xmath195 and the spin - spin interaction changing from attractive @xmath196 to repulsive @xmath197 , hence the @xmath198 states should be higher in mass than the @xmath199 ones",
    ".    we should realize that the approximate @xmath1 parity doublets appear discretely , every 500 mev .",
    "this does not preclude the existence for other energies of additional ( @xmath1 and/or @xmath22 ) parity doublets involving higher excitations but we can not carry out for them a trustable analysis .",
    "we have performed a phenomenological analysis of the nonstrange baryon spectrum between 2.3 and 3 gev .",
    "our starting point is a quark model potential , containing confinement and oge interactions saturating at 2.4 gev , that gives the correct number and ordering of known resonances up to 2.3 gev .",
    "the study of the dominant configurations entering the ground state and the first non - radial excitations provides us with quantum number spectral patterns .",
    "the extrapolation of these patterns to higher energies allows the prediction , from existing data , of ground ( @xmath200 and first non - radial excited ( @xmath201 state masses in the quite experimentally uncertain energy region from 2.3 to 3 gev .",
    "it is precisely this uncertainty , reflecting the transition to the continuum , what makes our picture plausible despite the blown up number of _ new _ states .",
    "the qualitative adequacy of our model description to data suggests that the effective ( confinement+coulomb+spin - spin ) dynamics employed ( we have estimated numerically small contributions of conventional meson exchange potentials to the mass of @xmath76 baryons ) contains the essential ingredients to give account of the observed regularities in the spectrum . to this respect",
    "we should emphasize i ) the usefulness of screening as an effective mechanism in quark potential models to provide an unambiguous assignment of quantum numbers to states ( this is related to the connection of screening to decay channel effects as shown by lattice calculations ) and ii ) the importance of using the hyperspherical harmonic basis as the more convenient to deal , from the point of view of the physical interpretation , with the quasi - hypercentral potential considered .    from data and our predictions we find on the one hand approximate @xmath7 degeneracies and on the other hand series of @xmath1 parity doublets involving ground or first non - radial excitations exclusively .",
    "we get from our minimal dynamics some understanding about how these degeneracies come out .",
    "we should finally remark that our results do not rely on any symmetry assumption in qcd , but on a particular dynamics that provides a spectral pattern in agreement to data . since existing data beyond 1.9 gev",
    "are plagued with large experimental errors we can not pretend our quantitative predictions to be very precise . nonetheless we think our findings can be of help for the always needed experimental spectral searches in this region as well as for the theoretical progress in the dynamical interpretation of data .",
