    "it is a theorem of artin and tits that two finite simple groups of the same order are isomorphic except for the pairs @xmath10 this theorem was first proved by emil artin in 1955 for the finite simple groups that were known then @xcite .",
    "as new finite simple groups were discovered , tits @xcite verified that the above pairs are the only pairs of non - isomorphic finite simple groups of the same order .",
    "one may also look in @xcite for an exposition of these proofs .",
    "we investigate in this paper the situation for the groups of @xmath5-rational points of a split semisimple algebraic group @xmath4 defined over a finite field @xmath5 . since the orders of the groups @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the same if @xmath4 and @xmath13 are isogenous and since the simply connected group is unique in an isogeny class , we concentrate only on simply connected groups .",
    "since the groups @xmath14 and @xmath15 have the same order for @xmath16 and for all @xmath17 , we do not distinguish between them .",
    "this paper is arranged as follows .",
    "we state some preliminary lemmas in  2 which are used in the proofs of the main theorems .",
    "section  3 is devoted to determining the field @xmath5 from the order of the group @xmath11 .",
    "the first natural step in that direction is to obtain its characteristic .",
    "we prove that under certain mild conditions , the order of the group @xmath11 determines the characteristic of @xmath5 ( theorem  [ thm : characteristic ] ) .",
    "we further prove that it eventually determines the base field ( theorem  [ thm : field ] ) .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be two split semisimple simply connected algebraic groups defined over finite fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "let @xmath22 denote the set @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is a prime and @xmath25 is a prime of the form @xmath26 .",
    "suppose that , for @xmath27 is not a direct factor of @xmath9 whenever @xmath28 and @xmath29 is not a direct factor of @xmath9 whenever @xmath30 .",
    "then , if @xmath31 , the characteristics of @xmath20 and @xmath21 are equal .    since @xmath32 ,",
    "the above theorem is not true in general .",
    "we feel that this is the only counterexample , i.e. , the conclusion of theorem  [ thm : characteristic ] is true without the hypothesis imposed there except that we must exclude the case of @xmath33 over @xmath34 and @xmath35 over @xmath36 , but we have not been able to prove it .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be two split semisimple simply connected algebraic groups defined over finite fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 of the same characteristic .",
    "suppose that the order of the finite groups @xmath37 and @xmath38 are the same , then @xmath39 .",
    "moreover the fundamental degrees ( and their multiplicities ) of the weyl groups @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the same .",
    "let @xmath18 and @xmath19 be two split semisimple simply connected algebraic groups defined over a finite field @xmath5 . if the finite groups @xmath7 and",
    "@xmath8 have the same order then the orders of the groups @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the same for any finite extension @xmath44 of @xmath5 .",
    "thus , the question now boils down to classifying the split semisimple simply connected groups @xmath45 defined over a fixed field @xmath5 such that the orders of the finite groups @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the same .",
    "we first characterise such pairs where each of the groups @xmath18 and @xmath19 can be written as a direct product of exactly two simple groups .",
    "we find that all such pairs can be generated by a ` nice ' set of pairs , which admit a geometric reason for the order coincidence .",
    "we make further observations regarding the pairs of order coincidence at the end of  4 .",
    "these observations lead us to a natural question which we answer in the affirmative in  5 .",
    "this question is about describing all the pairs @xmath6 of groups defined over a fixed finite field @xmath5 , where the groups @xmath9 have no common simple factor and the orders of the groups @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the same .",
    "the set of such pairs admits a structure of an abelian , torsion - free group .",
    "we determine an explicit set of generators for this group ( theorem  [ thm : gen ] ) .    section  6 deals with a geometric reasoning for the ` nice ' set of pairs of order coincidence given by transitive action of compact lie groups .",
    "if @xmath4 is a compact lie group and @xmath45 are connected subgroups of @xmath4 such that the natural action of @xmath19 on @xmath46 is transitive , then it can be seen that the split forms of @xmath47 and @xmath48 have the same number of @xmath5-rational points for any finite field @xmath5 .",
    "we give such geometric reasoning for the first three pairs described in theorem  [ thm : gen ] .",
    "it would be interesting to know if other pairs also admit such geometric reasoning .",
