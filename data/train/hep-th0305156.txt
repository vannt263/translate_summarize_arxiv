    "we will examine newton law arising due to the gravity localized on the brane when general singular brane is embedded in @xmath0 bulk .",
    "the newton law on the brane was firstly computed by rs in ref.@xcite when the bulk spacetime is @xmath0 . in this case the gravity localized on the brane yields an @xmath1-type @xmath5 and @xmath6 subleading correction arising due to kaluza - klein exictation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a radius of @xmath0 . under the same setup",
    "an improvement of the potential was tried by involving the brane - bending effect@xcite and by computing the one - loop correction to the gravitational propagator@xcite , which slightly changes the sub - leading correction by a overall multiplication factor @xmath9    subsequently , the gravitational propagator for the linearized fluctuation equation in rs picture is generally computed by adopting the singular quantum mechanics(sqm ) as a calculational tool@xcite . from the viewpoint of sqm",
    "the linearized gravitational propagator is crucially dependent on the boundary condition(bc ) that the propagator should satisfy at the location of the brane .",
    "the physically relevant bc is not uniquely determined in the framework of sqm due to the singular nature of the potential and the physically consistent bcs are parametrized by a real parameter , say @xmath10 .",
    "the physically consistent bcs are in general introduced by a self - adjoint extension technique@xcite , which is effectively identical to the coupling constant renormalization@xcite .",
    "recently , this generalized gravitational propagators are used to compute the newton potential on the brane@xcite with a particular choice of @xmath10 as @xmath11 , which means the dirichlet and neumann bcs are included with an equal weight .",
    "recently , the newton law with different setup is also considered .",

    "recently , this fact is again confirmed in the context of sqm@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will examine the newton potential using the generalized gravitational propagators derived using sqm .",

    "the @xmath10-dependence of the newton potential is examined throughout the paper .",

    "when @xmath19 , we have a neumann brane in which the gravity acquires mass@xcite .",
    "it is well - known that the newton potential generated due to the exchange of a massive graviton is exponentially suppressed at long range .",
    "this fact will be explicitly shown in the following . at @xmath20 we have a dirichlet brane . in this case the non - trivial gravitational propagator can be derived _ via _ the coupling constant renormalization@xcite .",
    "thus the final expression of the newton potential is dependent on the renormalized coupling constant .",
    "we will show in the following that when the renormalized coupling constant has a particular valus , the newton potential on the dirichlet brane is proportional to that on rs brane which corresponds to the brane at @xmath11 .",

    "in this section we will compute the newton potential arising due to the localized gravity on the brane when there is no @xmath1 induced einstein term .",

    "there is an intermediate range @xmath16 , in which newton potential is five - dimensional . at other ranges",
    "the four - dimensional newton law is recovered .    for neumann brane the long - range newton potential",
    "is exponentially suppressed regardless of the existence of the @xmath1 induced einstein term .",
    "this is because the gravity localized on the neumann brane acquires a mass . in the short - range newton potential",
    "becomes five - dimensional with a logarithmic subleading correction if there is no @xmath1 induced einstein term .",
    "the einstein term in neumann brane yields a similar intermediate range to that in rs brane , where newton law is five - diemnsional .    for dirichlet brane",
    "the non - trivial fixed - energy amplitude can be derived _ via _ the coupling constant renormalization scheme .",
    "thus , newton potential on the dirichlet brane is usually dependent on the renormalized coupling constant @xmath4 . if @xmath184 , the final expression of newton potential is proportional to that in rs brane .",
    "if @xmath185 , the long - range behavior of newton potential is expontially suppressed due to the massive gravity regardless of the @xmath1 induced einstein term . in short - range newton potential exhibits an pecular @xmath148 behavior if @xmath145 .",
    "however , the @xmath1 einstein term makes the short - range behavior of newton potential on dirichlet brane to be exactly identical to that on neumann brane .",
    "recently , newton law arising due to the localized gravity on various curved brane is examined when bulk is @xmath186 or @xmath0@xcite .",
    "our sqm technique may be applied straightforwardly to these various scenarios . the explicit result will be given elsewhere .",
