    "the study of the motion of charged particles in an external magnetic field is of importance in many fields of physics .",

    "few - electron systems can be engineered with great precision in nanodevices in quantum - dots and the excitation spectrum of the system has been studied experimentally and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the presence of interactions causes intricate correlation effects , most prominently discussed within the fractional quantum hall effect .",
    "but before one can proceed to large systems , it is important to reduce the complexity and study the simplest example , which still permits an analytical and numerical exact solution . for two- and many electron - atoms moshinsky , novaro , and",
    "calles devised the pseudo - atom @xcite , where the coulomb interactions are replaced by a repelling harmonic oscillator potential in order to solve the many - body problem exactly and to obtain quantitative error bounds for the hartree - fock method .",
    "interacting electrons in a magnetic field show a particular rich behavior , since the repulsion leads to an initial increase in distance .",
    "this is converted by the velocity - dependent lorentz force into the cyclotron motion , which brings all charges back together and no particle escape is possible if the system is confined to two - dimensions .",
    "the solution of fock @xcite , landau @xcite , and darwin @xcite for the limit of the non - interacting case are discussed in many textbooks on nanodevices @xcite , while the solution for the interacting case has been found many decades later @xcite .",
    "already the classical system reveals a complicated dynamics due to the interplay of the lorentz force in the magnetic field and the electric field generated by the electron - electron repulsion @xcite . in nanodevices , electronic properties are often probed in a two - dimensional layer perpendicular to the magnetic field direction @xcite and thus a reduction of the three - dimensional problem to a quasi two - dimensional one is justified and needed to understand the experimental measurements .    here",
    ", we analyze the interacting two - electron problem in the absence of an additional confining potential , since we are interested in the intrinsic dynamical properties of the system . after studying the exact quantum - mechanical stationary solution , which is available only for specific parameters , we present a semiclassical analysis covering all interaction values .",
