    "let @xmath5 is an @xmath0-cobordism between smooth manifolds @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "since pioneering work in the 1980 s it has been known that @xmath6 and @xmath7 are not necessarily diffeomorphic @xcite , but they are homeomorphic @xcite when the fundamental group is of a certain type , called `` good '' ( a kind of time - dependent definition ) by practitioners .",
    "good groups @xcite were built from the class of polynomial growth groups and later the more general subexponential class by closure under four operations : extension , quotient , direct limit , and subgroup .",
    "it is tempting to guess that good groups can be extended to all amenable groups , but this is not presently known .    though the question of any classification up to diffeomorphism seems completely intractable at this point , it was noticed by quinn @xcite in the 1970 s that these subtleties disappear under stabilization .",
    "that is , there exists a natural number @xmath1 so that @xmath8 is a product cobordism , where for a @xmath4-manifold @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) @xmath9 and for a @xmath10-dimensional cobordism @xmath5 , @xmath11 denotes the `` connected sum @xmath12 $ ] '' with @xmath13 summed parametrically along a vertical arc in @xmath5 . for the remainder of the paper",
    "we denote @xmath14 by @xmath15 , and `` connected sum @xmath12 $ ] '' by @xmath16 .",
    "this paper is concerned with how small @xmath1 can be .",
    "when @xmath6 and @xmath7 are simply connected complete intersections , it follows from @xcite ( and a little five - dimensional surgery ) that @xmath17 suffices . beyond this , little seems to be known : no argument from gauge theory or any other direction excludes ( as far as we know ) the possibility that @xmath17 suffices universally .",
    "suppose @xmath18 and @xmath19 is an infinite collection of finite index subgroups of @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "we let @xmath22 denote the index @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "consider the corresponding covering spaces @xmath24 with @xmath25 and define @xmath26 to be the minimal @xmath1 so that @xmath27 is a product .",
    "it is clear that @xmath28 , since @xmath29 , i.e. the covering space of @xmath30 corresponding to @xmath31 is @xmath32 .",
    "the main theorem of this paper is :    [ thm : main ] if @xmath33 is an amenable group , then for any sequence of subgroups @xmath34 with @xmath35 we have @xmath36    more generally the theorem holds if the maximal residually finite quotient of @xmath33 is amenable .",
    "recall that the maximal residually finite quotient of a group @xmath20 is the quotient group @xmath37 , where the intersection ranges over all finite index subgroups .",
    "the main theorem is actually a combination of two theorems , one in smooth topology and one in coarse geometry . before stating these we discuss the notion of sweepout width of a coset space .",
    "we consider a finitely generated group @xmath20 as a discrete metric space by choosing a finite generating set and building its cayley graph .",
    "the distance between two group elements is then defined to be the minimal number of edges needed to join them in the cayley graph .",

    "then there is a constant @xmath57 not depending on @xmath58 so that @xmath59 .",
    "often theorem [ thm : main topology ] gives better bounds than theorem [ thm : main ] , if we have additional knowledge of the group @xmath33 or the sequence @xmath31 .",
    "for example :    [ cor : pi1 z ] let @xmath53 be a smooth @xmath10-dimensional @xmath0-cobordism as above , suppose @xmath60 , and let @xmath24 be the covering space of @xmath5 corresponding to the subgroup @xmath61 .",

    "suppose @xmath6 and @xmath7 are closed @xmath4-manifolds and there is a homeomorphism @xmath69 with vanishing kirby - siebenmann invariant .",
    "then @xmath70 has a controlled isotopy to a diffeomorphism , and using this diffeomorphism one can build a smooth @xmath0-cobordism @xmath5 with @xmath71 .",
    "therefore if @xmath72 is amenable theorem [ thm : main ] tells us that the number of @xmath73 connect sums required to make @xmath6 diffeomorphic to @xmath7 is subextensive in covers .",
    "does the same hold true if @xmath74 ?",
    "gompf @xcite and kreck @xcite independently proved that if @xmath74 then there is a homeomorphism @xmath75 so that @xmath76 . but even a single copy of @xmath73 connect summed before construction of @xmath5 leads to an extensive number of @xmath73 s in covers , so this fact can not be directly applied .",

[ prop : folquot ] if @xmath20 is a finitely generated group with generating set @xmath85 and @xmath38 is a subgroup , then for all @xmath102 ,    @xmath103    we briefly discuss why this proposition is tricky and the main idea of the proof .",

    "part of the problem is that some points in @xmath111 may have many preimages in @xmath42 while other points in @xmath111 may have few preimages in @xmath42 .",
    "instead of working just with @xmath111 , it turns out to be more natural to consider a different type of pushforward from @xmath20 to @xmath114 which takes into account the number of preimages .",
    "suppose that @xmath115 is a function with finite support .",
    "then we define the pushforward @xmath116 by    @xmath117    to make good use of the pushforward for functions , we recall the notion of the gradient of a function on a graph .",

    "if @xmath119 is an unoriented edge with boundary vertices @xmath120 and @xmath121 , then we can still define @xmath123 :    @xmath124    this gradient is closely related to the size of the boundary of a set : for any set @xmath79 , we have    @xmath125    the set @xmath126 that we construct comes from @xmath127 , where @xmath128 denotes the characteristic function of @xmath42 .",
    "more precisely , @xmath126 is a super - level set of the pushforward , @xmath129 for some @xmath130 .",
    "the first step in the proof of proposition [ prop : folquot ] is    [ lem : pushdown ] if @xmath115 has finite support , then    @xmath131    for each @xmath132 and each @xmath86 , either @xmath133 or there is an edge from @xmath134 to @xmath135 in the graph @xmath136 .",

    "the first equation becomes :    @xmath149    the second equation becomes :    @xmath150    therefore , there exists some integer @xmath151 so that    @xmath152    we let @xmath153 .",

    "we choose a sweepout @xmath355 of @xmath354 so that @xmath356 .",
    "let @xmath357 .",
    "we show that @xmath348 is a trivial product , which shows that @xmath358 suffices for the conclusion of the proposition .    by convention",
    "we think of all red spheres in @xmath359 as fixed , and gradually isotope the blue spheres so that they are in geometrically canceling position , i.e. , they intersect only one red sphere , and intersect it exactly once .",
    "we trivialize @xmath360 inductively in @xmath281 .",
    "more precisely , we prove the following statement :    suppose we can find an isotopy of the blue spheres @xmath361 so that all blue spheres in @xmath362 are in geometrically canceling position .",
    "suppose further that there are @xmath363 disjoint copies of @xmath364 in @xmath365 , so that each copy intersects only a single blue sphere in @xmath366 , and each such blue sphere intersects at most @xmath350 copies of @xmath364 .",
    "then we can find an isotopy satisfying the same property for @xmath367 .",
    "@xmath367 differs from @xmath362 by addition of a single vertex .",
    "if that vertex is a red sphere , then we do nothing : the blue spheres in @xmath362 are exactly the same as the blue spheres in @xmath367 , and also the blue spheres in @xmath366 are the same as the blue spheres in @xmath367 since @xmath354 is bipartite .",
    "so suppose @xmath368 is a blue sphere , @xmath369 .",
    "after the given isotopy there are at most @xmath370 copies of @xmath15 which intersect some blue sphere , therefore there are at least @xmath371 copies of @xmath15 which are disjoint from all blue spheres . since @xmath372 is adjacent to at most @xmath350 whitney disks , we can use these @xmath350 copies of @xmath15 to replace these whitney disks with disjointly embedded whitney disks .",
    "we can then apply the whitney move to these disks , which brings @xmath372 into algebraically canceling position .",
    "the price we pay is that @xmath372 now intersects these copies of @xmath15 .",
    "it remains to show that any blue spheres which are in @xmath373 can be made disjoint from all copies of @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath374 be such a blue sphere , and let @xmath375 be its paired red sphere . since @xmath376 it is in canceling position , meaning it intersects @xmath375 in a single point and intersects no other red spheres .",
    "also @xmath375 intersects no other blue spheres : if @xmath377 , then @xmath378 is not in geometrically canceling position , which means @xmath379 , contradicting the fact that @xmath380 .",
    "let @xmath382 be diffeomorphic to @xmath364 , so that @xmath383 .",
    "let @xmath384 .",
    "each intersection @xmath385 can be resolved by pushing @xmath386 along an arc in @xmath374 and piping off the intersection to parallel copies of @xmath375 .",
    "see figure [ fig : remove ] .",
    "after this process we have constructed a new zero framed copy of @xmath387 , and its neighborhood is a new copy of @xmath364 which is disjoint from all blue spheres and all other copies of @xmath364 .",
