    "one interesting object to study in connection with the physics of heavy quarks is the vacuum polarization function of two electromagnetic currents .",
    "this requires high order perturbative calculations which , because of the obvious need to keep a nonzero mass @xmath4 for the quark , become extremely difficult to perform .",
    "this is why , while the @xmath5 and @xmath6 contributions have been known for a long time @xcite , state of the art calculations can only produce a result at @xmath3 in the form of an expansion at low energies ( i.e. @xmath1 ) , at high energies ( i.e. @xmath7 ) or at threshold ( i.e. @xmath8 ) , but not for the complete function , which is still out of calculational reach . in this circumstances",
    ", it would of course be very interesting to be able to reconstruct this function by some kind of interpolation between the former three expansions .",
    "after the work in refs .",
    "@xcite , it has become customary to attempt this reconstruction of the vacuum polarization function with the help of pade approximants . since these approximants are ratios of two polynomials in the variable @xmath0 , they are very suitable for the matching onto the low - energy expansion .",
    "this is so because this low-@xmath0 expansion is truly an expansion in powers of @xmath0 , as a consequence of the finite energy threshold , where @xmath9 is the pion mass . ]",
    "starting at @xmath10 .",
    "however , it is clear that they can not fully recover the nonanalytic terms which appear , e.g. , in the form of logarithms of @xmath0 in the expansion at high energies ( or at threshold , where there is also a squared root behavior ) . therefore , what is really done in practice is to first subtract all these logarithmic pieces from the full function ( impossible to match exactly with a pade ) with the help of a _ guess _",
    "function with the appropriate threshold and high - energy behavior , and then apply pades to the remaining regular expression . in this way , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite were able to compute , e.g. , the value of the constant @xmath2 appearing in the @xmath3 expansion of the vacuum polarization at threshold , which has not yet been possible to obtain from a feynman diagram calculation .",
    "although this result is very interesting , the construction is not unique . as recognized in ref .",
    "@xcite , some amount of educated guesswork is required in order to resolve the inherent ambiguity in the procedure .",
    "for instance , a certain number of unphysical poles are encountered , and some additional criteria have to be imposed in order to decide how to discard these poles . since the resulting ambiguity leads to a systematic error which needs to be quantified , this error",
    "is then estimated by varying among several of the possible arbitrary choices in the construction .",
    "although all these choices are made judiciously and in a physically motivated manner , it is very difficult to be confident of the error made in the result , which obviously has an impact on the value extracted for the constant @xmath2 .    in this short note",
    "we would like to point out that , regarding the vacuum polarization function , one can do away with all the above ambiguities .",
    "the vacuum polarization function belongs to a class of functions ( the so - called stieltjes functions ) for which a well - known theorem assures that the diagonal ( and paradiagonal ) pade approximants converge .",
    "the result of this theorem together with the fantastic amount of information obtained on the taylor expansion around @xmath1 , for which 30 terms are known @xcite , will allow us to predict a value for @xmath2 .",
    "as it turns out , our result is very close to that of ref .",
    "@xcite , although slightly smaller .    the theory of pade approximants is sufficiently developed to make these approximants a systematic mathematical tool .",
    "as we will see in this article , and has been exploited in refs .",
    "@xcite , they can be very useful for higher order calculations in perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , they can also be a very interesting conceptual tool for large-@xmath11 qcd @xcite . in this case",
    "this is true even when the function is not stieltjes because large-@xmath11 qcd green s functions are meromorphic and there are powerful theorems in this case as well @xcite .",
    "finally , pades can also be used for analyzing the experimental data by fitting to a rational function rather than the more commonly used polynomial fitting@xcite .",
    "they are also instrumental in discussing methods of unitarization @xcite .",
    "let us start by defining the vacuum polarization function @xmath12 through the correlator of two electromagnetic currents @xmath13 , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the external four - momentum .",
