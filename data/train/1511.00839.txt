    "the access to the terahertz ( thz ) frequency range or far - infrared ( fir ) wavelength range from the ground is mostly limited by the absorption of water vapor in the earth s atmosphere .",
    "therefore , the thz region is one of the remaining unexplored wavelength ranges from the ground .",
    "space , balloon - borne , and airborne observations have so far been used to explore thz astronomy .",
    "there are only limited sites on earth where the thz windows are accessible , and ground - based thz astronomy is , indeed , possible .",
    "greenland ( section [ subsec : glt ] ) , high - altitude ( @xmath35,000 m ) chilean sites @xcite , and antarctica @xcite are examples of suitable places for ground - based thz astronomy .    even in those locations",
    "suitable for thz observations , the time of excellent weather is still limited .",
    "therefore , observations need to be planned well in order to maximize the scientific output within the limited amount of observing time . moreover , `` first - generation '' observations are especially important because they determine the direction of subsequent thz science .",
    "there have already been some pioneering efforts of ground - based thz observations such as with the receiver lab telescope ( rlt ; @xcite ) , the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ; @xcite ) , and the atacama submillimeter telescope experiment ( aste ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , the attempts by these existing facilities have been difficult and sparse due to challenging weather conditions .",
    "a dedicated telescope at an excellent site  as proposed for the glt  is , thus , paramount for successful thz observations . in practice ,",
    "such first - generation observations are associated with the development of thz detectors .",
    "searching for targets that are relatively easy to observe but scientifically pioneering , is of fundamental importance to maximize the scientific value of the instrumental development .",
    "the first aim of this paper is , thus , to search for scientifically important and suitable targets for first - generation thz science cases .    the largest advantage of ground - based thz telescopes compared with space telescopes ( e.g. , _ herschel _ ; @xcite ) , airborne telescopes ( e.g.",
    ", the stratospheric observatory for infrared astronomy ( sofia ) ; @xcite ) , and balloon - borne telescopes is that it is possible to operate large dishes with a high diffraction - limited resolving capability . to clarify this advantage , it is convenient to have a specific telescope in mind in discussing science cases . in this paper",
    ", we focus on the greenland telescope ( glt ) .",
    "the glt project is planning to deploy an atacama large millimeter / submillimeter ( alma)-prototype 12-m antenna to the summit station in greenland ( 3,200 m altitude ) for the purpose of using it as part of submillimter ( submm ) very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) telescopes ( * ? ? ? * see also section [ sec : glt ] ) .",
    "data of atmospheric transmission at the summit station have been accumulated over the past four years through our continuous monitoring campaign ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also section [ subsec : atmosphere ] ) .",
    "our analysis indicates that site conditions are suitable for a first - generation ground - based thz facility .",
    "therefore , we mainly target the glt in this paper , noting that the thz science cases will likely be similar or even common for all the first - generation thz telescopes except for their sky coverages .",
    "this paper also provides a first basis for ground - based thz observations for later generations of telescopes with larger dishes , such as the initially proposed cerro chajnantor atacama telescope ( ccat ) or any successor project . with a diameter twice as large as the glt",
    ", these telescopes will have even better sensitivity and resolution to further push the scientific results achieved by the glt .",
    "one of the major scientific advantages of the thz regime is that thermal dust continuum emission will be measured around its peak in the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "moreover , the angular resolution ( 4@xmath4 at 1.5 thz for the diffraction - limited primary beam ) enables us to spatially resolve the individual star - formation sites within nearby molecular clouds , typically located within a distance of @xmath5300 pc ( section [ subsubsec : thz_sf ] ) .",
    "this high resolution is also an advantage for extragalactic observations where star - formation activities within nearby galaxies will be resolved .",
    "( section [ subsec : extragal ] ) .",
    "we emphasize that a resolution of @xmath6 is comparable to what is achieved with submm interferometers such as the submillimeter array ( sma ; @xcite ) , although alma can have a substantially better spatial resolution .",
    "no thz facility , including non - ground - based observatories , has ever routinely had such a resolution for imaging . for dust continuum ,",
    "combining submm interferometric data with new 1.5 thz data will significantly improve dust temperature estimates .",
    "a wealth of interesting but unexplored emission lines are also in the thz windows ( section [ subsec : line ] ) .",
    "highly exited rotational molecular lines ( e.g. , co , hcn ) will probe `` extremely hot '' ( 300500 k ) molecular regions , which have been missed in observations at longer wavelengths .",
    "line profiles will reveal gas motions in these regions .",
    "additional lines accessible in the thz windows will be groups of atomic fine - structure lines tracing diffuse transitional regions in the interstellar medium ( ism ) from ionized or atomic gas to molecular gas , and pure rotational lines ( e.g. , ch ) tracing chemically basic light molecules .    in summary ,",
    "the thz frequencies are suitable for tracing some key chemical species in gas and solid materials often associated with star - formation activities .",
    "therefore , the grand aim of thz science is to trace the processes in the ism that lead to star formation ( see section [ sec : key ] for more detailed discussion ) .",
    "since the weather conditions necessary for thz observations are only realized for a small fraction of the winter time ( typically @xmath7% ; section [ subsec : glt ] ) , it is worth considering `` sub - thz '' observations as well ( section [ sec : subthz ] ) .",
    "some survey observations in the 850 ghz and 650 ghz windows can be unique for thz telescopes , because these relatively high - frequency submm bands still remain difficult to be fully explored at those sites where the current submm telescopes are located .",
    "we will also discuss the possibility of flexible scheduling of observing time , because the glt will be capable of doing this .",
    "one of the largest advantages of such flexible time allocations is that we will be able to execute time - consuming surveys",
    ". we will also allocate monitoring and target - of - opportunity ( too ) observations . in the field of very - high - energy ( vhe )",
    "phenomena , thz continuum observations can help to constrain the mechanism and region of origin of the vhe in active galactic nuclei ( agns ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) ( section [ sec : monitoring ] ) .",
    "in particular , current multi - frequency monitoring campaigns from optical to x- and gamma - rays lack observations at thz or sub - thz frequencies for a complete sed to constrain the underlying physics of the origin of vhe .",
    "thz continuum observations will provide clean measurements of the source intensity , without being affected by scintillation and extinction .    in this paper , we aim at exploring the scientific importance of ground - based thz observations , providing some quantitative estimates . for clarification , we focus on the glt as one of the first - generation ground - based facilities , but the scientific discussions are general enough to be applied to any 10-m class thz telescope . this paper is organized as follows : we start by describing the features of the glt as an example of future first - generation thz telescopes in section [ sec : glt ] .",
    "we discuss the key thz science cases in section [ sec : key ] , and some sub - thz cases in section [ sec : subthz ] .",
    "we also describe some science cases that are making maximal use of a flexible time allocation in section [ sec : monitoring ] .",
    "based on the science cases discussed in this paper , we also summarize possible developments of future instruments in section [ sec : development ] .",
    "finally , we give a summary in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "we use @xmath8 for the cosmological parameters .",
    "as emphasized above , the scope of this paper is not limited to a specific future project , but rather evaluating quantitatively some key science cases suitable for the first - generation ground - based thz telescopes . here",
    ", we introduce the glt as a typical telescope for this purpose , only to make clear what kind of capabilities would be expected in the near future for thz observations .",
    "we refer the interested reader to @xcite and @xcite for the details of specifications and possible instruments for the glt .",
    "we also emphasize that , by considering the `` realistic '' case of the glt , we will be able to extract the important aspects and requirements in performing ground - based observations . indeed , as we demonstrate below , the following advantages of the glt are of fundamental importance in realizing ground - based thz observations : ( i ) atmospheric transmission ( in the winter time , the atmospheric condition is statistically better than the mauna kea site @xcite , and comparable to the alma site ) ; ( ii ) stability of the atmospheric condition ( in the winter time , there is no daylight and only minor daily temperature variations , so that the weather condition suitable for thz observations can last @xmath3 a day ) ; ( iii ) flexible scheduling ( except for the time occupied by the vlbi observations , the glt can be used as a dedicated telescope for thz observations ) . in",
    "what follows , we will show that the glt really has these advantages that are fundamentally important to the success of ground - based thz observations .",
    "the glt is an alma  north - american 12-m vertex prototype antenna @xcite that is being retrofitted to arctic conditions , with the goal of deploying it to the greenland summit station at an altitude of 3,200 m ( located at latitude 7257n and longitude 3846w ) .",
    "primary operating conditions for the glt  defined as extending over 90% of the weather conditions  cover an ambient temperature down to @xmath9c , wind speeds of up to 11 m s@xmath10 and a vertical temperature gradient ( due to an inversion layer over the greenlandic plateau ) of @xmath11 k over the antenna height from bottom to top .",
    "furthermore , an ambient temperature change rate of up to 2 k hr@xmath10 is taken into account .",
    "absolute ( non - repeatable ) pointing errors of 2with a final goal of 14 are targeted for primary conditions , together with offset pointing and tracking errors of 06 and a final 04 .",
    "an antenna surface accuracy of 10  @xmath1 m is targeted . for thz observations around 1.5  thz",
    "this yields an antenna surface efficiency of about 65% .",
    "this efficiency will drop to 40% and 20% for 15  @xmath1 m and 20  @xmath1 m surface accuracies .",
    "secondary operating conditions  additionally covering the 9095% range of weather occurrence ",
    "extend the ambient temperature further down to @xmath12c and the wind speeds up to 13 m s@xmath10 .",
    "a degraded antenna performance is accepted under these conditions .",
    "the exceptionally dry atmospheric conditions at this site are suitable for submm and even for fir ( thz ) observations ( section [ subsec : atmosphere ] ) .",
    "the principal purpose of the glt is to provide a submm - vlbi station that can be correlated with other telescopes such as the sma , the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) , and alma in order to achieve extremely long intercontinental baselines @xcite .",
    "this will greatly enhance the angular resolution at submm wavelengths .",
    "the key scientific goal of this interferometry is to measure the shadow caused by the strong gravitational field around the central supermassive black hole in m87 .",
    "this project will provide a unique opportunity to study the strong general relativistic effects immediately surrounding the black hole s event horizon .",
    "related scientific topics include measuring the black hole spin in m87 , constraining the nature of its accretion flow and determining the launching mechanism of its relativistic jet .",
    "additional science cases are the very high energy emission in agns and the exploration of dark energy through high - precision measurements of locations and velocities of maser spots in galaxies .",
    "the glt will likely be used for vlbi observations only during a short period within each year ( roughly 12 months ) , because many telescopes must be made available simultaneously .",
    "therefore , we expect that a significant fraction of observing time can be used for single - dish observations .",
    "below , we describe the capability of the glt as a single - dish telescope .      in 2011 , we deployed a radiometer to greenland to monitor the sky and weather conditions at the summit station @xcite .",
    "the average temperature is low at around @xmath1330 to @xmath14c , down to @xmath15c in winter .",
    "because of such low ambient temperatures , the water content in the air is exceedingly low .",
    "every 10 minutes , a tipping measurement is performed to take opacity data .",
    "the measured 225 ghz atmospheric opacity as a function of time is shown in figure [ fig : transmission].the corresponding histogram together with its cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) is depicted in figure [ fig : histogram ] .",
    "we confirmed that the opacities lower quartile in these months can get as low as 0.047 , with occasional opacities as low as 0.030 in the winter regime ( november to april ; see also the zoomed plots in figure [ fig : transmission ] ) .",
    "based on the monitoring opacity ( @xmath16 ) data at 225 ghz , we estimated the precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) , and then converted that into an atmospheric opacity at 1.5 thz using the `` _ am _ '' program and climatological data from summit camp for temperature , relative humidity and ozone profiles @xcite . for convenience ,",
    "we give the conversion formula between @xmath16 and pwv in figure [ fig : transmission ] .",
    "the observational rate with thz opacity ( @xmath17 ) condition less than 2.0 and 3.0 were 1.8% and 11.4% in the winter regime ( november to april ) .",
    "these fractions are similar to those expected for the alma site ( 2.0% for @xmath18 and 16.8% for @xmath19 ) in the winter season @xcite .",
    "it is noteworthy that thz opacity conditions giving @xmath19 can last from a few hours to half a day in many cases . in some cases , they last up to 37 days ( see figure [ fig : transmission]a ,",
    "b ) , which is only possible in the polar regions where there is no daylight in the winter time . if we focus on the months when such long durations of thz weather are achieved , the statistics of atmorpheric opacity at the greenland summit site are as good as at the antarctic site",
    ". we also estimated the opacity condition less than 0.6 and 1.0 at sub - thz bands .",
    "those were 8.2% and 32.9% at 675 ghz and 3.9% and 24.2% at 875 ghz , respectively .     and the pwv ( in units of mm ) was calculated with _ am _",
    "@xcite , and expressed as @xmath20 ( valid in october  may for @xmath21 ) or @xmath22 ( valid in june ",
    "september for @xmath23 ) .",
    "* , scaledwidth=43.0% ]    .",
    "the blue line and shaded histogram show the statistics in the summer months ( may  october ) while the red line and white histogram present the statistics in the winter months ( november  april ) .",
    "* , scaledwidth=45.0% ]    @xcite have presented the atmospheric conditions at various sites suitable for submm astronomy using satellite data , including greenland . however , their data do not have a time resolution of less than @xmath5 a day , while time variations within a day are important for thz observations . moreover , at the polar sites , the statistics focusing on the winter season is meaningful because the night continues over the whole winter period .",
    "we , therefore , think that our new opacity statistics is more reliable for the thz observing conditions .",
    "although dome a in antarctica would be better than the greenland summit station , the glt can play a unique role because it is still the best site in the northern hemisphere .",
    "in other words , the glt and telescopes in antarctica are complementary in their sky coverages .",
    "we emphasize that the science cases discussed in this paper are applicable to any thz telescope with a different fraction of time suitable for thz observations , as long as we adopt the same criterion for the thz weather ( @xmath18 or 3.0 ) .",
    "the expected observational performance of the glt at the frequencies of atmospheric windows is summarized in table  [ tab : capability ] , which is revised from @xcite , for the frequency range of interest in this paper ( 3501,500 ghz ) . for this calculation",
    ", we assume the surface accuracy to be 15 @xmath1 m .",
    "indeed , the telescope was demonstrated to have a surface accuracy of 16 @xmath1 m when it was at the evaluation phase as the alma prototype antenna @xcite . using the best 10% and median opacity conditions for the frequencies lower than 1 thz and the best 1.5% and the best 10% opacity conditions for the frequency higher than 1 thz at the winter season and the expected receiver performance ( i.e. , receiver temperature @xmath24 ) , we estimated the system temperature ( @xmath25 ) for each frequency band , and corresponding continuum noise equivalent flux density for 1 second integration ( nefd ) and spectral nefd for 1 km s@xmath10 resolution .",
    "[ tab : capability ]    note : this table is an updated version of @xcite ; in this paper , we used the up - to - date opacity statistics mentioned in the previous subsection .",
    "opacity , @xmath25 , and nefds are given for two cases : the best 10% and median ( in parenthesis ) weather for the frequency lower than 1 thz , and the best 1.5% and the best 10% ( in parenthesis ) for the frequency higher than 1 thz .",
    "both cases are based on the opacity statistics of the winter season ( from november to april ) .    in practice",
    ", we typically consider to observe the sky area with a zenith angle @xmath26 . with the latitude of the site , @xmath27 , therefore , we limit the declination to @xmath28 .",
    "the advantage of ground - based observations is that we can use a large telescope . as shown in section [ subsec : capability ] , the angular resolution achieved is about 4at 1.5 thz for a 10-m class ground - based telescope , while the diffraction limit of a 3.5-m - class space telescope , such as _ herschel _ , is @xmath29around 1.5 thz .",
    "thus , the obvious new parameter space to be explored by ground - based thz facilities is the angular resolution with an improvement of about an order of magnitude in beam area . in particular , no thz facility has ever routinely had such a resolution for imaging .",
    "additional advantages are : ( i ) we can directly control and maintain the telescope ; and ( ii ) we can run long - term projects which is difficult for non - ground - based facilities with limited lifetimes or limited observational durations .    as far as sensitivity is concerned , ground - based facilities can not win over airborne or space telescopes even at the summit station in greenland because of the atmospheric opacity .",
    "for example , a @xmath530 times smaller continuum nefd is achieved by the currently available airborne facility , sofia .",
    "therefore , the first - generation ground - based thz telescopes need to focus on relatively bright objects where high - angular - resolution observations have the potential to do pioneering work .      since the weather conditions suitable for thz observations are not guaranteed for all the winter time ( typically @xmath7% ; section [ subsec : atmosphere ] ) , operations at somewhat lower frequencies should also be considered . in order to be different from existing submm telescopes",
    ", we are taking advantage of the good atmospheric conditions to target relatively high frequencies , referred to as sub - thz in this paper .",
    "in particular , atmospheric windows around 850 ghz ( 350 @xmath1 m ) and 650 ghz ( 450 @xmath1 m ) are viable targets .",
    "operations at submm / millimeter ( mm)-wavelength sites like mauna kea have been rare in these frequency bands . the greenland site will provide a significant fraction of time ( section [ subsec : atmosphere ] ) for these windows . therefore , the second purpose of this paper is to identify compelling science cases in the shortest submm or sub - thz ranges .",
    "a special advantage of the glt is that it allows for flexible time scheduling .",
    "time - consuming survey - type observations at sub - thz will be unique , because such observations are extremely difficult for practically all other telescopes in the northern hemisphere .",
    "this flexibility increases the chance to carry out monitoring and target - of - opportunity ( too ) observations .",
    "the scientific importance of this possibility is also explored in this paper .",
    "in the thz regime there are a number of interesting but unexplored spectral lines , which should be useful for studies of the ism and star formation . in line observations ,",
    "sky background subtraction is much easier than in continuum observations , and thus observations of intense thz lines should be the starting point of our thz astronomical experiment .",
    "table [ tab : lines ] summarizes representative thz lines whose rest - frame wavelengths are accessible in the thz atmospheric windows .",
    "these lines can be classified into three categories ; ( i ) very high-@xmath30 ( @xmath30 is the rotational excitation state ) molecular lines ( co , hco@xmath31 , and hcn ) ; ( ii ) atomic fine - structure lines ( [ n ii ] ) ; and ( iii ) pure rotational lines of light molecules ( h@xmath32d@xmath31 , hd@xmath32@xmath31 , and ch ) .",

    "they detected some regions with such a high excitation along the ridge of omc-1 .",
    "it has been clarified that there are some warm regions with kinetic temperatures @xmath34130 k and hydrogen number density @xmath35 @xmath36 in the molecular cloud .",
    "they also emphasized the importance of high angular resolutions achieved by ground - based telescopes in specifying the locations of the emission .    with the glt",

    "the starbursts in bcds are relatively isolated in that the star formation occurs only in compact central regions and the rest of the galaxy is quiescent .",
    "therefore , if we observe nearby bcds , we can investigate the detailed properties of starbursts by isolating the relevant star - forming regions without being contaminated ( or bothered ) by other star - forming regions .",
    "another scientific merit of observing bcds ( or dwarf galaxies in general ) is that we can collect a sample with a wide metallicity rage .",

    "in addition to the target - of - opportunity mode for @xmath287-ray bursts already discussed in another paper by @xcite , we discussed a possibility of monitoring blasars , which are strongly time - variable ( section [ subsec : agn ] ) .",
    "the collaboration with submm very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) is interesting : if an interesting event is detected in the single - dish observation , a submm vlbi observation mode is triggered .",
    "this is a unique science case that connects the vlbi and single dish modes .",
    "we should also emphasize that the submm ( or thz ) emission traces synchrotron emission , which gives constraints on magnetic field strengths . as a consequence",
    ", we can address the dynamical properties in which magnetic fields play a central role ( e.g. , collimation ) .      for category ( a ) ,",
    "because of the diffuse nature of the ism , a multi - pixel detector is strongly favored .",
    "the current status of development of thz detectors was described in section [ subsec : thzreceiver ] .",
    "targetting the 1.5 thz window rather than the 1.0 thz window is better because interesting lines exist ( section [ subsec : line ] ) , and the separation from already explored submm wavelengths is larger ( section [ subsec : cont ] ) . for category ( b ) , a large submm detector array is required .",
    "multi - band detectors are preferred , considering dust temperature determination .",
    "the uniqueness of the glt site is the good atmospheric condition so that relatively high frequencies referred to as sub - thz ( @xmath5850 ghz and @xmath5650 ghz ) are preferred to make the maximum use of this uniqueness .",
    "these frequencies also have an advantage that they are also covered by _",
    "herschel _ ; i.e. , the _ herschel _ catalog or survey data can be utilized as input .",
    "for category ( c ) , no particular detector capabilities are required .",
    "thus , for the glt , we can simply use the mm / submm detectors developed for the vlbi observations .",
    "flexibility of time allocation should be kept if we want to pursue this category .",
    "we are grateful to the anonymous referee for useful comments and r. blundell and s. paine for continuous support .",

    "we examine how useful adding thz data is to determine the dust temperature .",
    "we assume that the dust emission is optically thin , which is valid for the objects of interest in this paper .",
    "we adopt a power - law wavelength dependence of the mass absorption coefficient ( @xmath391 ) of dust at thz frequencies .",
    "then , the flux at frequency @xmath193 is written as @xmath392 where @xmath393 is the normalizing constant , which is proportional to the dust mass multiplied by @xmath391 [ see the footnote for equation ( [ eq : f_comp ] ) ] , and @xmath394 is the planck function . in principle , it is possible to determine both @xmath395 and @xmath396 if we have data at three or more wavelengths ( since @xmath393 is also unknown ) .",
    "however , as shown by @xcite , errors as small as @xmath168% is required to determine both .",
    "thus , we fix @xmath397 @xcite .",
    "since we focus on the goodness of temperature estimate , the value of @xmath395 chosen does not affect our conclusion .",
    "we survey a larger range of @xmath396 than @xcite , since we target objects with a wide dust temperature range .",
    "our focus is also different from theirs in that we emphasize the importance of thz frequencies ; in particular , we include frequencies @xmath3850 ghz or wavelengths @xmath157350 @xmath1 m into our analysis .",
    "first , we add random noise to the flux calculated by equation ( [ eq : grey ] ) and produce `` observed fluxes '' at a few given wavelengths .",
    "next , based on these artificially made observed fluxes , we estimate the dust temperature . this estimated dust temperature is compared with the input dust temperature to examine",
    "how precisely we can obtain the dust temperature .",
    "to realize this procedure , we run the following monte carlo simulations :    1 .   with a certain value of @xmath396 , we produce @xmath398 at given frequencies .",
    "note that the value of @xmath393 does not affect the temperature estimate so we fix @xmath393 .",
    "the given dust temperature is denoted as @xmath151 .",
    "for the same value of @xmath151 , we produce thirty realizations according to the following processes .",
    "2 .   we add a random independent error to @xmath398 at each frequency .",
    "the percentage of the error @xmath399 is chosen randomly between @xmath400 and @xmath401 with @xmath402% chosen unless otherwise stated .",
    "the data with the error is denoted as @xmath403 .",
    "we fit @xmath404 at all the wavelengths with equation ( [ eq : grey ] ) with two free parameters ( @xmath393 and @xmath396 ) by minimizing the sum of the squares of logarithmic difference .",
    "the obtained dust temperature is denoted as @xmath405 , which is compared with the input dust temperature , @xmath151 .",
    "we examine the following four sets of wavelengths in units of @xmath1 m : ( 200 , 450 , 850 ) , ( 300 , 450 , 850 ) , ( 450 , 850 ) and ( 200 , 300 ) .",
    "the first and second cases are compared to judge which of the thz atmospheric windows , 200 @xmath1 m ( 1.5 thz ) or 300 @xmath1 m ( 1.0 thz ) , in addition to often used submm wavelengths ( 450 and 850 @xmath1 m ) , is useful to obtain precise dust temperatures .",
    "the third case represents the case where we only have submm observations .",
    "the last is for the case with only thz observations .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tdust_err ] , we show the comparison between the input dust temperature @xmath151 and the obtained dust temperature @xmath405 . comparing the wavelength sets of ( 200 , 450 , 850 ) and ( 450 , 850 ) shown in figures [ fig : tdust_err]a and c , respectively , we find that the addition of 200 @xmath1 m improves the dust temperature estimate significantly , especially for the range of dust temperature typical of normal spiral galaxies ( 1530 k ) .",
    "this confirms the conclusion drawn by @xcite that adding a data point at a short wavelength ( in their case , 350 @xmath1 m ) improves the dust temperature estimate . comparing figures [ fig : tdust_err]a and b",
    ", we find that 200 @xmath1 m rather than 300 @xmath1 m is preferable to suppress the error at 2040 k ; this is because adding a wavelength farther from the submm wavelengths is more effective .",
    "therefore , the addition of a thz frequency to submm frequencies actually improves the dust temperature estimate and the 1.5 thz ( 200 @xmath1 m ) band rather than the 1.0 thz band ( 300 @xmath1 m ) is preferable .",
    "the temperature estiamtes with only two thz bands ( figure [ fig : tdust_err]d ) is not as good as the combination of a single thz band and submm bands ( figure [ fig : tdust_err]a ) .",
    "this is because the wavelengths of the two thz bands are too close .",
    "therefore , the best scenario is that , in addition to a thz data point , we have multiple submm data with currently available submm interferometers whose angular resolution at submm is comparable to or better than that in the thz bands .    in the above",
    ", we assumed conservatively large errors .",
    "we expect that , if we increase the number of data points , the temperature estimate becomes more precise . in reality , because of the limited atmospheric window , we can not increase the number of data points arbitrarily , but rather we can increase the integration time or the band width within technical constraints .",
    "this leads to an improvement in the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "therefore , it is worth examining the effects of signal - to - noise ratio ( or error ) on the dust temperature estimate .    in figure",
    "[ fig : tdust_450_850 ] , we show three cases for various errors @xmath406 : 30% ( same as figure [ fig : tdust_err]c ) , 10% and 3% .",
    "we observe that , if the measurement error is very small , we can get a precise dust temperatures for @xmath407 k. yet , if we add a thz data point with an error @xmath15710% , the temperature estimate at @xmath158 k is much improved .",
    "finally , we also examine the effect of errors on the temperature determination only by the two thz bands in figure [ fig : tdust_200_300 ] . as already shown in figure [ fig : tdust_err ] ,",
    "if the errors are as large as 30% , we can not obtain precise values . to obtain a precise enough dust temperature",
    ", we need very precise measurements whose typical errors are @xmath408% .",
    "therefore , we recommend to combine thz observations with submm data obtained by existing submm interferometers ."

    "<S> thus , high - resolution mapping is an important scientific argument . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , we can isolate zones of interest for galactic and extragalactic star - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> the thz windows are suitable for observations of high - excitation co lines and [ n ii ] 205 @xmath1 m lines , which are scientifically relevant tracers of star formation and stellar feedback . </S>",
    "<S> those lines are the brightest lines in the thz windows , so that they are suitable for the initiation of ground - based thz observations . </S>",
    "<S> thz polarization of star - forming regions can also be explored since it traces the dust population contributing to the thz spectral peak . for survey - type observations , we focus on `` sub - thz '' extragalactic surveys , </S>",
    "<S> whose uniqueness is to detect galaxies at redshifts @xmath22 , where the dust emission per comoving volume is the largest in the history of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> finally we explore possibilities of flexible time scheduling , which enables us to monitor active galactic nuclei , and to target gamma - ray burst afterglows . for these objects , thz and submillimeter wavelength ranges </S>",
    "<S> have not yet been explored . </S>"
