    "a simple atomic system in its liquid state is a prototypical strongly coupled system with no small expansion parameters available to simplify calculations . under conditions where classical mechanics is applicable",
    "there are a number of theoretical and computational methods available to address such strong coupling conditions .",
    "these include integral equation and density functional methods , and numerical techniques such as molecular dynamics ( md ) and monte carlo ( mc ) simulation . for quantum systems",
    "there are complementary many - body methods to address the new features of diffraction and exchange or degeneracy effects",
    ". conditions of both quantum degeneracy and strong coupling pose challenging problems with few choices for accurate computation of properties sensitive to both features ( e.g. , diffusion and path integral monte carlo ( pimc ) simulation ) .",
    "one approach to describe such quantum systems is to extend the classical methods in a phenomenological way .",
    "for example , md has been used with effective potentials modified to include short range diffraction effects @xcite . a related approach , wave packet md , uses a similar variant of classical mechanics to define trajectories guiding wave - packets .",
    "an interesting new approach is to use classical integral equations for pair correlations modified to include an effective potential and an effective temperature dharma00 .",
    "quantum effects are imbedded in these effective properties , while strong correlations are generated by the classical form of the integral equation . a surprisingly wide class of quantum systems",
    "have been described in this way with considerable success @xcite .",
    "the objective here is to formalize the exploitation of classical methods by defining a classical statistical mechanics whose equilibrium properties are the same as those for an underlying quantum system .",
    "the exact definition is given in the next section , providing the basis for the introduction of practical approximations .",
    "one simple realization of electron gas as a classical system is described in the following sections .",
    "the emphasis here is on the definition of the mapping and its approximate evaluation .",
    "applications will be described elsewhere .",
    "consider for simplicity a one component system at equilibrium represented in the grand canonical ensemble .",
    "the grand potential @xmath0 is proportional to the pressure and is given by@xmath1here @xmath2 denotes a trace over properly symmetrized @xmath3 particle states .",
    "the thermodynamics for the system is specified as functions of the inverse temperature @xmath4 and functionals of the local chemical potential @xmath5 ( an external potential has been included for generality ) and pair potential @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath7 contains the kinetic energy @xmath8 and sum over pair potentials : @xmath9 .",
    "a corresponding classical system is considered with hamiltonian @xmath10 in the same volume @xmath11 at equilibrium described by the classical grand canonical ensemble , with inverse temperature @xmath12 and local chemical potential @xmath13 .",
    "the hamiltonian has the same form except the potential energy functions @xmath14 and @xmath15 are different .",
    "the classical grand potential is defined in terms of these quantities by@xmath16here , @xmath17 is the thermal de broglie wavelength associated with the classical temperature .",
    "the integration for the partition function is taken over the @xmath3 particle configuration space .",
    "the classical system has undefined ingredients : the effective inverse temperature , @xmath18 , the local chemical potential , @xmath19 , and the pair potential for interaction among the particles , @xmath14 .",
    "a correspondence between the classical and quantum systems is defined by expressing these quantities as functions or functionals of @xmath4 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "this is accomplished by requiring the numerical equivalence of two independent thermodynamic properties and one structural property .",
    "the first two are chosen to be the equivalence of the grand potential and its first functional derivative with respect to the local chemical potential .",
    "@xmath22an equivalent form for these conditions can be given in terms of the pressure and density@xmath23these two relations provide two independent relations between @xmath18 , @xmath24 and the physical variables @xmath4 and @xmath25 .",
    "it remains to have a structural equivalence to relate the pair potential @xmath14 to @xmath26 , which are two particle functions .",
    "this is accomplished by equating the functional derivatives of the grand potentials with respect to these pair potentials@xmath27an equivalent form for this definition is the equivalence of pair correlation functions@xmath28 in this way the three equations of ( [ 2.5 ] ) and ( [ 2.7 ] ) determine , formally , the classical parameters @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 as functions of @xmath32 and functionals of @xmath25 , and @xmath33 : @xmath34 .",
    "this completes the definition of the thermodynamics of a classical system that is representative of that for a given quantum system .",
    "it is also possible to deduce from this a classical density functional theory that is representative of the quantum density functional theory .",
    "this will be discussed elsewhere .",

    "it remains to find an equivalent expression for @xmath18 .",
    "this is obtained from the first definition of ( [ 2.5 ] ) and the classical virial equation for the pressure , which has the form @xmath44 \\rightarrow \\mathcal{k}% \\left [ \\beta _ { c}\\mu _ { c},\\beta _ { c}\\phi _ { c},g\\right ] .",

    "an interesting first illustration of this correspondence of classical and quantum system is the uniform ideal fermi gas .",
    "the quantum description of this non - interacting system with only exchange effects is of course simple to analyze .",
    "however , the corresponding classical system is a true many - body problem since those same effects translate into a pair potential among all particles @xcite .",
    "the full many - body problem must be solved to find that effective potential . here",
    "that problem is addressed in terms of the approximate hnc integral equation .",
    "only the results will be given . in figure",
    "( * 1a * ) the classical pair potential is shown as a function of @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the thermal de broglie wavelength defined in terms of the quantum @xmath4 .",
    "a family of curves is given for different values of the degeneracy parameter @xmath52 for the quantum system .",
    "of interest is the development of long range @xmath53 behavior as the temperature is lowered ( large z ) . for this reason the mapping to a classical system requires a uniform neutralizing background to cancel this divergent behavior .",
    "the classical temperature is determined from the virial equation , with @xmath54 defined as above from the hnc integral equation .",
    "this is shown in figure ( * 1b * ) . as expected for @xmath55 while @xmath56 approaches a finite value for @xmath35 .",
    "it is interesting to note that while the pressures of the classical and quantum systems are the same by definition , the internal energies are the same as well .",
    "however , this is true only if the internal energy is defined thermodynamically and not mechanically .",
