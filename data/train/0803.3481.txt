    "a key to understanding the formation of planetary systems lies in characterizing the transitional phase between the gas - rich primordial disks found around young t tauri stars and the tenuous , virtually gas - free debris disks around their main - sequence counterparts .",
    "unfortunately , disks in this transitional phase are rare and difficult to identify . dust disks around young stars are commonly identified through the `` vega - excess '' phenomenon ( first observed using the infrared astronomical satellite by @xcite ; see review by @xcite ) , in which an infared excess over the stellar photosphere is attributed to reprocessing of optical and ultraviolet starlight by thermally emitting circumstellar dust grains .",
    "49 ceti was first identified in this way by @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath3 is often used as an indicator of the `` optical depth '' of the dust disk , as it provides a rough estimate of the quantity of optical / ultraviolet light intercepted and reemitted by the dust . @xcite correlated the iras point source catalog with the yale bright star catalog @xcite and identified three a stars with @xmath4 , indicative of tenuous , optically thin circumstellar dust .",
    "two were the stars @xmath5 pic and hr4796 , which are now known to host debris disks .",
    "the third was 49 ceti , which unlike the other two defies classification as a debris disk because it retains a substantial quantity of molecular gas , first observed in the co j=2 - 1 line @xcite and later confirmed in j=3 - 2 @xcite . at a distance of only 61 pc ( hipparcos ) ,",
    "it is one of the closest known gas - rich circumstellar disks , farther only than tw hydrae ( 51pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "its outward similarity to a debris disk , combined with the substantial quantity of molecular gas still present in the system , suggest that the disk may be in an unusual transitional evolutionary phase .",
    "all three high-@xmath6 a stars are young : hr 4796a has an age of @xmath7 myr @xcite and @xmath5 pic has been placed at @xmath8 myr by @xcite , consistent with the age determination of @xmath9 myr by @xcite .",
    "the age of 49 ceti is uncertain due to its isolation ; unlike @xmath5 pic or hr 4796a there are no known associated low - mass stars to provide a corroborating age estimate .",
    "@xcite demonstrate that on an hr diagram , all three stars exhibit a low luminosity for their color , which is likely attributable to their young ages ( @xmath10  myr ) .",
    "using the evolutionary tracks of @xcite , @xcite assign an age of 7.8  myr to 49 ceti based on its position on the hr diagram .",
    "few conclusive measurements have been made of the dust properties in the 49 ceti system .",
    "hst / nicmos coronographic observations of 49 ceti failed to detect any scattered light in the near infrared at @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "recent subarcsecond - scale imaging at mid - infrared wavelengths with keck @xcite revealed dust emission at 12.5 and 17.9 @xmath12 m , extended along a nw - se axis and apparently inclined at an angle of @xmath13 .",
    "simple models of the dust emission suggest a radial size segregation of dust grains , with a population of very small grains ( @xmath14 m ) confined between 30 and 60 au from the star , and a population of larger grains ( @xmath15 m ) from 60 to 900 au from the star . however , the outer radius of this latter component is uncertain due to its dependence on the millimeter flux , which is not well determined .",
    "there are two contradictory single dish measurements of the millimeter dust emission , both with modest signal - to - noise .",
    "@xcite report a iram 1.2  mm flux of @xmath16 mjy , while @xcite report a jcmt / scuba 850 @xmath12 m flux of @xmath17 mjy .",
    "these measurements are mutually inconsistent for either a thermal spectrum ( @xmath18 ) or a typical optically thin circumstellar disk spectrum ( @xmath19 ) in this wavelength regime .    if we accept the lower value of the 850 @xmath12 m flux and make standard assumptions about the dust opacity ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the total mass of the 49 ceti dust disk is 0.1 m@xmath20 .",
    "if we compare this to other nearby dusty disks at potentially similar stages of evolution , we find that 49 ceti , with an 850 @xmath12 m flux of 8.2 mjy at a distance of 61 pc , has a dust mass ( @xmath21 ) approximately 80% that of @xmath5 pic ( 104.3 mjy , 19.3 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but only 0.3% that of the typical herbig ae star hd 169142 ( 554 mjy , 145 pc ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus the 49 ceti disk appears to have a tenuous dust disk more akin to that of the debris disk around @xmath5 pic than a gas - rich protoplanetary disk .",
    "studies of the distribution of gas in the 49 ceti system have been similarly inconclusive , particularly since it is not obvious that a substantial reservoir of molecular gas should persist in the strong uv field of an a star at this apparently advanced stage .",
    "attempts to detect pure rotational transitions of the h@xmath22 molecule have resulted in contradictory reports , with @xcite reporting a marginal detection using sws / iso , which @xcite did not confirm with spitzer / irs observations ; nor did @xcite detect h@xmath22 emission with vlt / crires observations .",
    "models of the double - peaked jcmt co j=3 - 2 line profile observed by @xcite indicated that the gas is likely distributed in either a very compact disk with @xmath23 inclination or a more inclined ring of radius @xmath24 au and inclination @xmath25 .",
    "the latter was deemed more consistent with the dust distribution seen in the mid - infrared , although it fails to reproduce the high - velocity wings that may be present in the co j=3 - 2 line profile .    in order to obtain spatially",
    "resolved information on the distribution of material in the system , we observed 49 ceti with the submillimeter array in the j=2 - 1 transition of co and associated continuum .",
    "we detect a rotating structure of much greater extent than predicted from the single - dish measurements , with a large central region devoid of molecular gas emission .",
    "we also model the disk emission using costar @xcite , a code that combines thin hydrostatic equilibrium models of disks with a rich chemistry network and a detailed heating and cooling balance to determine gas properties .",
    "the models provide some insight into basic properties of the disk , including the region of photodissociation of co in the inner disk and the spatial extent of the emission .",

    "[ sec : sed ] discusses the dust properties in the context of the spectral energy distribution predicted from the gas model .",
    "the best - fit model is discussed in  [ sec : best ] , including an a posteriori comparison of the model prediction with the observed co j=3 - 2 spectrum ; inadequacies of the model are also noted .",
    "the results are discussed in the broader context of disk evolution in  [ sec : dis ] , and a summary is presented in  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we observed 49 ceti with the sma at 230 ghz during an 11-hour track on the night of october 13 , 2006 .",
    "atmospheric phase was extremely stable , with typical phase changes of @xmath26 between calibrator scans ( every 25 minutes ) .",
    "seven antennas were used in the `` extended '' configuration , with projected baselines between 15 and 130 meters .",
    "the primary flux calibrator was uranus , and the passband calibrators were the quasars 3c454.3 and j0530 + 135 .",
    "gain calibration was carried out using the quasar j0132 - 169 , located just 1.3@xmath27 from 49 ceti ; the flux derived for this quasar was 0.93 jy .",
    "the nearby quasar j0006 - 063 was also included to test the quality of the phase transfer from j0132 - 169 .",
    "two 2-ghz sidebands separated by 10 ghz were used , yielding a continuum sensitivity of 0.7 mjy ( 1@xmath28 ) .",
    "spectral resolution in the line was 0.26 km / s , subsequently binned to 2.1 km / s , with rms sensitivity 0.030 jy in a single 2.1 km / s channel .",
    "the lsr velocities were converted to heliocentric using an offset of -9.14 km / s . the synthesized naturally weighted beam in the co j=2 - 1 line was 10@xmath012 , at a position angle of -78.6@xmath27 .",

    "the contour colors indicate heliocentric line - of - sight velocity ; the four distinct velocities shown are 9.0 , 11.1 , 13.2 , and 15.3 km / s , in the order of bluest to reddest channel .",
    "no emission was detected outside this velocity range . ]",
    "figure [ fig : map ] shows the observed line emission from the region around 49 ceti .",
    "four velocity channels are shown , with the velocity indicated by the color of the contour lines .",
    "the observations are centered on the j2000 coordinates of 49 ceti ; the star symbol indicates the position corrected for the proper motion measured by _",
    "the maximum signal - to - noise ratio in the line is 8 .",
    "the co j=2 - 1 emission appears to be in an extended rotating structure of @xmath30 \" radius , apparently viewed close to edge - on .",
    "the symmetric distribution of the emission in the four velocity channels implies a heliocentric velocity near 12.2 km / s , consistent with previous determinations of the systemic velocity ( 10.5 and 9.9 km / s for the disk and the star , respectively ; see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "no emission is detected outside the range of velocities shown .",
    "the wide separation of the emission peaks , combined with a lack of compact , high - velocity emission , suggests that the central regions are clear of co j=2 - 1 emission out to @xmath3190  au radius ( @xmath3115 ) , twice that of the larger ring predicted from the co j=3 - 2 single dish data .",
    "table [ tab ] lists the observed parameters of the system .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : best ]    this model reproduces the basic features of the co j=2 - 1 emission well , including the strength of the emission , the separation of the emission peaks , and the spatial extent of the emission .",
    "there are still several important differences between the model and the data , however , including ( 1 ) an inability to reproduce the changes in position angle with radius evident in the data ( the `` wings '' of emission extending to the southeast and northwest of the position angle axis ) , and ( 2 ) the separation of the innermost , low - velocity channels",
    ". both of these may be indicative of departures from azimuthal symmetry in the disk structure , the former possibly indicating a warp in the disk and the latter apparently pointing to a deficit of emission along the minor axis of the disk . in none of our models",
    "were we able to reproduce the wide separation between the inner channels ; while the signal - to - noise ratio in these channels is low , the observed co morphology is difficult to reproduce in detail with a simple , azimuthally symmetric disk model .",
    "the co emission for this best - fit model is optically thin in both the j=2 - 1 and j=3 - 2 transitions , even for the edge - on disk orientation , and therefore traces the full column density of disk material .",
    "the densities in the disk are too low for efficient gas - dust coupling and thus the gas finds its own equilibrium temperature determined mainly by photoelectric heating and line cooling",
    ". the most important cooling lines from surface to midplane are [ cii ] , [ oi ] , and h@xmath22 .",
    "co abundances are only high in a region between 45 and 70  au ( fig .",
    "[ cooverview1 ] ) . outside that region",
    ", co cooling is less important for the energy balance . fig .  [ gastemp ] summarizes the most important heating and cooling processes and also shows the resulting gas temperature structure .",
    "the disk surface stays well below 100  k due to efficient fine structure line cooling .",
    "the molecular cooling is however less efficient in competing with the photoelectric heating from the large silicate grains @xcite , leading to temperatures of a few 100  k in the disk interior .",
    "m@xmath20 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 . shown",
    "are the most important heating ( top panel ) and cooling ( middle panel ) processes as well as the gas temperature ( bottom panel ) .",
    "the dust temperature , which depends only on radius , is overlaid in white contour lines ( steps of 10  k ) . ]    in order to test the robustness of the best - fit model to the gas properties , we used this model to predict the co j=3 - 2 spectrum .",
    "it compares favorably with the spectrum observed by @xcite , reproduced in figure  [ fig : spec ] .",
    "the heavy solid line shows the j=3 - 2 spectrum predicted from the best - fit disk model , while the light solid line shows the observed jcmt spectrum .",
    "although the observed spectrum is noisy and likely subject to an absolute calibration uncertainty , the overall agreement is within @xmath34% , which is very good given that the co j=3 - 2 spectrum was not used _ a priori _ to determine these model parameters .",
    "the processes determining the amount and distribution of gas and dust in transition disks like that around 49 ceti are the same processes that shape the features of emergent planetary systems around these young stars . resolved observations of individual disks in this phase are desirable to address such basic questions as when in the lifetime of a star its disk disperses , whether the gas clears before the dust , and whether the disk clears from the center or in a radially invariant manner .    in the 49 ceti system ,",
    "the infrared dust properties appear similar to those of a debris disk @xcite .",
    "yet observations presented here indicate that a substantial quantity of molecular gas persists in the outer disk , between radii of 40 and 200 au , where photochemistry from stellar and interstellar radiation dominates .",
    "the lack of molecular gas emission interior to this radius as indicated by our observations , combined with the lack of dust emission within a radius of 30 au inferred by @xcite , implies that the 49 ceti system appears to be clearing its gas and dust from the center out .",
    "the mechanism responsible for this central clearing is not indicated ; in general , the best - developed theories to explain this transitional morphology are ( 1 ) central clearing through the influence of a massive planet and ( 2 ) photoevaporation by radiation from the central star .    the clearing of gaps and inner holes has long been predicted as a consequence of the formation of massive planets in circumstellar disks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of 49 ceti",
    ", the formation of a jupiter - mass planet would be required at a distance of @xmath35 au from the star , roughly the inner radius of the observed hole in the gas distribution .",
    "such a scenario could also help to explain the size segregation of dust grains observed by @xcite ; a predicted consequence of inner disk clearing by gravitational influence of a massive planet is a filtration of dust grains by size , with only those below a certain threshold ( typically 1 - 10 @xmath12 m ) accreted across the gap along with a reduced amount of gas @xcite .",
    "however , this scenario ultimately requires the accretion of substantial amounts of gas into the inner disk , and searches for molecular gas in the inner disk of 49 ceti @xcite have not detected such a population . another indication that an inner hole is likely caused by a massive planet in formation would be non - axisymmetric features resulting from its gravitational influence , such as spiral waves .",
    "while the co emission from 49 ceti does not appear asymmetric within the limits of the sma observations , more sensitive spatially resolved observations could address this hypothesis .",
    "the absence of gas in the inner disk is , however , consistent with a photoevaporation scenario : as the photoevaporative wind produced by stellar radiation becomes comparable to the accretion rate in the disk , material within the gravitational radius @xmath36 will quickly drain onto the star , leaving an evacuated inner hole free of gas and dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the gravitational radius for 49 ceti is roughly 20 au , which is comparable to the inferred inner radius of 40 au for the outer disk .",
    "the larger outer radius may in fact be consistent with the later stages of photoevaporation , after the inner disk has become optically thin to ultraviolet radiation and the inner disk radius slowly increases under the influence of the photoevaporative wind @xcite .",
    "@xcite propose a method of discriminating between inner holes caused by photoevaporation and those caused by the formation of a giant planet , involving a simple comparison between two observables : the disk mass and the accretion rate .",
    "as there is no measured accretion rate for 49 ceti , we can not apply the criteria presented by these authors ; however , we note that the low disk mass does indeed fall within the parameter space consistent with a photoevaporative scenario .",
    "further observations are necessary to determine the origin of the inner hole ; in particular , stringent limits on the accretion rate could suggest a photoevaporative mechanism .",
    "there are few disks which appear to be in a similar evolutionary stage to that of 49 ceti ; a rare example is the disk around the a star hd 141569 . like 49 ceti ,",
    "it hosts a disk composed primarily of sub@xmath12m - size grains with infrared properties approaching those of a debris disk @xcite , while still retaining a substantial quantity of molecular gas with central region clear of gas emission , in this case out to a radius of @xmath37 au @xcite .",
    "it exhibits a transitional sed @xcite , and observations of the rovibrational co spectrum reveal gas with disparate rotational and vibrational temperatures ( 200 k and 5000 k respectively ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicative of uv fluorescence on the outer edges of an inner disk region cleared of gas and dust .",
    "an analysis of the chemistry and gas properties of the system similar to the one presented here for 49 ceti was conducted by @xcite . while the presence and extent of the inner hole are clearly indicated , the physical origin of this clearing is less obvious .",
    "the br@xmath38 profile is indicative of substantial accretion , and @xcite deem a photoevaporative clearing mechanism unlikely due to the large column density outside the cleared region and the lack of evidence for a photoevaporative wind in the fuv @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite place a much lower limit of @xmath39 m@xmath40/yr on the accretion rate , based on the assumed gas : dust ratio of 100 and the low optical depth of the inner disk , which would be much more consistent with a photoevaporation scenario .",
    "@xcite note that the rough coincidence of the inner rim of the disk with the gravitational radius suggests that photoevaporation in concert with viscous accretion is a likely cause for the inner disk clearing .",
    "whatever the origin of their morphology , the observed gas and dust properties indicate that the disks surrounding both 49 ceti and hd 141569 appear to be in a transitional state of evolution during which the dust properties are beginning to appear more like those of a debris disk , while the gas is in the process of being cleared from the disk from the center out .",
    "the sma co j=2 - 1 observations presented here provide the first spatially resolved observations of molecular gas in the 49 ceti system .",
    "the data reveal a surprisingly extended and complex molecular gas distribution in rotation about the central star , viewed approximately edge on and clear of molecular gas emission in the central region of the disk .",
    "modeling the disk structure and chemistry in this system indicates that the inner disk is entirely devoid of molecular gas due to irradiation by the central star , while a ring of molecular gas persists between 40 and 200 au , subject to photodissociation at the inner edge by stellar radiation .",
    "the disk model presented here reproduces well the observed properties of the system , including the resolved co j=2 - 1 emission , the co j=3 - 2 spectrum , and the spectral energy distribution . with dust properties similar to those of a debris disk and a substantial reservoir of gas maintained in the outer disk ,",
    "49 ceti appears to be a rare example of a system in a late stage of transition between a gas - rich protoplanetary disk and a tenuous , gas - free debris disk .",
