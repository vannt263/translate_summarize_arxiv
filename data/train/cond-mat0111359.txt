    "the complex system we are studying needs to be implemented taking care of all the necessary details . we will consider a cellular automaton ( ca ) defined on a square lattice ( due to the limitations of memory the maximum side length is about 800 - 1000 units ) with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the simulations start all from a single seed placed in the center of the grid .",
    "the behaviour of every cell depends on the eight nearest neighbours : this is the moore type neighbourhood as defined in @xcite .",
    "+ the typical yeast life cycle is very simple to mimic and we examine the simplest behaviour that a cell could keep : it eats nutrient ( a generic name that means above all sugar , with small percentage of other substances ) and it eliminates waste ( that in our context is alcohol ) .",
    "the specific chemical composition of these substances is however not important here .",
    "+ we define two overall initial variables : the concentration of nutrient @xmath0 and the concentration of waste @xmath1 ( usually set to zero , but one could wish to explore other regions in the @xmath2 phase space ) .",
    "these quantities are not properly concentrations but rather amount of solute because they are defined as the product of the squared size of the grid ( the volume ) and the percentage ( a number from 0 to 1 ) .",
    "+ the reason to introduce such variables is simple : in the real situation yeast cells can not tolerate an alcohol concentration higher than @xmath3 .",
    "the colony is `` killed '' by poisoning when this value is reached : this is some sort of criticality because the system grows , obeying to certain probability rules that we will explain below , consuming food and producing waste until the refusals are too much to let the colony live . for our purposes",
    "the initial concentration of food is very large acting as a reservoir , but we can imagine situations in which the colony is `` killed '' ( or properly inactivated ) by starvation .",
    "one may think to other strategies to implement food and waste like introducing a food cell that is absorbed when in contact with a yeast cell , thus producing one waste cell .",
    "this is however not necessary because the typical duplication time of a colony is of the order of 30 - 60 minutes , depending on various strains of yeast , on the temperature and other environmental features . in that amount of time , at room temperature and for small enough systems , the solution has the same concentration in every point because a normal yeast cell is an oval of about @xmath4 and hence , accordingly with what we have stated before , the maximum grid could have a size of about @xmath5 , some millimeters in the biggest case .",
    "+ the larger is the area exposed to the solution , the higher is the exchange rate both of nutrients and of waste .",
    "hence if all the nearest neighbouring cells are occupied there is no way to eat : in such condition the yeast survives but is in a suspended situation .",
    "if we allow the ca to move , as explained below , the yeast cell can restart to have a normal life in any moment in the future .",
    "this takes care of the effect of overcrowding in the evolution of the system .",
    "+ we can imagine that this movement is characterized by a simple random walk of one step in one of the eight surrounding squares ( like the king movement in the game of chess ) .",
    "a `` mobility '' parameter @xmath6 is related to the average brownian motion of the full points in the grid . for every generation",
    "a cell is chosen at random and moved randomly in one of the eight directions ( if it is not occupied by another member of the community ) .",
    "obviously a completely surrounded one can not move , but it could return to walk in any successive step of the colony evolution .",
    "this is repeated @xmath7 $ ] times where @xmath8 is number of individuals and @xmath6 is the mobility parameter , that becomes an integer when we take the floor function as indicated with square brackets . in so doing a given cell",
    "could be picked out more than one time , and there could be cells that are not moved .",
    "this is intended to portray a completely random environment and is in some way a new type of modellization for such a specific system .",
    "similar stochastic automata are discussed with very great care for example in ref.@xcite , @xcite .",
    "+ an important point here is the introduction in our ca of a probability rule for replication that depends upon all the relevant geometric and chemical details included in the present discussion . at a certain generation @xmath9 , that corresponds to a certain time @xmath10 , the probability for an empty cell @xmath11 of becoming occupied , because of the mitosis of a neighbouring occupied cell , is @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an area factor that is proportional to the number of empty neighbouring cells @xmath14",
    ", @xmath15 is a food factor proportional to the overall concentration of food , normalized to the initial value .",
    "it is one at the beginning and decreases during the evolution .",
    "@xmath16 is a waste factor that is zero at the first cycle and increases proportionally to the quantity of alcohol expelled .",
    "the functional dependence of these factors on the concentrations has been taken to be linear , but one can think to other ways of implementing @xmath15 and @xmath16 . from the definitions above we see that @xmath17 .",
    "+ we denote by @xmath18 the amount of food absorbed by a single cell in every duplication time , that is equal , for the sake of simplicity , to the amount of waste produced at the same time .",
    "hence we can write the concentrations of food and waste at the time @xmath10 as follows : @xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 is the population at the i - th cycle .",
    "+ the whole life cycle is iterated thus generating the complex dynamics .",
    "a typical run consists of :    1 .",
    "seeding of the first progenitor .",
    "2 .   iteration of many generations as long as saturation is reached .",
    "3 .   measure of saturation values for radius and width .    in particular for the point 2",
    ": every generation means a complete life cycle for the colony .",
    "the principal rules are the following :    * metabolism : every yeast cell eats an amount @xmath18 of food thus producing an equal quantity of waste .",
    "* mobility : if @xmath22 then every cell is moved accordingly to the stochastic rule exposed in the above discussion .",
    "* duplication : if the probability @xmath23 is greater than a random number , chosen in the range @xmath24 , a cellular subdivision occurs ( mitosis ) .",
    "* measurement : the number of individuals and concentrations as well as radius and width are recorded .",
    "many runs are typically taken into account , and extensive simulations are performed with different sets of parameters , as will be discussed below .",
    "our simple automata are suitable to breed a huge variety of situation , but the gross feature of the evolution in essentially the same : after the well - known initial exponentially growing phase the duplication becomes hindered by the cooperation of diverse mechanism , each leading to a small rate of birth of new individuals : overcrowding , starvation and poisoning act in the same direction .",
    "note that this concepts are not only effective in yeast growing , but a huge class of ecological and biological systems is based on the same foundations , first of all the human kind , even if the control mechanisms are much more intricately involved and hard to analyze .",
    "the last part of the evolution reaches a saturation value after which the growth stops completely because the alcohol concentration turns to the critical value .",
    "let us begin with the discussion of the case with no brownian motion @xmath26 , when cells are not allowed to move on the grid .",
    "the shape is very compact and the colony develop in a larger number of generation , until the poisoning is achieved .",
    "a typical evolution leads to the behaviour showed in figure 1 .",
    "[ colonia0 ]    we have measured the number of cellular automata at every cycle , as well as the concentration of food and waste . the radius of gyration of the cluster is defined as : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the distance from the center of mass @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the number of individuals in the surface region .",
    "the semi - width of the interface between the colony and the ambient solution is : @xmath31 these formulas are written in analogy with the correspondent quantities in a ballistic deposition simulation ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "+ in figure 2 we report the width divided by @xmath32 as a function of the time divided by @xmath33 .",
    "the collapse is so good that one can hardly distinguish the four different symbols used for four different values of the grid size .",
    "[ collapse ]    the exponents @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are defined measuring the scaling relations : @xmath37 @xmath38 with critical exponents +    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a general trend is the reduction of the @xmath34 exponent with the temperature , at the same time @xmath35 increases and @xmath36 decreases .",
    "even if our geometrical set up is very different from the already cited experiment of vicsek and even if we are dealing with diluted solutions rather than agar - agar plates , the observed reduction indicates that this is an essential feature to reproduce the reported experimental values .",
    "the only problem to solve is the delicated relation between the mobility of a typical yeast cell and our mobility parameter .",
    "we have made attempts in this direction and it seems that a @xmath39 generates a good accordance with the cited experimental value .",
    "+ we suggest that the value @xmath40 , that is somewhere in the middle between the eden model and ours , could be obtained if one accepts the role of thermal brownian motion .",
    "the data for @xmath34 systematically tend towards lower values with increasing mobility parameter .",
    "+ even in these cases the family - vicsek relation is verified , being the calculated @xmath36 very similar to the measured one : @xmath41 @xmath42 the family - vicsek scaling relations seem to be verified to a good accuracy and even in these cases a data collapse similar to the previous one has been verified . +",
    "the chemical correlations established by the diffusion of substances in the solution is studied by changing the initial parameters .",
    "let us play with a phase space in which the relevant axis are @xmath43 and @xmath44 , fixing the mobility parameter to zero for semplicity .",
    "two regions can be identified accordingly to whether the colony is able to live or it must die .",
    "the localization of the surface between the life - zone and the death - zone is interesting .",
    "+ the following figure illustrates the dependence of the number of individuals with the amount of food at disposal varied between @xmath24 for two different system size .",
    "as one can imagine @xmath8 growths if the initial amount of food is high , but the mathematical formula could not be simple to guess .",
    "we believe that it growths like a logarithm .",
    "the same has been done by keeping the amount of food fixed ( and equal to @xmath45 ) and changing the critical value for the waste from @xmath46 to @xmath47 , for two different grid sizes .",
    "the result are very similar , but the slope is less steep .",
    "however , as one could expect , the number of individuals is much more sensitive on this parameters because this is the mechanism that actively stops the growth .",
    "having this two sections in mind , one can easily reconstruct a surface in the three dimensional space @xmath48 , even if it s not simple to find the other section , namely the one in the @xmath49 plane , because the code does not allow to fix the number of cells that is an output . +",
    "another interesting graph we want to discuss displays the behaviour of the number of generation @xmath50 with the amount of food .",
    "surprisingly when there is a small quantity of nutrient in the solution , the number of generation is greater .",
    "this is due to the fact that a few individuals are allowed to live , but not to reproduce thus slightly consuming the food storage and producing only a few poison .",
    "+ for intermediate values of food amount there are oscillations in the number of generation , probably due to the effect of balance between the two regimes .",
    "+ a similar , but much less impressive plot could be done by changing the killing amount of waste and recording the number of generations .    in this case",
    "the curve is almost linear and very easy to discuss : if a yeast cell could bear a larger concentration of poison in the solution , the number of generations growths linearly .",
    "different yeast strains have different tolerance with respect to alcohol concentration and our model might be too simple to be of help when very different species are considered . we think that the behaviour that we have discussed depends , to a large extent , on the functional form of eq . ( 1.1 ) .",
    "we have depicted a typical scenario that holds for a large number of complex systems involving living organism .",
    "an accurate modelling has been achieved by means of a cellular automaton defined on the square lattice .",
    "the generated patterns as well as some important critical exponents have been achieved .",
    "the role of the brownian motion has been discussed and has been outlined the importance of a much deeper understanding of the behaviour of the exponents with respect to the temperature that seems to influence the dynamic in a cumbersome way .",
    "+ it is very probable that a proper understanding of the movements of cells in bacteria or fungi colonies could be the key feature in reproducing the experimentally observed scaling behaviour .",
    "+ we suggest to biologists or physicists interested in this field to undertake simple experiments to measure critical behaviour of colony growth in solutions of nutrient at different temperatures with the intent to better understand the role of the brownian motion in this context and to check our results .",
    "+ we remark the fact that this kind of evolution with instantaneous chemical correlations and thermal movement is much more akin to the real one : industrial or natural fermentation process and evolution of life very often occurs in a concentrated solution at room temperature rather than on an agar plate",
    ". a further step will be to implement a new geometrical arrangement , similar to the vicsek experiment one , with the goal to reproduce the scaling exponents , and to study the possibility of a multilayer colony .",
    "+ the interest for this kind of studies could be broader than what we have depicted : many other features arising from different chemical or biochemical mechanisms could be used to introduce more complexity and new patterns .",
