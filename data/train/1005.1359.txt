    "thin position for knots was first defined by gabai in his proof of property @xmath5 , @xcite .",
    "the idea of width has had important applications in 3-manifold topology .",
    "in particular , width played an integral role in three celebrated results : the solution to the knot complement problem @xcite , the recognition problem for @xmath6 @xcite , and the leveling of unknotting tunnels @xcite .",
    "however , surprisingly little is known about its intrinsic properties .",
    "most strikingly , the behavior of knot width under connected sums has remained one of the most interesting and difficult problems to elucidate . in an attempt to shed light on this question ,",
    "width has been compared to bridge number  the least number of maxima over all projections of the knot . just like bridge number ,",
    "width depends on the number of critical points of a projection , but it also takes into account their relative heights .",
    "the behavior of bridge number under connected sum was first established by schubert , @xcite .",
    "later , schultens gave a considerably more elegant proof of the result , @xcite .",
    "stacking the two knots vertically and connecting a minimum of the top one to a maximum of the bottom one shows that @xmath7 schubert s result affirms that inequality [ eq : bridgeineq ] is in fact an equality .",
    "this construction also gives an easy inequality for the width of a connected sum , namely @xmath8 based on schubert s result , it was conjectured that inequality [ eq : widthadditiveineq ] is also an equality .",
    "however , proving this remained an open problem .",
    "partial results and special cases have been solved .",
    "most notably , scharlemann and schultens showed in @xcite that @xmath9 and rieck and sedgwick showed in @xcite that the equality @xmath10 holds for meridionally small knots .",
    "the main result in this paper is that inequality [ eq : widthadditiveineq ] is strict for some knots and that inequality [ eq : schschineq ] is best possible if no restrictions are placed on the knots .",
    "[ thm : counterwidth ] there exists an infinite family of knots @xmath0 and @xmath1 so that @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , the construction also yields examples of another interesting phenomenon .",
    "[ thm : counterbridge ] there exists an infinite family of knots @xmath0 so that the minimal bridge position for @xmath0 has fewer critical points than the thin position of @xmath0 .",
    "our construction is based on ideas proposed by scharlemann and thompson in @xcite . in their paper , the authors give a large family of pairs of knots @xmath11 and @xmath12 for which it appears that @xmath13 .",
    "this equality relies on the assumption that the projections of @xmath11 and @xmath12 considered by scharlemann and thompson have minimal width amongst all possible projections of the knots , i.e. , that @xmath11 and @xmath12 are in thin position .",
    "one of the knots in each pair is quite simple and its width is easily established .",
    "however , the authors could not verify the width of the second knot in any of their pairs . in @xcite",
    ", the current authors establish that in fact for most of these pairs the second knot is not in thin position .",
    "therefore , most of these pairs do not provide the desired counterexample to the conjectured equality @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    ", we construct a family of pairs of knots @xmath11 and @xmath12 that satisfy the properties required for the pairs presented in @xcite and we establish that both @xmath11 and @xmath12 are in thin position . for such a pair , it follows that @xmath13 .",
    "figure [ fig : counter ] depicts such a pair where one knot is the trefoil .",
    "the figure demonstrates a projection of @xmath14 that has the same width as the given projection of @xmath15 . we will show that this projection of @xmath15 is of minimal width .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after some preliminary definitions in section [ vertical cut - disks ] , we show that if a knot is in thin position and @xmath16 is a thin level sphere , then cut - disks for @xmath16 that do not intersect any other thin spheres can be isotoped to be vertical .",
    "this allows us to use the results about vertical cut - disks developed in @xcite . in section [ sec : bridgesurfaces ] , we review results found in @xcite about the behavior of a second bridge surface for a tangle that has a high distance bridge sphere . in section [ sec :",
    "knotting ] , we use a theorem of schubert to construct tangles with high distance properties so that the numerator closures of certain subtangles yield non - trivial knots . in section",
    "[ sec : esssurface ] , we construct a three strand tangle for which we can classify all essential meridional surfaces of euler characteristic greater than @xmath17 . in section [ sec : construction ] , we construct the candidate knots @xmath11 .",
    "each of these knots has the general schematic introduced in @xcite , see figure [ fig : counter ] . in section [ sec : properties ] , we establish some of the properties of the knots .",
    "the proofs of these properties depend on the results in the previous sections . in section [ sec : meress ] , we classify all essential meridional spheres in the complement of @xmath11 that have fewer than 14 punctures . in section [ sec : bridgenumber ] , we determine that bridge position and thin position for @xmath11 do not coincide . in section [ sec : lemmas ] , we introduce some additional lemmas .",
    "finally , in section [ sec:134 ] , we show that the projection given in figure [ fig : counter ] of each of the knots @xmath11 is thin by checking the widths of a relatively small number of possible thin positions .",
