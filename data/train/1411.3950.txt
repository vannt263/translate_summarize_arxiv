    "given an asymmetric body on a circular orbit , denoting @xmath0 its rotation angle in the plane with respect to the inertial frame , the only possible spin - orbit resonance is the synchronous one @xmath1 , @xmath2 being the mean motion of the orbit . on an keplerian eccentric orbit , wisdom _",
    "et al . _ ( 1984 ) showed that there is a whole family of spin - orbit eccentric resonances , the main ones being @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an integer . in 2013 ,",
    "correia and robutel showed that in the circular case , the presence of a coorbital companion induced a splitting of the synchronous resonance , forming a family of co - orbital spin - orbit resonances of the form @xmath5 , @xmath6 being the libration frequency in the coorbital resonance .",
    "inside this resonance , the difference of the mean anomaly of the two coorbitals , denoted by @xmath7 , librates around a value close to @xmath8 ( around the l4 or l5 lagrangian equilibrium - tadpole configuration ) , around @xmath9 ( encompassing l3 , l4 and l5 - horseshoe configuration ) or @xmath10 ( quasi - satellite ) configuration .",
    "we generalize the results of correia and robutel ( 2013 ) from the case of circular co - orbital orbits to eccentric ones .",
    "the rotation angle @xmath0 satisfies the differential equation : @xmath11    where @xmath12 are the internal momenta of the body , @xmath13 the polar coordinates of the center of the studied body and @xmath14 its instantaneous semi - major axis .",
    "let us consider that the orbit is quasi - periodic . as a consequence ,",
    "the elliptic elements of the body can be expended in fourier series whose frequencies are the fundamental frequencies of the planetary system . in other words",
    "the time - dependent quantity @xmath15 that appears in equation ( [ eq : rot_gene ] ) reads :    @xmath16    where @xmath17 are linear combinations with integer coefficients of the fundamental frequencies of the orbital motion ( here @xmath2 and @xmath6 ) and @xmath18 their phases .",
    "thus ( [ eq : rot_gene ] ) becomes :    @xmath19    for a keplerian circular orbit , the only spin orbit resonance possible is the synchronous one , since @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 for @xmath23 . in the general keplerian case",
    "we have the spin - orbit eccentric resonances , @xmath24 and the @xmath25 are the hansen coefficients @xmath26 ( see wisdom _",
    "et al . _ ) .",
    "for the circular coorbital case , correia and robutel ( 2013 ) showed that a whole family results from the splitting of the synchronous resonance of the form @xmath27 .",
    "for small amplitudes of libration around l4 or l5 ( tadpole ) , the width of the resonant island decreases as @xmath28 increases .",
    "+ in the eccentric coorbital case , each eccentric spin - orbit resonance of the keplerian case splits in resonant multiplets which are centred in @xmath29 .",
    "for relatively low amplitude of libration of @xmath7 , the width of the resonant island decreases as @xmath28 increases , see figure [ fig ] ( left ) . but for higher amplitude , especially for horseshoe orbit , the main resonant island may not be located at @xmath30 . in figure",
    "[ fig ] ( right ) , the main islands are located at @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "these islands overlap , giving rise to chaotic motion for the spin , while the island located at @xmath33 is much thinner .     near the @xmath34 spin - orbit eccentric resonance .",

    "the coorbital spin - orbit resonances populate the phase space between the eccentric resonances . generalised chaotic rotation",
    "can be achieved when harmonics of co - orbital spin - orbit resonances overlap each other , which is a different mechanism than the one described by wisdom _",
