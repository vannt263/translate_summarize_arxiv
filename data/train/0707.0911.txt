    "gas temperature is one of the basic parameters that control star formation activity . in the same volume",
    ", the interstellar medium is believed to be isothermal and the gas and dust temperatures should be the same .",
    "however , several surveys of the interstellar medium in the galactic center region reveal different temperatures of gas and dust .",
    "the dust temperature is measured in the submillimeter / infrared continuum .",
    "it is found to be as cold as 20 k in the 450 @xmath7 m and 850 @xmath7 m continuum by the submillimetre common - user bolometer array ( @xcite ) or 1522 k in the 45175 @xmath7 m continuum by the infrared space observatory ( @xcite ) .    however , the molecular gas is warmer than the dust . in the millimeter line observations made using the iram 30-m telescope ,",
    "the gas temperature is found to be as high as 6070 k by multi - line analysis ( @xcite ) .",
    "a more direct estimation of the gas temperature is derived from nh@xmath0 line observations .",
    "@xcite observed the nh@xmath0 @xmath1 = ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) , and ( 3,3 ) lines of the galactic center region at @xmath8 using the nrao 11-m telescope .",
    "they concluded that the kinetic temperature is uniformly between 30 and 60 k. @xcite observed the nh@xmath0 @xmath1 = ( 1,1 ) , ( 2,2 ) and ( 4,4 ) , ( 5,5 ) lines of selected clouds using the nrao 43-m telescope and a few small maps using the bonn 100-m telescope .",
    "they reported two temperature components of gas ; the first , derived from the intensity ratio of ( 2,2 ) to ( 1,1 ) , was as low as 25 k , while the second , derived from the intensity ratio of ( 5,5 ) to ( 4,4 ) , was as high as 200 k.    these nh@xmath0 surveys suggest that the gas in the galactic center would be a mixture of hot and cold gases .",
    "however , the previous surveys cover only limited regions , such as on a single strip along the galactic plane or only selected clouds . therefore",
    ", a large - scale survey is required to comprehensively study the conditions of the entire molecular gas in the central molecular zone ( cmz ) .",
    "we have observed the cmz in the nh@xmath0 lines to investigate the dense gas .",
    "we present the large - scale data of the galactic center in the nh@xmath0 @xmath1 = ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines for the first time . in section 2",
    ", we describe the observations .",
    "the data are presented in section 3 . in section 4 , we discuss the physical conditions of the molecular gas in the cmz through comparisons with previous observations . in this paper , we assume that the distance to the galactic center is 8.5 kpc .",
    "for the direction and position in the sky , we use galactic east as the positive galactic longitude , and galactic north as the positive galactic latitude .",
    "we conducted a large - scale survey using the kagoshima 6-m telescope of the national astronomical observatory of japan ( naoj ) from september 2000 to april 2002 .",
    "we made simultaneous observations in two inversion transitions of the nh@xmath0 @xmath1 = ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines at 23.694495 and 23.722633 ghz , respectively . at a wavelength of 1.3 cm ,",
    "the telescope beamwidth is and the main beam efficiency ( @xmath9 ) is 0.59 .",
    "we used a @xmath10-band hemt amplifier whose system noise temperature is 200300 k and a 2048-channel teo@xmath11 crystal acoustic - optical spectrometer with a bandwidth of 250 mhz and frequency resolution of 250 khz . at the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) frequencies , these correspond to 3200 km s@xmath12 velocity coverage and 3.2 km s@xmath12 velocity resolution .",
    "we obtained approximately 250 nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) spectra at @xmath2 and @xmath3 with a spacing of .",
    "the surveyed area corresponds to 390@xmath1390 pc based on the distance to the galactic center , 8.5 kpc .",
    "all data were obtained by position switching between the target positions and reference positions .",
    "the reference positions were obtained at the galactic latitude @xmath14 , where neither nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) nor ( 2,2 ) emission was detected .",
    "we integrated at least 30 min at each point .",
    "the relative pointing error is better than , which was verified by the observations of several h@xmath11o ( frequency 22.235080 ghz ) maser sources .",
    "data reduction was performed using the ultrastar package developed by the radio astronomy group at the university of tokyo ( @xcite , in preparation ) . to improve the signal to noise ratio ,",
    "the obtained spectra are smoothed to a velocity resolution of 5 or 10 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the rms noise level after 5 km s@xmath12 smoothing is typically 0.080 k in the unit of the main beam brightness temperature defined by @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the antenna temperature calibrated by the chopper wheel method ( @xcite ) . in this paper ,",
    "the intensities are presented in the main beam temperature .      in order to confirm the `` wing feature '' ( see section 3.6 ) , we carried out a single point observation at @xmath17 .",
    "this observation was made using the beam of the kashima 34-m telescope of the national institute of information and communications technology ( nict ) on april 18 , 2006 .",
    "the single point spectra in the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines were obtained by the same method using the kagoshima 6-m telescope survey .",
    "figure [ fig : profile ] shows the line profiles of nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) at @xmath18 near the giant molecular cloud sgr b shown with a velocity resolution of 5 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the line shapes of the two nh@xmath0 transitions are very similar over a 150 km s@xmath12 range .",
    "in quiescent clouds , the nh@xmath0 line profile comprises five quadruple hyperfine components consisting of a main line and two symmetric pairs of satellite lines .",
    "the intensity ratio of the main line and the satellite lines provides the optical depth of each rotational level , and a unique rotational temperature is derived from the ratio of the optical depth at different rotational levels .    in the galactic center region , molecular emission is extended in the sky and shows violent motion even in the comparatively small area covered by a single telescope beam .",
    "in fact , none of our data profiles show satellite lines above the noise level .",
    "therefore , it is difficult to separate the five quadruple hyperfine components from the observed spectra with a large beam .",

    "the nh@xmath0 emission is concentrated at @xmath23 and its distribution is asymmetrical with respect to sgr a * at @xmath24 .",
    "the intensity of the nh@xmath0 line located at the galactic eastern side of sgr a * is 81% in the entire observed area , although it is 73% in the cs line derived from a map by @xcite .",
    "the nh@xmath0 emissions are also extended along galactic latitude .",
    "the total intensity at the observed positions on @xmath25 , effectively covering a strip of one beamwidth , is only 27% in the entire observed area .",
    "the overall distribution along galactic latitude appears to be symmetric about @xmath26 , where sgr a * is located .",
    "the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) along galactic latitude is @xmath27  , which is almost the same as co ; however , it is more confined at the region and at @xmath28 .",
    "the strongest nh@xmath0 emission in our observations originates from the sgr b cloud , which has a large number of h regions .",

    "all of them are identified to be the known molecular clouds seen in other molecular lines .",
    "the two clouds that appear at @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the `` sgr a 20 km s@xmath12 cloud '' and `` sgr a 40 km s@xmath12 cloud '' , respectively , which were identified by @xcite .",

    "the wing at @xmath40 extends from @xmath41 km s@xmath12 to @xmath42 km s@xmath12 .",
    "it is blueshifted from the main spectral feature by 80 km s@xmath12 .",
    "this blueshifted wing is also seen in previous observations of both the nh@xmath0 ( @xcite ) and cs ( @xcite ) emission , although no one mentioned about this feature .",
    "the wing is associated with the double peak profiles ( @xmath43 and 80 km s@xmath12 ) at @xmath44 .",
    "although the 80 km s@xmath12 component is the main ridge through the entire galactic center region linked with @xmath45 , the 20 km s@xmath12 component is seen only at these four positions .",
    "the fwhm of the 20 km s@xmath12 component is larger than 50 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the blueshifted wing of the 20 km s@xmath12 component is conspicuous in the @xmath5-@xmath6 diagram at @xmath46 , whereas that in the @xmath5-@xmath6 diagram at @xmath38 is blended with the intense emission from sgr b cloud .",
    "however , the 20 km s@xmath12 component of @xmath47 is stronger than that of @xmath48 .",
    "we made higher resolution observations at @xmath49 using the kashima 34-m telescope .",
    "figure [ fig : profile3 ] shows the spectra obtained in the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines . from these observations , the blueshifted wing and the 20 km s@xmath12 component are confirmed in both the ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines .",
    "the intensity ratio of the ( 2,2 ) line to ( 1,1 ) line , @xmath50 , is controlled by the kinetic temperature and optical depth of nh@xmath0 gas .",
    "previous estimations of the optical depth of nh@xmath0 are @xmath51 for the sgr a 20 km s@xmath12 cloud ( @xcite ) , @xmath52 in the stronger nh@xmath0 emitting sources , and @xmath53 in the weaker sources ( @xcite ) . because the flux of our observations originates from weaker and more extended sources than the previous observations , the optical depth may be significantly smaller than these results",
    ".    the cs line can also trace dense gas . in the galactic center region ,",
    "the cs line emission has moderate optical depth , @xmath54 23 .",
    "the total molecular mass in the cmz is @xmath55 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite estimate that the large scale @xmath56co ( @xmath57 ) emission in the cmz is of maderate ( @xmath58 ) or low optical depth ( @xmath59 ) and the total molecular mass in the cmz is @xmath60 .",
    "the total fluxes in the nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) lines are @xmath61 and @xmath22 jy km s@xmath12 , respectively . in the case where the nh@xmath0 emission is optically thin ,",
    "the total mass of the molecular gas in the whole region is @xmath62 based on @xmath63 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the total masses derived from nh@xmath0 , cs , and co are consistent .",
    "this suggests that the nh@xmath0 line should have moderate optical depth or low optical depth .",
    "therefore , we estimate the rotational temperature @xmath64 from @xmath50 in the optically thin ( @xmath65 ) and optically thick ( @xmath66 ) cases using the method of @xcite . the conversion from @xmath64 to @xmath67",
    "is performed according to @xcite .",
    "it shows that @xmath67 is always higher than @xmath64 .",
    "when @xmath64 is less than 20 k , it is very close to @xmath67 , and when @xmath64 is 40 k , @xmath67 is 80 k , which is almost two times higher than @xmath64 ( see table [ tab:2 ] ) .",
    "before we calculate the temperature , we examine the @xmath50 statistics .",
    "figure [ fig : histogram ] shows a histogram of @xmath50 for pixels in the entire observed area at which an nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) line was detected over a 1.5 @xmath30 level after smoothing to 10 km s@xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath50 is within a range from 0.5 to 1.8 in our data .",
    "previous observations indicate the discrepancies in the gas and dust temperatures in the galactic center .",
    "the gas temperature is always higher than the dust temperature .",
    "the hot gas temperature is approximately 100 k and the cold dust temperature is approximately 20 k. for the obtained value of @xmath50 , we divide the ratios into three regimes ( @xmath68 0.50.6 , @xmath68 0.70.8 , and @xmath69 0.9 ) which correspond to gas temperatures ranging from that of cold dust ( 20 k ) to hot gas ( exceeding 100 k ) .",
    "@xmath68 0.50.6 corresponds to @xmath70 2030 k and @xmath71 2040 k. the nh@xmath0 flux with @xmath68 0.50.6 is approximately 25% of the total nh@xmath0 flux .",
    "the low value of @xmath64 and @xmath67 is close to the dust temperatures given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this low @xmath50 gas is as cool as the cold dust .    the gas with @xmath68 0.70.8 , which corresponds to @xmath70 3040 k and @xmath71 4080 k , is warmer than the cold dust .",
    "the nh@xmath0 flux of this warm gas is approximately 50% of the total nh@xmath0 flux .",
    "@xmath50 of this dominant gas component is consistent with the ratios found by @xcite .",
    "the histogram also shows a small number of high ratio ( @xmath72 ) pixels .",
    "the nh@xmath0 flux with this high @xmath50 is approximately 25% of the total nh@xmath0 flux .",
    "these high @xmath50 pixels appear at the edge of the nh@xmath0 emitting region on the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane ( see figure [ fig : ratio ] ) .",
    "in fact , when we compare the obtained ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) profiles , @xmath50 sometimes appears to increase in both the line edges .",
    "figure [ fig : sample ] shows the spectra of nh@xmath0 ( 1,1 ) and ( 2,2 ) at @xmath73 and @xmath74 with a velocity resolution of 5 km s@xmath12 .",
    "these spectra show the higher ( 2,2)/(1,1 ) ratio at the edges of the profiles , because the line width of ( 2,2 ) has extended more than that of ( 1,1 ) .    before considering this ratio enhancement due to gas property",
    ", we should check effects of the satellite lines .",
    "the satellite lines of ( 2,2 ) that have a wider frequency spacing than those of ( 1,1 ) .",
    "the separations of satellite lines in the ( 2,2 ) transition are @xmath75 and @xmath76 km s@xmath12 .",
    "those in the ( 1,1 ) transition are @xmath77 and @xmath78 km s@xmath12 .",
    "this means that the broading due to the satellites in the ( 2,2 ) transition might be more sufficient than that in the ( 1,1 ) transition . to evaluate this effect",
    ", we examine it with the cases of some optical depths . a typical nh@xmath0",
    "line exhibits a gaussian shape profile with a 60 km s@xmath12 width and the typical ratio of the nh@xmath0 ( 2,2 ) line to the ( 1,1 ) line is 0.75 . in the case of moderate and low optical depth ( @xmath59 ) , the satellite lines of ( 2,2 ) are much weaker than the main line and could not affect the observed line width of ( 2,2 ) . in the case of the high optical depth ( @xmath79 ) , the satellite lines affect the observed line width . the wider separation in the ( 2,2 ) line results in greater broadening than that in the case of the ( 1,1 ) line , which gives ratio enhancement at the line edge .",
    "thus , in this case , the higher ratio at the line edges were not real .",
    "however , the nh@xmath0 emission in the cmz is not high optically thick ( @xmath80 ) .",
    "therefore , the higher ratio at the line edges means that the gas near the velocity edge is hotter than bulk of the cloud .    the cold gas , which is as cool as the cold dust , constitutes approximately 25% of the dense molecular gas based on the nh@xmath0 emission .",
    "our complete survey of the cmz shows that the dense molecular gas in the cmz is dominated by gas that is warmer than the majority of dust present there .",
    "although we can not estimate the molecular gas temperature in regions where no nh@xmath0 emission is detected , we can make rough evaluations using other spectral lines . using the intensity ratios of @xmath56co ( @xmath57 ) over @xmath56co ( @xmath81 ) , @xmath82 , and of @xmath83co ( @xmath57 ) over @xmath56co ( @xmath57 ) , @xcite derived the gas pressure of molecular clouds in the galactic center region .",
    "our nh@xmath0 observations are made with the same beamsize and the same sampling grid as that in the observations in @xmath56co ( @xmath81 ) using the cfa 1.2-m telescope ( @xcite ) and @xmath56co ( @xmath57 ) using the tokyo - onsala - eso - caln 60-cm telescope ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we can make direct comparisons with the @xmath82 distribution .",

    "this absorption effect is not seen in nh@xmath0 line .",
    "when comparing the distributions of the nh@xmath0 emission and @xmath82 on the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane at @xmath38 and , the nh@xmath0 emitting region is surrounded by the high @xmath82 region . in the sgr b molecular cloud complex with its intense nh@xmath0 emission ,",
    "@xmath82 is not very high .    for @xmath46 , @xcite provide the gas pressure distribution using the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximation ( @xcite ) . for @xmath85 @xmath86 , which is the nh@xmath0 critical density ( @xcite ; @xcite )",
    ", we can also obtain the distribution of kinetic temperature from their lvg approximation ( see figure [ fig : co_ratio ] ( c ) ) .",
    "this provides an upper limit for the temperature in the region emitting nh@xmath0 , and a lower limit for the region without nh@xmath0 emission .    for @xmath38",
    ", we can not obtain the @xmath67 limit because @xcite derive @xmath87(h@xmath88 only for @xmath46 .",
    "however , using the @xmath46 data , we find a correlation between @xmath87(h@xmath11 ) @xmath67 and @xmath82 , as shown in figure [ fig : relation ] .",
    "the correlation is summarized as follows : @xmath87(h@xmath11 ) @xmath67 increases with @xmath82 and @xmath87(h@xmath11 ) @xmath89 k @xmath86 when @xmath82 = 1.0 .",
    "this implies that the high @xmath82 value indicates a high pressure region that can in principle be dense or hot .",
    "although nh@xmath0 emission can trace dense gas , it does not extend into the high pressure region , at least at high intensities .",
    "therefore , the high pressure region is less dense and hotter . in the galactic center",
    ", the molecular cloud complex has `` cores '' of dense and warm clouds which are traced in the nh@xmath0 emission , and an `` envelope '' of less dense and hotter gas clouds . for the cores ,",
    "the pressure is found to be @xmath90",

    ", the pressure is found to be @xmath93 k @xmath86 from the lvg approximation .",
    "the density @xmath94 ) should be less than @xmath95 @xmath86 in the envelope because of the absence of nh@xmath0 emission there .",
    "this reveals that the kinetic temperature of the envelope is at least 100 k.      in the previous section , we showed that the large scale structure of the molecular cloud complex in the cmz exhibits a dense core surrounded by a hot envelope . what is the heating source of the envelope",
    "there are four possibilities .",
    "the first is radiation from massive stars . for @xmath96 ,",
    "the h regions traced by the h109@xmath97 line ( @xcite ) appear in the high pressure region ( see figure [ fig : ohir ] ( a ) ) .",
    "this suggests that the high pressure region is heated by intense radiation from the massive ob stars .",
    "this model appears to be invalid for @xmath98 , because the h regions appear in the core of the sgr b cloud that exhibits intense nh@xmath0 emission .",
    "therefore , a hot gas heated by intense radiation should be present there",
    ". however , we believe this feature is due to a dilution effect . the hot gas must be compact and surrounded by a large amount of cold gas . in this case",
    ", the derived gas temperature with our beam should be low .",
    "in fact , hot and compact gas regions in sgr b are detected by high resolution observations .",
    "@xcite obtained two emission cores of at @xmath99 km s@xmath12 with @xmath100 150300 k in sgr b2 .",
    "they also found the 85 km s@xmath12 component with @xmath101 k in sgr b2(n ) .",
    "actually , the 85 km s@xmath12 component , which is as large as , is detected in the high pressure region .",
    "there is further evidence of star formation during a short period in the high pressure region . in the high pressure region ,",
    "134 oh / ir stars observed using vla ( @xcite ) are located ( see figure [ fig : ohir ] ( b ) ) .",
    "this suggests that star formation was active during a short period in the high pressure region .",
    "these stars should heat the gas by radiation during this period .",
    "although intense radiation from the ob stars heats the molecular gas , late oh / ir stars are also sufficient to heat the dust and gas . however , the dust is known to be cool .",
    "photons with energy below 13.6 ev , which can not ionize the hydrogen , can heat warm gas , thereby transforming it to hot gas .",
    "using the blackbody spectra and the 13.6 ev cutoff , we can estimate the equivalent number of oh / ir stars required for an ob star to heat up the molecular gas .",
    "the typical temperatures of an oh / ir star and an ob star are 3000 k and 30000 k , respectively .",
    "the typical absolute magnitude of an ob star is @xmath102 .",
    "for an oh / ir star , the typical absolute magnitude is @xmath103 and @xmath102 in the case of a supergiant . using these values , we find that approximately 10 oh / ir stars or 1 oh / ir supergiant is equivalent to an ob star .",
    "this implies that oh / ir and ob stars are comparable heating sources .",
    "the distribution of oh / ir stars on the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane suggests that they heat the molecular gas in the high pressure region",
    ".    however , stellar radiation may not be a major heating mechanism for the cmz gas .",
    "the stellar radiation heats the molecular gas through dust heating . in that case",
    ", the dust temperature should be higher than the gas temperature .",
    "however , our observations indicate that the major portion of the molecular gas is warmer than the dust .",
    "heating by extremely hot plasma gas emitting x - ray is the second possibility .",
    "x - ray emission and radio continuum are intense for @xmath96 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the high pressure region , which is conspicuous for @xmath96 .",
    "the cooling luminosity of clouds in the cmz exceeds the x - ray luminosity by a factor of 40400 ( @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , it seems that the gas can not be heated by x - ray emission itself .",
    "however , the distribution of the hot plasma gas emitting x - ray is well coincident with the high pressure region .",
    "the total mass of the hot molecular gas in the high pressure region is @xmath104 from the co line intensity with the conversion factor @xmath105 @xmath106 ( k km s@xmath107 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the total thermal energy required to heat the warm gas ( 30 k ) to the hot gas ( 100 k ) is @xmath108 erg .",
    "conversely , in x - rays , the total thermal energy radiated from the hot plasma gas with a temperature of @xmath109 k is ( 48 ) @xmath110 erg ( @xcite ) .",
    "this value is @xmath111 times larger than the energy required to heat the warm gas to hot gas .",
    "therefore , the hot plasma gas emitting x - ray can heat the hot gas in the high pressure region with any in sufficient processes .",
    "the third is the shock heating through cloud - cloud collisions .",
    "this mechanism is suggested by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in the case of the cloud - cloud collisions , the gas temperature increases with the density and the line width ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , our result shows the high pressure region is less dense than the nh@xmath0 emitting region .",
    "@xcite reported that there is no good correlation between the temperature and the line width .",
    "these results suggest that the cloud - cloud collisions heating is not strongly supported .",
    "however , the energy of the turbulent motions in the clouds within 300 pc of the center is larger than the thermal energy required to heat to the hot gas , @xmath112 erg .",
    "the energy of the turbulent motions is @xmath113 erg ( @xcite ) .",

    "there are two possibilities .",
    "the morphology in the @xmath5-@xmath6 diagram and profiles suggest that the wing feature may be ejected from the sgr b cloud .",
    "it should have been ejected by star formation activity and/or supernova ( sn ) explosions .",
    "the higher gas temperature supports this idea .",
    "however , the kinetic energy of the component requires @xmath138 sn explosions .",
    "therefore , we do not favor the explosion approach to explain the origin . in the case of an explosive origin ,",
    "a tracer of lower density gas should exhibit a wider wing there .",
    "however , we can not confirm this feature , because the wing is overlapped by foreground gas in the spiral arms .",
    "the other possibility is gas infall from the off - plane .",
    "there are several models that suggest the exchange of gas between the disk and halo .",
    "some of them show that infalling gas is accumulated by the galactic magnetic field ( @xcite ) .",
    "the wing feature may be a compact and in - plane version of the molecular spur found in ngc 891 ( @xcite ) .    in the nro cs survey ,",
    "several high velocity wing features like the wing feature at other positions were observed ( @xcite ) .",
    "none of them , except the wing feature , exhibit any wings in our survey .",
    "however , most of them may exhibit a similar wing feature in high resolution observations of nh@xmath0 .",

    "the kinetic energy is estimated to be @xmath137 erg , which requires @xmath138 sn explosions .",
    "the other possibility of its origin is infall from off - plane .",
    "the kinetic temperatures derived from the ( 2,2 ) to ( 1,1 ) intensity ratios are 2080 k or exceed 80 k. the gases corresponding to temperature of 2080 k and @xmath4 80 k contain 75% and 25% of the total nh@xmath0 flux , respectively .",
    "our complete survey of the cmz showed that the dense molecular gas in the cmz is dominated by gas that is warmer than the majority of dust present in that region .",
    "a comparison with the co survey by @xcite showed the molecular cloud complex in the galactic center has a core of dense and warm clouds , and an envelope of less dense and hotter gas clouds .",
    "the heating mechanisms of the hot envelope are still in mystery , we propose heating by the thermal energy of the hot plasma gas observed in x - ray emission , besides by ambipolar diffusion .",
    "h regions are distributed over the galactic east side to a greater extent than oh / ir stars .",
