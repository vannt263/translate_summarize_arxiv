    "electrons in ferromagnetic conductors are differentiated with respect to their spin due to the exchange interaction which leads to a splitting of the corresponding energy bands and to a non - vanishing polarization of the conduction electrons .",
    "this spin polarization gives rise to a number of `` spintronic '' effects in magnetic nanostructures , such as giant magnetoresistance ( gmr ) @xcite and spin - transfer - torque @xcite .",
    "a conventional gmr spin - valve has low resistance in the parallel configuration of the two ferromagnetic layers and high resistance in the antiparallel configuration .",
    "the gmr is said to be inverse when the low resistance state corresponds to the antiparallel orientation of the ferromagnets @xcite .",
    "inverse gmr is observed in , for example , spin - valves incorporating minority carrier ferromagnetic layers @xcite .",
    "another possible implementation of the inverse gmr spin - valve , demonstrated in this paper , relies on an antiparallel exchange - pinning of two ferromagnetic layers of different coercivity to two antiferromagnetic layers .",
    "we have previously analyzed a novel spin - thermo - electronic ( ste ) oscillator @xcite based on a gmr exchange - spring multilayer @xcite having a n - shaped current - voltage characteristic ( ivc ) , connected in series to an inductor ( l ) which performs the function of current limiting in the circuit and thereby determines its resonance frequency .",
    "a tunable inductor , such as the one having a magnetic core @xcite , can be used to achieve a tunable resonator . however , in applications where the device footprint is tightly budgeted , it may be advantageous to employ a mirror - circuit configuration .",
    "namely , an inverse gmr spin - valve with an s - shaped ivc connected to a capacitor ( c ) in parallel .",
    "this paper provides a detailed analysis of this new structure as well as a comparison of the two ste oscillator designs .",
    "we show that the ste - c design proposed herein offers an attractive , compact alternative to the ste - l oscillator discussed previously @xcite .",
    "we consider a system of three ferromagnetic layers in which two strongly ferromagnetic layers 0 and 2 are exchange coupled through a weakly ferromagnetic spacer ( layer 1 ) while layer 3 is nonmagnetic as illustrated in fig.[noflip ] .",
    "we assume that the curie temperature @xmath0 of layer 1 is lower than the curie temperatures @xmath1 of layers 0 , 2 ; we also assume the magnetization direction of layer 0 to be fixed ; layer 2 is subject to a magnetic field @xmath2 directed opposite to the magnetization of layer 0 , which can be an external field , the fringing field from layer 0 , or a combination of the two .",
    "we require this magneto - static field to be weak enough so that at low temperatures @xmath3 the magnetization of layer 2 is kept parallel to the magnetization of layer 0 due to the exchange interaction between them via layer 1 . in the absence of the external field and",
    "if the temperature is above the curie point of the spacer , @xmath4 , this tri - layer is similar to the spin - flop ` free layer ' widely used in memory device applications@xcite .",
    "as it was shown in paper @xcite parallel orientations of the magnetization in layers 0 , 1 and 2 becomes unstable if the temperature exceeds some critical temperature @xmath5 .",
    "the magnetization direction in layer 2 tilts with an increase of the stack temperature @xmath3 in the temperature range @xmath6 .",
    "the dependence of the equilibrium tilt angle @xmath7 between the magnetization directions of layers 0 and 2 on @xmath3 and the magnetic filed @xmath2 is determined by the equation @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the widths and the magnetic moments of layers 1 and 2 , respectively ; @xmath12 is the exchange constant , @xmath13 is the exchange energy in layer 1 and @xmath14 is the lattice spacing .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is the ratio between the magnetic energy and the energy of the stack volume for the inhomogeneous distribution of the magnetization . at low temperatures the exchange energy prevails , the parameter @xmath16 and eq .",
    "( [ theta2 ] ) has only one root , @xmath17 , thus a parallel orientation of magnetic moments in layers 0 , 1 and 2 of the stack is thermodynamically stable .",
    "however , at temperature @xmath5 , for which @xmath18 two new solutions @xmath19 appear .",
    "the parallel magnetization corresponding to @xmath17 is now unstable , and the direction of the magnetization in region 2 tilts with an increase of temperature inside the interval @xmath20 .",
    "according to eq.([d ] ) the critical temperature @xmath21 of this orientational phase transition @xcite is equal to @xmath22    if the stack is joule heated by current @xmath23 its temperature @xmath24 is determined by the heat - balance condition @xmath25 and eq .",

    "the ivc is n - shaped so nonlinear current and magnetization - direction oscillations may spontaneously arise if the stack is incorporated in a voltage biased electrical circuit in series with an inductor @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the situation in which the stack has an inverse gmr @xcite , i.e. @xmath37 . as one can see from eq.([diffg ] ) , if @xmath37 , the numerator of the differential conductance is always positive while the denominator can be negative and hence the ivc of the stack is s - shaped as illustrated in fig .",

    "in this case the thermo - electonic control of the relative orientation of layers 0 and 2 may be of two types depending on the ratio between the resistance of the stack @xmath29 and the resistance of the rest of the circuit @xmath42 .    as one can see from fig.[cvc ] , if the bias current @xmath43 through the stack is controllably applied ( that is @xmath44 ) , the voltage drop across the stack is uniquely determined from the ivc @xmath45 and hence the relative orientation of the magnetization of layers 0 and 2 ( that is the tilt angle @xmath7 ) can be changed smoothly from parallel ( @xmath17 ) to anti - parallel @xmath46 by varying the bias current through the interval @xmath47 .",
    "this corresponds to moving along the @xmath48 branch of the ivc .",
    "the dependence of the magnetization direction @xmath7 on the current flowing through the stack is shown in fig .",
    "[ theta - i ] .    in the voltage - bias regime , on the other hand , where the resistance of the stack is much larger than the resistance of the rest of the circuit , @xmath49 , the voltage across the stack @xmath27 is kept at a given value approximately equal to the bias voltage .",
    "since the ivc is s - shaped , the stack can now be in a bistable state : in the voltage range between points @xmath14 and @xmath50 there are three possible values of the current for one fixed value of voltage ( see fig .",
    "[ cvc ] ) .",
    "the states of the stack with the lowest and the highest currents are stable , while the state of the stack with the middle value of the current is unstable .",
    "therefore , a change of the voltage results in a hysteresis loop : an increase of the voltage along the @xmath51 branch of the ivc leaves the magnetization directions in the stack parallel ( @xmath17 ) up to point @xmath50 , where the current jumps to the upper branch @xmath52 , the jump being accompanied by a fast switching of the stack magnetization from the parallel ( @xmath53 ) to the antiparallel orientation ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "a decrease of the voltage along the @xmath54 ivc branch keeps the stack magnetization antiparallel up to point @xmath14 , where the current jumps to the lower @xmath51 branch of the ivc and the magnetization of the stack returns to the parallel orientation ( @xmath17 ) .    in the next section",
    "we show that if the stack is connected in parallel with a capacitor , and the capacitance exceeds some critical value , the above time independent state becomes unstable and spontaneous temporal oscillations appear in the values of the current , voltage across the stack , temperature , and direction of the magnetization .",
    "we consider now a situation where the magnetic stack under investigation is incorporated into an electrical circuit in parallel with a capacitor of capacitance @xmath55 and the circuit is biased by a dc current @xmath56 , illustrated by the equivalent circuit of fig .",

    "the thermal and electrical processes in this system are governed by the set of equations @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the heat capacity .",

    "first ; the blocking temperature of the two antiferromagnetic layers can be designed in fabrication such that one is lower than the other , @xmath136 or @xmath137 @xcite . by heating the sample to a temperature above the lower blocking temperature @xmath138 ( @xmath139 ) but below the higher blocking temperature @xmath139 ( @xmath138 ) ,",
    "the magnetization of fm 1 ( fm 2 ) can be rotated by applying an external field . with fm 1 and fm 2",

    "at this temperature the ferromagnet with lower coercivity , fm 1 ( fm 2 ) , can be rotated in an external field if @xmath141 ( @xmath142 ) , where @xmath143 is the applied field . with fm 1 and fm 2",

    "below , we demonstrate the second method for obtaining an inverse gmr spin - valve using a practical material stack .",

    ", the magnetization and switching fields of fm 1 and fm 2 could be monitored while the temperature was increased . at 180@xmath146c",
    "the temperature was higher than both @xmath138 and @xmath139 which made it possible to align fm 1 and fm 2 antiparallel ( since @xmath145 ) .",

    "the magnetoresistance has now become inverse which means that the resistance decreases when a positive field is applied .",
    "the coercivity of fm 2 chosen for this demonstration of differential exchange pinning has increased somewhat as a result of the field - heat treatment .",
    "this issue should yield to optimization of the material stack and working with smaller blocking temperatures .    as regards to the size of the integrated oscillator ,",
    "let us assume the typical resistance of the ste - valve to be 50 ohm and the operating frequency @xmath147 ghz , and estimate the required inductance @xmath148 and capacitance @xmath55 of the circuit .",
    "thus , @xmath149 ohm yields @xmath150 h while @xmath151 ohm yields @xmath152 f. the typical inductance of an on - chip inductor is 1 nh per mm of the wire length , somewhat enhanced if the wire is turned in to a spiral . therefore the required chip area would be millimeters squared in size . a square parallel plate capacitor , estimated using the standard formula , for a typical dielectric material of a few nm thick insulator would measure 10 micrometers on the side .",
    "obviously , a 10,000-fold reduction in the typical footprint should be achievable in principle by employing a device based on an s - shaped ste - valve . in systems where tunability and high power are desirable , the n - shaped inductor based design may be preferable .",
    "we have shown that joule heating of an exchange - spring nanopillar with an inverse magneto - resistance results in a mutual coupling of the current and orientation of the switching layer .",
    "this allows to control the magnetic alignment in the stack in the full range of angles from parallel to antiparallel by varying the current through the structure .",
    "we have determined the range of parameters in which the current - voltage characteristic of the exchange - spring nanopillar with inverse magneto - resistance is s - shaped and evaluated a spin - thermionic oscillator whoose frequency can be varied by changing the capacitance in the circuit from essentially dc to the ghz range . a suitable material stack and method to produce the required inverse - gmr spin - valve is demonstrated .",
