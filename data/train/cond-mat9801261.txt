    "when a nonlinear system is driven by a periodic force in a noisy environment , its response may be enhanced by the presence of noise . this constructive role played by noise",
    "can be characterized by the appearance of a maximum in the so called signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) at a nonzero noise level .",
    "in essence , the snr is a quantity that reflects the quality of the output signal , in such a way that for large values of this quantity the output signal looks more ordered .",
    "this phenomenon , named stochastic resonance ( sr ) has been found in many situations pertaining to different scientific areas .    in regards to neural systems ,",
    "many examples of sr has been found theoretically in single neurons @xcite and neural networks @xcite , and experimentally in single neurons @xcite .",
    "in contrast , an aspect which has only been considered recently is the appearance of sr in neural excitable media @xcite . in a set of experiments with mammalian brain slices corresponding to the hippocampal center",
    "@xcite it was demonstrated that an electric field can either suppress or enhance coherent activity in real networks .",
    "it was later shown , by using a time - varying electric field , that as the magnitude of the stochastic component of the field was increased , sr was observed in the response of the neural network to a weak periodic signal @xcite .",
    "these and other recent results @xcite clearly shows that neural noise could play a relevant role in the information processing of the brain .",
    "in this context , both key ingredients for sr , i.e. a well - defined coherent and time - periodic modulation and intrinsic noise , are present at several scales in neural tissues .",
    "we can consider a coarse - grained characterization of brain dynamics by means of the analysis of the electroencephalogram , which is an averaged measure of the spatiotemporal activity of millions of neurons .",
    "these neurons , in turn , are part of a network receiving inputs from various parts of the nervous system called nuclei . among these ,",
    "the thalamus plays a very important role in controlling the behavioral states of the brain @xcite .",
    "in fact , the thalamus is known to display autonomous oscillations @xcite , i.e. it works as some kind of pacemaker to the brain cortex .",
    "the thalamus is massively connected with the cortex and produces autonomous periodic oscillations , even when disconnected from the cortex .",
    "hence , the cortex can be , to some extent , viewed as a highly connected network which is periodically stimulated by the thalamic pacemaker .",
    "several experimental results give support to the idea that the behavioral states of the brain ( alpha rhythm , slow delta waves , sleep , and rem ) are somehow related to an oscillatory input into the cortical tissue@xcite .",
    "these facts indicate that a realistic model of cortical dynamics should consider the effects of the thalamo - cortical pacemaker , which can be simulated in different ways , but it can always be considered as a periodic external signal .",
    "another aspect to be emphasized is the fact that single neurons of the cortex exhibit some degree of variability , i.e. the response to a stimulus depends on the particular trial , which is observed in single - neuron experiments and also in measurements of single - neurons inside the brain .",
    "such a variability comes from both complex deterministic dynamics and the noise implicit in the random nature of the incoming signals . additionally , single neurons manifest intrinsic noise . in this sense ,",
    "there have been numerous experimental studies about the stochastic activity of nerve cells .",
    "noise has been observed in nerve - cell preparations and involves both synaptic noise , which is due to randomly occurring synaptic potentials @xcite , and membrane noise . in the last case , small fluctuations in the electric potential across the nerve - cell membrane",
    "are observed , even when apparently steady conditions prevail .",
    "these fluctuations are linked with conductance changes induced by random closing and opening of ion channels .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study a simple model which is able to capture the main traits of the actual neural media , as concerns the interplay between noise and periodic modulation in neural dynamics . to this purpose",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of a standard mean field model of neural excitable medium which was introduced in a preliminary form in ref . @xcite .",
    "the paper has been organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] we present the mean field model . in sections",
    "[ sec3 ] and [ sec4 ] , we analyze the appearance of sr in two different situations concerning oscillations of the resistance of the neural tissue and variation of the threshold .",
    "finally , in section [ sec5 ] we summarize our main results and discuss possible implications in neural systems .",
    "let us consider a slab of neural tissue comprising a very large number of closely packed and coupled nerve cells , where connections are only excitatory .",
    "different parts of the neocortex can fit this description with more or less success .",
    "in general , most of the real networks formed in the brain cortex are constituted by both excitatory and inhibitory neurons . the frequency and relevance of each type of cell , however , vary depending on the place considered . in this sense ,",
    "the overall activity of some brain regions , like the thalamus , is largely dominated by the excitatory component @xcite , usually identified , at the microscopic level , with the piramidal cells .",
    "this excitatory behavior is particularly relevant in the hippocampus , when stimulation of a single excitatory neuron can generate a burst of synchronous activity @xcite .",
    "these results makes the consideration of the behavior of cortical nets in terms of purely excitable dynamics reasonable , as a first approximation .",
    "in addition , the lack of a microscopic structure is not an important problem when neurons and connections are not explicitly considered as discrete entities , as done at our level of description . in this regard , previous studies reveal that the mean - field approach is able to reproduce the detailed macroscopic description @xcite .",
    "the situation we consider involves one of the simplest models of aggregates of nerve cells . at a given spatial point @xmath0 ,",
    "the quantity of interest is the mean local potential @xmath1 which is the result of a local integration of incoming signals , i. e. @xmath2 over a given neighborhood @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the local packing density of neurons and @xmath5 the transmenbrane potential .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath6 can be obtained from the following integrodifferential equation @xmath7 here c is the capacitance , r the resistance , @xmath8 a stimulus and @xmath9 the mean number of synaptic connections .",
    "the functional form of @xmath10 is defined through the sigmoidal relation : @xmath11^{-1 } \\;\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are given constants and @xmath14 is a threshold .",
    "many possible functional forms for @xmath9 can be considered , as for example an exponential decay @xmath15 which leads to the equation : @xmath16^{-1 } d{\\vec { r^\\prime } } \\\\ & + & i({\\vec r},t ) \\;\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    we will consider the case of all - to - all connectivity , i. e. @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the characteristic length scale . under this assumption",
    ", the model of neural excitable medium constitutes a mean field approximation and is formulated by the equation@xcite @xmath19 accounting for the dynamics of the spatial average @xmath20 of the transmembrane potential . here",
    "@xmath21 is a constant that arises from that approximation .",
    "this model is referred to as the cowan - ermentrout model ( cem ) .",
    "its dynamics can be described through a potential function @xmath22 , @xmath23 in our case , @xmath24 \\;\\ ; .\\ ] ] a remarkable fact is that for some values of the parameters , cem exhibits bistability .",
    "therefore , small changes in the parameter values can lead to sudden shifts from one stable branch to the other @xcite .    to render our analysis of the mean field model complete ,",
    "we need to specify the nature of the noise .",
    "it is worth pointing out that its origin , its characterization , and its effects in actual neural media inside the brain is far from being clear . here , in order to account for the noise effects , we will consider a simplified situation that can be described by a fluctuating current applied to the net .",
    "moreover , we assume that this current may be approximated by a gaussian white noise [ @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "another remarkable fact is that periodic modulations may affect the system in different ways , for instance , by periodically changing the value of one of the parameters .",
    "thus , small changes in the permeability of a suitable ion gives rise to variations of the membrane resistance @xmath27 . electric fields may cause shifts in the effective threshold @xmath14 for an action potential initiation .",
    "the parameter @xmath14 could also change when stimulus are sent to the medium from other regions , e.g. when two networks interact .",
    "here we will explicitly consider these two cases , i.e. oscillations of the resistance and variations of the threshold , although other possibilities could also be analyzed .",
    "as a source of periodic modulation , we will first focus on the oscillations of the membrane resistance . in order to proceed with our analysis , we will consider the fokker - planck equation giving the probability density of the spatial averaged transmenbrane potential .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we introduce the new set of variables : @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 . in these variables ,",
    "the fokker - planck equation reads @xmath33 + d{\\partial^2 p \\over \\partial x ^2 } \\;\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath34 , with @xmath35 $ ] , is the linear force and @xmath36^{-1}$ ] accounts for the nonlinear contribution .",
    "@xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are constant parameters .    the probability density can be expanded in powers of the strength of the nonlinear term ; namely , @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 corresponds to the linearized equation whereas the remaining terms account for corrections due to the nonlinearity . substituting this expansion in eq .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that , for noise levels close to the optimum value , the time series look as those corresponding to the usual bistable quartic potential @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed how noise affects the behavior of a neural medium when it is periodically modulated .",
    "we have found that the occurrence of noise may play a constructive role since an optimized amount of it may contribute to enhancing the response of the system . under some circumstances ,",
    "the presence of noise is responsible for the appearance of oscillations which otherwise would not be manifested . in this regard",
    ", the analysis of macroscopic neural dynamics obtained from electroencephalograms has been a matter of debate over the last decade @xcite .",
    "it is accepted that the activity of the brain cortex shows low - dimensional traits , though the exact nature of the phenomenon itself is far from being clear .",
    "here we have shown that noise , sometimes not considered , could give rise to a coherent behavior of the system , then playing an important role in neural dynamics .",
    "the mean field model we have proposed , although constituting an oversimplified picture of a thalamo - cortical network , might be a first step in our understanding of how noise and nonlinearities can generate interesting macroscopic outcomes .",
    "further developments must include spatial effects as well as the consideration of activatory and inhibitory populations of neurons .    on what concerns to the phenomenon of sr itself , an important aspect that should be emphasized",
    "is the fact that the model we have presented exhibits sr in both monostable and bistable situations , depending on the values of the parameters .",
    "this remarkable feature contrasts with previous studies for which sr has been found only for monostable or bistable systems .",
    "moreover , some bistable systems undergoing sr may become monostable , but under this circumstance sr does not take place .",
    "in fact , the model under consideration describes a system with a threshold , accounting for the firing of the neurons that may behave as a monostable or a bistable system .",
    "therefore , we have envisaged a model that may exhibit three different situations ( monostable , bistable , and threshold ) where the phenomenon occurs .",
