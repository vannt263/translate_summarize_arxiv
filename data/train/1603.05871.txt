    "the impact of a solid sphere on a liquid surface is a scientific problem that has attracted a considerable interest since the early observations of worthington @xcite of the dynamics of the cavity formed in the wake of the sphere .",
    "this problem has recently attracted a renewed interest and the cavity dynamics has been studied in detail by various authors @xcite .",
    "water entry is indeed an important problem for various applications , including aerospace science @xcite where plane impacts have served as an early motivation @xcite , naval engineering @xcite or more recently animal locomotion @xcite .    in most of the applications cited above",
    ", the force exerted on the impacting body by the fluid results mainly from an inertial response .",
    "this means that other types of effects such as surface tension , gravity or viscosity are negligible . for an object of characteristic size @xmath0 , impacting on a liquid surface ( density @xmath1 ,",
    "kinematic viscosity @xmath2 , surface tension @xmath3 ) with a velocity @xmath4 , the weber number that measures the ratio between inertia and surface tension @xmath5 and the reynolds number @xmath6 are very large in the context of these applications .",
    "the case of small weber numbers  _ i.e. _ surface tension dominated impacts  has also been studied in the context of the locomotion of small organisms @xcite .",
    "small weber numbers are obtained for small objects or when the surface tension is large .",
    "the latter situation is encountered in particular when an elastic membrane is at the interface between the liquid and the gas as for a liquid filled rubber balloon @xcite . in this case , the tension in the thin rubber membrane results from the internal pressure in the balloon and it can be several orders of magnitude larger than the typical value for the water / air interface . provided that the initial tension is large and the amplitude of the motion of the surface of the balloon is small , the analogy with a liquid - gas interface is straightforward .",
    "however , in the general case , the tension in the membrane varies with its local strain typically through hooke s law .",
    "therefore the surface tension coefficient is in general not uniform : it is a dynamical variable that changes with the longitudinal ( or tangential ) motion of the membrane .",
    "similar situations are encountered in the case of liquid - gas interfaces in the presence of surfactants , where longitudinal motion at the interface may change the local concentration of surfactants and thus the surface tension @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we investigate a situation in which a floating membrane acts locally like a liquid - gas interface with a very large surface tension coefficient compared to a liquid - gas interface , such that , for our experiments , the weber number is smaller than @xmath7 .",
    "the reynolds number is still very large , which allows us to neglect viscous effects .",
    "gravity can also be neglected .",
    "the membrane is initially flat and tension - free ( the small background stress imposed by the liquid - air surface tension at the side of the membrane can be neglected ) . in this case",
    "the surface tension coefficient is not known _ a priori _ , and it results from a coupling between the transverse motion ( throughout the text , transverse refers to the direction normal to the initially flat interface ) resulting from the impact and the stretching of the membrane that builds up following the impact .",
    "because of this coupling and because the background stress is negligible , the problem is considerably more difficult than the classical problem of wave propagation on stretched membranes @xcite . in the absence of a liquid substrate , the dynamics has been investigated by various authors in the context of ballistic impacts @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that the displacement in the plane of the membrane and the transverse displacement are strongly coupled and need to be determined concomitantly .",
    "furthermore the analysis has shown that the axisymmetric wave propagation can be unstable and that wrinkles resulting from a buckling instability appear .    in a recent paper",
    ", we have investigated the two - dimensional problem @xcite of a thin floating membrane , made of natural rubber , being impacted by a horizontal metal rod . in this context , the stretching response of the membrane is of the same nature as liquid - gas surface tension , but shows a surface tension coefficient increasing linearly with the impact velocity .",
    "this two - dimensional coupled dynamics between the membrane and the liquid ( water ) on which it floats , exhibits self - similar solutions like the ones observed for a liquid - gas interface @xcite .",
    "this surprising fact results from the uniform state of strain in the membrane , allowing for a straightforward analogy between an impacted membrane and a fluid interface . in the present paper",
    ", we investigate axisymmetric situations , for which the simplification of a uniform membrane stress does not hold .",
    "indeed , when a metal ball or a vertical cylinder impacts the membrane , the resulting strain in the membrane , and therefore the related stresses , are highly non - uniform , as we shall see .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : exp ] we describe the experiments and the phenomenology of the impacted membrane : in particular we emphasize the propagation of two distinct waves , a wave associated with the in - plane motion of material points of the membrane , that is decoupled from the hydrodynamics , and a transverse wave that is accompanied by fluid motion .",
    "the wave dynamics is addressed in details in section [ sec : waves ] , then the static membrane equations are solved numerically in section [ sec : strain ] in order to understand the scaling for the strain observed in the experiments .",
    "section [ sec : wrinkling ] discusses the wrinkling instability of the membrane that develops as the waves propagate and section [ sec : deceleration ] discusses the deceleration of the impactor .",
    "a steel impactor with a hemispherical head of radius @xmath8 or @xmath9 or @xmath10 mm , impacts transversally a thin rubber membrane ( thickness @xmath11 in the range @xmath12 to @xmath13 mm ) floating at the surface of a water tank of dimensions @xmath14 @xmath15 .",
    "impactors are accelerated by gravity or by a gas gun and they impact the membrane at speeds in the range @xmath16 to @xmath17 m / s .",
    "experiments addressing the wave dynamics ( in particular at low impact speeds ) are conducted with impacting cylinders , that are sufficiently heavy to ensure that the impactor does not decelerate during the experiment .",
    "the membrane is a circular or square sheet of typical dimension ( diameter or side length ) of @xmath18 cm .",
    "the shape of the membrane is not relevant since we focus on short - time dynamics , before waves have had time to interact with the boundary .",
    "the typical duration of an experiment is less than @xmath19 ms and the dynamics is recorded with a high - speed camera at typical frame rates of 10000 frames per second .",
    "the membrane is characterized by a stretching modulus @xmath20 with @xmath21 where @xmath22 is young s modulus , @xmath23 is the poisson ratio and @xmath11 the thickness of the membrane in the reference state .",
    "the natural rubber used in the experiments has a young modulus @xmath24 mpa , and a stretching rate of 500@xmath25 or more can be reached . for simplicity and since most of the dynamics occurs at low stretching ( below 10@xmath25 except in a small area near the impactor ) , we will assume that the material response can be accurately described by hooke s law ( see @xcite for references to more complex models in the context of impacts ) .",
    "a typical value of the stretching modulus is @xmath26",
    "thus , even for low strains @xmath27 of the order of @xmath28 , the stresses induced by strains @xmath29 are well above the stress resulting from surface tension at the liquid - air interface and the latter will be neglected throughout this work .",
    "after impact , two waves propagate on the membrane ( figure  [ fig : picts ] ) .",
    "they are clearly seen on a spatiotemporal diagram showing the position of material points as a function of time . a material point located at a distance @xmath30 from the impact point",
    "is first reached by a longitudinal wave front . behind this wavefront ,",
    "the material point moves in the plane of the membrane towards the impact point .",
    "the displacement is radial and is denoted @xmath31 . at later times ,",
    "the material points move in the transverse direction , the transverse displacement being denoted @xmath32 , experiencing first an oscillation of growing amplitude and later a strong transverse motion first upward and then downward towards the liquid .",
    "the wavefront associated with the longitudinal motion travels at constant speed ( figure [ fig : picts]b ) . behind this longitudinal wavefront",
    ", the membrane is stretched in a non - uniform manner : the stretching increases towards the impact point .",
    "the transverse wavefront travels in the stretched domain .",
    "this out - of - plane displacement occurs in an area well delimited by a hump , which we use to define @xmath33 ( see figure [ fig : sketch ] ) .",
    "the transverse wavefront travels at a speed that decreases with time and its position is well approximated by the law @xmath34 ( figure [ fig : picts]b ) .",
    "this scaling is typical of surface tension driven flows and it has been observed for two dimensional impacts on membranes @xcite . the coefficient @xmath35 changes with the impact speed .",
    "this wave dynamics will be discussed in the next section .    during its extension ,",
    "the axisymmetric wave pattern presents an instability and radial wrinkles appear , as seen in figure  [ fig : picts]a .",
    "such patterns appear frequently on elastic membranes which are not able to withstand compressive in - plane stresses @xcite . inside the cavity , wrinkles develop on the curved membrane .",
    "the number of wrinkles does not change as the cavity extends and the wrinkles extend from the vicinity of the contact with the indenter to the ridge of the cavity .",
    "outside of the cavity , radial wrinkles are also present .",
    "the number of wrinkles outside the cavity is different from the number of wrinkles inside the cavity .",

    "another difficulty associated with the self - similar approach is that it does not provide a scaling for the strain . in particular",
    ", the dependence of the strain in @xmath102 with the impact speed can not be determined without computing the full solution of the problem , which remains a formidable task .",
    "we propose in this section , a simplified analysis .    in order to explore the main features of the wave dynamics  the constant character of the strain in @xmath36 and its scaling with the impact speed  we have solved the quasi - static membrane equations ( [ eq : comp ] ) and ( [ eq : eqs2 ] ) , using a profile @xmath132 compatible with the observed self - similar shape ( [ eq : wselfsimilar ] ) .",

    "our simplified approach consists in replacing the highly complex coupling between the membrane and the fluid motion with the feature of the flow  built in equation ( [ eq : memshape ] )  that the transverse wave propagates according to @xmath136 .",

    "as seen in figure [ fig : picts ] , as the waves extend , the membrane presents an instability and wrinkles appear in two distinct domains , for @xmath170 where the membrane is out of its plane and is curved and for @xmath171 where the membrane is roughly flat ( in its nominal state _",

    "the dispersion relation for a transverse perturbation on the beam @xcite ( not accounting for added mass ) is @xmath175 and the critical wavenumber is thus given by @xmath176 , leading to a wavenumber of the instability @xmath177 this result agrees with our observations as seen in figure [ fig : wrinkling]c .",
    "we note also that , as in the absence of substrate , the wrinkling instability selects a wavelength , rather than a number of wrinkles .",
    "thus as the waves propagate , new wrinkles appear ( figures [ fig : picts ] and [ fig : wrinkling ] ) .",
    "wrinkles are also observed inside the cavity unlike in the absence of a liquid substrate where they are not observed at least for moderate impact speed ( compared to the speed of sound waves in the material ) @xcite . during an experiment",

    "the number of wrinkles is smaller inside the cavity than outside the cavity : in the last frame of figure [ fig : wrinkling ] _ a _ , the estimated number of wrinkles is 24 inside the cavity and 42 outside ( near @xmath36 ) .",
    "moreover , the variations of @xmath178 with the weber number and with the thickness @xmath179 do not agree with the scaling law ( [ eq : wrinkles ] ) . in particular",
    ", the variation of the wavelength with the thickness of the membrane shows a much weaker variation with the thickness @xmath179 if any .",

    "we note however that the model does not capture the weak dependance of the number of wrinkles with the weber number : @xmath178 increases with the weber number and @xmath203 shows a variation weaker than the expected @xmath205 .",
    "this discrepancy between the simplified model and the experimental results may be the consequence of higher order corrections in ratio @xmath206 .",

    "it is interesting to compare the dynamics of the floating membrane to the case of an impacted plate . in the present case ,",
    "the stretching at the contact with the impactor , that will ultimately ( for high speeds ) be responsible for the puncturing of the membrane , increases progressively with time with a time scale @xmath251 while the deceleration occurs at a time scale @xmath252 .",
    "this is different from the case of an impacted plate of thickness @xmath179 , characterized by its bending rigidity , where the nominal curvature @xmath253 is reached very rapidly , within the short time necessary to establish the hertzian response of the plate : this time is typically @xmath254 @xcite .",
    "we have studied the behaviour of a membrane floating on a liquid pool impacted by a rigid object .",
    "the membrane is initially stress free .",
    "tension in the membrane develops as a result of the impact and the dynamics of the transverse wave is coupled with the tension wave .",
    "we have shown that the strain distribution  and therefore the stress distribution  observed in the experiments on the membrane is fully consistent with a simplified theoretical model .",
    "this model consists in the assumptions that the transverse wave front travels in the radial direction with a @xmath84 law and that the membrane is , at each instant , in internal equilibrium .",
    "this model allowed us to describe the shape of the membrane in the region of the transverse wave as a self - similar function , analog to surface - tension - dominated free - surface flows .",
    "the equivalent local surface tension coefficient , derived from the theory , is constant in time and increases like the weber number to the power @xmath168 as observed in the experiments .",
    "moreover , the theoretical expression for the strain in the transverse wave region gives a scaling for the wavelength of the wrinkles observed at long - time , which is in agreement with the experiments .",
    "finally , the model allows us to understand the deceleration of the impactor  : the agreement between the theory and the experiments is fairly good in this purpose .",
    "we leave here , as a perspective of this work , a deeper experimental study of the deceleration of the impactor and the wrinkles growth . in order to conclude on this aspect",
    ", we shall need to change the material properties ( thickness of the membrane and young s modulus , though the domain of variations is limited by the bending response that will unavoidably affects the wave dynamics for thick or rigid membranes ) and the liquid properties ( density , kinematic viscosity ) in order to disentangle this complex long - time dynamics .",
    "one remaining open question that this future work should address is the amount of energy transfer during the impact .",
    "indeed , quantifying the energy transferred into kinetic energy ( inside the fluid ) and elastic energy ( in the membrane ) should have many applications .",
