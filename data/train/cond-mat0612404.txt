    "many astrophysical objects such as planets , satellites , and space crafts can be regarded as rigid bodies@xcite .",
    "much recent work has been devoted to devising time - reversible and symplectic numerical integrators for rigid systems@xcite . in this paper , we present second and fourth order symplectic integration schemes for general interacting rigid bodies that make use of a recent numerical implementation of the exact solution of free rigid bodies@xcite .",
    "the schemes do not require specifying orientational parameters such as euler angles , nor extending the state space , nor the use of quaternions and constraint conditions , and have a symplectic structure on the standard phase space of rigid systems .",
    "besides being aesthetically appealing , the schemes are more efficient at a given level of accuracy in many cases , and never less efficient .",

    "a related quantity is the angular momentum @xmath12 , whose importance lies in the fact that the total angular momentum @xmath13 is a conserved quantity in rotationally symmetric systems . here , @xmath14 is the moment of inertia tensor @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the principal moments of inertia .",

    "these forces then determine the body forces and torques :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the number of interaction sites on body @xmath1 .",
    "the proposed algorithm to integrate eqs. is based on the exact solution of torque - free dynamics and will be presented first , after which its derivation will be given .    in the algorithm ,",
    "each body @xmath1 is specified by the set @xmath29 , and two different evolution operators are defined . the first is the exact free evolution operator @xmath30 over a time @xmath31 , under which @xmath32 and @xmath33 are invariant while @xmath3 and @xmath4 evolve according to :    @xmath34    where the matrix @xmath35 ( specified below ) propagates @xmath4 from time @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",

    "both @xmath30 in eq . and @xmath38 in eq .",
    "_ strictly _ conserve the angular momentum vector @xmath125 for spherically symmetric systems .",
    "the conservation of @xmath125 under @xmath30 arises because @xmath32 is a constant of the exact free motion , whereas the equality @xmath126 is a consequence of the rotational invariance of the potential @xmath25 .",
    "due to translational invariance , the momentum @xmath127 is also conserved .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      to demonstrate the advantage of the sier integrators for an asymmetric body , simulations were performed on an isolated rigid body , whose moments of inertia are those of a water molecule , with initial conditions drawn from a canonical distribution at 297k . for comparison , simulations were also performed using the mrdl scheme of mclachlan , reich , dullweber and leimkuhler@xcite and the so - called _",
    "sej4 _ scheme of celledoni and sfstrm@xcite .",
    "the advantage of considering free rigid body is that the exact motion is known and can be used to measure the deviation in the trajectories in addition to checking violations of energy conservation .",
    "the energy is in fact insensitive to the orientation and the violations of energy conservation turn out to be small for all the integrations methods . to show that this does not mean that all methods are equally accurate , as an alternative error estimate",
    ", we used @xmath128 \\rangle^{1/2}$ ] , with @xmath129 the exact result@xcite . while @xmath130 for @xmath131 , @xmath132 for a random rotation matrix @xmath106 .",
    "numerically it is found that the error scales as @xmath133 for moderate @xmath36 , where @xmath134 is the time at which the error in @xmath135 becomes 10% .",
    "hence @xmath134 can be viewed as the time scale at which the orientation of the body is incorrectly calculated .",
    "this time scale depends on the time step @xmath31 and the scheme used . for @xmath136fs , the time scale at which the orientation becomes inaccurate",
    "is @xmath137ps using mrdl , while sej4 gives @xmath138@xmath139s , and sier2 gives @xmath140 ms ( sier2 and sier4 have similar accuracy here ) .",
    "given that in gases at standard conditions , typical free flight times are on the order of 100ps , one might still consider the error in mrdl acceptable in such applications .",
    "however , time steps as large as 8 fs are possible for such systems@xcite . for this time step ,",
    "the time scale at which the orientation becomes inaccurate in the mrdl method is @xmath141ps .",
    "thus , the orientation would incorrectly given by mrdl well before a free flight is over , even though the violations in the energy conservation are small ( @xmath142 0.01% ) .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , then , the time step that can be used in mrdl simulations of a low density system is limited _ not _ by interaction parameters but by the accuracy of the free flight . on the other hand ,",
    "sej4 gives @xmath143ns , and sier2 gives @xmath144ms , so both give orientations which are still accurate after a free flight . in terms of computational load , for a fixed time step , sier2 was between 70% and 100% slower than mrdl , while sej4 was another 20% slower still .",
    "thus sej4 is slower and less accurate than sier2 . and while mrdl is roughly twice faster for given @xmath31 , this can not make up for the loss in accuracy .      to test the sier integrators on a non - free body",
    ", a constant electric field of @xmath145 mv / m directed along the @xmath61-axis is introduced with which the water molecule interact via its dipole moment of 1.84 debye .",
    "the strength of the electric field corresponds to that induced by a second water molecule at a distance of 7   . since the exact motion of the molecule",
    "is not known for this case , more conventional measures for accuracy are used . in table[table1 ] , the rms fluctuations of two conserved quantities , the total energy @xmath146 and the @xmath61-component of the angular momentum vector , @xmath147 , are given for different time steps for the sier integrators and compared with the mrdl scheme and the sej4 scheme .",
    "note that the fluctuations of @xmath148 are given relative to the fluctuations of the potential energy @xmath149 ( a natural scale of energy fluctuations ) , while the fluctuations of @xmath147 are given relative to the average @xmath147 .",
    "for an equitable comparison , the relative accuracies of the simulations were compared as a function of @xmath150 , where @xmath151 is the number of force evaluations per time - step . for mrdl , sej4 , and sier2 , @xmath152 , while @xmath153 for sier4 .",
    "we note that the relative real - time computational loads are comparable to those in the free case .",
    "it is evident from table [ table1 ] that sier2 has the same degree of energy conservation as sej4 , outperforming mrdl in this respect .",
    "however , sier2 and mrdl conserve @xmath147 equally well since the mrdl scheme also conserves the angular momentum exactly . on the other hand ,",
    "the conservation of @xmath147 in the sej4 scheme is orders of magnitude worse than the other propagation schemes , casting doubt on the accuracy of its rotational dynamics .",
    "thus , sier2 combines the excellent energy conservation of sej4 with the exact angular momentum conservation of mrdl .",
    "in addition , sier4 improves the energy conservation for @xmath150 below a threshold value of about 12fs .      in simulations of high density liquids ,",
    "one expects the free flight to be less important , and the advantages of using sier less .",
    "however , one still expects sier4 to give better results than sier2 . to test this ,",
    "simulations were also performed on a system of 512 water molecules at liquid density at a temperature of 297  k@xcite . to ensure strict energy conservation , a smooth molecular cut - off of 11",
    "  was employed . for the simulations ,",
    "time steps ranging from @xmath154fs to @xmath155fs were used ( above which one sees a substantial energy drift ) .",
    "the results for sier2 and sier4 are shown in fig.[energy ] .",
    "mrdl and sej4 simulations were also performed , but their results as well as their real - time computational loads were virtually indistinguishable from those of sier2 , and therefore not plotted in fig.[energy ] .",
    "thus , from the perspective of energy conservation , sier2 performs as well as mrdl and sej4 here , although the trajectories are likely to be more accurate ( as in the free case ) . from fig.[energy ] , it is evident that below @xmath156fs , sier4 is more accurate than sier2 , although its theoretical scaling of @xmath157 for small @xmath31 is frustrated by round - off errors@xcite .    . ]",
    "in this paper , two symplectic , time - reversible algorithms for simulating rigid body dynamics were presented , sier2 and sier4 , which are of second and fourth order , respectively .",
    "the schemes do not use constraint conditions , nor an extended state space , nor euler angles or quaternions , but instead make use of a recent implementation of the exact solution of free rigid body motion .",
    "the integrators conserve the symplectic structure on the conventional phase space of rigid systems and respect conservation laws of linear and angular momentum exactly when applicable .",
    "numerical comparisons with two existing integration methods ( mrdl and sej4 ) were performed for three systems : a free asymmetric rigid body , a water molecule in an external field , and liquid water . in the free case , a comparison with the exact trajectory was possible , which showed that the orientational dynamics given by the sier schemes is superior to existing integration schemes at a given numerical cost . for the water molecule in an external field ,",
    "the accuracy of the trajectories was assessed using the conserved quantities of energy and the @xmath61-component of the angular momentum . here too , the sier schemes performed better at a given numerical cost . for the simulation of water at liquid densities , the energy conservation of the sier methods is equal to that of the other integrators , due to the dominance of the forces in the accumulated error . nonetheless , the trajectories are likely to be more accurate , because the free motion step in the integrator is performed exactly .",
    "the integrators presented here should be of use in astrophysical simulations in which accuracy is important as well as in simulations of biomolecular and other systems in chemical physics , which often require propagation of many degrees of freedom to long time scales .",
