    "in a note to the second edition of his book on statistical thermodynamics @xcite , schrdinger suggests that thermodynamical functions can not be based on the gratuitous allegation that quantum - mechanical levels ( typically the orthogonal eigenstates of the hamiltonian operator ) are the only allowed states in statistical thermodynamics . in khinchin s classical book on the mathematical foundations of quantum statistics ( sec .",
    "2 of chap  iii of @xcite ) an approach to microcanonical averages is proposed in line with schrdinger s suggestion .",
    "landau and lifshitz @xcite also consider unrealistic the possibility of preparing isolated macroscopic physical systems in a precise energy eigenstate , since energy levels are too close to each other to select just one .    from these points of view",
    ", it seems then natural to consider the description of quantum statistical systems in terms of probability densities defined on the space of physical states .",
    "this description offers the possibility of considering the weight of a given state in an analogous manner to what it is done when describing classical statistical systems .",
    "the approach also offers many advantages in the description of hybrid quantum - classical systems , as it can be seen in @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is important to keep in mind that these distributions are ambiguous from the physical point of view .",
    "indeed , it is well known since von neumann @xcite that the physical properties of a quantum system are encoded univocally in its density matrix @xmath0 , but there are many different equivalent expressions for @xmath1 as a sum of pure states ( projectors ) . therefore",
    ", we may define entirely different distributions on the space of states , which nevertheless are equivalent because they lead to the same density matrix .    in refs .",
    "@xcite brody et al .",
    ", propose their quantum microcanonical postulate which asserts that every quantum state possessing the same energy expectation value must be realized with the same probability .",
    "brody and coworkers also introduce an alternative quantum canonical distribution and studied some of its properties . the distribution is defined as a density on the space of pure quantum states that assigns to each state the boltzmann weight associated with the expectation value of the hamiltonian .",
    "these ideas have been adopted with different degrees of intensity by several authors in the last years using even different distributions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for some examples ) . in this work",
    "we focus on the particular state - space distribution introduced in refs .",
    "@xcite and , following jona - lasinio and presilla , we refer to it as the schrdinger - gibbs ( sg ) distribution .",
    "a crucial result of this construction is that , as suggested by fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite , the third law of thermodynamics may not be satisfied .",
    "therefore it is desirable to know why this happens and whether some other essential properties of the equilibrium thermodynamics , such as the definition of consistent extensive magnitudes , are maintained when using the sg distribution .    in this work",
    "we prove that , when considered on composite noninteracting quantum systems , this distribution defines partition functions that do not factorize as products of partition functions of the subsystems , even in the thermodynamical regime .",
    "this implies that it is not possible to define extensive thermodynamical magnitudes such as the free energy , the internal energy or the thermodynamic entropy by using these models .",
    "therefore , although schrdinger s suggestion might seem reasonable a priori and it could have interesting dynamical features ( as can be learned from some of the references above ) , it can not be used to construct an appropriate quantum thermodynamics ; at least not if the suggestion is materialized in the form of the sg distribution used as an equilibrium distribution .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : two - canon - ensembl ] we review the traditional canonical distribution as well as the sg distribution , and we discuss the different alternative forms to present them .",
    "section [ sec : quant - prop - boltzm ] studies the quantum properties associated with the density matrix that encodes the properties of the sg distribution , in particular that it commutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "section [ sec : therm - prop - boltzm ] and section [ sec : orig - non - extens ] contain the main result of the paper : we prove that the partition function of the new quantum ensemble does not factorize in the case of composite noninteracting systems . in section [ sec : additivity - entropy ] we present a simple model to exemplify our analysis , and discuss it from several points of view .",
    "namely , we evaluate the partition function , the possible definitions of thermodynamic extensive magnitudes , and an alternative description in terms of density matrices . in both approaches",
    "we identify the lack of factorizability and one of its causes : basically , that the density matrix associated with the sg distribution represents an entangled state . in section [ sec : conclusions ] , we briefly summarize the content of the paper and consider the potential impact of our analysis on the study of the equilibrium and non - equilibrium statistics of hybrid quantum - classical systems .",
    "consider a physical system on a hilbert space @xmath2 of dimension @xmath3 .",
    "we define the dynamics by a hamiltonian @xmath4 . in this context , the traditional quantum canonical ensemble ( qce , see standard textbooks such as ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) is the ensemble defined by the density matrix @xmath5 where the partition function @xmath6 is defined as @xmath7    one may alternatively arrive at ensemble definitions by establishing first a probability distribution @xmath8 on the hilbert space @xmath2 with respect to the canonical volume element @xmath9 , or equivalently , a probability distribution @xmath10 on the projective space @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the orthogonal projector onto the one - dimensional subspace generated by state @xmath13 .",
    "these distributions can then be used to define the ensembles , i.e. , to construct the density matrices : given any probability distribution @xmath14 defined on the state space , the corresponding density matrix is given by : @xmath15 where @xmath16 represents a ( dynamically ) invariant measure on @xmath11 .",
    "different distributions @xmath14 and @xmath17 may lead to the same density matrix , and must then be considered equivalent .",
    "this is just reflecting the well known ambiguity in the definition of a density matrix : given a density matrix @xmath0 , there are infinitely many ways of writing it as a convex combination of rank - one projectors",
    ".    one may now prove that the average value of an arbitrary quantum observable @xmath18 , can be calculated as ( see @xcite ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "however the result is exactly the same if we compute @xmath21 where @xmath0 is eq .",
    "( [ equation3 ] )",
    ".    one can construct one of such probability distributions to obtain the quantum canonical ensemble @xmath22 .",
    "let us begin with a distribution defined on the hilbert space as : @xmath23 with the partition function @xmath24 where @xmath25 represent the energy eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath4 and @xmath26 the corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "of course , as we mentioned above , this representation is not unique .",
    "if we prefer to consider the distribution as defined on the projective space @xmath11 , we have @xmath27 where now the partition function is written as : @xmath28 where @xmath16 represents an invariant measure on @xmath11 .",
    "notice that these are just the expressions for the spectral decomposition of the density matrix ( [ eq:36 ] ) written as a probability distribution on @xmath29 or @xmath11 .",
    "these distributions select , out of all states of @xmath2 ( equivalently of @xmath11 ) , only those that are eigenstates of the hamiltonian , and assigns to them the corresponding boltzmann probability .",
    "this may lead one to think that the canonical ensemble contains some kind of preference for those states , but this is not true . invoking the above - mentioned non - uniqueness , one may use a different distribution @xmath14 to construct the canonical ensemble @xmath22 , without using delta functions centered at the hamiltonian eigenstates .",
    "it could be a continuous distribution over the entire space , or even one distribution that assigns zero probability to those eigenstates .",
    "brody and coauthors ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) and jona - lasinio and presilla ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) introduced another distribution , following the seminal idea by schrdinger @xcite . the main point is to consider , instead of only one state for each eigenvalue of the hamiltonian , all physical states of @xmath2 ( or @xmath11 ) leading to the same expectation value for @xmath4 , and assign to all of them the boltzmann probability with respect to that expectation value , i.e. , @xmath30 .",
    "as we said , we will call this distribution the schrdinger - gibbs distribution and represent it as @xmath31 .",
    "notice that , by construction , @xmath31 can be thought as a direct generalization to the quantum realm of the classical canonical distribution .",
    "however , as we are going to see , its properties are different from the classical case because of the quantum nature of the states it is defined on",
    ".    the sg distribution on the hilbert space can thus be written as :    @xmath32    where now the partition function reads    @xmath33    where we denote by @xmath34 the sphere of vectors in @xmath2 of norm equal to one .",
    "this last distribution is equivalent to a distribution @xmath31 defined on the projective space @xmath11 modulo a constant factor that does not affect the resulting ensemble ( if interested see appendix [ sec : integr - proj - space ] to understand the origin of the constant factor ) .",
    "if we define the expectation value of the operator @xmath4 on projector @xmath35 as @xmath36 the distribution can be written as :    @xmath37    with partition function @xmath38    if we evaluate the density matrix associated with the distribution ( [ eq:45 ] ) ( and use the result proved in appendix [ sec : integr - proj - space ] to evaluate the integrals on the sphere @xmath34 of vectors of @xmath2 with norm equal to one ) we obtain : @xmath39    regarding the measure @xmath16 a few comments are in order .",
    "it is well known ( see @xcite and references therein ) that finite dimensional quantum systems defined on @xmath40 admit a hamiltonian structure associated with the canonical khler structure of the manifold .",
    "the schrdinger equation corresponds then to the flow of a hamiltonian vector field associated with the canonical symplectic form .",
    "therefore , the liouville theorem ensures that the corresponding symplectic volume is preserved by the dynamics , as it happens in classical mechanics . as the sphere of vectors with norm one",
    "is also preserved by the dynamics , the natural choice for @xmath16 on @xmath34 is the restriction of the symplectic volume of @xmath40 .",
    "regarding the projective space @xmath11 , again there exists a canonical khler structure on it , also preserved by the dynamics .",
    "therefore we can also consider the corresponding symplectic volume , which will also be invariant .",
    "now , what the physical origin of the differences between eq .",
    "( [ eq:36 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq:49 ] ) is .",
    "if one approaches the canonical ensemble from the microcanonical one the origin is clear .",
    "indeed , while the microcanonical in refs .",
    "@xcite is based on the postulate that every state possessing the same energy expectation value must be democratically realized ( which implements schrdinger s suggestion ) , in the traditional microcanonical ensemble , orthogonal states must be the only ones to be included in the sample space of the statistical thermodynamics .",
    "the arguments for using only orthogonal states are based on the standard theory of probability ( see for instance secs  4.5 and 4.6 of ref .",
    "@xcite and ref @xcite ) , and on the relationship between information theory and thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "let us now study the properties of the density matrix ( [ eq:49 ] ) in more detail .",
    "first of all , for technical reasons that will become clear later , we want to prove that the sg density matrix commutes with the hamiltonian and hence both operators can be diagonalized in a common eigenbasis .",
    "notice that if we consider @xmath41 as a stationary distribution corresponding to an equilibrium situation and the hamiltonian does not depend on time , the result is trivial : @xmath42\\quad \\longrightarrow \\quad \\frac{\\partial \\hat      \\rho^{sg}(t)}{\\partial t}=0 \\rightarrow [ \\hat h , \\hat    \\rho^{sg}(t)]=0.\\ ] ]    however _ a priori _ there is no reason to consider @xmath43 to be stationary . in the following , we will prove that it is indeed time - independent .",
    "the simplest way to do this is to consider a unitary evolution for @xmath44 of the form @xmath45 where , as we assume that the hamiltonian does not depend on time , @xmath46    under the same evolution , the volume element @xmath16 on @xmath34 and the expectation value of the energy @xmath47 are , because of unitarity , constant in `` time '' .",
    "thus , for any @xmath48 , we can write @xmath49 and thus , as the volume element is also preserved , we find @xmath50    consider now the expression of the density matrix @xmath41 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq:49 ] ) which we denote as @xmath51 .",
    "let us consider how the unitary evolution transforms this density matrix after an arbitrary but fixed value of time @xmath52 , i.e. , @xmath53 here @xmath54 defines a transformation on the set of states as @xmath55 which obviously preserves the sphere @xmath34 since @xmath56 and thus we can re - write eq .",
    "( [ eq:55 ] ) as @xmath57 we know that the measure is invariant , i.e. , @xmath58 and therefore , as the sphere @xmath34 is invariant and the integral runs over all normalized states , we can write @xmath59 which is the same as eq . ( [ eq:49 ] ) .",
    "hence , we have proved that @xmath60    as the value of @xmath52 was generic , we conclude that the density matrix is independent of @xmath48 and hence commutes with the hamiltonian : @xmath61=0.\\ ] ]    on a different matter , in order to compute the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq:49 ] ) , we can use the tools of complex analysis , as presented in appendix [ sec : partition - function ] .",
    "the result for the partition function is obtained in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:76]-[eq:80 ] ) . assuming that there exist @xmath62 different eigenvalues of the hamiltonian @xmath4 with degeneracies @xmath63 , the partition function is written as : @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 represents the multinomial coefficient @xmath67    notice that the traditional distribution ( [ eq:41 ] ) associated with the qce corresponds to the case where @xmath68 where @xmath69 stands for the degeneracy of the energy level @xmath70 .    from the above expressions ,",
    "we can obtain the spectral decomposition of the density matrix @xmath41 defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq:49 ] ) .",
    "indeed , we know that @xmath41 is diagonal in the energy - eigenbasis , and thus it can be written as @xmath71 where the eigenvalue @xmath72 corresponding to the eigenvector @xmath73 is equal to :    @xmath74    and @xmath75 .",
    "each @xmath72 is thus obtained as a suitable derivative of the partition function @xmath76 , as in the case of the canonical distribution : @xmath77 therefore , we just proved that the probability distribution ( [ eq:43 ] ) can be written as @xmath78 which is formally analogous to the distribution ( [ eq:41 ] ) , but with very different content because of the second term in the sum .",
    "if we write it as a density matrix we have : @xmath79 notice that the second term is such that @xmath80 and then @xmath81",
    ".    only if the functions @xmath82 were independent from the energy eigenvalues and equal to the degeneracies @xmath69 , would @xmath41 coincide with the usual canonical distribution @xmath83 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:36 ] ) .",
    "thus , given any @xmath84 , the average value of any quantum observable @xmath18 will be in general different in the ensembles and , in general , the properties of the ensembles will not coincide .",
    "we will return to this point in section [ sec : additivity - entropy ] .",
    "a similar computation for some particular cases can be found in @xcite .",
    "indeed , the authors analyze the completely non - degenerate case of a general system , and the strong coupling limit of a spin - spin interaction hamiltonian .",
    "nonetheless , the authors of @xcite do not study the implications of their results at the thermodynamic level , as we will in the next section .",
    "we have just seen how , even if @xmath31 is analogous to the canonical distribution of a classical ( continuous ) system , the quantum nature of the system it describes makes it equivalent to a quantum ensemble described by a density matrix @xmath41 that is different from the traditional canonical one .",
    "we want to check now if , despite these differences , we can still define an appropriate thermodynamics associated with the sg distribution .    in order to define a system in thermodynamical equilibrium ,",
    "we must obtain the corresponding thermodynamic magnitudes , both extensive and intensive ones , from the statistical - mechanics objects .",
    "thus , for a system described by a partition function @xmath6 , the helmholtz free energy @xmath14 ( which is the natural free energy in the canonical ensemble ) corresponds to @xmath85 the thermodynamic ( also called sometimes `` internal '' ) energy @xmath86 corresponds to the average value of the energy , which can be obtained through @xmath87 and the thermodynamic entropy @xmath88 is written as @xmath89 if the partition function @xmath6 is factorizable , the functions @xmath90 and @xmath88 are extensive magnitudes . then",
    ", the extensiveness of the functions @xmath14 , @xmath86 or @xmath88 in the present case , is equivalent to the factorizability property of the partition function @xmath76 .",
    "that is , if we consider a system defined as the composition of non - interacting subsystems , the partition function of the complete system must be written as the product of the partition function restricted to the subsystems in order to yield extensive thermodynamic functions .",
    "notice that , so far , @xmath84 represents just a parameter that is used to define the partition function and ultimately may not have any physical meaning ( for example , if the resulting thermodynamics is found to be inappropriate ) .",
    "consider then that the total hilbert space @xmath2 is equal to the tensor product of the hilbert spaces describing the corresponding subsystems , i.e. , @xmath91 with dimensions @xmath92 ( for simplicity we assume the case of finite - dimensional quantum systems ) .",
    "the dimension of @xmath2 is thus given by @xmath93 .",
    "since we assume that there is no interaction among the subsystems , the total hamiltonian is written as the sum @xmath94    as all @xmath95 commute , the tensor product of the eigenbases of the @xmath96 is an eigenbasis of the total hamiltonian @xmath97 .",
    "we thus have that each element of the total - energy eigenbasis @xmath98 of the subsystems ( with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath99 ) : @xmath100 with no loss of generality , we will assume that @xmath101    it is well known that the partition function of the canonical distribution @xmath83 in eq .  ( [ eq:36 ] ) factorizes as a product of the partition function of the subsystems ( see @xcite , sec .",
    "if we compute the partition function @xmath76 in this basis , we obtain as a result eq .",
    "( [ eq:76b ] ) .",
    "if we did the same computation restricted to the subsystem @xmath102 , we would obtain similar expressions for the partition functions @xmath103 , with the eigenvalues @xmath70 replaced by the eigenvalues @xmath104 . in order to check whether or not @xmath76 factorizes , let us consider the limit @xmath105 , where we can write that @xmath106 analogously , @xmath107    factorizability of the partition function would require that @xmath108 which implies : @xmath109    however we can immediately check that @xmath110 indeed , in the non - degenerate groundstate case , eq .",
    "( [ eq:80b ] ) becomes for @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively @xmath113 and thus it is simple to prove that @xmath114    the last inequality can be easily understood by thinking that , on the right hand side , there are only energy differences corresponding to a change in one subsystem , while , on the left hand side , all possible energy differences are considered .",
    "this being so in the limit @xmath105 is sufficient to prove that the partition function @xmath76 is not the product of the partition functions of the subsystems , and therefore that we can not define extensive magnitudes from @xmath76 .",
    "besides , this property does not depend on the number of subsystems , and therefore it is still valid in a thermodynamic limit where @xmath115 ; i.e. , we can claim that @xmath116    we thus conclude that the thermodynamic functions defined by eqs .",
    "( [ eq:86 ] ) , ( [ eq:87 ] ) or  ( [ eq:88 ] ) can not represent extensive magnitudes .",
    "in principle we may study the same problem from the point of view of the density matrix @xmath41 , but doing so in full generality becomes quite difficult from the computational point of view .",
    "we will tackle this analysis in sec .",
    "[ sec : additivity - entropy ] for the case of a specific quantum system resulting from the composition of two - level systems , and we will recover the same results obtained here but in a much simpler way .",
    "let us consider the simplest case of a composite system by assuming that we have @xmath117 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq:89 ] ) and ( [ eq:90 ] ) . we know from eq .",
    "( [ eq:50 ] ) that @xmath118 now , we want to understand the origin of this difference from a physical point of view .    the partition functions for the individual subsystems and for the composite system will read ,",
    "respectively : @xmath119 @xmath120 and @xmath121 where @xmath122 and @xmath123 represent the @xmath124-dimensional , @xmath125dimensional and @xmath126-dimensional spheres .    we can write the product of two integrals like that of eq .",
    "( [ eq:98 ] ) as @xmath127    in a basis like the one in  ( [ eq:91 ] ) , constituted by separable vectors , we have @xmath128 the separability of the vectors allows us to write    @xmath129    thus the resulting exponent is the expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath130 , evaluated at the separable points of @xmath131 .",
    "notice that in the sum above , @xmath132 runs from 1 to @xmath133 and @xmath134 from 1 to @xmath135 , in such a way that the coordinate expression of a separable state @xmath13 reads @xmath136 putting everything together , we have just proved that : @xmath137 equation ( [ eq:15 ] ) sums the same function as ( [ eq:98c ] ) , but only over the separable states of @xmath138 ; while ( [ eq:98c ] ) integrates over all states , both separable and entangled .",
    "this explains eq .",
    "( [ eq:16 ] ) from the physical point of view .",
    "if we compare this situation with the traditional canonical distribution described by eq .",
    "( [ eq:41 ] ) , we see that the delta functions would restrict the corresponding integrals to the eigenvectors of the hamiltonian @xmath4 , which , in the case of non - interacting subsystems , correspond always to separable states . in addition , the statistical weight assigned to each of these eigenstates depends only on the eigenspace . in contrast , if we think about the sg distribution in terms of the corresponding density matrix ( i.e. , using expression  ( [ eq:85 ] ) ) , we would be considering , apparently , only separable states ( the hamiltonian eigenstates participating of the spectral decomposition ) , but now the statistical weights associated with them do not factorize . therefore the density matrix ( [ eq:85 ] ) is not separable .",
    "we will illustrate this in a simple example in next section .",
    "in this section we will present numerical examples of the properties discussed in the previous section .",
    "we will analyze the two different distributions ( ( [ eq:41 ] ) and ( [ eq:44 ] ) ) for a system of @xmath139 noninteracting two - level particles whose dynamics is described by a hamiltonian of the form @xmath140 where @xmath141 stands for the identity operator in two dimensions and the one - particle hamiltonian @xmath142 can be written in the corresponding eigenbasis as @xmath143 where @xmath144 represents the energy - gap .",
    "let us now consider a basis for @xmath2 defined as the tensor product of the energy eigenbases of every two - level subsystem .",
    "thus , if we write @xmath145 for short , we have the set of vectors of the form @xmath146 we also fix an ordering for the basis : @xmath147    in this basis , it is a simple task to verify that the eigenvalues @xmath148 of the total hamiltonian @xmath97 and the corresponding degeneracies @xmath69 are given by @xmath149      our goal now is to obtain the expressions for the schrdinger - gibbs distribution corresponding to this hamiltonian .",
    "we saw that the ensemble is defined by the partition function in  ( [ eq:44 ] ) .",
    "thus , our goal is to write @xmath150 for the particular case of the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "( [ eq:30 ] ) .",
    "the simplest cases can be easily written .",
    "indeed , we can consider the case @xmath151 ( i.e. , @xmath152 ) and write eq .  ( [ eq:76b ] ) as @xmath153 analogously , the next case is @xmath154 ( or , equivalently , @xmath155 ) : @xmath156    we can immediately check that , as we proved in general , the partition function does not factorize , i.e. , @xmath157      we can also compute the corresponding entropy functions @xmath88 using eq .",

    "of course , in this case , @xmath162 must be considered just a parameter and in no way can it be identified with a physical temperature . notice",
    "that this behavior does not follow from the non - extensiveness of the ensemble , since it is present in the @xmath151 case where non - extensiveness is meaningless . as we mentioned in the previous section ,",
    "the ensemble encoded in eq ( [ eq:85 ] ) is completely different from the canonical ensemble ( [ eq:36 ] ) and therefore its properties will , in general , be different . thus it is natural that @xmath163 defines extensive thermodynamical functions while @xmath43 does not and it is also natural that the behavior in the limit @xmath164 of the corresponding entropies differ .",
    "regarding the nonextensiveness of @xmath43 , we proved in section [ sec : orig - non - extens ] that it is related to the integration over entangled states in the definition of the ensemble ( eq . [ eq:46 ] ) .",
    "we do not have a similar proof to explain the behavior of the entropy in the @xmath164 limit , but it is evident that entanglement is not the only reason .",

    "this is a property that is preserved in the usual canonical ensemble .",
    "therefore , its violation can not be considered a consequence of the quantum nature of the system but an essential property of the sg ensemble that can not be disregarded .",
    "apart from the description in terms of probability distributions , we can also describe the systems in the previous sections by their corresponding density matrices , using eq .",
    "( [ eq:85 ] ) . for the simple cases @xmath151 and @xmath154 we obtain :    @xmath174    and @xmath175 where @xmath176 and @xmath177 represent the energy eigenstates for @xmath151 , and @xmath178 and @xmath179 are the eigenstates associated with the @xmath154 case .",
    "the vectors @xmath180 and @xmath181 span the two - dimensional eigenspace with energy equal to @xmath182 in the last @xmath154 case .",
    "it is now easy to verify that @xmath183 it suffices to check that the coefficients of the projectors onto the ground state ( @xmath184 ) do not coincide .",
    "this relation translates eq .",
    "( [ eq:63 ] ) into the language of density matrices . indeed , since the hamiltonian does not introduce a coupling among the different subsystems , the tensor product of equilibrium density states representing single subsystems ( such as eq .",
    "( [ eq:17 ] ) ) , should define equilibrium density states of the composite system .",
    "this is a property that holds for the usual canonical ensemble in eq .",
    "( [ eq:36 ] ) , but fails for the sg distribution , as we have just shown .",
    "the sg distribution can also be studied from the point of view of von neumann s entropy @xmath185 we know that this quantity is always positive and well defined for any density matrix we evaluate it on .",
    "we can also plot ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : vn3 ] ) the von neumann entropies for @xmath151 , @xmath154 and @xmath165 and verify that they are not equally spaced as in the canonical distribution ( figure [ fig : canonical ] ) , where the thermodynamic and the von neumann entropy functions coincide .",
    "( dotted line ) , @xmath154 ( thin line ) and @xmath165 ( thick line ) , vs.  @xmath162 , with @xmath186 and @xmath169 .",
    "we can notice that the three levels are not equally spaced , width=566 ]    thus , as a consequence of the non - factorizability of the partition function , the von neumann entropy is not additive , even if the subsystems are non - interacting .",
    "obviously , by comparing figure  [ fig : vn3 ] and figure  [ fig5 ] we can easily verify that , in the sg case , von neumann entropy is not the same function as @xmath88 while in the canonical distribution both entropies coincide .",
    "we can explain this non - additivity of von neumann s entropy in a simple manner if we appeal to the notion of entanglement .",
    "if we compute the partial trace of the density matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq:19 ] ) , we obtain a density matrix @xmath187 , which we can write as @xmath188 analogously , we can define ( and compute ) @xmath189    however we can immediately verify that @xmath190    this is just reflecting upon the fact that sg density matrices , @xmath191 , represent entangled states , as we advanced in sec .",
    "[ sec : orig - non - extens ] .",
    "indeed , being defined from partition functions @xmath76 which are not factorizable , the description in terms of density matrices @xmath41 must also encode this property , and it does so in the standard way .",
    "we also know that , while separable states have additive von neumann entropy ( see appendix [ sec : addit - von - neum ] for a simple proof ) , the von neumann entropy of entangled states is never additive ( the difference between the entropy of the composite system with respect to the sum of the entropies of the subsystems is what is called the _ quantum mutual information _ in quantum information theory ) .",
    "in this paper we have proved that the schrdinger - gibbs density distribution , defined as the exponential of ( minus @xmath84 times ) the expected value of the hamiltonian operator on the corresponding ray , can not be used to construct a consistent quantum thermodynamics .",
    "it has severe problems at the thermodynamical level ( the third law of thermodynamics is not satisfied , see for instance figure [ fig : cv ] ) , and we have devoted some time to show that , in particular , the thermodynamic functions defined by it are non - extensive .",
    "notice that the definition of the ensemble ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:46 ] ) ) makes perfect sense for finite dimensional quantum systems , where the integral over the projective space is well defined .",
    "the framework we used in appendix [ sec : partition - function ] to perform the integrals for the partition function and to determine from there the expression of @xmath43 ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:85 ] ) ) depends also on the finiteness of the corresponding hilbert space .",
    "a natural question arises : can we extend our conclusions to general quantum systems , defined on infinite dimensional spaces ?",
    "the answer is not simple since the definition itself becomes quite subtle in infinite dimensions , because the rigorous mathematical definition of a functional integral over an infinite dimensional projective space is not an easy task .",
    "however let us assume that the definition of the functional integral is done and let us focus on the generalization of the results .",
    "there are two important points to discuss : the procedure we used in appendix [ sec : partition - function ] and the results we obtain .",
    "obviously the procedure makes sense only if the definition of the integral is done via a limit process over finite dimensional approximations . in this case",
    "we could define an analog of our integrals ( eq .",
    "( [ eq:32]-  ( [ eq:76 ] ) ) for each finite dimensional approximation without any change . regarding the results",
    ", the limit process would be straightforward as long as the spectrum of the hamiltonian operator is purely discrete , i.e. , if its essential spectrum is empty ( see @xcite ) . in that case , the dimension of all the eigenspaces is finite and there are no accumulation points in the spectrum . in a situation like this ,",
    "( [ eq:76b ] ) and e. ( [ eq:85 ] ) make sense even in infinite dimensions .",
    "we conclude thus that the sg ensemble does not make sense as an equilibrium distribution because the thermodynamics associated with it fails to satisfy very basic properties such as additivity or the third law . on the other hand ,",
    "the use of density distributions is a natural option when studying hybrid quantum - classical models such as ehrenfest models in nonadiabatic molecular dynamics ( see @xcite and @xcite).we leave for future work the study of the consequences of the analysis in this paper for the equilibrium and non - equilibrium statistics of hybrid quantum - classical systems ( see @xcite for a recent approach to nonequilibrium and irreversibility ) , where the nonlinear effects on the dynamics produced by the classical subsystem may alter significantly the results we have presented here .",
    "we will include , for completeness , a classical proof of the additivity of von neumann s entropy ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath192 be a composite system with hilbert space @xmath193 , of dimension @xmath194 .",
    "we want to prove that the von neumann entropy is additive on product states @xmath195 , i.e. , @xmath196 where @xmath197 .",
    "additivity comes from the fact that the spectrum of @xmath198 consists of the products of the eigenvalues of @xmath199 and @xmath200 : @xmath201 where we denote as @xmath202 and @xmath203 and @xmath204 respectively , and as @xmath205 and @xmath206 the corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "if we compute von neumann s entropy in the eigenbasis of @xmath207 we obtain @xmath208 where the fact that @xmath209 has been used .",
    "as the trace does not depend on the basis , the result is proved .",
    "for the sake of completeness , we prove in this appendix the following result : consider a function @xmath210 defined on the sphere @xmath211 , which is constant along the fibers of the fibration @xmath212 i.e. , which can be obtained as the pullback @xmath213 of a function @xmath210 on the projective space , or , from the physical point of view , which represents a true physical quantity , as it does not depend on the global phase of the state . notice that eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) corresponds to the restriction of the canonical fibration @xmath214 to the states of norm equal to one .",
    "then , we have that @xmath215 where @xmath216 and @xmath217 represent the corresponding volume forms .",
    "let us recall that both the sphere and the projective space are nontrivial differentiable manifolds and therefore that integrals on them are obtained by patching together the integrals on the charts of their atlases .",
    "thus , given an open covering @xmath218 for the manifold @xmath219 , we consider a subordinated partition of unity @xmath220 , i.e. , a collection of functions @xmath221 that satisfy that for any point @xmath222 , the sum of the functions corresponding to the open sets to which the point belong , is equal to one : @xmath223 with these , we define the integral on the manifold @xmath219 as @xmath224 where @xmath14 represents a function on @xmath219 , @xmath16 represents the corresponding volume element , and @xmath225 and @xmath226 represent the restrictions of the volume element and the function , respectively , to the open set @xmath227 .",
    "we can now use the bundle structure @xmath228 to define a covering for @xmath229 as a product : @xmath230 where @xmath231 represent open sets of a covering for @xmath232 and @xmath233 represent open sets of a covering of the projective space .",
    "such a covering always exists because of the bundle structure .",
    "then , consider a partition of unity @xmath220 for @xmath234 associated with the covering defined by the open sets @xmath235 .",
    "we can extend this family to define a covering for @xmath229 by considering a partition of the unity @xmath236 associated with the covering @xmath237 for the group @xmath238 , and defining @xmath239 it is trivial to verify that @xmath240 defines a partition of the unity related to the covering @xmath241 .",
    "next , we can define the integral on the sphere as : @xmath242 and , as the integrand is constant on the fibers , we can split the integral in the following way : @xmath243 by definition the integral on @xmath244 is equal to @xmath245 and thus we proved that eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) holds .",
    "our goal in this appendix is to compute the partition function @xmath246 where we recall that the relation of the integral on the unit sphere and the integral on the projective space ( which is the physically meaningful one ) is explained in appendix [ sec : integr - proj - space ] .",
    "consider this distribution written as in eq .",
    "( [ eq:46 ] ) and implement the constraint by a complex integral in the form @xmath247 where @xmath248 is the canonical volume element in @xmath40 .",
    "now , the gaussian integrals factorize and can be computed straightforwardly : @xmath249 if we also take into account the degeneracies of the eigenvalues we have : @xmath250 where @xmath69 represents the degeneracy of eigenvalue @xmath70 and the product runs only over different eigenvalues ( we assume that there are @xmath62 of them ) .",
    "the last integral ( over @xmath251 ) must be evaluated on the complex plane , where the integration runs over the real axis . to this end , let us first make a change of coordinates @xmath252 that produces : @xmath253 where now @xmath254 is the imaginary axis .        from the cauchy theorem , we know that the integral is equal to the sum of the corresponding residues at the poles of the integrand , which in this case lie on @xmath256 their order corresponding to the degeneracy of the corresponding eigenvalue .",
    "we have thus that : @xmath257        we would like to thank professor mario flora for several enlightening discussions that guided us in the right direction .",
