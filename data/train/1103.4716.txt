    "one would be afraid about that thermal effects on the effective potential may prevent the state from staying in the vicinity of the meta - stable vacuum during the cooling process and the system may escape to the runaway vacuum through the @xmath19-directions . in this section",

    "it is not easy to make a thorough investigation how the structure of the effective potential , which depends not only on @xmath14 but also @xmath37 , is affected by the change of temperature . instead , according to @xcite , we choose a particular path which passes from the meta - stable vacuum to a runaway direction , and",

    ", even a massless field contributes to the effective potential .",
    "this contribution is the constant given by @xmath84 .     +    since @xmath14 is no longer ( pseudo ) modulus at states with nonzero vevs for @xmath37 , the mass matrices ( [ eq : mb ] ) and ( [ eq : mf ] ) are not available to derive the effective potential .",
    "the comprehensive mass matrices @xmath85 and @xmath86 are given in appendix [ apx : mass matrix ] .",

    "one can show that ( [ eq : surfaceeqs ] ) are equivalent to ( [ eq : runaway1 ] ) and ( [ eq : runaway2 ] ) by replacing @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "in fact the tree level potential on the surface ( [ eq : surfaceeqs ] ) is written as @xmath90 taking a limit of @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 at the same time , @xmath94 goes to a supersymmetric global vacuum .    the qualitative behavior of the effective potential in fig .",
    "[ fig : low temp runaway ] is confirmed by an analytic calculation without any specification of parameters . at high temperature , the expansion ( [ high - temp ] )",

    "the effective potential on the surface ( [ eq : second part of path ] ) becomes @xmath95 where the coleman - weinberg potential is absent as mentioned before .",
    "one can see that @xmath96 increases as @xmath97 for @xmath98 , and thus the potential is always minimized at @xmath99 on the second part of the path .",
    "this suggests that , at high temperature , the stable state exists at least in the region @xmath100 .",
    "we summarize the evolution of the vacuum structure on the path for the choice of parameters , @xmath101 which is considered throughout this paper .",
    "these parameters allow a vacuum with @xmath0 symmetry breaking at zero temperature . at high temperature supersymmetry breaking",
    "vacuum sits at the origin of the field space @xmath102 where @xmath0 symmetry is not broken .",
    "as temperature decreases , potential barrier between the origin and the @xmath76-direction develops and a local vacuum appears along @xmath76-direction ( fig . [",
    "fig : low temp runaway ] ) , which has a higher potential value than one at the origin .",
    "so the origin remains to be favored as a vacuum .",
    "there is a local vacuum along @xmath76-direction at certain temperatures @xmath103 which is separated from the meta - stable vacuum by the tachyonic line as we have mentioned .",
    "meanwhile , the supersymmetric runaway vacuum develops along @xmath78 direction around @xmath104 .",
    "although the runaway vacuum may be energetically favoured compared to the meta - stable vacuum , the local minimum at the origin remains a vacuum state due to the large potential barrier between the origin and the runaway vacuum .",
    "simultaneously , the local vacuum at the origin of @xmath19 directions ( @xmath77 ) starts to roll down to a local vacuum near the origin along the @xmath14-direction where the @xmath0 symmetry is broken .",
    "the large potential barrier between @xmath14-direction and the @xmath19 directions prevents the @xmath0 breaking vacuum from decaying to the runaway vacuum and keeps it sitting on the meta - stable vacuum .",
    "we have studied finite temperature effects on oraifeartaigh type models with @xmath32 global symmetry where supersymmetry is spontaneously broken . at zero temperature",
    "the model has a meta - stable vacuum where @xmath0 symmetry is dynamically broken by the one - loop corrections for appropriate parameter regions .",
    "in addition to a meta - stable vacuum there also exists a runaway vacuum .",
    "we have investigated the finite temperature effects in the effective potential of the pseudo modulus field @xmath14 . in order to consider the finite temperature effects along the runaway direction , we chose a particular path so that tachyonic modes can be avoided .",
    "the main features of our study are summarized as follows :    * even though we have taken @xmath48 to study the effective potential , the finite temperature effects for the superpotential that allows the global symmetry @xmath32 is non - trivial .",
    "the phase structure during the cooling process is highly dependent on the parameter matrices @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "these matrices can not be chosen freely once one imposes the global symmetries . as we have mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the global symmetry is a key point when one considers the mediation of supersymmetry breaking . *",
    "our study reveals the effect of the intermediate and low - temperature region particularly .",
    "many of the preceding analyses do not pay much attention to that region , however , when one considers the cooling of the universe , it requires rigorous information in the intermediate and low - temperature region as well as high - temperature . as anticipated from the analytic calculations , the @xmath0 symmetry is recovered at high temperature which is the similar result found in the oraifeartaigh model without global symmetries @xcite .",
    "however , we find non - trivial vacuum structures - the landscape - at low temperatures .",
    "certain parameter regions that do not have the meta - stable vacua at zero temperature can posses @xmath0 breaking meta - stable vacuum at finite ( low ) temperature .",
    "this structure is not seen in the oraifeartaigh model without global symmetries @xcite .",
    "we obtained this result by performing the full numerical analysis without any ( high and low temperature ) approximations . * to obtain the correct value of the effective potential in runaway direction , we introduce inherently - tachyon - free path where the bosonic mass matrix coincides with the fermionic one . another possible way of the path that is used in @xcite is a smooth connection between the meta - stable and a runaway vacuum at zero temperature with weighting function . that kind of path is not appropriate for our case as pointed out in section 4 , since in the practical calculation it makes tachyonic modes on the path and causes a meaningless analyses .",
    "the choice of the path is critical .",
    "we would like to make some comments about a previous study . in the literature @xcite , thermal effective potential of a class of oraifeartaigh model which includes the model of the present paper has been analyzed .",
    "the author concludes that within certain high - temperature region a new meta - stable vacuum that is absent at zero temperature is developed far away from the origin @xmath107 . this kind of vacuum is not considered in section 4 .",
    "the main reason for this is the difference of focusing point and analysis . in @xcite , the massive scalar fields @xmath19 are integrated out to analyze the runaway behaviour @xmath92 , before introducing thermal effects .",
    "then the thermal potential is given in analytic form by using high - temperature expansion formula .",
    "meanwhile we keep all the fields explicitly , make the complete mass matrices , calculate eigenvalues of the mass matrices , and focus on the effective potential along the fixed path , particularly not far from the origin of @xmath19 and @xmath14 , by using numerical calculation .",
    "we close this work by pointing out future directions . here",
    "we studied the hidden sector that the @xmath0 symmetry breaking is spontaneously broken by the one - loop corrections in @xmath108 supersymmetric theory .",
    "however , in some @xmath108 supersymmetric model , especially accompanying strong gauge dynamics , the perturbative treatment is not available for all regions of the pseudo flat direction .",
    "for instance , in the izawa - yanagida - intriligator - thomas model @xcite where an oraifeartaigh type sector is dynamically generated by strong gauge dynamics in the low energy superpotential , in order to remove degeneracy of pseudo moduli , we have to take account of quantum corrections for the khler potential . in general , this is a very difficult task since the khler potential is not holomorphic and thus quantum corrections can be estimated at best by perturbative means only in the ultraviolet ( weak coupling ) region of the moduli space parameterizing the pseudo flat direction which is far from the origin .",
    "therefore , the potential behavior in the infrared region remains unclear .",
    "however , in an @xmath109 supersymmetric gauge theory one can derive the exact low energy effective action as was demonstrated by seiberg and witten @xcite , using the properties of holomorphy and duality . in the framework of @xmath109 supersymmetric gauge theory , some supersymmetry breaking models with @xmath0 symmetry breaking",

    "then , we have @xmath144 here @xmath145 is the polylogarism function and we have used the fact that the dominant contribution comes from @xmath146 sector in the expansions ( [ besselk_boson ] ) and ( [ besselk_fermion ] ) . again , using the asymptotic behavior @xmath147 , we find the low - temperature expansion of the thermal functions @xmath148 as we have discussed , at the origin of @xmath13 , the mass for @xmath13 is given by @xmath149 .",
    "therefore we expect that the finite temperature part of the effective potential at low temperature behaves like @xmath150 this expression would be useful for a calculable model to see the thermal evolution of vacuum analytically at low temperature . in our case , since analytic forms of eigenvalues are complicated , it is difficult to see the evolution analytically .",
    "however , the low temperature expansion is still useful for numerical calculations .",
    "it needs shorter time to evaluate the effective potential compare to the full thermal functions , .",
    "one can use the low temperature expansion to check the full result in the numerical analysis in section 3 .",
    "the general mass matrices are given as follows .",
