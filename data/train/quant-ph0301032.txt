    "recent results indicating that quantum information processing ( qip ) is inherently more powerful than its classical counterpart @xcite have motivated a resurgence of interest in the problem of decoherence @xcite .",
    "decoherence is a consequence of the inevitable coupling of any quantum system to its environment ( or bath ) , causing information loss from the system to this environment .",
    "it was recognized early on that decoherence poses a serious obstacle to physical realization of quantum information processors @xcite . here",
    "we define decoherence as _ non - unitary dynamics that is a consequence of system - environment coupling_. this includes ( but is not limited to ) both dissipative and dephasing contributions , traditionally known as @xmath0 and @xmath1 processes , respectively .",
    "dissipation refers to processes in which the populations of the quantum states are modified by interactions with the environment , while dephasing refers to processes that randomize the relative phases of the quantum states .",
    "both are caused by entanglement of the system with environmental degrees of freedom , leading to non - unitary system dynamics @xcite .",
    "for qip and other forms of quantum control , any such interaction that degrades the unitary nature of the quantum evolution is undesirable , since it causes loss of coherence of the quantum states and hence an inevitable decay of their interference and entanglement .",
    "interference is crucial for coherent control schemes @xcite , while entanglement is believed to be as important an ingredient of the quantum computational speed - up @xcite .",
    "in fact , a sufficiently decohered quantum computer can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer @xcite . in this review",
    "we provide a detailed introduction to the theory of decoherence - free subspaces and subsystems ( dfss ) , which have been conceived as one of the possible solutions to decoherence in qip .",
    "space limitations prevent us from discussing in detail the interesting problem of performing _ computation _ using dfss .",
    "instead we focus here on the use of dfss as a way to _ preserve _ delicate quantum information .",
    "environment - induced decoherence is a very extensively studied phenomenon in the quantum theory of measurement , and of the transition from quantum to classical behavior .",
    "zurek has shown that environmental superselection results in the establishment of certain special states that show redundancies in their correlations with the environment , and that may consequently be essentially unperturbed by this @xcite .",
    "these states , referred to as `` pointer states '' , are defined by a `` predictability sieve '' @xcite . while analysis of measurements are complicated by the presence of a measurement apparatus in addition to the system and environment ,",
    "the notion of a special set of states that are defined by some underlying symmetry in the global physical description is a common element .",
    "another noteworthy early study employing symmetries in order to reduce the coupling of subsets of system states to the environment is alicki s work on limited thermalization @xcite .",
    "identifying the power of such symmetries in the physical hamiltonian , and systematizing the way to find such symmetries has been one of the major innovative features of the recent development of dfs theory and its applications for quantum computation .",
    "early discussions of the effects of decoherence on quantum computation focused on putting conditions on the strength of coupling of the system - environment coupling and on the duration of quantum gates @xcite .",
    "the search for systematic ways to bypass decoherence in the context of qip , based on identification of states that might be immune to certain decohering interactions , started with observations of palma , suominen , and ekert @xcite in a study of the effects of pure _ dephasing _ , that two qubits possessing identical interactions with the environment do not decohere .",
    "et al_. used the term `` subdecoherence ''  to describe this phenomenon , suggested using the corresponding states to form a noiseless ",
    "encoding into logical qubits , and noted that the set of states robust against dephasing will depend on the specific form of qubit - environment coupling .",
    "this model was subsequently studied using a different method by duan and guo @xcite , with similar conclusions and a change of terminology to `` coherence preserving states '' .",
    "the idea of pairing qubits as a means for preserving coherence was further generalized by duan and guo in @xcite , where it was shown that both collective dephasing and dissipation could be prevented .",
    "however this assumed knowledge of the system - environment coupling strength .",
    "these early studies were subsequently cast into a general mathematical framework for dfss of more general system / environment interactions by zanardi and rasetti , first for the spin - boson model in @xcite , where the important `` collective decoherence '' model was introduced ( where several qubits couple identically to the same environment , while undergoing both dephasing and dissipation ) , then for general hamiltonians @xcite .",
    "their elegant algebraic analysis established the importance of identifying the dynamical symmetries in the system - environment interaction , and provided the first general formal condition for decoherence - free ( df ) states , that did not require knowledge of the system - environment coupling strength . in the work of zanardi and",
    "rasetti these are referred to as `` error avoiding codes '' .",
    "several papers focusing on collective dissipation appeared subsequently @xcite , as well as applications to encoding information in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "zanardi @xcite and independently lidar , chuang , and whaley @xcite showed that df states could also be derived from very general considerations of markovian master equations .",
    "et al_. introduced the term `` decoherence - free subspace '' , analyzed their robustness against perturbations , and pointed out that the absence of decoherence for df states can be spoiled by evolution under the system hamiltonian , identifying a second major requirement for viable use of the df states for either quantum memory or quantum computation @xcite .",
    "a completely general condition for the existence of df states was subsequently provided in terms of the kraus operator sum representation ( osr ) by lidar , bacon and whaley @xcite .",
    "all these studies share essentially the same canonical example of system - environment symmetry : a qubit - permutation symmetry in the system - environment coupling , that gives rise to collective dephasing , dissipation , or decoherence .",
    "the other main example of a symmetry giving rise to large dfss was provided by lidar _",
    "_ in @xcite .",
    "this is a much weaker form of spatial symmetry than permutation - invariance , termed `` multiple - qubit errors '' , which we describe in detail in section [ mqe ] .",
    "several papers reported various generalizations of dfss , e.g. , by extending dfss to quantum groups @xcite , using the rigged hilbert space formalism @xcite , and deriving dfss from a scattering s - matrix approach @xcite .",
    "however , the next major step forward in generalizing the dfs concept was taken by knill , laflamme , and viola @xcite , who introduced the notion of a `` noiseless subsystem '' . whereas previous dfs work had characterized df states as singlets ( one dimensional irreducible representations ) of the algebra generating the dynamical symmetry in the system - bath interaction , the work by knill _ et al_. showed that higher dimensional irreducible representations can support df states as well .",
    "an important consequence was the reduction of the number of qubits needed to construct a dfs under collective decoherence from four to three .",
    "this was noted independently by de filippo @xcite and by yang and gea - banacloche @xcite .",
    "the generalization from subspaces to subsystems has provided a powerful and elegant tool on which the full theory of universal , fault tolerant quantum computation on df states has now been established @xcite .",
    "it has also provided a basis for unifying essentially all known decoherence - suppression / avoidance strategies @xcite . in the remainder of this chapter",
    "we shall follow our usual convention to refer to both subsystems and subspaces interchangeably with the acronym dfs , the distinction being made explicit when necessary .",
    "following the initial studies establishing the _ conditions _ for dfss , bacon , lidar , and whaley made a thorough investigation of the robustness of df states to symmetry breaking perturbations @xcite .",
    "these authors also showed that the passive error correction ( `` error avoidance '' ) properties of a dfs can be combined with the active error correction protocols provided by quantum error correction by concatenation of a dfs inside a quantum error correcting code ( qecc ) @xcite , resulting in an encoding capable of protecting against both collective and independent errors @xcite .",
    "a combined dfs - qecc method was shown to be necessary in order to be enable universal , fault tolerant quantum computation in the multiple - qubit errors model @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the dfs for collective decoherence offers a natural energy barrier against other decoherence processes , a phenomenon termed `` supercoherence '' by bacon , brown and whaley @xcite .",
    "several more recent studies , by alber _",
    "et al . _ and khodjasteh and lidar ,",
    "have considered other hybrid dfs - qecc schemes , focusing in particular on protection against spontaneous emission @xcite .",
    "dfss have also been combined with the quantum zeno effect by beige _",
    "most recently , a combination of dfss and the method of dynamical decoupling @xcite was shown to offer a complete alternative to qecc @xcite .",
    "these explicit theoretical demonstrations that , firstly , df states exist and can provide stable quantum memory , and second , that fault tolerant universal computation can be performed on states encoded into a dfs , while initially superficially surprising to many , have generated several experimental searches for verification of dfss .",
    "the first experimental verification came with a demonstration by kwiat _",
    "of a 2-qubit dfs protecting photon states against collective dephasing @xcite .",
    "the same 2-qubit dfs was subsequently constructed and verified to reduce decoherence in ion trap experiments by kielpinski _",
    "_ @xcite . in the latter experiment an atomic state of one ion",
    "was combined with that of a spectator ion to form a 2-ion df state that was shown to be protected against dephasing deriving from long wavelength ambient magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "this experiment is significant in showing the potential of dfs states to protect fragile quantum state information against decoherence operative in current experimental schemes .",
    "more recently , universal control on the same 2-qubit dfs for collective dephasing has been demonstrated in the context of liquid state nuclear magnetic resonance by fortunato _",
    "nuclear magnetic resonance has also led to the first experimental demonstration , by viola _",
    "_ , of a 3-qubit df subsystem , providing immunity against full collective decoherence deriving from a combination of collective spin flips and collective dephasing @xcite . with these first experimental demonstrations , further experimental efforts towards implementation of dfss in active quantum computation , or merely as quantum memory encodings to transport single qubits from one position to another without incurring dephasing ,",
    "seems assured .",
    "for example , the use of a dfs has been identified as a major component in the construction of a scalable trapped ion quantum computer @xcite .",
    "a common criticism of the theory of dfss has been that the conditions required for a dfs to exist are very stringent and the assumptions underlying the theory may be too unrealistic .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the dfs concept was never meant to provide a full and independent solution to all decoherence problems . instead",
    ", the central idea has been _ to make use of the dynamical symmetries in the system - environment interaction first _ ( if they exist ) , and then to consider the next level of protection against decoherence .",
    "the robustness properties of dfss ensure that this is a reasonable approach .",
    "in addition , while the experimental evidence to date @xcite , is a reason for cautious optimism , there have also been a number of theoretical studies showing that the conditions for dfss may be _ created _ via the use of the dynamical decoupling method , by symmetrizing the system - bath interaction @xcite .",
    "this holds true for a wide range of system - bath interaction hamiltonians .",
    "it seems quite plausible that such active `` environment engineering '' methods will be necessary for dfss to become truly comprehensive tools in the quest to protect fragile quantum information .    in the remainder of this review",
    "we will now leave the historical perspective and provide instead a summary of the theory of df subspaces and their generalizations , df subsystems .",
    "we shall start , in section [ simple ] with a simple example of dfss in physical systems that is then used as a basis for a rigorous analysis of decoherence and the conditions for lack of this in an open quantum system ( section [ dec ] ) .",
    "we then provide , in section [ dfs - cond ] , a series of complementary characterizations of what a dfs is , using both exact and approximate formulations of open systems dynamics .",
    "a number of examples of dfss in different physical systems follow in section [ examples ] , some of them new .",
    "the later sections of the review deal with the generalization to df subsystems ( section [ subsystems ] ) , and the robustness of dfss ( section [ robustness ] ) . we conclude in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "let us begin by analyzing in detail the operation of the simplest dfs .",
    "this example , first analyzed by palma _",
    "_ in @xcite and generalized by duan &  guo @xcite , will serve to illustrate what is meant by a dfs .",
    "suppose that a system of @xmath2 qubits ( two - level systems ) is coupled to a bath in a symmetric way , and undergoes a dephasing process .",
    "namely , qubit @xmath3 undergoes the transformation @xmath4 which puts a random phase @xmath5 between the basis states @xmath6 with respective eigenvalues @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) .",
    "this can also be described by the matrix @xmath9 acting on the @xmath10 basis .",
    "we assume that the phase has no space ( @xmath3 ) dependence , i.e. , the dephasing process is invariant under qubit permutations .",
    "this symmetry is an example of the more general situation known as `` collective decoherence '' .",
    "since the errors can be expressed in terms of the single pauli spin matrix @xmath11 of the two - level system , we refer to this example as weak collective decoherence  . the more general situation when errors involving all three pauli matrices are present , i.e. , dissipation and dephasing ,",
    "is referred to as `` strong collective decoherence '' . without encoding a qubit initially in an arbitrary pure state",
    "@xmath12 will decohere .",
    "this can be seen by calculating its density matrix as an average over all possible values of @xmath5 , @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a probability density , and we assume the initial state of all qubits to be a product state . for a gaussian distribution , @xmath15 , it is simple to check that @xmath16 the decay of the off - diagonal elements in the computational basis is a signature of decoherence .",
    "let us now consider what happens in the two - qubit hilbert space .",
    "the four basis states undergo the transformation @xmath17 observe that the basis states @xmath18 and @xmath19 evolves under the dephasing process as @xmath20 and the overall phase thus acquired is clearly unimportant .",
    "this means that the 2-dimensional subspace @xmath21 of the 4-dimensional hilbert space of two qubits is _ decoherence - free_. the subspaces @xmath22 and @xmath23 are also ( trivially ) df , since they each acquire a global phase as well , @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively . since the phases acquired by the different subspaces differ , there is decoherence _ between _ the subspaces .    for @xmath26 qubits",
    "a similar calculation reveals that the subspaces @xmath27 and @xmath28 are df , as well the ( trivial )  subspaces @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "more generally , let @xmath31 in a computational basis state ( i.e. , a bitstring ) over @xmath2 qubits .",
    "then it is easy to check that any subspace spanned by states with constant @xmath32 is df , and can be denoted @xmath33 in accordance with the notation above .",
    "the dimensions of these subspaces are given by the binomial coefficients : @xmath34={k \\choose \\lambda _ { k}}$ ] and they each encode @xmath35 qubits .",
    "the encoding for the `` collective phase damping ''  model discussed here has been tested experimentally .",
    "the first - ever experimental implementation of dfss used the @xmath36 subspace to protect against artifially induced decoherence in a linear optics setting @xcite .",
    "the same encoding was subsequently used to alleviate the problem of external fluctuating magnetic fields in an ion trap quantum computing experiment @xcite , and figures prominently in theoretical constructions of encoded , universal quantum computation @xcite .",
    "let us now present a more formal treatment of decoherence . consider a closed quantum system , composed of a system @xmath37 of interest defined on a hilbert space @xmath38 ( e.g. , a quantum computer ) and a bath @xmath39 .",
    "the full hamiltonian is @xmath40 where @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 are , respectively , the system , bath and system - bath interaction hamiltonians , and @xmath44 is the identity operator .",
    "the evolution of the closed system is given by @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the combined system - bath density matrix and the unitary evolution operator is @xmath47 ( we set @xmath48 ) . assuming initial decoupling between system and bath , the evolution of the closed system is given by : @xmath49\\mathbf{u}^{\\dagger } ( t)$ ] . without loss of generality the interaction hamiltonian can be written as @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are , respectively , system and bath operators .",
    "it is this coupling between system and bath that causes decoherence in the system , through entanglement with the bath . to see this more",
    "clearly it is useful to arrive at a description of the system alone by averaging out the uncontrollable bath degrees of freedom , a procedure formally implemented by performing a partial trace over the bath : @xmath53.\\ ] ] the reduced density matrix @xmath54 now describes the system alone . by diagonalizing the initial bath density matrix , @xmath55 , and evaluating the partial trace in the same basis",
    "one finds : @xmath56 where the `` _ _ kraus operators _ _ ''  are given by :    @xmath57    the expression ( [ eq : osr ] ) is known as the operator sum representation ( osr ) and can be derived from an axiomatic approach to quantum mechanics , without reference to hamiltonians @xcite . since @xmath58",
    "the kraus operators satisfy the normalization constraint @xmath59 because of this constraint it follows that when the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : osr ] ) includes only one term the dynamics is unitary .",
    "_ thus a simple criterion for decoherence in the osr is the presence of multiple independent terms in the sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : osr ] ) . _    while the osr is a formally exact description of the dynamics of the system density matrix , its utility is somewhat limited because the explicit calculation of the kraus operators is equivalent to a full diagonalization of the high - dimensional hamiltonian @xmath60 .",
    "furthermore , the osr is in a sense too strict . this is because as a closed - system formulation it incorporates the possibility that information which is put into the bath will back - react on the system and cause a recurrence .",
    "such interactions will always occur in the closed - system formulation ( due to the the hamiltonian being hermitian ) .",
    "however , in many practical situations the likelihood of such an event is extremely small .",
    "thus , for example , an excited atom which is in a `` cold ''  bath will radiate a photon and decohere , but the bath will not in turn return the atom back to its excited state , except via the ( extremely long ) recurrence time of the emission process . in these situations a more appropriate way to describe the evolution of the system is via a quantum dynamical _ semigroup master equation _ @xcite . by assuming that ( i ) the evolution of the system density matrix is governed by a one - parameter semigroup ( markovian dynamics ) , ( ii ) the evolution is futher `` completely positive '' @xcite , and ( iii ) the system and bath density matrices are initially decoupled ,",
    "lindblad @xcite has shown that the most general evolution of the system density matrix @xmath61 is governed by the master equation @xmath62+\\mathtt{l}_{d}[\\mathbf{\\rho } ( t ) ]   \\nonumber \\\\",

    "the commutator involving @xmath68 is the ordinary , unitary , heisenberg term .",
    "all the non - unitary , decohering dynamics is accounted for by @xmath69 , and this is one of the advantages of the lindblad equation : unlike the osr , it clearly separates unitary from decohering dynamics . for a derivation of the lindblad equation from the osr , using a coarse graining procedure , including an explicit calculation of the coefficients @xmath70 and the lamb shift @xmath64 , see @xcite .",
    "note that the @xmath65 can often be identified with the @xmath51 of the interaction hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_i ] ) @xcite .",
    "with the above statement of the conditions for decoherence let us now show how to formally eliminate decoherence .",
    "it is convenient to do so by reference to the hamiltonian , osr , and semigroup formulations .",
    "this leads to a number of essentially equivalent formulations of the conditions for df dynamics , whose utility is determined by the approach one would like to employ to study a specific problem . in addition , it is useful to give formulations which make contact with the theory of quantum error correcting codes ( qecc ) . first , let us give a formal definition of a dfs :    a system with hilbert space @xmath71 is said to have a decoherence - free subspace @xmath72 if the evolution inside @xmath73 is purely unitary .",
    "note that because of the possibility of a bath - induced lamb shift [ @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mastereq ] ) ] this definition of a dfs does not entirely rule out adverse effects a bath may have on a system .",
    "also , we are not excluding unitary errors that may be the result of inaccurate implementation of quantum logic gates . both of these problems , which in practice are inseparable ,",
    "must be dealt with by other methods , such as concatenated codes @xcite .      as remarked above , in terms of the hamiltonian @xmath60 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , decoherence is the result of the entanglement between system and bath caused by the interaction term @xmath43 . in other words , if @xmath74 then system and bath are decoupled and evolve independently and unitarily under their respective hamiltonians @xmath75 and @xmath42 . clearly , then",
    ", a sufficient condition for _ decoherence free _ ( df ) dynamics is that @xmath76 .",
    "however , since one can not simply switch off the system - bath interaction , in order to satisfy this condition it is necessary to look for special subspaces of the full system hilbert space @xmath38 .",
    "as shown first by zanardi and rasetti @xcite , such a subspace is found by assuming that there exists a set @xmath77 of eigenvectors of the @xmath51 s with the property that :    @xmath78    note that these eigenvectors are _ degenerate _ , i.e. , the eigenvalue @xmath79 depends only on the index @xmath80 of the system operators , but not on the state index @xmath81 .",

    "( [ eq : a - block ] ) , it follows that eq .",
    "( [ eq : cond2 ] ) is satisfied with @xmath170 .",
    "note , however , that unlike the general qecc case which has a full - rank matrix @xmath171 , in the dfs case this matrix has rank 1 ( since the @xmath172 row equals row 1 upon multiplication by @xmath173 ) .",
    "a  qecc is said to be non - degenerate if it has full rank @xcite .",
    "a dfs , therefore , is a completely degenerate qecc @xcite .",
    "a related characterization of dfss is in terms of _ distance _ @xcite : a dfs is a qecc with infinite distance @xcite , meaning essentially that the errors it is stable against can have arbitrary strength .",
    "a dfs is an unusual qecc in another way : as we saw above , decoherence does not affect a perfect dfs _ at all_. since they are based on a perturbative treatment , other active qeccs ( e.g. , stabilizer codes @xcite ) are specifically constructed to improve the fidelity to a given order in the error rate , which therefore always allows for some residual decoherence to take place .",
    "the absence of decoherence to any order for a perfect dfs is due to the existence of symmetries in the system - bath coupling which allow for an _ exact _ treatment .",
    "these symmetries are ignored by perturbative qeccs either for the sake of generality , or because they simply do not exist , as in the case of independent couplings . given a dfs , the only errors that can take place involve undesired unitary rotations of codewords ( basis states @xmath77 of @xmath88 ) inside the dfs , due to imprecisions or a bath - induced lamb shift .",
    "thus , the complete characterization of dfss as a qecc is given by the following @xcite :    let @xmath174 be a qecc for error operators @xmath175 , with recovery operators @xmath176 .",
    "then @xmath174 is a dfs iff upon restriction to @xmath174 , @xmath177 for all @xmath178 .    _",
    "proof_. first suppose @xmath163 is a dfs . then by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : a - block ] ) and ( [ eq : ra - block ] ) , @xmath179 to satisfy this equation , it must be true that @xmath180 where @xmath181 and @xmath182 are arbitrary .",
    "multiplying , the condition @xmath183 implies @xmath184 by unitarity of @xmath185 .",

    "( [ eq : a - block ] ) , the theorem is proved .",
    "thus in the sense of reversal of quantum operations on a subspace , dfss are a particularly simple instance of general qeccs , where upon restriction to the code subspace , all recovery operators are proportional to the inverse of the system evolution operator .",
    "of course , underlying this simplicity is an important assumption of dynamical symmetry .",
    "a most useful tool in the theory of qecc is the _ stabilizer _ formalism @xcite .",
    "the stabilizer in qecc is an abelian subgroup @xmath194 of the pauli group ( the group formed by tensor products of pauli matrices on the qubits ) .",
    "it  allows identification of the errors the code can correct : the kraus - operators @xmath169 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : amunu ] ) can be expanded in a basis @xmath195 of `` errors '' .",
    "two types of errors can be dealt with by stabilizer codes : ( i ) errors @xmath196 that anticommute with some @xmath197 , and ( ii ) errors that are part of the stabilizer ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "the first class are errors that require active correction ; the second class ( ii ) are `` degenerate '' errors that do not affect the code at all . a duality between qeccs and dfss can be stated as follows : qeccs were designed primarily to deal with type ( i ) errors , but can also be regarded as dfss for the errors in their stabilizer @xcite .",
    "conversely , dfss were designed primarily to deal with type ( ii ) errors , but can in principle be used as a qecc against errors that are type ( i ) with respect to @xmath199 .",
    "a further use of the stabilizer is that it allows one to identify sets of fault - tolerant universal gates for quantum computation @xcite . to this end , and to make a more explicit connection to qeccs , it is useful to recast the dfs condition eq .",

    "this @xmath199 is therefore a generalization of the qecc stabilizers .",

    "secondly , the dfs conditions given in section [ dfs - cond ] are far more general than the dicke states .",
    "this will become even more apparent in our discussion on df subsystems , in section [ subsystems ] . within the formal analysis provided by the dfs conditions the dicke states appear naturally as those states that are isolated against any interactions with the radiation field .    to further emphasize the distinction between dicke states and dfs theory",
    ", we consider an interesting extension of these collective atomic states , that results when one incorporates the single field mode into the system , and distinguishes this from an external environment of other radiation modes .",

    "@xcite , within the markovian semigroup formulation .",
    "it was shown that if an additional set of lindblad operators are added to the lindblad equation ( [ eq : mastereq ] ) , parametrized by a coupling strength @xmath469 , then the `` mixed state fidelity '' @xmath470 $ ] , i.e. , the overlap between the ideal ( decoherence - free ) evolution @xmath471 and the perturbed evolution @xmath472 , decays as @xmath473 .",

    "@xcite , where a stability analysis was made within both the semigroup and osr formulations .",
    "it was shown that in both formulations states in dfss are stable to symmetry - breaking perturbations to second order in the strength of the perturbation : @xmath474 , so the entire @xmath475 contribution vanishes to all orders in time .",
    "this indicates that the dfss are well - suited for applications to quantum memory , a result that has been recently been taken advantage of in ion traps @xcite .",
    "errors that do occur can be dealt with by a number of methods : ( i ) additional encoding @xcite , ( ii ) implementing error - detection circuits @xcite ; ( iii ) hamiltonian engineering to suppress or eliminate further errors @xcite ; ( iv ) combination with the dynamical decoupling technique @xcite .",
    "we briefly summarize instances of these four approaches here .    in the collective decoherence dfs ,",
    "independent single qubit errors can be shown to cause either independent errors acting on the encoded qubit states , or leakage of the dfs encoded qubit states to states lying outside the dfs @xcite .",
    "both of these types of errors may be corrected by concatenating the dfs encoding with a standard quantum error - correcting code that corrects independent single qubit errors .",

    "@xcite to produce a 20-qubit encoding that provides protection against both collective and independent errors on the physical qubits .",
    "concatenation thus provides one way to correct leakage errors that take the encoded quantum information out of the dfs .",

    "such circuits may be readily incorporated into schemes for implementing fault - tolerant computation such as in refs .",
    "this particular leakage - correction circuit allows correction without any measurement , providing a simpler approach than usual in protocols for fault tolerance .",
    "the third approach to dealing with errors not specifically protected against by the dfs encoding , namely by hamiltonian engineering to eliminate additional errors , is very different from the first two .",
    "the idea here is to supplement the qubit hamiltonian by additional interactions that impose an energy spectrum on the dfs states .",
    "the additional hamiltonian terms are specifically engineered to result in an energy spectrum that eliminates or thermally suppresses additional errors .",
    "this approach has been demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite , using the four - qubit dfs encoding against collective decoherence .",
    "addition of a specifically designed set of exchange interactions between the physical qubits causes the qubit tensor product states in the dfs representation ( section  [ spin - boson ] ) to split into a spectrum of higher angular momentum states that are separated from the degenerate ground state that provides the zero angular momentum dfs encoding .",
    "the effect of this additional hamiltonian is to transform all independent single - qubit errors into non - energy conserving errors that cause excitation out of the ground state encoding .",
    "thus all local phase errors on the encoded qubit states have been removed , while maintaining their protection against collective decoherence , leading to their designation as `` coherence - preserving '' or `` supercoherent '' .",
    "the energy - nonconserving errors can be suppressed by going to low temperatures , or alternatively , used as an error - detecting code .",
    "the fourth approach to dealing with additional errors combines dfs encoding with the method of strong and fast dynamical decoupling pulses proposed by viola and lloyd in ref .",
    "the first concrete example of this approach was given by wu and lidar in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was shown that dynamical decoupling pulses can create the conditions for both the multiple - qubit and collective decoherence error models , starting from arbitrary system - bath interactions . in the latter error model , this can be done by rapidly pulsing the heisenberg exchange interaction , so the scheme is fully compatible with universal quantum computation on the resulting dfs .",
    "however , even after the creation of the appropriate symmetry , leakage from the dfs is still possible . to this end refs .",
    "@xcite showed explicitly how leakage errors too can be eliminated using dynamical decoupling , and in the case of collective decoherence , these can again be generated using heisenberg interactions .",
    "integration of all these components ( dfs protection , generation of symmetric system - bath interaction , and leakage elimination ) , has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .    these studies of effects of errors beyond the specific error models defining the dfs and",
    "its protection show that there are a number of viable approaches to incorporate dfs encodings into stronger schemes that provide protection of quantum states at multiple levels .",
    "they can be used both to further improve the performance of dfs encoded qubits for quantum memory applications , and also in implementations of quantum computation with dfs encodings @xcite .",
    "concatenation and leakage - detection circuits provide a direct route to the established framework of fault - tolerance .",
    "similarly , the use of hamiltonian engineering as a design tool to suppress or remove additional errors relates to the very different approach advocated by topological quantum computing , where one seeks to optimize the hamiltonian structure to eliminate or automatically correct errors @xcite .",
    "the dfs - dynamical decoupling combination ties in naturally with several solid state and atomic physics proposals for quantum computing .",
    "these relations deserve further exploration in the future .",
    "this review is an introduction to the now well - developed theory of decoherence - free subspaces and subsystems ( dfss ) .",
    "the central idea behind dfss is that decoherence can be avoided by encoding quantum information into special subspaces that are protected from the interaction with the environment by virtue of a dynamical symmetry .",
    "this idea has roots that can be traced to work in quantum optics , the measurement problem , and the general theory of open quantum systems",
    ". however , the appreciation of its importance to quantum information theory , the development of a rigorous underlying mathematical framework , and experimental verification , are all very recent .",
    "we have provided here a survey of these developments , emphasizing the theoretical contributions to the problem of _ preservation _ of quantum information , as opposed to the rich and fascinating subject of its _",
    "manipulation_. this was illustrated with examples from quantum optics and general models of interacting quantum systems .",
    "it is important to emphasize that dfss are only one of several ideas for the preservation of quantum information , and that full protection of quantum information is likely to involve a combination at different levels of several methods .",
    "the most notable alternatives are quantum error correcting codes , geometric and topological encodings of quantum information , and dynamical suppression of decoherence via the application of fast and strong pulses .",
    "it is now increasingly apparent that there are strong unifying features to all of these ideas , in the sense that there is an underlying algebraic structure from which all the different methods seem to emerge .",
    "future investigations will no doubt further clarify this unity , and it is our hope that new experiments will confirm the usefulness of the dfs concept , in particular for quantum information processing .",
    "this material is based on research sponsored by the defense advanced research projects agency under the quist program and managed by the air force research laboratory ( afosr ) , under agreements f49620 - 01 - 1 - 0468 and f30602 - 01 - 2 - 0524 .",
    "the authors effort was also supported by the national security agency ( nsa ) and the advanced research and development activity ( arda ) under army research office ( aro ) contracts daag55 - 98 - 1 - 0371 and daad19 - 00 - 1 - 0380 .",

    "the mathematical and physical relations between these two contributions to non - unitary evolution of the system have been the subject of many studies in quantum relaxation theory over the last 20 years . in the energy eigenbasis",
    "dephasing causes decay of off - diagonal elements of the density matrix , while dissipation causes decay of both diagonal and off - diagonal elements . in the context of quantum computation and error correction",
    "it has become customary to refer to both types of processes generically as ` decoherence ' .",
    "while the original meaning of decoherence was specifically designated to describe loss of coherences in the off - diagonal elements of the density operator in the energy eigenbasis , there are several reasons why one may wish to be less specific for general study of the effects of environmental interactions on quantum information processing .",
    "first , there is the undesirable fact that such decay of coherences in the off - diagonal elements of the density operator is basis set dependent .",
    "second , at the physical level , both dissipative and dephasing interactions contribute to this loss of coherence in off - diagonal elements .",
    "these two factors render it more preferable in the context of a general consideration of quantum errors to adopt the now common usage of ` decoherence ' to refer quite generally to loss of unitary evolution and to all underlying physical mechanisms for this ."
