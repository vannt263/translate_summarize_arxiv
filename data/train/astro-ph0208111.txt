    "hde  318016 was discovered to have an emission line spectrum of wolf - rayet type by @xcite .",
    "because both n and c emission lines appear strong in the spectrum it was classified as wc7-n6 by @xcite .",
    "this star was included in the sixth catalogue of galactic wolf - rayet stars @xcite as wr  98 and classified as wn7+wc7 .",
    "however wr  98 was confirmed to be a single - lined binary with a period of 47.8 days with n and c emission lines moving in phase @xcite .",
    "the optical spectrum of wr  98 has been described by @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed the nomeclature wn / wc for wr  98 suggesting that this star , along with others with similar emission line spectra where both n and c lines are observed , has a transition composition between the wn and wc subclasses .",
    "@xcite classified wr  98 as wn8o / c7 , using a new three - dimensional classification scheme , where the `` o '' means that no hydrogen is observed in the spectrum .",
    "relevant parameters of wr  98 can be found in the recent viith catalogue of galactic wr stars @xcite .    wr  98 is a probable member of the open cluster trumpler 27 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it has also been detected as a non - thermal radio source by @xcite .",
    "furthermore , wr  98 exhibits random relatively large amplitude optical light variations ( @xmath1 0.1 magnitude in the johnson v filter ) , typical of stars with wn8 type spectrum , but a periodicity for these variations has not been found @xcite .    in this work we present a detailed radial velocity analysis of optical spectral lines of wr  98 showing it to be a double - lined binary with high minimum masses .",
    "41 photographic spectrograms were obtained at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory , chile , between 1980 and 1984 .",
    "these spectrograms were secured with the image - tube spectrograph at the cassegrain focus of the 1-m yale telescope .",
    "all exposures were made on kodak iiia - j emulsion baked in `` forming gas '' ( @xmath2 ) .",

    "the blue optical spectrum of wr  98 is illustrated in fig  [ spect ] , with identifications for main spectral features .",

    "all of hei emission lines in our blue spectra show p - cygni profiles , as well as heii 5411 and niv 5203 ( see fig .",
    "[ spect ] ) .",
    "relative intensities of niii , heii , niv , and ciii lines in our spectra of wr  98 indicate a spectral type wn7 - 8/c .",
    "no hydrogen is detected in the spectrum .",
    "relative intensities of emission lines in the spectrum of wr  98 show no appreciable changes in the whole of our dataset spanning 20 years of observations .",
    "we have compared wn the spectrum of wr  98 with that of stars classified as wn7o and wn8o @xcite , namely and , for which we also have digital spectra observed with the same instrumental configuration as wr  98 .",
    "this comparison indicates that wr  98 has a higher ionization degree than the wn8o star , because niv emission lines in the spectrum of wr  98 are stronger and niii emission lines are weaker .",
    "actually , the wn spectrum of wr  98 mostly resembles that of wr  55 , classified as wn7 by @xcite .",
    "thus our blue optical spectra of wr  98 would be best described as wn7o / wc . fig .",
    "[ spect3 ] shows the spectra of wr123 , wr98 , and wr55 for comparison .",
    "several faint absorption lines were detected upon the wn emission lines in our spectra of wr  98 .",
    "these absorptions are h@xmath12 and h@xmath15 , hei @xmath8 4026 , 4471 , and 5015  and heii @xmath8 4200 , and 4540 .",
    "as will be shown below , these lines belong to an ob companion . because heii absorptions appear fainter than hei in the ob spectrum , we presume that the companion probably is of spectral type o8 - 9 . the luminosity class is not possible to determine from our data .",
    "previous results @xcite already have shown the variability of radial velocities of the emission lines in the spectrum of wr  98 .",
    "we searched for periodicities of the radial velocity variations in the strongest emission lines in our spectra , namely he @xmath17 4686 and ciii @xmath17 4648 using algorithms published by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the most probable period obtained by both codes is 47.8 days .",
    "using this period as initial value , we then calculated orbital solutions for the radial velocity variations of both emission lines .",
    "we found that the solutions tend to circular orbits , with the most probable value of the period as @xmath18 .",
    "however , other periods close to this value can not be discarded .",
    "orbital elements for each emission line and the h@xmath12 and h@xmath15 absorptions were determined with an improved version of the program originally published by @xcite . with the present data , the orbits of the four emission lines , niv , nv ,",
    "ciii , and heii have negligible eccentricity , thus we have fitted circular orbits for all our radial velocities .",
    "circular orbital elements for the individual lines are listed in table  [ elements ] , where @xmath19 refers to the center - of - mass velocity , @xmath20 , to the semi - amplitude of the radial velocity variations , and @xmath21 is the time when the wr star is in the front of the system .    in our orbital fits the three best defined emission lines gave equal @xmath21 values within errors ,",
    "therefore we adopt as ephemeris for the wr  98 binary system :    t@xmath22 = 2,445,676.4 + 47.825e    niv , nv , ciii , and heii emission lines move in phase , indicating that they are formed in the same stellar envelope .",
    "this is also the case in the two other known wn / c binaries , namely wr  145 ( mr  111 ) and wr  153 ( gp cep ) @xcite .",
    "no detectable phase delays among emission lines are present within the errors of the orbital fits .",
    "semi - amplitudes of the orbital motion of the heii and ciii emission lines appear lower than those of ionized nitrogen emission lines .",
    "this effect is also observed in other wr binaries , e.g. wr  29 @xcite , and may arise if the heii and ciii lines are partly formed in the interaction region of the binary components .",
    "we measured h@xmath12 and h@xmath15 absorptions in those spectra of wr  98 were this was possible .",
    "radial velocities of these hydrogen lines phased with the binary period move anti - phased with the emission lines , thus indicating that they belong to an o type companion of the wr component in the binary system .",
    "[ comp ] depicts the behaviour of the h@xmath15 absorption line upon the heii 4859  emission in four different binary phases , illustrating the antiphased movement of the absorption and emission lines .    the circular orbital elements for the hydrogen absorption lines are included in table  [ elements ] , and depicted in fig  [ f2 ] .    the orbital semi - amplitudes of the radial velocity variations of the absorption lines and of niv , nv , heii and ciii emission lines indicate mass - ratios ( @xmath23 ) between 1 and 1.8 .",
    "if a monotonic outward decreasing temperature gradient exists in the expanding wr envelope , we expect that the highest ionization emission , namely nv , represents better the orbital motion of the wn / c component , thus a value of @xmath24 seems more plausible",
    ". however , taking into account the rather high uncertainties in the radial velocity values of the absorption lines , these mass  ratios should not be overinterpreted .",
    "values of minimum masses and @xmath25 for both components are tabulated for each emission line in table  [ elements ] .",
    "we also estimated the radii of the critical roche lobes using the expression given by @xcite , which resulted @xmath26 for both components .",

    "the minimun masses indicated by our radial velocity orbit are quite high . adopting the radial velocity orbit of the nv emission as representative of the motion of the wr component of the binary , we obtain values of minimum masses of 28 and 27 @xmath39 for the wr and ob components , respectively .",
