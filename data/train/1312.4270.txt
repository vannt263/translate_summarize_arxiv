    "however , this was not the first bec because three years before the bec state was impressively obtained working with cold metastable alkali gases .",
    "@xcite the same year bec of h@xmath0  was obtained , safonov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite observed for the first time a quasi - condensate of nearly two - dimensional h@xmath0  adsorbed on the surface of superfluid @xmath1he .    in spite of hydrogen losing the race against alkali gases to be the first bec system",
    ", it still deserves interest for both theory and experiment .",
    "hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element of the universe and , when it is spin polarized with the use of a proper magnetic field , it is the only system that remains in the gas state down to the limit of zero temperature .",
    "h@xmath0  is therefore extremely quantum matter .",
    "a standard measure of the quantum nature of a system is the de boer parameter  @xcite @xmath2 with @xmath3 and @xmath4 the well depth and core radius of the pair interaction , respectively . according to this definition , @xmath5 for h@xmath0   which is the largest value for @xmath6 among all the quantum fluids ( for instance , @xmath7 for @xmath1he ) .",
    "this large value for @xmath6 results from the shallow minimum ( @xmath8 k ) of the triplet potential @xmath9  @xmath10 between spin - polarized hydrogen atoms and their small mass .",
    "@xcite    adsorption of h@xmath0  on the surface of liquid @xmath1he has been extensively used because of its optimal properties .",
    "@xcite on one hand , the interaction of any adsorbant with the @xmath1he surface is the smallest known , and on the other , at temperatures @xmath11 mk the @xmath1he vapor pressure is negligible and thereby above the free surface one can reasonably assume vacuum .",
    "in fact , liquid @xmath1he was also extensively used in the search of the three - dimensional h@xmath0  bec state when the cells were coated with helium films to avoid adsorption of h@xmath0  on the walls and the subsequent recombination to form molecular hydrogen h@xmath12 .",
    "@xcite helium is chemically inert and only a small fraction of @xmath13he ( @xmath14 % ) is soluble in bulk @xmath1he ; spin - polarized hydrogen , and its isotopes deuterium and tritium , are expelled to the surface where they have a single bound state .",
    "for instance , in the case of h@xmath0 , the chemical potential of a single atom in bulk @xmath1he is  @xcite @xmath15 k to be compared with the negative value on the surface , @xmath16 k.  @xcite    the quantum degeneracy of h@xmath0  adsorbed on @xmath1he is quantified by defining the quantum parameter @xmath17 , with @xmath4 the surface density and @xmath18 the thermal de broglie wave length .",
    "@xcite experiments try to increase this parameter as much as possible by increasing the surface density and lowering the temperature of the film . to this end ,",
    "two methods for local compression have been used .",
    "the first one , that relies on the application of a high magnetic field , is able to attain large quantum parameter values , @xmath19 .",
    "@xcite however , to measure the main properties of the quasi - two dimensional gas becomes difficult due to the large magnetic field .",
    "@xcite an alternative to this method is to work with thermal compression , in which a small spot on the sample cell is cooled down to a temperature below the one of the cell .",
    "@xcite this second method achieves lower values for quantum degeneracy @xmath20 but allows for direct observation of the sample . up to now , it has not been possible to arrive to the value @xmath21 where the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless superfluid transition is expected to set in .",
    "nevertheless , the quantum degeneracy of the gas has been observed as a decrease of the three - body recombination rate at temperatures @xmath22-@xmath23 mk and densities @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite    the zero - temperature equations of state of bulk gas  @xcite h@xmath0and liquid  @xcite t@xmath0 have been recently calculated using accurate quantum monte carlo methods .",
    "properties like the condensate fraction , distribution functions and localization of the gas(liquid)-solid phase transitions have been established with the help of the ab initio h@xmath0-h@xmath0  interatomic potential .",
    "@xcite from the theoretical side , much less is known about the ground - state properties of two - dimensional h@xmath0  or h@xmath0  adsorbed on a free @xmath1he surface . in a pioneering work , mantz and edwards",
    "@xcite used the variational feynman - lekner approximation to calculate the effective potential felt by a hydrogen atom on the @xmath1he surface . solving the schrdinger equation for the atom in this effective potential they concluded that h@xmath0 , d@xmath0 , and t@xmath0 have a single bound state and calculated the respective binding energies .",
    "the main drawback of this treatment is that the adsorbent is substituted by an effective field representing a static and undisturbed surface . in fact , a quantitatively accurate approach to this problem requires a good model for the @xmath1he surface .",
    "@xcite the use of accurate he - he potentials and ground - state quantum monte carlo methods has proved to be able to reproduce experimental data directly related to the surface , like the surface tension and the surface width .",
    "@xcite in the present work , we rely on a similar methodology to the one previously used in the study of the free @xmath1he surface  @xcite in order to microscopically characterize the ground - state of h@xmath0  adsorbed on its surface .",
    "our study is complemented by a purely two - dimensional simulation of h@xmath0  in order to establish the degree of two - dimensionality of the adsorbed film .",

    "the quantum monte carlo method used for this study is described in sec .",

    "iii together with the comparison with the strictly two - dimensional case .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "iv comprises a brief summary and the main conclusions of the work .",
    "we have studied the ground - state ( zero temperature ) properties of a thin layer of h@xmath0  adsorbed on the free surface of a @xmath1he slab and also the limiting case of a strictly two - dimensional ( 2d ) h@xmath0  gas .",
    "focusing first on the slab geometry , the hamiltonian of the system composed by @xmath26 @xmath1he and @xmath27 h@xmath0   atoms is @xmath28 with capital and normal indices standing for @xmath1he and h@xmath0  atoms , respectively .",
    "the pair potential between he atoms is the aziz hfd - b(he ) model  @xcite used extensively in microscopic studies of liquid and solid helium .",
    "the h@xmath0-h@xmath0  interaction ( @xmath29 triplet potential ) was calculated with high accuracy by kolos and wolniewicz ( kw ) .",
    "@xcite more recently , this potential has been recalculated up to larger interatomic distances by jamieson , dalgarno , and wolniewicz ( jdw ) .",
    "@xcite we have used the jdw data smoothly connected with the long - range behavior of the h@xmath0-h@xmath0  potential as calculated by yan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite the jdw potential has a core diameter of @xmath30  and a minimum @xmath31 k ( slightly deeper than kw ) at a distance @xmath32  .",
    "finally , we take the h - he pair potential from das _",
    "et al . _ ;  @xcite this model has been used in the past in the study of a single h@xmath0  impurity  @xcite in liquid @xmath1he and in mixed t@xmath0-@xmath1he clusters .",
    "@xcite the das potential  @xcite has a minimum @xmath33 k at a distance @xmath34  .",
    "the quantum @xmath35-body problem is solved stochastically using the diffusion monte carlo ( dmc ) method .",
    "@xcite dmc is nowadays one of the most accurate tools for the study of quantum fluids and gases , providing exact results for boson systems within some statistical errors . in brief",
    ", dmc solves the imaginary - time ( @xmath36 ) @xmath35-body schrdinger equation for the function @xmath37 , with @xmath38 the exact ground - state wave function .",
    "the auxiliary wave function @xmath39 acts as a guiding wave function in the diffusion process towards the ground state when @xmath40 .",
    "the direct statistical sampling with @xmath41 , called mixed estimator , is unbiased for the energy but not completely for operators which do not commute with the hamiltonian . in these cases , we rely on the use of pure estimators based on the forward walking strategy .  @xcite the influence of the finite time step used in the iterative process is reduced by working with a second - order expansion for the imaginary - time green s function .",
    "@xcite the last systematic error that one has to deal with is the finite number of walkers @xmath42 which represent the wave function @xmath43 . as usual , we analyze which is the number of walkers required to reduce any bias coming from it to the level of the statistical uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath1he surface is simulated using a slab which grows symmetrically in the @xmath44 direction and with periodic boundary conditions in the @xmath45 plane .",
    "@xcite the guiding wave function is then the product of two terms @xmath46 the first one accounting for dynamical correlations induced by the interatomic potentials and the second for the finite size of the liquid in the @xmath44 direction .",

    "any spurious kinetic energy contribution due to the movement of the center of mass of the full system ( @xmath1he+h@xmath0 ) is removed by subtracting @xmath62 from each particle coordinate @xmath44 , either of @xmath1he or h@xmath0 , in eq .",

    "the picture is similar to the one obtained previously by mantz and edwards  @xcite in a variational description of the adsorption of a single h@xmath0  atom .",

    "as one can see , both functions do not show any significant peak because the density is rather small .",
    "however , the behavior at small interparticle distances is appreciably different . in the layer",
    ", atoms can be closer ( in the in - plane distance @xmath91 ) than in 2d because of the small but nonzero width of the slice used for its calculation .",
    "in fact , we have shown previously in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that , at the density @xmath96 @xmath73 used in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the energies per particle of the layer and the strictly 2d gas start to be significantly different , in agreement with the differences observed here in the distribution function @xmath94 .",
    "a key magnitude in the study of any quantum bose gas is the one - body distribution function @xmath98 since it furnishes evidence of the presence of off - diagonal long - range order in the system .",

    "the condensate fraction approaches one because the density is very small .",
    "when @xmath44 decreases the condensate fraction also decreases and reaches a plateau in the central part of @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath44 is reduced even more and @xmath103 starts to increase , the h@xmath0   condensate fraction decreases again due to the small but nonzero @xmath1he density ; the low statistics in this part makes the signal very noisy and therefore we do not plot data for @xmath104   in fig .",

    "the system is stable and the influence of the liquid substrate is nearly negligible , without the corrugation effects that a solid surface like graphite provides .",
    "moreover , spin - polarized hydrogen is a specially appealing system from the theoretical side because it is the best example of quantum matter ( it remains gas even in the zero temperature limit ) and its interatomic interaction is known with high accuracy . in the present work , we have addressed its study from a microscopic approach relying on the use of quantum monte carlo methods by means of a simulation that incorporates the full hamiltonian of the system , composed by a realistic @xmath1he surface and the layer of h@xmath0  adsorbed on it .    from very low coverages up to relatively high surface densities , we have reported results of the main properties of adsorbed h@xmath0 : energy , density profile , two- and one - body distribution functions , and the condensate fraction .",
    "our results point to a @xmath109    thick layer that virtually _ floats _ on top of @xmath1he .",
    "we have calculated the energy as a function of the surface density @xmath4 and compared these energies with the results obtained in a purely 2d h@xmath0  gas in order to establish the degree of two - dimensionality of the layer .",
    "the agreement between both simulations is only satisfactory for small densities @xmath86 @xmath73 and , from then on , the additional degree of freedom in the @xmath44 direction of the layer causes its energy to grow slower than in strictly 2d .",
    "significant departures of strictly 2d behavior are also observed in the two - body radial distribution function and mainly in the condensate fraction values .",
    "our dmc results show that the condensate fraction for the layer is appreciably higher than in 2d , with values as large as @xmath110 at the largest coverages studied .",
    "if we convert this coverage to volume density by using the layer width of 8  , we see that the condensate fraction is quite close to published 3d values in ref . .",
