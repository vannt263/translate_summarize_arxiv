    "turbulence is characterized by the transfer of an inviscid constant , such as kinetic energy or a passive scalar , between different length scales .",
    "one of the primary goals of turbulence research is to understand the mechanisms that drive this transfer process .",
    "numerical simulations performed by farge _ et al .",
    "_  suggest that in both two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three - dimensional ( 3d ) turbulence it is a relatively small number of `` coherent structures '' that dominate the turbulent dynamics @xcite . as a result",
    ", it is important to understand how the existence and interaction of these coherent structures affect the transfer processes .",
    "thus , the _ spatially - local _ transfer properties of the flow need to be measured and correlated with these structures .    in this manuscript",
    "a tool for obtaining local information about the scale - to - scale transfer of inviscid constants from experimental / numerical data is examined .",
    "the method , called the `` filter approach '' ( fa ) , has traditionally been applied to large - eddy numerical simulations ( les ) @xcite , but is developed here in the context of experimental data analysis . by applying a low - pass spatial filter to the equations of motion ( the incompressible navier - stokes equation ) , separate equations for the filtered , or large - scale , fields and the remaining small - scale fields can be derived @xcite . within",
    "the resulting equations are coupling terms that represent the interaction of the large- and small - scale fields with each other . in les",
    "schemes the coupling terms in the large - scale equations are modeled thereby eliminating the necessity of directly computing the small scales @xcite . in our application of the filter approach , however , data from direct numerical simulations ( dns ) or high resolution experiments are used to directly evaluate the coupling terms and obtain a quasi - local measure of the inter - scale transfer @xcite .    for readers familiar with les and turbulence modeling it",
    "should be stressed that the philosophy driving our use of the filter approach is different from the _ a priori _ development of les models discussed in @xcite . there",
    "the objective was to determine empirically which of several les modeling schemes for the large- to small - scale coupling terms most successfully emulates physical data . in that case , fa was used primarily as a benchmark , and only went as far as measuring the inter - scale coupling term . rather than producing results for numerical benchmarking , fa can also be used as an analysis probe to determine where and when in a flow scale - to - scale transfer of inviscid constants takes place .",
    "in this way one can isolate important interaction events and form an understanding of turbulence inter - scale transfer mechanisms .",
    "of course , this understanding could eventually be incorporated into les models .",
    "the filter approach is applied in this paper to both experimental and numerical data .",
    "the intent is not to investigate the underlying physics of the turbulence , which will be presented in later papers , but rather to determine the appropriate interpretation of the results and the limitations imposed by different filters , spatial boundaries , and finite measurement resolution .",
    "experimental measurements were carried out in a flowing soap - film channel , a quasi-2d system in which decaying turbulence of low to moderate reynolds number can be generated ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the channel was @xmath1 cm wide and was inclined at an angle of @xmath2 with respect to vertical .",
    "the mean flow was @xmath3 @xmath4s and the film thickness was about @xmath5 @xmath6 m . a more detailed description of the channel can be found in @xcite . using the empirical relationships measured in @xcite , the films kinematic viscosity was @xmath7 @xmath8/s . the turbulence generating grid consisted of rods of @xmath9 cm diameter with @xmath10 cm spacing between the rods .",
    "thus , the blocking fraction is around @xmath11 , which is typical for turbulence in 2d soap film flows @xcite .",
    "the resulting reynolds number , @xmath12 , was @xmath13 based on the mean - flow velocity and an injection scale of @xmath14 cm .",
    "the turbulent velocity , @xmath15 , and vorticity , @xmath16 , fields generated by the grid were obtained by tracking @xmath17 @xmath6 m polystyrene spheres ( density approximately @xmath18 g / cc ) within a @xmath19 @xmath8 region located @xmath20 cm downstream from the grid ( 20 - 30 eddy rotation times)@xcite .",
    "the particles were illuminated with a double pulsed nd : yag laser and their images captured by a 12-bit , @xmath21 pixel camera . around @xmath22 particles were individually tracked for each image pair and their velocities and local shears were interpolated to a discrete @xmath23 grid .",

    "the filter approach allows the direct measurement of the coupling between scales in non - linear systems .",

    "i.e. _ les @xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the general application of fa to nonlinear systems will be considered first , followed by a specific example : the case of energy and enstrophy transfer between length scales in 2d turbulence .",
    "general features of the transfer process are examined by considering a field , @xmath39 , that is evolved by a non - linear evolution operator , @xmath40 , as @xmath41 . given a scale , @xmath42 , one can separate the field , @xmath43 , into large - scale , @xmath44 , and small - scale , @xmath45 , components .",
    "this is done by convolving a filter function , @xmath46 , with @xmath43 and defining @xmath47 and @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the dirac delta function . applying @xmath50 to the evolution equation for @xmath43 yields @xmath51 .",

    "( [ eq : general - filter - space ] ) indicates that the large - scale field , @xmath44 , evolves in exactly the same manner as the full field , @xmath43 , up to a coupling term @xmath54 .",
    "this coupling term , which can be considered as an external forcing or damping , arises from the small - scale field , @xmath45 , interacting with @xmath44 .",
    "thus , @xmath55 provides a measure of the interaction between large and small scales .",
    "the measurement of @xmath55 requires no assumptions about the field , @xmath43 , such as homogeneity or isotropy .",
    "moreover , @xmath55 is a _ field _ quantity , not simply an average , and can reveal not only information about the coupling between scales , but also when and where such interactions are taking place and with what strength .",
    "the field nature of the coupling term derived above , @xmath55 , makes fa very valuable in the context of studying turbulence . as mentioned in the introduction , turbulence is characterized by an average scale - to - scale flux of quantities such as the kinetic energy .",
    "many possible mechanisms underlying the transfer processes have been suggested , _",
    "e.g. _ , the stretching of vortex tubes into thin filaments may account for some fraction of the down - scale transfer of energy in 3d @xcite . in 2d",
    ", vortex merger has been postulated as a way of transferring energy to larger scales @xcite .",
    "the difficulty is that neither of these pictures has been conclusively correlated with topological flow structures or the underlying transfer dynamics , though some attempts have been made @xcite . by using fa to measure the inter - scale transfer and correlating this field with the position of flow structures ( identified by other means )",
    ", one can determine the veracity of these hypothesized transfer mechanisms .",
    "there are a number of subtleties to consider when applying fa to experimental data .",
    "first , there is the choice of the filter function , @xmath50 .",
    "the interpretation of the scale - to - scale transfer depends on the selection of the filter function .",
    "for example , if the convolution function is gaussian defined by length scale @xmath42 , the interpretation of the filtered functions is as given above . on the other hand , if the convolution is with the kernel @xmath56 , where again @xmath50 is gaussian and @xmath49 is a dirac delta function , the resulting interpretation of the convolved fields , @xmath57 , as `` large - scale '' is incorrect .",
    "indeed , the function @xmath58 produces `` small - scale '' fields . other ramifications of changing the filter function will be explored shortly but the convention is adopted that the filter function is always low - pass .",
    "two additional considerations when applying fa to real data are finite measurement resolution and the existence of spatial boundaries .",
    "the extent to which the measurements are sensitive to either of these factors depends on the quality of the data and on the form of the filter used .",
    "significant research in the context of les has addressed similar concerns , but always for the purpose of approximating the physical system in a numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "these issues are explored in some depth in a later section .      in two - dimensional turbulence kinetic energy , @xmath59 , and enstrophy , @xmath60 ,",
    "are conserved in the inviscid limit .",
    "theory , numerics , and experiments all indicate that energy is transferred on _ average _ from small to large length scales ( up - scale ) and that enstrophy is transferred in the opposite direction ( down - scale ) @xcite .",
    "fa , however , can be used to obtain much more detailed information about the energy and enstrophy transfer within the flow .",
    "we begin by examining the scale - to - scale coupling of energy in the 2d euler equation ( viscous terms are linear and , hence , cause no direct scale - to - scale transfer , eliminating the need to examine the full navier - stokes equation ) : @xmath61 where @xmath28 is the @xmath29-th component of the velocity field , @xmath62 is the density normalized pressure field , and summation over repeated indices is assumed .",
    "contracting this evolution equation with a filter function , @xmath50 , and extracting the coupling term as described above yields : @xmath63 the notation @xmath64 , or simply @xmath65 , will be used to denote the large - scale field @xmath66 .",
    "( [ eq : large - scale - euler - velocity ] ) is almost the equivalent of eq .",
    "( [ eq : general - filter - space ] ) .",
    "the one delicacy is that the term @xmath67 is not the large - scale pressure field , _ i.e. _ , it is not the field obtained using the gradients of @xmath68 .",
    "this is not an important issue here , however , because , as will be demonstrated later , @xmath67 does not contribute to the inter - scale transfer .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq : large - scale - euler - velocity ] ) the scale - to - scale coupling term for the velocity is given by @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the subgrid - scale stress tensor . to obtain the equation for the evolution of large - scale energy , @xmath71 one multiplies eq .",
    "( [ eq : large - scale - euler - velocity ] ) by @xmath68 .",
    "( note that the notation @xmath72 is used rather than @xmath73 since @xmath74 . )",
    "the resulting equation , @xmath75 for the energy contained at scales larger than @xmath42 , is identical to the full energy evolution equation up to the coupling term on the right hand side ( again ignoring the pressure term ) .",
    "this coupling term is not yet in the form to directly yield scale - to - scale energy transfer information .",
    "there are two ways in which the small - scale velocities can change the large - scale energy : by physically transporting it from point - to - point or by transferring it between scales . to separate the two , the leibnitz rule is used to rewrite the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : large - scale - energy-1 ] ) as @xmath76 notice that the latter of these two terms is galilean invariant , whereas the former is not .",
    "boosts to the reference frame should not change the scale - to - scale transfer of energy but will change the point - to - point transport .",
    "therefore , the former term is attributed to the point - to - point transport and the latter to the scale - to - scale transfer .    another way to contrast",
    "the point - to - point coupling with scale - to - scale coupling is to consider the limit of a homogenous system . in this case",
    "taking an ensemble average , @xmath77 , should eliminate all point - to - point transport terms , leaving only inter - scale transfer contributions . since the action of ensemble averaging commutes with the derivative operation , and since the spatial derivative of an ensemble average is zero in the limit of homogeneity , the ensemble average of eq .",
    "( [ eq : large - scale - energy-1 ] ) is simply @xmath78 not only does this demonstrate that @xmath79 $ ] is a point - to - point term , but it also demonstrates that all of the terms on the left , other than the time derivative , are point - to - point as well .",
    "this fact allows us to ignore the delicacy with respect to the pressure term : it does not affect scale - to - scale transfer .    for simplicity",
    "[ eq : large - scale - energy-1 ] is rewritten as @xmath80 where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are defined as @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the large - scale strain tensor .",
    "the negative sign in the definition of @xmath82 is added so that down - scale transfer has a positive value whereas up - scale transfer is negative .",
    "an almost identical method can be used to determine the scale - to - scale enstrophy transfer of the flow .",
    "the starting point , however , is the 2d euler equation for vorticity , @xmath85 as above , the equation is contracted with a filter function , @xmath50 , and the coupling term is extracted , @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the subgrid scale vorticity transport vector .",
    "notice that the term @xmath88 defined in eq .",
    "[ eq : large - scale - euler - vorticity ] has an almost identical form to @xmath89 in the energy equations .",
    "this general form is typical of the filter approach .",
    "the coupling terms between large- and small - scale fields often take the form @xmath90 for quadratic nonlinearities .    to change the large - scale vorticity equation to an equation for large - scale enstrophy evolution",
    ", one must multiply by @xmath91 .",
    "this yields @xmath92 where again the leibniz rule was used to separate point - to - point transport from inter - scale transfer .",
    "grouping the appropriate terms , as was done for the energy equation , leads to the final form , @xmath93 where @xmath94 where the negative sign in front of the scale - to - scale coupling term , @xmath95 , again makes down - scale transfer positive .    to make the above derivations more concrete ,",
    "some examples are provided of filtered fields . for purposes of illustration , vorticity and enstrophy fields",
    "are presented and an analysis of velocity and energy fields is left to a later publication .",
    "figure [ fig : enstrophy - flux - pictorial ] displays steps in the calculation of the scale - to - scale enstrophy transfer , @xmath95 , for a typical vorticity field extracted from experimental data . for this calculation the filter function was a gaussian with fourier - space definition @xmath96 where @xmath97 .",
    "these figures illustrate that the application of fa is straightforward : ( 1 ) compute the secondary field , @xmath98 , from the measured velocity and vorticity fields ; ( 2 ) perform a convolution of these fields to obtain @xmath99 ; ( 3 ) take the scalar product of @xmath99 with the appropriate gradient of the large - scale fields , namely @xmath100 .",
    "there is , however , a caveat for the general case . it may not always be possible to separate the point - to - point transport from the scale - to - scale transfer terms . for the energy equation , the terms",
    "were determined by using the leibniz rule to separate out the galilean invariant part of the energy flux .",
    "for the enstrophy , the separation was obtained by analogy with the energy equation rather than by a strict application of galilean invariance .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ expectation that such a separation will be as simple , or even possible , for arbitrary nonlinear systems . in compressible flows , for example , it is possible to measure the coupling terms , but the point - to - point transport caused by small scales is tied to the scale - to - scale transfer in a non - trivial way .",
    "the interpretation of such results must , therefore , be done carefully .",
    "this section will address the effect of varying the filter , @xmath50 , on the interpretation of the results , the consequences of the data being limited in spatial extent ( _ i.e. _ by boundaries ) , and variations in the results caused by experimental or numerical limitations on the resolution of the data .       that are used in the paper ( see eq .",

    "a gaussian kernel was used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gaussiankernel ] ) , but this particular choice was made only because it has a simple interpretation in both real- and fourier - space , taking the same form in both .",
    "the fa technique imposes no such constraints in general . in some cases",

    "either possibility can be explored using this tool .",
    "it must be kept in mind , however , that sharpening the filter in real- or fourier - space causes a corresponding broadening of the filter in the other .",

    "similarly , the real - space filters are defined by : @xmath104 note that for @xmath103 , the real filter is equivalent to the fourier filter . as the real filter is sharpened it approaches an area average over a box of diameter @xmath105 . both of these sets of filters",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : filter - kernels ] . other types of filter are possible , but are not considered here .    from an experimental point of view , the sharper real - space filters are more attractive than the fourier filters because the real - space envelope of the fourier filters grows as the order of the filter is increased . since experimental data",
    "is invariably windowed to the cross - section of the measurement apparatus , this means that sharper fourier filters quickly grow to interact with boundaries . for sharp real filters",
    "this is not a problem : as the filter increases in sharpness it becomes more spatially compact . for the purpose of comparing with theory ,",
    "however , sharper fourier filters approach the ideal ; see , for example , the discussion given in frisch @xcite in which the fields are filtered by an infinitely sharp cutoff in fourier - space .    in fig .",

    "the strength of the fluctuations , however , changes with filter ( the grey scale limits of the fields are noted in the captions ) . the change in magnitude is stronger for fourier filters than real - space filters , with the @xmath106 fourier - space filter experiencing @xmath107 larger fluctuations than for @xmath103 .",
    "the similarity in the fields seems to indicate that the _ relative _ magnitudes of enstrophy flux remain more or less constant . in particular , the stronger values of flux associated with powerful vortices ( middle top and middle left ) have almost identical forms , though there may be a slight sharpening of the lobes for both higher order real - space and fourier - space filters ( which , we note , have a quadrupolar form ) .",
    "higher - order fourier - space filters increase the symmetry of many features , _",
    "i.e. _ they appear less ovular ( see for example the lobes indicated by the white arrows in fig .  [",
    "fig : enstrophyflux - ordered ] ) , whereas the contrast between features and the background is enhanced by higher - order real - space filters . on the whole , however , the qualitative features are fairly insensitive to the form of filter used , maybe surprisingly so .",
    "one might expect that the beating of the sharper fourier kernel in real space would show up more strongly in the fields .",
    "for the stronger enstrophy transfer signals this does not appear to be the case .",

    "the boundaries become less of an issue . indeed , for the sharpest real - space filter ( a simple average over a circle ) , the boundary is @xmath124 .",

    "also displayed is the total enstrophy flux ( solid line ) in the simulations.,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]    in this section the effect of finite measurement resolution on the ability of fa to resolve the behavior of the enstrophy flux for a given filter function is explored . in the preceding sections",
    "experimental data was used in the analysis , but to estimate the effects of finite resolution it is necessary to consider numerical data where the range of scales and the uncertainty in the measured values is fairly well known .",
    "the numerical data also eliminates any concerns about the effect of boundaries since the boundary conditions are periodic .",
    "pre - filtering at the limit of the data resolution should result in no apparent difference in the transfer from that computed from the original field . as the pre - filter length , @xmath129 ,",
    "is increased above the resolution scale differences in the measured transfer will increase .",
    "the question this raises is : how far above @xmath129 are these finite - resolution effects felt ? to answer this question a series of @xmath130 order real - space filters with varying @xmath129",
    "are applied to two data sets simulating the local averaging inherent in experimental measurements ( such as image acquisition and particle tracking ) . from these pre - filtered fields the enstrophy transfer , @xmath131 , is calculated and compared with the full flux .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown for both data sets in fig .",
    "[ fig : resolutionanalysis ] . for both",
    ", the viscous cut - off scale is between @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "for pre - filters with @xmath129 at or below this length there is little change in the magnitude of the average flux ( slightly more prominent in the case of hyper - viscosity ) .",
    "once the filter size exceeds the viscous scale , _",
    "i.e. _ , penetrates at all into the inertial range , the effects are quickly felt up to almost the injection scale , @xmath132 .",
    "this may be a general feature of fa , or it may be a peculiarity of the 2d enstrophy transfer process being non - local . in either case , it demonstrates the importance of resolving the entire inertial range , including the viscous scale , for an accurate representation of the enstrophy transfer to be possible .",
    "whether or not enstrophy transfer is local in fourier - space is an important question in its own right , and one which is sufficiently complex to warrant exploration in a separate paper .",
    "in the above discussion and use of fa , familiar turbulence assumptions , such as homogeneity , isotropy , and inertial range , were not requirements of the measurement .",
    "this is perhaps the greatest strength of fa : it can be applied to any type of turbulent flow , regardless of that particular flow s properties .",
    "all that is needed is the evolution equation for the system from which the inter - scale transfer can be obtained .",
    "the flow does nt have to be turbulent , fa can be applied to laminar or periodic flow and reasonable results obtained . in other words ,",
    "the interpretation of fa _ does not rely on a pre - existing theory_. rather , it is a tool that can directly test notions of how inter - scale transfer takes place in systems and can be used to build appropriate theories .",
    "this `` bottom up '' approach to physics ( rather than a theoretical trickle down ) comes at a price : one must have highly resolved fields of data with a significant range of spatial scales .",
    "the former is a requirement imposed by the resolution issues discussed above , which can only be relaxed if one assumes a wavenumber local inter - scale transfer process .",
    "the latter is a limitation imposed by the data windowing and interaction of the filters with the measurement boundary . of course",
    ", the standard techniques of measuring velocity fields in fluids , namely particle imaging velocimetry or particle tracking , more or less ensure that the measurements are not far from the viscous scale , and thus of high enough resolution to not assume local transfer .",
    "this is because these techniques rely on groups of particles moving coherently , which only holds when the scales being probed are small enough that local taylor expansions describe the flow .",
    "the difficulty is in simultaneously measuring a significant range of scales above the viscous scale for meaningful information to be obtained . with standard piv practices this is possible in 2d . only with holographic piv",
    "is this possible in 3d .",
    "there , however , the limitation is in the amount of data that can be obtained ( order 10 fields is possible ; currently , 1000 fields are not ) .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , our ultimate intention for the fa technique is to probe the mechanisms driving the inter - scale transfer in 2d turbulence , with a particular eye towards the role of coherent structures in the transfer process .",
    "this will be done both via statistical analysis of fields in the laboratory frame of reference ( eularian frame ) , as well as following the motion of fluid parcels ( lagrangian frame ) .",
    "fa , however , is not limited to these measurements alone , but could find application to the inter - scale transfer and mixing of passive scalars , or other quantities not necessarily conserved in the inviscid limit ( _ i.e. _ local topology ) . and as hinted at previously , fa can be applied ( carefully ! ! ! ) to general non - linear systems where an equation of motion is known and inter - scale transfer is of interest .",
