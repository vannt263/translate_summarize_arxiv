    "in addition to their high transition temperatures and the d@xmath4 symmetry of their superconducting state , the cuprate superconductors possess a remarkable range of normal state anomalies . seen first as charge response anomalies in transport , raman , and optical experiments , and subsequently as spin response anomalies in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments , recent specific heat and angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments have shown that these anomalies are accompanied by , and may indeed originate in , anomalous planar quasiparticle behavior .",
    "it is convenient to discuss the temperature and doping dependence of this `` uniformly '' anomalous behavior in terms of the schematic phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "there one sees that overdoped and underdoped systems may be distinguished by the extent to which these exhibit crossover behavior in the normal state : underdoped systems exhibit two distinct crossovers in normal state behavior before going superconducting , while overdoped systems pass directly from a single class of anomalous normal state behavior to the superconducting state  @xcite . in a broader perspective of this schematic phase diagram , which is applicable to the yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath7 , yba@xmath5cu@xmath8o@xmath9 , bi@xmath5sr@xmath5ca@xmath10cu@xmath5o@xmath11 , hgba@xmath5cuo@xmath12 , hgba@xmath5ca@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath13 and tl@xmath5ba@xmath5ca@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath14 systems , if one defines an optimally doped system as that which possesses the highest superconducting transition temperature within a given family , then optimally doped systems are in fact underdoped .",
    "attempts to understand the different regimes of this phase diagram have been based on strong magnetic precursors  @xcite , the formation of dynamical charge modulations in form of stripes  @xcite , the appearance of preformed cooper pairs above @xmath15  @xcite , or the separation of spin and charge degrees of freedom  @xcite .    a phase diagram similar to fig .",
    "1 was independently derived from studies of the charge response by hwang , batlogg , and their collaborators  @xcite and from an analysis of the low frequency nmr experiments  @xcite by barzykin and pines  @xcite .",
    "the latter authors identified the upper crossover temperature , t@xmath16 , from measurements of the uniform susceptibility , @xmath17 , in knight shift experiments , which show that for underdoped systems @xmath17 possesses a maximum at a temperature t@xmath16 , which in underdoped systems , increases rapidly from t@xmath18 as the doping level is reduced . the fall - off in susceptibility for temperatures below t@xmath16",
    "was first studied in detail by alloul _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and led friedel  @xcite to propose that it might arise from a near spin density wave ( sdw ) instability ; he coined the term pseudogap to explain its behavior , in analogy to the quasiparticle pseudogap seen in charge density wave ( cdw ) systems .",
    "barzykin and pines identified further crossover behavior in this pseudogap regime by examining the behavior of the @xmath19cu nuclear spin - lattice relaxation time , @xmath20 , as the temperature was reduced below t@xmath16 .",
    "they noted that between t@xmath16 and a lower crossover temperature , t@xmath21 , the product , @xmath22 decreases linearly in temperature , while shortly below t@xmath21 this product has a minimum , followed by an increase as the temperature is further lowered , an increase which is strongly suggestive of gap - like behavior .",
    "they proposed that these two crossovers were accompanied by changes in dynamical scaling behavior which could be measured directly if nmr measurements of @xmath20 could be accompanied by measurements of the spin - echo decay time , @xmath23 . above t@xmath16 they argued that the ratio , @xmath24 , would be independent of temperature , a result equivalent to arguing that the characteristic energy of the spin fluctuations , @xmath25 , would be proportional to the inverse square of the antiferromagnetic correlation length , @xmath26 . between t@xmath16 and t@xmath21 they proposed that the ratio , @xmath27 would be independent of temperature , which means that an underdoped system would exhibit @xmath28 scaling behavior ,",
    "i.e. @xmath25 would be proportional to @xmath29 ; below t@xmath21 they found that the increase in @xmath25 would be accompanied by a freezing out of the temperature - dependent antiferromagnetic correlations ; i.e. @xmath29 , which was proportional to @xmath30 between t@xmath16 and t@xmath21 , would approach a constant.this behavior has recently been confirmed in nmr measurements on yba@xmath5cu@xmath8o@xmath13 by curro _",

    "@xcite .",
    "because pseudogap behavior is found both between t@xmath16 and t@xmath21 , and between t@xmath21 and t@xmath18 , the terms weak pseudogap and strong pseudogap behavior were coined to distinguish between the two regimes  @xcite .",
    "thus in the weak pseudogap regime one finds @xmath28 pseudoscaling ( because the scaling behavior is not universal ) behavior , with both @xmath25 and @xmath29 exhibiting linear in @xmath33 behavior , while the rapid increase in @xmath34 , or what is equivalent , @xmath25 , found below t@xmath21 suggests that strong pseudogap is an appropriate descriptor for this behavior .",
    "an alternative perspective on weak and strong pseudogap behavior comes from arpes  @xcite and tunneling experiments  @xcite , which focus directly on single particle excitations .",
    "above t@xmath21 , arpes experiments show that the spectral density of quasiparticles located near the @xmath35 part of the brillouin zone , develops a high energy feature , a result which suggests that the transfer of spectral weight from low energies to high energies for part of the quasiparticle spectrum may be the physical origin of the weak pseudogap behavior seen in nmr experiments .",
    "below t@xmath21 , arpes experiments disclose the presence of a leading - edge gap , a momentum - dependent shift of the lowest binding energy relative to the chemical potential by an amount up to @xmath36 for quasiparticles near @xmath35 ; it seems natural to associate the strong pseudogap behavior seen in the nmr experiments with this leading edge gap .",
    "recent tunneling experiments have shown that both the high energy feature ( i.e. weak pseudogap behavior ) and the strong single particle pseudogap can also be observed in the tunneling conductance , with the high energy feature occurring primarily in the occupied part of the spectrum .",
    "strong pseudogap behavior is also seen in specific heat , d.c .",
    "transport , optical experiments , and raman experiments .",
    "below @xmath3 , a reduced scattering rate for frequencies @xmath37 has been extracted from the optical conductivity using a single band picture  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that excitations in the pseudogap regime are more coherent then expected by extrapolation from higher temperatures .",
    "this point of view is supported by recent raman experiments  @xcite which observe in the b@xmath38-channel , sensitive to single particle states around @xmath1 , a suppression of the broad incoherent raman continuum and a rather sharp structure at about twice the single particle gap of arpes experiments  @xcite .",
    "resistivity measurements also show that below @xmath3 the systems gets more conducting than one would have expected from the linear resistivity at higher temperatures  @xcite .",
    "it is natural to believe that the pseudogap in the spin damping , as observed in @xmath34 measurements , the single particle pseudogap of arpes and tunneling experiments , and the pseudogap of the scattering rate are closely related and must be understood simultaneously .",
    "furthermore , it is essential for any theory of the strong pseudogap to account properly for the already existent anomalies above @xmath3 , because they are likely caused by the same underlying effective interactions . as can be seen by inspection of fig .",
    "[ fi1 ] , strong pseudogap behavior in underdoped cuprates only occurs once the system has passed the weak pseudogap state .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the weak pseudogap ( pseudoscaling ) regime above @xmath3 and give a more detailed account of the preliminary results we obtained using a spin - fluctuation model of normal state behavior  @xcite .",
    "it is our aim to provide a quantitative understanding for @xmath39 of quantities reflecting strong pseudogap behavior below @xmath3 .",
    "we derive a novel solution of the spin fermion model in the quasi - static limit @xmath0 , relevant for the intermediate weak pseudogap regime of the phase diagram .",
    "we demonstrate that the broad high energy features of the spectral density found in arpes measurements of underdoped cuprates are determined by strong antiferromagnetic correlations and incoherent precursor effects of an sdw state .",
    "the spectral density at the fermi energy and the electron - spin fluctuation vertex function are strongly anisotropic , leading to qualitatively different behavior of _ hot _",
    "( around @xmath1 ) and _ cold _ ( around @xmath40 ) momentum states , whereas the fermi surface itself changes only slightly .",
    "we present new results for the effective interaction of quasiparticles with spin and charge collective modes . in distinction to the strong coupling of hot quasiparticles to spin excitations",
    ", we demonstrate that their renormalized coupling to charge degrees of freedom , including phonons , is strongly suppressed .",
    "finally , we show that the onset temperature , @xmath41 , of weak pseudogap behavior is determined by the strength , @xmath26 , of the af correlations .",
    "our theory also allows us to investigate the low frequency spin and charge response functions . in a subsequent publication",
    ", we will discuss the suppression of the spin damping and further generic changes in low frequency magnetic behavior seen in nmr experiments as well as the optical response , particularly as far as the b@xmath38-raman continuum is concerned .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize important findings of arpes results which will later on be explained by our theory of the weak pseudogap regime .",
    "next , we give the basic concept of the spin fluctuation model and derive the spin fermion model . in the following ,",
    "fourth , section we discuss in detail our solution of the spin fermion model in the quasi - static limit , with particular attention to the new physics of the spin fermion model for intermediate coupling .",
    "our solution is obtained by the complete summation of the perturbation series , and is motivated in part by a theory for one dimensional charge density wave systems developed by sadovskii  @xcite .",
    "we have extended his theory to the case of two spatial dimensions and isotropic spin fluctuations and , in so doing , found that we could avoid several technical problems of the earlier approach .",
    "technical details of the rules we used for computing diagrams are presented in appendix  [ app_gf ] and b. readers not interested in these technical aspects can skip the theory section and should be able to follow the discussion of our results for the spectral density and vertex functions in the fifth and sixth sections , respectively .",
    "in particular , results for the single particle properties are discussed at length and compared with arpes experiments .",
    "finally our theory for the weak pseudogap regime is summarized in the last section , where we also consider the physics of the strong pseudogap state and summarize some predictions and consequences of our theory .",
    "we argue that a proper description of the higher temperature weak pseudogap regime is essential for a further investigation of the low temperature strong pseudogap state and argue that the strong pseudogap state and precursors in the pairing channel are the quantum manifestation of strong antiferromagnetic correlations whereas the spin density wave precursors are the classical manifestation of it .",
    "arpes experiments offer a powerful probe of the quasiparticle properties of cuprates .",
    "since they provide unusually strong experimental constraints for any theory of optimally doped and underdoped cuprate superconductors , we summarize in this section the main experimental results obtained by this experimental technique    in fig .",
    "[ fa1 ] , we show arpes spectra close to the momentum @xmath42 , for two different doping concentrations  @xcite . while for the overdoped",
    ", @xmath43 , sample a rather sharp peak occurs , which crosses the fermi energy , the spectral density of the underdoped , @xmath44 , sample exhibits instead a very broad maximum at approximately @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the entire line - shape changes character as the doping is reduced .",
    "the other important difference between the two charge carrier concentrations is the appearance of the leading edge gap ( leg ) , i.e. a shift of the lowest binding energy relative to the chemical potential , for the underdoped system .",
    "this leg varies between @xmath46 and @xmath36 and is therefore hardly visible in fig .",
    "[ fa1 ] , but is discussed in detail in ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition to this strong doping dependence , the spectral function of underdoped systems is also very anisotropic in momentum space , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fa2 ] . here",
    ", the position of local maxima of the spectral function along certain high symmetry lines of the brillouin zone is shown for an overdoped and underdoped system .",
    "this is usually done because the maxima of the spectral density correspond to the position of the quasiparticle energy .",
    "however , as we discuss in detail below , this interpretation is not correct in underdoped systems for momentum states close to @xmath35 where the line - shape changes qualitatively .",
    "close to @xmath35 , one sees for overdoped systems , in agreement with fig .",
    "[ fa1 ] , a peak at low binding energy , which crosses the fermi energy between @xmath35 and @xmath47 , whereas the @xmath45 high energy feature is the only visible structure for the underdoped system .",
    "it is flat and seems even repelled from the fermi energy between @xmath35 and @xmath47 .",
    "the situation is different for momentum states along the diagonal , where a rather sharp peak crosses the fermi energy between @xmath48 and @xmath49 ; the velocity of the latter states , seen in the slope of their dispersion in fig .",
    "[ fa2 ] , is independent of the doping value , while no leg has been observed for those quasiparticle states .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors constructed the fermi surface for the two doping regimes by determining the @xmath50-points where a maximum of the spectral function crosses the fermi energy .",
    "their results are re - plotted in fig .",
    "consistent with fig .",
    "[ fa2 ] a large fermi surface occurs for the overdoped material , whereas only a small fermi surface sector close to the diagonal could be identified in the underdoped case .",
    "even though this appears to be in agreement with the formation of a hole pocket closed around @xmath49 , with reduced intensity on the other half of the pocket , arpes data below the superconducting transition temperature , shown in fig .",
    "[ fa4 ] , show that for momenta close to @xmath35 , a sharp peak appears at lower binding energy .",
    "this behavior , for the underdoped case is completely consistent with a large fermi surface which is only gapped due to the superconducting state .",
    "the obvious question arises : how could a transformation from a small to a large fermi surface occur on entering the superconducting state ?    we should also mention that in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors showed that the two energy scales ( the leg and the high energy feature ) behave as function of doping in a fashion which is quite reminiscent of the two temperature scales , @xmath3 and @xmath41 , shown in fig .",
    "this leads us immediately to two conjectures : 1 .",
    "there is a relationship of the physics of the upper crossover temperature @xmath41 and the high energy feature , as well as between the strong pseudogap temperature @xmath3 and the leg .",
    "2 . as a strong pseudogap state",
    "is impossible without a weak pseudogap state at higher temperatures , the leg can only appear after the system has established the high energy features .    as noted above",
    ", these fascinating experimental results represent a set of very strong constraints for the microscopic description of underdoped cuprates we develop below .",
    "the nearly antiferromagnetic fermi liquid ( nafl ) model  @xcite of the cuprates offers a possible explanation for the observed weak and strong pseudogap behavior .",
    "it is based on the spin fluctuation model , in which the magnetic interaction between the quasiparticles of the cuo@xmath5 planes is responsible for the anomalous normal state properties and the superconducting state with high @xmath51 and d@xmath4 pairing state  @xcite . in a recent letter ,",
    "we have shown how the weak pseudogap regime can be understood within this nafl - scenario  @xcite .    in common with many other approaches , within the spin fluctuation model",
    "the planar quasiparticles are assumed to be characterized by a starting spectrum which reflects their barely itinerant character , and which takes into account both nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor hopping , according to @xmath52 where @xmath53 , the nearest neighbor hopping term , @xmath54 ev , while the next nearest neighbor hopping term , @xmath55 , may vary between @xmath56 for yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath57 and @xmath58 for la@xmath59sr@xmath60cuo@xmath8 .    in distinction to many other models , the spin fluctuation model starts from the ansatz that the highly anisotropic effective planar quasiparticle interaction mirrors the dynamical spin susceptibility  @xcite , @xmath61 peaked near @xmath62 , via : @xmath63 an ansatz which enables us to construct directly a theory which focuses solely on the relevant low energy degrees of freedom . in eq .",
    "[ eff_int ] , @xmath64 is the coupling constant characterizing the interaction strength of the planar quasiparticles with their own collective spin excitations . in this model ,",
    "changes in quasiparticle behavior both reflect and bring about the measured changes in spin dynamics . the dynamic susceptibility , eq .",
    "[ mmp ] , was introduced by millis , monien , and pines  @xcite to explain nmr experiments , which can be used to determine the correlation length , @xmath26 , the constant scale factor , @xmath65 , and the energy scale @xmath25 , which characterizes the over - damped nature of the spin excitations .",
    "it follows from the experimental data that the static staggered spin susceptibility @xmath66 is large compared to the uniform spin susceptibility , @xmath67 , and the relaxational mode energy correspondingly small compared to the planar quasiparticle band width  @xcite . for optimally doped and underdoped systems",
    "one finds that over a considerable regime of temperatures , @xmath68 and it is only as @xmath33 falls below @xmath3 that @xmath25 becomes comparable to and eventually larger than @xmath69 . in detail , between @xmath3 and @xmath41 one finds : @xmath70 for yba@xmath5cu@xmath8o@xmath13 and @xmath71 for yba@xmath5cu@xmath6o@xmath72 rather independent of @xmath33  @xcite . as a result of this comparatively low characteristic energy found in the weak pseudogap region , the spin system , for @xmath73 ,",
    "is thermally excited and behaves quasi - statically  @xcite ; the quasiparticles see a spin system which acts like a static deformation potential , a behavior which is no longer found below @xmath3 where @xmath25 increases rapidly  @xcite and the lowest energy scale is the temperature itself .",
    "since the dynamical spin susceptibility @xmath74 peaks at wave vectors close to @xmath47 , two different kinds of quasiparticles emerge  @xcite : _ hot quasiparticles _ with @xmath75 located close to those momentum points on the fermi surface which can be connected by @xmath76 , feel the full effects of the interaction of eq .",

    "close to @xmath15 , typical values for @xmath26 of underdoped but superconducting cuprates are @xmath80 , depending on doping concentration  @xcite ; @xmath81 is the magnitude of a typical fermi velocity in the corresponding momentum regions .",
    "the distinct lifetimes of hot and cold quasiparticles can be obtained from transport experiments : a detailed analysis shows that , due to the almost singular interaction , the behavior of the hot quasiparticles is highly anomalous , while cold quasiparticles may be characterized as a strongly coupled landau fermi liquid  @xcite .",
    "the presence of incommensurate peaks in the spin fluctuation spectrum  @xcite , and hence in the nafl interaction , although difficult to calculate , may be expected to amplify the role played by hot quasiparticles in the determination of system behavior .    in the spin fluctuation model the anomalous behavior of the cuprates",
    "is assumed to originate in a strong interaction between fermionic spins @xmath82 which brings about intermediate range ( @xmath83 ) antiferromagnetic spin correlations and over - damped spin modes . here",

    "[ act_spinf ] , we implicitly assume that the effect of all other high energy degrees of freedom , which are integrated out to obtain the action @xmath89 , do not affect the fermi liquid character of the quasiparticles . in eq .",
    "[ act_spinf ] , the effective spin - spin interaction is assumed to be fully renormalized ; thus it reflects the changes in quasiparticle behavior it brings about , and can be taken from fits to nmr and ins experiments .",
    "we will also assume that the spin degrees of freedom are completely isotropic and that all three components of the spin vector are equally active .",
    "in the case of a intermediate correlation lengths @xmath90 , this is the appropriate description of the spin degrees of freedom . only for much larger @xmath91 , does one enter the regime in which even without long range order only two transverse spin degrees of freedom are active  @xcite .",
    "the physics of the crossover , driven by a collective - mode collective - mode interaction , between these two regimes , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the quantities of primary interest to us are the single particle green s function @xmath92 which provides information about the quasiparticle spectral density determined in angular resolved photo - emission experiments , the dynamical spin susceptibility itself , and the corresponding charge response functions .",
    "as noted above , in calculating these quantities for intermediate correlation lengths the interaction between the collective spin modes is irrelevant . in appendix  [ app_gf ]",
    "we show that under these circumstances the green s function @xmath93 can be expressed as a gaussian average @xmath94 of electron propagators with a time dependent magnetic potential @xmath95 , with respect to collective bosonic spin 1 variables @xmath96 . the corresponding model is often referred to as the spin fermion model .",
    "we give in appendix  [ app_gf ] the diagrammatic rules of this problem , which will be essential for the solution of the spin fermion model in the quasistatic limit . in the next two sections ,",
    "we derive new expressions for the single particle green s function , and the spin - fermion and charge - fermion vertex functions of the quasistatic two dimensional spin fermion model , valid for intermediate values of the spin fermion coupling , by extending an earlier study by sadovskii  @xcite for one dimensional charge density wave systems .",
    "we begin this section by first motivating the quasistatic limit and discussing its physical consequences by investigating the second order diagram with respect to the coupling constant @xmath64 .",

    "while the fermi surface of the quasiparticles remains unchanged their highly anisotropic effective interaction leads to two different classes of quasiparticles , _ hot _ and _ cold _ , with only the hot quasiparticles feeling the full strength of the antiferromagnetic interaction . for the latter , a transfer of spectral weight to high energy features occurs .",
    "these high energy features are the incoherent precursors of a spin density wave state ; their momentum dependence is in excellent agreement with corresponding high energy structures at around @xmath45 seen in recent arpes experiments . for low energies ,",
    "hot quasiparticles have a reduced spectral weight , a weak pseudogap characteristic , and the coherent quasiparticle poles are completely over - damped due to the strong scattering rate .",
    "the drop in scattering rate found in the strong pseudogap state is not sufficient to make this quasiparticle pole visible .",
    "it is only below @xmath51 that the rate drops sufficiently that the pole becomes visible .",
    "this scenario explains the appearance of a sharp peak , invisible above @xmath51 , at low frequencies in the superconducting state of underdoped cuprates .",
    "the high energy features on the other hand are expected to be unchanged as temperature is lowered .",
    "finally , we used our calculation of the irreducible vertex functions to investigate the effective interaction of the quasiparticles with spin and charge modes .",
    "we find that this effective interaction is likewise highly anisotropic ; the low energy electron - spin fluctuation interaction is strongly enhanced whereas the coupling to charge degrees of freedom is reduced .",
    "the enhancement of the spin vertex is essential for the development of a spin fluctuation induced superconducting state and is an indicator as well of anomalous behavior at lower temperatures .",
    "the reduction of the charge vertex causes a reduced electron - phonon coupling constant for hot quasiparticles as well as a decoupling of hot quasiparticles from potential charge collective modes .",
    "this scenario applies , as discussed , for temperatures between @xmath3 and @xmath41 .",
    "below @xmath3 , the characteristic frequency of the spin system increases for decreasing temperature , making it impossible to consider the system as exhibiting quasistatic behavior .",
    "thus , here we expect that the quantum nature of the spin degrees of freedom becomes essential ; it brings about a strongly reduced phase space for the inelastic scattering of quasiparticles and spin fluctuations , and causes a sudden drop in the corresponding scattering rate of the system . nevertheless , since we expect the high energy features to remain unchanged , the spectral weight of hot quasiparticles is strongly reduced while their interaction is enhanced .",
    "this strong coupling behavior can bring about precursor to superconducting state behavior , as recently discussed by chubukov  @xcite , who found that at zero temperature , the quantum behavior of the spin modes causes a leading edge gap of the spectral function within a magnetic scenario for cuprates .",
    "it has recently been shown that this leading edge gap will be filled with states once the temperature is raised , and that it basically disappears for @xmath288 , with @xmath289  @xcite . above this temperature ,",
    "the system starts to behave quasistatically and the superconducting precursors are suppressed . within the same scenario ,",
    "one thus finds that the classical behavior of spin fluctuations favors magnetic precursors and causes an increase of the low energy interaction , which leads for lower temperatures to superconducting precursors due to the quantum behavior of the spin fluctuations .",
    "this provides perhaps the first consistent picture of the microscopic origin of the two pseudogap regimes and their crossover temperatures : the strong pseudogap state and the leading edge gap are the quantum manifestation of strong antiferromagnetic correlations whereas the spin density wave precursors are its classical manifestation .    what are the consequences of this new microscopic scenario for the crossover behavior of underdoped cuprates ?",
    "our theory predicts that upon measuring the uniform susceptibility @xmath290 and the spectral function for an slightly underdoped or optimally doped system , ( for which @xmath41 is not too high ) , it will turn out that above @xmath41 , where @xmath290 is maximal , the high energy features will disappear .",
    "we also expect important insights into the role of impurities and high magnetic fields .",
    "non - magnetic impurities should affect the weak pseudogap state only slightly .",
    "their strongest effect will occur slightly below @xmath41 where impurities cause @xmath26 to decrease to @xmath291 .",
    "provided @xmath292 , an impurity driven transition out of the weak pseudogap state occurs .",
    "@xmath3 will be considerably more sensitive to impurities because for particle - particle excitations with a tendency to d - wave pairing , non - magnetic impurities act destructively and the strong pseudogap state may even completely disappear .",
    "high magnetic fields provide another indicator of the differences between strong and weak pseudogap behavior . in the weak pseudogap regime",
    "no sensible effects for all achievable field strengths will occur , because the relevant coupling of the magnetic field is the zeeman interaction with the spins , @xmath293 , which has to compete with the much stronger short range correlations of these spins . in the strong pseudogap state",
    ", we expect that the dephasing due to the minimal coupling @xmath294 will strongly affect the behavior in the pairing channel , causing a suppression of strong pseudogap behavior . from this perspective",
    ", it immediately follows that the transport experiments by ando _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in a pulsed high magnetic field demonstrate that weak pseudogap behavior is prolonged to lower temperatures .",
    "it is tempting to speculate that for very strong magnetic fields the weak pseudogap regime crosses directly over into an insulating one .    in general",
    ", for decreasing temperature the weak pseudogap regime can therefore cross over to a strong pseudogap state or to an insulator and , under certain circumstances , directly into the superconducting state .",
    "the latter may occur for systems with very large incommensuration , which tend to reduce the scattering rate of a quasistatic spin system .",

    "<S> 54.8pt 54.8pt we use a novel solution of the spin fermion model which is valid in the quasi - static limit @xmath0 , found in the intermediate ( pseudoscaling ) regime of the magnetic phase diagram of cuprate superconductors , to obtain results for the temperature and doping dependence of the single particle spectral density , the electron - spin fluctuation vertex function , and the low frequency dynamical spin susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting strong anisotropy of the spectral density and the vertex function lead to the qualitatively different behavior of _ hot _ ( around @xmath1 ) and _ cold _ ( around @xmath2 ) quasiparticles seen in arpes experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the broad high energy features found in arpes measurements of the spectral density of the underdoped cuprate superconductors are determined by strong antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations and incoherent precursor effects of an sdw state , with reduced renormalized effective coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> due to this transfer of spectral weight to higher energies , the low frequency spectral weight of _ hot _ states is strongly reduced but couples very strongly to the spin excitations of the system . for realistic values of the antiferromagnetic correlation length , their fermi surface changes its general shape only slightly but the strong scattering of hot states makes the fermi surface crossing invisible above a pseudogap temperature @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the electron spin - fluctuation vertex function , i.e. the effective interaction of low energy quasiparticles and spin degrees of freedom , is found to be strongly anisotropic and enhanced for hot quasiparticles ; the corresponding charge - fluctuation vertex is considerably diminished . </S>",
    "<S> we thus demonstrate that , once established , strong af correlations act to reduce substantially the effective electron - phonon coupling constant in cuprate superconductors .    2 </S>"
