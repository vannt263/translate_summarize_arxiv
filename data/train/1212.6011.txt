    "during the last decades , density functional theory ( dft ) has proven its pivotal role for computational studies in the fields of condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry .",
    "particularly the kohn - sham ( ks ) formalism of dft has gained enormous popularity as an _ ab initio _ method applicable to relatively large systems .",
    "an essential ingredient for many large scale implementations of ks - dft are pseudopotentials which are also frequently denoted as effective core potentials . by eliminating the strongly bound core electrons pseudopotentials",
    "reduce the number of occupied electronic orbitals that have to be treated in an electronic structure calculation . in addition",
    "the valence wavefunctions arising from a pseudopotential are much smoother than the all - electron valence wavefunction in the core region , since the orthogonality constraints to the rapidly - varying wavefunctions carrying core electrons are missing .",
    "since it is not necessary to describe rapidly varying wavefunctions the size of the basis set used for their representation can be reduced .",
    "these two factors lead to a significant reduction of the computational effort of a pseudopotential calculation compared to an all - electron calculation .    even though it is well known that the valence electrons are responsible for the majority of chemical and physical properties of atoms , pseudopotentials have to be constructed very carefully in order to reproduce the properties of the all - electron atom accurately .",
    "if a pseudoatom , i.e an atom described by a pseudopotential , reproduces the all - electron behavior accurately for any chemical environment the pseudopotential is said to be transferable .",
    "pseudopotentials ( psp s ) are an essential ingredient of most electronic structure codes and different solutions are implemented in present - day dft codes .",
    "traditional norm - conserving ( nc ) approaches , e.g.  @xcite are formally the simplest approach , since they give rise to pseudowavefunctions which lead to a valid charge density . by introducing atomic like orbitals as additional basis functions any atomic hamiltonian arising either from an all - electron potential or from a norm conserving pseudopotential  @xcite can be transformed into an linearized augmented plane wave ( lapw ) like hamiltonian  @xcite .",
    "the widespread projector - augmented wave ( paw ) methods  @xcite and the ultrasoft pseudopotentials  @xcite are derived by such a transformation from an all - electron atom hamiltonian .",
    "the number of required basis functions is reduced by this transformation , but the calculation of the charge density is more complicated and a generalized eigenvalue problem has to be solved even for the case of an orthogonal basis set . for applications in quantum chemistry ,",
    "effective core potentials  @xcite are often optimized for a certain basis set and usually employed for heavier elements only . in this paper , the dual space gaussian pseudopotentials of goedecker - teter - hutter ( gth ) and hartwigsen - goedecker - hutter ( hgh )  @xcite psp are generalized by the inclusion of a non - linear core correction ( nlcc ) term .",
    "these new pseudopotentials are able to provide an accuracy that is comparable to that of the very best all - electron calculations .",
    "the starting point for understanding why pseudopotentials work is the subdivision of space into muffin - tin spheres centered on the atom in a molecule or solid and the remaining interstitial region  @xcite .",
    "a non - selfconsistent schrdinger equation can be solved exactly in the interstitial region if one knows the scattering properties on the surface of the muffin - tin spheres  @xcite .",
    "the scattering properties are typically specified by the logarithmic derivative as a function of energy .",
    "this function is the quotient of the radial outward derivative and the functional value of the wavefunction on the surface of the muffin - tin sphere . in this way the boundary conditions are specified which are necessary to integrate the schrdinger equation , a second order partial differential equation where the amplitude of the solution is fixed by a normalization constraint .",
    "a necessary but not sufficient condition for a pseudopotential to be transferable is therefore that the logarithmic derivatives of the all - electron and pseudo - atom agree over the relevant energy interval .",
    "the construction of pseudopotentials is typically done using as the reference state a neutral isolated atom which has been spherically symmetrized .",
    "this symmetrization can be achieved by using identical and generally fractional occupation numbers for all the orbitals with the same @xmath0 and @xmath1 quantum numbers , e.g. for the set of @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 orbitals .",
    "the norm conservation condition  @xcite ensures that the logarithmic derivative function describes well the scattering properties of a muffin - tin sphere containing the charge distribution of this reference configuration .",
    "in a selfconsistent calculation the charge distribution changes however when the free atom is inserted in a molecule or solid and the potential in the muffin - tin region will in general differ from the potential within a muffin - tin sphere of the same radius around the reference atom . hence the scattering properties change and the pseudopotential constructed using the charge distribution in the muffin - tin sphere of the isolated atom might not well reproduce these modified scattering properties of a new chemical environment . due to",
    "screening effects there exists however an invariant muffin - tin sphere within which the total electronic charge distribution is nearly independent of the chemical environment  @xcite .",
    "the radius of this invariant muffin - tin sphere is a fraction of the covalent bondlength and thus considerably smaller than the muffin - tin radii used in other methods such as the lapw method .",
    "the scattering properties of this invariant muffin - tin sphere hardly vary as a function of the chemical environment of the atom .",
    "if the separable terms of a pseudopotential as well as the difference between the local part of the pseudopotentials and the pure coulombic potential remain localized within this invariant sphere the pseudopotential is expected to be highly transferable .",
    "this recipe was followed in the construction of the gth  @xcite and hgh  @xcite pseudopotentials which are indeed well transferable for non - spinpolarized systems .    despite the fact that the total charge in the invariant muffin - tin sphere is nearly identical in different chemical environments ,",
    "the spin polarization is not , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ptransfer ] . shown",
    "are the changes in the radial charge and spin densities if one adds half an electron to the unoccupied spin channel of the @xmath5-orbital . for spin",
    "polarized calculations the concept of an invariant muffin - tin sphere is therefore not applicable .",
    "one possibility to overcome this problem is to construct pseudopotentials which have an explicit spin dependence  @xcite .",
    "the other possibility is to include nonlinear core corrections ( nlcc )  @xcite in the pseudopotential .    in the nlcc schemes the spin and charge densities in the muffin - tin sphere are not just the ones from the valence electrons treated explicitly by the pseudopotential but they are both the respective sums of the valence charge and the core charge given by the nonlinear core correction .",
    "since the core electrons can be considered to be frozen , i.e to be invariant with respect to different chemical environments , this core charge is fixed once and for all .",
    "it is obvious that the spin polarization , i.e. the quantity @xmath6 is very poorly represented without a core charge .",
    "if for instance all valence orbitals are spin up then the spin down charge density @xmath7 would be zero and the spin polarization @xmath8 would be equal to one . in the real atom @xmath8",
    "is not equal to one in the core region since the core electrons are never spin polarized . since the density of the core electrons is much larger than the density of the valence electrons in the core region the spin polarization actually has typically small values .",
    "these correct small values of @xmath8 are reestablished by the core charge of a nlcc pseudopotential and exchange correlation functionals can provide reliable total energies .",
    "nonlinear core corrections have therefore the potential to substantially improve the description of spin polarized states .    whereas previous implementations of nlcc pseudopotentials  @xcite tried to faithfully represent the core charge ,",
    "we follow here another approach . in the spirit of the gth pseudopotentials where all terms have simple parametrized analytical forms we also represent the core charge density just as one single gaussian . the amplitude and width of this gaussian core charge distribution",
    "are then optimized by a fitting procedure in the same way as the other parameters of the pseudopotential .",
    "the procedure for constructing the nlcc pseudopotentials is very similar to the one used for the construction of the gth and hgh pseudopotential .",
    "in contrast to the original gth and hgh pseudopotentials which were fitted to a single atomic configuration , the new nlcc pseudopotentials are fitted not only to the ground state but also to several excited and ionized electronic configurations where half an electron is added or removed possibly to or from different valence orbitals .",
    "the atoms are always considered to be spherically symmetric , but some of the configurations used for the fit have a spin polarization .",
    "the parameters of the dual space gaussian ansatz  @xcite are fitted such that :    * the occupied and first few unoccupied valence eigenvalues of the all - electron and pseudo atom match for all configurations used in the fit . *",
    "the charge inside the inert region of the pseudo atom matches the all - electron valence charge in the same region for all the orbitals for which the eigenvalues are matched for all configurations used in the fit .",
    "this means that the pseudopotential is norm conserving for all the configurations used in the fit .",
    "* a high precision of @xmath9 a.u . is achieved for valence eigenvalues and charge integrals of the non - polarized ground state , whereas only a moderate precision of @xmath10 a.u .",
    "is enforced for all other orbitals and configurations considered . *",
    "the total energy differences of the all - electron atom are reproduced for all configurations used in the fit . *",
    "the spin polarization energies of the all - electron atom are reproduced for all spin polarized configurations used in the fit .    since the considered quantities are fitted for several configurations atomic transferability is already built in to these new pseudopotentials by construction .",
    "the core charge is represented by a single gaussian which is optimal for numerical efficiency .",
    "it is initialized such that it approximates well the physical core charge density and it is held fixed during an initial stage of the fit . then both the amplitude and the width of the gaussian are released and considered as fitting parameters . as a consequence",
    "the total amount of core charge and the width can differ from the physical value .    the parameters of the core charge constitute thus a small set of only two additional degrees of freedom .",
    "yet this allows to optimally reproduce atomic polarization energies without degrading the transferability and accuracy of other atomic properties .",
    "it was found that the inclusion of a more complicated core charge is not beneficial .",
    "furthermore , it should be emphasized that the novel nlcc pseudopotentials are not harder than their hgh counterparts .",
    "the smoothness of the core charge seems to play an important role for the fact that the hardness is not affected , and roughly the same grid spacings or energy cutoffs can be employed as for conventional hgh pseudopotentials . in particular , pseudopotentials with nlcc were generated for boron , carbon , nitrogen , oxygen , fluorine , aluminium , silicon , phosphorous , sulfur and chlorine . very weak spin dependences are expected for the rare gasses , and for all remaining chemical elements up to the third row , nlcc are found to be unnecessary , as hgh pseudopotentials are available that either include semicores ( sodium and magnesium ) or leave no core states at all ( hydrogen , lithium and beryllium ) .",
    "for the special case of hydrogen , it was found that the multi configuration fit gave slightly improved results even though obviously no core charge was added . since the focus of this paper is on systems made out of light elements , no relativistic effects such as spin - orbit coupling",
    "were included in the pseudopotentials .",
    "to assess the accuracy of the new pseudopotentials extensive calculations were performed for different test sets .",
    "the accuracy of covalent bond formation energies was examined for the standard g2 - 1 test set  @xcite . for the assessment of the accuracy of non - bonded interactions the s22  @xcite test set was used . to check the performance for materials under high pressure we chose carbon , silicon , silicon carbide and boron nitride as test systems .",
    "all pseudopotential calculations were done with the bigdft package  @xcite .",
    "the bigdft code uses a systematic wavelet basis set which allows to obtain the exact density functional solution with arbitrarily small error bounds .",
    "the parameter were set such that an accuracy of at least @xmath9 hartree was obtained .",
    "the libxc library  @xcite is used within bigdft for the evaluation of the exchange correlation functional .",
    "semi - empirical van - der waals corrections were added in bigdft according to the dft - d2@xcite and dft - d3@xcite methods for the calculations of the s22 test set .    to obtain reliable all - electron reference values for the atomization energies of the g2 - 1 test set , we performed all - electron calculations with the nwchem software package  @xcite using one of the largest available gaussian type basis sets , namely an augmented correlation consistent polarized valence quintuple zeta gaussian type basis set ( aug - cc - pv5z ) .",
    "care was taken to disable symmetry detection and to check for the lowest energy spin multiplicity .",
    "for the chemical elements li , be na and mg , the aug - cc - pv5z set was not available , so the corresponding quadruple zeta set ( aug - cc - pvqz ) was used to compute the atomization energies of @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 . to obtain the atomization energies of the relaxed molecules ,",
    "geometry optimizations were carried out using the very same basis set .",
    "atomic all - electron calculations of the spin polarization energies were done with our non - spherical atomic code , which expresses the wavefunctions as a product of spherical harmonics and radial functions .",
    "the radial function are given numerically on a logarithmic grid .",
    "the settings were chosen such that a precision of at least @xmath18 hartree can be obtained for the total energy .",
    "this required angular integration grids of 232 points and multipole representations up to @xmath19 .",
    "the atomic lsda reference energies from the national centre of science and technology ( nist)@xcite where reproduced within the given precision for all elements considered .",
    "we calculated the atomization energies also with the three different sets of paw  @xcite potentials available in vasp  @xcite .",
    "those paw potentials are derived from the all - electron atomic hamiltonian and aim at all - electron accuracy . in order to obtain the required high precision some parameters had to be set to tighter values than the default values .",
    "we had to use for the general accuracy ( prec = high accurate and lasph = true ) to activate nonspherical gradient corrections inside the paw spheres .",
    "it was carefully checked that the calculations were converged with respect to the size of the periodic simulation cell .",
    "furthermore , care was taken that the correct spin multiplicity and non - fractional occupations were produced .",
    "hard paw potentials were available for all required elements except for li , be , na and mg , for which semicore potentials were used instead . for comparison , all energies were recomputed with a set of default potentials .",
    "the third set consists of soft potentials for the elements b , c , n , o and f and default potentials otherwise . for the periodic solids , all - electron calculations",
    "have been performed using the full - potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) and augmented plane wave plus local orbitals ( apw + lo ) methods as implemented in the wien2k@xcite software package .",
    "we used a reduced muffin - tin radii for all atomic sorts in order to avoid their overlap up to the highest studied pressures .",
    "the sphere radii were kept fixed throughout the whole set of lattice parameters to obtain the best possible error cancellation .",
    "semicore states were treated as valence , because high compressions can lead to an overlap of their wavefunctions , which will give a contribution to the energy . inside the spheres ,",
    "the partial waves were expanded up to lmax = 10 .",
    "the number of plane waves was limited by a cutoff parameter rmtkmax = 9.0 for all the compounds under consideration .",
    "the charge density was fourier expanded with gmax = 14 a.u . for the majority of the systems we used a very dense k - points grid ( 15@xmath2015@xmath2015 ) to ensure total energy convergence .",
    "all the calculations were done at zero electronic temperature , i.e. no fermi smearing was used .",
    "zero point energies were not included in any of our results .",
    "atomization energies are frequently used to assess the quality of various exchange correlation functionals as well as other approximations used in electronic structure calculations .",
    "the gaussian g2 - 1 test set  @xcite is a standard benchmark set of 55 molecules in this context . since this test set does not contain molecules with the chemical elements b , al and mg we added the molecules bh , bh2 , alh , alh2 , mg2 und mgh .",
    "we used this augmented test set to compare our pseudopotential results with all - electron calculations .",
    "because of hund s rule most isolated atoms are strongly spin polarized . when an atom is inserted into a molecule or solid ,",
    "its spin polarization is typically strongly reduced . since",
    "standard pseudopotentials are based on a non - spin polarized reference configuration they can typically better describe atoms in molecules or solids than isolated atoms themselves . since the atomization energy is the difference between the total energy of the molecule and the sum of the total energies of its constituent isolated atoms , the largest contribution to the error in the atomization energy of a pseudopotential calculation comes actually from the atomic energies .",
    "accuracy of pbe  @xcite atomization energies computed with hgh pseudopotentials .",
    "explanations are in the text . ]",
    "the atomization energies of the molecules in the g2 - 1 test set were first computed using conventional hgh pseudopotentials  @xcite for the pbe exchange correlation functional . a comparison with all - electron data",
    "is shown in figure [ hgh ] .",
    "the spin multiplicity of systems with a net magnetic moment are indicated in brackets and omitted for closed shell systems .",
    "deviations of @xmath21 kcal / mol are indicated with a ( green ) shading to relate the errors to the requirements for chemical accuracy .",
    "it is found that the direct computation of the electronic atomization energies with the conventional pseudopotentials leads to significant disagreement with the results obtained in an all - electron calculation .",
    "an rather high mean absolute deviation ( mad ) of 6.83 kcal / mol to the electron reference values for all 55 molecules in the g2 - 1 set is found .",
    "however , the main contribution to the error in the atomization energies comes from the estimation of the energy of the isolated atoms .",
    "therefore , the atomization energies can be improved significantly by a two step procedure where the atomization energies are calculated as a sum of two terms .",
    "the first term is the energy difference between the molecule and the sum of the total energies of isolated , spherical and non - spinpolarized atoms .",
    "it thus can be considered as the atomization energy with respect to a set of non - physical atoms .",
    "this energy difference is calculated with the hgh pseudopotentials and is fairly accurate since no strong spin polarizations are involved .",
    "the second term is the difference in total energy between the real , i.e non - spherical and spin polarized , atom and the previously defined non - physical atom .",
    "this second term is calculated with our all - electron program for non - spherically symmetric atoms and is therefore exact .",
    "since the atomic spin polarization energies and energy terms for breaking the spherical symmetry are only a property of the atoms they can be considered as a set of atomic correction terms for the accurate calculation of atomization energies .",
