    "we shall analyse the genome sequences from the point of view of data compression in order to exploit a linguistic analysis .",
    "as the context suggests , the genomes are interpreted as symbol sequences of finite length , drawn by an information source ( the nature ) that remains mainly unknown and emits symbols taken from the alphabet of the four nucleotides @xmath0 .",
    "each genome identifies a living organism and we assume that it may be considered as the unique realisation produced by the source relative to that organism .",
    "we shall not give here a formal definition of information source .",
    "intuitively , it is a device emitting a sequence of symbols @xmath1 where each @xmath2 is an element of a finite alphabet @xmath3 .",
    "the rigorous definition @xcite lies on the notion of sequence space @xmath4 , that is the space of one - sided infinite sequences ( also called strings ) @xmath5 whose symbols are drawn from the alphabet .",
    "even if an information source is rigorously defined as a stochastic process @xmath6 acting on a sequence space , we may consider the symbolic source @xmath7 as the subset of the sequence space containing all the realizations of the process @xmath8 .",
    "this shall motivate the use of the term information source when referring to a sequence space .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath9 the set of finite symbolic sequences on the alphabet @xmath10 . if @xmath11 its length will be denoted by @xmath12 .",
    "dna sequences are special quaternary symbol sequences . as only a small fraction of dna nucleotides results in a viable organism ,",
    "the sequences belonging to a living organism are expected to be nonrandom and have some constraints . therefore , dna sequences should be compressible , at least locally .    in our approach to symbol sequences ,",
    "the crucial notion is the _",
    "information content_. given a finite string @xmath13 in @xmath9 , the meaning of _ quantity of information _",
    "@xmath14 contained in @xmath13 has the following natural connotation :    @xmath14 _ is the length of the smallest binary message from which you can reconstruct _ @xmath13 .    in his pioneering work , shannon defined the quantity of information as a statistical notion using the tools of probability theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "thus in shannon framework , the quantity of information which is contained in a string depends on its context .",
    "for example the string @xmath15 contains a certain information when it is considered as a string coming from the english language .",
    "the same string @xmath15 contains much less shannon information when it is considered as a string coming from the italian language because it is more frequent in the italian language ( in italian it means  bread  and , of course , it is very frequent ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "the shannon information of a string is the absolute value of the logarithm of the probability of its occurrence .",
    "however , there are measures of information which depend intrinsically on the string and not on its probability within a given context .",
    "we will adopt this point of view .",
    "an example of these measures of information is the algorithmic information content ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "we will not formally define it ( see @xcite and @xcite for rigorous definitions and properties ) .",
    "we limit ourselves to give an intuitive idea which is very close to the formal definition .",
    "we can consider a partial recursive function as a computer @xmath17 which takes a program @xmath18 ( namely a binary string ) as an input , performs some computations and gives a string @xmath19 , written in the given alphabet , as an output .",
    "the @xmath16 of a string @xmath13 is defined as the length of the shortest binary program @xmath18 which gives @xmath13 as its output , namely @xmath20 where @xmath21 means the length in bit of the string which the program @xmath18 consists of . a theorem due to a. n. kolmogorov ( @xcite ) implies that the information content @xmath22 of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath17 depends only on @xmath13 up to a fixed constant , therefore its asymptotic behaviour does not depend on the choice of @xmath17 .",
    "the shortest program @xmath18 which outputs the string @xmath13 is a sort of optimal encoding of @xmath13 .",
    "the information that is necessary to reconstruct the string is contained in the program .",
    "unfortunately , this coding procedure can not be performed by any algorithm .",
    "this is a very deep statement and , in some sense , it is equivalent to the turing halting problem or to the gdel incompleteness theorem",
    ". then the algorithmic information content is not computable by any algorithm .",
    "our method is focused on another measure : the information content of a finite string can also be defined by a lossless data compression algorithm @xmath23 ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this turns out to be a computable information content ( cic ) . in reference",
    "@xcite quantitative relations among shannon entropy of the source , the aic and the cic of sequences are provided .",
    "the `` classical '' studies in compression algorithms answer the question about the compressibility of dna with the additional advantage of using compression techniques to capture the properties of dna .",
    "it is known that dna sequences have two linguistic characteristic structures : _ reverse complements _ and _ approximate repeats_. the reverse complement @xmath24 of a sequence @xmath25 is a sequence such that each symbol of @xmath25 is replaced in @xmath26 by its complement one . that is , reading the reverse complement of a subsequence from a single strand of dna is the same as reading the corresponding complementary subsequence in the other strand .",
    "the approximate repeats are repeats that contain errors .",
    "approximate repeats are due to the local variability that is a common feature within genomes .",
    "there have been developed several special - purpose compression algorithms for dna sequences ( for instance , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "these algorithms are called dna - oriented because they use the aforementioned charateristic structures of genomes together with a sort of statistical compression to achieve a compression ratio lower than two bits per symbol .",
    "this is a great improvement since the standard text compression algorithms such as _ compress _ or _ gzip _ can not compress dna sequences but only expand the file with more than two bits per symbol .",
    "the reason for text compression to fail on dna sequences is that the regularities in genomes are much more subtler than in english texts , for which those algorithms have been designed .",
    "our analysis makes reference to a different approach .",
    "we aim at using the compression algorithm castore , which has been created without any biological purpose and _ a priori _ linguistic knowledge , to understand whether there exist low information regions within a genome , whether they have a functional type in common , whether they are extended or have short length and what kind of growth the information content shows in those regions .",
    "finally , as the algorithm castore belongs to the class of algorithms that adaptively create a dictionary relative to a parsing of the input sequence , we shall study dictionaries after compression , in order to investigate the relations between patterns and biological functions .",
    "a lossless data compression algorithm is any injective function @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , a compression algorithm is a reversible coding such that from the original string @xmath13 may be recovered from the encoded string @xmath28 .",
    "since the coded string contains all the information that is necessary to reconstruct and describe the structural features of the original string , we can consider the length of the coded string as an approximate measure of the quantity of information that is contained in the original string .",
    "the information content of a finite string @xmath29 with respect to a compression algorithm @xmath23 is defined as @xmath30 the cic of a string @xmath13 is the length ( in bit units ) of the coded string @xmath28 .",
    "the advantage of using a compression algorithm lies in the fact that the information content @xmath31 is a computable function over the space of finite strings . for this reason we named it computable information content .",
    "moreover , we define another quantity , the complexity of a finite sequence , providing an estimate for the rate of information content contained in it .",
    "the complexity of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath23 is the compression ratio @xmath32    under suitable optimality assumptions on the compression algorithm @xmath23 , we can extend this definition to infinite symbolic sequences belonging to @xmath4 and asympotically obtain the shannon entropy of the information source from which the sequence has been drawn ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the theoretical work has been extended also to trajectories coming from general dynamical systems and it is supported by application to several complex systems , as to turbulent or intermittent regimes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) and to weakly chaotic dynamical systems ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "let us describe the sort of linguistic analysis we shall perform on genetic sequences .",
    "we shall use the cic method to extract the functional regions whose information content is low and its growth is sublinear .",
    "we aim at understanding whether those regions show peculiar features such as specific highly repeated patterns of nucleotides ( they are usually called _ motifs _ ) .",
    "finally , we shall scan other genomes , both coming from the same domain of life and from different domains , looking for the presence of low information regions and comparing the motifs to each other .",
    "these regions are called _ atypical _ , as surprisingly they are highly compressible in comparison with the other regions .",
    "the dictionaries of some atypical regions will be studied and related to some known biological functions ( e.g. being a promoter region ) .",
    "finally , a preliminar result on potential application of this method to gene finding will be introduced .",
    "we have created and implemented a particular compression algorithm we called castore which is a modification of the lempel - ziv compression schemes @xmath33 and @xmath34 ( @xcite , @xcite ) and it has been introduced and studied in references @xcite and @xcite .",
    "its theoretical advantages with respect to lz78 showed that this algorithm is a sensitive measure of the information content of low entropy sequences .",
    "this is the reason that motivates the choice of the acronym * castore * to name the new algorithm : its meaning is * * c**ompression * * a**lgorithm , * * s**ensitive * to * * * re**gularity . as it has been proved in @xcite , the information content @xmath35 of a constant sequence @xmath36 , originally with length @xmath37 , is @xmath38 $ ] , if the algorithm @xmath23 is castore .",
    "the theory predicts that the best possible information content for a constant sequence of length @xmath37 is @xmath39constant .",
    "it may be shown that the algorithm @xmath34 encodes a constant @xmath37-digits long sequence to a string with length about @xmath40 bits ; so , we can not expect that @xmath34 is able to distinguish a sequence whose information content grows like @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) from a constant or periodic string .",
    "furthermore , the running time of castore is also sensibly shorter than that of @xmath33 ( with infinite window ) , then any implementation is more efficient .",
    "these are the main reasons that motivate the choice of using castore also for numerical experiments .",
    "now we briefly describe the internal running of castore .    as the ziv - lempel schemes ,",
    "the algorithm castore is based on an adaptive dictionary ( @xcite ) .",
    "one of the basic differences in the coding procedure is that the algorithm @xmath33 splits the input strings in overlapping phrases , while the algorithm castore ( as well as the algorithm @xmath34 ) parses the input string in non - overlapping phrases .",
    "moreover , castore differs from @xmath34 because the new phrase is a pair of two already parsed phrases , while @xmath34 couples one already parsed phrase and one symbol from the alphabet .    at the beginning of encoding procedure",
    ", the dictionary contains only the alphabet . in order to explain the main rules of the encoding ,",
    "let us consider a step @xmath43 within the encoding process , when the dictionary already contains @xmath43 phrases @xmath44 .",
    "the new phrase is defined as a pair ( _ prefix pointer_,_suffix pointer _ ) .",
    "the two pointers are referred to two ( not necessarily different ) phrases @xmath45 and @xmath46 chosen among the ones contained in the current dictionary as follows .",
    "first , the algorithm reads the input stream starting from the current position of the front end , looking for the longest phrase @xmath45 matching the stream .",
    "then , the algorithm looks for the longest phrase @xmath46 such that the joint word @xmath47 matches the stream .",
    "the new phrase @xmath48 that will be added to the dictionary is then @xmath49 .",
    "the output file contains an ordered sequence of the binary encoding of the pairs @xmath50 such that @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the dictionary index numbers corresponding to the prefix word @xmath53 and to the suffix word @xmath46 , respectively .",
    "the pair @xmath50 is referred to the new encoded phrase @xmath48 and has its own index number @xmath54 .      the following example shows how the algorithm castore encodes the input stream @xmath55    let the source alphabet be @xmath56 .",
    "the output file corresponds to the binary encoding of the following pairs contained in the second column .",
    "the first column is the dictionary index number of the encoded phrase in the dictionary which is showed in the same line , second column .",
    "for an easier reading , we add a third column which shows each encoded phrase in the original stream @xmath57 , but which is not contained in the output file : @xmath58 \\\\    2 & ( 0,\\ ^{\\prime}b\\ ^{\\prime}\\ ) & [ b ] \\\\    3 & ( 0,\\ ^{\\prime}c\\ ^{\\prime}\\ ) & [ c ] \\\\    & \\mbox{then , the encoding procedure starts}&\\\\ 4 & ( 1,2 ) & [ ab ] \\\\    5 & ( 3,4 ) & [ cab ] \\\\    6 & ( 4,3 ) & [ abc]\\\\ 7 & ( 5,3 ) & [ cabc ] \\end{array}\\ ] ] and so on .",
    "the dictionary built by the algorithm castore is an ordered collection of phrases , that is , of pairs of words .",
    "thus , a phrase is composed by a prefix - word and a suffix - word . by construction , phrases are different from each other , since the algorithm exploits a parsing on the input string .",
    "furthermore , each phrase may become a word , if it appears as prefix or suffix of other phrases in the following dictionary .    in the following",
    ", we shall look at the most frequent words , at the longest phrases and in some cases we shall compare the results to the same analysis performed by means of the algorithm @xmath33 and exploited in collaboration with a group of physicists from the university of rome ( see their previous work @xcite by v. loreto et al . for details on the methodology ) .",
    "we shall show that recurrent subsequences occur especially along the regions with lowest information content .",
    "notice that we refer to exact repeats .",
    "we shall distinguish among recurrent subsequences either * motifs * or * patterns*. a _ motif _ is a recurrent word in the dictionary , whereas a _ pattern _ is a recurrent subsequence that does not match any word of the dictionary , but is contained in some of them .",
    "if a motif is found , we shall follow its _ descent _ , that is the set of phrases whose the motif is either a prefix or a suffix or both .",
    "moreover , we shall search for the motif to be a * sliding pattern * , in the sense that it is contained in other phrases without being their prefix nor their suffix . furthermore",
    ", if only a sliding pattern is to be found , then we shall recover its * root * , that is the longest word of the dictionary matching part of the pattern .",
    "we have analysed the computable complexity of 12 complete genomes of some archaea , bacteria and eukaryotes , together with chromosomes ii and iv of _ arabidopsis thaliana_. the complete list is shown on the following table [ cssh1 ] .    in order to take into account the biological functional constraints actually existing among the bases within the genome and to highlight new features of coding and noncoding regions , we have exploited a _",
    "fragment analysis_.    we say that any exon , intron or intergenic region is a functional _ fragment _ of the genome sequence , following the prediction as it has been identified via biological databases and statistical tools ( @xcite )",
    ".    * notation . * in prokariotic genomes",
    "there are two functional types , therefore we shall denote by @xmath59 and @xmath60 the coding and the noncoding fragments , respectively , where @xmath61 is an index to order fragments .",
    "in eukaryotic genomes there are three different types of regions : we shall denote by @xmath62 the coding fragments and by @xmath63 and @xmath60 the noncoding intragenic fragments and the noncoding integenic fragments , respectively .",
    "thus , we shall consider the computable complexity @xmath64 of each fragment and study the information content growth @xmath65 within a fragment .",
    "first , we have considered how the information content varies along some complete dna sequences : that is , we have studied the behaviour of the cic of a genome as a function of the number of encoded symbols . as a result ,",
    "we remark that the function @xmath66 grows linearly for all the complete genomes @xmath25 we have analysed and the asymptotic slope is the value of their computable complexity @xmath67 : @xmath68 where @xmath69 indicates the first @xmath37 bases in the complete genome @xmath25 . however , we can enhance some regions of the genome and we will see that the @xmath70-line is locally no more straight .",
    "this characteristic feature is shared by all the genomes we have analysed , both prokaryotes and eukaryotes and confirms the intuitive idea that the information content growth should be slower in the parts of the genome where some regularity prevails .",
    "[ cols= \" < , > \" , ]     the atypical region @xmath71 was a challenging task , because not only the information content growth shows an abrupt change around @xmath72 bp ( figure [ arabgene ] @xmath73 ) , but also the word length is subjected to a deep decrease when reaching that threshold , although at that point the dictionary already contained more than @xmath74 phrases , most of them longer than 50 bp ( figure [ arabgene ] @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) .",
    "it was this twofold look of the region that suggested that in the final part of this region ( from @xmath72 bp to @xmath77 bp ) there might have been some coding sequences .",
    "this was also supported by the prevailing length of about @xmath78 bp , which , as it was already pointed out , may be considered as characteristic of coding regions .    as a result , four putative genes g1 , g2 , g3 and g4 have been located by means of hidden markov model - based program fgenesh that has been created for predicting multiple genes and their structure in genomic dna sequences .",
    "the analysis via fgenesh has been exploited with respect to known genes in _",
    "arabidopsis thaliana_. their predicted position is illustrated in figure [ cfrarabgene ] .",
    "we have shown that complete genomes may be analysed in some of their distinctive features by means of the computable information content obtained via compression algorithms .",
    "the information content may be used to extract regions having an atypical information growth , which is strictly connected to the presence of highly repetitive subregions that might be supposed to have a regulatory function within the genome .",
    "different types of sublinearities have been associated to different biogical features .",
    "these results shall pave the way for a more profound understanding of the local compressibility of genomes and for a more detailed identification of motifs and patterns that are significant to some biological function , in view of a joint use together with other predictive methods .",
