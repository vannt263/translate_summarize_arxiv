    "watersheds are the lines separating adjacent drainage basins ( catchments ) .",
    "they play a fundamental role in water management  @xcite , landslides @xcite , and flood prevention @xcite .",
    "natural watersheds are fractal @xcite .",
    "geographers and geomorphologists have found the evolution of watersheds to be driven by local events classified as stream captures or drainage rearrangements.these events can affect the biogeography @xcite , and may occur due to various mechanisms like erosion @xcite , natural damming @xcite , tectonic motion @xcite , as well as volcanic activity @xcite .",
    "fractality of watersheds was first claimed in ref",
    "their observations were limited to small scales and only few samples . in ref .",
    "@xcite , extensive numerical simulations were devised to study watersheds on uncorrelated artificial landscapes , as well as on large - scale natural landscapes in the form of digital elevation maps ( dem ) , as the ones obtained from satellite imagery @xcite . defining the watershed to be the line dividing the entire landscape into two parts , a novel and efficient identification algorithm was developed . using this method ,",
    "the self - similarity was confirmed and the fractal dimension was estimated to be @xmath1 for the alps , @xmath2 for the himalayas , and @xmath3 for uncorrelated artificial landscapes . due to the ubiquity of the obtained fractal dimension , also relations to other physical models",
    "have been proposed , such as optimal paths and optimal path cracks @xcite , bridge percolation @xcite , and the surface of explosive percolation clusters @xcite .",
    "this opens a broad range of possible implications and applications of the properties of watersheds . in this paper",
    ", we study the effect of correlations on the fractal dimension of watersheds for artificial landscapes and compare in two dimensions to the values obtained for several natural landscapes ranging from flat ( big lakes ) to mountainous regions ( rocky mountains ) .",
    "the mechanisms triggering the stream capture and drainage rearrangement events @xcite , although diverse , are all modifications of the topography . in that perspective ,",
    "fehr _ et al . _",
    "@xcite investigated the effect of such events by applying small local perturbations to natural and artificial landscapes and found that watersheds can be strongly affected .",
    "power - law scaling behavior was observed , e.g. for the distribution of the area enclosed by the original and the displaced watershed , and shown to be independent on the strength of the perturbation .",
    "tuning the correlation degree in the artificial landscapes , the values of the exponents were matched with the ones obtained for natural landscapes .",
    "additionally , for uncorrelated artificial landscapes , relations for the scaling laws to properties of invasion percolation @xcite were conjectured .",
    "we now extend these studies to three dimensional systems , where the watershed is a surface dividing the volume into two parts .",
    "we focus mainly on the study of conjectured scaling relations , analyze the finite - size effects , and clarify the relation to invasion percolation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secfrac ]",
    "we briefly revisit the definition of our model and show the dependence of the fractal dimension on the landscape correlations for both two and three dimensions .",
    "section  [ sec2dpert ] summarizes our results for the power - law distributions found for the effects of topographical modifications @xcite . to validate the relations conjectured for two dimensions",
    ", we study in section  [ sec3dpert ] the effect of perturbations for three dimensional systems .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section  [ secconclusion ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     although the volumes @xmath4 are still compact , we find @xmath5 by an analysis of @xmath6 and @xmath7 similar to the one performed in two dimensions using eq .",
    "( [ eqarpredict ] ) in the limit @xmath8 .",
    "the obtained value of @xmath9 is close to the fractal dimension of the watershed , what suggests that the mass of the changed volume is dominated by its surface , in contrast to what we observe in two dimensions .",
    "this is also confirmed by a box counting analysis of the largest of all changed volumes , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ figboxsingle ] .    in agreement with the findings by lee in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the size distribution of sub - critical point - to - point invasion percolation , as introduced by arajo _",
    "@xcite , is independent on the dimensionality of the system , we obtain @xmath10 for uncorrelated systems , similar to the value found in two dimensions .",
    "this confirms the relation to invasion percolation drawn in ref .",
    "@xcite . inserting the estimates of @xmath11 , and @xmath12 , given in tab .",
    "[ tab_exp ] , into eq .",
    "( [ eq_alpharel ] ) , we find @xmath13 matching with the value @xmath14 obtained numerically , hence validating the conjectured relation .",
    "similarly , we also observe that our results are consistent with eq .",
    "( [ eq_betarel ] ) .",
    "the dependence of the exponents @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 on the hurst exponent @xmath18 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3d_exp ] , confirming the relation @xmath19 ( eq .  ( [ eq_rhorel ] ) ) , independent on the degree of correlations .",
    "we observe @xmath15 to decrease for @xmath20 and to approach @xmath16 , similar as found in two dimensions ( compare section  [ sec2dpert ] ) .",
    "in summary , we were able to show that watersheds are fractals with a fractal dimension in the range of @xmath21 for all analyzed natural landscapes from mountainous ( e.g. alps ) to rather flat ones ( e.g. big lakes ) . by studying model landscapes with long - range correlations characterized by the hurst exponent @xmath18 , we determined the dependence of the fractal dimension on @xmath18 in both two and three dimensions , where for the former we found good quantitative agreement with natural landscapes , for which @xmath22 . extending the work done in ref .",
    "@xcite on the impact of perturbations on watersheds in two dimensional systems , we found the lower and upper bounds of the distribution of areas to scale with distance and system size with an exponent @xmath23 in two and @xmath5 in three dimensions . considering these cutoffs",
    ", we were able to derive a function describing the average area , which includes the finite - size effects . in a similar way , by integrating @xmath24 , we obtained a function for the average mass @xmath25 of the invasion percolation cluster . in the extension of the perturbation study to three dimensional systems , we observed the changed volumes to be dominated by their surface , i.e. , the watershed , resulting in a value of @xmath9 close to the fractal dimension of the watershed itself .",
    "the distributions and averages for the three dimensional case are shown to follow power laws as in two dimensions .",
    "indeed , we found in the uncorrelated case an intrinsic relation to invasion percolation . finally , our results in three dimensions are consistent with the conjectured relations between the exponents . as a followup of the work presented here , it would be interesting to see how the impact of perturbations could be related to other physical models , such as optimal path cracks @xcite , bridge percolation @xcite , and the surface of explosive percolation clusters @xcite .",
