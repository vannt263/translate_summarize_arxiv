    "rna plays an important rule in the biochemistry of all living systems  @xcite . similar to the dna , it is a linear chain - molecule build from four types of bases , i.e.,adenine ( a ) , cytosine ( c ) , guanine ( g ) , and uracil ( u )",
    ". it does not only transmit pure genetic information , but , e.g.,works as a catalyst . while for the former the primary structure , i.e.,the sequence of the bases , is relevant , for the later the kind of higher order structures , i.e.,secondary and tertiary structures , are relevant .",
    "like in the double helix of the dna , in rna complementary bases can build hydrogen bonds between each other .",
    "compared to dna , where the bonds are built between two different strands , rna builds bonds between bases of the same rna strand .",
    "the information , which bases of the strand are paired , gives the secondary structure , and the spatial structure is called the tertiary structure .",
    "the tertiary structure is stabilized by a much weaker interaction than the secondary structure .",
    "this leads to a separation of energy scales between secondary and tertiary structure , and gives the justification to neglect the later  @xcite .",
    "therefore we deal here with the secondary structure only .",
    "one crucial point in calculating the secondary structure is the used energy model : on the one hand , if one aims to get minimum structures close to the experimentally observed one , one uses energy models that take into account structure elements  @xcite , e.g.,hair pin loops . on the other hand ,",
    "if one is interested in the qualitative behaviour , one uses models as simple as possible that keep the general behaviour , e.g.,only one kind of base  @xcite or using energies depending only on the number and on the type of paired bases  @xcite .",
    "here we will consider only models with the later kind of interaction energy . in recent years",
    "several authors examined this kind of models with regard to the thermodynamic behaviour , i.e.,searching for phase transitions and describing the type of phase involved  @xcite ; liu and bundschuh  @xcite recently discussed , whether native rna is already in the regime of the thermodynamic limit or finite size effect have to be taken into account . in this paper",
    "we numerically investigate a hybrid model of two well known energy models @xcite , i.e.,a _ pair energy model _",
    ", where only base pairs are considered regardless of their neighbourhood , and a _ stacking energy model _ , where only consecutive paired bases , i.e.,forming a stack , gives an energy contribution .",
    "it has been claimed that the stacking energy is more relevant than just the pair energy in real rna @xcite .",
    "our model contains terms for _ both _ types of interactions and allows to move continuously from one model to the other .",
    "we are interested , whether the two limiting models are qualitatively different , in particular , whether a phase transition occurs , when moving from one model to the other .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section section [ sec : model ]",
    ", we define our model , i.e.,we formally define secondary structures and introduce our energy model . in section",
    "[ sec : algorithm ] , we explain how to calculate the partition function with a dynamic programming algorithm . in section [ sec : observables ] , we introduce the observables which we investigate in the following section [ sec : results ] . while in section [ sec : binder_cumulant ] and section [ sec : temperature_dependence ] we do finite temperature calculations , in section [ sec : epsilon_coupling ] we use the @xmath1-couplingmethod at zero temperature .",
    "because rna molecules are linear chains of bases , they can be described as a ( quenched ) sequence @xmath3 of bases @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the length of the sequence . within this single stranded molecule",
    "some bases can pair and build a secondary structure .",
    "typically watson - crick base pairs , i.e.,a - u and c - g have the strongest affinity to each other , they are also called complementary base pairs . each base can be paired at most once . for a given sequence @xmath6 of bases the secondary structure",
    "can be described by a set @xmath7 of pairs @xmath8 ( with the convention @xmath9 ) , meaning that bases @xmath10  and @xmath11 are paired . for convenience of notation",
    "we further define a matrix @xmath12 with @xmath13 if @xmath14 , and @xmath15 otherwise .",
    "two restriction are used : ( i ) here we exclude so called _ pseudo - knots _ , that means , for any @xmath16 , either @xmath17 or @xmath18 must hold , i.e.,we follow the notion of pseudo knots being more an element of the tertiary structure @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) between two paired bases a minimum distance is required : @xmath19 is required , granting some flexibility of the molecule ( here @xmath20 ) .",
    "every secondary structure @xmath21  is assigned a certain energy @xmath22 ; note that this energy in general depends on the @xmath23  as well , so it is more precisely to write @xmath24 , but we assume that the structure also includes the information about the sequence . with such an energy model",
    "it is possible to calculate the canonical partition function @xmath25 of a given sequence @xmath23  by summing over all possible structures @xmath26 , but it is computationally more efficient to compute it by using the partition functions of the subsequences , i.e.,by a dynamic programming approach .",
    "motivated by the observation that the secondary structure is due to building of numerous base pairs where every pair of bases is bound by hydrogen bonds , one assigns each pair @xmath8 a certain energy @xmath27 depending only on the kind of bases .",
    "the total energy is the sum over all pairs @xmath28 e.g.,by choosing @xmath29 for non - complementary bases @xmath30 , @xmath31 pairings of this kind are suppressed .",
    "another possible model is to assign an energy @xmath32  to a pair @xmath14 iff also @xmath33 .",
    "this _ stacking energy _ can be motivated by the fact that a single pairing gives some gain in the binding energy , but also reduces the entropy of the molecule , because through this additional binding it looses some flexibility .",
    "formally the total energy of a structure can be written as @xmath34 assuming that for every pair @xmath35 the bases @xmath10  and @xmath36 are complementary bases .",
    "the total number @xmath37  of consecutive base pairs is called the _ stacking size_. single base pairs are not considered as stacks , therefore @xmath38 for any stack .",
    "both types of energy models are discussed in the literature  @xcite , but , to our knowledge , so far no one has discussed a hybrid model .",
    "we examine the sum of both models at once . @xmath39 where the parameters @xmath32  and @xmath40 can be adjusted freely , including both models discussed above . here",
    "we use @xmath41 with a pair energy @xmath42 independent of the kind of bases .    due to the simple structure of the energy model , e.g.,the energies depend not on the position of the bases within the sequence or whether the paired bases include some structure elements like hairpins , the ground state is highly degenerated  @xcite .      due to the fact that pseudo knots are excluded from our model ( see section [ sec : energy_models ] ) , the calculation of the partition function can be done recursively . the algorithm is similar to that of nussinov  @xcite . the algorithms calculates the elements of two upper - triangular matrices @xmath43 and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the partition function of the subsequence from base @xmath10  to @xmath36 under the boundary condition that bases @xmath46 and @xmath47 are not paired , and @xmath48 the partition function under the boundary condition that bases @xmath46 and @xmath47 are complementary ; @xmath48 is only used as an auxiliary matrix . then @xmath49 can be computed from the partition functions @xmath25  and @xmath50  of smaller subsequences in the following way ( remember that @xmath51 denotes the minimum distance between two bases of a pair ) @xmath52 which is schematically explained in fig .",
    "[ fig : partition_function ] .    , gray boxes @xmath50 . ]",
    "because both matrices depend on each other , they must be calculated simultaneously , starting along the diagonal and continuing along the off - diagonals .",
    "the calculation of the partition function can be done in @xmath53 steps , where @xmath5 is the length of the sequence .",
    "the partition function @xmath25 of the entire sequence is @xmath54 , but also the other matrix elements are useful for generating ensembles of structures according to the boltzmann distribution ( see section [ sec : observables ] ) .    a similar algorithm can be used to calculate the ground state energy : @xmath55 in comparison to eq .",
    "additions are replace by @xmath56-operations , multiplications by additions and the exponentials of the energies by the energies them self .",
    "after calculating the partition function @xmath25  for a given random sequence , we want to measure some quantities to compare the members of the ensemble . in principle",
    "most quantities could be calculated by a similar dynamic programming algorithm introduced above , but in general the running time behaviour would be of higher order ( than three ) in the sequence length .",
    "for this reason we use a different method , where an ensemble of structures is generated due to its boltzmann weight  @xcite .",
    "the procedure to build a sequence is essentially a backtracking algorithm : starting with the entire sequence a partner for an outermost base , e.g.,base @xmath5 , is chosen with the appropriate probability , e.g.,base @xmath57 , after this the procedure is applied to the subsequences 1 to @xmath58 and @xmath59 to @xmath5 . if base @xmath5 is chosen not to be paired at all , one uses the sequence shortened by base @xmath5 . considering a subsequence from base @xmath57 to @xmath60 , the probability @xmath61 that bases @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 ) are paired is given by @xmath65 for each member of this ensemble @xmath66  the quantity of interest @xmath67 is calculated and the average @xmath68 is used as an approximation to the expectation value of the gibbs - boltzmann - ensemble ; for large enough ensembles @xmath66  this average approaches the true expectation value .",
    "a simple observable is the energy @xmath69 and its fluctuations @xmath70 , the later is directly connected with the specific heat @xmath71 .    of particular importance is the overlap @xmath72  between two structures @xmath7 and @xmath73 @xmath74 that is the number of bases paired to the same base in both structures normalized such that @xmath72  lies always between zero and one .",
    "this is a measure of how similar two structures are .",
    "note however , that with this definition the overlap of one structure with itself is @xmath75 unless all bases are paired , where it is equal to one .",
    "a definition of @xmath76 where also bases unpaired in both structures are counted is used in  @xcite resulting in an overlap definition that is normalized , however this similarity measurement has the drawback that the less bases are paired the more two structures get similar .",
    "we further remark that for any two structures @xmath21 , @xmath73 the cauchy - schwarz inequality @xmath77 holds . with this quantity @xmath72  two ensembles @xmath78 and @xmath79 can be compared , e.g.,looking at the distribution of @xmath80 of all @xmath81 .",
    "the ensemble averages @xmath82 in general depend on the chosen sequence , therefore a further averaging over several ( random ) sequences is required .",
    "this sequence average is denoted by @xmath83}}$ ] .",
    "we again approximate this average by summing over a finite set of sequences .",
    "because of this two stage averaging , it is probably preferable instead of looking at @xmath84}}$ ] directly to use functions of the first and higher moments of @xmath72 , e.g.,the binder cumulant @xcite , which is defined by @xmath85}}}{{\\ensuremath{\\left [ { \\ensuremath{\\left\\langle q^2\\right\\rangle}}^2\\right]}}}\\right)\\ ] ] where @xmath86 is either the average over all pairs of one ensemble @xmath87 or the average over all pairs of two ensembles @xmath88 the later choice is appropriate when one is looking for a change in the behaviour of the models when one varies the parameters in comparison to a reference model , while the former is the better choice , if an external parameter , e.g.,the temperature , is varied .",
    "the binder cumulant @xmath89  vanishes at high temperatures , while for low temperatures it approaches a finite value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "a similar quantity has been used in  @xcite : @xmath90}}-{\\ensuremath{\\left [ { \\chi_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{r}}}}}\\right]}}^2 }        { { \\ensuremath{\\left [ { \\chi_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{r}}}}}\\right]}}^2}\\\\ \\intertext{where } \\label{eq : qvariance } { \\chi_{{\\ensuremath{\\mathcal{r}}}}}&{:=}l\\,\\left({\\ensuremath{\\left\\langle { \\ensuremath{q}}^2\\right\\rangle}}-{\\ensuremath{\\left\\langle { \\ensuremath{q}}\\right\\rangle}}^2\\right)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is the variance of the @xmath76 distribution .",

    "<S> we calculate various thermodynamic quantities , both at zero temperature as well as at finite temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> all calculations can be done efficiently in polynomial time by a dynamic programming algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we do not find a sign for transition between the models , but the critical exponent @xmath0 of the correlation length , describing the phase transition in all models to an ordered low - temperature phase , seems to depend continuously on the model . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we apply the @xmath1-couplingmethod , to study low excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the exponent @xmath2 describing the energy - scaling of the excitations seems to depend not much on the energy model . </S>"
