    "quantum phase transition in strongly correlated electron systems which is the qualitative change in the ground state properties versus the a parameter in the hamiltonian ( a magnetic field , amount of disorder , @xmath3 ) have been at the focus of research recently @xcite . specially , field induced effects in the low dimensional quantum spin models have been attracting much interest from theoretical and experimental point of view in recent years @xcite .",
    "the magnetic properties of a system with axial anisotropy depends on the direction of the applied field . for instance , the magnetic properties of the antiferromagnetic one dimensional spin 1/2 xxz chain in the longitudinal field is quite different from the case of transverse field .",
    "the longitudinal field commutes with the rest of hamiltonian and preserves the integrability of the model by bethe ansatz while a transverse field does not commute and the model is no longer integrable .",
    "the transverse field induces the antiferromagnetic long range order in perpendicular direction to the field and causes a quantum phase transition to the paramagnetic phase at the critical point .",
    "experimental observations @xcite justify this effect in the quasi - one dimensional compound , cs@xmath4cocl@xmath5 .",
    "the qualitative change in the ground state at the quantum critical point ( qcp ) for zero temperature ( @xmath6 ) affects the finite temperature properties of the model close to the qcp .",
    "the quantum critical properties of the ising model in transverse field has been extensively studied with different approaches @xcite . however , there is no work on the finite temperature properties of the xxz model in the presence of a transverse field .",
    "it is our aim to study the thermodynamic behavior of the anisotropic heisenberg chain in a transverse field which is the model hamiltonian for the mentioned behavior .",
    "the hamiltonian for this system can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the exchange coupling , @xmath9 is the anisotropy in @xmath10-direction , @xmath11 is proportional to the transverse magnetic field and @xmath12 is the @xmath13-component of pauli matrices at site @xmath14 .",
    "experiments@xcite showed that cs@xmath4cocl@xmath5 is an realization of this model with @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 .",
    "we will shortly discuss the different approaches to finite temperature properties of the lattice model using lanczos method in the next section .",
    "we then implement an appropriate approach to get the thermodynamic properties of the xxz model in the transverse field . in this paper",
    ", we have studied the finite temperature properties of a chain with @xmath17 sites in magnetic fields @xmath18 and with anisotropies @xmath19 and @xmath16 .",
    "the lanczos diagonalization method is a powerful numerical tool to study the properties of the quantum many body systems on finite clusters .",
    "it is usually used to get the ground state of a quantum model with high accuracy . however",
    ", this technique can be extended to finite temperature @xcite , where one can study the energy spectrum of the system and its behavior under changing system parameters such as anisotropy and magnetic field .    in the lanczos algorithm",
    ", the ground state can be obtained with very high accuracy .",
    "however , to get finite temperature behavior we need to take average over the whole hilbert space ( @xmath20 ) with boltzmann weights , i.e.    @xmath21    it has been proposed that the lanczos procedure can be used to get reliable approximation for the finite temperature ( @xmath22 ) properties of the lattice models @xcite . in this approach",
    "the hilbert space is partially spanned by different random initial vectors for several lanczos procedures .",
    "this approach is called finite temperature lanczos method ( ftlm)@xcite which is based on the following equations .",
    "@xmath23 where @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) is the boltzmann constant and @xmath26 is the total number of random samples with different initial vectors @xmath27 .",
    "the eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues of the tridiagonal matrix are @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively for @xmath30 .",
    "the ftlm procedure works well for finite temperatures , however , it does not converge to the ground state expectation value ( @xmath31 ) as @xmath32 because of statistical fluctuations .",
    "i.e.    @xmath33    this problem can be solved by a symmetric algorithm which is explained below .      the low temperature lanczos method ( ltlm )",
    "was proposed as a symmetric algorithm to remedy failure of ftlm at low temperatures@xcite .",
    "however , ltlm needs more cpu time and memory but requires fewer steps in low temperatures @xcite .",
    "ltlm can be formulated similar to the case of fltm with the following equation , @xmath34 where the partition function ( @xmath35 ) is calculated in the same way as in eq .",
    "( [ ftlm ] ) .",
    "using this method , as @xmath32 we have ,    @xmath36    which is equal to the ground state expectation value .",
    "it is thus more accurate to get the low temperature quantum properties .",
    "we are interested in the finite temperature properties of the hamiltonian defined in eq .",
    "( [ xxztf ] ) and specially in the quantum critical behavior as @xmath32 .",
    "we have thus implemented the ltlm method to get the finite temperature properties which is accurate close to @xmath6 , although it consumes more cpu time and memory . to justify this ,",
    "we have plotted the @xmath37-component spin structure factor at momentum @xmath38 ( @xmath39 , see eq .",
    "( [ structurefactor ] ) ) versus @xmath40 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in this figure , we have shown both the ftlm and ltlm results for a chain of length @xmath41 together with the exact diagonalization ( ed ) results for comparison . the discrepancy of ftlm in low temperature ( @xmath42 ) in comparison with the ed results is clear specially for @xmath43 as discussed in previous section .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the ltlm results converge to the ed ones as @xmath32 and are in good agreement for higher temperatures .",
    "the data comes from the lanczos algorithm with random sampling using @xmath45 , @xmath46 ( to get 8 digits accuracy in the first excited state energy ) and for a chain of length @xmath17 with @xmath16 . for @xmath47",
    "the specific heat shows exponential decay as @xmath40 goes to zero .",
    "this is in agreement with the presence of a finite energy gap in this region .",
    "the model is gapless at @xmath48 , however , our data on a finite size does not show this behavior because of the finite size effects .",
    "the finite size effects also appear as some level crossing between the first excited state and the ground state in finite system which become degenerate ground state in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this level crossing causes small oscillations close to @xmath6 and for @xmath50 .",
    "the finite size analysis shows that the gap ( @xmath51 ) scales as @xmath52 where @xmath53 @xcite .",
    "it is the scaling behavior of the second excited state which becomes gapped in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "our data confirms the exponential decay of the specific heat for very low temperatures as @xmath50 .    however , the general feature @xmath54 which is the opening of energy gap due to breaking of rotational @xmath55 symmetry @xmath54 has been appeared as the exponential decay of specific heat at low temperatures .",
    "the exponential decay is vanishing as @xmath56 . at the critical point ( @xmath57 )",
    "the gap vanishes due to the presence of goldestone modes which destroy the long - range antiferromagnetic order in @xmath2-direction . for @xmath58",
    "the system enters the paramagnetic phase and the gap is proportional to the @xmath59 which is clearly shown in fig . [ fig2 ] .",
    "moreover , the density plot in fig . [ fig2 ] shows three different regions at finite temperature which are distinguished by different energy scales .",
    "( i ) the low temperature and @xmath50 where the classical domain walls quasi particles define the dynamic of system @xcite .",
    "( ii ) the quantum critical region where the dynamic is dictated by the quantum fluctuations which become long ranged as both the temporal and spatial correlation length diverge .",
    "( iii ) the low temperature and @xmath58 where the classical spin flipped quasi particles represent the dynamical behavior of the model .",
    "we would like here to comment on the finite size effects in our calculations .",
    "since the ltlm approach is based on several sampling in the hilbert space , the finite size effect will be weak and negligible for nonzero temperature .",
    "the size dependence of the specific heat is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) where different chains with @xmath62 have been considered .",
    "unless the height of specific heat which is not the same for different @xmath63 , in the low and high temperature regions all data fall on each other which justifies the weak finite size effect .",
    "we ignore the small size dependence and claim that the our data of the specific heat can be interpreted for a very large chain length .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) shows the small oscillations in very low temperature which is the result of level crossing where the ground state expectation is dominant in the partition function and will vanish as the chain size becomes large .",
    "a remark is in order here .",
    "the finite size effect is weak and is compensated by random sampling if the model is not close to a quantum critical point .",
    "this is the case of our data presented in fig .",
    "( [ fig3 ] ) at @xmath60 .",
    "however , close to quantum critical points a finite size analysis should be implemented to find the correct behavior .",
    "for instance , the level crossing of the first two excited states should be incorporated in a finite size treatment as done in ref .",
    "to find the scaling of energy gap .",
    "the situation is more complex to find the scaling behavior close to @xmath64 since the value of @xmath64 itself is obtained by a finite accuracy which is an extra source of error in determing the critical exponents .",
    "we have also calculated the specific heat of the xy chain , @xmath19 , which shows similar qualitative behavior to fig .",
    "it is in agreement with the quantum renormalization group results @xcite which states that the universality class of @xmath65 is the same as @xmath19 case .",
    "however , the critical field ( @xmath64 ) is slightly smaller for @xmath19 which is approximately , @xmath66 .",
    "we have calculated the static structure factor at finite temperature .",
    "the @xmath13-component spin structure factor at momentum @xmath67 is defined by @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the thermal average defined in eq .",
    "( [ ltlm ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian ( eq . ( [ xxztf ] ) ) is gapless at @xmath48 where there is no long range ordering in the ground state while the correlation functions decay algebraically , it is called spin fluid state .",
    "the transverse field ( @xmath72 ) breaks the u(1 ) rotational symmetry to a lower ising - like which develops a nonzero energy gap .",
    "the ground state then has long range antiferromagnetic order for @xmath73 .",
    "however , due to nonzero projection of the magnetization in the direction of the transverse field , it is a spin - flop phase .     versus temperature for different transverse field , @xmath16 and @xmath74 for cs@xmath4cocl@xmath5 .",
    "for @xmath50 the susceptibility diverges at finite temperature while for @xmath58 it only diverges at @xmath6.(color online),width=302 ]    the antiferromagnetic ordering in @xmath2-direction for the spin - flop phase implies that the @xmath2-component structure factor at @xmath70 diverges as the size of system goes to infinity .",
    "this can be seen as a peak in the structure factor .",
    "the density plot of @xmath75 is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) versus temperature ( @xmath40 ) and transverse field ( @xmath11 ) for @xmath16 .",
    "the negative peak in @xmath75 ( which is a signature of antiferromagnetic ordering ) is the dark ( blue ) area in fig .",
    "( [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "it shows that the ordering is absent at @xmath48 and will gradually appears for increasing @xmath11 .",
    "the antiferromagnetic ordering in @xmath2-direction can be represented by staggered magnetization in the same direction ( @xmath76 ) as the order parameter .",
    "fig.([fig4 ] ) shows that @xmath76 becomes maximum at @xmath77 .",
    "the point @xmath77 can also represent the position where the gap becomes maximum . further increasing the transverse field",
    "suppress the antiferromagnetic ordering until reaching the critical point @xmath57 .",
    "it is clearly shown in fig.([fig4 ] ) that @xmath76 becomes zero at @xmath57 .",
    "the density plot of x - component structure factor at @xmath71 has been presented in fig.([figc ] ) versus @xmath40 and @xmath11 .",
    "the value of @xmath78 is small for @xmath79 which implies low alignment of the spins in the direction of the external field .",
    "however , this value starts to grow for @xmath80 and obviously saturates for @xmath81 .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath78 is the signature of long range order in the field direction where the moments saturates at the maximum value in the paramagnetic phase .",
    "however , as the temperature increases the ordering will be washed out due to thermal fluctuations which destroy the long range order in one dimension .",
    "the long range order at finite temperature is meaningful in the sense of three dimensional model which is composed of weakly coupled chains .",
    "this will be explained in the next sections via the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "( temperature ) and @xmath11 ( magnetic field ) plane .",

    "it is a mean field approach where the one dimensional chain is treated exactly while the interactions between chains are weak and considered in a mean field approach . in the disordered phase the dynamical susceptibility of coupled chains at zero frequency is @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the one dimensional susceptibility in @xmath2-direction and momentum @xmath67 which comes from the ltlm computations .",
    "we have plotted @xmath87 versus temperature in fig .",
    "( [ fig5 ] ) for different transverse field .",
    "the susceptibility diverges at finite ( nonzero ) temperature for @xmath50 which shows the phase transition from the disordered phase to the antiferromagnetic long range ordered phase . for @xmath58 ,",
    "the susceptibility only diverges at @xmath6 which justifies no long range ordered at finite temperature .",
    "we have also used the rpa to calculate the inter - chain exchange coupling ( @xmath84 ) from our numerical computations and experimental data @xcite .",

    "the coupling between chains is two order of magnitude smaller than the intrachain interaction which verifies the rpa implemented here .",

    "it is argued that the symmetric algorithm @xcite ( ltlm ) is more accurate at low temperatures than the finite temperature lanczos method @xcite .",
    "we have found that the specific heat decays exponentially at low temperatures for @xmath50 which justifies the presence of finite energy gap in the lowest part of spectrum .",
    "the gap vanishes both at @xmath48 and @xmath57 with a maximum around @xmath92 .",
    "a similar behavior has been observed for the y - component structure factor at the antiferromagnetic wave vector @xmath70 .",
    "it shows that the onset of transverse field opens a gap which stabilizes the antiferromagnetic ( af ) order in y - direction .",
    "the af ordering becomes maximum at @xmath92 and start to decrease by further increasing of the magnetic field .",
    "the long range magnetic order vanishes at the critical point ( @xmath57 ) where the gap becomes zero and the goldestone mode destroy the ordering .",
    "the data of the one dimensional model can be used within a random phase approximation to find the phase diagram of a the experiments @xcite done on cs@xmath4cocl@xmath5 .",

    "the scaling property of the energy gap has already been discussed in ref . , while there are other aspects which are open for further investigations .",
    "we would like also to comment on the number of random sampling in this method .",
    "we have plotted the x - component structure factor at @xmath70 versus temperature in fig.[figa ] for different sampling , @xmath93 and the exact diagonalization on the full spectrum .",
    "it shows that @xmath94 is enough to get a good accuracy for the finite temperature behavior .",
    "a similar data for the specific heat versus temperature and @xmath95 in fig.[figb ] shows that the number of @xmath96 sampling reproduces well the exact results .",
