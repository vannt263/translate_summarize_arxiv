    "if set of vectors @xmath20 is orthogonal set , then this is pythagorean theorem  [ ptthrm ] .",
    "if set of vectors @xmath20 is linearly independent ( li ) but nonorthogonal set , then we refer this as linoep theorem . in this case ,",
    "pairwise orthogonality is not required and only last two vectors ( i.e. @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) are orthogonal .",
    "it is interesting to note that , although vectors in the linoep theorem are not orthogonal , yet it satisfy the same property ( preserve the energy or square of the norm ) that is being satisfied the pythagorean s theorem when all vector are orthogonal .",

    "we propose a general approach to obtain linoep vectors using iterative filtering operations .",
    "filtering operation is a class of signal processing that transfers the desired frequency components and removes completely or partially unwanted frequency components or features of a signal .",
    "usually the filters are of low pass , high pass , band pass or band stop type .",
    "filters may be analog or digital , linear or nonlinear , time - invariant or time - variant , discrete - time or continuous - time , linear - phase or nonlinear - phase , infinite impulse response ( iir ) or finite impulse response ( fir ) type of discrete - time filter , etc .",
    "a linear time - invariant ( lti ) zero - phase filter is a special case of a linear - phase filter in which the phase slope of frequency response is zero , i.e. its frequency response , always greater than zero in the filter passbands , is a real and even function of frequency .",
    "a lti zero - phase filter can not be causal except in the trivial case when the filter operation is a constant scale multiplier to a signal .",
    "however , in many off - line applications , such as when filtering a data file stored on a memory , causality is not a requirement , and zero - phase filters are preferred because zero - phase filtering preserves salient features ( e.g. maxima , minima , etc . ) in the filtered time waveform exactly at the time where those features occur in the unfiltered waveform .",

    "<S> in this paper , we propose a general method to obtain a set of linearly independent non - orthogonal yet energy ( square of the norm ) preserving ( linoep ) vectors using iterative filtering operation and we refer it as filter mode decomposition ( fdm ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the general energy preserving theorem ( ept ) , which is valid for both linearly independent ( orthogonal and nonorthogonal ) and linearly dependent set of vectors , proposed by singh p. et al . is a generalization of the discrete spiral of theodorus ( or square root spiral or einstein spiral or pythagorean spiral ) . from the ept </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain the ( 2d ) discrete spiral of theodorus and show that the multidimensional discrete spirals ( e.g. a 3d spiral ) can be easily generated using a set of multidimensional energy preserving unit vectors . </S>",
    "<S> we also establish that the recently proposed methods ( e.g. empirical mode decomposition ( emd ) , synchrosqueezed wavelet transforms ( sswt ) , variational mode decomposition ( vmd ) , eigenvalue decomposition ( evd ) , fourier decomposition method ( fdm ) , etc . ) , for nonlinear and nonstationary time series analysis , are nonlinear time - invariant ( nti ) system models of filtering . </S>",
    "<S> simulation and numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of linoep vectors .    * _ keywords : _ * the fourier series , linearly independent non - orthogonal yet energy preserving ( linoep ) vectors , orthogonal series approximation , nonlinear time - invariant ( nti ) systems , filter mode decomposition ( fdm ) . </S>"
