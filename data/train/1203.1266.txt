    "hw virginis ( hw vir ) systems consist of a subdwarf b or ob ( sdb or sdob ; hereafter referred to as sdb ) plus a main sequence star , which form an eclipsing pair in a compact orbit , @xmath1 d @xcite .",
    "these systems are believed to evolve through a common envelope phase when the primary ( sdb ) is a red giant . during this stage , the secondary star ( dm )",
    "spirals in towards the primary one and the potential gravitational energy released is absorbed by the envelope , which is subsequently ejected @xcite .",
    "the final separation between the dm and the sdb stars depends on the initial mass ratio of the binary and the initial separation .",
    "sdb stars consist of a helium - burning core covered by a thin hydrogen - dominated envelope .",
    "the atmosphere abundance is normally @xmath12(he)@xmath13(h ) @xmath14 0.01 , the effective temperatures are in the range of 2200037000 k , and the logarithmic surface gravities are normally between 5.2 and 5.7 .",
    "they populate a narrow strip on the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) in the hertzsprung - russell diagram .",
    "the single - star stellar evolution predicts a narrow mass range : 0.46  0.50 m@xmath15 ( dorman et al .",
    "1993 ) . on the other hand , models based on binary evolution",
    "predict a broader range of masses , from 0.3 to 0.8 m@xmath15 ( han et al .",
    "hence an important step in understanding the origin of sdb stars is the determination of their mass distribution .",
    "a recent review of sdb stars is presented by @xcite .",
    "there are currently ten members of the hw vir class , whose main features are summarised in table  [ tab : known ] . among them , nsvs14256825 ( 2massj2020 + 0437 ; hereafter referred to as nsvs1425 ) is one of the least studied .",
    "it was discovered in the public data from the northern sky variability survey @xcite . the sole information on this system comes from the photometric data by @xcite .",
    "these authors obtained b , v , and i@xmath0 photometric light curves .",
    "the main parameters obtained by @xcite are listed in table  [ tab : known ] .",
    "[ tab : known ]    [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]      an interesting spectroscopic signature in eclipsing binary systems is the rossiter - mclaughlin ( rm ) effect @xcite .",
    "this effect occurs when the eclipsed object rotates .",
    "there is evidence of this effect on the radial velocity curve in the phase interval @xmath16 ( figure  [ lc_rv ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , our data are not enough to model the rm effect to derive the alignment rotational parameters of the nsvs1425 stars",
    ". however , our observed points are consistent with the predicted rm effect for aligned rotating stars obtained by the wd code with the parameters shown in table  [ sytem : parameters ] .",
    "of all hw vir systems , the primary of nsvs1425 has the second highest temperature ( see table  [ tab : known ] ) , consistent with the prominent heii@xmath174686 line ( see figure  [ fig : spectrum ] ) .",
    "accordingly , we suggest that the primary of nsvs1425 is an sdbo star which means this system is very similar to aa dor and , hence , in a rare evolutionary stage @xcite .    comparing the values of @xmath18 derived from the simultaneous fit to photometric and spectroscopic data ( table  [ fundamental : parameters ] ) with those obtained from the modelling of the spectral lines of the primary star ( section  [ spectra_fitting ] ) , it is clear that the model with metallicity equal to that adopted by provides consistent results , whereas the model with zero metallicity has a discrepancy .",
    "we noticed that the same kind of discrepancy had been found by in the analysis of the primary in aa dor .",
    "obtained @xmath19 from spectroscopic data , whereas @xcite had derived @xmath20 from photometric data modelling .",
    "this discrepancy was solved by with the improvement of the stark broadening modelling , the minimisation of the reflection effect , and adoption of metal - line blanketing .",
    "@xcite , from a detailed binary population synthesis study , presented three possible channels for forming sdb stars :    1 .",
    "_ one or two phases of common envelope ( ce ) evolution _ ; 2 .   _ one or two stable roche lobe overflows _",
    "a merger of two he - core white dwarfs_.    @xcite and @xcite suggest another scenario to form an sdb star with low mass in binaries called post - rgb .",
    "this scenario is similar to the channel ( i ) proposed by @xcite , except that the resultant sdb in the first ce phase has insufficient mass in its core to ignite helium .",
    "however , it will evolve as a helium star through the sdb star region to form a helium core white dwarf .    in figure  [ txlogg ]",
    "we compare the position of the primary component of nsvs1425 on the ( @xmath21 , @xmath18 ) diagram with other sdb stars in short - period binary systems ( see table  [ tab : known ] ) .",
    "we also show a sample of single sdb and sdob stars analysed by @xcite . in the same graph we display evolutionary tracks for different masses in the post - ehb calculated by @xcite for single star evolution . as can be seen",
    ", the position of the nsvs1425 primary is close to that of the aa dor primary .",
    "the evolutionary track for single star evolution would only marginally explain the mass obtained for the sdb star in nsvs1425 . out of the possible channels to form an sdb in binaries",
    ", we suggest that the channel ( i ) is probably the evolutionary scenario for nsvs1425 .",
    "we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of the nsvs1425 system . with a short orbital period , @xmath22 d ,",
    "this binary shows both primary and secondary eclipses and a prominent reflection effect . from the spectroscopic analysis we obtain @xmath23 for the semi - amplitude of the radial velocity and @xmath24 for the systemic velocity .",
    "the atmospheric parameters of the primary component ( sdob star ) , namely , effective temperature , @xmath25 k , surface gravity , @xmath26 , and helium abundance , @xmath4/@xmath27 , were calculated matching the observed spectrum to a grid of nlte synthetic spectra .",
    "simultaneously fitting the u , b , v , r@xmath0 , i@xmath0 , j , and h - bands light curves and radial velocity curve using the wd code , the geometrical and physical parameters of nsvs1425 were obtained .",
    "these results allow us to derive the absolute parameters of the system such as masses and radii of the components .",
    "we compare the position of the sdb star in nsvs1425 with other sdb and sdob stars on the effective temperature versus surface gravity diagram .",
    "we describe the possible channels to form an sdb star in binaries and conclude that the post - common envelope development is probably the evolutionary scenario for nsvs1425 .",
    "the subsequent evolution of this system should lead to a cataclysmic variable . after a phase of angular momentum loss via gravitational radiation",
    ", this system will lie below the period gap of the cataclysmic variables .",
