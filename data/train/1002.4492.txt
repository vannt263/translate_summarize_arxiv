    "it is now commonly accepted that the composite boson nature of excitons plays a key role in their many - body physics : the undistinguishability of the two carriers from which excitons are constructed leads to all kinds of elaborate exchange processes which can hardly be handled within a nave bosonic framework .",
    "these exchange processes enter exciton - exciton interactions which are known to be the main source of nonlinearity in optical properties of semiconductors . among them , we can cite stimulated scattering@xcite , polarization change@xcite , bistable@xcite and multistable@xcite behaviors and exciton spin relaxation@xcite .",
    "exchange between indistinguishable quantum particles has also been shown to play a fundamental role in the physics of bose - einstein condensation.@xcite interest of this argument is renewed by recent observations of polariton condensates@xcite , polaritons being mixed states of one exciton and one photon . in pioneering experiments@xcite",
    "addressed to fluid propagation of a coherent polariton gas@xcite , the formation of vortices@xcite has just been evidenced .",
    "it is however worth noting that , although theoretically predicted much longer ago@xcite , the experimental observation of bose - einstein condensation of a pure exciton gas remains a challenge @xcite , in spite of very many different attempts @xcite .",
    "possible reason for not observing exciton bose - einstein condensation can actually be due to the fact that excitons must condense into a dark state @xcite . here too , carrier exchanges play a key role since exchange between two opposite spin bright excitons produce two opposite spin dark excitons .",
    "a correct handling of the exciton composite nature thus is a request , not only from the theoretical point of view , but also to correctly understand the experimental data .",
    "one of the most drastic mathematical difference between elementary bosons and composite bosons made of two free fermions with momenta @xmath0 , as the wannier excitons , is the fact that the prefactor in the @xmath1-particle closure relation is @xmath2 when the particle composite nature is kept while it is @xmath3 only when these particles are replaced by elementary bosons @xcite .",
    "this prefactor difference proves that the formal replacement of wannier excitons by elementary bosons is a dream , even in the extreme dilute limit of just @xmath4 excitons , because all sum rules which result from closure relation , are going to be different , whatever the exciton - exciton effective scatterings .",
    "by contrast , it is worth noting that the closure relation for frenkel excitons @xcite , which are made of electron - hole pairs localized on the same ion site , has the same @xmath3 prefactor as the one of elementary bosons .",
    "the reason is that , instead of two degrees of freedom @xmath0 , frenkel excitons have one only : the ion site @xmath5 .    from a mathematical point of view , the composite nature of particles constructed on two free fermions makes the exciton basis for @xmath1-pair states overcomplete",
    " except for @xmath6 . as a mere consequence ,",
    "the @xmath1-wannier - exciton states are not orthogonal .",
    "while a non - orthogonal basis is rather easy to handle , the intrinsic overcompleteness of the wannier - exciton state basis can not be eliminated in a self - consistent way .",
    "this makes all attempts @xcite to work with an orthogonalized exciton state set , doomed to failure because the difficulty is not so much to find a procedure to orthogonalize the states but to reduce their number consistently . in the following",
    ", we will restrict to wannier excitons since those are the ones for which the composite - boson nature shows up the most dramatically .",
    "having , on the one hand , understood the intrinsic difficulty linked to the overcompleteness of @xmath1-pair states when written in terms of exciton operators , being , on the other hand , fully convinced that these exciton states constitute the relevant basis @xcite for a proper description of many - body effects in a dilute system of electron - hole pairs , we have recently constructed a formalism @xcite which allows us to handle this overcompleteness in an exact way .",
    "the conceptual difference between our formalism and the green function formalism developed long ago for elementary quantum particles lies in the fact that this composite boson formalism uses an operator algebra based on commutators between exciton creation operators @xcite , while the green function formalism relies on scalars only .",
    "the link between the overcompleteness of exciton states and the exciton composite nature is evidenced through the relation @xmath7 which comes from the two different ways to associate two electrons and two holes into two wannier excitons .",
    "@xmath8 is the creation operator for exciton @xmath9 having @xmath10 as center - of - mass momentum and @xmath11 as relative motion index .",
    "the 2 by 2 pauli scattering @xmath12 , shown in fig.1 , describes fermion exchange between two excitons in states @xmath13 in the absence of fermion interaction .",
    "the real difficulty with composite excitons is to produce a formalism unchanged with respect to the above identity .",
    "our composite - boson many - body theory @xcite does it in an exact self - consistent way .     for fermion exchange between two excitons",
    "starting in `` in '' states @xmath13 and ending in `` out '' states @xmath14 .",
    "electrons are represented by solid lines and holes by dashed lines . ]    as @xmath15 in eq.(1 ) is a dimensionless quantity , such pure exchange scatterings can not appear alone in effective scatterings ruling the time evolution of two excitons because these effective scatterings must be energy - like quantities .",
    "however , when mixed with coulomb process , these carrier exchanges , which come from the intrinsic undistinguishablity of the exciton fermionic components , become crucial because they readily lead to _ six _ different energy - like scatterings between two excitons .",
    "these depend on how the carriers of the two excitons are associated in the `` in '' and `` out '' states @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the resulting six different scatterings are shown in figs.(2,3 ) . in the direct coulomb scattering @xmath16 , shown in fig.2(a ) , the excitons @xmath17 and @xmath9 are made with the same carriers while in @xmath18 obtained by a @xmath14 permutation , their two carriers are different , so that @xmath19 can be seen as a direct coulomb scattering followed by two pauli scatterings for carrier exchange in the absence of carrier interaction [ see fig.2(b ) ] .     and ending in `` out '' states @xmath14 for carrier interaction in the absence of carrier exchange .",
    "( b ) : a @xmath14 permutation can be seen as the result of a double carrier exchange . ]",
    "the direct coulomb scattering @xmath16 is given by @xcite @xmath20 @xmath21 is the wave function of an exciton in state @xmath9 , its electron being located at @xmath22 and its hole at @xmath23 .",
    "coulomb interaction between two electrons reads @xmath24 and similarly for the other coulomb terms .",
    "the above expression of @xmath16 visually follows from the diagrammatic representation of fig.2(a ) .",
    "in addition to direct coulomb scatterings , two excitons can also have exchange coulomb scatterings . in @xmath25 and @xmath26 ,",
    "the excitons @xmath17 and @xmath9 have the same electron but a different hole , while in @xmath27 and @xmath28 obtained from a @xmath14 permutation , they have the same hole but a different electron .",
    "these exchange coulomb scatterings result from a succession of direct coulomb scattering and pauli scattering for carrier exchange .",
    "fig.3(a ) shows that @xmath25 reads as @xmath29 with @xmath30 exchanged in the @xmath14 wave functions .",
    "it turns out that , as briefly rederived below , @xmath31 in which coulomb interaction takes place _ after _ carrier exchange , does not enter the effective scattering ruling the time evolution of two excitons @xcite .",
    "this is due to a very fundamental reason linked to symmetry breaking in the evolution towards positive time .",
    "it however is of interest to note that , as physically expected , a symmetry between these two exchange coulomb scatterings exists in the large time limit : indeed , we do have @xcite @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the @xmath9 exciton energy , so that the two exchange coulomb scatterings are equal for energy - conserving processes , i.e. , when time reversal is expected .    even if @xmath31 does not enter the effective scattering ruling the time evolution of two excitons , we are nevertheless left with four different energy - like quantities .",
    "being equally relevant since they only differ by the intrinsic fermion undistinguishability , these four scatterings must appear on equal footing in the effective scattering ruling the time evolution of two excitons .",
    "consequently , this effective scattering must read as a linear combination of four terms , each of these four terms containing two coulomb attractions and two coulomb repulsions .",
    "such a complex structure is a direct consequence of the particle composite nature .",
    "some tricky compensations can then take place in this linear combination , to possibly end with an effective scattering , either very close to zero , or even exactly equal to zero for some specific configurations ; the corresponding initial state can then be seen as `` frozen '' at first order in coulomb processes .",
    "in a previous work @xcite , we found that the effective scattering of two excitons having _ same _ initial momentum cancels for a finite value of the momentum transfer .",
    "this particular transfer however has no physical relevance because it does not correspond to process in which energy is conserved .",
    "being still puzzled by this somewhat unexpected cancellation , we wanted to reconsider the problem more in details in order to see if the exciton - exciton effective scattering which rules the time evolution of two excitons can cancel for some energy - conserving configurations .",
    "this is the purpose of the present work .",
    "we here show that , indeed , there are some configurations in which the effective scattering ruling the time evolution of two excitons does cancel while energy is conserved . as a result ,",
    "the corresponding scattering configurations are forbidden at first order in the interaction . for some electron - to - hole mass ratio close to 1/2",
    ", the effective exciton - exciton scattering can even stay very close to zero in all directions provided that the initial momentum difference has a very specific value .",
    "this particular initial configuration then appears as somewhat magic because excitons do not scatter through first - order coulomb process .",
    "such a cancellation however requires initial exciton momenta above a threshold value which is far larger than the typical photon momenta , i.e. , the momenta of the photocreated excitons .",
    "excitons in their relative motion ground state with a larger kinetic energy can however be formed through collisions between excited state excitons resulting from photon excitation above the absorption edge .",
    "however , independently from its possible observation , it is of importance to understand that the exciton - exciton effective scattering can collapse as a result of the exciton composite nature . to reveal its existence",
    "thus constitutes a relevant part of the overall understanding of exciton - exciton interaction .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows .    in section",
    "ii , we construct the effective scattering which rules the time evolution of two excitons as imposed by the particle quantum nature . in order to better grasp the importance of the fermion / boson nature of the particles as well as the consequence of fermionic components in this effective scattering , we here briefly rederive the time evolution of two elementary fermions , two elementary bosons , and two wannier excitons .",
    "this allows us to evidence that a possible collapse of the effective scattering is a fundamental property of elementary fermions , this collapse appearing above a threshold only in the case of composite bosons made of two fermions .    in section iii",
    ", we study the possible cancellation of this effective exciton - exciton scattering for energy conserving configurations . to this end , we perform a numerical calculation of the `` in '' exchange coulomb scattering appearing in this effective scattering in the most general case , i.e. , for initial excitons having different momenta and arbitrary mass ratio .",
    "we then restrict to energy - conserving configurations and study the dependence of the effective scattering on exciton momentum difference , scattering angle and electron - to - hole mass ratio .",
    "we pay particular attention to the magic configuration in which the effective scattering stays close to zero in all directions .    in section iv , we conclude .",
    "in order to analyse the exciton momentum configuration possibly leading to a cancellation of the exciton effective scattering , we will , for simplicity , restrict to 2d scatterings in which the excitons stay in their relative motion ground state , i.e. , processes in which all the relative motion indices @xmath34 are equal to @xmath35 .",
    "this restriction requires two conditions to be met :    \\1 ) the quantum well should be narrow enough to possibly consider one confined level only .",
    "\\2 ) the exciton momenta , p , should be small enough to avoid scattering towards unbound electron - hole pairs .",
    "this essentially imposes an exciton kinetic energy smaller than the 2d binding energy , namely , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the exciton center - of - mass mass , @xmath38 the inverse exciton relative motion mass and @xmath39 the 3d exciton bohr radius . for @xmath40",
    ", this condition reads @xmath41 .",
    "it is shown in fig.4 as a function of the mass ratio @xmath42    , for which the exciton kinetic energy is equal to its binding energy , as a function of mass ratio @xmath43 . ]    also for simplicity , we will not here consider the exciton spin degrees of freedom : this physically corresponds to take the electrons ( holes ) of the two excitons with same spin .     and",
    "@xmath44 transform into `` out '' excitons with momenta @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "( b ) : in the center - of - mass frame , which corresponds to set @xmath47 , these excitons have momenta @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "energy conserving processes , which are the relevant ones in the large time limit , lead to @xmath50 : momenta follow a simple rotation in the center - of - mass frame , as shown by the dashed circle . ]",
    "since the total center - of - mass momentum @xmath51 of two excitons is conserved in a scattering process , we are led to write the center - of - mass momenta of the two initial excitons as @xmath52 and @xmath44 , while the ones of the two final excitons are written as @xmath45 and @xmath46 [ see fig.5(a ) ] .",
    "as physical results can not depend on frame momentum , we can , without any loss of generality , set @xmath53 equal to zero .",
    "this leads us to rewrite the effective scattering for the configuration of interest as , [ see fig.6 ] , @xmath54    it will also appear as convenient to introduce the two momentum transfers @xmath55 of this scattering process .",
    "these are defined as @xmath56 due to carrier undistinguishability , exciton with initial momentum @xmath57 can as well end with the final momentum @xmath58 or @xmath59 , which corresponds to change @xmath60 into @xmath61 [ see fig.5(b ) ] .     and final momenta @xmath49 in the center - of - mass frame . ]    since @xmath62 , while @xmath63 , these momentum transfers are such that @xmath64 for @xmath65 .",
    "we can also note that , for scatterings staying within the same exciton relative motion subspace , i.e. , for excitons all having the same relative motion index @xmath35 , energy conservation imposes @xmath66 , i.e. , @xmath50 : the scattered momentum then evolves on a radius @xmath67 circle .",
    "this @xmath50 condition also reads @xmath68 . as @xmath69",
    ", the condition @xmath70 implies @xmath71 .",
    "this shows that , for a given @xmath67 , the final states having the energy of the initial state , are fully determined by the scattering angle @xmath72 between @xmath57 and @xmath73 .",
    "as we are mainly interested in energy conserving processes , we will ultimately study the effective scattering @xmath74 of two excitons as a function of the scattering angle @xmath72 and half the initial exciton momentum difference @xmath75 , for various electron - to - hole mass ratios .      to better grasp the importance of the particle composite nature and to relate the possible collapse of the effective @xmath76 scattering to the particle fermionic / bosonic nature ,",
    "let us first consider two _ elementary _ quantum particles having initial momenta @xmath77 and final momenta @xmath49 in the center - of - mass frame @xmath78 ) .",
    "the time evolution of the initial state @xmath48 is given by @xmath79 where @xmath80 creates the elementary particle of interest with momentum @xmath57 .",
    "depending on the particle quantum nature , these operators are such that @xmath81 with @xmath82 for fermions and @xmath83 for bosons .",
    "the above equation leads to @xmath84 .    the simplest way to calculate",
    "@xmath85 is to use the integral representation of the exponential . for @xmath86",
    ", it reads @xmath87 where @xmath88 is an arbitrary positive constant . the probability to go from @xmath48 to @xmath49",
    "is thus given by @xmath89 to go further and calculate the matrix element in this integral , we use the following identity valid for @xmath90 , this identity being the key for correlation effects with elementary quantum particles , @xmath91    for @xmath92 and @xmath93 given by @xmath94 this leads us to write , at first order in the interaction , @xmath95 this shows that , due to the quantum particle undistinguishability , the effective scattering which rules the time evolution of two elementary particles starting in state @xmath48 and ending in a different state @xmath49 is made of two processes which differ by a particle exchange , @xmath96    in the case of two fermions , this effective scattering reduces to @xmath97 , the minus sign being standard for process associated to fermion exchange .",
    "this shows that the effective scattering ruling the time evolution of two elementary fermions cancels for @xmath64 , i.e. , for @xmath58 perpendicular to @xmath57 , with in addition @xmath98 in the case of energy - conserving processes .",
    "let us stress that this effective scattering sign change should not be taken as a change from repulsion to attraction between the particles at hand : this latter characteristic is fully linked to the sign of the elementary scattering @xmath99 in the hamiltonian , not to the sign of the effective scattering ruling the time evolution of two fermions , as obvious from the fact that this effective scattering anyway appears as a square modulus in the fermi golden rule .",
    "by contrast , the effective scattering of two elementary bosons is given by @xmath100 , so that such a cancellation does not occur .",
    "the possible cancellation of the effective scattering ruling the time evolution of two elementary quantum particles thus appears as a characteristic of the particle fermionic nature . a memory of this fermionic cancellation is going to show up in the case of excitons made of two free fermions , but above a momentum threshold only .",
    "we now turn to the time evolution of two wannier excitons made of linear combination of free fermion pairs .",
    "let @xmath8 be the creation operator of one exciton in state @xmath9 .",
    "this operator is such that @xmath101 . due to the exciton composite nature",
    ", the scalar product of two - exciton states is given by @xcite @xmath102 + [ m\\leftrightarrow n]\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath103 and @xmath12 is the pauli scattering for fermion exchange in the absence of fermion interaction , shown in fig.1 .    to get the time evolution of the two - exciton state @xmath104",
    ", we use a procedure similar to the one we have used in the case of elementary quantum particles .",
    "equation ( 8) allows us to write @xmath105 since the semiconductor hamiltonian does not split in terms of exciton operators as @xmath106 , we can not use eq.(10 ) .",
    "correlations betwen excitons then follow from a similar equation in which enters the exciton creation operator , namely @xcite , @xmath107 where the operator @xmath108-e_ib_i^\\dag$ ] describes the interactions of exciton @xmath9 with the rest of the system . to go further",
    ", we introduce the direct coulomb scattering @xmath29 formally defined as @xcite @xmath109=\\sum_{mn}\\xi^\\mathrm{dir}\\left(^{n\\ \\,j}_{m\\   i}\\right)b_m^\\dag b_n^\\dag\\ .\\ ] ] its precise value is given in eq.(2 ) and its diagrammatic representation is shown in fig.2(a ) .",
    "it is then easy to show that , to lowest order in the interaction , @xmath110 where @xmath111 . using the scalar product of two - exciton states given in eq.(14 )",

    "the undistinguishability of the electron - hole components of the excitons leads to an effective scattering made of four terms instead of two as in the case of elementary quantum particles : starting from the direct coulomb scattering @xmath115 , the three other scatterings correspond either to exchange one electron or one hole as in the two exchange coulomb scatterings @xmath116 of figs.3(a , b ) , or to exchange the two carriers , which is nothing but a @xmath117 exchange in @xmath118 as shown in fig.2(b ) .",
    "since a fermion exchange brings a minus sign , we end with an effective scattering for the process of fig.6 made of two terms with a plus sign and two terms with a minus sign : @xmath119 each of these four terms being actually made of two coulomb repulsions and two coulomb attractions , as seen from eq.(2 ) .",
    "due to such a complex structure , it is far from obvious to physically guess the sign of the resulting effective scattering and its possible cancellation .",
    "we are going to show that , as for two elementary fermions , the effective scattering for the time evolution of two excitons can cancel .",
    "however , for energy conserving process , this cancellation requires a difference between initial momenta larger than a threshold value : for lower initial momentum difference , the exciton bosonic nature dominates : the effective scattering , like for two elementary bosons , keeps a constant sign for all scattering configurations .    actually , due to a quite subtle interplay between the various coulomb contributions existing in this effective scattering , interplay which deeply depends on possible symmetry between electron and hole , we even find that , when the electron - to - hole mass ratio is close to 1/2 , the effective scattering stays essentially equal to zero in all directions , provided that the initial momentum difference has a very specific value . while the cancellation of the effective scattering for a particular value of the scattering angle is quite standard for elementary fermions , the possible cancellation of this effective scattering _ in all scattered directions _ is far more subtle , being deeply linked to the exciton composite nature .",
    "it is worth noting that the mass ratio 1/2 to have this somewhat magic cancellation essentially separates hydrogen - like excitons @xmath120 from positronium - like excitons for which the electron and hole play a quite symmetrical role .      as seen from eqs.(20 ) or ( 22 ) , the effective scattering ruling the time evolution of two excitons is made of two direct terms and two exchange terms .      in previous works @xcite",
    ", we showed that the direct exciton - exciton scattering @xmath121 in which excitons with momenta @xmath57 and @xmath58 are made with the same electron - hole pair , can be written analytically in terms of the exciton momentum transfer @xmath62 . in the case of 2d ground state excitons",
    "for which @xmath122 , where @xmath39 is the 3d bohr radius , this scattering reads , in @xmath123 unit for momentum and @xmath124 unit for scattering , @xmath125 ^ 2\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath126 while @xmath127 .",

    "such a cancellation can be physically understood by noting that the exciton composite nature does not show up in a direct scattering , so that excitons basically behave as two classical dipoles , these dipoles being fully symmetrical when the electron and hole masses are equal .      by contrast , the `` in '' exchange scattering can not be calculated analytically .",

    ", we also calculated @xmath158 for @xmath146 .",

    "however , since energy conserving scattering when @xmath146 imposes @xmath165 , i.e. , @xmath129 , such a momentum transfer @xmath161 for cancellation of @xmath166 is of no physical relevance because it corresponds to process in which energy is not conserved .",

    "since the direct coulomb scattering is analytically known , this means that we have to numerically calculate the `` in '' exchange coulomb scattering for arbitrary initial momenta . from it",
    ", we will then determine , for various scattered angles @xmath72 and mass ratios @xmath144 , the value of the initial momentum difference for which the effective scattering defined in eq.(26 ) cancels when @xmath50 , i.e. , when energy is conserved .",

    "this behavior is shown in fig.7 , which gives the effective scatterings for three different values of @xmath67 taken below , at and above threshold , namely , @xmath189 , @xmath178 and @xmath190 .",
    "we in particular see that , for @xmath191 , cancellation occurs for @xmath192 .     for energy conserving processes as a function of half the initial momentum difference p and the angle @xmath72 between initial and scattered momenta when the hole mass is infinite .",
    "the full lines correspond to constant @xmath193 , the heavy one corresponding to @xmath194 . ]     for effective scattering cancellation as a function of the angle between initial and scattered momenta when the hole mass is infinite .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to the treshold value @xmath195 above which cancellation can occur [ see eq.(35 ) ] . ]    using eq.(34 ) , it is possible to calculate the effective scattering as a function of half the momentum difference @xmath67 and the angle @xmath72 between scattered momenta . in fig.8 , the effective scattering landscape for energy conserving configurations",
    "is shown for a large range of @xmath67 values .",
    "the heavy line corresponds to zero effective scattering .",
    "sections with planes where @xmath67 is constant give curves similar to the ones of fig.7 . since the direct coulomb scattering @xmath118 is always positive [ see eq.(23 ) ] , fig.8 shows how compensation between direct and exchange coulomb processes evolves to produce cancellation .",
    "the @xmath196 heavy line separates the effective scattering surface into two regions ; when @xmath197 , the exchange term dominates over the direct one as in the small momentum limit .    in order to better characterize this cancellation effect",
    ", we also show in fig.9 the curve @xmath198 [ defined in eq.(33 ) ] where @xmath199 cancels . among all possible final states satisfying energy and momentum conservations",
    ", this curve selects the forbidden ones at first order in coulomb process . in agreement with fig.7 ,",
    "the minimum value of @xmath200 occurs at threshold @xmath201 for @xmath184 , while for @xmath190 it occurs for @xmath202 .",
    "we now turn to the other limit , i.e. , equal electron and hole masses . as seen from eq.(27 ) , the effective scattering in the forward direction , @xmath203 , reduces to @xmath204 which is nothing but @xmath205 , due to eq.(29 ) .",
    "this effective scattering is thus found to cancel for @xmath67 equal to @xmath206 [ see eq.(30 ) ] , so that the momentum @xmath207 for cancellation of the effective scattering , defined in eq.(33 ) , is equal to @xmath208 .    through a numerical calculation of the scattering @xmath209 given in eq.(25 ) , when energy is conserved , i.e. , for @xmath50 , we can get the effective scattering @xmath210 as a function of half the momentum difference @xmath67 and scattering angle @xmath72 and determine where it cancels when energy is conserved . by comparing figs.(8 ) and",
    "( 10 ) , we see that the behaviours of @xmath193 and @xmath211 for energy conserving configurations are quite different .",
    "most strikingly , the curve @xmath212 for cancellation , shown more in details in fig.11 , has a curvature opposite to the one for infinite hole mass , shown in fig.9 : scattering in the perpendicular direction , @xmath213 , is found to cancel for a @xmath67 value @xmath214 which is larger than the value in the forward direction @xmath215 .",
    "by contrast , the minimum value of @xmath216 , when the hole mass is infinite , is reached for @xmath217 .",
    "such different behaviors of @xmath200 and @xmath212 can look quite strange at first , because , from the behaviors of these two extreme mass ratios , @xmath181 and @xmath218 , we expect , by continuity , to go through a value of @xmath219 for which @xmath168 would stay constant and equal to zero when changing the angle @xmath72 between the initial and final state exciton momenta : for half initial momentum difference equal to this constant value , the effective scattering would then stay equal to zero in all directions .     for energy conserving processes as a function of half the initial momentum difference p and the angle @xmath72 between initial and scattered momenta when the electron and hole masses are equal .",
    "the full lines correspond to constant @xmath211 , the heavy one corresponding to @xmath220 . ]     for effective scattering cancellation as a function of the angle between initial and scattered momenta for equal electron and hole masses . ]",
    "let us now determine the value of the electron - to - hole mass ratio which separates these two different regimes of curvature , in order to characterize more in details the magic initial configuration having a zero effective scattering in all directions .",
    "we start from the general form of @xmath221 given in eq.(26 ) which , together with eqs.(23 ) and ( 25 ) , gives the effective scattering as a function of the mass ratio @xmath144 and the momentum transfers @xmath222 , these momentum transfers being related to the exciton initial and final momenta @xmath142 through eq.(5 ) .",
    "we again consider energy - conserving processes , i.e. , processes such that @xmath50 .",
    "the effective scattering then depends on the initial half momentum difference @xmath67 , the angle @xmath72 between @xmath57 and @xmath73 and the mass ratio @xmath144 .",
    "let us call it @xmath223 .    in order to better see if an initial state with a zero effective scattering in all scattered directions can exist , we first look for values of the initial half momentum difference @xmath224 , and mass ratio @xmath225 , for which the effective scattering cancels in the forward and perpendicular directions .",
    "this corresponds to look for @xmath224 and @xmath225 such that @xmath226    we find that this happens for @xmath227 and @xmath228 , which corresponds to a hole mass value @xmath229 of the order of @xmath230 .",
    "figure 12 shows the half momentum difference @xmath231 for effective scattering cancellation when the mass ratio is equal to @xmath225 .",
    "we see that @xmath231 is indeed equal to @xmath224 for @xmath217 and @xmath232 but does not stay exactly equal to @xmath224 when changing @xmath72 : this half momentum difference actually shows a very small oscillation , crossing the @xmath233 value in four points when @xmath234 varies from @xmath235 to @xmath236 .",
    "although this oscillation is very small , it actually rules out a far more striking behavior , with an effective scattering staying _ exactly _ equal to zero for all scattering angles @xmath72 .     for effective scattering cancellation as a function of the angle between initial and scattered momenta when @xmath237 , i.e. , when @xmath238 .",
    "the dotted line , @xmath233 , is to guide the eyes for the weak oscillation of @xmath231 , the value of @xmath231 being exactly equal to @xmath227 for @xmath239    in order to better characterize this fundamental collapse of the effective exciton - exciton scattering , we have performed calculations for values of @xmath144 very close to @xmath225 , namely , @xmath240 : the results are shown in fig.13 and fig.14 respectively . in both cases , we find that there are very narrow ranges of @xmath67 values for which scattering cancellation occurs @xmath241 .     for cancellation of the effective scattering , as a function of the angle between initial and scattered momenta",
    "when @xmath242 . ]     for cancellation of the effective scattering , as a function of the angle between initial and scattered momenta when @xmath243 . ]",
    "of particular interest is the case @xmath242 for which , when the initial half momentum difference @xmath67 is equal to @xmath244 ( see fig.13 ) , the effective scattering stays essentially equal to zero for all scattered directions @xmath72 between @xmath245 and @xmath246 .",
    "this rather large range of @xmath72 values in which energy conserving scattering is forbidden , could possibly help to evidence this highly non intuitive fundamental collapse .",
    "we see that , for this @xmath67 value , non - zero scattering exists for @xmath247 very close to @xmath248 , i.e. , in the forward direction only .",
    "the @xmath249 mass ratio , which fundamentally separates two different regimes of curvature for @xmath250 , can be physically seen as the precise value which separates positronium - like excitons with @xmath251 ( fig.8 ) from hydrogen - like excitons with @xmath252 ( fig.10 ) .",
    "it is clear that the cancellation of the exciton - exciton effective scattering requires exciton initial momenta far larger than photon momenta , i.e. , the momenta of photocreated excitons .",
    "as a result , this quite remarkable collapse seems hard to experimentally evidence in a direct way through excitons created by resonant photons .",
    "nevertheless , its existence could have consequences in physical properties related to exciton - exciton scatterings for systems having excitons with high kinetic energy as possibly produced by non - resonant photons .    for example to explain the rise time observed in time resolved luminescence of gaas / algaas / gaas(001 ) 2d multi quantum well , the authors of ref.[39 ] speculate that exciton - exciton scattering plays a dominant role with respect to dephasing effects linked to either disorder or acoustic phonons .",
    "it is legitimate to then expect strongly different behavior when such dominant mechanism is hampered by the present cancellation effect .",
    "we wish to stress that , although rather large , the half initial exciton momentum difference @xmath253 for which scattering cancels , stays below the exciton ionization threshold , for all mass ratios considered here , as can be seen from fig.4 .",
    "consequently , the asumption of excitons staying in their fundamental ground state , under which these calculations are made , is fully valid .",
    "the present work considers quasi two - dimensional quantum wells ( @xmath254 ) with hole - to - electron mass ratio @xmath255 close to 2 ( fig.13 ) .",
    "this is easily fulfilled in high quality gaas / alas / gaas(001 ) with electron mass @xmath256=0.067 and hole mass in the parallel direction @xmath257=0.110 . the 3d bohr radius being @xmath258=17.5 nm",
    ", the 2d rydberg energy @xmath259 is of the order of 12mev while the ionization threshold for center - of mass energy is of the order of 7.8mev ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "moreover , being the difference between the lowest ( n=0 ) and the first excited state ( n=1 ) , for 2d excitons , @xmath260 we can check that the exciton kinetic energy is lower than the transition energy @xmath261 .",
    "moreover , high quality samples are necessary to minimize dephasing induced by interface disorder . a very accurate control of the sample temperature is also needed to get rid of exciton - acoustic phonon interaction .",
    "a precise control of the heavy - light hole splitting energy , induced by small difference in the lattice parameters between gaas and alas materials ( compressive strain ) is also required .",
    "note that this splitting must be added to the quantum confinement energy ( for gaas the z - masses are @xmath262 ) .",
    "all this tends to show that , altought the experimental observation of the exciton - exciton scattering cancellation is going to require a rather sophisticated tailoring of the sample as well as non - linear optical experiments designed in an unusual way , the observation of such an unexpected effect which is directly linked to the existence of fermionic components in excitons , does not seem out of reach and seems to us a challenge of physical interest .",
    "through the composite exciton many - body framework recently proposed by combescot and coworkers , we here study the effective scattering ruling the time evolution of two excitons at first order in coulomb interaction ( born approximation ) when these two excitons are in the same relative motion state but have different initial momenta .",
    "we mainly look for energy conserving configurations in which this effective scattering cancels .",
    "\\(i ) we show that the possible cancellation of this effective scattering is fundamentally due to the exciton composite nature : such a cancellation always occurs for elementary fermions but never occurs for elementary bosons . in the case of composite - boson excitons made of two fermions ,",
    "cancellation can occur but above a momentum threshold only .",
    "\\(ii ) the effective scattering ruling the time evolution of two excitons shows a strong dependence on the electron - to - hole mass ratio . for @xmath263 close to @xmath264 , which can be seen as a boundary between hydrogen - like excitons for which @xmath252 and positronium - like excitons for which @xmath251 , we find a quite remarkable cancellation of this effective scattering over a large range of scattered directions , @xmath265 , but a very narrow range of initial exciton momentum difference , @xmath266 .",
    "we wish to thank m.a .",
    "dupertuis for a valuable help in the numerical part of this work .",
    "one of us ( m.c . ) wishes to thank the italian cnr `` istituto dei sistemi complessi '' for an invitation , through the short term mobility program , during which most of this work was completed ."
