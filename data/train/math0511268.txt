    "the goal of these lectures is to give a self - contained account of recent developments concerning the theory of continuous two - dimensional and conformally invariant structures .",
    "these object are conjectured  and in some cases it is proved  to arise as scaling limits of various critical models from statistical physics in the plane .",
    "these include percolation , the ising model , the potts models , the @xmath0 models , self - avoiding walks , loop - erased and hamiltonian random walks , the uniform spanning trees .",
    "we shall briefly define these models in our first lecture .",
    "i will try to put the emphasis on one ongoing line of research rather than repeating some earlier courses and lectures on the subject .",
    "in particular , i will neither spend much time describing the definition of schramm - loewner evolutions ( sle ) nor discuss details of the aspects of the theory that have been developed prior to 2002 as this material is already available in the form of lecture notes ( including by myself ) @xcite , survey papers for theoretical physicists @xcite , and now even in an excellent book @xcite .",
    "the list of references of the present notes are therefore by no means complete ( i just listed the papers that are directly relevant to the content of the notes , as well as some historical or survey - type papers ) and it should not be considered as a `` selection '' of recent papers of the subject .",
    "one could mention many nice recent papers by m. bauer , r. bauer , bernard , dubdat , friedrich , makarov , schramm , sheffield , wilson , zhan etc . that are not listed here .",
    "sections one and three of the present lectures / notes are going to be more classical ( discrete models , sle definition ) , while the second and forth one will present recent or ongoing research .    in the first one , i will mostly present some discrete lattice - based models originating in the physics literature , and state precisely the conformal invariance conjectures .",
    "they roughly say that when the mesh - size of the lattice vanishes , the models have ( scaling ) limits , and that these limits are conformally invariant .",
    "it is important to recall that in most cases , but with certain important exceptions , these conjectures are not proved ( even on heuristic level ) , and that they rely mostly on numerical evidence , and ( now ) on the existence of nice continuous models that they would converge to .",
    "one of the `` fronts '' on which mathematicians are working is to try to prove these conjectures and one can hope for progress in the future .",
    "the problem is to work on specific discrete models , to understand some of their deep properties that enable to control their large - scale behavior",
    ". this important question will however not be the main focus of these lectures .    instead , motivated by the quest for the understanding of the large - scale properties and scaling limits of these models",
    ", we shall present some random continuous objects ( random loops , random curves , families of random loops ) and state various results that show that if the conformal invariance conjecture hold , then these continuous models are the only possible scaling limits of the discrete models",
    ".    in particular , in the second lecture , i will construct an important ( infinite ) measure supported on the set of self - avoiding loops in the plane , and show that it is the unique conformally invariant measure that satisfies a so - called restriction property ( that is shared in the discrete case by brownian loops boundaries , percolation cluster boundaries , self - avoiding loops ) .",
    "this will show that the scaling limits of these discrete models ought to be the same .",
    "the restriction property can be interpreted as an invariance under the action of a certain semi - group of conformal maps .",
    "the results presented in this lecture are derived in @xcite and inspired by ideas developed with greg lawler and oded schramm in @xcite .    in the third lecture ,",
    "i will focus on the law of one curve ( for instance an interface ) , and the ideas behind the definition of sle via iterations of random conformal maps , and survey some of the consequences .",
    "this will be reminiscent of the above - mentioned more detailed papers / lecture notes / books on sle .",
    "this can serve as an introduction to sle for those who are not acquainted to it .",
    "the readers who are may want to skip this third section .    in the fourth",
    "lecture , i shall focus on random continuous families of non - overlapping loops that possess a certain ( natural in view of the discrete models ) conformal invariance property introduced in @xcite .",
    "these are ( now ) called the `` conformal loop - ensembles '' ( cle in short ) .",
    "i shall define this property and discuss some of its first consequences .",
    "this will lead rather naturally to the definition of the brownian loop - soup and to the idea that the outer boundaries of `` subcritical '' loop - soups provide examples of cles ( and in fact these are all the possible cles ) .",
    "note that this part is `` almost sle independent '' .",
    "we will conclude these lectures by presenting briefly the gaussian free field ( gff in short ) and some of its properties .",
    "scott sheffield , together with oded schramm @xcite , is currently studying the `` geometry '' of this generalized random function in terms of sle curves , and it turns out that one can find ( in a deterministic way ) cles inside the gaussian free field , and that conversely , the field can be recovered by the cle . hence , there is a link between gff , cles , loop - soups and sles .",
    "in this section , we shall describe quickly various discrete systems that are conjectured to be conformally invariant in the scaling limit .",
    "all these discrete systems have been introduced in the physics literature .",
    "they live on ( finite or infinite portions ) of a planar lattice .",
    "we shall not discuss here the rather delicate issue of for what lattices the conformal invariance conjecture should hold .",
    "so , to fix ideas , we will assume that the lattice that we use is the square lattice , or the triangular lattice , or its dual  the honeycomb lattice .",
    "we will in fact define only two types of measures :    * infinite measures on the set of connected subsets of the lattice ( for instance polygons ) .",
    "these measures will be translation - invariant ( and therefore clearly infinite ) . * probability measures on `` configurations '' in a given finite portion of the lattice ( i.e. in a fiven domain ) .",
    "we will first describe each of these models separately , and then , in the final subsection , we shall state a precise version of the ( sometimes proved ) conformal invariance conjecture .",
    "we say that a nearest - neighbor path of length @xmath1 started from the origin , and with no double point is a self - avoiding path of length @xmath1 ( on the chosen lattice ) .",
    "the number of such walks will be denoted by @xmath2 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath3 and that @xmath4 for some @xmath5 ( by counting the number of `` north - east '' paths that are anyway self - avoiding ) , and this implies immediately that there exists @xmath6 such that @xmath7 . in other words ,",
    "the number of self - avoiding walks of length @xmath1 on the considered lattice behaves roughly like @xmath8 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath9 is a lattice - dependent constant .",
    "the length of a walk is not a quantity that is well - suited to conformal invariance .",
    "one can therefore look for self - avoiding walks with prescribed end - points but varying length , as described for instance in @xcite .",
    "another interesting possibility is to consider self - avoiding polygons instead : we say that a nearest - neighbor path @xmath10 of length @xmath1 is a self - avoiding polygon of length @xmath1 if @xmath11 and if it is otherwise self - avoiding .",
    "again , it is not difficult to see that for the same constant @xmath12 as before , the number @xmath13 of self - avoiding polygons of length @xmath1 with @xmath14 behaves like @xmath15 as @xmath16 .",
    "we are from now on going to identify two polygons @xmath17 and @xmath18 of length @xmath1 if for some @xmath19 , @xmath20 for all @xmath21 ( and @xmath17 is extended into a @xmath1-periodic function ) . in other words",
    ", there is no special marked point ( i.e. no root ) on a self - avoiding polygon .",
    "hence , @xmath13 is the number of self - avoiding polygons of length @xmath1 that pass through the origin .",
    "we define the measure @xmath22 on the set of self - avoiding polygons on the lattice in such way that for any given self - avoiding polygon @xmath17 of length @xmath23 , @xmath24 this is clearly an translation - invariant infinite measure .",
    "note that in order to define this measure , one does not need to specify any marked points or any prescribed domain .",
    "suppose that each point on the lattice has @xmath25 neighbors ( i.e. @xmath26 respectively on the hexagonal , square and triangular lattices ) .",
    "a loop is a nearest - neighbor path @xmath27 of a certain length @xmath21 , such that @xmath28 , and as before , we identify two loops modulo shift of the time - parametrization .",
    "the difference with the self - avoiding loops is that @xmath17 is allowed to have multiple points .",
    "now , define the measure @xmath29 on the set of loops that puts a weight @xmath30 to each loop of length @xmath21 ( for all @xmath31 ) .",
    "again , this is a translation - invariant measure .",
    "for each site of the considered infinite lattice , toss a coin independently : with probability @xmath32 the site is declared open , and with probability @xmath33 , it is declared vacant .",
    "then , one is interested in the connectivity properties of the set of open sites .",
    "one can consider the `` connected components '' of open sites .",
    "a connected component @xmath34 is a connected family of open sites , such that all the sites neighboring @xmath34 are closed .    for planar graphs , and at least for nice lattices , such as the ones that we shall concentrate on , one can prove ( e.g. @xcite ) that there exists a critical value @xmath35 such that :    * if @xmath36 , then with probability one , there is no infinite connected component of open sites . *",
    "if @xmath37 , then with probability one , there is a unique infinite connected component of open sites .",
    "we will from now focus solely on the critical case where @xmath38 .",
    "then , one can prove ( via the so - called russo - seymour - welsh arguments that are by the way not established for all planar lattices ",
    "one needs symmetry conditions , but these conditions are however fulfilled in the cases that we are considering , see @xcite ) that the probability of existence of open connected components at any scale is bounded away from zero and from one .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath39 and @xmath40 are two non - empty open sets ( at positive distance from each other ) in the plane , then , there exists @xmath41 such that for any sufficiently large @xmath1 , the probability @xmath42 that there exists a connected component of open sites that intersects both @xmath43 and @xmath44 satisfies @xmath45 .",
    "the percolation probability measure defines a random collection of disjoint clusters of open sites @xmath46 .",
    "all clusters are finite , but there exist clusters at any scale because of the russo - seymour - welsh type arguments .",
    "define the infinite measure @xmath47 on the set of possible clusters such that @xmath48 in other words , for any family @xmath49 of clusters , then @xmath50 is the expected number of percolation clusters that occur and belong to @xmath49 for one realization .",
    "another possible direct description of @xmath47 is @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the set of sites that are at unit distance of @xmath34 .",
    "one can equivalently describe a cluster via the collection of its `` boundaries '' .",
    "for instance , its outer boundary is a path that goes through all points of the cluster that are accessible from infinity .",
    "the value of the critical probability is lattice - dependent .",
    "the triangular lattice is special : a simple symmetry argument shows intuitively ( and this can be made rigorous , e.g. @xcite ) that for this lattice @xmath53 . in this case , the outer boundary of a cluster can be viewed as a self - avoiding loop drawn on a hexagonal grid .",
    "the measure @xmath47 defines a measure on outer boudaries of clusters that we call @xmath54 .",
    "the @xmath54 mass of a given self - avoiding loop is the probability that it is the outer boundary of a cluster .",
    "hence , for a self - avoiding loop @xmath17 on the hexagonal lattice , if @xmath55 is the number of its neighboring hexagons , @xmath56    it is also possible to define another version of percolation , where this time , the edges of the graph are independently declared to be open or closed with probability @xmath32 .",
    "one can then also define a critical probability @xmath35 , clusters of open sites and their boundaries . in this case",
    ", it turns out that the square lattice is special in that @xmath57 .",
    "we are now going to consider a system similar to the site percolation described above . in the statistical physics language , this is the ising model without external magnetic field  and everybody in this audience probably knows it . to define it , it is convenient to focus on a finite portion of the infinite lattice .",
    "one can think of this graph as the intersection of a ( large but bounded ) open subset @xmath58 of the plane with the lattice .",
    "each site @xmath59 can take one of two colors ( or spins ) : @xmath60 can be equal to @xmath61 or to @xmath62 ( a configuration @xmath63 is therefore a function that assigns to each site @xmath59 a color @xmath64 ) .",
    "two neighbors prefer however to have the same color : for each configuration @xmath63 , we define the hamiltonian @xmath65 where the sum is over all pairs of neighboring sites @xmath59 and @xmath66 in the ( finite ) considered graph .    for each value of the positive parameter @xmath67",
    ", we are now going to define a probability measure @xmath68 on the set of configurations : @xmath69 where the partition function @xmath70 is defined to be @xmath71 so that @xmath68 is indeed a probability measure .    when @xmath67 is small , the interaction between spins at neighboring sites is small , but if @xmath67 is large , it is strong .",
    "in fact , when @xmath72 then one just has percolation with @xmath73 , and in the @xmath74 limit , all sites have almost surely the same color .",
    "it turns out that for very large graphs ( and this can be rigorously stated in different ways  for instance in the limit when the graph tends to fill the infinite lattice ) , one observes different behaviors depending on the value of the parameter @xmath67 .",
    "one can note at this point ( this is for instance clear from the relation with percolation at @xmath73 for very small @xmath67 ) that for general lattices , the existence or not of very large ( infinite ) clusters of sites of the same color ( we shall say monochromatic clusters ) is not necessarily the suitable or natural observable to study .",
    "we shall however come back to this in the context of the @xmath0 models , where one sticks to the triangular lattice .    physically , for the ising model , the most relevant quantity is not related to the connectivity property of the configuration , but rather to the `` correlation functions '' .",
    "the simplest such function is the two - point function , which is simply the correlation between the value of the spin at two different sites @xmath59 and @xmath66 : @xmath75 since @xmath64 and @xmath76 are easily shown to be `` positively correlated '' , one has that @xmath77",
    ".    when @xmath67 is small , then the correlation function tends exponentially fast to zero ( when the sites are fixed and the mesh - size of the lattice goes to zero  or when the lattice is fixed and the distance between the sites increases ) .",
    "when @xmath67 is too large , then in fact @xmath78 is bounded away from zero .",
    "this corresponds intuitively to the idea that one of the two colors `` wins '' and occupies more sites than the other .",
    "the critical value of @xmath67 is the one that separates these two phases .",
    "in fact , it can be shown on the square lattice ( this is onsager s calculation ) that at this critical value , @xmath78 decays like a certain power law in terms of the mesh - size of the lattice .",
    "the potts model is a natural generalization of the ising model : this time , a site can choose between a given number @xmath79 of colors .",
    "the hamiltonian and the probability measures @xmath68 are then defined exactly in the same way as for the ising model ( and when @xmath80 , the potts model is exactly the ising model ) .",
    "one is then interested in the correlation functions @xmath81 again , one observes a supercritical phase ( where on color `` wins '' ) and a subcritical phase ( with exponentially decaying correlations ) .",
    "however , when @xmath82 is large , it is believed ( in fact it is proved for very large @xmath82 ) that at the critical value of @xmath67 , one still has one `` winning color '' .",
    "hence , the critical model will exhibit interesting phase coexistence properties only for small values of @xmath82 .",
    "the conjecture is that in two dimensions , this will hold up to @xmath83 .    for both the ising model and the potts model , we have just described the model with so - called `` free '' boundary conditions .",
    "it is possible to condition the probability measure by constraining the sites on the boundary of the domain to take a given color or given colors ( one can divide the boundary into two parts and assign a color to each part ) . at the critical value , and on large scale ,",
    "these boundary conditions are important and their influence does not really `` disappear '' ( of course this notion depends on what one is looking at ... ) in the scaling limit .",
    "we just mentioned that the notion of `` ising clusters '' or `` potts model clusters '' was not so natural when the lattice is not the triangular lattice .",
    "one can however relate properties of the potts models to connectivity properties of another model , which is a dependent percolation model , introduced by fortuin and kasteleyn in the 60 s , also sometimes known as the random - cluster model .",
    "this is a probability measure on configuration on `` edges '' of a graph : each edge of a finite graph can be declared open or closed .",
    "so , each configuration @xmath84 has a number @xmath85 of open edges , a number @xmath86 of closed edges , and it defines @xmath87 different open clusters ( i.e. sets of sites connected by open edges ) .",
    "the fk percolation measure with parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 is defined as @xmath90 where as before , @xmath91 is the normalizing constant .    when @xmath92 , this is just the percolation on edges mentioned before .",
    "in fact , when @xmath82 is an integer , this fk measure is closely related to the ( free ) potts model with the same @xmath82 .",
    "it is indeed easy to check that if one first chooses @xmath84 according to the fk measure , then colors each of the @xmath87 clusters independently by one of the @xmath82 colors , then the obtained coloring has exactly the law of a potts model , for a given @xmath93 . in particular",
    ", this @xmath94 where the symbol @xmath95 refers to the connectivity properties of @xmath84 and @xmath78 is the two - point function of the potts model .",
    "hence , when @xmath82 is fixed , one can relate the phase - transition of the potts model to a phase - transition in terms of connectivity properties of the random cluster measure ( letting @xmath32 vary ) for very large graphs .",
    "note however that while the potts models made sense only for integer values of @xmath82 , this fk percolation allows any positive real value of @xmath82 .",
    "the conjecture is that in two dimensions , as for the potts models , at the critical value @xmath35 , the measure exhibits nice large - scale properties up to @xmath83 only .",
    "when @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the model converges to the `` uniform spanning tree '' .",
    "this is the uniform distribution on the set of configurations with one single cluster ( all sites are connected ) but no open cycle ( i.e. the graph is a tree ) .",
    "this is a combinatorially rich model , that can be constructed using `` loop - erased random walks '' or domino tilings ( there is a bijection between the set of domino tilings and the set of uniform spanning trees ) for which other tools ( explicit determinant computations for correlations ) are also available .",
    "an interesting property of the fk model in the plane is its `` duality '' .",
    "if one looks at the dual graph @xmath98 of a sample @xmath84 of an fk model , then @xmath98 also follows an fk probability measure , on the dual graph .",
    "in particular , this leads to the notion of `` wired '' boundary conditions , where all vertices on the exterior boundary of a finite planar graph are identified , see e.g. @xcite : the dual of the `` free '' fk model is the `` wired '' one .",
    "this is a model that makes use of specific properties of hexagonal / triangular lattices .",
    "we shall be focus here on the honeycomb lattice , where each site has exactly three incoming edges , and each face has six sides , which is the dual of the regular triangular lattice . a configuration @xmath99 on ( a portion ) of the lattice",
    "will be a family of disjoint finite self - avoiding loops on this lattice .",
    "for each configuration , there are @xmath100 loops , and the total cumulated length of the loops is @xmath101 ( counted in number of steps ) .",
    "we assign to each configuration @xmath99 , a probability proportional to @xmath102 , where @xmath103 and @xmath104 are two parameters of the model .",
    "the partition function is then @xmath105 where the sum is over all admissible configurations ( in general all possible configurations in a given finite portion of the lattice ) .",
    "configuration , width=144 ]    it is worthwhile noticing that when @xmath106 , one can view the loops as the phase separation lines of the ising model on a triangular lattice , with @xmath107 related to the parameter @xmath67 of the ising model by @xmath108 . also , when @xmath109 , one can relate a conditioned version of the @xmath0 measure , to some features of the measure on self - avoiding loops ( just condition on the existence of at least one loop and let @xmath109 ) . for general integer @xmath1 ,",
    "the @xmath0 model is reminiscent of the @xmath110-potts model on the triangular lattice , but there is the important additional constraint that no small triangle has corners of three different colors .",
    "it is conjectured that when @xmath1 is not too large and fixed ( @xmath111 in fact ) , the @xmath0 model undergoes a phase transition when @xmath107 varies . and",
    ", at a critical value @xmath112 , one observes an interesting large - scale phenomena ( actually the phase where @xmath113 is interesting too ) , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "nienhuis conjectured that @xmath114 is equal to @xmath115 . in patricular ,",
    "the constant @xmath116 describing the number of self - avoiding walks on that lattice should be @xmath117 .    hence , for all @xmath111 , one has discrete probability distributions on families of disjoint self - avoiding loops in a domain , that are conjectured to behave `` nicely '' in the scaling limit .",
    "let us first concentrate on the `` probability measures '' on configurations .",
    "for all previous critical models , let us consider a fixed open subset @xmath58 of the complex plane .",
    "for each small @xmath118 , one considers a suitable discrete approximation of @xmath58 by a subset of the graph @xmath119 .",
    "we call @xmath120 this graph .",
    "we have for each @xmath118 a probability measure on configurations of disjoint loops ( for the @xmath0 models ) or clusters ( for the fk percolation ) in @xmath120 .    at this point",
    ", it is time to recall a few definitions and facts about conformal maps , and in particular riemann s mapping theorem .    *",
    "if @xmath58 and @xmath121 are two simply connected domains in the plane , we say that @xmath122 is a conformal map from @xmath58 onto @xmath121 if it is an angle - preserving bijection from @xmath58 onto @xmath121 ( angle preserving for instance means that the images of two smooth curves that intersect with angle @xmath123 are two smooth curves that intersect with angle @xmath123  it is easy to see that this is equivalent to say that at each point , @xmath124 is differentiable in the complex sense ) .",
    "* there exists a three - dimensional family of conformal maps from the unit disc onto itself : these are the moebius transformations , that one can explicitly describe and for which one can directly check that they are conformal maps .",
    "it is also easy to check that they are no other such maps .",
    "* for any two simply connected open proper subsets @xmath58 and @xmath121 of the complex plane , one can find angle - preserving bijections ( i.e. conformal maps ) from @xmath58 onto @xmath121 .",
    "in fact , there exists a three - dimensional family of such maps ( this follows from the previous item ) .",
    "this is riemann s mapping theorem .",
    "its proof can be found in any complex analysis textbook .",
    "hence , the conformal invariance conjecture implies in particular that the probability measure @xmath125 is invariant under the group of conformal maps from @xmath58 onto itself .    in the case of the infinite translation - invariant measures on loops , clusters or self - avoiding loops",
    ", the conformal invariance conjecture goes similarly : consider the measures on the lattice with mesh - size @xmath118 , and define the measures @xmath126 as the restrictions of these measures to those loops / clusters that stay in @xmath120 .",
    "then , these measures are conjectured to converge weakly to a measure @xmath127 on subsets of @xmath58 , and this limiting measure should be conformally invariant .    among these conjectures , only the following have at present been proved :    * the measure on random walk loops converges to a continuous measure on brownian loops , and it follows from the conformal invariance of planar brownian motion  known since paul lvy  that the measure on brownian loops is conformally invariant @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for convergence issues .",
    "* critical percolation on the triangular lattice ( recall that this is the special case where @xmath128 ) has been proved by smirnov @xcite to be conformally invariant .",
    "this implies the conformal invariance conjecture for the measure @xmath129 , see @xcite . * the @xmath130 limit of the fk percolation model ( the uniform spanning tree ) has been proved @xcite to converge to a conformally invariant object ( here one needs to keep track of the paths in the tree , the hausdorff topology is not well - suited ) .    in particular",
    ", it is still a challenge to prove conformal invariance of self - avoiding walks , percolation on other lattices , fk percolation and ising / potts models .",
    "let us at this point make a general comment on the theory of conformal maps : a conformal map can be viewed as acting globally on a domain , and this is the point of vue that we are going to emphasize in these lectures . on the other hand , a conformal map @xmath124 defined on @xmath58 is holomorphic at every point @xmath131 of @xmath58 , and it admits a series expansion @xmath132 in the neighborhood of @xmath131 .",
    "this local description of @xmath124 can also be very useful for instance , if one composes conformal maps .",
    "very very loosely speaking , `` conformal field theory '' that had been successfully developed by theoretical physicist to understand the scaling limit of the above - mentioned critical models , uses more this local aspect of conformal maps .",
    "also , it is important to mention that a closely related issue is the `` universality conjecture '' : if one considers the same model ( say , the critical potts model for @xmath133 ) on two different lattices ( say the square and the triangular ) , then the limiting continuous measure should be the same in the two cases , despite the fact that the critical value of the parameter @xmath32 ( resp . @xmath107 or @xmath67 ) is lattice - dependent . as we shall see in the current lectures , this can in fact be viewed as a ( non - trivial ) consequence of the conformal invariance conjecture , since we will show that only a limited number of conformal invariant possible scaling limits do exist .",
    "a standard way to state riemann s mapping theorem goes as follows : if @xmath58 and @xmath121 are two imply connected subsets @xmath134 , that are not equal to @xmath134 , and that contain the origin , then there exists unique conformal map from @xmath58 onto @xmath121 such that @xmath135 , and @xmath136 is a positive real .",
    "note that when @xmath137 , this derivative @xmath138 is necessarily smaller than one . in some sense , this number is a way to measure `` how smaller @xmath121 is compared to @xmath58 , seen from @xmath139 '' .",
    "let us now focus on the set @xmath140 of conformal maps @xmath124 from the unit disc @xmath141 onto a subset @xmath58 of @xmath141 with @xmath142 , such that @xmath135 and @xmath143 . for @xmath144 , one can write @xmath145 for any @xmath146 . clearly , one can compose two such conformal maps @xmath147 and @xmath148 , and @xmath149 is also a conformal map from @xmath141 onto a subset of @xmath141 containing the origin .",
    "the set @xmath49 is therefore a semi - group of conformal maps .    of course ,",
    "the semi - group @xmath140 is not commutative , and it is `` infinite - dimensional '' . note that characterizing the set @xmath140 in terms of the coefficients @xmath150 is not a straightforward fact ( `` can one see for which @xmath150 s , the series is univalent ",
    "i.e. injective  on the unit disc ? '' ) , see for instance the questions related to the bieberbach conjecture and its proof by de branges .",
    "this is a typical instance of the difficulty to relate local features of the conformal map ( the series expansion ) to its global features .",
    "we are looking for a measure on self - avoiding loops in the plane @xmath12 . for any domain open @xmath58",

    "we require the following property :    _ @xmath151 for any simply connected set @xmath58 and any conformal map @xmath152 , one has @xmath153 . _    in other words , we want the measures @xmath127 to be conformally invariant .",
    "as we shall see , this will turn out to be a rather strong constraint .",
    "first of all , the measure @xmath127 ( and @xmath12 therefore also ) must be an infinite measure ( if @xmath154 ) .",
    "this is just because for any @xmath137 , the total mass of @xmath155 and that of @xmath127 must be identical ( because @xmath58 and @xmath121 are conformally invariant ) . also , the measure @xmath12 must be scale - invariant and translation - invariant .",
    "let us now focus on @xmath156 .",
    "this is now a measure on the set of loops in the unit disc .",
    "consider a map @xmath157 .",
    "@xmath158 is a conformal map from a subset @xmath58 of @xmath141 onto @xmath141 .",
    "one can therefore define the measure @xmath159 as the image of the measure @xmath127 under @xmath158 .",
    "then , the conformal invariance condition is in fact equivalent to the condition that for all @xmath160 , @xmath161 .",
    "hence , @xmath151 means that @xmath156 is invariant under the action of the semi - group @xmath140 .      up to multiplication by a positive",
    "real , there exists at most one measure @xmath12 satisfying condition @xmath151 .",
    "* we proceed in several steps :    * because of conformal invariance , the whole measure @xmath12 is characterized by @xmath156 . indeed , for any simply connected domain @xmath58 , @xmath127 is conformally equivalent to @xmath156 , and the knowledge of all @xmath127 s characterizes @xmath12 . * because of conformal invariance , the measure @xmath156 is in fact characterized by the measure @xmath162 which is defined to be @xmath156 restricted to those loops in @xmath141 that disconnect the origin from the boundary of the disc . indeed , by conformal invariance , @xmath163 is conformally equivalent to @xmath162 and the knowledge of all ) @xmath163 s characterizes @xmath156 .",
    "* in fact , the knowledge of the quantities @xmath164 where @xmath160 characterizes @xmath162 ( these events form an intersection - stable family of events that generate the @xmath63-field that one uses ) .    in conclusion , we see that the measure @xmath12 is in fact characterized by the quantities , @xmath165 for @xmath160 . because of conformal invariance again",
    ", we see also that @xmath166 indeed , @xmath167    let us now define the conformal maps @xmath168 from the unit disc respectively onto the slit discs @xmath169 , where @xmath170 is chosen in such a way that @xmath171 . then , clearly , @xmath172 .",
    "this is due to the combination of two facts : because of symmetry , @xmath173 is necessarily one of the @xmath174 s for some @xmath175 , and because of the chosen normalization in terms of the derivative at the origin , @xmath176 .",
    "hence , it follows easily that for some positive constant @xmath99 , @xmath177 .    because of rotational invariance , for the same constant @xmath99 , @xmath178 where @xmath179 is this time the conformal map from @xmath141 onto @xmath180 for a fixed @xmath181 .",
    "but , loewner s theory ( we will give more details about this in a second ) that tells that any conformal map @xmath160 can be approximated by iterations of many such maps @xmath182 .",
    "it is then not difficult to conclude ( as in @xcite in a slightly different context ) that necessarily @xmath183 is equal to @xmath184 for all @xmath160 .",
    "hence , up to this multiplicative constant @xmath99 , there exists at most one candidate for a measure @xmath12 satisfying @xmath151 .",
    "this will conclude the proof of the lemma .",
    "it remains to recall a few facts from loewner s coding of slit domains : suppose that @xmath124 is a conformal map in @xmath140 from @xmath141 into a set @xmath185 $ ] , where @xmath186 is a smooth simple curve in @xmath187 with @xmath188 .",
    "we can choose the time - parametrization of @xmath186 in such a way that for each @xmath189 , the derivative at zero of the conformal map @xmath190 in @xmath140 from @xmath141 into @xmath191 $ ] is @xmath192 .",
    "in particular , @xmath193 .",
    "it turns out to be a little more convenient to work with the inverse maps @xmath194 from @xmath141 into @xmath195 $ ] .",

    "in particular , if one iterates these @xmath1 terms , one has an error term of the order of @xmath212 .",
    "hence , when @xmath1 tends to infinity , the conformal map @xmath213 converges ( in some suitable sense ) towards the conformal map @xmath214 .",
    "this argument leads to the following two consequences :    * @xmath215 when @xmath16 . *",
    "@xmath216 when @xmath16 .",
    "but , since @xmath213 is the iteration of @xmath1 conformal maps that remove straight slits , we know that @xmath217 .",
    "hence , @xmath218 is indeed equal to @xmath184 for such a slit map @xmath124 .",
    "finally , one can note that it is possible to approximate any map @xmath160 by such slit maps : for each @xmath160 and each @xmath219 , define the domain @xmath220 .",
    "it has an analytic boundary , that can be obtained via the iteration of slit maps .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath221 , both the derivative at the origin and the functional @xmath222 behave continuously .",
    "hence , the formula for @xmath223 turns out to be valid for all @xmath160 .",
    "we now have to check whether there exists a measure @xmath12 for which the formula @xmath224 holds .      * via brownian loops : * recall that the brownian loop measure is conformally invariant .",
    "this is the scaling limit of the measure on random walks loops .",
    "it is known since @xcite that a planar brownian loop has no cut - points . in particular , the boundary of the unbounded connected component of its complement is a self - avoiding loop in the plane .",
    "the measure on these loops induced by the brownian loop - measure is therefore conformally invariant .",
    "hence , this proves the existence of a measure @xmath12 satisfying @xmath151 , since this outer boundary of the brownian loop does the job !",
    "let us briefly give a proper direct definition of the brownian loop measure @xcite : it will be defined via a product measure .",
    "let @xmath225 denote the lebesgue measure in @xmath134 , @xmath226 the lebesgue measure on @xmath227 , and @xmath228 the law of a planar brownian bridge of time - length one starting and ending at the origin ( that is a standard brownian motion conditioned to be back at the origin at time @xmath61 ) .",
    "note that by scaling and translation , it is possible to transform the standard loop @xmath186 into a loop @xmath186 of length t starting and ending at @xmath229 : @xmath230 .",
    "as before , we then define @xmath231 from @xmath232 by identifying two loops if they can be obtained one from the other by time - shift .",
    "now , if we work under the product measure @xmath233 then the measure of @xmath231 is the brownian loop measure @xmath234",
    ". it will sometimes be convenient to work with multiples @xmath235 of @xmath234 , that we call the brownian loop measure with intensity @xmath99 .        * via percolation clusters : * recall the discrete measure on critical percolation clusters @xmath47 on the triangular lattice and the measure @xmath54 on their outer contours .",
    "we will be focusing here on the latter .",
    "when it is defined on the triangular lattice of mesh - size @xmath118 , we denote it by @xmath236 .",
    "it is a measure on the set of discrete self - avoiding loops .",
    "camia and newman @xcite showed how to use smirnov s result @xcite to deduce results of the following type : the limit @xmath237 of @xmath236 exists and is conformally invariant .",
    "this scaling limit can be in fact described by the sle process with parameter 6 that we will describe in the next section .",
    "it is easy to see that it is not supported on the set of self - avoiding loops .",
    "some nearby points on the discrete scale become double points in the scaling limits .",
    "however , the obtained path is still a compact loop , and one can define its outer boundary and this one is a self - avoiding loop .",
    "it is in fact not very difficult ( using some a priori estimates on five - arm exponents etc . ) to see that the measure @xmath238 on self - avoiding loops that is defined in this way is also the scaling limit of discrete `` outer perimeters of clusters '' obtained by not entering fjords of width equal to the mesh - size of the lattice .",
    "hence , critical percolation in its scaling limit also defines a measure @xmath238 on self - avoiding loops that satisfies @xmath151 .        * consequence . *",
    "it therefore follows from the preceding considerations that :    * for some constant @xmath99 , the measure @xmath238 on outer boundaries of percolation clusters is identical to the measure of outer boundaries of brownian loops defined under @xmath235 . *",
    "if the measure on self - avoiding loops has a scaling limit when the mesh - size of the lattice goes to zero , then it is also a multiple of @xmath12 .",
    "this is probably the simplest and most transparent proof of the equivalence between percolation cluster boundaries , brownian motion boundaries , and the conjectural scaling limit of self - avoiding walks .",
    "this equivalence had been obtained in a different form in @xcite , for instance to derive @xcite via sle calculations ( and this is the only existing rigorous proof of this fact at this point ) the multi - fractal spectrum of the boundary of a brownian motion with respect to harmonic measure , and in particular its hausdorff dimension @xmath239 . in our setup",
    ", it shows that the measure @xmath12 is supported on self - avoiding loops of hausdorff dimension @xmath239 .",
    "let us also note from @xcite that the whole measure @xmath12 is described by a sample of a single brownian motion . by looking at the shapes of all connected components of the complement of a sample of a brownian motion ( or a brownian loop ) , ordered according to their area ( in decreasing order ) , then the knowledge of all these shapes",
    "allows in fact to reconstruct the whole measure @xmath12 .",
    "let us now summarize the results of this lecture / section ( see @xcite for more details ) :    up to multiplication by a positive constant , there exists a unique conformally invariant measure on self - avoiding loops in the plane .",
    "it can be equivalently described as boundaries of brownian loops , via scaling limits of percolation clusters .",
    "a consequence of the study of sle defined in the next section is in fact that this measure can be defined by sle means as well , and that it is supported on the set of loops that have hausdorff dimension @xmath239 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will not go into details here , but this measure and the brownian loop measure allow to reinterpret in a simple way most nice conformally invariant quantities introduced , such as schwarzian derivatives etc . and possibly also to introduce new and natural invariants .",
    "let us however stress an important property of the measure @xmath12 :    the measure @xmath12 on self - avoiding loops is invariant under the inversion @xmath240 .",
    "more generally , it satisfies the property @xmath151 even for non - simply connected domains @xmath58 .",
    "this is not a straightforward result . while the brownian loop measure @xmath234 can easily be shown to be invariant under the inversion @xmath240 , the `` outside boundary '' of the loop ( the boundary of the connected component of its complement that contains infinity ) becomes the `` interior boundary '' ( the boundary of the connected component of its complement that contains the origin ) and the fact that brownian `` interior boundaries '' and `` outer boundaries '' are the same is rather surprising .",
    "this result has various consequences that are explored in @xcite .",
    "in particular , it allows to work on any riemann surface , and to make the theory ( loop - soups etc . )",
    "work on them .",
    "we now give a brief introduction to the sle process .",
    "the reader acquainted to it may want to skip this section .",
    "suppose that one wishes to describe the law of a random continuous curve @xmath186 in a simply connected domain @xmath58 , that joins two boundary points @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "typically , this curve would be the scaling limit of an interface in a discrete grid - based model .",
    "for instance :    * for the infinite measures on paths that we have considered ( scaling limit of percolation boundaries , brownian loops , conjectured self - avoiding loops ) , one way to get such a measure is to start with the discrete measure , and to restrict the class of loops to those that contain one chosen part of the boundary of @xmath58 between @xmath39 and @xmath40 . in other words ,",
    "the loop will consist of a path inside @xmath58 from @xmath39 to @xmath40 , and it then goes back to @xmath40 along the boundary of @xmath58",
    ". then , renormalize this ( finite ) measure in order to get a probability measure .",
    "so , this path can be viewed as a conditioned version of the loop measure . * in the fk representation of the potts models , use the following boundary conditions : on one of the two parts of ( the discretization of @xmath241 , take `` free '' boundary conditions as before , but identify all vertices on the other part as a single vertex ( this is the `` wired '' boundary condition . then the path that one is interested in in the outer contour of the cluster that is attached to the wired part of the boundary .",
    "this is indeed a path from @xmath39 to @xmath40 in @xmath58 .",
    "we are going to assume that this law on continuous curves from @xmath39 to @xmath40 in @xmath58 satisfies the following two properties that we shall refer to as 1 . and 2 . :",
    "the law of @xmath186 is invariant under the ( one - dimensional ) family of conformal maps from @xmath58 onto itself that leave @xmath39 and @xmath40 unchanged . _",

    "the law of this random curve is then conformally invariant in the sense described before ( for any triplet @xmath245 it defines a law @xmath246 on curves joining @xmath39 to @xmath40 in @xmath58 , and for any conformal map @xmath124 , @xmath247 ) .",
    "note that it is not really difficult to find a random curve satisfying 1 .",
    ": take @xmath58 to be the upper half - plane @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 .",
    "then , any random curve @xmath186 that is scale - invariant in law would do ( the conformal maps form @xmath248 onto itself that preserve @xmath139 and @xmath251 are just the multiplications by a positive constant ) .",
    "2 .   _ the `` markovian property '' _",
    ": suppose that the curve is parametrized `` from @xmath39 to @xmath40 '' and that we know how @xmath186 begins ( i.e. we know @xmath252 $ ] say ) .",

    "it is very natural to combine these two properties . in most of the relevant discrete models that are conjectured to be conformal invariant",
    ", one can find natural curves in these models ( interfaces etc . )",
    "that do satisfy a discrete analog of 2 .",
    "in particular , critical interfaces in nearest - neighbor interaction models are expected to satisfy both 1 . and 2 .",
    "schramm @xcite pointed out that there are not that many possible random curves with these two properties .",
    "they form a one - dimensional family and are the so - called sle curves ( sle stands for schramm or stochastic loewner evolutions ) . these random curves can be described and constructed via iterations of random conformal maps .",
    "let us now sketch the basic idea behind the construction of sles : suppose for instance that @xmath58 is the unit square and that @xmath39 and @xmath40 are two opposite corners",
    ". for convenience , let us focus on the case where the random curve @xmath186 is simple . construct first the path @xmath186 up to some time @xmath257 .",
    "define then the unique conformal map @xmath258 from @xmath256 $ ] onto @xmath58 such that : @xmath259 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 . the image of the path @xmath252 $ ] under @xmath258 becomes now a part of the boundary of @xmath58 ( that contains @xmath39 ) .",
    "suppose now that we continue the path @xmath186 after time @xmath257 .",
    "then , the image of this additional stretch under @xmath258 is a simple path in @xmath58 that joins @xmath262 to @xmath263 .",
    "the combinations of the properties 1 . and 2 .",
    "implies immediately that the conditional law of @xmath264 ( given @xmath252 $ ] ) is @xmath246 ( because the conditional law of @xmath265 is @xmath266 and conformal invariance holds ) . in particular , this conditional law is independent of @xmath252 $ ] .",
    "hence , @xmath252 $ ] and @xmath267 $ ] are independent and have the same law .",
    "now , the conformal map @xmath268 is clearly obtained by composing the two independent identically distributed maps @xmath269 ( corresponding to @xmath267 $ ] ) and @xmath258 .",
    "similarly , for any @xmath270 , @xmath271 is obtained by iterating @xmath1 independent copies of @xmath258 .",
    "it is therefore very natural to encode the curve @xmath186 via these conformal maps @xmath258 so that the markovian property translates into independence of the `` increments '' of @xmath258 .",
    "in fact , for any @xmath257 , @xmath258 itself can be viewed as the iteration of @xmath1 independent copies of @xmath272 .",
    "hence , for any small @xmath273 , the knowledge of the law of @xmath274 yields the law of @xmath186 at any time that is a multiple of @xmath273 .",
    "this leads to the fact that the knowledge of the law of @xmath274 for infinitesimal @xmath273 in fact characterizes the law of the entire curve @xmath186 .",
    "it turns out that there is just `` one possible direction '' in which @xmath274 can move on infinitesimal level , and this implies that there exists just a one - dimensional family of possible laws for @xmath274 , each one corresponding to a certain speed of motion in this direction .",
    "this leads to the one - dimensional family of possible sle curves .",
    "more precisely , suppose now that @xmath58 is the upper half - plane , and that @xmath249 and @xmath275 .",
    "then , the conformal map @xmath258 has a laurent expansion at infinity : @xmath276 it is easy to see that @xmath277 is positive , increasing continuously with @xmath257 , and that it is therefore natural to use a time - parametrization for which @xmath278 increases linearly ( in this way , @xmath268 is indeed obtained as the iteration of two independent copies of @xmath258 ) ; for historical reasons , the convention is to take @xmath279 .",
    "then , the markovian property implies immediately that @xmath280 is a ( real - valued ) symmetric markov process , with independent increments .",
    "this yields that @xmath281 for some constant @xmath282 where @xmath67 is a standard real - valued brownian motion .",
    "furthermore , one can recover @xmath186 if one knows only @xmath280 : one has to solve ( for each fixed @xmath229 ) the stochastic differential equation @xmath283 and see that @xmath284 .",
    "it is not easy but can be proved @xcite that this procedure indeed defines ( for any fixed @xmath285 ) almost surely a path @xmath186 .",
    "some of the sle curves can be shown to have special properties that can be related to the special features of the corresponding discrete models : the independence properties of percolation correspond to the `` locality '' property of sle@xmath286 derived and studied in @xcite .",
    "the special properties of self - avoiding walks correspond to the restriction property of sle@xmath287 related to the properties of self - avoiding walk , e.g. @xcite .    with this description of the sle curve via the previous stochastic differential equation , it is not difficult to compute directly the value of critical exponents @xcite that should for instance describe the multi - fractal spectrum of harmonic measure on these curves ( and in particular compute their dimension ) . as a look at the proof in @xcite",
    "will probably convince you , there is then still substantial work before one is allowed to state rigorously that these numbers are indeed the dimensions of the curves ( this last issue is not addressed in the theoretical physics papers devoted to this subject where the values of these exponents were first predicted  see duplantier s notes @xcite and the references therein ) .    as mentioned in our introduction",
    ", we will not go into this part of sle theory ( the interested reader may want to consult @xcite ) and focus on more recent progress .",
    "but , we ought to mention here some basic facts about sle curves ( these `` basic '' facts are by no means easy to prove ) : the fractal dimension of the sle@xmath288 curve ( see rohde - schramm @xcite for the upper bound and beffara @xcite for the involved lower bound ) is almost surely @xmath289 when @xmath290 . when @xmath291 the curve becomes space - filling @xcite and has hausdorff dimension 2 .",
    "this already show that these random curves can have different sometimes surprising fractal structures .",
    "there is also an important phase transition at the value @xmath292 : the sle curves are simple ( without double points ) when @xmath293 , and they have double points as soon as @xmath294 ; see @xcite .",
    "let us now show why these two phase transitions at @xmath292 and @xmath295 show up .",
    "we give a slightly non - rigorous description of this derivation in order to be as transparent as possible for those who are not used to stochastic analysis , but all the following steps can easily be made rigorous using standard stochastic calculus considerations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the following paragraphs is to illustrate how to perform sle calculations .",
    "the first thing to do is to see what the fact that @xmath296 hits zero at some time @xmath297 ( for a fixed @xmath229 ) means in terms of the sle curve @xmath186 .",
    "recall that the conformal map @xmath258 maps the tip of the curve @xmath298 to @xmath139 , and that it is a conformal map from ( the unbounded connected component of ) @xmath299 $ ] normalized at infinity .",
    "hence , intuitively , if @xmath300 is close to zero , then it means that `` seen from infinity '' @xmath298 and @xmath229 are very close in @xmath301 $ ] .",
    "in fact , what happens is that @xmath296 hits @xmath139 when the curve @xmath252 $ ] disconnects @xmath229 from infinity in @xmath248 .",
    "for instance , if @xmath59 is a positive real , then @xmath302 hits the origin when @xmath252 $ ] hits the interval @xmath303 .",
    "let us now consider two reals @xmath59 and @xmath66 .",
    "@xmath66 will be positive , and @xmath304 ( we will decide later if we choose @xmath59 to be positive or negative ) .",
    "then define @xmath305 since @xmath306 is the identity map , @xmath307 .",
    "it immediately follows from ( [ sleeq ] ) that @xmath308 and that @xmath309 this means that for very small @xmath257 , the law of @xmath310 can be well - approximated by @xmath311 where @xmath312 is a standard gaussian random variable with mean @xmath61 ( recall that @xmath280 is a brownian motion with speed @xmath285 ) .",
    "now let us consider the event @xmath313 that @xmath314 hits zero strictly before @xmath315 hits zero .",
    "this means that the curve @xmath186 disconnects @xmath59 from infinity strictly before it disconnects @xmath66 from infinity . because of scale - invariance of the sle curve , the probability of @xmath313 is a function of @xmath316 only , or equivalently",

    "@xmath313 means that the sle started from the origin hits @xmath331 before it does hit @xmath332 .",
    "of course , this makes sense only if the curve @xmath186 hits the real axis again at positive times .",

    "this turns out to be equivalent to the fact that @xmath186 is a _ simple _ curve only when @xmath293 .",
    "we now turn our attention to the case where @xmath342 .",
    "this time , the event @xmath313 means that the curve @xmath186 does hit the interval @xmath343 ( this clearly is interesting only when @xmath344 as otherwise this probability is @xmath139 ) .",
    "the variable @xmath229 is now in @xmath345 .",
    "the boundary condition at @xmath346 is again that @xmath347 . we therefore get that for @xmath348 ,",
    "@xmath349 where @xmath350 .",
    "we see that we have this time a problem when @xmath291 because the integral diverges at infinity .",
    "this corresponds to the fact that in this case , the curve is space - filling and hits almost the point @xmath59 before @xmath66 , so that @xmath351 is always @xmath61 .",
    "otherwise , the previous formula for @xmath328 holds .",
    "it is easy to note that @xmath352 only when @xmath353 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath354 , then it means that @xmath355 a simple change of variables ( write @xmath356 ) shows that the right - hand side is equal to @xmath357 .",
    "hence , this identity holds if and only if @xmath353 .    on the other hand , we know a priori that for discrete percolation in the upper half - plane in the triangular latticem , the probability of a white crossing from @xmath336 $ ] to @xmath358 is @xmath359 ( because the complement of this event is the existence of a closed crossing from @xmath360 $ ] to @xmath361 which has the same probability by symmetry )",
    "hence , sle@xmath286 is the unique possible scaling limit of critical percolation interfaces .",
    "the formula for @xmath328 in this case is known as cardy s formula .",
    "smirnov @xcite has in fact proved that on the triangular lattice , the crossing probabilities indeed converges to @xmath328 in the scaling limit .",
    "this , together with the construction of the measure @xmath238 in the previous section as outer boundaries of percolation clusters in the scaling limit , suggest that there is a direct relation between sle@xmath286 and the measure @xmath238 ( and this is indeed the case and it can be shown directly using sle@xmath286 s locality property and the ideas developped in @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , sle@xmath287 , which is conjectured to be the scaling limit of self - avoiding walks ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) is also directly related to the measure @xmath238 .",
    "this is why sle computations for @xmath362 and @xmath353 lead to information about the measure @xmath12 on self - avoiding loops ( dimension and multifractal spectrum of harmonic measure for these curves etc ) .",
    "in the second section / lecture , we were interested in measures supported on the set of ( single ) loops in the plane , motivated by the discrete measures on loops introduced at the beginning .",
    "we have identified the unique possible scaling limit of these measures , under the ( sometimes proved ) conformal invariance conjecture .",
    "this measure corresponds in the physics literature to models with `` zero central charge '' ( this uses vocabulary from the closely related representation theory ) .",
    "this means that the probabilistic objects that one considers `` do not feel the boundary '' of the domain that they live in .",
    "we now wish to understand the possible scaling limits of the probability measures on configurations for the @xmath0 models . in the present section",
    ", we shall define a `` conformal markov property '' that they should satisfy .",
    "then , we will identify and describe the probability measures that do possess this property .",
    "this part is based on joint ongoing work with scott sheffield @xcite ( that uses ideas and results from @xcite on loop - soup clusters and @xcite on the gaussian free field ) .",
    "let us fix a simply connected domain @xmath58 , say that @xmath58 is equal to the unit disc @xmath141 .",
    "we say that a simple configuration of loops is a family @xmath363 of self - avoiding loops in @xmath58 such that @xmath364 is at most countable , the loops are disjoint , and no two loops are nested . in other words ,",
    "each point @xmath365 is either        consider a simply connected subset @xmath121 of @xmath58 .",
    "for convenience , suppose that @xmath366 .",
    "there are two types of loops in @xmath367 .",
    "those that stay in this smaller domain @xmath368 and those that do exit @xmath121 . we will call @xmath369 and @xmath370 the corresponding subsets of @xmath364 . in other words : @xmath371 we also define @xmath372 the random domain that is obtained by removing from @xmath121 all the interiors of the loops @xmath373 . in other words , for each @xmath374 that does intersect @xmath375 ( these are the loops filled in black in figure [ f13 ] ) , we remove all the interior of @xmath374 from @xmath121 . hence , the boundary of @xmath376 consists of points of @xmath241 and of points of the loops @xmath373 , but it contains no point that is inside of a loop .",
    "note that @xmath376 is a ( random ) domain that can have several connected components ( for instance if a loop @xmath374 goes in and out of @xmath121 several times ) and that the loops @xmath374 for @xmath377 are in the domain @xmath376 .",
    "suppose now that @xmath378 is the law of a random simple configuration of loops in the unit disc .",
    "assume that @xmath378 is invariant under any conformal transformation from @xmath141 onto itself .",
    "then it is possible to define a law @xmath125 on simple configurations of loops in a simply connected domain @xmath379 by taking the conformal image of @xmath378 . more generally , for each open domain @xmath58 in the complex plane , we define @xmath125 by taking independent such configurations in each of the connected components of @xmath58 .",
    "it is easy to check that indeed , if the scaling limit of an @xmath0 model exists and is conformally invariant , then the law of its outermost loops should satisfy this property . in particular ,",
    "if one considers the critical ising model on the triangular lattice , with @xmath383 boundary conditions ( i.e. all sites on @xmath241 are conditioned to have spin @xmath383 ) , then in the scaling limit , the outermost loops surrounding clusters of spin @xmath384 should be a cle .    for the fk configurations , one would have to concentrate on the critical fk measure with `` free '' boundary conditions , i.e. all edges touching the boundary of the discrete approximation of @xmath58 are declared to be closed .",
    "then , assuming conformal invariance , the scaling limit should satisfy a similar property , but this time , the loops are allowed to touch each other ( i.e. two loops can have `` touching points '' even if they are not allowed to cross ) .",
    "we will here restrict ourselves to the `` simple '' case .",
    "* almost surely , @xmath367 consists of an unbounded countable set of loops .",
    "this follows from the fact that the cardinal of @xmath364 and the cardinal of @xmath386 have the same law . * for each fixed point @xmath365 , @xmath229 is almost surely inside one loop of @xmath367 . to see this ,",
    "let us define the event @xmath39 that @xmath229 is surrounded by a loop .",
    "first , since @xmath367 is not always empty , conformal invariance implies that one can find @xmath121 with @xmath387 , such that with positive probability , there exists a loop surrounding @xmath229 in @xmath370 .",
    "suppose now that this is not the case , then the conditional probability of @xmath39 is still @xmath32 because one can start again in @xmath376 .",
    "this yields that @xmath388 .",
    "* the previous statement implies that almost surely , the inside of the loops have full lebesgue measure , and that the lebesgue measure of the set of points that are outside of all loops is zero .",
    "we are now going to describe how to ( try to ) define another cle out of two independent cles .",
    "suppose that @xmath389 and @xmath390 are two independent cles ( that do not necessarily have the same law ) .",
    "then , @xmath391 consists of a countable family of loops @xmath392 , but these loops are not disjoint : the loops of @xmath389 do intersect countably many loops of @xmath390 and vice - versa .",
    "we then define the connected components @xmath393 of the union of all these loops .",
    "maybe there are several disjoint such connected components . in this case",
    ", one defines their outer boundaries @xmath394 ( i.e. @xmath395 is the outer boundary of @xmath396 ) .",
    "this would be a set of disjoint loops , but they might be nested .",
    "so we finally keep only the outermost loops of this family in order to have a simple configuration of loops .",
    "it is then not difficult to see that :      this lemma shows that in some sense , the set of cle laws is a semi - group .",
    "any two cles can be combined into a `` sparser '' cle ( with larger loops ) .",
    "this raises for instance the questions of whether a given cle can itself be viewed as the `` sum '' of two independent cles with the same law .",
    "if so , then is any cle infinitely divisible ( `` can it be viewed as an infinite sum of infinitesimal cles ? '' ) ?",
    "if one starts to think about what such an infinitesimal cle might be , it turns out that it should be related to the infinite measure @xmath12 on self - avoiding loops that we have discussed in an earlier lecture .",
    "this leads to the following construction :    consider a positive constant @xmath99 , and fix the domain @xmath397 .",
    "define a poisson point process of loops with intensity @xmath398 ( recall that @xmath127 is @xmath12 restricted to those self - avoiding loops that stay in @xmath58 ) .",
    "this is a random countable ( and overlapping ) collection @xmath328 of self - avoiding loops @xmath399 in @xmath58 .",
    "its law is characterized by the following two facts ( if @xmath400 denotes the random number of loops of @xmath328 that belong to a collection @xmath39 of loops ) :    * for any two disjoint ( and measurable ) families of loops @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath400 and @xmath401 are independent . * for any ( measurable ) family of loops @xmath39 , @xmath400 is a poisson random variable with mean @xmath402 .",
    "it is easy to see ( using the additivity properties of poisson random variables ) that poisson point processes exist .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath403 and @xmath404 are two such independent poisson point processes associated to the constants @xmath99 and @xmath405 , then @xmath406 is a poisson point process associated to the constant @xmath407 .",
    "in fact , one can construct on the same probability space realizations @xmath403 of the poisson point processes for each @xmath408 in such a way that @xmath403 has intensity @xmath398 and @xmath409 for all @xmath410 .",
    "one way to think of this is that it rains loops in @xmath58 with intensity @xmath127 .",
    "@xmath403 is then the family of loops that did fall on @xmath58 before time @xmath99 .",
    "it is called the loop - soup with intensity @xmath99 in @xmath58 .",
    "it is almost the same as the brownian loop - soup constructed in @xcite , except that here , it `` rains '' self - avoiding loops instead of brownian loops .    when @xmath99 is large , the set of points in @xmath58 that is not surrounded by any of the loops of @xmath403 is almost surely empty : this follows rather easily from the scale - invariance of the measure @xmath12 : take a small @xmath411 and define @xmath412 . for each @xmath413 ,",
    "cover @xmath120 by a family @xmath414 of @xmath415 discs of radius @xmath416 .",
    "for each such disc @xmath25 , one can find at least @xmath21 concentric disjoint annuli of aspect ratio @xmath62 in @xmath417 .",
    "hence , for a positive constant @xmath222 , @xmath418 for large @xmath99 , @xmath419 . then , @xmath420 but , if we take @xmath99 large enough , this last quantity tends to zero as @xmath421 .",
    "hence ( for large @xmath99 ) almost surely , all points in @xmath120 ( and therefore also in @xmath58 ) are surrounded by a loop in the loop - soup .",
    "if we now consider the connected components of @xmath422 , this implies that for large @xmath99 , there is just one such connected component .        in order to prove this",
    ", one can couple the loop - soup with the following well - known fractal percolation model .",
    "( in fact , the proof is very close in spirit to that of the corresponding one for multi - scale poisson percolation in @xcite , chapter 8 . )",
    "consider the unit square @xmath336 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "for each @xmath21 , we will divide it into @xmath423 squares of side - length @xmath424 . to each such square @xmath34 ,",
    "associate a bernoulli random variable @xmath425 equal to one with probability @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that all @xmath425 s are independent",
    ". then , define @xmath426 ^ 2 \\setminus \\bigcup_{c \\ : \\",
    "x(c)=0 } c .\\ ] ]      this is the fractal percolation model introduced by mandelbrot in @xcite .",
    "it is very easy to see that the area of @xmath234 is almost surely zero as soon as @xmath427 .",
    "chayes , chayes and durrett @xcite have shown that this model exhibits a first - order phase transition : there exists a @xmath35 , such that for all @xmath428 , @xmath234 connects two opposite sides of the unit square with positive probability , whereas for all @xmath429 , the set is a.s .",
    "disconnected ( note that in fact , if @xmath430 , then @xmath234 is almost surely empty ",
    "one can just compare the process with a subcritical branching process ) .",
    "note that at the critical probability , @xmath234 still has non - trivial connected components .",
    "now , let us consider a loop - soup with intensity @xmath99 in the unit square .",
    "this is just the conformal image of the loop - soup in @xmath141 . for each loop",
    "@xmath431 , let @xmath432 denote its diameter , and define @xmath433 in such a way that @xmath434 . note that @xmath431 can intersect at most 4 different dyadic squares with side - length @xmath424 .",
    "we each dyadic square @xmath34 of side - length @xmath424 , we now define @xmath435 the variables @xmath436 are of course not independent : when @xmath34 and @xmath437 are adjacent and have the same side - length @xmath424 , then it can happen @xmath438 because a loop @xmath431 with @xmath439 intersects them both .",
    "but it is easy to see that they are positively correlated .",
    "in particular , this implies that it is possible to couple the family @xmath440 with a family of independent bernoulli random variables @xmath425 such that for each @xmath34 , @xmath441 almost surely , and @xmath442 .",
    "because of the scale - invariance of the poisson point process , we see that for some constant @xmath443 , @xmath444 for all @xmath34 ( the inequality is just due to the squares adjacent to the boundary of the unit square that play aslightly different role ) .",
    "hence , we see that the loop - soup percolation process is dominated by a mandelbrot - percolation model ( remove each square independently with probability @xmath445 ) .",
    "in other words , if instead of removing the loops , we remove the squares of the corresponding side - length that they intersect , we wtill remove less squares than in the corresponding fractal percolation model .",
    "when @xmath428 , we know that the remaining domains contains paths and loops with positive probability .",
    "hence , so does the complement of the filled loops , as soon as @xmath446 ( and this is certainly the case for very small @xmath99 ) .",
    "note that this argument in fact shows that for any @xmath41 , one can find @xmath99 small enough such that the probability that ( if one considers the loop - soup of intensity @xmath99 in the unit square ) , there exists a separating path from the top to the bottom of the square , that stays in the middle - strip @xmath447 \\times [ 0,1]$ ] is greater than @xmath448 .",
    "this can then be used to prove that for small @xmath99 , all clusters of loops are a.s . at positive distance from each other and from the boundary .    if we now consider a domain @xmath137 , and a loop - soup in @xmath58 for such a small @xmath99 .",
    "the family of loop - soup cluster outer boundaries are denoted by @xmath449 .",
    "then , for each open subset @xmath450 of @xmath121 , we see that conditionally on @xmath451 , the law of the loops @xmath452 that stay in @xmath450 is just that of a loop - soup in @xmath450 ( this is because of the poissonian nature of the loop - soup ) .",
    "since this is true for all @xmath450 and using the conformal invariance of the measure @xmath127 , one can deduce that in fact , the family @xmath367 is a cle .",
    "one just has to prove that at the critical value @xmath456 , one still has several loop - soup clusters .",
    "this can be proved in an analogous way as the corresponding result for mandelbrot percolation in @xcite .",
    "note that if @xmath457 and @xmath458 are chosen in such a way that @xmath459 . then , the cle defined for the loop - soup with intensity @xmath460 can be defined starting from two independent cles corresponding to loop - soups with intensity @xmath457 and @xmath458 just as defined in lemma [ l2 ] . hence , the conditions of this lemma are sometimes true ...      note that the scaling limit of @xmath0 models are not simple families of loops ( one allows nested ones ) . however ,",
    "if the scaling limit of the outermost loops in a domain exist and are conformally invariant , and are therefore a cle , then one can construct the scaling limits of the inner ones by iteratively define `` independent '' cles inside each of the outermost loops and so on .",
    "this defines a `` nested cle '' .",
    "the following is a very heuristic description of the rich ongoing work by oded schramm and scott sheffield , and by scott sheffield alone on the relation between sle and the gaussian free field .",
    "more details will be found in their upcoming papers @xcite .",
    "consider a simply connected domain @xmath58 in the plane such that @xmath379 .",
    "the gaussian free field @xmath367 in @xmath58 ( with dirichlet boundary condition ) is a gaussian process ( i.e. a gaussian vector in an infinite - dimensional space ) that can be viewed as a random generalized function @xmath461 in @xmath58 .",
    "it is not really a function because @xmath461 is not defined at points , but for each smooth compactly supported function @xmath462 in @xmath58 , @xmath463 is a centered gaussian random variable , with covariance @xmath464 where @xmath465 denotes the green s function in @xmath58 . since , @xmath466 , one can not make sense of @xmath467 ( which would then be @xmath468 ) .",
    "however , it is often useful to think of @xmath463 as a generalized gaussian function @xmath461 with covariance given by @xmath469 , so that @xmath470 the gaussian free field ( gff in short ) inherits conformal invariance properties from the conformal invariance of the green s function .",
    "one equivalent way to define things is to consider the hilbert space @xmath471 of generalized functions in @xmath58 with zero boundary conditions endowed with the norm @xmath472",
    "( i.e. the completion of some space of smooth functions with respect to this norm ) . then",
    ", @xmath367 is simply a gaussian process in this space such that the covariance of @xmath473 is @xmath474 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "then , clearly , the energy is conformally invariant i.e. @xmath475 .",
    "one important additional property of the gff is its `` markovian property '' .",
    "a basic version of this property follows rather directly from the properties of gaussian processes ( and the fact that in this gaussian spaces setup , independence and orthogonality are the same ) .",
    "suppose for instance that @xmath186 denotes a smooth deterministic loop ( or a simple curve joining two boundary points ) in @xmath58 .",
    "let @xmath476 and @xmath477 denote the two connected components of @xmath478 .",
    "one can decompose the space @xmath471 into three orthogonal subspaces of generalized functions :    * the spaces @xmath479 and @xmath480 of ( generalized ) functions in @xmath476 and @xmath477 with dirichlet boundary conditions on their boundaries . * the space @xmath481 of ( generalized )",
    "functions in @xmath58 , that are harmonic in @xmath476 , in @xmath477 and have dirichlet boundary conditions on @xmath241 .    in other words ,",
    "one decomposes @xmath461 into its value on @xmath186 ( extended in a harmonic way on the complement of @xmath186 ) and then the two contributions in @xmath476 and @xmath477 . for a gaussian free field ,",
    "these three generalized distributions are therefore independent . hence , if one conditions on the values @xmath482 of @xmath461 on ( an infinitesimal neighborhood of ) @xmath186 , then the field in @xmath476 and @xmath477 are conditionally independent and obtained by taking the sums of a gff in @xmath476 ( resp .",
    "@xmath477 ) with the harmonic extension of @xmath482 .    hence , the gff possesses both a conformal invariance property and a markovian type property .",

    "suppose that @xmath483 . then , consider the field @xmath78 obtained by taking the sum of a gff in @xmath248 with the deterministic harmonic function @xmath484 on @xmath248 that takes the boundary value @xmath116 on @xmath227 and @xmath139 on @xmath485 i.e. @xmath486 .",

    "if one chooses the height - gap @xmath116 well , then one can follow a `` cliff '' with height - gap @xmath116 from the origin to infinity .",
    "the proof of this result is far from obvious .",
    "an important step is to make sense of the markovian property for `` random curves that are defined by the field themselves '' that schramm and sheffield call local sets of the gaussian free field ( instead of deterministic curves @xmath186 as in the last subsection ) .",

    "such a property has to be true along the cliff @xmath487 because the expected height of @xmath229 given @xmath502 $ ] would then be proportional to @xmath503 .",
    "this theorem shows that it is indeed possible to construct geometrically defined curves in a gff .",
    "in fact , it turns out that one can not only define such `` flat cliffs '' but also cliffs with varying height ( depending on the winding of the curve ) that we shall not describe here .",

    "it is therefore natural to try to find cles in a gff .",

    "the simplest ones are the `` loop versions '' of the curves defined in the last theorem .",
    "intuitively , if one draws all the loops in a gff corresponding to cliffs between height @xmath139 ( on the outside of the loop ) and @xmath504 ( on the inside of the loop ) , the markovian property of the gff should imply that the obtained family of loops is a cle .    in @xcite",
