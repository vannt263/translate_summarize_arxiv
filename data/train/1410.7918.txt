    "new applications such as smart drug delivery and health monitoring give rise to the importance of molecular communication , a new paradigm for communication between nanomachines over a short ( nanoscale or microscale ) range . in molecular communication ,",
    "information is carried by molecules , rather than electrons or electromagnetic waves @xcite .",
    "several types of molecular communication have been considered , among them , diffusion based communication , which corresponds to traditional wireless communication@xcite , is of great interest , since it does not require any prior communication link infrastructure . in diffusion based communication , the transmitter nanomachine releases information molecules in the environment .",
    "these released molecules diffuse randomly until they hit the receiver nanomachine .",
    "@xcite , @xcite . due to the random nature of molecular propagation",
    ", diffusion based communication suffers from inter symbol interference ( isi ) .",
    "several solutions have been proposed to mitigate isi ( e.g. see @xcite ) . in @xcite , a new modulation technique , named molecular concentration shift keying ( mcsk ) ,",
    "is suggested . exploiting two types of molecules , while mcsk eliminates the interference from the last transmitted symbol and reduces the error probability , it suffers from interference due to earlier transmissions . a solution based on adding intelligence to receiver",
    "is suggested in @xcite . where the receiver stores the last decoded bits in memory to make an estimation of current interference level , and uses this estimation to adjust the threshold for decoding the current bit . in @xcite ,",
    "a linear and time invariant model is presented and the optimal receiver is derived , under this model . however , this receiver is too complex to be implemented in practice . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered a deterministic noiseless diffusion channel with memory , and proposed using different symbol durations to deal with isi by taking into account the channel binary concentration state .",
    "they then computed the channel capacity by adapting the shannon telegraph channel method . in this paper , we propose a simple transmitter which significantly reduces isi by adaptively adjusting transmission rates to stabilize the rate of molecules at the receiver , enabling the use of a simple fixed threshold receiver .",
    "to this end , the transmitter exploits memory to keep a partial transmission history , so that it can estimate the interference rate that will be experienced at the receiver side , in order to determine a proper diffusion rate for the current transmission .",
    "it is shown that the proposed transmitting protocol is near optimal by obtaining a tight lower bound on the error probability and comparing its performance with the lower bound .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : the system model is described in section [ sec : sysmod ] and the proposed transmitter is introduced in section [ sec : adapttrans ] . in section [",
    "sec : performance ] , performance bounds are obtained and it is shown that the proposed transmitter is near optimal , and finally , the paper is concluded in section [ sec : conclu ] . throughout this paper",
    "all the logarithms are in base @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the communication model described in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "transmission occurs in equal time slots @xmath1 , called the symbol duration .",
    "the input bit stream ( @xmath2 ) comprises of i.i.d . @xmath3",
    "rv s . at the beginning of each time slot @xmath4 ,",
    "a number of molecules is released by the transmitter that is approximated as poisson variable , i.e. , @xmath5 , where the rate @xmath6 is determined by the information that the transmitter wishes to transmit . in this work , in contrast to @xcite-@xcite , the transmitter is an intelligent device consisting of @xmath7 bits of memory , a transmission function , and a memory updating function , as shown in fig .",
    "[ transmodel ] .",
    "the transmitter produces @xmath6 based on the current information symbol @xmath8 and the @xmath7 bits that are stored in the memory .",
    "the receiver is as simple as possible , it is just a threshold decoder with a fixed threshold .",
    "so , all the intelligence is kept in the transmitter to make the receiver simple .",
    "we consider a diffusion based model for communication .",
    "that is , molecules are freely released in the fluid where they propagate via brownian motion .",
    "although highly random , brownian motion is always available , and has the advantage of zero energy propagation cost @xcite .",
    "the released molecules continuously diffuse until they hit the receiver , once they reach the receiver they will be absorbed and removed from the media .",
    "let us denote by @xmath9 $ ] the sequence of hitting probabilities in consecutive time slots , i.e. , @xmath10 is the probability that a released molecule at the beginning of the @xmath11-th time slot arrives at the receiver during the @xmath12-th time slot , @xmath13 . in the simple case of one dimensional brownian motion in a uniform medium",
    ", it is shown that the first arrival time follows an inverse gaussian distribution@xcite and the vector @xmath14 can be obtained easily ( related equations can be found in@xcite )",
    ". there may exist other uninvited sources of molecules of the same type as our information molecules , which are treated as noise , and is modeled by a poisson random variable with parameter @xmath15 .",
    "considering the channel characteristics just described , the channel output in each time slot is influenced by three factors :    input rate in the current time slot transmission ( @xmath6 ) ,    input rates of previous transmissions ( @xmath16 ) ,    the noise parameter @xmath15 .",
    "using the thinning property of poisson distribution and the fact that sum of independent poisson rv s is itself a poisson , the channel output is a poisson rv , and is found in @xcite as follows : @xmath17 where @xmath18 denotes the interference term at @xmath4th time slot .",
    "we say that the channel has memory @xmath19 if @xmath20",
    "consider a conventional ook ( on - off keying ) modulator , where the transmitter sends a constant rate of molecules for bit ` 1 ' and nothing for bit ` 0 ' .",
    "the performance of this modulator ( which is commonly used in most positive systems like optical communications ) is degraded in diffusion based channels due to the isi effect .",
    "this is due to the fact that the rate of received molecules at the destination depends not only on the current transmission , but also on previously transmitted bits ( or equivalently rates ) .",
    "2 shows a sample of the received rate of molecules at the destination .",
    "one can realize from this figure that a constant threshold decoder is not an optimal or near optimal solution for this channel . even though we are using only two diffusion rates at the transmitter for bits ` 0 ' and ` 1 ' ,",
    "the absorption rates at the receiver are not fixed .",
    "we now introduce our simple modulation : we use a constant threshold decoder at the receiver , but to avoid the isi problem mentioned above , we modify the ook strategy by adapting the current transmission rate to the expected value of interference at the receiver , i.e. , for transmitting bit ` 1 ' , we diffuse less molecules if we expect a high concentration of molecules at the receiver due to previous transmissions ; for bit ` 0 ' , we send nothing .        to achieve the expected absorption rate of molecules at the receiver , the transmitter needs infinite bits of memory to remember all previously transmitted symbols which affect the current transmission , in order to estimate the interference level at the receiver side , and hereby determine the rate of molecules that should be released in the current time slot for bit one . to make the suggested scheme practical , we need to adapt it to a limited memory system , in which only a few bits of memory is available . as a result , the transmitter can not estimate the exact value of the interference @xmath18 in eq .",
    "; however , we will see that limited memory systems reach a performance close to that of unlimited memory .",
    "suppose a transmitter with @xmath7 bits of memory is available .",
    "our proposed encoder uses the memory to store the last @xmath7 transmitted information bits , which indicates the transmitter s state .",
    "a typical transmission function can be considered as follows : a transmitting rate is assigned to each @xmath21 states of memory , such that if the current input bit is ` 1 ' , the rate corresponding to the state is selected for the transmission , and if the current input bit is ` 0 ' , nothing is transmitted .",
    "the proposed transmitter can be modeled as finite state machine with @xmath22 states .",

    "suppose only two bits of memory are available ( @xmath36 ) , and the last two transmitted bits are ` 1 ' which means we are in state @xmath28 , then we are sure that the last transmitted rate is either @xmath37 or @xmath38 each with probability @xmath39 , depending on whether the third earlier bit is zero or one respectively",

    "[ comp ] ) show that a limited memory transmitter with only two bits of memory can reach the performance of the unlimited memory transmitter , and the performance of our simple system is comparable to the system with memory at the receiver side introduced in @xcite , which is more complex . in section [",
    "sec : performance ] , we show that this transmission protocol is near optimal under certain assumptions .",
    "in this section , we are interested in evaluating the performance of proposed transmission protocol . to understand how well the proposed scheme performs , we need to compare its bit error probability with that of the transmitter with an optimal transmission function , i.e. , transmitter with minimum error probability .",
    "unfortunately , deriving the optimal transmission function by minimizing the error probability is not a simple task , particularly when we are dealing with fixed values of memory , since the decision on the transmitting rate in each time slot affects not only the current time slot , but also all following time slots , which makes the problem highly complicated . as a result",
    ", we provide a combination of partial results , insights and simulation to make a case for this modulation scheme .",
    "we first make an observation in subsection iv .",
    "a where we show that under a simplifying assumption the optimal transmission function matches the proposed one at all points in the real line except for possibly one point . in subsection iv .",
    "b we derive a lower bound on the error probability for the special case of channels with one symbol memory , and we will see that our system performance is close enough to the lower bound .",
