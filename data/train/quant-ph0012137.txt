    "charged particles moving in a quantum field is an old topic in electromagnetic radiation theory , plasma physics and quantum / atom optics .",
    "interesting features include the relation between quantum fluctuations and radiation reaction @xcite , and , for the case of uniformly accelerated detectors , thermal radiance in the detector ( known as the unruh effect @xcite ) . for relativistic particles",
    "there are also bremsstrahlung , synchrotron radiation , and pair creation .",
    "the motion of congruences of charged particles shows up in particle beam , plasma and nuclear ( e.g. heavy - ion collision ) physics .",
    "their collective or transport properties must be treated by additional statistical mechanical considerations beyond those applied to single particles .",
    "theoretically , since particle - field interaction is in principle described by quantum field theory , one may get the impression that ordinary field theoretic methods are both necessary and sufficient for the study of this problem .",
    "quantum field theory , in the way we usually learn it , is customarily formulated in the context of , and with special emphasis on , how to answer questions posed in particle physics . for example , the s matrix is constructed for calculating scattering amplitudes , a perturbation expansion ( e.g. feynman diagram techniques ) is used for theories with a small coupling constant ( e.g. , qed ) , and even the effective action is usually based on in - out ( schwinger - dewitt ) boundary conditions ( the vacuum persistence amplitude ) .",
    "but , when one wants to find the evolution equation of a particle one needs an in - in boundary condition and an initial value formulation of quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "this is the starting point for constructing theories describing the _ nonequilibrium dynamics _ of many - particle systems @xcite where both the statistical mechanics depicting the collective behavior of a congruence of particles as well as the statistical mechanical properties of interacting quantum field theory need to be included in our consideration @xcite .",
    "the relationship between the contrasting paradigms of particles and fields is at the heart of our inquiry .",
    "the concept of a particle is very different from that of a quantum field : a particle moving in real space can not be completely described by , say , a number representation in fock space , which underlies the second quantization formulation of canonical field theory . background field decomposition into a classical field and its quantum fluctuations",
    "is a useful scheme , where one can follow the development of the classical background field with influences from the quantum fluctuations .",
    "while these methods have been applied extensively to the semiclassical evolution of quantum fields , the classical picture of particle motion is still quite remote .",
    "the feynman path integral formulation ( for particles worldlines as opposed to fields ) makes it easier to introduce classical particle trajectories as the path giving the extremal contribution to the quantum action , the stationary phase defining one condition of classicality .",
    "one can then add on radiative corrections by carrying out the loop expansion .",
    "this approach puts a natural emphasis on particle trajectories rather than scattering amplitudes between momentum eigenstates . but how does one go further to incorporate or explain stochastic behavior of the particle ? we shall see that when the coupling between the particle and the field is non - negligible , backreaction of the field ( with all its activities such as vacuum polarization , pair creation , etc . ) on the particle ( beyond simple radiative corrections ) imparts stochastic components to its classical trajectory .    at a deeper level , which we will tend to in the next series of papers , even a simple quest to understand",
    "the detailed behavior of quantum relativistic trajectories ( i.e. worldlines ) is a complex challenge , with problems connected with many central issues of quantum physics .",
    "for example , understanding how a particle moves through time ( or more accurately , how a property that can be recognized as time emerges for a single particle ) provides technical and conceptual insights into the larger questions concerning the nature of time in general .",
    "here we focus on the regime where the notion of trajectory and particle identity is well - defined- this implies that both particle creation / annihilation and quantum exchange statistics ( e.g. fermi exclusion or bose condensation effects ) are of negligible importance",
    ".    is there a unified framework to account for all these aspects of the problem ? this is what we strive to develop in this series of papers .",
    "we see from the above cursory queries that to address this deceptively simple problem in its full complexity one can not simply apply the standard textbook recipes of quantum field theory .",
    "even a `` simple '' problem such as particles moving in a quantum field , when full backreaction is mandated , involves new ways of conceptualization and formulation . in terms of new conceptualization",
    ", it requires an understanding of the relation of quantum , stochastic , classical ( as ingrained in the process of decoherence ) behaviors , and of the manifestation of statistical mechanical properties of particles and fields , in addressing where dissipation and fluctuations arise and how the correlations of the quantum field enter . in terms of new formulation , it involves the adaptation of the open - systems concepts and techniques in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics , and an initial value ( in - in ) path integral formulation of quantum field ( and quantized worldline ) theory for deriving the evolution equations .",
    "we will discuss these two aspects to highlight the basic issues involved in this problem .    in this investigation",
    "we take a microscopic view , using quantum field theory as the starting point .",
    "this is in variance to , say , starting at the stochastic level with a phenomenological noise term often - times put in by hand in the langevin equation .",
    "we want to give a first - principles derivation of moving particles interacting with a quantum field from an open - systems perspective .",
    "a consequence of coarse - graining the environment ( quantum field ) is the appearance of noise which is instrumental to the decoherence of the system and the emergence of a classical particle picture . at the semiclassical level , where a classical particle is treated self - consistently with backreaction from the quantum field , an equation of motion for the _ mean _ coordinates of the particle trajectory",
    "is obtained .",
    "this is identical in form to the classical equations of motion for the particle since higher - order quantum effects , which arise when there are nonlinear interactions , are suppressed by decoherence .",
    "backreaction of radiation emitted by the particle on the particle itself is called _",
    "radiation reaction_. for the special case of uniform acceleration it is equal to zero . this well - known , but at first - sight surprising , result is consistent owing to the interplay of the so - called acceleration field and radiation field @xcite .",
    "radiation reaction ( rr ) is often regarded as balanced by _ vacuum fluctuations _",
    "( vf ) via a fluctuation dissipation relation ( fdr ) .",
    "this leads to a common misconception : rr exists already at the classical level , whereas vf is of quantum nature .",
    "there is , as we shall see in this paper , nonetheless a fdr at work balancing quantum dissipation ( the part which is over and above the classical radiation reaction ) and vacuum fluctuations .",
    "but it first appears only at the stochastic - level , when self consistent backreaction of the _ fluctuations _ in the quantum field is included in our consideration .",
    "in addition to providing a source for decoherence in the quantum system making it possible to give a classical description such as particle trajectories , fluctuations in the quantum field are also responsible for the added _ dissipation _ ( beyond the classical rr ) , and a stochastic component in the particle trajectory ( beyond the mean ) .",
    "their balance is embodied in a set of generalized fluctuation - dissipation relations , the precise conditions for their existence we will demonstrate in this paper .",
    "ultimately a satisfactory description of the particle - field system would have to come from a full quantum theory treatment .",
    "one needs to stipulate and demonstrate clearly what successive approximations one introduces to some larger interacting quantum system will enable us to begin to see the precursor or progenitor of the particle , and the residual or background quantum field , depicted so simply in the end as the particle - field system in the conventional field theory idiom .",
    "the imprint of the particle s motion is left in the altered correlations of the quantum field @xcite .",
    "later we shall see that while the problem of the nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of relativistic particles ( or fields ) is important in its own right ; the rich physics contained is also closely connected with other problems of fundamental significance such as quantum gravity and string theory , including semiclassical gravity and quantum fields in black hole and early universe spacetimes .",
    "the remainder of this introduction summarizes the main ideas in this work and places it in the diverse range of prior research on this subject matter .",
    "we try to present a viewpoint and method which may provide a comprehensive and unified account while pointing out specific areas requiring further attention .",
    "our treatment in this first series emphasizes the semiclassical level and stochastic regimes .",
    "our approach is sharply distinguished from the case where the motion of the particle is prescribed , i.e. , a stipulated trajectory , that is characteristic of many treatments of ` particle - detectors ' in quantum fields . here",
    ", the trajectory is determined by the quantum field in a self - consistent manner . in the former case",
    ", there is a tacit presence of an agent which supplies the energy to keep the trajectory on a prescribed course , its effect showing up in the radiation given off by a detector / particle undergoing , say , acceleration .",
    "the field configuration would have to adjust to this prescribed particle motion accordingly , without affecting the particle motion . in the latter case ,",
    "the only source of energy sustaining the particle s motion arises from the quantum field , and both the field and particle adjust to each other in a self - consistent manner .",
    "the former case has been treated in detail by raval , hu , and anglin ( rha ) @xcite ( see references therein for prior work ) using the concept of quantum open - systems and the influence functional technique .",
    "we investigate the second class of problems now with the same open - system methodology .",
    "a closed quantum system can be partitioned into several subsystems according to the relevant physical scales .",
    "if one is interested in the details of one such subsystem , call it the distinguished ( relevant ) system , and decides to ignore certain details of the other subsystems , comprising the environment , the distinguished subsystem is thereby rendered as an open - system @xcite .",
    "the overall effect of the coarse - grained environment on the open - system can be captured by the influence functional technique of feynman and vernon @xcite , or the closely related closed - time - path effective action method of schwinger and keldysh @xcite .",
    "these are initial value formulations .",
    "for the model of particle - field interactions we study , this approach yields an exact , nonlocal , coarse - grained effective action ( cgea ) for the particle motion @xcite .",
    "the cgea may be used to treat the complete quantum dynamics of interacting particles . however , only when the particle trajectory becomes largely well - defined ( with some degree of stochasticity caused by noise ) as a result of effective decoherence due to interactions with the field can the cgea be meaningfully transcribed into a stochastic effective action , describing stochastic particle motion @xcite .",
    "the effect of the environment ( the coarse - grained subsystems ) on the system ( the distinguished subsystem ) is known as backreaction .",
    "one form of classical backreaction in the context of a moving charged particle in a quantum field is radiation reaction which exerts a damping effect on the particle motion . as remarked before",
    ", it should not be mistaken to be balanced directly by an fdr with vacuum fluctuations of the quantum field .",
    "the latter induce quantum dissipation and are instrumental to decohering the classical particle .",
    "let us now further examine the role of dissipation , fluctuations , noise , decoherence @xcite and the relation between quantum , stochastic and classical behavior @xcite .",
    "decoherence or dephasing refers to the loss of phase coherence in the quantum open system arising from the interaction of the systems with the environment .",
    "effective decoherence brings about the emergence of classical behavior in the system which generally carries also stochastic features .",
    "under certain conditions quantum fluctuations in the environment act effectively as a classical stochastic source , or noise .",
    "while noise in the environment is instrumental in decoherence , decoherence is a necessary condition for the appearance of a classical trajectory . in this emergent picture of the quantum to classical transition",
    ", there is always some degree of resultant stochasticity in the system dynamics @xcite .",
    "when sufficiently coarse - grained descriptions of the microscopic degrees of freedom are considered , nearly complete decoherence leads to negligible noise , and the classical description of the world is complete . moving back from classicality towards a description of more finely - grained histories ,",
    "the quantum effects suppressed by decoherence on macroscopic scales reveal themselves in the emergence of stochasticity . in this realm ,",
    "decoherence , noise , dissipation , particle creation , and backreaction are seen as aspects of the same basic quantum - open - system processes @xcite . if ` minimal ' additional smearing is not adequate to decohere the particle trajectories , the stochastic limit is not physically meaningful because the quantum interference between particle histories continues to play a significant role . even without a field s presence as an environment ,",
    "the particle s own quantum fluctuations ( represented by its higher order correlation functions ) may be treated as an effective environment for the lower - order particle correlation functions ( particularly the mean trajectories ) , so that a stochastic regime may still be realized when appropriately coarse - grained histories are considered @xcite . when averaged descriptions are considered such that the coarse - grained set of histories has substantial inertia , the quantum - fluctuation induced noise is negligible , and one moves from the stochastic to semiclassical domains .",
    "note that there is now growing recognition that the transition from quantum to classical behavior @xcite is characterized by a rich diversity of scales and phenomena , and it should therefore not be thought of as a single transition , but rather a succession of regimes that may , or may not , be well - separated in practice @xcite .    the view of the emergence of semiclassical solutions as decoherent histories @xcite also suggests a new way to look at the radiation - reaction problem for charged particles .",
    "the classical equations of motion with backreaction are known as the abraham - lorentz - dirac ( ald ) equations @xcite .",
    "the solutions to the ald equations have prompted a long history of controversy due to such puzzling features as pre - accelerations , runaways , non - uniqueness of solutions , and the need for non - newtonian initial data @xcite .",
    "it has long been felt that the resolution of these problems must lie in quantum theory .",
    "but , this still leaves open the questions of when , if ever , the abraham - lorentz - dirac equation appropriately characterizes the classical limit of particle backreaction ; how the classical limit emerges ; and what imprints the correlations of the quantum field environment leave .",
    "we show that these questions , and the traditional paradoxes , both technical and conceptual , can be resolved in the context of the initial value quantum open system approach .    indeed ,",
    "since every possible fine - grained history is included in the path integral for the quantum evolution , there is no a priori reason to reject fine - grained runaway solutions as unphysical , nor is there any sense in which a particular fine - grained history pre - accelerates , since the fine - grained paths that appear in the path integral are nt causally determined by earlier events in any case . from this perspective , the appropriate questions to address are , which ` quasi - classical ' coarse - grained solutions decohere more readily .",
    "certainly it would be strange if runaway ( or pre - accelerating ) decoherent coarse - grained histories occurred with any appreciable associated probability .",
    "so the question that should be asked , in the context of how classical solutions arise from the quantum realm , is whether decohered particle - histories are 1 ) solutions to the ald equation , 2 ) unique and runaway free , and 3 ) without preacceleration on scales larger than the coarse - graining scale at which the trajectories decohere .",
    "we shall see that , in fact , the semiclassical solutions do satisfy these criteria , and therefore , one is entirely justified in using the ald equation in the classical limit .",
    "one also sees that because this approach describes coarse - grained histories , the ald equation as an approximation fails in the finest - grained quantum limit .",
    "therefore , a fundamental understanding of the stochastic and semiclassical limits must be set in the context of the full quantum theory of particles and fields . in the second series of papers",
    ", we further develop the worldline plus field framework to describe fully quantized relativistic particles in motion through spacetime interacting with quantum fields and highlight its semiclassical , stochastic and quantum features .",
    "this framework for understanding relativistic systems is important because , in the nonequilibrium dynamics of real particles , the localized nature of the particle state is a prominent characteristic of the semiclassical limit , and this fact is not most naturally described by the usual perturbative field theory in momentum space .",
    "furthermore , interaction , correlation , measurement and decoherence invariably take place in both space and time .",
    "the incorrect treatment of `` measurement '' as an instantaneous occurrence leads to fundamental inconsistencies in the description of physical initial states which continues to be a substantial obstacle to a deeper understanding of decoherence and nonlocal correlation . for this reason , addressing the stochastic ( and quantum ) limits in a relativistic framework treating space and time covariantly is a vital element in fully understanding the stochastic - semiclassical limit . by developing a new framework for relativistic particle - field quantum dynamics",
    "we will show how this alternative approach provides powerful tools for addressing both conventional issues , and for exploring new questions .",
    "our problem , as well as many others from quantum and atom optics , provides a good example of where a quantum field ( e.g. photons ) acts as an environment in its influence on an atom or electron system .",
    "there are , of course , physical contexts for which it is more appropriate to coarse - grain the particle degrees of freedom , whereby one obtains a coarse - grained effective action for the field . in this complementary view",
    ", matter plays the role of an environment for the field as a system .",
    "when both particle and field coarse - grainings converge to mutually decoherent sets of particle and field histories , one recovers the classical limit @xcite .",
    "these regimes are illustrated schematically in figure 1 , where the field degrees of freedom are denoted by @xmath0 and the particle degrees of freedom are denoted by @xmath1      comparing with prior work on this subject matter using the same approach , the most closely related being that of raval , hu and anglin @xcite , who derived the influence functional for n - detectors moving in a quantum field , the main distinct feature here is that the particle trajectory is not prescribed , but is a dynamical degree of freedom determined self - consistently by the field .",
    "as such the coupling between the particle(s ) and the field is of a more fundamental nonlinear nature .",
    "one type of nonlinear coupling between the system and the environment in the quantum brownian motion models @xcite has been considered by hu , paz , and zhang @xcite .",
    "their model contains nonlinear couplings that are polynomial in the field variables , whereas here we consider the opposite example , where the field variables are linear , but the system variables are not .",
    "this is the case for qed , which is our ultimate goal ( to be discussed in paper iii @xcite of this series ) .",
    "our treatment of nonlinear particle - field interactions is in sharp contrast with the existing body of work on the semiclassical and stochastic limit for linear qbm .",
    "we find that the requirement of self - consistency , together with the nonlinearity of the fundamental interactions , leads to a description of the stochastic limit that is more unified and tightly constrained than that which has been described up to now .",
    "in fact , confronting nonlinear systems is a crucial next step in exploring the stochastic limit , and the deeper relationship between noise , decoherence , and the intricate evolution of correlations for systems with many degrees of freedom .",
    "most studies of decoherence have invoked linear systems with an ( externally ) predetermined basis of states which are then shown to decohere . but a complete description of decoherence must include the mechanism by which a decoherent basis of states is self - consistently ( e.g. not externally ) selected . understanding this mechanism as a dynamical feature of nonlinear theories is an important problem that can not be fully addressed within linear models .",
    "another important difference between linear and nonlinear theories is in their respective equations of motion for correlation functions . for linear theories ,",
    "these are just given by the classical equations of motion , and the quantum _ evolution _ may be reproduced by a probabilistic description of initial conditions .",
    "an example of this is the wigner function evolution for linear systems with initially positive definite distributions in phase spaces .",
    "the equations of motion are then the classical ones , and negative values of the wigner function never evolve in the future .",
    "one may then view the theory as dynamically equivalent to classical statistical dynamics ( though of course the _ meaning _ of the wigner functions is still quantum @xcite ) .",
    "this fact is what makes the construction of a stochastic limit that bridges linear classical and quantum theories fairly straightforward .",
    "the same is not true of nonlinear theories .",
    "their quantum equations of motion ( even for the mean - field ) are not equivalent to the classical ones .",
    "this implies that there are important _ qualitative _ differences in the quantum dynamics of linear versus nonlinear theories that are significant even in the semiclassical regime , and that will be missed by the study of linear systems alone .",
    "the important result in this first paper is the derivation of self - consistent langevin equations for relativistic particle motion in a quantum field starting from relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "a stochastic description of the limit of nonlinear theories requires great care , and , in its most general form , will involve nonlinear stochastic differential equations where the statistics of the induced particle fluctuations are _ externally _ determined by the quantum statistics of the fields .    because there are inherent dangers in a phenomenological approach to nonlinear stochastic equations , it is crucial to work from first principles stressing the microscopic origin of fluctuations . in this work ,",
    "we treat an example of a nonlinear stochastic system in the regime where decoherence allows the expansion around the semiclassical solution .",
    "the decoherent semiclassical solutions need not , and usually are not , equilibrium solutions .",
    "hence , compared with the traditional derivation of the langevin equations in the context of near - equilibrium linear response theory , this method is significantly more general .    for langevin equations the effect of the field",
    "is registered in the stochastic properties of the particles .",
    "the stochastic mean of the equations of motion corresponds to the mean - field semi - classical limit ; but in addition , the symmetrized n - point correlation functions for the particles are given by the higher order stochastic moments .",
    "therefore , the stochastic particles may be thought of as being `` dressed '' by the non - local statistics of the field .",
    "these equations impart stochastic features to the particle and field properties beyond the semiclassical limit , leading towards the quantum domain .",
    "the stochastic equations of motion featuring nonlocal noise , causal particle - particle interactions , and nonlocal particle - particle correlations make the evolution highly non - markovian ( i.e. history dependent ) . only in the single particle semiclassical limit ( with local dissipation and white noise ) is the evolution strictly markovian .",
    "for well separated particles , in the high temperature limit , the langevin equations may be approximated by markovian dynamics ; this is the regime in which the nonlocal role of the quantum vacuum has been essentially washed out . but as one moves more deeply into the stochastic regime ( especially at low temperatures ) , the markovian approximation is no longer adequate .",
    "it is in this realm that our methods are markedly distinct from the hamiltonian methods more commonly used in the derivation of markovian master equations .",
    "the treatment of a quantum field as a bath of harmonic oscillators has a long history .",
    "many authors take a semi - phenomenological approach in adding a noise to the quantum equation of motion by hand to get the quantum langevin equations ( qle ) .",
    "this practice works reasonably well in the linear response regime for a system in equilibrium , but can otherwise violate the fluctuation - dissipation relation and bring about pathologies ( such as a - causal evolution ) .",
    "there are many ways to derive the qle describing the dissipative dynamics of a quantum system in contact with a quantum environment , such as modified ( heisenberg picture ) hamilton equations of motion or path integrals .",
    "caldeira and leggett s revival of the feynman - vernon influence functional in the study of quantum brownian motion ( qbm ) has led to an extensive literature on qbm @xcite , particularly in regard to decoherence @xcite .",
    "ford , lewis , and oconnell have done systematic and comprehensive work on the problem of charge motion in an electromagnetic field as a thermal bath in the linear ( dipole coupling ) regime @xcite .",
    "they have detailed the conditions for causality and a good thermodynamic limit , and have further used the qle paradigm to find stochastic equations of motion for non - relativistic charged particles in the equilibrium limit .",
    "a crucial point of their analysis is that the solutions can be ( depending on the cutoff of the field spectral density ) runaway free and causal in the late - time limit @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", they suggest a form of the equations of motion that give fluctuations without dissipation for a free electron , but this result arises from the particular choice they made of a field cutoff .",
    "in contrast , we take the effective theory point of view which emphasizes the typical insensitivity of low - energy phenomena to unobserved high - energy structure .",
    "the following two papers in this series make clear that a special value for the cutoff is unnecessary for consistency of the low - energy behavior .",
    "further distinctions are briefed as follows : first , our general method extends to the nonequilibrium regime , allowing consideration of specific initial states at a finite time in the past .",
    "second , we do not make the dipole approximation ab initio because we are especially interested in the nonequilibrium dynamics of nonlinear systems .",
    "when our equations of motion are linearized , we pay special attention to the constraints that the original nonlinear theory imposes .",
    "third , by adopting the worldline quantization framework , we are able to derive equations of motion from fully relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "fourth , we highlight the role of decoherence in the emergence of a stochastic regime .",
    "fifth , we show how nonlocality may still be a feature in the stochastic regime , unless sufficient noise washes out the nonlocal correlations between separate particles .",
    "our results also represent an extension of barone and caldeira s analysis of decoherence for an electron in an quantum electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "their work employs the path integral method except they are limited to non - relativistic particles and dipole coupling , and it focuses mainly on the reduced density matrix .",
    "rather we give a full description of the stochastic dynamics of this nonlocal nonlinear theory .",
    "an advantage of barone and caldeira s work is that it is not limited to initially factorized states ; they use the preparation functional method which allows the inclusion of initial particle field correlations . despite this , romero and paz have pointed out that the preparation function method still suffers from an unphysical depiction of the initial state @xcite . for this reason , a completely satisfactory treatment of particle decoherence in a field - environment that accounts for particle - field correlations in more realistic ( i.e. physically prepared )",
    "states remains to be given .",
    "using the influence functional , disi @xcite derives a markovian master equation in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "in contrast , it is our intent to emphasize the non - markovian and nonequilibrium regimes with special attention paid to self - consistency .",
    "the work of @xcite differs from ours in the treatment of the influence functional as a functional of particle trajectories in the relativistic worldline quantization framework .",
    "ford has considered the loss of electron coherence from vacuum fluctuation induced noise with the same noise kernel that we employ @xcite .",
    "however , his application concerns the case of fixed or predetermined trajectories .      in section 2 , we begin with a review on how a quantum field can be treated as a bath of harmonic oscillators and",
    "we connect with the well - studied quantum brownian motion model ( qbm ) and quantum langevin equations ( qle ) @xcite .",
    "we write down the form of the influence functional ( if ) for nonlinear particle - field interactions , and we further review the influence functional formalism in appendix a , where we discuss the necessary assumptions for deriving an evolution propagator for the kind of hybrid particle / field model that we employ . underlying the formulation in appendix a is the worldline quantization method for relativistic particles where the particle coordinate is the relevant particle degree of freedom .",
    "use of this framework , rather than the conventional quantum field description for the charged particles , is central to this work .",
    "however , the detailed development of this approach is not needed for the semiclassical and stochastic regimes considered in this first series .    in sec .",
    "3 , we derive the coarse - grained effective action ( cgea ) .",
    "the background material in our approach consists of the schwinger - keldysh closed - time - path ( ctp ) effective action applied to an open system , which results in a ctp cgea that is closely related to the influence action in the feynman - vernon influence functional method . for easy access and identification of notations and conventions , we review these necessary formalisms in the appendices , which can be read independently .",
    "these techniques provide a general and powerful framework for studying nonequilibrium quantum processes , especially for non - markovian dynamics , which are prevalent when backreaction of the environment on the system is fully and correctly accounted for .",
    "we introduce the reduced - density - matrix for a system after assuming a system - environment partition .",
    "the reduced density matrix evolution operator is found in terms of the if , and the cgea . in sec . 4",
    ", we define the stochastic effective action , and show the close relationship of noise , dissipation , and decoherence in the stochastic limit . in sec . 5 , we discuss stochastic fields .",
    "6 presents a general ( i.e. , not restricted to a specific model of the particles or field ) derivation of the stochastic equations in the form of nonlinear langevin equations for general nonlinear particle - field coupling .",
    "we discuss when the traditional linear langevin equations may be recovered . in sec .",
    "7 we derive a generalized fluctuation - dissipation relation for the noise and radiation - reaction in these expressions .",
    "this provides the necessary framework of a stochastic theory approach to investigate relativistic particle motion in quantum fields .    in paper",
    "ii @xcite , we shall apply these results to a specific model of relativistic particles in a scalar field .",
    "we derive the influence functional and stochastic effective action for this nonlinear model , and then discuss in detail the semiclassical limit .",
    "the main result is the derivation of equations of motion for the semiclassical limit that , to lowest order , are modified ( time - dependent ) abraham - lorentz - dirac ( ald ) equations for charged - particle radiation reaction .",
    "this work demonstrates that the ald equation is a good approximation to the semiclassical limit of scalar qed , in the regime where the particles are effectively classical .",
    "this derivation is more general , however , and reveals the time - dependent renormalization and radiation - reaction typical of nonequilibrium quantum field theory .",
    "these features play a crucial role in establishing the consistency of this limit by showing that runaway solutions and acausal effects do not occur when the field is suitably regulated .",
    "we then derive ( time - dependent ) abraham - lorentz  dirac - langevin ( aldl ) equations , which describe the fluctuations ( and radiation reaction ) of relativistic particles in the stochastic limit .",
    "we use these results to explore the question of brownian motion for a free particle in a quantum scalar field .    in paper iii @xcite , we extend these results to the electromagnetic field by deriving the influence functional for qed in the lorentz gauge , from which we find the interacting photon - particle stochastic action . in the semiclassical limit",
    "we obtain a modified , time - dependent , ald solution for qed .",
    "we then demonstrate a direction dependent unruh effect with the vacuum fluctuations of the field appearing thermal ( at the unruh temperature ) for charged particles in a constant electric field .",
    "this general approach clearly illustrates the distinct natures of ald radiation reaction , the associated ordinary radiation into infinity , and the unruh effect , while at the same time deriving all these effects in a unified and self - consistent manner . as an interesting application",
    ", the langevin equation may be viewed as a model for a stochastic particle event horizon , with implications for a nonequilibrium treatment of black hole hawking radiation and horizon fluctuations .",
    "our second series of papers ( iv and v @xcite ) will be on relativistic quantum particle - field interaction .",
    "it is here that the pre - cursors of the quantized worldline framework introduced in appendix a are fully developed . in paper iv ,",
    "we ` first ' quantize the free relativistic particle using the path integral method .",
    "the worldline path integral representation is used to construct the `` in - out '' and `` in - in '' relativistic particle generating functional for worldline coordinate correlation functions . in paper",
    "v , we use the influence functional to construct an interacting quantum theory of both relativistic particles and fields .",
    "this involves the introduction of a nonlocal worldline kernel that provides a route for exploring the role of correlation , dissipation , and nonequilibrium open - system phenomena in particle creation and other relativistic processes .",
    "this work is also a model for how open - system methodology may be introduced into string theory since the worldline path integral is the point particle limit of the string case .",
    "this formalism provides a powerful approach to a new set of quantum - relativistic - statistical processes where one may simultaneously take advantage of the influence functional and first - quantization ( worldline ) techniques .",
    "we shall usually set @xmath2 , but keep @xmath3 explicit as a marker for quantum effects .",
