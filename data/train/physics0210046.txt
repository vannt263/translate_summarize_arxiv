    "this work is devoted to analytical study of ideal incompressible emhd flows ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein about emhd and its applications ) .",
    "our primary goal here is to consider a simplified 1d problem that has many similar qualitative properties with the problem about attractive interaction of two distributed currents in 2d ideal emhd , that was numerically simulated recently with a high resolution @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we introduce and partially analyse local approximations for particular class of the 2d ideal emhd flows , that are reduced in mathematical sense to dynamics of a single or few 1d objects , the vortex lines . the most interesting result of present work is the demonstration of exact solvability by the known hodograph method of long - scale dynamics in the unstable vortex structure constituted by two nearly anti - parallel sheets of the generalized vorticity in 2d ideal emhd .",
    "as known , the emhd model approximately describes dynamics of the low - inertial electron component of plasma in situations when the heavy ion component is almost motionless and serves just to provide a neutralizing background for electrically charged electron fluid and to keep a constant concentration @xmath0 of the electrons .",
    "the ( divergence - free in this case ) electric current @xmath1 creates the quasi - stationary magnetic field , @xmath2 which contributes to the generalized electron vorticity , @xmath3 the most simple way how to derive the ideal emhd equation of motion is just to use the well known fact that the generalized vorticity in an ideal homogeneous fluid is frozen - in , @xmath4.\\ ] ] as the result , the corresponding equation of motion can be represented in the remarkable form @xmath5,\\ ] ] where the hamiltonian functional of ideal incompressible emhd in the fourier representation is given by the expression @xmath6 here @xmath7 or @xmath8 depending on dimensionality of the problem and the electron inertial length @xmath9 is introduced .",
    "below we normalize all length scales to this quantity .",
    "our analytical approach is based on the representation of ideal emhd in terms of frozen - in lines of the generalized vorticity @xmath10 , as described , for instance , in @xcite . the general form ( [ omega_hamiltonian ] ) of equation of motion allows one to represent the field @xmath10 through the shapes of frozen - in vortex lines ( the so called formalism of vortex lines ) , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the 3d delta - function , @xmath13 is some fixed 2d manifold depending on the particular problem",
    ", @xmath14 is a label of vortex line , @xmath15 is an arbitrary longitudinal parameter along the line .",
    "dynamics of the line shape @xmath16 is determined by the variational principle @xmath17 , with the lagrangian of the form @xmath18\\cdot{{\\bf { d}}}({{\\bf { r}}}))d\\xi \\,\\ , -{\\cal h}\\{{{\\bf { \\omega}}}\\{{{\\bf { r}}}\\}\\},\\ ] ] where the vector function @xmath19 must satisfy the only relation @xmath20 below we take @xmath21 .",
    "now we apply this formalism to the 2d case , when the three - component field @xmath22 does not depend on the @xmath23-coordinate .",
    "the field @xmath24 can be parameterized by two scalar functions , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , @xmath27 because of the freezing - in property , the @xmath28-function is just transported by the @xmath29-component of the velocity field , that results in conservation of the integrals @xmath30 with arbitrary function @xmath31 .",
    "if initially @xmath32 was piecewise constant , then at any time we have a flow with cylindrical sheets of frozen - in generalized vorticity .",
    "each such cylinder is numbered by a number @xmath33 , has a constant in time value @xmath34 of the jump of @xmath35 , and consists of a family of closed ( if @xmath36 ) vortex lines with identical shape but with different shift along @xmath23-axis , @xmath37 , where @xmath15 is a longitudinal parameter along a line , @xmath38 is the shift .",
    "obviously , the number @xmath39 together with the sift @xmath38 serve in this case as the 2d label @xmath40 .    for 2d ideal emhd in the physical space we have from eq.([emhd_hamiltonian ] ) the double integral @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the modified bessel function of the second kind .",
    "we do not write the exact coefficient in front of this expression since it only influences on a time scale and thus is not very interesting for us .    as follows from equations written above , dynamics of this set of contours in 2d ideal incompressible emhd",
    "is determined by the lagrangian @xmath43 where the new constants @xmath44 are proportional to the corresponding jumps of @xmath28 function , @xmath45 and so on .    for a given contour number , locally",
    ", a cartesian coordinate can be used as the longitudinal parameter , for instance , the @xmath46-coordinate . in this case",
    "the function @xmath47 plays the role of the canonical coordinate , while @xmath48 plays the role of the canonical momentum .",
    "thus , we have a `` natural '' system with the hamiltonian being the sum of a quadratic on the generalized momentum `` kinetic energy '' and a `` potential energy '' @xmath49 depending on the shape of the contours in @xmath29-plane , or , in other words , on the @xmath28 function . in emhd",
    "the `` potential energy '' describes the interaction between parallel electric currents .    ",
    "at this point it is interesting to compare the 2d emhd with the usual eulerian 2d hydrodynamics , which differs from ( [ h_2d_emhd ] ) by the @xmath50-function instead of the @xmath51-function . in that case",
    "@xmath28 function is just the @xmath23-component of the velocity field , and the `` potential energy '' @xmath49 is an integral of motion for eulerian 2d flows , as follows from the expression @xmath52 and from eq.([f_integrals ] ) with @xmath53 .",
    "equations of motion , that follow from the variational principle with the lagrangian like ( [ exact_lagrangian ] ) , but with `` @xmath54 '' instead of `` @xmath51 '' , are such that this term does not have influence on the contour dynamics in @xmath29-plane , only it adds a linear function of the time to @xmath55-coordinate of a vortex line .",
    "this property corresponds to conservation of the @xmath23-component of the velocity in 2d eulerian flows for each moving element of the fluid .",
    "obviously , in 2d emhd such conservation does not take place .    ",
    "for practical analytical calculations the system ( [ exact_lagrangian ] ) is not very convenient because of the non - locality .",
    "however , since the @xmath51-function is exponentially small at large values of its argument , it is possible to introduce local approximations for long - scale dynamics .",
    "let us first have a single contour of a large size @xmath56 .",
    "then for smooth configurations approximate local equations of motion ( with the time appropriately rescaled ) can be obtained by variating the expression @xmath57 which naturally arises after we perform one integration in the double integral in eq.([exact_lagrangian ] ) with ( almost ) straight shape of the adjacent piece ( a few units of @xmath58 ) of the contour .",
    "although for us this system seems to be very interesting and deserving much attention , now we concentrate on another case and consider unstable vortex structure constituted by two close contours .",
    "let us now consider the case of two contours with equal jumps @xmath59 , symmetric with respect to the line @xmath60 , and parameterize ( locally ) their shapes as @xmath61 and @xmath62 , as shown in fig.[sketch ] in the small frame .",
    "if a typical wave - length @xmath63 along the @xmath46-direction is large comparatively to both @xmath64 and @xmath65 , then in the long - scale localized approximation , with additional condition @xmath66 , we have from eq.([exact_lagrangian ] ) @xmath67[1-\\exp(-2y)]\\right\\}dx,\\ ] ] after an appropriate time rescaling we can put the `` const '' in the above expression equal to @xmath68 for convenience . then , after introducing new quantities @xmath69 and @xmath70 , as well as the function @xmath71 , @xmath72 it is possible to write down the corresponding equations of motion in the following remarkable general form , @xmath73 as known , any nonlinear system of such form can be locally reduced to a linear equation after taking as the new independent variables @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( the so called hodograph method ; see , e.g. , @xcite for a particular case ) . indeed ,",
    "since from ( [ mu_definition ] ) and ( [ bernoulli_general ] ) we see @xmath76 it is useful to introduce an auxiliary function @xmath77 as @xmath78 in order to obtain @xmath79 from here we easily derive @xmath80 after that we rewrite eq.([contin_general ] ) as @xmath81 and multiply it by the jacobian @xmath82 : @xmath83 thus , now we have @xmath84 differentiating this equation over @xmath74 with taking into account eqs.([t]-[x ] ) and subsequent simplifying give us the linear partial differential equation for the function @xmath85 : @xmath86 it is also useful to write down here the general equation for the function @xmath77 : @xmath87    thus , the localized approximation ( [ approx_lagrangian ] ) appears to be integrable in the sense that it is reduced to solution of a _ linear _ equation .",
    "however , the functions @xmath85 and @xmath88 are multi - valued in general case",
    ". therefore statement of the cauchy problem for the time evolution of the system [ originally the cauchy problem was formulated in @xmath89-representation in terms of initial functions @xmath90 and",
    "@xmath91 at @xmath92 now becomes much more complicated , since in @xmath93-plane initial data are placed on the parametrically given curve @xmath94 , @xmath95 which can have self - intersections .",
    "it should be noted here that for @xmath77 initial data are determined directly by eqs.([t]-[x ] ) , while for @xmath85 their determination needs additional differentiation of eq.([x ] ) over @xmath74 .    besides this , the particular function @xmath71 given by eq.([h_rm ] ) results in the _ elliptic _ partial differential equation for the function @xmath85 , @xmath96_{\\rho\\rho}+e^{-\\rho}[(1+\\mu^2)t]_{\\mu\\mu}=0,\\ ] ] in contrast to the usual 1d gas - dynamic case described in @xcite , where the corresponding equation is _",
    "hyperbolic_. generally speaking , the ellipticity makes the cauchy problem ill - posed in the mathematical sense , if the initial data are not very smooth .",
    "however , for sufficiently smooth initial data the problem remains correctly formulated though still difficult for complete solution .",
    "nevertheless , the linear equation seems to have an advantage , and we hope with its help to investigate more easily the problem of classification of possible singularities in this system . in the future work",
    "we will discuss how the quantity @xmath74 can tend to zero at some point @xmath46 .",
    "it should be also noted that an analogous approach is useful in studying another unstable vortex structure , the pair of anti - parallel vortex filaments in the usual hydrodynamics and in other hydrodynamic - type models @xcite ( the corresponding instability in eulerian hydrodynamics is known as the crow instability ) .",
    "for instance , if we consider nonlinear development of the crow instability in long - scale limit , then the localized approximation for symmetric ( respectively to the plane @xmath60 ) dynamics of the vortex pair gives us the hamiltonian @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the ( small ) width of the filaments .",
    "taking the @xmath46-coordinate as a longitudinal parameter @xmath15 , we have the system like ( [ mu_definition]-[bernoulli_general ] ) , but with @xmath99 , @xmath100 investigation of the corresponding linear equation for the function @xmath85 is now in progress .",
    "these investigations were supported by the intas ( grant no . 00 - 00292 ) , by rfbr ( grant no . 00 - 01 - 00929 ) , by the russian state program of support of the leading scientific schools ( grant no . 00 - 15 - 96007 ) , and by the science support foundation , russia ."
