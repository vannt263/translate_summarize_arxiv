    "in the past few years , the synthesis of ferromagnetic semiconductors has become a major challenge for spintronics .",
    "actually , growing a magnetic and semiconducting material could lead to promising advances like spin injection into non magnetic semiconductors , or electrical manipulation of carrier induced magnetism in magnetic semiconductors @xcite . up to now , major efforts have focused on diluted magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) in which the host semiconducting matrix is randomly substituted by transition metal ( tm ) ions such as mn , cr , ni , fe or co @xcite .",
    "however curie temperatures ( @xmath10 ) in dms remain rather low and tm concentrations must be drastically raised in order to increase @xmath10 up to room temperature .",

    "for semiconductors showing @xmath10 higher than room temperature one can foresee the fabrication of nanodevices such as memory nanodots , or nanochannels for spin injection .",
