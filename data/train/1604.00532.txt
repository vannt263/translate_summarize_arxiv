    "we can think e.g.  of a two - level spin undergoing a unitary phase shift @xmath3 . by subsequently interrogating the probe",

    "is termed heisenberg limit and incarnates the _ holy grail _ of quantum metrology @xcite .    in practice",
    ", the unitary dynamics of the probe will be distorted by noise , due to unavoidable interactions with its surroundings .",
    "unfortunately , the metrological advantage of entangled probes over separable ones vanishes for most types of uncorrelated noise , such as spontaneous emission , depolarizing noise @xcite , or phase damping @xcite .",
    "entanglement may remain advantageous though , provided one gains precise control over the noise strength , and only for limited cases such as time - inhomogeneous phase - covariant noise @xcite , transversal noise @xcite , or when error - correction protocols may be used @xcite .",
    "creating entangled states with a large number of particles is anyhow a costly process , limited by technological constraints @xcite .",
    "furthermore , to fully harness the metrological power of entanglement in presence of noise , collective measurements on all @xmath1 probes at the output would be generally required @xcite .",
    "this contrasts with the noiseless scenario , in which separable measurements ( i.e. , performed locally on each probe ) suffice to attain the heisenberg scaling @xcite .",
    "one can try to circumvent these problems by devising an alternative _ sequential _ or ` multi - round ' strategy , in which the parameter - imprinting unitary acts @xmath1 consecutive times on a single probe before performing the final measurement . in absence of noise , this sequential setting is formally equivalent to the parallel one @xcite , the only difference being that quantum _ coherence _",
    "@xcite takes over the instrumental role of entanglement .",
    "the sequential scheme seems more appealing from a practical viewpoint , as only a single probe needs to be addressed in both state preparation and final interrogation @xcite .",
    "however , the heisenberg scaling of the precision can not be maintained asymptotically in the sequential scenario either , once again due to the detrimental effects of noise .",
    "given the severe limitations that environmental disturbance places on quantum - enhanced metrology , for practical purposes it seems best to give up the prospect of super - classical _ asymptotic _ scaling of the resolution and to concentrate instead in using the _ finite _ resources available as efficiently as possible .",
    "in this paper , we explore the optimization of phase estimation with a two - level probe , in the presence of _ unital phase - covariant _ noise . to that end , in sec .",
    "[ sec : noise ] we introduce a simple versatile model in which the noise is intrinsically accounted for : we take the generator @xmath10 of the phase shift to be partly unknown and sample instances of it from some probability distribution .",

    "sec : sens ] we calculate the _ quantum fisher information _ ( qfi ) @xmath11 @xcite , which can be meaningfully regarded as a quantitative benchmark for the optimal estimation sensitivity , and derive a close - fitting lower bound @xmath12 to it .",
    "both quantities grow quadratically for small @xmath1 , reach a maximum at some @xmath2 , and decay to zero as @xmath1 increases further .",
    "in particular , we obtain @xmath2 from @xmath13 in terms of parameters directly accessible via process tomography , giving a useful prescription for practical phase estimation with a large guaranteed sensitivity .",
    "we do this for any unital phase - covariant qubit channel , hence delivering results widely applicable to a broad range of relevant physical processes , including those in which noise effects of the depolarizing type are dominant , such as spin - lattice relaxation at room temperature .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : ex ] we then illustrate our results by choosing a specific distribution for the stochastic generator .",
    "we compare the qfi in the sequential setting ( with and without passive correlated ancillas ) with the actual phase sensitivity of given feasible measurements . for completeness",
    ", we also compute the qfi analytically in a parallel - entangled setting starting from an @xmath1-qubit ghz state .",
    "although the qfi exhibits an asymptotic linear scaling in @xmath8 in such setting , we find that entangled probes may provide no practical advantage when their interrogation is restricted to measurements of local observables on each individual qubit .",
    "in fact , in such case the sensitivity for the parallel - entangled strategy reduces to that of the sequential one , where the ` number of probes ' comes to play the role of the ` number of rounds ' .",
    "our analysis , summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : d ] , reveals feasible solutions for quantum metrology based on the little - studied sequential paradigm ( possibly supplemented by a passive ancilla ) , robust even under sizeable levels of noise .",
    "let us start by introducing our model for ease of illustration . in the sequential scenario ,",
    "a two - level probe undergoes a sequence of @xmath1 phase shifts @xmath14 before being interrogated .",
    "the generator can be written as @xmath15 , where the axis @xmath16 is sampled from some normalized probability distribution @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the vector of the three pauli matrices .",
    "thus the phase - imprinting operation @xmath19 , which transforms the probe state at each step , is @xmath20    the resulting qubit channel is completely positive , trace preserving , _ unital _",

    "( [ eq : channel ] ) is akin to the classical simulation method of ref .",
    "@xcite . without loss of generality",
    "we may take the average rotation axis @xmath23 proportional to @xmath24 , hence restricting to probability distributions @xmath25 with axial symmetry on the bloch sphere , so that our qubit channel @xmath26 is _ phase - covariant _ , as it commutes with @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "physically , we may think , for instance , of the free evolution of a nuclear spin with gyromagnetic ratio @xmath28 in an external magnetic field @xmath29 pointing along @xmath30 . in that case @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is some coarse - grained time resolution , of the same order as the thermal fluctuations of the environment .",
    "the interactions with the surrounding nuclei at large temperatures result in random changes of the net direction of the magnetic field on our spin .",
    "this gives rise to a relaxation process towards the thermal equilibrium state @xmath34 .",
    "if the direction of @xmath29 were kept fixed and the environmental effects were accounted for by a fluctuating magnetic field intensity @xmath35 , the model would realize pure dephasing instead @xcite , which is often dominant at short time scales .      while the model in eq .",
    "( [ eq : channel ] ) can be conveniently adopted as a physical example to focus our analysis , the results derived in this paper will hold for a more general class of channels , namely all the unital phase - covariant qubit channels , whose description is recalled here .    given a single - qubit state @xmath36 , any single - qubit channel maps the bloch vector @xmath37 into @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a @xmath40 real distortion matrix , and @xmath41 is a displacement vector . for the most general unital phase - covariant channel @xcite , @xmath42 and @xmath43",
    "these channels encode information about @xmath0 not only in the rotation of the bloch ball by a function @xmath44 , but also in its deformation , through the singular values of @xmath45 , namely @xmath46 and the doubly - degenerate @xmath47 , which must satisfy @xmath48 and @xmath49 ( implying @xmath50 ) for the map to be completely positive @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : phase_covariant ] ) thus generalizes the canonical phase - covariant channels like phase damping , for which @xmath51 @xcite . in what follows",
    "we shall work with the @xmath52 liouville representation @xmath53 , which acts on vectorizations @xmath54 of any density matrix @xmath55 in the computational basis as @xmath56 , where @xmath53 writes as @xmath57",
    "we will now analyze the sensitivity for estimating a phase imprinted by any unital phase - covariant qubit channel , starting with the sequential estimation setting . recall that the estimate @xmath58 is built by measuring some observable @xmath59 on the final state of the probe @xmath60 after @xmath8 successive applications of the channel .",
    "we can then gauge the phase sensitivity of @xmath59 as @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "in general , @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the _ classical _ fisher information of a projective measurement onto the eigenstates @xmath66 of the observable @xmath67 ( assumed non - degenerate ) @xcite . in particular , one can verify that equality holds for all the explicit examples presented later in the paper , henceforth we shall simply refer to @xmath68 as the phase sensitivity associated to the ( generally suboptimal ) observable @xmath69 .",
    "the qfi @xmath70 , which captures geometrically the rate of change of the evolved probe state @xmath71 under an infinitesimal variation of the parameter @xmath72 , corresponds to the classical fisher information of an _ optimal _ observable ( i.e. @xmath73 ) and is thus a meaningful benchmark for the best estimation protocol .",
    "such an optimal observable is diagonal in the eigenbasis of the symmetric logarithmic derivative ( sld ) @xmath74 , defined implicitly by @xcite @xmath75    note that the prominent role of the qfi @xmath11 in quantum estimation theory is well established in an asymptotic setting , by virtue of its appearance in the quantum cramr - rao bound , @xcite , @xmath76 , which becomes tight in the limit of a large number @xmath77 of independent repetitions .",
    "however , the qfi also enters in both the van trees inequality @xcite and the ziv - zakai bound @xcite , which can provide tighter and more versatile bounds on the mean - square error @xmath78 in the relevant case of finite @xmath79 ( including bayesian settings ) .",
    "therefore , we shall adopt the qfi as our main figure of merit , in keeping with the quantum metrology bulk literature ( see e.g.  @xcite for a recent discussion ) and in compliance with the spirit of this paper , which focuses on the use of finite resources to retain quantum enhancements in the estimation sensitivity .",
    "we will also assume maximization of @xmath70 over the initial state of the probe unless stated otherwise .    to calculate the qfi @xmath80 we make use of the formula @xmath81 where @xmath82 and @xmath83 are , respectively , the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath84 @xcite ( excluding terms with @xmath85 from the sum ) , and we have made the dependence of the qfi on @xmath72 and @xmath8 explicit . by preparing the probe in the optimal , maximally coherent state @xmath86 @xcite",
    ", we obtain exactly @xmath87 .",
    "\\label{eq : qfi_formula_general}\\ ] ]    the qfi thus grows as @xmath88 for small @xmath8 , reaches a peak at some @xmath2 , and then decays asymptotically to zero .",
    "a similar qualitative behaviour has been recently reported under other types of ( non - unital ) noise , such as erasure , spontaneous emission , and phase damping @xcite .      in order to optimize our sequential protocol",
    ", we need a practical way to determine @xmath2 . to that end , we aim to bound the qfi from below . in general , one may use @xmath89 @xcite , which is not necessarily tight . luckily , for the family of channels encompassed by our @xmath90 , a tighter bound @xmath91 stemming from @xmath92 , where @xmath93 stands for the operator norm , can be established ( see appendix  [ app : bound ] ) .",
    "concretely , we will thus define @xmath94 \\leq f_n(\\varphi ) , \\label{eq : bound_result}\\ ] ] which closely follows the behaviour of the qfi , as confirmed by our numerical analysis ( cf .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . maximizing @xmath95 yields @xmath96 ( rounded to the nearest integer and using natural logarithm ) .",

    "the maximum of @xmath95 is at @xmath102 , only one round further the actual maximum of @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath1 is discrete and the continuous lines are a guide to the eye .",
    "all the quantities plotted are dimensionless . ]",
    "it follows that there exist observables with a phase sensitivity of _ at least _",
    "@xmath95 , which could be made grow above @xmath104 by just running the sequential protocol for @xmath105 iterations .",
    "once the precision has been optimized at the single - probe level , it can be scaled - up `` classically '' by increasing the number of independent probes .",
    "we emphasize that eqs .   and apply _ generally _ to any phase - covariant channel preserving the identity .",
    "therefore , we have provided useful guidelines for precise phase estimation under a wide class of physically motivated noise models .",
    "to illustrate our results , we shall pick the von mises - fisher distribution @xcite @xmath106 for our random generator @xmath107 in eq .  .",
    "this distribution can be seen as the counterpart of a gaussian over the bloch sphere : it becomes uniform for @xmath108 ( i.e. @xmath109 is equally likely to point in any direction , as in a black - box scenario @xcite ) , whereas it localizes sharply around the @xmath110axis for @xmath111 . in appendices [ app : kraus ] and",
    "[ app : sequential ] , we provide an explicit operator - sum representation for this choice of @xmath90 , as well as expressions for the resultant @xmath53 , @xmath103 , and @xmath95 .",
    "recall that saturating the precision bound set by the qfi requires interrogating the probe in the eigenbasis of the sld .",
    "however , the sld basis usually depends explicitly on the unknown parameter @xmath0 ( and , in this case , on the noise parameter @xmath112 ) so that , in practice , one would need to implement adaptive feedforward estimation procedures @xcite , or could have to resort to sub - optimal phase - independent estimators @xmath59 .",
    "it is therefore particularly interesting to see how the sensitivity of _ accessible _ observables compares with the qfi .",
    "we can study , for instance , the phase sensitivity of @xmath113 or , equivalently , that of @xmath114 for any @xmath115 in the equatorial plane .",
    "explicit formulas are provided in appendix  [ app : sequential ] , and the resulting @xmath116 is plotted alongside @xmath103 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( dashed and solid curves , respectively ) .",
    "interestingly , as @xmath1 increases , the sensitivity of @xmath117 is seen to _ oscillate _ regularly between zero and the qfi .",
    "this can be intuitively understood if one thinks of the ` dynamics ' of @xmath84 in the bloch sphere : the maximally coherent preparation @xmath118 lies along the equator , on the bloch sphere surface .",
    "then , the iterative application of @xmath90 gives rise to a trajectory which inspirals on the equatorial plane as @xmath84 approaches its fixed point @xmath119 at the center of the sphere .",
    "this is just a combination of the unitary rotation around the @xmath110axis and the loss of purity that results from the average in eq .  .",
    "the eigenstates of the sld follow the rotation of @xmath84 , whereas our actual measurement basis remains fixed . as a result , the sensitivity of @xmath120 oscillates between @xmath121 and @xmath103 , with the latter saturated when the two bases coincide ( see appendix  [ app : sequential ] for a visual description ) .      as a comparison ,",
    "let us now consider the parallel - entangled strategy , i.e. , a single - round protocol starting from an entangled state of the @xmath1 qubits .",
    "we will choose the maximally - entangled ghz state @xmath122 @xcite as initial preparation .",
    "although this may not be optimal for noisy parameter estimation @xcite , it comes with the advantage that it keeps a simple form under the local application of our channel on all @xmath1 probes .",
    "it also has the same degree of quantum coherence as the single - qubit @xmath123 state , as measured by the @xmath124norm @xcite .",
    "this choice allows us to obtain an analytic expression for the qfi ( see appendix  [ app : parallel ] ) , which is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( dotted curve ) along with the qfi of the sequential case .",
    "note that , while we use the same notation ` @xmath1 ' for the number of rounds in the sequential case and for the number of probes in the parallel one , these are essentially different resources .",
    "one can nonetheless make sense of the comparison between the two metrological settings by invoking their formal equivalence in absence of noise @xcite , and by recalling that @xmath8 equals the overall number of interactions with the phase - imprinting channel in both cases .     for : the @xmath8-round sequential setting with a single - qubit initial state @xmath101 ( solid ) , the @xmath8-round sequential setting with a passive ancilla and two - qubit initial bell state ( dot - dashed ) , and the parallel - entangled setting with @xmath8-qubit initial ghz state ( dotted ) .",
    "the dashed line amounts to the phase sensitivity of @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 in each of the three settings , respectively .",
    "the model parameters are the same as in fig .",
    "all the quantities plotted are dimensionless . ]",
    "the resulting parallel qfi exhibits a linear asymptotic scaling with @xmath128 , unlike the sequential setting .",
    "however , even if such a large @xmath8-qubit entangled probe could be prepared , its maximum sensitivity would only be saturated by some phase - dependent _ collective _ measurement on all @xmath1 probes @xcite . indeed , in appendix",
    "[ app : parallel ] we show that this parallel qfi may be split into two contributions : one , with a profile similar to that of the sequential @xmath103 , stemming from the matrix elements of the output state in the subspace of total angular momentum @xmath129 , and another one , related to the complementary subspace , which depends on the phase @xmath0 through the longitudinal deformation parameter @xmath46 .",
    "it is precisely this second contribution which endows the probe with a linearly increasing sensitivity at large @xmath1 .",
    "it seems intuitively clear that singling out the relevant information contained in the subspace @xmath130 requires a collective estimator , such as @xmath131 itself .",
    "note that such coherent manipulations may be demanding to implement , or even unavailable in case the probes are transmitted to @xmath1 remote stations during the process .",
    "alternatively , one could ask about the performance of a collection of accessible _ separable _ measurements , such as @xmath132 , implemented locally on each probe and supplemented by classical communication in the data analysis stage @xcite .",
    "the corresponding phase sensitivity can also be computed analytically ( see appendix  [ app : parallel ] ) , and quite remarkably it turns out to _ coincide _ with that of @xmath120 in the @xmath1-round setting ( i.e. , the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this behaviour is generic and does not depend on the specific sub - optimal observable measured on each probe .",
    "that is , although the parallel - entangled setting can , in principle , outperform the sequential one asymptotically @xcite , we find that they may become metrologically equivalent when the probe readout at the output is limited to measuring local observables : this restriction _ de facto _ banishes the asymptotic linear scaling of the precision .",
    "it is important to remark that we assumed a particular probe preparation ( ghz states ) .",
    "therefore , our observations should not be understood as a general ` no - go ' result , advocating against parallel - entangled estimation strategies in the presence of noise . the general question of whether the gap between sequential and parallel - entangled settings @xcite persists when optimal input states and more general separable measurements are considered is definitely worthy of further investigation , although it lies beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "finally , as an example of the usefulness of entanglement in a practical sequential scenario , let us supplement the probe with a passive two - level ancilla .",
    "specifically , we can prepare the probe - ancilla pair in a bell state @xmath133 ( which has the same @xmath134norm of coherence as the single - qubit @xmath101 and @xmath8-qubit ghz states ) and apply the noisy channel only on the first qubit , yielding @xmath135 .",
    "we find that , although interrogating probe and ancilla by a separable measurement like @xmath136 reduces once more to the same sensitivity as the single - qubit unassisted scenario ( dashed curve in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , performing instead a non - separable ( yet manageable ) measurement such as @xmath137 does provide a sizeable increase in phase sensitivity ( see appendix  [ app : passive ] ) .",
    "in general , one may conclude that using independent probes in a sequential scheme , possibly supplemented by correlated passive ancillas , offers a _ practical advantage _ in noisy parameter estimation , in spite of the potential superiority of parallel - entangled strategies @xcite . as we illustrated , acquiring partial information about the geometry of the parameter - imprinting process allows one to optimize the estimation protocol at the single - probe level , by simply adjusting the sampling time or number of rounds .",
    "such a sequential estimation protocol relies on the initial amount of `` unspeakable '' coherence @xcite , which is a genuinely quantum feature @xcite , and is here confirmed as the key resource for estimating parameters encoded in incoherent operations , which include all phase - covariant channels .",
    "however , the estimation performance only scales linearly or `` classically '' in the probe size , whereby scaling up the probe size is intended as repeating the optimized sequential procedure @xmath77 times using independent probe qubits , all initialized in a maximally coherent state .",
    "nonetheless , at the single - probe level , the sensitivity does scale quadratically in the number of rounds @xmath8 , provided @xmath1 is well below @xmath138 .",
    "notably , in the technologically relevant limit of @xmath139 ( e.g. magnetometry in a very weak magnetic field ) , the optimal number of rounds @xmath2 stays fairly large even for relatively low @xmath140 ( see appendix  [ app : kraus ] ) , which translates into a very uncertain phase generator . as a result , a quadratic - like scaling of the precision for each individual probe",
    "can be maintained up to many iterations , although definitely not asymptotically .",
    "an interesting next step could be to extend our analysis to _ multiparameter metrology _ ,",
    "e.g.  considering the simultaneous estimation of the phase @xmath72 and the noise parameter @xmath112 , or the actual generator @xmath141 @xcite .    to conclude ,",
    "let us remark that , in general , the comparison between different metrological settings is a particularly tricky subject , since all the _ resources _ must be identified and properly accounted for @xcite .",
    "for instance , in spite of the formal equivalence of sequential and parallel settings in absence of noise , promoting the ` number of rounds ' to the status of resource , at the same level as the ` number of probes ' is probably not fair , since the actual costs of preparation , control and measurement of an additional quantum probe are not comparable to the costs of increasing the sampling time for one additional round .",
    "it is surely worthwhile to put different metrological settings under a unified set - up , also including feedback control protocols , so as to carry out an objective bookkeeping of the associated costs",
    ". this will be the subject of future work .",

    "in this section we will give further details about the performance of the sequential estimation setting when the probe is supplemented with a passive two - level ancilla . recall from the main text that ,",

    "jointly _ on the probe and the ancilla , the ensuing sensitivity can come much closer to the ultimate limit set by @xmath215 .    .",

    "the over - bar denotes complex conjugation and @xmath229 is given by @xmath230 then , the qfi ( @xmath231 ) may be calculated using eq .   and is given by @xmath232    the contribution of the first term in eq .",
    "to the total sensitivity is qualitatively similar to the qfi in the sequential setting , i.e. it scales quadratically for low @xmath1 and , after peaking , it decays exponentially to zero .",
    "however , the second term , contributes with an classical - like increase in @xmath1 , which ultimately yields a linear asymptotic scaling for the overall qfi . as stated in the main text ,",
    "while the first contribution relates to the outermost `` corners '' of the density operator ( i.e. the subspace spanned by @xmath233 and @xmath234 , with total angular momentum @xmath235 ) , the second one is determined by all the matrix elements along the diagonal of the state , such that @xmath236 . in particular , accessing all the relevant information giving rise to the classical - like asymptotic scaling of the sensitivity thus requires one to perform a non - separable measurement capable of telling the subspace @xmath235 from its complementary @xmath236 , such as a measurement of the total angular momentum @xmath131 .",
    "analogously to the sequential setting , one can consider the sensitivity of a sub - optimal estimator .",

    "as pointed out in the main text this yields exactly the same formula of eq .  , thus implying that the parallel - entangled and unentangled sequential settings are metrologically equivalent so long as the estimation is constrained to separable measurements .",
    "note furthermore that , in both sequential and parallel settings , one could consider alternative observables to @xmath204 with eigenbases on the equatorial plane of the bloch sphere , such as @xmath238 or even some suboptimal yet phase - dependent observable .",
    "generically , the oscillatory behavior will remain , but the periodicity and locations of the maxima will change depending on the chosen observable ."
