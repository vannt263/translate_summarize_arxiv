    "in 1990 scharnhorst demonstrated that the propagation of light in the casimir vacuum  @xcite is characterized by an anomalous speed  @xcite .",
    "in fact photons propagating perpendicular to the plates travel at a speed @xmath0 which slightly exceeds the usual speed of light @xmath1 in the minkowski vacuum  @xcite .",
    "the propagation of photons parallel to the plates instead occurs at the usual speed @xmath2 .",
    "unfortunately this anomalous propagation is far too small to be experimentally detectable ; the relative modifications to the speed of light are of order @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the fine structure constant , @xmath5 is the distance between the plates , and @xmath6 is the electron mass .",
    "[ we work in units such that @xmath7 .",
    "greek and latin indices run from 0 to 3 and from 1 to 3 , respectively .",
    "@xmath8 denotes the minkowski metric . ]",
    "it is nevertheless an important point of principle that a quantum vacuum which is polarized by an external constraint can behave as a dispersive medium with refractive index @xmath9 which remains less than unity to arbitrarily high frequency .",
    "similar effects have been discovered in the case of quantum vacuum polarization in gravitational fields  @xcite , and several other situations  @xcite .",
    "it is to be emphasized that the scharnhorst effect , albeit small , is of fundamental theoretical importance .",
    "though the present calculations are carried out in the `` soft photon '' approximation ( wavelengths much larger than an electron compton wavelength ) there is an argument based on dispersion relations which strongly suggests the actual signal speed is also modified ( indeed , increased )  @xcite  the physics here is very different from that of the resonance - induced `` apparent '' superluminal velocities currently of experimental interest  @xcite ; here we are dealing with quantum polarization induced `` true '' superluminal velocities , albeit well outside the realm of present day experimental technique .",
    "a common feature of the gravitational analogs of the scharnhorst effect is the presence of birefringence : photons with different polarizations propagate at different speeds .",
    "similarly in generic situations nonlinear electrodynamics often leads to birefringence  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless the occurrence of birefringence in nonlinear electrodynamics is not universal . indeed , in the casimir vacuum between parallel conducting plates the possibility of birefringence is tightly constrained : there is a residual ( 2 + 1 ) lorentz invariance which prevents birefringence for photons that propagate parallel to the plates , and similarly there is an @xmath10 rotational invariance that prevents birefringence for photons that propagate perpendicular to the plates .",
    "it is only for photons that propagate obliquely to the plates that there is even any possibility of birefringence .",
    "we shall be interested in a complete analysis of both propagation speed and polarization states as a function of angle , and as a side effect report the ( melancholy ) conclusion that birefringence is completely absent in the casimir vacuum .",
    "as a consequence , an effective metric description is sufficient for completely specifying photon propagation in the casimir vacuum  though it will in general not be sufficient for other more general vacuum states .",
    "the effective metric we find is subtly at variance with previous results obtained by performing a `` polarization sum ''  @xcite .",
    "the disagreement is due to the way that `` polarization sums '' are implemented in the extant literature , where they are defined in terms of the flat minkowski metric .",
    "we show that in the absence of birefringence a fully consistent polarization sum must be implemented in terms of a bootstrap procedure ; using as input the effective metric one is attempting to define . furthermore , in the presence of birefringence , we demonstrate that the polarization sum technique is intrinsically an approximation .",
    "fortunately the differences first show up at order @xmath11 , and in almost all circumstances are completely negligible .    throughout",
    ", we emphasize the use of symmetry arguments as a way of extracting general information that is ( as much as possible ) independent of the particular choice of lagrangian .",
    "finally , we have a few words to say concerning the utility of effective metric approaches in other contexts well beyond the casimir vacuum .",
    "anomalous photon propagation can most easily be interpreted in terms of nonlinear electrodynamics . after integrating out virtual electron loops , the maxwell lagrangian should be replaced ( in the absence of boundaries , at the one - loop level , and provided the distance scales defined by the field gradients and photon wavelength are much larger than the electron compton wavelength ) by schwinger s effective lagrangian  @xcite @xmath12 here we have adopted the now common variables  @xcite @xmath13 the precise functional form of schwinger s lagrangian will not be needed : at the end of the calculation we shall see that it is sufficient to retain only the quartic terms beyond the maxwell lagrangian ( the euler  heisenberg lagrangian  @xcite ) .",
    "now in the casimir geometry between parallel plates there is one additional invariant one could consider , namely @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a unit vector orthogonal to the plates .",
    "( a similar invariant obtained by interchanging @xmath16 and @xmath17 is actually a redundant linear combination of the invariants @xmath18 and @xmath19 . ) in addition the coefficients in the effective lagrangian can now explicitly depend on the @xmath20 coordinate .",
    "when it comes to practical calculations all these effects are suppressed by additional factors of @xmath21 , but in the interests of generality we retain them for the time being and simply write : @xmath22 that is , the considerations of the following section are not limited to the casimir parallel plate geometry but apply whenever the soft photon approximation ( and the ancillary linearization procedure and restricted eikonal approximation ) make sense .",
    "the complete equations of motion for nonlinear electrodynamics consist of the bianchi identity , @xmath23}=0,\\ ] ] plus the dynamical equation @xmath24 we now adopt a linearization procedure : split the electromagnetic field into a background plus a propagating photon @xmath25 then assuming the background satisfies the equations of motion , and retaining only linear terms in the propagating photon , we have @xmath26}=0,\\ ] ] and @xmath27 on defining @xmath28 equation ( [ e : eom1 ] ) can be rewritten in the somewhat more compact form @xmath29 note that the tensor @xmath30 is symmetric with respect to exchange of the pairs of indices @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and antisymmetric with respect to exchange of indices within each pair .",
    "we now apply a restricted form of the eikonal approximation by introducing a slowly varying amplitude @xmath33 and a rapidly varying phase @xmath34 : @xmath35 the wave vector ( actually a one - form , but we shall loosely refer to both vectors and one - forms as `` vectors '' in the text , because of the mapping provided by @xmath36 and its inverse @xmath37 ) is then defined as @xmath38 .",
    "this approximation is similar to , but not quite identical with , the usual eikonal approximation .",
    "this is because one assumes that @xmath34 varies on scales much smaller than those of the background , while , on the other hand , use of the lagrangian ( [ e : effective - lagrangian ] ) also implies that the components of @xmath39 are much smaller than the values fixed by the electron mass ( soft - photon regime ) . under these hypotheses , @xmath40 but",
    "the background field is itself subject to quantum fluctuations , and to take this into account the coefficients of this equation are identified with the expectation value of the corresponding quantum operators in the background state @xmath41 : @xmath42 in taking this expectation value we are using the fact that the fluctuations in the background fields are determined by the geometry ( in the specific case of the casimir geometry , by the distance between the plates ) , so that in the spirit of the restricted eikonal approximation there is a separation of scales between the background fluctuations and the propagating photon .",
    "the bianchi identity ( [ e : bianchi2 ] ) constrains @xmath33 to be of the form @xmath43 where we have introduced the gauge potential @xmath5 for the propagating field . inserting ( [ e : fgp ] ) into ( [ e : eom - master ] ) we find @xmath44 in general , the tensorial quantity @xmath45 with the same symmetries as @xmath46 : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a function that can in principle be computed directly from the effective lagrangian .",
    "equation ( [ e : eom - master2 ] ) represents a condition for @xmath5 as a function of @xmath39  it constrains @xmath5 to be an eigenvector , with zero eigenvalue , of the @xmath39-dependent matrix @xmath49 any non - zero solution corresponds to a physically possible field polarization , that can be identified by a unit polarization vector @xmath50 ( provided @xmath5 is not a null vector  a possibility that can always be avoided by a suitable gauge choice ) .",
    "a necessary and sufficient condition for the eigenvalue problem @xmath51 to have non - zero solutions is @xmath52 ; however , this gives us no information at all .",
    "indeed , any @xmath5 parallel to @xmath39 is always a non - zero solution , so the condition @xmath53 is actually an identity . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath54 is merely an unphysical gauge mode that corresponds to @xmath55 by ( [ e : fgp ] ) , so we need to find other , physically meaningful , solutions of the eigenvalue problem . to this end , we exploit gauge invariance under @xmath56 and fix a gauge , thus removing the spurious modes .",
    "it is particularly convenient to adopt the temporal gauge @xmath57 .",
    "then we can define a polarization vector @xmath58 , and the eigenvalue problem @xmath59 splits into the equation @xmath60 plus the reduced eigenvalue problem @xmath61 the latter admits a nontrivial solution only if @xmath62 the condition ( [ e : deta=0 ] ) plays the same role as the fresnel equation in crystal optics  @xcite  it is a scalar equation for @xmath39 and thus gives the dispersion relation for light propagating in our `` medium '' .",
    "an explicit calculation ( see appendix  [ app : fresnel ] ) gives @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 is a homogeneous fourth - order polynomial in the variables @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "this means that in the most general case there are four dispersion relations , corresponding to the four roots of the equation @xmath68 but , if @xmath69 is a root then so is @xmath70 ; thus , by cpt invariance , only two of these dispersion relations are physically distinct .",
    "different polarization states are represented by linearly independent solutions of the eigenvalue problem ( [ e : reduced ] ) , under the condition ( [ e : deta=0 ] ) .",
    "[ obviously , ( [ e:00 ] ) can not be independent of ( [ e : reduced ] ) , since we know that @xmath71 .",
    "] thus , the space of polarizations is at most two - dimensional . since ( [ e : deta=0 ] ) gives rise to two dispersion relations , the polarization states actually satisfy two ( in general , different ) eigenvalue equations , @xmath72 where @xmath73 labels the dispersion relations and @xmath74 is obtained from @xmath75 by imposing the corresponding condition on @xmath39 .",
    "thus , in the general case , modes of the field with different polarizations have different dispersion relations , hence propagate in different ways ; this leads to the phenomenon of birefringence  @xcite .    in some special cases ( in particular ,",
    "this behaviour is quite common in nonlinear electrodynamics ) the polynomial @xmath76 factorizes into two quadratic forms , @xmath77 in which case we obtain two second - order dispersion relations : @xmath78      we now want to consider the special situation in which not only does ( [ eq : factor ] ) hold , but also @xmath79 .",
    "( that is , the fourth - order polynomial @xmath65 is a perfect square . ) in this case one ends up with a single quadratic dispersion relation of the familiar form @xmath80 where @xmath81 is some symmetric tensor .",
    "it should be clear from our previous discussion that a necessary condition for this to happen is the absence of birefringence .",
    "remarkably , we see that the wave vector is now null with respect to a ( unique ) `` effective inverse metric '' @xmath81 . therefore , the propagation of light can be described in terms of an effective geometry , defined by the metric tensor @xmath82 obtained by inverting @xmath81 , such that @xmath83 .",
    "( warning : even when an effective metric is defined , we always raise and lower indices using the flat minkowski metric @xmath36 . in particular , note that @xmath84 ; this justifies our use of different symbols , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , for the effective metric and its inverse . )",
    "this situation implies that @xmath87 must be algebraically constructible solely in terms of @xmath81 . in view of the symmetries of @xmath46 we know , without need for detailed calculation , that it must be of the form @xmath88 for some function @xmath89 .",
    "conversely , if @xmath46 is of the form ( [ e : omega2 ] ) , then the matrix ( [ e : matrix ] ) is @xmath90,\\ ] ] and the photon propagation equation @xmath51 becomes @xmath91 this equation is obviously satisfied by the uninteresting gauge modes @xmath54 , with no constraints on @xmath39 .",
    "solutions corresponding to a non - vanishing @xmath33 exist only if the coefficient of @xmath92 is zero , , if ( [ e : eomfc ] ) holds .",
    "thus , the two polarization states propagate with the same dispersion relation ( [ e : eomfc ] ) , and there is no birefringence .    substituting ( [ e : eomfc ] ) back into the propagation equation ( [ e : newpropageq ] ) we find another relationship typical of this case , @xmath93 formally , the above equation looks like a gauge condition .",
    "this might seem puzzling , because nowhere in the present subsection have we fixed a gauge .",
    "in fact , ( [ e : gkepsilon ] ) is a consequence of the dynamical equation @xmath51 , when the `` on - shell '' condition ( [ e : eomfc ] ) is satisfied , and it does _ not _ imply any gauge fixing .    finally ,",
    "it is interesting to notice that there is now a self - consistency or `` bootstrap '' condition , @xmath94 this can be re - stated directly in terms of the fundamental coefficients as @xmath95 we stress that these relations depend only on the assumed existence of a single unique effective metric @xmath82  they do not make any reference to other specifics of the quantum state .",
    "let us now consider a region of empty space delimited by two perfectly conducting parallel plates placed orthogonal to the @xmath20 axis at positions @xmath96 and @xmath97 , in the quantum state @xmath98 corresponding to the casimir vacuum  @xcite .      in the casimir vacuum",
    "considerable information can be extracted by using only symmetry considerations , similarly to what bryce dewitt did for the stress - energy - momentum tensor in reference  @xcite . always working in the soft photon approximation ,",
    "the presence of a preferred direction and the symmetry of the configuration allow us to claim that the function @xmath48 can only depend on the @xmath20 coordinate , and to write @xmath99 in the form @xmath100 where @xmath101 is another function .",
    "the calculation of @xmath102 and @xmath101 in this case is straightforward , using identities that follow from ( [ e : define - delta ] ) and ( [ e : mehsym ] ) : @xmath103 @xmath104 on defining the function @xmath105 and the tensor @xmath106 @xmath107 takes the particularly simple form @xmath108 thus , from the discussion in subsection [ ss : effmet ] , we deduce without further argument that there is no birefringence , and that @xmath81 given in ( [ e : metrica ] ) plays the role of an effective inverse metric for the propagation of light in the casimir vacuum .",
    "the corresponding effective metric is @xmath109 we stress that for this derivation of the effective metric to make sense it is necessary that the spatial variation in @xmath110 be compatible with the restricted eikonal approximation : that is @xmath110 should vary slowly on the scale of the photon wavelength .",
    "this is certainly true for qed at lowest nontrivial order where we shall soon see that @xmath111 is in fact independent of @xmath20 .",
    "the conclusion about the absence of birefringence can also be obtained more explicitly .",
    "choosing the temporal gauge , and following the steps outlined in the general analysis of subsection [ ss : dispersion - relations ] , equation ( [ e:00 ] ) becomes @xmath112 which also follows from ( [ e : gkepsilon ] ) when @xmath113 .",
    "a tedious but straightforward calculation gives @xmath114 thus the dispersion relation determined from ( [ e : deta=0 ] ) takes in this case the form ( [ e : eomfc ] ) , as expected .",
    "we note here that , although an equation of the form ( [ e : eomfc ] ) has been already obtained by dittrich and gies  @xcite , the expression for the effective metric underlying their dispersion relation is subtly at variance with our results ( [ e : metrica ] ) and ( [ e : nuova ! ] ) .",
    "we shall comment about the reason for this discrepancy in appendix  [ app : polsum ] .      in order to explicitly find the polarization states ,",
    "let us evaluate ( [ e : matrix ] ) using the expression for @xmath115 and ( [ e : eomfc ] ) , and then consider the reduced eigenvalue problem ( [ e : reduced ] ) .",
    "we find that @xmath116 must be a solution of the problem @xmath117 , where @xmath118 this eigenvalue problem , however , is manifestly equivalent to the single equation ( [ e:0 ] ) , which is thus the only constraint that the polarization states must satisfy .",
    "therefore , the space of polarization states is two - dimensional , as expected .",
    "a basis for such a space can be easily constructed by considering generic propagation in the @xmath119 plane [ not a restrictive hypothesis , because of @xmath10 invariance with respect to rotations around the @xmath20 axis ] , described by the 3-vector ( these are taken to be covariant components , index down ) : @xmath120 equation ( [ e:0 ] ) then becomes @xmath121 so two independent polarizations are : @xmath122 where @xmath123 is a normalization coefficient .",
    "note in particular that @xmath124 is not perpendicular to @xmath125 when viewed in terms of the minkowski metric @xmath37 , though they are perpendicular when viewed in terms of the effective metric @xmath81 .",
    "furthermore we have chosen to make @xmath124 a unit vector with respect to the minkowski metric , not with respect to the effective metric .",
    "if @xmath125 has the form ( [ e : wavevector ] ) , equation ( [ e : eomfc ] ) becomes ( the norms are with respect to the euclidean spatial metric induced by @xmath36 ) : @xmath126 the phase velocity is given by @xmath127 and is independent of the polarization .",
    "this is again a consequence of the fact that the quantity @xmath128 appears squared in @xmath129 , so equation ( [ e : deta=0 ] ) describes a degenerate fourth - degree surface in the space of the vectors @xmath130 .",
    "hence , there is only one dispersion relation , equation ( [ e : eomcepthe2 ] ) , independent of the polarization state , and only one phase speed for each value of @xmath131 .",
    "this confirms that birefringence does not take place in the casimir vacuum .",
    "note that if @xmath132 and @xmath133 , we have @xmath134 . since , in the limit @xmath135 , @xmath136 equals the front velocity ( signal velocity )  @xcite , one is tempted to argue that the propagation is superluminal for all values of @xmath137 different from @xmath138 .",
    "this conclusion can also be inferred directly from ( [ e : eomfc ] ) , which for @xmath132 implies that @xmath39 is timelike ( with respect to the undisturbed minkowski metric ) .",
    "since @xmath39 can also be interpreted as the four - vector orthogonal to a surface of discontinuity of the field  @xcite , it follows that such a surface is spacelike ( with respect to the minkowski metric ) , , that electromagnetic signals travel `` faster than light '' .",
    "( this phrasing is standard but unfortunate , and is logically indefensible .",
    "it should always be interpreted in the sense `` faster than light would have travelled in an undisturbed portion of normal vacuum '' . )",
    "equivalently , ( [ e : nuova ! ] ) implies that for @xmath132 the lightcones of the effective metric @xmath82 are wider than those of the minkowski metric @xmath36 .",
    "unfortunately , while it is certainly true that our treatment is valid at high frequencies ( with respect to those associated to the background scales ) , it nevertheless also requires @xmath139  the condition under which one can use the lagrangian ( [ e : schwinger - lagrangian ] )  , so we have no direct information about the strict @xmath140 limit .",
    "see , however , reference  @xcite for an indirect argument based on the kramers  kronig dispersion relation that combined with the present calculation is sufficient to establish superluminal propagation for the signal velocity . in the special case @xmath141",
    "one has @xmath142 : photons propagating parallel to the plates travel at the standard speed of light .",
    "the group velocity is a little tricky , it equals @xmath143,\\ ] ] so equations ( [ e : wavevector ] ) and ( [ e : speed ] ) give @xmath144 in particular , the group velocity @xmath145 is not parallel to the wave - vector @xmath146 , though it is always orthogonal to the polarization vector . taking the norm ( in the physical minkowski metric ) , @xmath147^{1/2}.\\ ] ]",
    "the group speed is at all angles slightly greater than ( or at worst equal to ) the phase speed .",
    "( see figure 1 . )",
    "indeed @xmath148 ( see figure 2 . )",
    "care should be taken to realize that here @xmath137 is the angle between the wave vector and the normal , and is not quite the same as the direction of propagation of the wave packet .",
    "fortunately at both normal incidence ( @xmath149 ) and parallel propagation ( @xmath141 ) the distinction between group and phase velocities disappears .",
    "furthermore , as we shall see below , if we work to second order in the fine structure constant , the difference between group and phase speed is negligible at all angles , although a difference of order @xmath150 still remains between the directions of @xmath145 and @xmath146 .",
    "the group velocity ( [ e : vgroup ] ) is greater than 1 when @xmath132 .",
    "thus , the group speed is larger than 1 whenever the phase speed is , although in general their individual values are different .",
    "so far we have seen that , based solely on symmetry considerations , we can eliminate the possibility of birefringence in the casimir vacuum and place strong constraints on the general features of photon propagation in this vacuum .",
    "our results are in fact generic to any form of nonlinear electrodynamics subject to the boundary conditions appropriate for the casimir vacuum , and are not specifically restricted to qed . where qed is important is in determining the specific form of the functions @xmath102 and @xmath101 , which determine @xmath110 , and hence determine the _ size _ ( but not the qualitative features ) of the scharnhorst effect .",
    "unless one wants to perform calculations to orders higher than @xmath150 , it is sufficient to consider the euler  heisenberg lagrangian  @xcite which , in the @xmath151@xmath152 formalism adopted above , takes the form @xmath153 with @xmath154 the terms proportional to @xmath155 and @xmath156 of this lagrangian are quartic in the field , and describe the low - energy limit of the box diagram in qed , when four photons couple to a single virtual electron loop .",
    "thus , the lagrangian ( [ e : ehxy ] ) is only accurate to order @xmath150 , and it is meaningless to retain higher order terms within this model .",
    "in particular , deviations from ( 3 + 1 ) lorentz symmetry due to the presence of the plates ( the plates reduce the symmetry group to that of ( 2 + 1 ) lorentz invariance ) must on physical grounds vanish as the plate separation goes to infinity , where one must recover the full ( 3 + 1 ) lorentz symmetry . on dimensional grounds",
    "this implies that such terms will be suppressed by some function of @xmath157 and can , to lowest nontrivial order , be neglected in the effective lagrangian . on the other hand , even for lowest nontrivial order in the effective lagrangian ( that is , for the euler  heisenberg lagrangian ) , the presence of the plates leads to a nontrivial expectation value for @xmath158 and will in this way contribute to the effective metric .    for the euler  heisenberg lagrangian ,",
    "the tensor @xmath159 is @xmath160 so in the casimir vacuum @xmath161 while @xmath101 is of order @xmath150 .",
    "hence , to first order in @xmath150 , we have @xmath162 , and @xmath163 though in principle the coefficient @xmath101 could depend on @xmath20 , the position relative to the two plates , we shall see that in the specific case of the casimir vacuum it is simply a position - independent number .    to establish this ,",

    ", then imply @xmath168 finally the well - known result @xmath169 allows us to write @xmath170 and in particular , this implies @xmath101 is position independent .",

    "we have seen that symmetry considerations alone imply that @xmath99 must be of the form ( [ e : mehsym ] ) .",
    "this , in turn , implies that there is only one value for the speed of light , independent of the polarization .",
    "thus , the possibility of birefringence in the casimir vacuum is completely ruled out by very general arguments ( the abstract form of the lagrangian for nonlinear electrodynamics , plus the tensor structure of @xmath99 dictated by the geometry ) .",
    "because of its generality , this conclusion applies not just to qed itself but to arbitrary types of nonlinear electrodynamics ( such as for instance , born  infeld theories ) .",
    "how are we to interpret this result in view of the fact that nonlinear electrodynamics generically _ does _ lead to birefringence  @xcite ?",
    "the key point is that in those analyses the background field @xmath175 is nonzero . more generally , even after averaging over quantum fluctuations of the background , @xmath176 in the quantum state appropriate to those analyses .",
    "in the casimir vacuum on the other hand , the expectation values linear in the field do vanish , @xmath177 , and it is only the quadratic expectation values ( and higher ) that are nonzero ( @xmath178 ) .",
    "this key difference makes the analyses of  @xcite inapplicable to the casimir vacuum  technically speaking , the polarization basis used in those papers fails to be meaningful for the casimir vacuum . on the other hand ,",
    "the discussion of the present paper could be easily adapted to treat light propagation in the presence of an electromagnetic background field .",
    "it is sufficient to keep in mind that in this case there is a preferred 2-dimensional plane defined by the 2-form @xmath179 .",
    "correspondingly , the form of @xmath173 will be more complicated [ see ( [ e : m ] ) ] .",

    "then the components of @xmath186 in a basis with one axis directed along @xmath187 are @xmath188 in particular @xmath189 then the matrix @xmath186 has the following structure : @xmath190 where @xmath191 and @xmath192 label the two directions orthogonal to @xmath187 . evaluating the determinant by expanding in the first row or column , it is easy to see that every term will contain at least two factors of @xmath66 , which establishes equation ( [ eq : poli ] ) as desired",
    "in this appendix we discuss the reason for the difference between our expressions ( [ e : metrica ] ) and ( [ e : nuova ! ] ) for the effective metric and those implicit in the `` light cone condition '' in reference  @xcite . in the spirit of that paper a dispersion relation would be derived as follows ( a certain amount of `` translation '' is required to get that formalism to match with the current notation ) .",
    "first , one writes equation ( [ e : eom - master2 ] ) for two polarization states @xmath193 and @xmath194 orthogonal to each other : @xmath195 working in lorentz gauge @xmath196 this can be written as @xmath197 where @xmath198 .",
    "one then takes the scalar product of each equation with the corresponding polarization vector .",
    "finally , the resulting two equations are summed .",
    "furthermore , it was explicitly asserted that one could effectively replace  @xcite @xmath199 in the terms containing @xmath99 . under this hypothesis one obtains , following the steps described above , @xmath200 which is equivalent to equation ( 14 ) of reference  @xcite .",
    "this has the form of the dispersion relation @xmath201 , with @xmath202 specializing to the casimir vacuum , and normalizing appropriately , one has @xmath203 clearly different from ( [ e : metrica ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , when one considers qed corrections to the maxwell lagrangian , @xmath48 is of order @xmath204 , while @xmath205 is of order @xmath150 ( see section  [ s : size ] above ) ; therefore , the two metrics ( [ e : metrica ] ) and ( [ e : wrongmetric ] ) agree to order @xmath150 .",
    "the reason for the discrepancy is that the formal replacement ( [ e : wrong - sum ] ) is limited in a subtle manner . strictly speaking ,",
    "it is correct as it stands only if photon propagation is governed by the minkowski metric @xmath36 ; which is exactly the situation we are trying to get away from . in order to see this explicitly ,",
    "let us introduce an orthonormal tetrad @xmath206 , with @xmath207 timelike and @xmath208 spacelike , so one can write @xmath209 working in the lorentz gauge , as in reference  @xcite , the two - dimensional subspace of minkowski spacetime , orthogonal to @xmath210 and @xmath211 and spanned by the unit vectors @xmath207 and @xmath208 , contains the wave vector @xmath39 , so @xmath212 following the same steps that led to ( [ e : dg ] ) , but using ( [ e:33 ] ) instead of the replacement ( [ e : wrong - sum ] ) , we find , in place of the single term @xmath213 occurring in ( [ e : dg ] ) , the two terms @xmath214 where we have used ( [ e : k ] ) and the symmetry properties of @xmath215 .",
    "clearly , the second term in the expression ( [ e : omegakkright ] ) can not be ignored unless @xmath216 .",
    "we conclude that it is the subtly incorrect replacement ( [ e : wrong - sum ] ) which implies that the derivation of ( [ e : dg ] ) , ( [ e : dg2 ] ) , and ( [ e : wrongmetric ] ) is limited to first order in @xmath150 . for the casimir vacuum , @xmath217 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & d_2\\left [ -1 + \\sum_{r=1}^2\\left(n\\cdot\\widetilde{\\epsilon}_{(r)}\\right)^2 \\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using now the relation @xmath218 , which follows from ( [ e:?2 ] ) upon contraction with @xmath174 in the lorentz gauge , we see that @xmath219 so ( [ e : dg ] ) , corrected by the additional term ( [ e : add ] ) , indeed reproduces the metric ( [ e : metrica ] ) .    in general ,",
    "if the photon dispersion is in fact determined by some ( unique ) effective metric @xmath82 then one can choose a tetrad like @xmath220 , but which is orthonormal with respect to @xmath82 , so now @xmath221 applying this polarization sum to the photon propagation equation written in the form ( [ e : eom - master2 ] ) , and using the properties ( [ e : eomfc ] ) and ( [ e : gkepsilon ] ) , we see that the strictly correct replacement for the polarization sum is @xmath222 this modified polarization sum , applied to ( [ e : eom - master2 ] ) , is consistent with the `` bootstrap '' condition ( [ e : bootstrap2 ] ) .    in the particular case of the casimir vacuum , it is a simple matter to verify , using our expression for @xmath81 , that the bootstrap condition is indeed satisfied .",
    "it is now also clear why the formalism of  @xcite works to first order in @xmath150 : since the difference between @xmath37 and @xmath81 is itself of order @xmath111 ( that is , of order @xmath150 ) the difference between the ( subtly incorrect ) formula ( [ e : wrongmetric ] ) , derived on the basis of ( [ e : wrong - sum ] ) , and the consistency condition ( [ e : bootstrap2 ] ) is automatically of order @xmath223 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "this may also be explicitly verified using the approximation @xmath224 so that @xmath225 substituting this into ( [ e : bootstrap2 ] ) self - consistently reproduces @xmath81 to the required order .",
    "note that in almost all cases of interest one is quite content to work to first order in @xmath150 in which case all of these subtleties are moot .",
    "we conclude with some general comments about the derivation of a metric from a polarization sum : if there is only one dispersion relation for all polarizations , as for instance in the casimir vacuum discussed above , then @xmath193 and @xmath194 both satisfy the _ same _",
    "equation @xmath226 [ see ( [ e : nonsing ] ) ] , with the _ same _ matrix @xmath227 .",
    "however , if @xmath193 and @xmath194 correspond to two different dispersion relations , their propagation equations will actually differ , because now @xmath228 .",
    "therefore , a procedure of the form described at the beginning of this appendix is fundamentally flawed in the general case , as it fails to take into account the possibility of birefringence , and is in fact ( strictly speaking ) incompatible with birefringence .",
    "indeed , summing the equations @xmath229 which do take birefringence into account , appears rather impractical , and it is not obvious whether the structure of the resulting equation will allow the use of a polarization sum at all .",
    "thus , producing `` average dispersion relations '' by polarization sums is at some deep level internally inconsistent , except in the cases when no polarization sum is needed .",
    "it is only if one is limiting interest to lowest - order ( @xmath150 ) corrections away from minkowski space that the polarization sum makes sense for a birefringent system , and only then in the sense that @xmath230 that is : although equation ( [ e : eom - master2 ] ) is exact , we could choose to contract it with _ approximate _ polarization states appropriate to flat minkowski space .",
    "as long as the deviations from the ordinary speed of light are small , so are the deviations of the true polarization states from the usual ones , and then an approximate polarization sum of the above form is useful .",
    "we conclude that the polarization sum technique is most useful if there is no birefringence , and that in the presence of birefringence it is , at best , only useful when strictly limited to lowest - order corrections to minkowski space propagation .",
