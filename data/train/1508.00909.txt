    "<S> we add two more expansion terms in the inverse top quark mass to the @xmath0 result . </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath1 expansion converges poorly , we try to improve on it by factorizing the exact leading order cross section . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two ways of doing that and conclude that the finite top quark mass effects shift the cross section at most by about 10% at next - to - leading order and by about 5% at next - to - next - to - leading order .    </S>",
