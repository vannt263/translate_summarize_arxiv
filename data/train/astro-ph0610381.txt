    "any theory of low - mass star formation should not only be able to make predictions for one characteristic stage such as the core mass spectrum in molecular clouds or the initial mass function of emerging stars - but also relate those through both pre- and protostellar stages . a number of the very basic questions of star formation still remain unanswered and debated ( see , e.g. , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite for recent reviews and discussions of both observational and theoretical studies ) , which can be addressed with large homogeneous surveys from mid - infrared through ( sub)millimeter wavelengths and well - defined lists of sources such as those presented in this paper . for example , is the star formation process highly dynamical with cores being transient phenomena in a turbulent medium and are protostars only accreting in short periods of time when `` passing by '' these dense environments ( i.e. , bondi - hoyle accretion ) ? or is low - mass star formation a more slowly evolving process as preferred in traditional ambipolar diffusion scenarios and in that case , how important are other effects such as turbulence in regulating the speed by which the process occurs ? how efficient is the star formation process in turning prestellar dust and gas into young stars ?",
    "are there specific relationships between the natal prestellar cores and the emerging protostars , for example : do the properties of prestellar cores reflect in whether a given core actually forms a star and perhaps whether it forms a single or multiple system ? many of these discussions hinge on statistical arguments , for example estimates of the evolutionary rate of protostars through counts of the number of ysos in different stages . previous studies of the deeply embedded stages were hampered by low sensitivity single element ( sub)millimeter receivers and confusion in low resolution , low sensitivity infrared observations such as those from the iras and iso satellites . in the last few years systematic , detailed surveys of larger regions have been made possible using wide area imaging at high resolution and sensitivity using submillimeter telescopes such as the jcmt with scuba and mid - infrared telescopes including the spitzer space telescope and its infrared array camera ( irac ) and multiband imaging photometer ( mips ) . in this paper",
    "we present a census of the deeply embedded low - mass protostars in the perseus molecular cloud utilizing recently obtained large scale spitzer / c2d @xcite and jcmt / scuba maps @xcite and discuss some of the strong constraints for theories of low - mass star formation emerging from these homogeneous datasets .",
    "the earliest , most deeply embedded stages of low - mass protostars or the latest stages of prestellar cores close to the onset of collapse are important for insight into the physical conditions regulating low - mass star formation . approaching the problem from the prestellar stages ,",
    "continuum observations provide strong constraints on the distribution of dust , and through inference the gas , in star forming regions .",
    "in particular , large scale mapping with submillimeter and millimeter wavelength continuum bolometers ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have enabled relatively unbiased tabulations of dust condensations that either just have or are likely to form protostars .",
    "the distribution of dust emission can also be used to infer the column density distribution of the dust in both pre- and protostellar cores and from there potentially derive self - consistent density and temperature distributions through detailed radiative transfer modeling ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , observed parameters such as peak flux or size can be used as empirical diagnostics to estimate which cores will undergo collapse ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dust continuum maps themselves do not answer the question whether a given core already has formed a central protostar : for that deep mid - infrared observations are needed .",
    "furthermore mid - infrared observations are important as an evolutionary indicator once the protostar itself has formed : its infrared excess , spectral slope in the mid - infrared range or combination of colors are typically used to distinguish between objects in different stages ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "still , the infrared colors themselves do not provide an unambiguous mapping to object type and/or evolutionary status .",
    "deeply embedded ysos for example share many of the same sed characteristics as more evolved edge - on disk systems .",
    "also , since the most deeply embedded ysos emit a significant fraction of their luminosity at far - infrared and submillimeter wavelengths ( class 0 objects are for example observationally defined as objects emitting more than 0.5% of their total luminosity at wavelengths",
    "longer than 350  @xmath0 m ; e.g. , @xcite ) establishing their full seds through these wavelengths is important .",
    "all of these issues illustrate the importance of combining submillimeter and mid - infrared observations as is done in this paper .",
    "the spitzer space telescope `` from molecular cores to planet forming disks ( cores to disks ; c2d ) '' legacy team @xcite has surveyed 5 of the nearby star forming clouds using the mid - infrared cameras , irac and mips , with the aim of characterizing the ongoing star formation in each .",
    "the `` coordinated molecular probe line extinction thermal emission ( complete ) '' survey of star forming regions @xcite collect data for the three northern of these regions in a range of molecular lines , extinction and dust continuum . in this paper",
    "we combine the information from the c2d and complete surveys of perseus .",
    "perseus is a good test case for such a comparison with a large number of ysos in different environments from large clusters such as ngc  1333 and ic  348 to objects in relative isolation or in small groups like l1448 , l1455 , barnard  1 and barnard  5 .",
    "this paper builds on the analysis of perseus through spitzer @xcite and jcmt / scuba observations @xcite by examining the relation between scuba cores and spitzer sources and thereby building a sample of deeply embedded objects .",
    "the paper is laid out as follows :  [ cluster ] first examines the general association of mid - infrared sources and the scuba cores , the mid - infrared colors of the sources found to be embedded in scuba cores (  [ midir ] ) and the properties of the scuba cores with embedded mid - infrared sources (  [ submm ] ) .  [ overallcloud ] examines the properties of the embedded sources compared to the overall cloud environment in terms of extinction (  [ extincttracer ] ) and submillimeter flux (  [ submmtracer ] ) .",
    "the results of  [ cluster ] and  [ overallcloud ] are combined and an unbiased sample of deeply embedded protostars in perseus is established .  [ discuss ] presents the sample of sources (  [ sample ] ) and points to a number of important observational constraints for models of star formation , in particular in terms of dispersal of newly formed protostars (  [ dispersal ] ) , time scales for the evolution through the prestellar stages (  [ timescales ] ) and the star formation efficiency (  [ sfe ] ) .",
    "the results in this paper will also serve as an important path - finder for comparisons to other clouds surveyed at both mid - infrared and submillimeter wavelengths .",
    "the first task in building up an unbiased list of embedded ysos is to define what is meant by an association between a mid - infrared source and a submillimeter core . for this",
    "we first explore the distribution of mid - infrared spitzer sources in comparison to the dust condensations seen in the scuba maps . in this section",
    "we consider the distribution and properties of the nearest mips 24  @xmath0 m source to each submillimeter core and use these to draw general conclusions about the properties of the embedded mid - infrared sources . in  [ submmtracer ] we turn the table and consider the properties of all the mips 24  @xmath0 m sources in the catalog .",
    "deeply embedded ysos are expected to have a steeply rising sed from the irac through mips wavelengths due to the cold envelope emitting at longer wavelengths while absorbing and reprocessing emission from the central star+disk system at shorter wavelengths .",
    "we therefore expect any deeply embedded yso detected at the irac wavelengths also to be detected at 24  @xmath0 m whereas the inverse may not be true .",
    "the class 0 protostar iras  16293 - 2422 is for example seen in irs observations at 2335  @xmath0 m @xcite ( and likewise in more sensitive mips observations ) but not at the irac wavelengths . as a first try we therefore examine the relationship between mips 24  @xmath0 m sources from the c2d observations @xcite and the scuba cores from the list of @xcite and h.  kirk et al .",
    "( in prep . ) . the one place where this may be problematic is in regions where the 24  @xmath0 m maps are confused or bright emission saturates the images .",
    "we will return to these issues later in this section .",
    "many of the studied sources are also detected at longer wavelengths by mips at 70 and 160  @xmath0 m where the sed of a typical embedded protostar peaks .",
    "on the other hand , these longer wavelength observations are less sensitive , more likely to be saturated and provide a lower angular resolution , and are therefore less useful for identifying individual objects in an unbiased sense ( as is the goal of this paper ) , especially in confused regions . for establishing the full seds of individual objects these data are important of course .",
    "in the following we will refer to the sources detected at 24  @xmath0 m with mips as `` mips sources '' .",
    "one concern is how big the contamination of background sources is and whether these are confused with the yso population .",
    "based on comparison to the extra - galactic swire data , @xcite find that most of the mips sources are background galaxies .",
    "still , the surface density of mips sources in the perseus field is low enough that given a random spatial distribution only 0.2 sources would be found within any 1  arcminute@xmath8 - or likewise that the probability of a chance alignment within 15  of a given scuba core is just a few percent .",
    "[ source_overlay ] shows the distribution of mid - infrared mips sources and submillimeter scuba cores overlaid on scuba maps in a few of prominent regions of perseus .",
    "a number of the scuba cores are associated with mid - infrared sources within rather small distances .",
    "significant clustering is also seen in other manners , for example the clustering of the submillimeter cores or the mid - infrared sources by themselves . in this paper",
    "we only focus on the association of the mid - infrared sources with the submillimeter cores . of the 72 cores from the scuba map , 36 ( 50% )",
    "are found to have a mips counterpart within 15  of the peak ( 31 , or 43% , have a mips source within 10 ) . at the resolution of the spitzer / mips 24  @xmath0",
    "m and scuba observations ( approximately 6@xmath5 and 15@xmath5 , respectively ) it appears that most of the scuba cores are associated with one mips source only ( table  [ multiplicity ] ) .    [ cols= \" < , < , < , <",
    ", < \" , ]      it is interesting to examine whether there is any evolution of the colors of the embedded ysos compared to the properties of their parental cores . for example do the more massive cores generally have more deeply embedded protostars with redder mid - infrared colors ? as shown in fig .",
    "[ flux_histo ] , cores with stronger submillimeter fluxes all have embedded sources but a significant number of `` fainter '' cores also appear to be forming stars .",
    "[ evol_diagram ] shows the @xmath1-[4.5]$ ] and @xmath2-[24]$ ] colors of the embedded ysos with the fluxes of their parental cores indicated .",
    "there are two interesting effects to note : ( i ) this diagram includes all the mips sources located within 15  of a submillimeter core and for those sources there is a clear trend across the diagram with an increase in both colors ( from zero ; or no infrared excess ) toward higher values , possibly approaching a maximum value of their @xmath2-[24]$ ] colors of about 68 .",
    "( ii ) if we apply our criterion of @xmath1-[4.5 ] > 1 $ ] for embeddedness the @xmath2-[24]$ ] colors do not actually increase systematically with flux , but are rather scattered around a value of about 6",
    ". some of the brighter scuba cores have ysos with very red colors , but note also that some mid - infrared sources associated with fairly bright cores have @xmath1-[4.5 ] \\lesssim 1.0 $ ] .",
    "the upturn in colors is roughly as predicted by the models of @xcite but this diagram extends to much bluer [ 8.0]-[24 ] colors than predicted in their models . on the other hand the @xmath1-[4.5]$ ]",
    "colors are much redder than predicted from the models .",
    "@xcite find that only a few deeply embedded ysos should be detectable at the shortest irac wavelengths . that we actually detect a significant fraction of the deeply embedded protostars might again reflect that the envelopes have larger cleared out cavities similar to the case of iras  16293 - 2422a @xcite , in contrast to the assumption of the models of @xcite which extend into 7 stellar radii . at such small inner radii , the mid - infrared emission from the central protostar",
    "would be completely absorbed by the surrounding envelope and the object not detectable at the irac wavelengths .",
    "the fact that most of these sources are detectable at 3.6 and 4.5  @xmath0 m suggest that this is not the case and @xmath1-[4.5]$ ] color therefore is a potentially interesting diagnostic of the properties of the disks and inner envelopes of deeply embedded protostars .      as pointed out in the introduction many important constraints on low - mass star formation hinge on statistical arguments such as using the relative number of pre- and protostellar cores to estimate their lifetimes .",
    "previous studies have often been based on compilations of different surveys not necessarily observed under similar conditions or with the same techniques and have often required the combination of data for many clouds to obtain statistically meaningful samples .",
    "the strength of the combination of the spitzer and scuba data presented in this paper is that it represents a relatively uniform survey of just one cloud and still has enough cores and protostars that strong statements can be made without many of the caveats introduced otherwise .",
    "we here discuss the constraints on three important aspects of low - mass star formation introduced by this study .",
    "one of the debated issues in current theories of star formation is the importance of the motions of embedded ysos through the medium on their accretion rates , i.e. , basically whether bondi - hoyle accretion @xcite applies .",
    "the simulations of @xcite and @xcite for example show that the motions of the embedded ysos through their ambient medium will have a significant impact on their accretion histories and thereby the resulting distribution of ysos as a function of mass . on the other hand based on a study of locations of ysos in different evolutionary stages from taurus",
    ", @xcite argues that the velocity dispersion of the ysos once formed is small @xmath9  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "the narrowness of the distribution of separations between the mid - infrared sources and submillimeter cores ( fig .",
    "[ clustdia_hist ] ) indicates that the dispersal of newly formed stars in perseus is similar to that in taurus .    as shown in fig .",
    "[ clustdia_hist ] the typical separations between the mid - infrared sources and submillimeter cores are less than @xmath11  10 . assuming a typical lifetime of the deeply embedded protostars of @xmath12  years , the velocity dispersion is : @xmath13 which is smaller than the isothermal sound speed , @xmath14  km  s@xmath10 for a molecular cloud with a temperature of 1015  k. @xcite examined the motions of dense cores traced by n@xmath15h@xmath16 @xmath17 emission with respect to less dense ambient envelopes traced by @xmath18co and c@xmath19o @xmath17 .",
    "they found only small velocity differences between the `` cores '' and `` envelopes '' , which they took as evidence that dense cores did not have significant velocities with respect to their surroundings .",
    "@xcite examined the models of @xcite using a similar approach as that in @xcite and also found small velocities of the cores relative to their lower density ambient envelopes .",
    "it therefore appears that those simulations are not invalidated by the observations of @xcite what is shown by this analysis , however , is that the newly formed stars still embedded within their parental cores also do not have highly supersonic velocities and therefore do not seem to travel a substantial distance during their main accretion phase .",
    "it is also interesting to note the similarity to taurus : even though taurus is thought to be forming low - mass stars in a more quiescent fashion compared to perseus , the velocity dispersions are very similar and significantly below the 1  km  s@xmath10 virial speeds inferred in models of protostars accreting while moving through the molecular cloud ( and halting accretion when `` leaving '' the densest regions ) .",
    "this study finds that approximately half the scuba cores from the study of @xcite have embedded ysos .",
    "this suggests that the dissipation time scale of the cores once a protostar has been formed is similar to the time scale over which the cores evolve through the part of the prestellar stage observable by the scuba studies .",
    "@xcite studied a sample of optically identified cores and found that only 24% had embedded ysos , which would imply a time scale for their optically identified , starless cores three times longer than the duration of the protostellar stage .",
    "a comparison between the numbers from this study and those of @xcite therefore suggests that the scuba maps only detect the denser stages in the evolution of prestellar cores whereas the sample of optically identified cores by @xcite also includes less evolved cores . in a study of more dense nh@xmath20 cores",
    ", @xcite found that the ratio of starless to stellar cores were close to unity or lower in a wide range of environments , likewise implying similar time scales for the evolution through the pre- and protostellar stages .",
    "@xcite observed a large sample of 52 starless nh@xmath20 cores with scuba and found that the cores which were bright at submillimeter wavelengths ( i.e. , having peak 850  @xmath0 m flux densities larger than 170  mjy  beam@xmath10 ) constituted approximately half of the cores detected by scuba - and that the cores detected with scuba constituted approximately half of all the studied nh@xmath20 cores .",
    "comparison across such different samples should naturally be treated with care dealing with systematic uncertainties , selection effects , etc .",
    "the big strength of the sample forming the basis of this paper is again that the sources are selected from one large scale systematic and relatively unbiased set of observations with uniform sensitivity .    assuming a typical lifetime of the deeply embedded stages studied here of @xmath21  years ,  years from previous studies - which includes parts of the `` less embedded '' class i stages where the cores associated with the ysos are not picked up by the scuba surveys . ]",
    "the total duration of the starless core stage would be @xmath22  years - with the scuba maps revealing the last @xmath23  years of this evolution where the central density increases above @xmath24  @xmath7 ( j.  @xcite , h.  @xcite ) . as pointed out by @xcite",
    "these time scales are significantly shorter than those for typical ambipolar diffusion models unless the cores are marginally subcritical @xcite .",
    "they are similar to the time scale for depletion in protostellar cores of @xmath25  years derived by @xcite based on the measurements of chemical profiles of pre- and protostellar cores - again suggesting that the scuba dust condensations reflect the stage of prestellar cores where the density is high and significant depletion can start to occur .",
    "we can naturally also compare these numbers to the time scales for the later stages of protostellar evolution .",
    "as pointed out above the objects identified here represent ysos in their first @xmath26  years of evolution and are an important addition to the sample of @xcite .",
    "that study was missing some of these deeply embedded objects but more complete in terms of evolved class  i and class  ii objects which evolve over time scales of approximately 10@xmath27  years .",
    "the number of sources in this list compared to those of @xcite appears to be consistent with the ratio between those time scales of about 10:1 - or alternatively if we accept those time scales as `` known '' : that star formation in perseus has occurred at a fairly constant rate continuing to current times .",
    "we can take the arguments a step further and estimate the star formation efficiency of the submillimeter cores and the entire cloud complex . given the amount of mass in each core from the submillimeter observations",
    "the star formation efficiency can be estimated : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mass of the new formed stars and @xmath30 the mass of the cores .",
    "the total mass of the 72 scuba cores in the perseus cloud was found to be @xmath31106  @xmath32 @xcite and counting only those ysos within 15@xmath5 of one of these submillimeter cores we find 43 ysos . assuming that the masses of the newly formed stars are 0.30.5  @xmath32 , the star formation efficiency for the entire perseus cloud complex is estimated to be @xmath33  1015% .",
    "this is comparable to the star formation efficiency of nearby embedded clusters @xcite .",
    "approximately half of the total core mass in the cloud resides in the cores in ngc  1333 , but doing the same calculation as above the star formation efficiency for just those cores is found to be similar to the value for the entire cloud .",
    "this again implies that significant star formation is currently occurring in the cores `` outside '' the main ngc  1333 and ic  348 clusters  in the dense regions associated with l1448 , l1455 , barnard  1 and barnard  5 amongst others  similar to the conclusion of @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the mass estimates are sensitive to the assumptions about the dust temperature and the dust opacities and to the observational techniques being more or less sensitive to extended structure , for example .",
    "the star formation efficiency quoted above is an estimate of the current core star formation efficiency and does not represent the actual efficiency of assembling the cores from the overall cloud environment : as pointed out by @xcite ( see also @xcite for a similar result for the ophiuchus molecular cloud complex ) only a small fraction ( @xmath34  0.5% ) of the total cloud mass resides in these dense cores with the main fraction ( @xmath35  85% ) of the cloud mass from the extinction maps ( @xmath33  18,500  @xmath32 ; @xcite ) distributed at low @xmath36 .",
    "that number can not be compared to the current mass of deeply embedded protostars from this analysis : a high number of young stellar objects have already formed in the perseus molecular cloud with for example @xcite identifying a `` high quality '' sample of 400 ysos of class ii or earlier .",
    "these spitzer observations are furthermore not picking out a significant number of more evolved , i.e. , class iii ysos with smaller amount of infrared excesses . with these higher number of ysos distributed over all evolutionary stages and the total cloud mass ,",
    "the time averaged star formation efficiency over the entire evolution of the cloud until present time is probably closer to a few percent , which includes the efficiency of assembling cores from the overall cloud dust mass in the first place and subsequently the efficiency of these cores actually forming stars . in this context",
    "it should also be emphasized that the observed mass distribution of scuba core masses is a current snapshot of potentially star forming cores . with their lifetimes of",
    "about @xmath37  years ( sect .",
    "[ timescales ] ) it is not unreasonable to expect that at least 10 times as many cores have previously existed in the cloud and formed what are currently observed as class ii and iii young stellar objects .",
    "this paper has presented a comparison between the dust condensations from scuba maps and mid - infrared sources from spitzer observations .",
    "this study represents a large systematic census of the embedded yso population and thereby allows statements from a large sample of sources .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper are :    1 .",
    "the mid - infrared sources with 24  @xmath0 m detections and red colors are found to be located close to the center of the scuba cores mapped by @xcite - typically within 15@xmath5 ( less than half a core radius ) of their peaks .",
    "the sources are found to have characteristic red colors with @xmath1-[4.5 ] > 1.0 $ ] and @xmath2-[24 ] >    4.5 $ ] but do not show similarly red @xmath3-[8.0]$ ] colors .",
    "the most deeply embedded objects are found in regions with high extinction , @xmath4 ( 90% of the objects with @xmath1-[4.5 ] > 2 $ ] ) , similar to the extinction threshold for the scuba cores .",
    "still , the red colors are not purely an effect of cloud extinction .",
    "all the scuba cores with high `` concentrations '' have embedded ysos , but also a non - negligible number of cores with low concentrations have embedded ysos making this distinction ambiguous .",
    "a few of the strongest sources in ngc  1333 are not picked up by the above criteria described under point 1 .",
    "- due to saturation and confusion .",
    "the cores associated with those sources can be picked out by their high concentrations and submillimeter fluxes .",
    "3 .   from the above considerations a relatively unbiased sample of deeply embedded ysos can be constructed . in this fashion",
    "we identify 49 embedded ysos associated with scuba cores from the list of @xcite . out of 72 scuba cores 40",
    "are found to have associated mips sources ( including four cores which associated with saturated mips sources not included in the c2d catalog ) .",
    "only 3 scuba cores are found to have more than one mips sources within 15@xmath5 .",
    "the narrowness of the spatial distribution of red sources within the scuba cores suggests that the velocities of the newly formed protostars relative to the cores are low - close to the isothermal sound speed .",
    "this argues against the suggestion that the motions of protostars relative to the ambient cloud regulates the time scale over which significant accretion can occur .",
    "5 .   from the number of scuba cores with and without embedded ysos ( 40 and 32 , respectively )",
    "the time scale of the evolution through the dense prestellar stages , where the cores are recognized in the submillimeter maps and their central densities are larger than @xmath24  @xmath7 , is similar to the time scale for evolution through the embedded protostellar stages .",
    "this result further implies that the observable scuba core stage constitutes a third of the lifetime of less dense prestellar cores , e.g. , those picked up in optical or nh@xmath20 surveys .",
    "the current star formation efficiency estimated from the mass of the embedded protostars and the scuba cores is found to be @xmath33  1015% , similar to the star formation efficiency of nearby embedded clusters .",
    "if we also take into account the efficiency of assembling the cores in the first place , the total star formation efficiency is only a few percent .",
    "+    the survey presented in this paper places important constraints on the formation mechanisms , which should be taken into account in theoretical studies of low - mass star formation . naturally many interesting problems remain which can be pursued using the results of this paper as a starting point : for example a more detailed characterization of the individual star forming cores ( e.g. , studying variations in dynamics from molecular line widths and/or chemical signatures ) and of the embedded ysos ( e.g. , their physical properties / evolutionary stage by completing their seds from near - infrared through ( sub)mm wavelengths ) .",
    "it will also be interesting to test whether the criteria from this paper can be used to build comparable samples of starless and star - forming cores in other nearby clouds .",
    "this will test whether the differing physical conditions in different star - forming regions , such as the external pressure , affects whether a given core forms stars or not .",
    "this might for example reflect in a different value for the concentration above which all submillimeter cores in a given region is found to have embedded protostars .",
    "this paper will in that sense serve as a starting point for such studies and for similar censuses of other clouds surveyed at mid - infrared and ( sub)millimeter wavelengths .",
