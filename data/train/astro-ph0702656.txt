    "interest in the study of supernovae ( sne ) has been significantly increased following the renewed searches for sne in recent years .",
    "now more than 3000 sne have been discovered since 1885 , many of up to them at cosmological distances .",
    "much effort has been invested in the classification of sne , in understanding their progenitors and determining sn rate ( and rates for different sn and parent galaxy types ) .",
    "consequently we arrived at the generally accepted scheme with two distinctive classes of sne : ia resulting from the old stellar population ( deflagration of a c - o white dwarf in close binary systems ) , and sne of type ii and ib / c whose ancestors are young massive stars ( died in a core - collapse explosion ) .    historically , classification of sne , according to their optical spectra , began by recognizing sne i , with no hydrogen lines , and sne ii which do show hydrogen in their spectra .",
    "in addition , sne ii were shown to exhibit much wider photometric behavior than sne i , which seemed to be a rather homogeneous class of objects .",
    "nevertheless , it was shown later that there are actually two spectroscopically and photometrically distinct subclasses of sne i : ia which were only located in ellipticals , and ib found in hii regions and spiral arms , which strongly suggested that their progenitors were massive young stars with their hydrogen envelopes stripped .",
    "the third subclass , sne ic , discovered later , show no helium lines either , and thus corresponds to the massive stars stripped of their h and he envelopes . for more detailed review",
    ".    there are suggestions that the sne ii are connected to early b stars , and sne ib / c to isolated o or wolf - rayet ( w - r ) stars .",
    "however , little or no effort was made to further separate sne ib from ic . in the subsequent analysis we will use assumed sn rates for different sn types in spiral galaxies in an attempt to perform this task .",
    "an alternative , according to which all core - collapse sne result from the same progenitor population is also discussed .",
    "the first constraints on the masses of supernova progenitors were put by kennicutt@xcite , and later by van den bergh@xcite , from the assumed supernova and star formation rates ( snr and sfr , respectively ) for the core - collapse supernovae and their progenitors . because of the short life of massive stars , the number of core - collapse events per century should be equal to the number of new born stars in the same time period , within the appropriate mass range , @xmath4 when converted to appropriate units .",
    "star formation rate for the stars in the mass range from @xmath5 to @xmath6 is given with @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the initial mass function ( imf ) , @xmath9 in salpeter s form@xcite .",
    "according to ref .",
    "6 progenitors of sn ii have masses @xmath10 , corresponding to early b stars , whereas isolated o or w - r stars with @xmath11 become sn ib . sn ic were not recognized separately from ib at that time ..",
    "@xcite ]    in order to calculate the limiting masses for sn ib / c progenitors from the mass spectrum of star formation we need to know the imf and the snrs for these particular classes of sne .",
    "we will adopt , as the authors cited , the miller ",
    "scalo mass function with @xmath12,@xcite upper mass limit for the core - collapse sn progenitors of @xmath13 , and the fixed predetermined lower limit of @xmath14 , consistent with theory.@xcite recently determined supernova rates , i.e relative numbers that we are interested in , are given in table 1 .",
    "snrs for a given sn and galaxy type is defined as : @xmath15 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the number of sne discovered in a given sample of galaxies during the total control time @xmath17 , and supernova unit is @xmath18 per @xmath19 per century .",
    "total control time incorporates galaxy luminosity as a normalization factor , since it has been shown that it correlates with the snr , and the probability of sn detection , depending on the photometric properties of sn type in question ( see refs .",
    "3 , 10 ) .",
    "our intent was to use entirely the study given in ref .",
    "10 since it provides a well defined control time .",
    "control time is of utmost importance for correct determination of the snr , which implies exclusion of all sne discovered by chance for which @xmath17 is undefinable .",
    "however , statistics were not large enough to separate stripped - envelope sne , that , for this reason , were lumped together as ib / c in refs . 10 and 11 .",
    "nonetheless , the majority of sne ib / c , as new types , were discovered in systematic sn searches , which means that , although unknown to us , there is a control time calculable .",
    "the crucial thing is that this control time is the same for sne ib and ic , which are photometrically indistinguishable ( or , at least , very much alike ) ! in other words ,",
    "the selection effects acting on sne ib / c would be the same and therefore , for this initial study , we can assume @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total number of recorded sne . as a database we used the october 2004 version of the asiago supernova catalogue ( hereafter asc).@xcite a cutoff at redshift",
    "@xmath22 has been induced to make the results consistent with the rates in the local universe .",
    "the resulting numbers are given in the last column of table 1 .",
    "if we adopt that approximately 83 per cent of all core - collapse events are sne ii and only 6 and 11 per cent are sne ib and ic respectively , from @xmath23 @xmath24 we obtain @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27others include types sm , irregulars and peculiars .",
    "+ @xmath28the ratio for @xmath29 is 0.51 , and 0.55 for @xmath30 , and thus it is not effected by galaxy inclination .",
    "+ @xmath31this high value is probably a consequence of the small - number statistics .",
    "if one uses near infrared ( k band ) instead of b luminosity of a galaxy as a better tracer of its stellar mass , then supernova rate per unit mass ( snum ) can be calculated.@xcite initial mass values for the progenitors of different types of core - collapse sne as a function of the host galaxy s hubble type , obtained by using rates in snum from ref .",
    "13 , are given in table 2 .",
    "the numbers in table 2 are probably too limited by a small number statistics to be useful , but the mean values @xmath32 , @xmath33 , roughly match those obtained previously .",
    "these initial mass values correspond to the massive short - lived o stars . if these are truly progenitors of sne ib / c they will die not far from the place where they were born . table 3 gives the number of o stars of different subclass out of , or in the h ii regions .",
    "it shows that early o stars are more likely to be located in h ii regions than the late o stars , with o8 being the intermediate class .",
    "the explanation of why this transition like occurrence happens at about class o8 we offer at fig.1 .",
    "the figure gives the average lifetime of stars in the mass range @xmath34 .",
    "for classes later that o8 the lifetime @xmath35 starts to significantly increase , which gives them enough time to abandon their birthplace .    .",
    "for the relation adopted see ref . 14 . ]    the closest match to the obtained value for @xmath36 are exactly o8 stars with @xmath37 ( from allen s astrophysical quantities , ref .",
    "15 ) . given the uncertainties in the snrs we may adopt the latter value as the lower limit for the stripped - envelope core - collapse progenitors .",
    "the ic progenitors would then correspond to the stars earlier than o7 with masses @xmath38 .",
    "theoretical models for a single non - rotating star predict a much higher minimum sn ib progenitor mass , @xmath39.@xcite rotation seems to lower this value , @xmath40@xcite , which is consistent with the empirical value obtained here . on the other hand , the amount of mass loss suffered during the star s life , which will ultimately determine the type of supernova , depends also on metallicity , and so does the minimum mass.@xcite these three parameters : mass , metallicity and rotation , are the most important in single star supernova models .    a stronger association of sne ib / c and hii regions , that might be expected if their progenitors are very massive stars , is , however , questionable,@xcite and along with it the single star scenario .",
    "alternatively , stripped - envelope sne may appear in close binary systems ( cbs ) as a consequence of the roche lobe overflow and the process of mass transfer to the companion star .    according to ref .",
    "20 , presupernovae of sne ic thus may be the c - o stars in cbs , formed after the two stages of mass transfer during which h and he envelopes , respectively , had been lost .",
    "similarly , sne ib may have progenitors in the he stars in cbs ( i.e. only the first stage of mass transfer had been invoked).@xcite    principally , sne ib / c would then result from the same progenitor population as most of the sne ii .",
    "intuitively , however , ic may again be resulting from the more massive stars .",
    "very provisionally we may assume that , if the mass range for core - collapse sne @xmath41 , is to be applied to the stripped - envelopes , from @xmath42 @xmath43 would be around @xmath44 ( about class b2 ) .",
    "this is highly uncertain since there are many other important parameters that must be taken into account for determining the presupernova formation rate in cbs , such as the proximity of the companion ( and rotation and metalicity , important for a single star also ) .",
    "consequently there may be a considerable overlap in the initial masses for these events .",
    "perhaps these additional parameters may also be related to the progenitor s mass , however , this demands a more detailed and rather complicated analysis dealing with the formation and evolution of cbs .",
    "what ever the exact supernova scenario is , only from the low ib / c snr and the slope of the imf , it may be conjectured that these are quite rare events .",
    "we can simply follow the line of reasoning : rare events  unique physics ",
    "tight constrains on progenitors .",
    "all supernovae , with the exception of some ic ( hypernovae ) , are commonly believed to release about @xmath45 ergs in the form of kinetic energy ( excluding the neutrinos ) . in the case of the hypernovae",
    "this number is believed to be larger , @xmath46 ergs .",
    "only about 1 per cent of this energy is transformed into light and radiated in a sn event .    since this energy can be regarded as the released gravitational potential energy of a star , it directly depends on the presupernova s mass .",
    "sne of a wide - mass - range progenitors are thus likely to have a wider intrinsic luminosity distribution ( such as it is with sne ii ) .",
    "tight constraints on progenitors ( their mass , metalicity , binarity , etc . ) and a unique physics of explosion means a smaller dispersion in observational properties .",
    "this may apply to the luminosity of sne ib and sne ic .",
    "a sample of latter would , however , still comprise the true hypernovae of @xmath47 stars .    for the absolute magnitude at maximum ( blue ) light we can generally write @xmath48 where @xmath49 is apparent magnitude , @xmath50 } + 25 $ ] is distance modulus , @xmath51 and @xmath52 are galactic extinction and extinction in parent galaxy , respectively . ref .",
    "22 gives the peak magnitude for ib , uncorrected for parent galaxy extinction @xmath53 .",
    "this is consistent with the mean magnitude @xmath54 obtained from chosen sample of sne ib / c from the asc ( see table 4 ) .",
    "the mean error adopted in ref .",
    "22 , however , seems too optimistic . since no extinction corrections were made , this value , although it may be statistically useful , is surely fainter than the true ( intrinsic ) magnitude .",
    "the problem of extinction is the most important issue to be dealt with , in the process of obtaining true sn luminosities ( absolute magnitudes ) .",
    "the plane - parallel model which gives absorption dependent on galaxy inclination @xmath55 , widely used in the past , was shown not to describe extinction adequately.@xcite an alternative model which introduces radial dependence was given in ref .",

    ", width=453 ]    fig 2 shows peak magnitude uncorrected for parent galaxy extinction against the radial position of sn @xmath57 in the units of galactic radius @xmath58 .",
    "the figure shows that there is a certain trend of dimmer sne with decreasing radius .",
    "if we assume that at @xmath59 extinction is negligible intrinsic absolute magnitude for ib / c sne would be closer to @xmath60 .    it can also be seen on fig 2 that sne ic do show larger dispersion .",
    "the sne that show the largest deviations are 1994i , 1998bw and 2002ap .",
    "there are suggestions that sn 2002ap , together with 1997ef and 1998bw , might even form a new subclass i d ( they may correspond to the hypernovae , connected to the gamma - ray bursts).@xcite probably the best studied sn ic , 1994 i , on the other hand may have incorrect distance caused deviation.@xcite",
    "the aim of this paper was to reanalyse the stripped - envelope core - collapse sne ( ib / c ) and to try to bring them in connection to their progenitors .",
    "if the isolated progenitor hypothesis is correct , our analysis indicates that sne ib result from stars of main - sequence mass @xmath61 , while the progenitors of sne ic are more massive stars with @xmath62 .",
    "if majority of sn ib / c , alternatively , appear in close binary systems then they would result from the same progenitor population as most of the sne ii , i.e. early b stars with initial masses of order @xmath2 .",
    "analysis of this scenario , however , would have to include more details and will be rather complicated , dealing with the formation and evolution of cbs .",
    "the joint ( ib / c ) intrinsic absolute magnitude obtained is @xmath63 whereas sne ic are likely to show larger dispersion from this value .",
