    "when fluid systems are confined in nanoscopic pores or channels , one expects that the phase behavior can be profoundly modified @xcite .",
    "such effects have found an increasing attention recently , for instance because of the current interest to fabricate devices of nanoscopic size and to manipulate chemical reactions in nanoscopic reaction volumes ( `` lab on a chip '' ) , etc . @xcite .",
    "in addition , porous materials with pores of nanoscopic widths are useful as catalysts or for applications such as mixture separation , pollution control , etc . @xcite .    however , such applications often are based on empirical knowledge , the theoretical understanding of confined fluids still being rather limited @xcite . in order to make progress with the theoretical description of fluids under confinement by the methods of statistical thermodynamics , it is desirable to start with relatively simple model systems , where both the geometry of confinement is well characterized , and the relevant interactions among the fluid particles and between the fluid particles and the confining solid surfaces are sufficiently well understood .",
    "last but not least , suitable experimental tools should be in principle available to put the theoretical predictions to a test .    for these purposes",
    "it is hence useful to consider colloidal suspensions @xcite , exploiting the analogy between colloidal fluids and fluids formed from small molecules , but taking advantage of the much larger length scales ( in the @xmath3 m range ) , of the colloidal particles .",
    "such systems allow detailed experiments in which individual particles can be tracked through space in real time using confocal microscopy techniques @xcite .",
    "particularly useful systems in the present context are colloid - polymer mixtures , which can undergo in the bulk a liquid - vapor like phase separation into a colloid - rich phase ( the `` liquid '' ) and a colloid - poor phase ( the `` vapor '' ) @xcite .",
    "this phase separation is due to the ( entropic ) depletion attraction between the colloids caused by the polymers . a very simple model , due to asakura and oosawa @xcite and vrij @xcite describes the resulting phase separation in the bulk @xcite in excellent qualitative agreement with the experiment @xcite . while initially it was thought that mean field theory @xcite accounts very accurately for the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation results @xcite of this asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model , a more extensive mc simulation study @xcite revealed clear evidence for ising - like critical behavior @xcite over a broad regime of control parameters .",
    "when such a colloid - polymer mixture is confined by hard walls , also a depletion attraction of the colloids and the walls occurs @xcite and can cause ( in semi - infinite geometry @xcite ) the formation of wetting layers @xcite . due to the very low interfacial tension between unmixed phases @xcite ,",
    "thermally activated capillary - wave fluctuations @xcite are readily observable in experiment @xcite and simulation @xcite .",
    "the phase behavior of colloid - polymer mixtures in confinement can be also studied experimentally .",
    "therefore , this issue has been addressed in recent computer simulation studies , considering the confinement of colloid - polymer mixtures by two parallel hard walls a distance @xmath4 apart @xcite .",
    "these studies have confirmed the fact that lateral phase separation in a thin film geometry exhibits a critical behavior belonging to the class of the two - dimensional ising model @xcite .",
    "also the the scaling relations of fisher and nakanishi @xcite have been verified . unlike the case of confinement of small molecule fluids in nanopores , the size of the particles in colloidal fluids by far exceeds",
    "the scale of the atomistic corrugation of the pore walls , and hence the effects of this corrugation on the packing of particles near the walls @xcite need not be considered here .",
    "a very useful aspect of colloidal suspensions is that interactions among such particles can be tuned by suitable surface treatment @xcite .",
    "e.g. , a short - range repulsion between colloidal particles often is created by coating them with a polymer brush @xcite .",
    "similarly , one could cancel ( partially or completely ) the depletion attraction of colloids towards a hard wall by coating the latter with a polymer brush , choosing the grafting density and chain length of these flexible polymers appropriately . in a colloid - polymer mixture , however , for moderate chain stretching in the polymer brush the polymers in the solution still can penetrate into the brush , experiencing hence a much weaker interaction than the colloidal particles .",
    "only for strongly stretched chains , as occurring in very dense polymer brushes @xcite , a repulsion of the polymer coils in the solution would result as well , even if the chemical nature of the polymers in the solution and in the brush is identical ( `` autophobicity effect '' @xcite ) .",
    "this tunability of the wall - colloid interactions opens the possibility to realize a situation of a slit pore with asymmetric walls : suppose the left wall is simply a hard wall , attractive for the colloids , and the right wall a coated hard wall , repulsive for the colloids ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) @xcite . with a colloid - polymer mixture confined between such asymmetric walls ,",
    "the possibility arises to realize the `` interface localization transition '' @xcite .",
    "this transition is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . here",
    ", the so - called `` polymer reservoir packing fraction '' is defined by @xmath5 ( with @xmath6 and @xmath7 the radius and the chemical potential of the polymers , respectively ) and plays the role of inverse temperature when we compare the behavior to that of a fluid of small molecules that undergoes a liquid - vapor transition .",
    "while in the bulk colloid - polymer mixture phase separation sets in when the variable @xmath8 exceeds the critical value @xmath9 , this transition is rounded in the thin film . starting out from a layer enriched with colloids on the left wall and enriched with polymers at the right wall , a stratified domain structure forms , with a domain wall separating the colloid - rich phase in the left part and the polymer - rich phase in the right part of the slit pore ( state bi in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . only at a much larger value @xmath10",
    "a sharp phase transition occurs in the thin film , with the colloid - polymer interface being bound either to the right wall ( phase b iia ) or to the left wall ( phase b iib ) . along the line",
    "@xmath11 these two phases may coexist .    of course , in an experiment one does not have at one s disposal the intensive variables @xmath3 and the `` polymer reservoir packing fraction '' @xmath8 , but rather the volume fractions of colloids and polymers , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the volume of the system , @xmath14 the radius of the spherical colloidal particles , and @xmath15 , @xmath16 are the particle numbers of colloids and polymers , respectively . since @xmath17 , @xmath18 are densities of extensive thermodynamic variables , the first order transition lines @xmath19 in the plane of variables @xmath17 , @xmath18 are split into two phase coexistence regions . bringing the thin film from the one - phase region to inside the two - phase region ( e.g.  by adding polymers to the solution ) , one creates a state of the slit pore where in parts of the system",
    "the interface is bound to the left wall and in other parts it is bound to the right wall .",
    "these phases are then separated by interfaces running across the film from the left to the right wall ( or vice versa ) . a similar phase coexistence between the two phases",
    "ai , aii occurs in the case of capillary condensation - like transitions for symmetric walls ( left part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "as always , the amounts of the coexisting phases is controlled by the lever rule .    in the limit @xmath20 of the film thickness , we recover a semi - infinite system and then wetting transitions are expected to occur , so that , in the symmetric wall case , in the region @xmath21 for @xmath22 both walls are ( completely ) wet , while for @xmath23 the walls are nonwet ( `` incomplete wetting '' @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the colloid - rich surface enrichment layers indicated for the phase aii are the precursors of wetting layers that appear when @xmath24 . of course ,",
    "no ( infinitely thick @xcite ) true wetting layer fits into a thin film of finite thickness @xmath4 , and thus the wetting transition at @xmath25 ( which we have assumed to be of second order @xcite ) is rounded off in the thin film .    for asymmetric walls in the limit @xmath20 the wetting transitions at both walls will occur , in general , for different values of @xmath8 at both walls . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] we have arbitrarily assumed that @xmath26 . in the simplistic ising model with `` competing surface magnetic fields '' @xcite @xmath27 and @xmath28 , one can consider a situation with @xmath29 , where these transitions then coincide , @xmath30 .",
    "however , such a special symmetry never is expected for a colloid - polymer mixture ( which has an asymmetric phase diagram already in the bulk ) . note , however , that for @xmath20 one does not expect that for interface localization transitions @xmath31 converges to the bulk critical point , @xmath9 : rather one expects a convergence towards the wetting transition which is closest to the bulk transition @xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we shall present evidence from monte carlo simulations that the scenario sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] is correct , and we shall characterize the behavior of colloid - polymer mixtures confined by asymmetric walls in detail , considerably extending preliminary work @xcite .",
    "extensive results for the case of symmetric walls have been presented earlier @xcite . as in previous studies in the bulk",
    "@xcite the simulations are carried out mostly in the grand - canonical ensemble , using a dedicated grand - canonical cluster algorithm @xcite together with re - weighting schemes such as successive umbrella sampling @xcite .",
    "phase transitions are analyzed by finite size scaling methods @xcite , varying suitably the lateral linear dimensions @xmath32 along the walls . for a description of these techniques ,",
    "the reader should consult our earlier work @xcite .    in sec .",
    "ii we now present a study of the `` soft mode '' phase @xcite bi for a relatively thick film ( thickness @xmath2 colloid diameters ) .",
    "such phases with delocalized interfaces are of great interest due to their large interfacial fluctuations @xcite , and consequences of such fluctuations have been seen in experiments both on polymer blends @xcite and colloid - polymer mixtures @xcite .",
    "iii then gives a discussion of the interface localization transition for an ultrathin film ( @xmath1 ) , attempting to verify the above statement that the critical exponents should be those of the two - dimensional ising model .",
    "iv discusses the phase behavior when both film thickness and the strength of the short range colloid - wall repulsion are varied .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v summarizes some conclusions .",
    "all our monte carlo simulations refer to the standard asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model and use the same size ratio @xmath33 as the previous work in the bulk @xcite and for symmetric walls @xcite . in this case",
    ", it is known that the critical point in the bulk occurs at @xcite @xmath34 and also the coexistence curve between the colloid - rich phase ( @xmath35 ) and the polymer - rich phase @xmath36 is known rather precisely , as well as the interfacial tension @xcite .",
    "we now consider a @xmath37 geometry , where all lengths are measured in units of the colloid diameter @xmath38 , and periodic boundary conditions are applied in @xmath39 and @xmath40-directions only .",
    "for the thickness @xmath4 , the values @xmath1 , 5 , 7 , and 10 are used , while the linear dimension @xmath32 in parallel direction is chosen in the range from @xmath41 to @xmath42 .",
    "the left wall , located at @xmath43 , is taken purely repulsive for both colloids and polymers .",
    "as for the interaction between the colloidal particles ( which is infinite if two colloids overlap and zero else , as well as the colloid - polymer interaction which also is infinite if a colloid particle overlaps a polymer and zero else ) , we take a hard wall repulsion , @xmath44 for both colloids @xmath45 $ ] and polymers @xmath46 $ ] . at the right wall , however , we add a square well potential of strength @xmath47 and with an additional range @xmath48 .",
    "thus , the potential acting on the colloids is    @xmath49",
    "this square well potential [ eq .  ( [ eq5b ] ) ] could be realized by a polymer brush of low grafting density and height @xmath14 , for instance , so that the region of @xmath50 where the colloid penetrates into the brush leads to a finite energy penalty @xmath47 only ( note that we use the convention that the temperature @xmath51 ; of course , one could also consider square well potentials of arbitrary range ) .",
    "for the polymers , on the other hand , the interaction is taken to be of the same type as in eq .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) , @xmath52 this potential models the interactions of polymers with a hard wall coated with polymer brushes : under good solvent or theta solvent conditions @xcite , polymers can overlap with weakly stretched polymer brushes with little free energy cost .",
    "it turns out that a phase behavior as sketched in the right part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] occurs if @xmath53 .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] presents some typical profiles of the average local volume fraction of colloids @xmath54 and polymers @xmath55 across the slit pore , for the case @xmath56 and @xmath2 .",
    "panel ( a ) shows the profiles for @xmath57 and @xmath58 , corresponding to a state point where the bulk colloid - polymer mixture is still in the one - phase region",
    ". nevertheless , the profiles of @xmath54 and @xmath55 exhibit pronounced inhomogeneities : the polymer profile @xmath54 displays a pronounced peak close to the right wall , and decays with increasing distance from the right wall to a plateau , almost independent of @xmath50 , in the regime @xmath59 . very close to the left wall , where the volume fraction of colloids is strongly enhanced , the concentration of polymers is also inhomogeneous ( indirectly induced by the colloids , since polymers and colloids must not overlap ) , before @xmath55 abruptly decreases to zero for @xmath60 .",
    "the colloid profile @xmath54 shows a very pronounced peak close to @xmath61 , on the other hand , which can be attributed to the depletion attraction of the colloids to the hard wall .",
    "one can recognize a second peak near @xmath62 and a weak third peak near @xmath63 , these peaks represent the well - known `` layering '' of hard particles near smooth repulsive walls . in the central part of the thin film , for @xmath59 , the profile",
    "@xmath54 is almost flat ; thus the surface enrichment of the colloidal particles at the hard wall is a short range effect . in the regime near the right walls , where the polymers are attracted ,",
    "we recognize first a smooth decrease of @xmath54 in the range where the pronounced increase of @xmath55 sets in . for @xmath64 , where the additional repulsive potential sets in , a downward step in @xmath54 occurs , as expected .",
    "it is interesting to contrast the behavior in panel ( a ) , showing surface enrichment of colloids ( left ) and polymers ( right ) at the walls confining an otherwise homogeneous mixture , with the behavior in panel ( b ) , which refers to a state where in the bulk phase separation has occurred .",
    "indeed , fig .",
    "[ fig2]b gives rather clear evidence for a phase separation in the @xmath50-direction perpendicular to the confining walls , of the type denoted as bi in fig .",
    "the polymer rich phase occurs on the right side of the thin film , and @xmath55 reaches very small values for @xmath65 .",
    "near @xmath66 we recognize inflection points in both profiles @xmath55 , @xmath54 as are typical for interfaces between coexisting phases . again the profile @xmath54 exhibits the typical layering oscillations for small @xmath50 .",
    "no such layering occurs for the polymers near @xmath67 , of course , since the polymer - polymer interaction is zero , the polymer - rich phase is like a dense ideal gas .",
    "panels 2c and 2d illustrate states corresponding to the phases biib and biia in fig .  [ fig1 ] , respectively . in the polymer - rich phase",
    "the interface position is at about @xmath63 , and unlike fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ( where the interface is freely fluctuating in the center of the slit pore ) the width of the interface is only about two colloid diameters .",
    "such a state is typical for a colloid - polymer interface tightly bound to the left wall .",
    "figure [ fig2]d is the counterpart showing the profiles in the colloid - rich phase , where almost all polymers are expelled , apart from the immediate neighborhood of the right wall .    we conclude that these profiles do give qualitative evidence for the existence of all three phases bi , biia and biib in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we now study the phase with the delocalized interface ( bi ) more closely .",
    "in particular , we are interested in how the interfacial profiles change when the inverse - temperature - like variable @xmath8 is varied ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) . defining an order parameter @xmath68 and the coexistence diameter @xmath69",
    "as follows , @xmath70 we choose the average volume fraction of the colloids such that @xmath71 , and we attempt to fit the colloid density profile by a tanh function , @xmath72 \\quad ; \\ ] ] here @xmath73 is the position of the interface center and @xmath74 is the interfacial width .",
    "[ fig3]a shows that eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) provides a good fit of the colloid density profile , for all values of @xmath8 from 0.90 to 1.10 . for @xmath75",
    ", however , the profile is extremely wide , due to the proximity of the critical point in the bulk [ eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) ] , and then the fit is less convincing .",
    "indeed , the polymer density profile @xmath55 , fig .",
    "[ fig3]b , for @xmath76 does not even exhibit an inflection point , while for all larger values of @xmath8 an inflection point clearly is present ( it occurs roughly at @xmath77 , the inflection point of the polymer density profile , which is roughly at @xmath78 ) .",
    "of course , one notes that @xmath54 does not reach the regime of homogeneous `` liquid '' density @xmath79 , since for @xmath80 in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a the layering effect caused by the repulsive wall at @xmath81 already sets in .",
    "likewise , the surface enrichment of the polymers at the right wall distorts the profiles for @xmath82 in fig .",
    "we also note that the profiles seem to have common intersection points ( which do not coincide with @xmath73 , since both @xmath68 and @xmath69 depend on @xmath8 ) .",
    "the common intersection point of the colloid profiles is at @xmath83 , while the common intersection point of the polymer profile is at @xmath84 . presumably , these common intersection points are just numerical coincidences , and will not occur in the general case ( using other choices of @xmath47 and @xmath4 , for instance ) . however , the statistical effort for the data in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is rather substantial , and hence no such systematic parameter variation has been attempted .",
    "figure [ fig3]c shows that the effective interfacial width @xmath74 extracted from the fit to eq .",
    "( [ eq8 ] ) increases from about @xmath85 near the critical point of the thin film ( the estimation of thin film critical points is discussed in the following sections ) to about @xmath86 for @xmath87 .",
    "however , it is important to recall that the width @xmath74 of the interface in the `` soft mode '' phase depends on both @xmath8 and the total film thickness @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "this complicated behavior results because the `` intrinsic interfacial profile '' @xcite is broadened by capillary waves @xcite , but the long - wavelength part of the capillary wave spectrum is suppressed by the effective interface potential @xcite caused by the walls . for short range forces due to the walls , as occurring here , the corresponding prediction for the mean square width is @xcite @xmath88 + \\ ; \\textrm{const}\\ ] ] here , @xmath89 is the `` intrinsic width '' , which should be related to the correlation length @xmath90 along the coexistence curve in the critical region , @xmath91 , while the wetting parameter @xmath92 @xcite for ising - like systems is @xmath93 and the ( unknown ) constant due to the short wavelength cutoff needed in the capillary wave spectrum @xcite can be neglected near the critical point of the bulk .",
    "the intrinsic width should then vary with @xmath8 as @xmath94 with an amplitude factor @xmath95 which is presumably in the range @xmath96 ( it is not accurately known since an unambiguous separation of intrinsic width and capillary wave broadening is hardly possible in interfacial profiles @xcite ) . since for the chosen values of @xmath8 we have @xmath97 for @xmath98 and @xmath99",
    ", we expect that @xmath100 in our case , i.e.  @xmath74 in fig .",
    "[ fig3]c should increase with an exponent @xmath101 . disregarding the results for @xmath87 and @xmath102 , which are too close to @xmath103 and hence unreliable due to finite size effects",
    ", we find that the remaining data for @xmath104 can be nicely fitted to a critical power law with the expected exponent @xmath105 ( see insert of fig .",
    "[ fig3]c ) .",
    "thus , it clearly would be of interest to obtain reliable data close to the bulk critical point , but then much larger systems would be required , and this would require very substantial computer resources , that are not available to us .",
    "but we emphasize the fact that no singular behavior can be observed when at fixed @xmath4 we vary @xmath8 throughout the bulk critical region , passing the critical point . as an example ,",
    "[ fig4 ] shows density profiles for the case @xmath2 , @xmath106 and three values of @xmath8 close to @xmath103 [ eq .  ( [ eq1 ] ) ] .",
    "one sees that profiles for @xmath8 slightly above @xmath103 and slightly below it are hardly distinct from each other , all changes with respect to @xmath8 are very gradual .",
    "a very interesting property is the correlation function of the colloidal particles in the interfacial region , @xmath107 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "if we were to consider an unconfined interface , the capillary wave fluctuations would cause a power law decay of these fluctuations . due to the confinement",
    ", the interface feels an effective potential , and this leads to the existence of a finite correlation length @xmath108 of interfacial fluctuations , as discussed extensively in the literature @xcite . in simulations of a model for a symmetrical polymer mixture confined between competing walls , this correlation length was studied as a function of film thickness .",
    "here we rather study this quantity as the interface localization transition is approached .",
    "figure [ fig5]a shows that the radial distribution function of colloidal particles in the interfacial regions is well described by the formula @xmath109 equation ( [ eq11 ] ) was also shown to work very well in the case of the symmetric polymer mixture @xcite .",
    "when @xmath8 approaches the value @xmath110 , one sees a strong increase of @xmath108 , reflecting the expected critical divergence of @xmath108 at the interface localization transition [ which occurs at about @xmath111 .",
    "arguments have been given to show that for large enough @xmath4 there is a region of mean - field like behavior , where @xmath112 with @xmath113 , while very close to @xmath110 the critical behavior should fall in the class of the two - dimensional ising model @xcite , @xmath114 .",
    "however , the accuracy of the data in fig .",
    "[ fig5]b does not warrant an analysis of this crossover behavior .",
    "following the procedures used in our earlier study of capillary condensation in the ao model , we carried out a finite size scaling analysis of the model with @xmath115 for a slit pore which is only @xmath1 colloid diameters thick .",

    "note that unlike fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , @xmath170 was not subtracted from @xmath167 , thus the bulk coexistence is not simply the ordinate axis as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but rather a nontrivial curve ( which actually is not very different from a straight line ) . while for @xmath171 there is still a small but systematic offset between the curves @xmath172 and @xmath170 , for @xmath115 and @xmath173 the offset is almost negligibly small . the part of the curves @xmath174 to the left of @xmath10 represents the state bi in the schematic phase diagram , fig",
    ".  [ fig1 ] , where a delocalized interface occurs in the center of the film , separating the colloid - rich phase adjacent to the left wall and the polymer - rich phase adjacent to the right wall .    at this point , we return to the density profiles at phase coexistence , and compare them for the same choice of @xmath8 and @xmath2 , but different values of @xmath47 , @xmath171 and @xmath175 ( fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ) . for @xmath176 ,",
    "the vapor - like phase reaches the same polymer density for both choices of @xmath47 ; the main difference concerns the colloid - rich side of the systems , the colloid enrichment at the hard wall is more pronounced for @xmath175 than for @xmath171 .",
    "however , in the liquid - like colloid - rich phase the behavior is just the other way round : the layered profiles of the colloid - rich phase near the hard all are virtually identical , while the polymer enrichment near the right wall is more pronounced for @xmath173 than for @xmath171 .",
    "when one studies the effect of varying @xmath47 in the one phase region for @xmath177 however , one sees only a minor effect of @xmath47 on the segregated structure where an interface has formed parallel to the walls ( fig .",
    "[ fig15]b and [ fig15]d ) , in particular for not extremely thin films .",
    "in this paper , the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model for colloid - polymer mixtures for a size ratio of polymers to colloids @xmath0 was studied by monte carlo simulation , considering thin films of thickness @xmath1 to @xmath2 colloid diameters and confinement between asymmetric walls .",
    "one wall is simply a repulsive hard wall , to which the colloidal particles are attracted via depletion forces ; the other wall exerts a square - well - type repulsive interaction ( of the range of the colloid ratio , and variable strength @xmath178 to 4.0 , in units of @xmath179 ) .",
    "this study complements our earlier work on the ao model in the bulk , and under confinement between two equivalent hard walls , where capillary - condensation like phenomena occur ; for the present model , we can smoothly interpolate from capillary condensation - like behavior for small @xmath47 ( e.g.  @xmath180 or 1.0 ) , when both walls show some ( though unequal ) surface enrichment of colloids , to interface localization - type transitions , occurring for large @xmath47 ( e.g.  for @xmath47 varying from @xmath181 to @xmath182 ) . in the latter case ,",
    "only the hard wall attracts colloids while the other wall attracts polymers . in this region , for large @xmath4 the precise value of @xmath47 has little effect on the observed density profiles .",
    "when one then increases the polymer reservoir packing fraction @xmath8 ( which plays an analogous role as the inverse temperature does for thermally driven phase separation in small molecules mixtures ) , one observes that the enrichment layers of colloids and polymers at the walls gradually transform into two domains of coexisting colloid - rich and polymer - rich phases , separated by an interface parallel to the confining walls .",
    "we find that the temperature dependence of the width of this interface is considerably weaker than that of the bulk correlation length ( or `` intrinsic '' interfacial width , respectively ) , and account for this finding in terms of capillary wave broadening of the interface .",
    "however , since for @xmath183 the interface profiles are strongly affected by layering of colloids near the hard wall , study of this broadening is difficult .    only far away from the bulk critical point",
    "can a sharp phase transition be observed , which we analyze by finite size scaling methods .",
    "while for @xmath1 and not too large @xmath47 the critical value @xmath110 can be rather accurately determined , and evidence can be found that the critical behavior falls in the universality class of the two - dimensional ising model , for larger @xmath4 and/or larger @xmath47 the monte carlo data are strongly affected by problems of crossover between different universality classes and , thus , @xmath110 can be only estimated with rather modest accuracy , allowing no firm statements about critical exponents .",
    "approaching the transition from @xmath184 , we find a strong increase of the correlation length @xmath108 describing the correlation of interfacial fluctuations , but again the accuracy of our results would not suffice to estimate the value of the associated critical exponent . in view of the fact that even for the simple ising model confined between competing boundaries a clarification of the critical behavior turned out to be very difficult , the problems encountered for the present more complicated model , which is strongly asymmetric even in the bulk , are not at all surprising .    the fact that observation of interface localization does not require very special conditions at the walls , but occurs for a broad parameter range , is encouraging for possible experimental tests of our results .",
    "we suggest that a repulsive interaction acting only on the colloids could be realized by creating a wall with a polymer brush at low grafting density",
    ".    a very interesting problem , not accessible to the present grand - canonical monte carlo study , would be the dynamics of phase separation in such a confined thin film .",
    "we hope to report on such studies of a related model in the future .",
    "schematic phase diagrams of a colloid - polymer mixture confined between two parallel walls a distance @xmath4 apart , in the grand - canonical ensemble where the polymer reservoir packing fraction @xmath8 is used as ordinate axis and the difference between the chemical potential of the colloids at bulk phase coexistence @xmath185 and the actual chemical potential of the colloids is used as abscissa ( upper part ) .",
    "phase coexistence in the bulk occurs along the vertical straight lines at @xmath186 .",
    "the left phase diagram refers to the case of symmetric walls , the right one to asymmetric walls .",
    "the lower part of the figure indicates the phases that occur in these phase diagrams ( shaded regions denote colloid - rich domains ) : in the case of symmetric walls , a colloid - rich phase ( ai ) coexists along the line @xmath187 with a colloid - poor phase ( aii ) . in the case of asymmetric walls , the analogous phases are biia , biib ; biia differs from @xmath188 by the presence of a layer at the right walls where polymers are enriched , and biib differs from aii by the fact that a surface enrichment layer of colloids exists only at the left wall .",
    "finally , a state with a delocalized interface between colloid - rich and polymer - rich phases ( bi ) exists along the continuation of the line @xmath189 beyond the critical point @xmath190 , dotted line .",

    "<S> monte carlo simulations of the asakura - oosawa ( ao ) model for colloid - polymer mixtures confined between two parallel repulsive structureless walls are presented and analyzed in the light of current theories on capillary condensation and interface localization transitions . choosing a polymer to colloid size ratio of @xmath0 and studying ultrathin films in the range of @xmath1 to @xmath2 colloid diameters thickness </S>",
    "<S> , grand canonical monte carlo methods are used ; phase transitions are analyzed via finite size scaling , as in previous work on bulk systems and under confinement between identical types of walls . unlike the latter work </S>",
    "<S> , inequivalent walls are used here : while the left wall has a hard - core repulsion for both polymers and colloids , at the right wall an additional square - well repulsion of variable strength acting only on the colloids is present . </S>",
    "<S> we study how the phase separation into colloid - rich and colloid - poor phases occurring already in the bulk is modified by such a confinement . </S>",
    "<S> when the asymmetry of the wall - colloid interaction increases , the character of the transition smoothly changes from capillary condensation - type to interface localization - type . </S>",
    "<S> the critical behavior of these transitions is discussed , as well as the colloid and polymer density profiles across the film in the various phases , and the correlation of interfacial fluctuations in the direction parallel to the confining walls . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental observability of these phenomena also is briefly discussed . </S>"
