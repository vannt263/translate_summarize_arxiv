    "alternatively , secular mechanisms such as torques from galactic bars , bars - within - bars , spiral arms @xcite , stochastic accretion of cold gas @xcite or mass loss from stellar winds @xcite can contribute significantly to both processes .",
    "feedback is another key ingredient in the star formation and agn connection , where agn winds can blow out circumnuclear gas , suppressing star formation and regulating smbh and bulge growth @xcite .",
    "observational studies of local optically obscured agn ( type 2 seyferts , sy2s ) have indicated that star formation processes can both feed the black hole , via stellar mass loss , and limit accretion efficiency through supernova feedback @xcite .",
    "seyfert 2 galaxies are prime candidates for studying the observational link between smbh growth and host galaxy star formation .",
    "as the accretion disk is enshrouded by circumnuclear dust obscuration , optical signatures of star formation in the host galaxy as well as agn fueling can be investigated .",
    "previous studies of sy2s have revealed that a significant fraction live in host galaxies that are undergoing ( or have recently experienced ) significant amounts of star formation @xcite . using a sample of over 20,000 agn from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data release one @xcite",
    ", @xcite demonstrated that the trend between star formation activity and agn accretion was not confined to the nuclear regions of the host galaxies for luminous agn .",
    "subsequently , @xcite used a combination of sdss spectra and galex uv images to show that the link between star - formation and black hole growth was much more direct for star formation in the central few kpc than for star formation in the global galactic disk . in agreement with this result , @xcite studied 74 galaxies from the revised shapley - ames seyfert sample @xcite and found that this connection is strongest on sub - kpc scales , with a much weaker correlation when considering larger scale ( i.e. , @xmath41 kpc ) star formation .",
    "these place important constraints on the mechanisms by which star formation and black hole growth are linked .",
    "however , these studies suffer from non - uniform methodology for measuring star formation rates and/or small sample sizes .",

    "these quantities parametrize the agn luminosity , smbh accretion rate , and star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "we test whether the connection between agn fueling and starburst activity varies as the projected size of the sdss aperture sequentially covers greater parts of the host galaxy , and whether this relationship is a function of intrinsic agn luminosity .",

    "these plots demonstrate that the radial variations of sfr and ssfr are dependent on the agn luminosity and eddington ratio , respectively . to visualize and quantify how the radial distribution of sfr and ssfr vary as a function of increasing agn luminosity and eddington ratio ,",
    "we have calculated the slope , @xmath45 , of the correlation between @xmath46 in each agn luminosity and eddington parameter bin . for the linear regression fit",
    ", we weighted the data points by the error in each bin , taken as @xmath47 , where @xmath44 is the dispersion in the distribution within the bin ( half the difference between the 17% and 83% percentiles ) and @xmath48 is the number of sources per bin .",
    "we note that the lowest @xmath18 bins have the smallest number of sources , which results in the associated errors being larger .",
    "the results in the right panels of figure [ bin_o3 ] show the same systematic trend . as the agn luminosity increases , the increase in star - formation inside the sdss aperture becomes smaller with greater projected aperture size . at lower agn luminosities ,",
    "the relationship between sfr and increasing projected size of the host galaxy is roughly linear , showing that star formation is distributed over the whole range in radial scales we probe in these host galaxies .",
    "however , at higher agn luminosities , star formation is predominantly circumnuclear : we do not see evidence that the sfr increases significantly as the size of region we observe increases from 1.7 to 3.5 kpc ( the physical size of the fiber radius at the median redshifts from lowest to highest @xmath18 bins ) .",
    "similarly , at high eddington rates , the negative slope between ssfr and projected aperture size further suggests dominant circumnuclear star formation : as the size of the observed region grows , stellar mass is added , but is not compensated by an increase in star formation .",
    "these results indicate that circumnuclear star formation associated with agn activity ( sfr@xmath49 ) only dominates over omnipresent disk star formation ( sfr@xmath50 ) when the agn is very luminous . during such a stage",
    ", host galaxy star formation will appear to be centrally concentrated .",

    "these results indicate that star formation associated with smbh fueling rises sub - linearly with agn luminosity .",
    "the fit could be improved with a more complex model in which both the disk and circumnuclear star formation rates are allowed to have separate functional dependencies on the agn luminosity , but such complexity is not really warranted .",
    "our simple toy model is only meant to show that the data are consistent with a stronger link between the agn luminosity and the amount of central star - formation than with larger scale star - formation .    what can be the physical link between these two processes ?",
    "circumnuclear star - formation in luminous agn can originate from major mergers , as simulations have demonstrated that torques produced by galaxy - galaxy interactions fuel smbhs while triggering star formation in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite have demonstrated that mergers are responsible for triggering the most luminous agn ( l@xmath60 erg s@xmath27 ) .",
    "however , the majority of the highest luminosity agn in our sample falls below this bolometric luminosity threshold .",
    "additionally , the lopsidedness of sdss sy2 host galaxies within the eddington range we probe ( @xmath61 to one ) does not drastically increase , suggesting that mergers are not the primary mechanism for coupling agn and star formation activity in this sample @xcite .",
    "alternatively , @xcite have shown that recycled gas from dying stars near the galactic centers of elliptical galaxies becomes radiatively unstable , causing circumnuclear star formation while also feeding the smbh . as instabilities caused by bars , bars - in - bars , spiral arms , etc .",
    "produce galactic scale star formation while funneling gas to the smbh @xcite , stellar mass loss seems a more likely mechanism for coupling agn activity and circumnuclear star formation in moderate luminosity sy2 galaxies .",
    "we find that the agn - star formation connection is largely driven by circumnuclear starburst activity in local type 2 agn , consistent with @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the size - scale of star formation in local active galaxies appears to depend on agn luminosity : it becomes increasing compact in more luminous agn .",
    "more specifically , the lack of an increase in the amount of sfr as the size of the region probed by the sdss spectra increases implies that star formation is concentrated in radii below @xmath21.7 kpc in these luminous systems .",
    "this constrains the mechanism that couples agn activity and host galaxy star formation , favoring theories that link these two processes at circumnuclear rather than galactic scales ( i.e. , stellar mass loss rather than instabilities caused from bars , etc . ) .",
