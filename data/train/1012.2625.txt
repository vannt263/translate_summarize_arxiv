    "in our earlier work on the development of model  independent data analysis methods for extracting properties of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) by using measured recoil energies from direct dark matter detection experiments directly @xcite , it was assumed that the analyzed data sets are background ",
    "free , i.e. , all events are wimp signals .",
    "active background discrimination techniques should make this condition possible .",
    "for example , by using the ratio of the ionization to recoil energy , the so  called `` ionization yield '' , combined with the `` phonon pulse timing parameter '' , the cdms - ii collaboration claimed that electron recoil events can be rejected event  by  event with a misidentification fraction of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite the cresst collaboration demonstrated also that the pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) technique can distinguish wimp  induced nuclear recoils from those induced by backgrounds by means of inserting a scintillating foil , which causes some additional scintillation light for events induced by @xmath1-decay of @xmath2 and thus shifts the pulse shapes of these events faster than pulses induced by wimp interactions in the crystal @xcite .",
    "however , as the most important issue in all underground experiments , possible residue background events which pass all discrimination criteria and then mix with other real wimp  induced events in our data sets should also be considered . therefore , as a more realistic study , we take into account small fractions of residue background events mixed in experimental data sets and want to study how well the model  independent methods could extract the _ input _ wimp properties by using these `` impure '' data sets and how `` dirty '' these data sets could be to be still useful .",
    "in this article , i focus on two properties of wimp dark matter : the mass @xmath3 and the spin ",
    "independent ( si ) coupling on nucleons @xmath4 .",
    "more detailed discussions can be found in refs .  .",
    "in our numerical simulations based on the monte carlo method , while the shifted maxwellian velocity distribution @xcite with the standard values of the sun s orbital velocity and the earth s velocity in the galactic frame : @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and the woods  saxon form for the elastic nuclear form factor for the spin  independent wimp ",
    "nucleus interaction @xcite have been used for generating wimp  induced signals , a _ target ",
    "dependent exponential _",
    "form for residue background events has been introduced @xcite : _ bg , ex = .",
    "[ eqn : drdq_bg_ex ] here @xmath7 is the recoil energy , @xmath8 is the atomic mass number of the target nucleus .",
    "the power index of @xmath8 , 0.6 , is an empirical constant , which has been chosen so that the exponential background spectrum is somehow _ similar to _ , but still _ different from _ the expected recoil spectrum of the target nucleus ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : drdq - bg - ex - ge-000 - 100 - 20 ] ) ; otherwise , there is in practice no difference between the wimp scattering and background spectra .",
    "note that , the atomic mass number @xmath8 has been used here just as the simplest , unique characteristic parameter in the analytic form ( [ eqn : drdq_bg_ex ] ) for defining the residue background spectrum for _ different _ target nuclei .",
    "it does _ not _ mean that the ( superposition of the real ) background spectra would depend simply / primarily on @xmath8 or on the mass of the target nucleus , @xmath9 .",
    "note also that , firstly , the exponential form ( [ eqn : drdq_bg_ex ] ) for residue background spectrum is rather naive ; however , since we consider here _ only a few ( tens ) residue _ background events induced by perhaps _ two or more _ different sources , pass all discrimination criteria , and then mix with other wimp  induced events in our data sets of @xmath10 _ total _ events , exact forms of different background spectra are actually not very important and this exponential spectrum should practically not be unrealistic .",
    "secondly , our model ",
    "independent data analysis procedures requires only measured recoil energies from one or more experimental data sets with different target nuclei @xcite .",
    "hence , for applying these methods to future real direct detection data , the prior knowledge about ( different ) background source(s ) is _ not required at all_.    moreover , the maximal cut  off of the velocity distribution function has been set as @xmath11 km / s .",
    "the experimental threshold energy has been assumed to be negligible and the maximal cut ",
    "off energy is set as 100 kev .",
    "the background window ( the possible energy range in which residue background events _ can not be ignored _ , compared to some other ranges ) has been assumed to be the same as the experimental possible energy range .",
    "note here that the actual numbers of generated signal and background events in each simulated experiment are poisson  distributed around their expectation values _ independently _ , and the total event number in one experiment is then the sum of these two numbers ; both generated signal and background events are treated as wimp signals in our analyses .",
    "additionally , we assumed that all experimental systematic uncertainties as well as the uncertainty on the measurement of the recoil energy could be ignored .",
