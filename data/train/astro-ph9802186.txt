    "the use of sophisticated software packages for the photometry of stars in crowded fields is now a widespread activity .",
    "routines take a ccd frame , and automatically flatfield it , subtract dark , bias and sky , remove cosmic ray events , restore bad pixels , and finally deliver a catalog of star magnitudes and positions . to some extent , what is left to the astronomer",
    "is to plot color - magnitude diagrams , sort out the astrophysical inperpretation of them , and finally write the paper .",
    "the use of these packages has thus resulted in a tremendous progress in the study of resolved stellar populations , including those in galactic and extragalactic globular clusters , the magellanic clouds , the bulges of the milky way and m31 , the dwarf satellites of m31 , and several irregular galaxies in the outskirts of the local group and beyond .",
    "such progress has been possible thanks to the large size of the analyzed samples of stellar populations , coupled with a superior photometric accuracy .",
    "no doubt such achievements would have been impossible with the old , traditional method of direct optical inspection of each stellar image .",
    "however , relying entirely on the automatism of the procedures can also produce nonsense , and occasionally it really did so .",
    "in this paper it is argued that a straighforward application of some simple , yet basic physical concepts can greatly help the astronomer s work on stellar populations .",
    "some simple tools will be presented that allow one to easily get the required numbers out for both the planning for a most efficient use of the available telescope facilities , as well as for achieving a deeper understanding of the scientific meaning of the data once they have been obtained .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 presents a few basic conceptual tools whose application to ccd photometry of stellar populations is then illustrated in the following sections .",
    "section 3 deals with the overall size of a sampled stellar population , hence with the stellar evolutionary phases that can be investigated given such size .",
    "section 3 also deals with the size of the stellar population that is sampled by each resolution element , hence with the depths ( limiting magnitude ) that can be achieved before crowding effects hamper meaningful stellar photometry . in section 4",
    "several examples are presented to illustrate the practical use of such tools , and section 5 summarizes the main conclusions of this paper .",
    "in a stellar population of given age the number @xmath0 of stars in any individual post main sequence ( pms ) evolutionary stage is clearly proportional to the total bolometric luminosity of the population ( @xmath1 ) and to the duration of the stage ( @xmath2 ) , i.e. , : @xmath3 the coefficient of proportionality @xmath4 is the _ specific evolutionary flux _ of the population ( renzini 1981 , 1994 ; renzini & buzzoni 1986 ; renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ) .",
    "it is the number of star entering or leaving any pms evolutionary stage per year and per solar luminosity of the population .",
    "the product @xmath5 then gives the global rate at which stars leave the ms ( in stars per yr ) , which is very close to the rate at which stars enter or leave any subsequent evolutionary stage .",
    "thus , @xmath6 is also a good approximation the stellar death rate of the population .",
    "the specific evolutionary flux is a very weak function of age , ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath8 , as age increases from @xmath9 yr to 15 gyr , as illustrated in fig .",
    "it is also worth noting that the specific evolutionary flux is almost independent of the initial mass function ( imf ) of the population .",
    "this is because at any age the stars that contribute most of the light span only a very narrow range of masses , around the mass at the ms turnoff , and pms stars span an even narrower range ( cf .",
    "fig . 1.1 in renzini , 1994 )    of course , this is not the case for the number of stars still on the ms , which is very sensitive to the imf , @xmath10 , especially towards the lower mass limit .",
    "the imf scale factor @xmath11 establishes the size of the population , hence @xmath12 . with simple algebra",
    "one can show that : @xmath13 ( renzini 1994 ) , where @xmath14 is the mass of stars at the ms turnoff at age @xmath15 .",
    "2 shows @xmath16 as a function of age for a population with solar composition .",
    "note that for a population 15 gyr old @xmath17 , and the dependence on the imf is fairly weak .",
    "for such a population the number of ms stars in a given mass interval is then given by @xmath18 finally , one may wish to use the luminosity in a given band rather than the bolometric luminosity , because such a luminosity can be more directly derived from the observations . to this end",
    "one needs _",
    "bolometric corrections _ for the stellar population , i.e. , the quantities @xmath19 such that @xmath20 .",
    "these quantities can be derived theoretically from population synthesis models , or empirically via multiband observations . for the reader s convenience fig .",
    "2 shows the run with age of such bolometric corrections for three widely used bands ( i.e. , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 ) from the population synthesis models by maraston ( 1997 ) .",
    "for a solar metallicity , 15 gyr old population one has @xmath24 which allow to replace @xmath1 in equation ( 1)-(3 ) .",
    "the same coefficients in the models of buzzoni ( 1989 ) have the values 2.5 , 2.1 , and 0.43 , respectively . in summary ,",
    "equation ( 1 ) allows to estimate the number of stars in each pms phase , while an integration of the imf with the scale factor given by equation ( 2 ) gives the number of ms stars .",
    "several very useful consequences follow from the simple fact that the number of stars in a given phase is proportional to the sampled luminosity .",
    "a straightforward application of equations ( 1)-(3 ) can indeed tell a great deal about the astrophysical information that can be extracted from a given observation .",
    "there are two ways to estimate the sampled luminosity .",
    "one , especially useful for planning the observations , relies on surface brightness information available in the literature .",
    "suppose the ccd camera has a field of view of @xmath25 , and let the surface brightness , extinction , and true distance modulus of the object be @xmath26 mag/@xmath27 , @xmath28 mag , and `` mod '' , respectively .",
    "the sampled luminosity is therefore :    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the absolute magnitude of the sun in the @xmath31 band .    the second method , most appropriate after",
    "the data have been obtained , makes use of the data themselves . once the ccd frame has been dark , bias and sky subtracted , flatfielded , calibrated , and cosmic rays",
    "have been removed , then the total number of counts in the whole frame ( the sum of the pixel values of all the pixels ) can be immediately translated into an apparent integrated magnitude of the whole frame .",
    "hence , applying extinction and distance corrections one gets the total luminosity sampled by the frame in a given band . the only steps that require some care are sky subtraction and saturated images .",
    "obvious precautions include measuring the sky well outside the object , removing bright interlopers , and using shallow frames without saturated images .",
    "getting the sampled luminosity in this way should be done routinely , for this is the most correct and straightford way to estimate @xmath1 , and this quantity is of great utility for the science to be done with the data .    for the sake of concreteness ,",
    "let us suppose that the camera samples a luminosity @xmath32 , and that the stellar population is @xmath33 gyr old and of near solar metallicity .",
    "table 1 then gives the number of stars in each of a series of representative evolutionary phases .",
    "for the ms the number of stars is obtained integrating the imf from the hydrogen burning limit at @xmath34 to the ms turnoff at @xmath35 , and using equation ( 3 ) .",
    "for example , assuming a single slope salpeter imf : @xmath36 the other entries in table 1 include : the subgiant branch ( sgb ) , with stars from the ms turnoff to the base of the red giant branch ( rgb ) : the rgb itself which ends with helium ignition at the rgb tip ; rgb stars within one magnitude from the rgb tip ( rgbt ) ; the horizontal branch ( hb ) ; the early asymptotic giant branch ( e - agb ) ; the thermally pulsing agb ( tp - agb ) ; the long period variable phase ( lpv ) ; the post - agb phase ( p - agb ) , from the agb tip down to a luminosity ten times lower ; the planetary nebula phase ( pn ) ; the white dwarf phase , from the end of the p - agb phase down to a luminosity @xmath37 ; the blue stragglers ( bs ) ; and finally the tp - agb progeny of bss ( bs - tp - agb ) .",
    "the lpvs are likely to be in the tp - agb phase .",
    "they are not found in metal poor globular clusters of our galaxy ; they are found instead in the old metal rich globulars that belong to the galactic bulge , where they can reach @xmath38 ( frogel & elias 1988 ; guarnieri , renzini & ortolani 1997 ) .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that only objects brighter than this limit could be indicative of an intermediate age population .",
    "lifetimes in the various phases are derived from tested evolutionary models ( e.g. , renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ) . equation ( 1 ) is used for all phases except for ms , tp - agb , bs , and bs - tp - agb . for the ms phase equation ( 6 )",
    "is used . the @xmath39 yr lifetime for",
    "the tp - agb phse is likely to be an overestimate for a 15 gyr old population ( cf . renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ) .",
    "bss are a trace population of merged binaries , and their number / luminosity conversion must be established empirically . for this purpose",
    "the globular cluster m3 was used ( renzini & fusi pecci 1988 ) , while for the bs - tp - agb phase the recipe given by renzini & greggio ( 1990 ) was adopted .",
    "table 1 illustrates that for the given size of the population ( @xmath40 ) several evolutionary phases are well represented , while for others the number of stars is very scarce .",
    "when such a number is smaller that unity it can be used as the probability to find a star of a given kind in the frame .",
    "for example , with @xmath32 the probability of finding a planetary nebula in the frame is only @xmath41 , hence a luminosity @xmath42 should be explored in order to have a reasonable chance to find one pn , in practice , the whole globular cluster family of a galaxy like the milky way .",
    "therefore , table 1 together with the simple relations given above can be used to tailor the observations in order to collect the appropriate number of stars in particular evolutionary phases , depending on the science goals of any specific project .",
    "indeed , for any kind of stellar systems one can chose to point the telescope at a region where the surface brightness is appropriate , hence the luminosity sampled by the camera has the adequate size for the specific science project . equation ( 1 )",
    "can also be used in the reverse direction , i.e. to infer the duration of a specific evolutionary phase from the observed number of stars in the phase and from the sampled luminosity .",
    "for example , the duration of the lpv phase in metal rich globular clusters was derived in this way ( renzini 1993 ) .      to sample an adequate number of stars one",
    "may be tempted to observe a field in the central regions of an object , where the surface brightness and the sampled luminosity are highest . however , by moving to high surface brightness regions crowding will inevitably degrade the photometric accuracy , and meaningful stellar photometry may even become impossible .",
    "clearly , an optimization is required finding a compromise between the conflicting need of securing an adequate size for the sampled population , and the need for accurate photometry of the stars to be measured .",
    "the effects of crowding will depend on the specific code that is adopted , with some codes being better than others .",
    "however , a great deal about the effects of crowding can be understood _ from first principles_.    having determined the luminosity @xmath1 sampled by the whole ccd ( or ir array ) frame , one can easily derive the average luminosity @xmath43 sampled by each pixel : @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the number of pixels in the detector .",
    "the actual resolution element will generally exceed the size of one pixel , and in the case of ground - based observations it will depend on seeing .",
    "the luminosity sampled by one resolution element is then the product of @xmath46 times the number of pixels in each resolution element . in the sequel",
    "the term pixel will be used for short , but everything said for pixels would apply equally well to the actual resolution elements .",
    "crowding has two main effects on the results of automatic reductions of ccd frames by photometric packages .",
    "one obvious effect is the reduced photometric accuracy : the fit to the stellar psf is degraded by the presence of neighboring stars , and the error in magnitudes exceeds that expected from the pure poisson photon noise .",
    "the less obvious effect is that occasionally two ( or more ) stars fall on the same pixel , and the package is not able to realize the multiple nature of the object which is then mistaken as a single star . the former effect results in broadened color - magnitude diagrams and smeared luminosity functions , and one can easily learn how to survive with such reduced photometric accuracy .",
    "the latter effect is instead much more insidious , as it generates false stars that do not have a counterpart in the real population , but may resemble objects with attractive characteristics one may be wishing to find .",
    "let @xmath47 be the number of stars in phase `` j '' per pixel ; for @xmath48 this is also close to the probability that a pixel contains one star in phase `` j '' .",
    "hence , the probability that a pixel contains two such stars is @xmath49 , and the number @xmath50 of such events in the whole frame is : @xmath51 ^ 2n^{\\rm pix}= [ \\bt\\lt\\tj]^2/n^{\\rm pix}.\\ ] ] since @xmath1 is proportional to the surface brightness sampled by the camera , one sees that the number of 2 j - star blends is proportional to the square of the surface brigthness expressed in physical units ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "this _ square law _ can be easily generalized to any kind of star pairs ( e.g. the blend of a wd and a ms star ) , with the number @xmath53 of such `` jk '' blends in the frame being :    @xmath54 ^ 2\\tj t_{\\rm k}/n^{\\rm pix},\\ ] ]    where the second equality applies only to pms pairs .",
    "hence , the number of any kind of two star blends in the frame goes with the square of the surface brightness of the target .",
    "moreover , the number of triplets goes with the cube of the surface brightness , that of quartets with the fourth power , and so on .",
    "this square law uncovers yet another insidious effect of crowding .",
    "the surface brightness of stellar systems can be very high at the center , then falling rapidly towards to outer regions .",
    "therefore , the number of star pairs sharing the same pixel will increase towards the center as the square of the surface brightness , i.e. the `` exceptional '' stars will appear much more centrally concentrated than the underlying light distribution .",
    "one may be tempted to conclude e.g. , that the exceptional stars were produced by a recent burst of star formation that took place in the central regions . a plausible hypothesis that may become a wishful finding .",
    "from equation ( 9 ) it follows that the number @xmath53 of jk blends is also proportional to the square power of the actual resolution .    a safe criterion for accurate photometry states that meaningful magnitudes can be obtained only for stars much brighter than @xmath43 , i.e. , for @xmath55 .",
    "by contrast , there is no way to extract meaningful information on individual stars fainter than this limit , i.e. for @xmath56 .",
    "when this applies even to the brightest stars in the population one enters the domain of the surface brightness fluctuation method ( tonry & schneider 1988 ) , and one had better leave photometric packages aside : the frame is _ burned out _ almost like an overexposed photographic plate .    of course , the quality of the photometry degrades in a continuous fashion as the @xmath46 limit is approached . for example , suppose that in a given frame the photometry of the brightest stars is on the safe side of the criterion .",
    "going to fainter objects photometry will become more and more hazarduous as their luminosity approaches @xmath57 .",
    "along with real individual stars a photometric package will deliver an increasing number of `` jk '' pairs in the same magnitude interval .",
    "when working on such a mined terrain , equation ( 9 ) can be used to estimate the number of contaminants , and it would not be wise to trust the output of a photometric package when the estimated number of contaminants in a given magnitude bin becomes a sizable fraction of the total star counts in the bin .",
    "this criterion for safe photometry can be made even more effective if assisted by appropriate simulations and numerical experimets .",
    "for example , comparing the results of running a given photometric package on a full resolution frame , and then on the same frame with the resolution having being artificially degraded ( e.g. depoy et al . 1993 ) .",
    "indeed , the ability to resolve blends into individual components is code dependent , while ( photon ) s / n will also affect the output .",
    "in essence , a modest effort invested in such simulations would _ calibrate _ the criterion , allowing it to predict with greater accuracy the performance of a specific photometric package .",
    "in this section a few concrete examples are presented to illustrate the use and effectivness of the tools described in the previous sections .",
    "these examples include the extreme cases one is interested in at either the top or the bottom end of the luminosity function , and involve both the frame sampling and the pixel sampling criteria .",
    "these examples are restricted to the case of an old stellar population , but the tools provided in this paper should allow the concerned reader to deal with populations of any age distribution .",
    "the red giant ( rgb+agb ) luminosity function in nearby galactic spheroids can in principle be used to infer whether an intermediate age population in present in such objects , meaning with that a population significantly younger than galactic globular clusters .",
    "however , the presence of objects apparently brighter than the rgb tip ( @xmath58 for [ fe / h]@xmath59 ) can not be interpreted as evidence for an intermediate age population , unless their number is significantly in excess of that of lpvs found in old , near solar metallicity globulars , where lpvs extend up to @xmath60 .",
    "a trace population of agb stars even brighter than this limit is represented by the progeny of blue stragglers , a minority component in old stellar system .",
    "finally , under extreme crowding conditions apparently bright objects may actually be the result of unresolved blends .",
    "table 2 reports sampling information for various location in the bulge of m31 , and in m32 and ngc 147 , assuming a common distance modulus of 24.4 mag .",
    "the sampled blue and bolometric luminosities per  ( @xmath61 and @xmath1 ) take into account the extinction correction assuming @xmath62 ( hence @xmath63 , han et al .",
    "1997 ) , and adopting @xmath64 . the extinction correction accounts for the factor of 2 difference in some of the numbers with respect to table 1 in renzini ( 1993 ) .",
    "the last column in table 2 gives the number of pixels containing 2 rgb stars within 1 mag from the rgb tip , for specific values of the size of the resolution element ( see below ) .",
    "the majority of these events will produce artifact",
    " stars \" brighter than the rgb tip , that might be mistaken for bright agb stars .",
    "the first m31 line in table 2 refers to the central @xmath65 of m31 , an area that was observed by davidge et al .",
    "( 1997 ) with an adaptive optics device with a pixel size of @xmath66 that  using one of the two m31 nuclei as a reference star  allows a resolution of @xmath67 ( fwhm ) . the surface brightness in the field drops from @xmath68 mag / at the center , to @xmath69 at the edge of the observed field ( schweizer 1979 ) . taking into account the square - law effect ( section 3.2 ) , a surface brightness @xmath70 mag",
    "/ can be taken as representative of the filed .",
    "thus , each pixel collects @xmath71 and each reolution element @xmath72 , comparable to that of a typical globular cluster .",
    "the actual population of each resolution element can be obtained scaling from table 1 , multiplying the last column by 0.75 . in particular",
    ", each resolution element contains @xmath73 lpvs and @xmath74 rgb tip stars .",
    "no meaningful stellar photometry can be extracted from such a frame , and the apparent `` bright agb stars '' reported by davidge et al .",
    "must merely be peaks caused by the stocastic fluctuation in the number of lpv and rgb stars per resolution element .",
    "hst images of this central field could be used both to get an accurate surface brightness distribution , and to attempt resolving into individual components at least some of the apparently brightest objects .    moving to less crowded fields ,",
    "let us suppose we observe at @xmath75 from the center of m31 with the nic2 camera on hst . with a pixel size of @xmath76 and a field of view of @xmath77 , nic2 would sample a total luminosity @xmath78 , or @xmath79 per pixel . scaling from table 1 ,",
    "one infers that the nic2 frame should include @xmath80 lpvs . from equation ( 8)",
    "one gets that @xmath81 two - rgt star events in one pixel should also be present in the frame ( cf .",
    "table 2 ) .",
    "as also reported in table 2 , one sees that at @xmath82 from the center the number of two - rgt blends has decreased a factor of ten , while the number of lpvs decreases by a factor of 3 , an illustration of the ` square law ' mentioned in section 3.2 .",
    "when taking into account the actual resolution will be a few times worse than one pixel , one can conclude that nic2 will barely be able to obtain meaningful stellar photometry in m31 closer than @xmath83 from the center .",
    "the @xmath75 and @xmath82 m31 fields were also observed by rich & mould ( 1991 ) and rich , mould , & graham ( 1993 ) with a @xmath84 resolution .",
    "one expects that in both fields two - rgt blends are more numerous than lpvs ( renzini 1993 ) , see also depoy et al ( 1993 ) for detailed simulations .",
    "a better resolution is clearly required , and rich & mighell ( 1995 ) used pre - costar hst wide field camera data in an attempt to improve upon previous ground based observations .",
    "the sharp core and extended wings of the aberrated psf forced them to abandon the psf fitting technique in the very crowded central and @xmath75 fields they observed , and taylor to the nature of the data an aperture photometry approach . in the central field their @xmath85 aperture samples an average @xmath86 , hence photometry of stars of comparable luminosity must be very uncertain .",
    "indeed , rich & mighell admit that they `` can not be _ certain _ that stars brighter than @xmath87 [ corresponding to @xmath88 are intrinsically luminous or accidentally measured bright due to photometric errors '' .",
    "the rather blue @xmath89 color of the detected objects also favors the bright events being blends of rgb ( or lpv+rgb ) stars , rather than extended agb objects that would be rather red . in conclusion",
    ", nic2 offers our best hope to check whether or not the bulge of m31 harbors an extended agb made of intermadiate age stars , and yet this will be possible only beyond some arcminutes from the center .",
    "several studies have focussed on m32 , the dwarf elliptical satellite of m31 .",
    "table 2 shows that the two innermost fields are too crowded for reliable stellar photometry with the resolution available to davidge & nieto ( 1992 ) , each resolution element being @xmath90 .",
    "the situation was far better for the outer field located at @xmath75 from the center , which was observed from the ground by freedman ( 1992 ) with @xmath91 resolution elements . with the average surface brightness quoted by freedman ( @xmath92 , or @xmath93 ) over a field of view of 4000 @xmath94 ,",
    "one expects @xmath95 lpvs and @xmath96 two - rgt blends in the frame .",
    "by contrast , freedman detected only @xmath97 stars brighter than the rgb tip .",
    "however , the _ average _ surface brightness of this field may actually be significantly lower than mentioned by freedman . from peletier ( 1993 )",
    "the much lower _ local _ value @xmath98 can be inferred at the @xmath75 position ( renzini 1993 ) , a value also reported in table 2 . assuming this local value to be representative of the average over the actual field of view , one obtains a @xmath99 times lower value of @xmath100 and a @xmath97 times lower value of @xmath101 .",
    "the apparent discrepancy is at least in part a result of the strong @xmath102-gradient across the field , hence to estimate of the number of blends one should take into account the actual surface brightness distribution within the @xmath103 field of view .",
    "it appears that the issue has been resolved by recent observations with hst / wfpc2 at @xmath104 from the center of m32 , which did not reveal the presence of agb stars so ( bolometrically ) bright to be indicative of an intermediate age component ( grillmair et al .",
    "grillmair et al .",
    "conclude that the optically bright objects seen in previous ground - based work were artifacts of crowding .",
    "hst observations of another satellite of m31 , ngc 147 , have revealed the presence of a population of stars up to @xmath105 mag brighter in @xmath106 than the rgb tip ( han et al .",
    "1997 ) . the han et al .",
    "inner field is centered on the nucleus of ngc 147 , and extends to @xmath107 from the center along the major axis . from table 2",
    "one sees that at the very center of ngc 147 the surface brightness is still low enough for accurate photometry to be done to rather faint luminosities . with an @xmath108 pixel size",
    ", each wfpc2 pixel will sample @xmath109 , and serious crowding problems will be encountered more or less at the level of the hb .",
    "therefore , image blends can be excluded as the origin of the extended agb in this galaxy .",
    "the ngc 147 integrated magnitude within the @xmath110 isophote is @xmath111 ( hodge 1976 ) , and the total blue luminosity sampled by wfpc2 on the inner field is roughly @xmath112 , or @xmath113 .",
    "this may somewhat overestimate the actual luminosity sampled within the stealthy perimeter of the wfpc2 field of view , so @xmath114 seems to be a more conservative estimate .",
    "( the luminosity actually sampled by wfpc2 could be obtained as described in section 3.1 . )",
    "scaling from table 1 one then expects @xmath115 lpvs to lie above the rgb tip , while han et al find @xmath116 such stars .",
    "the large statistical uncertainty comes from the estimated lpv lifetime being based on 4 ( @xmath117 ) lpvs in 47 tuc .",
    "the average metallicity of ngc 147 ( [ fe / h]=0.9 ) is close to that of 47 tuc ( 0.7 ) , yet due to the large metallicity dispersion only a fraction of the stellar population is expected to exceed the metallicity threshold ( [ fe / h]@xmath118 ) above which galactic globular clusters harbour lpvs ( frogel & elias 1988 ) .",
    "finally , scaling from table 1 one expects to find @xmath119 tp - agb stars being the progeny of bss , hence reaching brighter luminosities on the agb than the bulk population of single stars .    in conclusion",
    ", a population of lpvs similar to the ones in old , metal rich globulars such as 47 tuc , appears able to account for the extended agb of ngc 147 without appealing to an intermediate age population .",
    "the gradient in the frequency of bright agb stars can well result from the higher proportion of metal rich stars near the center that was found by han et al .",
    ", rather than from a recent burst of star formation .",
    "the above discussion has also indicated that crowding has so far seriously limited the photometry of individual stars in the inner regions of m32 and the bulge of m31 , while high resolution hst imaging of an outer field in m32 has failed to detect an extended agb . from all this",
    "it appears that no compelling evidence has yet emerged for the presence of a major intermediate age component in any of these systems .",
    "as well known , the best way of determining the age of a stellar population , or to detect an unequivocal age spread , is to access directly the main sequence turnoff .",
    "experience has shown that photometry should reach at least two magnitudes below the turnoff with @xmath120 in order to determine the turnoff magnitude with adequate accuracy ( say , @xmath121 mag , corresponding to a @xmath122 error in age ) .",
    "with @xmath123 , as appropriate for a metal rich population 15 gyr old , the turnoff is to be found at @xmath124 , and therefore one should reach @xmath125 with the appropriate @xmath126 .",
    "this seems to be out of reach even for an heroic effort with hst .",
    "ngst instead will have a collecting area and qe adequate to reach this limit , but let us consider the crowding problem .",
    "for this example let us focus on the outermost of the m31 fields in table 2 , which corresponds to a projected distance of @xmath127 kpc from the center , in fact near the edge of the bulge .",
    "with an absolute bolometric surface brightness of @xmath128 , each @xmath76 pixel of ngst / nir camera ( stockman 1997 ) will sample @xmath129 .",
    "two magnitudes below turnoff corresponds to stars of @xmath130 , assuming the turnoff itself is at @xmath131 . hence , integrating the imf following the equation ( 3 ) prescription , one gets that on average each pixel will contain @xmath132 stars brighter than @xmath133 .",
    "it appears that the main sequence turnoff of the m31 bulge will be out of reach due to crowing even with ngst .",
    "a resolution some ten times better ( i.e. , @xmath134 ) would be needed , something that would require a baseline of @xmath80 m , either with an interferometer , or with a single dish .",
    "the determination of the intial mass function ( imf ) of the galactic bulge is of great astrophysical interest .",
    "it represents a unique chance of measuring directly the lower imf of an old , metal rich population that may have formed in a major starburst some 15 gyr ago . moreover , knowing the imf of the bulge would be of great help in interpreting the results of the various microlensing experiments now under way .",
    "this example focusses on a bulge field @xmath135 south of the galactic center . with a surface brightness",
    "@xmath136 mag/(corrected for extinction ) and a true distance modulus 14.5 mag , the absolute surface brightness is @xmath137 mag/ , or 1.5 bolometric @xmath52 , using @xmath138 . among currently available telescopes and cameras ,",
    "nicmos on hst offers the best chance of reaching the bottom of the main sequence . with a fov of @xmath139 ,",
    "the nic2 camera will sample @xmath140 , and following equation ( 6 ) the frame will include @xmath141 stars . with @xmath142 pixels , there will be on average @xmath143 pixels available for each star , and it may turn out to be very difficult to do accurate photometry down to the hydrogen burning limit . however , this assumes a salpeter s imf slope ( @xmath144 ) all the way down to @xmath145 .",
    "if the imf of the bulge flattens out below @xmath146 , as it does in the solar neighborhood ( gould , bahcall & flynn 1997 ) , then one expects to find @xmath99 times fewer stars in the frame , and there will be over 100 pixels available for each stellar image .",
    "this seems to be perfectly adequate for accurate photometry down to the ms limit , provided the integration time is long enough .",
    "however , given the strong surface brightness gradient , it appears difficult to obtain complete imf information for fields somewhat closer to the galactic center .",
    "simple tools have been presented that may help the astronomer wishing to extract as much sound science as possible from ccd / ir array data on stellar populations .",
    "the main conclusions of this paper can be summarized as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) while planning the ccd / ir array observations of stellar populations in globular clusters , in the galactic bulge , or in nearby resolvable galaxies the total luminosity sampled by the frame ( in @xmath147 units ) should be estimated from the known surface brightness distribution of the target objects .",
    "\\(3 ) on the basis of the frame luminosity the astronomer can estimate with very good accuracy the number of stars in each evolutionary phase that will be framed by the camera , thus allowing one to decide whether the sampling is statistically adequate for the specific evolutionary phases under investigation .",
    "\\(4 ) on the basis of the  pixel \" luminosity the astronomer can estimate with very good accuracy down to which magnitude one can trust the result of individual star photometry as performed by current photometric packages .",
    "\\(5 ) frame sampling and pixel sampling set conflicting requirements , the former asking for regions of high surface brightness to be observed in order to secure a statistically adequate sample of stars , the latter instead asking for regions of low surface brightness to be observed in order to secure reliable photometry of individual stars .",
    "the tools provided in this paper allow the astronomer to proceed very rapidly with the necessary optimization , or realize that a certain scientific goal is not reachable with the available technology .",
    "\\(6 ) after the data have been taken , the frame luminosity should be estimated directly from the frame itself , after the frame has been properly dark , bias , and sky subtracted and calibrated .",
    "this will provide the most accurate estimate of both the frame and pixel luminosity as possible .",
    "\\(7 ) a basic criterion for the limit imposed by crowding states that reliable photometry can be obtained only for those stars that are brighter than the average luminosity sampled by each pixel ( resolution element ) .",
    "experiments that are easy to imagine should allow one to more finely calibrate this criterion , establishing in a quantitative way  and for any specific photometric package  how the photometry of individual stars degrades as this limit is approached , and to which extent star counts in a given magnitude bin are contaminated by blends of stars in fainter magnitude bins .",
    "\\(8 ) some straightforward checks should be made when photometric packages restitute exceptionally bright objects , in order to ascertain whether they are real stars rather than the result of accidental blends of fainter stars sharing the same resolution element .",
    "this second option should be carefully evaluated especially when the surface density of such objects appears to be rougly proportional to the square power of the surface brightness .",
    "\\(9 ) the _ artificial star _",
    "experiments as currently done by standard photometric packages may be adequate to estimate the completeness of star counts as a function of magnitude .",
    "however , they would require to repeat the experiment nearly as many times as the number of stars in the frame in order to assess the extent of the _ migration _ of a fraction of stars towards brighter magnitudes due to blending with other stars .",
    "\\(10 ) an application of these tools to existing photometric data for the bulge of m31 , m32 and ngc 147 indicates that no solid evidence has yet emerged for the presence of an intermediate age population in these objects .",
    "i wish to thank mike rich for extensive discussions  over the last several years  on the effects of crowding on the results of package photometry of local group galaxies .",
    "i wish also to thank russell cannon for a critical reading of the manuscript which resulted in an improved presentation .",
    "i am grateful to claudia maraston for her help in producing figure 2 .",
