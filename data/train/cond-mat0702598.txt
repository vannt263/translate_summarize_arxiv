    "the existence of an endohedral fullerene , i.e.  one or several atoms encapsulated in a fullerene molecule , was originally inferred from an analysis of mass spectra of lacl@xmath2-impregnated graphite and did lead to the proposal la@c@xmath3 @xcite . at present the study of endohedral metallofullerenes m@xmath4@c@xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where m are group ii and iii metals such as sc , y , @xmath8 or lanthanides ce , @xmath8 , lu , is a subject of interdisciplinary research @xcite in physics , chemistry and materials sciences . by",
    "now one is able to produce materials where not only single atoms but clusters of atoms are encapsulated @xcite . due to charge transfer between the cluster and the surrounding carbon cage it is possible to obtain molecular - like complexes which do not exist otherwise ( i.e.  in absence of encapsulation ) and which have unusual properties .",
    "not only clusters with metal atoms of a same kind , such as the sc@xmath2 trimer in sc@xmath2@c@xmath9 are produced , but also clusters composed of different kinds of atoms .",
    "a remarkable case is the production of sc@xmath0c@xmath0@c@xmath1 in crystalline powder form @xcite .",
    "the powder crystal is composed of crystallites where the sc@xmath0c@xmath0@c@xmath1 units are arranged with average space group symmetry @xmath10 . from spectroscopic and structural characterization by nmr- and synchrotron x - ray diffraction experiments",
    "@xcite it follows that the sc@xmath0c@xmath0 complex is encaged as a rigid unit with point group symmetry @xmath11 in a c@xmath1 fullerene of symmetry d@xmath12 ( isomer iii , number 23 @xcite ) .",
    "the center of mass of sc@xmath0c@xmath0 coincides with the center of mass of the molecule .",

    "the two c atoms of sc@xmath0c@xmath0 are located in the plane containing the two @xmath14 axes perpendicular to the long axis of the c@xmath1 molecule and have a calculated distance of @xmath16  .",

    "@xmath19 @xmath18 ) @xcite . in the following",
    "we will speak of this c  c bond as a c@xmath0 unit or molecule .",
    "indeed low energy raman spectra @xcite on powder samples of sc@xmath0c@xmath0@c@xmath1 in a temperature range @xmath20  @xmath21 k ( kelvin ) have revealed the existence of quantized rotational states of the c@xmath0 unit .",
    "the raman lines positions reflect transitions between energy levels of a c@xmath0 planar quantum rotor in a fourfold static potential due to the surrounding c@xmath1 cage .",
    "therefore , one can speak of a quantum gyroscope .    in ref .",
    "the potential parameters of the encaged quantum rotor were obtained from density functional calculations using the vasp ( vienna ab initio simulation package ) code @xcite .",
    "the energy levels were then determined from the solution of the schrdinger equation . within this approach , the raman spectra consist of infinitely sharp lines while experimentally the lines are broadened and have a characteristic temperature behavior .",
    "a reason for this shortcoming is the restriction of the role of the encapsulating c@xmath1 molecule to a purely static body . since the measured transition frequencies are in the range of @xmath22  @xmath23 @xmath18 and since the line broadening is of the order of a few @xmath18 , any involvement of internal vibrational modes of the c@xmath1 cage as well as of stretching modes sc",

    "the latter are of higher frequencies and have been measured in c@xmath1 and in sc@xmath0@c@xmath1 by infrared and raman techniques @xcite .",

    "it follows that an experimental probe such as raman scattering which couples to the encapsulated species in an endohedral complex , in casu sc@xmath0c@xmath0 , also yields information on the dynamics of the encapsulating molecule , in casu c@xmath1 .    in the present paper",
    "we will extend the theoretical interpretation given in ref . and develop a unified theory where the quantum mechanical motion of the sc@xmath0c@xmath0 complex is coupled to the thermally excited classical rotational motion of the c@xmath1 fullerene .",
    "the coupling results from the fact that the long axis of the quantum gyroscope coincides with the @xmath15 axis of the surrounding c@xmath1 molecule . in a given crystallite",
    "the c@xmath1 molecules are randomly oriented with their long @xmath24 axis in equivalent @xmath25 directions of the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) unit cell @xcite .",
    "we call this situation meroaxial disorder ( this terminology seems to be more appropriate than merohedral disorder ) .",
    "we start from a model where at low temperature the meroaxially oriented c@xmath1 molecules in the fcc crystal perform uniaxial rotational diffusions about their long axis .",
    "such a classical motion can be seen as a time - dependent modulation of the fourfold potential experienced by the quantum rotor and causes a temperature - dependent broadening of the quantum levels .",
    "an additional broadening effect is to be expected from the stochastic reorientations of the c@xmath1 molecules among the meroaxial directions which should become increasingly important at higher temperature .",
    "in addition , the stochastic reorientations lead to the appearance of a temperature - dependent quasi - elastic peak in the raman spectrum .",

    "the scattering law is obtained as a convolution of these correlation functions in fourier space .",
    "next ( sect .",
    "iii ) we calculate the correlation functions , using a quantum mechanical tunneling model for the sc@xmath0c@xmath0 complex and a uniaxial rotational diffusion model for the surrounding c@xmath1 molecule .",
    "the rotational diffusion motion of the encapsulating c@xmath1 molecule leads to a linear temperature - dependent broadening of the energy transition lines of the c@xmath0 planar rotor . in sect .",
    "iv we extend the theory to a powder crystal which consists of arbitrarily oriented crystallites , each with @xmath10 space group symmetry and static meroaxial disorder . in the following ( sect .",
    "v ) we consider the case of dynamic meroaxial disorder , describing the reorientations of c@xmath1 molecules among the three meroaxial directions by a stochastic jump model .",
    "this model yields an exponential temperature - dependent broadening of the transition lines . in the last section vi",
    "we give a numerical evaluation of the raman scattering law for a sc@xmath0c@xmath0@c@xmath1 powder crystal where quantum mechanical tunneling of the encapsulated sc@xmath0c@xmath0 units is superimposed by uniaxial rotational diffusion and dynamic meroaxial disorder of the c@xmath1 molecules .",
    "the temperature dependence of the line intensities and of the line broadenings is discussed .",
    "we will derive the raman scattering law where we limit ourselves to the interaction of the incident laser light with the plane rotational motion of the induced dipole of the c  c bond belonging to the sc@xmath0c@xmath0 complex of sc@xmath0c@xmath0@c@xmath1 .",
    "this means that we consider the low frequency part of the spectrum ( say @xmath26 @xmath18 ) .",
    "the sc@xmath0c@xmath0 complex is centered in the origin ( center - of - mass position ) of c@xmath1 .",

    "the c  c bond of sc@xmath0c@xmath0 lies in the plane containing the secondary @xmath24 axes of c@xmath1 and rotates about the @xmath15 axis . in that respect",
    "we will consider the c  c bond as a c@xmath0 planar rotor which experiences a fourfold potential inside the c@xmath1 molecule .",
    "our formulation of the raman scattering law is an extension of the conventional theory @xcite in as much as we describe a situation where the rotational motion of the induced dipole with respect to the laboratory - fixed frame is a superposition of the quantum motion of the c@xmath0 planar rotor inside the c@xmath1 molecule and of the classical motion of the c@xmath1 molecule in the laboratory frame .",
    "we start with considering a single crystal of sc@xmath0c@xmath0@c@xmath1 units with static meroaxial disorder .",
    "we assume that the sc@xmath0c@xmath0@c@xmath1 units are statistically independent , hence it will be sufficient to consider one single representative unit .",

    "[ figc84 ] ) .",
    "the meroaxial orientations of the c@xmath1 molecules correspond to the situation where the @xmath30 axes are randomly oriented along the @xmath33 , @xmath34 or @xmath35 crystal axes .",
    "the c@xmath0 units then rotate in the planes @xmath36 ,",
    "@xmath37 or @xmath38 respectively ( fig .  [ figaxes3d ] ) .",
    "we say that the c@xmath1 molecule is in standard orientation if the @xmath15 axis coincides with the laboratory - fixed @xmath39 axis and the plane containing the secondary @xmath24 axes coincides with the laboratory @xmath40 plane .",
    "the @xmath32 axis forms an angle @xmath41 with the @xmath42 axis , while the c  c bond forms an angle @xmath43 with the @xmath32 axis .",
    "hence the polar angle @xmath44 of the c  c bond with the laboratory @xmath42 axis ( fig .",
    "[ figaxes2d ] ) is a sum of two terms : @xmath45 since the c@xmath0 rotor is confined to the @xmath40 plane , the azimuthal angle @xmath46 measured away from @xmath39 has value @xmath47 .",
    "the distinction of two contributions to the angle @xmath44 is essential .    in the following",

    "the assumption of classical uniaxial rotational diffusion motion as a first approximation to the dynamics of the c@xmath1 molecule at low temperature is motivated by the structural results of meroaxial disorder @xcite .",
    "it is also inspired from the dynamics of solid c@xmath48 in the rhombohedral and monoclinic phases . there",
    "the importance of uniaxial rotational diffusion about the long axis of the c@xmath48 molecule has been probed by muon spin spectroscopy @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and inelastic neutron scattering @xcite .",

    "the polarizability has to be understood as an average over the three meroaxial molecular orientations . in the following we label these orientations by a superscript @xmath55 , @xmath56 .",
    "if the c@xmath1 molecule is in standard orientation ( @xmath30 axis @xmath57 ) , or in orientation @xmath58 , the corresponding orientation - dependent polarizabilities @xmath59 and @xmath60 are equal and given by @xcite @xmath61 while with @xmath62 one has @xmath63 independent of @xmath44 . in the case of meroaxial disorder ,",
