    "stokes theorem is used in many areas of physics , particularly in electricity and magnetism where it gives a connection between the electromagnetic potentials ( _ i.e. _ @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and the fields ( _ i.e. _ @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) . through stokes theorem ,",
    "the connection between the line integral of the 3-vector potential , @xmath3 , and the area integral of the magnetic field , @xmath5 , is @xmath6 the subscripts @xmath7 and @xmath8 on the integrals indicate line and surface integrals respectively .",
    "the closed contour @xmath7 is spanned by an infinite number of possible surfaces @xmath8 .",
    "the contour has a direction of traversal which is determined by the direction of @xmath9 , and this determines the direction of the vector area , @xmath10 , of the surface , @xmath8 , via the right - hand - rule ( wrap the fingers of the right hand in the direction that the contour is traversed and the thumb points in the direction of the vector area ) .",
    "this issue of the directionality of the area in stokes theorem will be important ( but less familiar ) when we move from a purely spatial area to a _",
    "spacetime _ area . in the rest of the paper",
    "we will drop the subscripts @xmath7 and @xmath8 if there is no confusion as to whether the integral is a line or surface integral .",
    "the usual pedagogical examples of involve time - independent 3-vector potentials and magnetic fields .",
    "one common example in cylindrical coordinates is a solenoid of radius @xmath11 , with the axis of the solenoid and the magnetic field along the @xmath12-axis .",
    "the magnetic field for this setup is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the constant value of the magnetic field .",
    "the vector potential has the following form @xmath15 for a contour that is a circle of radius @xmath16 which goes around the solenoid , the area integral in yields @xmath17 .",
    "for the line integral one similarly finds @xmath18 .",
    "thus , for this setup , stokes theorem works out to give @xmath19    the above example is also the heart of the time - independent aharonov - bohm effect @xcite where one performs the usual quantum mechanical two - slit experiment but with an infinite solenoid , described by the above @xmath5 and @xmath3 , inserted between the slits of the experiment .",
    "for example , say one sends electrons at a two - slit set up .",
    "the electrons will form an interference pattern on a screen placed down stream from the two slits due to the quantum mechanical wave nature of the electrons . in this simple two - slit experiment",
    "the interference occurs due to the phase difference of the wavefunction coming from the two different slits , and this comes from the path length difference from each slit to whatever point on the down stream screen one is interested in .",
    "the aharonov - bohm effect comes from placing an infinite solenoid between the slits .",
    "classically one does not expect any change since , classically , charged particles only respond to the magnetic field , via @xmath20 , not the vector potential .",
    "however quantum mechanically , due to minimal coupling , the electrons will pick up a phase , @xmath21 , when traveling along a contour @xmath22 .",
    "now for some particular point on the screen there will be two paths leading from each slit to that point ",
    "call these two paths @xmath23 and @xmath24 . now",
    "in addition to the phase difference due to the path length difference there will be an additional phase difference coming from the line integrals of the vector potential namely @xmath25 .",
    "thus one gets a phase shift of the standard interference pattern of the two - slit experiment , which is given by @xmath26 .",
    "this is the heart of the time - independent aharonov - bohm experiment  that one gets a phase shift in the interference pattern of the two - slit experiment despite the fact that the electrons move in a region which if @xmath5 field free , but where the vector potential , @xmath3 , is non - zero",
    ". a fuller and more detailed account of the aharonov - bohm effect can be found in section 3.4 of reference @xcite . due to the close connection between stokes theorem and the aharonov - bohm effect we have in mind",
    "that the contours and surfaces discussed in this paper in connection with stokes theorem should be those associated with the paths and surfaces of particles in an aharonov - bohm experiment .",
    "the discussion of the previous subsection was in terms of the 3-vector potential .",
    "since @xmath3 is part of the 4-vector @xmath44 , we can generalize the first expression in equation as @xmath45 this generalization was noted already in @xcite and is discussed in more detail in references @xcite .",
    "equation involves both a spatial line integral as well as a time integral , thus making it ideal for time - dependent situations . in the section below",
    "we will make this last statement more concrete by looking at the specific example of a time - dependent solenoid with various contours .",
    "it should be noted that throughout the paper we use the @xmath46 metric signature rather than the @xmath47 signature used in references @xcite .",
    "next , the right hand side of , which involves the magnetic field , can be generalized as @xcite @xmath48 where in the last expression @xmath49 is the maxwell field strength tensor and @xmath50 is an infinitesimal spacetime area .",
    "the signs of the area integrals of the fields of the intermediate expression in can be checked using the expression for the contour integrals of the potentials in in the following way : dropping the scalar potential part of and the electric area integral of one recovers the usual result @xmath51 ; in turn dropping the 3-vector potential line integral of and magnetic field area integral part of , one recovers the standard relationship @xmath52 ( inside the time integration ) .    in the next section ,",
    "we apply stokes theorem to an explicit example which involves time - dependent fields and potentials and which uses the full four - vector potential , @xmath53 .",
    "in this section we study the case of an infinite solenoid of radius @xmath11 with a time - dependent magnetic flux . we first consider a spacetime loop which does not enclose the solenoid . for concreteness and simplicity , we take the time dependence to be linear so that the 4-vector potential takes the form @xmath54 the scalar potential is zero ( _ i.e. _ @xmath55 ) .",
    "this is similar to the expression given in but with @xmath56 .",
    "note that in @xmath14 is a rate of magnetic field strength change , while in @xmath14 is just the magnetic field strength .",
    "the magnetic field connected with the vector potential in is @xmath57 and the electric field connected with is @xmath58 the linear time dependence of the magnetic flux yields the above simple fields  @xmath59 and @xmath4 .",
    "the potential and fields in and correspond to those given in @xcite if the large time limit is taken . in @xcite the linear increasing flux is turned on at @xmath60 whereas the potentials and fields above are linearly increasing for all time , but as @xmath61 becomes large the results of @xcite yield those given above after units conversion .",
    "we begin by first evaluating @xmath64 for these two gauges as given in equations and , on the closed spacetime path shown in figure .",
    "the evaluation of the loop integral @xmath64 for the potential in is split into 6 segments , as shown in fig . .",
    "since in the end we want to connect our discussion of the time - dependent stokes theorem with the time - dependent aharonov - bohm effect @xcite , we will take our paths to be those traversed by a particle and thus the path lengths will be parameterized in terms of the particle s velocity .",
    "we will take the linear speed of the particle to be the same along every path .",
    "in general stokes theorem could apply to paths which are not physically realizable paths for a particle .",
    "for example , even for the time - dependent case one could take a circular path around the solenoid at one instant in time .",
    "in this case one would just get @xmath65 but the circular path would not be one that a real particle could travel .",
    "in addition , one would not touch on the time - dependent nature of this case which , is one of the central points of this article .",
    "stokes theorem with time - independent fields has closed spatial loops when evaluating @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , the time - dependent case has closed _ spacetime _ loops . to create a closed spacetime loop we consider two particles which begin at the same spacetime point , move apart and then",
    "come back together .",
    "we then time reverse the path of one of the particles and add this to the result of the path of the other particle .",
    "this is also the procedure for the aharonov - bohm effect with time - independent fields .",
    "the paths of the two moving particles are shown , with paths 1 , 2 and 3 for one particle and paths 4 , 5 and 6 for the other particle .",
    "the arrows indicate the real directions of travel of each particle , starting from the middle of the inner arc at radius @xmath66 and ending at the middle of the outer arc at radius @xmath67 . to obtain a closed spacetime path",
    "we apply the time reversal operator , @xmath68 $ ] , to the results of the line integrals for paths 4 , 5 and 6 .",
    "the operation of @xmath68 $ ] takes @xmath69 .",
    "the results of applying @xmath68 $ ] to other physical quantities can be found in section 6.10 of reference .",
    "@xcite the oddness of @xmath3 under time reversal ( _ i.e. _ @xmath70 = -{\\bf a}$ ] ) and the evenness of @xmath71 under time reversal ( _ i.e. _ @xmath72 = { \\bf x}$ ] ) implies that @xmath73 = - \\int { \\bf a } \\cdot d{\\bf x}$ ] .",
    "thus the operation of @xmath68 $ ] in segments 4 , 5 and 6 has the effect of multiplying the results of these line integrals by @xmath74 . to get the closed spacetime loop",
    "we add the time reversed paths 4 , 5 and 6 to the results from paths 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "paths 1 , 3 , 4 and 6 cover an angle of @xmath75 , with 1 and 3 going between @xmath76 and @xmath75 , and with 4 and 6 going between @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "the linear speed of the particles is taken to be constant throughout so that the angular speed along the inner paths , 1 and 4 , is larger than the angular speed along the outer paths , 3 and 6 .",
    "the detailed definitions and calculations for each segment are given in appendix i. using these results we find that the closed spacetime loop is @xmath78 \\right ) { \\bf a } \\cdot d{\\bf x } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & - \\frac{b_0 r^2 \\varphi_0 ^2}{8 \\omega } \\left [ \\frac{\\rho_2}{\\rho_1 } + \\frac{4 ( \\rho_2 -\\rho_1)}{\\rho_1 \\varphi_0 } + 1 \\right ] ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in @xmath79 is the angular speed at which paths 1 and 4 from fig . are traversed ; @xmath66 is the distance from the center of the solenoid to the inner paths 1 or 4 ; @xmath80 is the distance from the center of the solenoid to the outer paths 3 and 6 .",
    "it is important to note for later that , when viewed from above , the direction of traversal of the closed loop is clockwise .",
    "the evaluation of the loop integral for the 4-potential in now just involves the scalar potential @xmath81 since @xmath34 outside the solenoid .",
    "the details of the calculation for the 6 segments can be found in appendix ii .",
    "collecting together the results for the time - reversed paths 4 , 5 , and 6 ( which , as in the previous case , changes the sign for these integrals as given in appendix ii ) and adding these to the results from paths 1 , 2 and 3 gives the closed spacetime loop result for the potential in this gauge as @xmath82 \\right ) \\phi ' c dt \\nonumber \\\\ & = & -   \\frac{b_0 r^2 \\varphi_0 ^2}{8 \\omega } \\left [ \\frac{\\rho_2}{\\rho_1 } + \\frac{4 ( \\rho_2 -\\rho_1)}{\\rho_1 \\varphi_0 } + 1 \\right ] ~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] comparing with we see that the two different gauges give the same result for @xmath83 , as is expected for this gauge invariant quantity .",
    "we next calculate the spacetime area integral of the fields _ i.e. _ @xmath84 .      the evaluation of the spacetime area integral @xmath85 , for the fields in and on the spacetime area implied by fig .",
    ", reduces to @xmath86 since @xmath87 outside the solenoid .",
    "the detailed calculations for @xmath86 are given in appendix iii .",
    "we need to combine the results for the spacetime areas associated with the segments 1 , 2 , and 3 with the time reversed spacetime areas associated with the time - reverse segments for 4 , 5 and 6 . from @xcite , @xmath4 and @xmath71 are even under time reversal ( _ i.e. _ do not change sign ) whereas @xmath61 is odd ( _ i.e. _ changes sign ) . thus applying @xmath88",
    "to @xmath89 changes the sign @xmath90 = - \\int { \\bf e } \\cdot d{\\bf x } ~ c dt$ ] .",
    "this means that the time - reversed spacetime areas associated with segments 4 , 5 , and 6 are equivalent to the spacetime areas associated with segments 1 , 2 , and 3 . with all this in mind",

    "we examine the case in which the path encloses the solenoid and therefore the spacetime area has a magnetic field contribution .",
    "we now consider a closed spacetime loop that encloses the solenoid as shown in fig . .",
    "we will use the the results of the preceding subsections and the appendices to perform the calculations . to enclose the solenoid with a spacetime path we eliminate paths 2 , 3 , 5 and 6 and then extend paths 1 and 4 around to form a closed loop .",
    "for the form of the 4-vector potential given in , the closed spacetime loop integral , @xmath64 , can be obtained using the line integrals of paths 1 and 4 ( given by equations and respectively ) with @xmath92 @xmath93 from , one can obtain @xmath94 for this gauge @xmath95 so only the 3-vector potential contributes .",
    "also @xmath96 since the direction of path 4 must be time - reversed to obtain a closed spacetime loop .",
    "it is worth noting that , when viewed from above , the path closes in a counterclockwise sense .",
    "this is the reverse of the closed path in fig .",
    "this will have important consequences when we discuss the  direction \" of the spacetime area associated with the spacetime contours .",
    "next we examine the form of the 4-vector potential given in and , obtained from the form of the 4-vector potential given in by the gauge transformation .",
    "due to the @xmath32 singularity for the @xmath31 4-vector potential ( see equation ) the  puncture \" at @xmath35 needs to be removed using a contour similar to the one used in time - independent case ( see fig . ) .",
    "the contour that we use now is shown in fig .",
    ", with arrows indicating the direction of travel prior to time reversal of the paths 4 , @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "we have contributions from the scalar potential only from paths 1 and 4 on the outer loop .",
    "the results from paths 1 and 4 ( given by and respectively ) with @xmath92 are @xmath99 next we need to take into account the small interior circular path which we take to be of radius @xmath39 . since @xmath100 does not depend on @xmath101 , the results for the interior paths will be the same as those in giving @xmath102 the subscripts @xmath103 on the integrals above indicate that these are the interior half circle paths of radius @xmath39 corresponding to the outer paths 1 and 4 respectively .",
    "we have assumed the traversal of the inner circle is at the same angular velocity , @xmath79 , as the outer circle .",
    "we will see below that this is the only value for the angular velocity that is able to excise the singularity .    at this point",
    "we calculate the scalar potential contribution to @xmath104 . from",
    ", we get @xmath105 \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{b_0 r^2 \\pi ^2}{4 \\omega } - \\frac{b_0 r^2 \\pi ^2}{4 \\omega } + \\int _ { l_1 } \\phi ' c dt + \\frac{b_0 r^2 \\pi ^2}{4 \\omega } - \\frac{b_0 r^2 \\pi ^2}{4 \\omega } - \\int _ { l_4 }",
    "\\phi ' c dt = 0\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] although we did not explicitly calculate @xmath106 and @xmath107 , it is clear that they are the same in magnitude and cancel after we apply time reversal .",
    "the only non - zero and uncanceled contribution to @xmath108 comes from the interior 3-vector part of .",
    "the @xmath109 piece gives the same result as since the extra negative in this part of the 3-potential is balanced by the fact that the inner circular path is traversed in the opposite direction as the outer circle after time reversal .",
    "so we have @xmath110 there is an additional contribution from the @xmath111 term in the 3-potential relative to , but in the limit @xmath41 this additional contribution is zero . from , one can obtain @xmath112 where at the end we have taken @xmath41 . thus by excising the singularity that exists in this gauge we find that the results for the closed spacetime integrals given in and agree .",
    "we note that the interior circular path and the two paths in the @xmath113 direction are not physical paths that the particles traverse , but are simply artifacts used to excise the singularity at @xmath42 .",
    "additionally , as we remarked above , we needed to arbitrarily take the traversal of the inner circle at the same angular velocity as the outer circle so that the singularity would be removed .",
    "this arbitrariness is absent from the time - independent case . in the time - dependent case ,",
    "the  strength \" of the @xmath32 singularity is @xmath114 , and thus changes linearly in time .",
    "we now calculate the right hand side of stokes theorem  the field version of the spacetime area integral , @xmath84 . in this case",
    ", we use the two spacetime surfaces shown in fig . , both of which span the spacetime path used in evaluating @xmath64 .    for the spacetime area that is the side of the spacetime cylinder  the right side of fig .",
    " only the electric field will contribute _ i.e. _ @xmath115 .",
    "we can obtain this electric piece using our results from and with @xmath92 , but with one subtlety : we need to reverse the signs relative to those given in and so that we have @xmath116 the reason for the sign reversal is as follows : when we form a closed spacetime loop from the two contours in fig .",
    ", the direction of the spacetime loop is counterclockwise when the solenoid is viewed from above .",
    "as previously mentioned , this is the reverse of the paths in fig . .",
    "for purely spatial examples of stokes theorem , reversing the direction of traversal for the path reverses the direction of the 3-vector area via the right - hand - rule . here",
    ", although there is no equivalent right - hand - rule for the _ spacetime _ area , we nevertheless need to reverse the spacetime area  direction \" when the closed spacetime path is traversed in the opposite direction .",
    "this might be viewed as an extension of the right - hand - rule to spacetime paths and areas .",
    "one can obtain this result on the  direction \" of the spacetime area less heuristically using differential forms and wedge product notation . reviewing differential forms and",
    "wedge product notation is outside the scope of this article , but the interested reader can find nice expositions on this in the textbooks by frankel @xcite , felsager @xcite and ryder .",
    "@xcite to get the spacetime area contribution associated with the closed spacetime loop in fig .",
    ", we apply the time - reversal operator to area 4 , which changes the sign of @xmath117 since @xmath4 and @xmath9 are even under time reversal , but @xmath118 is odd .",
    "we then add the time reversed result for path 4 to the result for area 1 which gives @xmath119 this result agrees with the results for the loop integral for the 4-vector potentials in the two different gauges , given in and .",
    "we now calculate @xmath85 for the spacetime area on the left hand side of fig . the slanted  top \" of the spacetime cylinder . for this spacetime area",
    ", only the magnetic field contributes _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath120 . for the previous case , shown in fig . , our spacetime loop enclosed a region where @xmath121 . now from the right hand side of fig .",
    "we can see that the spacetime area will have @xmath122 so we expect @xmath123 . for the spacetime area associated with path 1",
    "we have @xmath124 where we have used @xmath125 to write the magnetic field magnitude as @xmath126 .",
    "note that here the area vector points along the positive z - axis @xmath127 .",
    "for the spacetime area associated with segment 4 we have @xmath128 again we have used @xmath125 and @xmath129 . here the area vector points along the negative z - axis ( @xmath130 ) since the path is traversed in a clockwise direction . to get the spacetime area associated with the closed spacetime loop , we add the result of to the time reversed result of @xmath131 = \\int_1 { \\bf b } \\cdot d{\\bf a } - \\int_4 { \\bf b } \\cdot d{\\bf a } = \\frac{b_0 r^2 \\pi^2 } { 2 \\omega }   ~.\\ ] ] this result agrees with the results for the loop integrals for the 4-vector potentials in the two different gauges given in and , and agrees with the result for the spacetime area integral from .",
    "this is reminiscent of the charging capacitor demonstration of maxwell s displacement current .",
    "@xcite in this example , there is a circular loop that encloses a wire which is charging up a capacitor . the closed loop integral of the magnetic field ( _ i.e. _ @xmath132 ) gives @xmath133 .",
    "if the surface chosen to span this loop cuts through the wire then @xmath134 is the current due to charges .",
    "however , the surface can be chosen so that it goes between the capacitor plates where one has no current from charges . in this region",
    "one does have a time - changing electric field and so the contribution to the magnetic field loop integral now comes from the displacement current . here , the loop integral of the vector potential is related to the spacetime area integral of the electric field in one case , and related to the spacetime area integral of the magnetic field in the other case .",
    "in this work , we have given explicit examples of stokes theorem in the case where there exists time - dependent fields ( _ i.e. _ 4d stokes theorem ) .",
    "there are many examples of stokes theorem as it applies to time - independent fields ( _ i.e. _ 3d stokes theorem ) , but these are perhaps the first explicit worked out examples of stokes theorem with time - dependent fields . in fact , there are some claims that stokes theorem does not apply to time - dependent fields ( see the first footnote on page 305 and the first paragraph on page 312 of reference @xcite ) . despite these assertions , we have found that stokes theorem _ can _ be applied to time - dependent cases if care is taken in how the spacetime loop is closed .",
    "in particular we investigated an infinite solenoid with a linearly increasing magnetic flux .",
    "there we showed @xmath135 for the spacetime loop closed outside the solenoid ",
