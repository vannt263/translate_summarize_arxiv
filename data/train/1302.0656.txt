    "the idea of noncommutative coordinates is not new and it was for the first time proposed by heisenberg in 1930 in his letters to ehrenfest @xcite and peierls @xcite . at that time",
    "heisenberg could not formulate this idea mathematically .",
    "still , there was a hope that uncertainty relations for coordinates might provide a natural cut - off for divergent integrals of quantum field theory ( qft ) .",
    "the idea was propagated and in 1943 snyder published a paper on `` quantized space time '' @xcite .",
    "pauli in a letter to bohr mentioned this work to be mathematically ingenious but he rejected it for physical reasons .",
    "later , due to the extreme success of renormalization of quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and/or standard model ( sm ) , the idea of possible noncommutaive field theory ( ncft ) was ignored for a long time .",
    "however at the beginning of 90 s noncommutative geometry was developed , see connes @xcite and madore @xcite and references there .",
    "research on divergences in a field theory on quantum spaces started by pioneering work of filk @xcite .",
    "lately noncommutative coordinates appears in string theory indicating that noncommutative gauge field theory ( ncgft ) could be one of its low - energy effective theories , as proposed by seiberg and witten in @xcite .",

    "those are known as the wess type of models , see @xcite .",
    "studies on noncommutative particle phenomenology @xcite was motivated to find possible experimental signatures and/or predict / estimate bounds on space - time noncommutativity from collider physics experimental data : for example from the standard model ( sm ) forbidden @xmath6 decays , or from the sm invisible part of @xmath7 decays , and more important from the ultra high energy ( uhe ) processes occurring in the framework of the cosmogenic neutrino physics .",
    "constraint on the scale of the ncgft , @xmath8 , is possible due to a direct couplings of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the constraints on the @xmath11 charges , known as the `` no - go theorem '' @xcite , are rescinded in our approach @xcite , and the noncommutative extensions of particle physics covariant sm ( ncsm ) and the noncommutative grand unified theories ( ncgut ) models @xcite were constructed .",
    "the method known as sw map and/or enveloping algebra ( wess approach ) avoids both the gauge group and the u(1 ) charge issues .",
    "it was shown mathematically rigorously that any u(1 ) gauge theory on an arbitrary poisson manifold can be deformation - quantized to a noncommutative gauge theory via the the enveloping algebra approach  @xcite and later extended to the non - abelian gauge groups  @xcite .",
    "the important step that has been missed in a paper @xcite opposing above conclusions , is the use of reducible representations @xcite .",
    "all these allow a minimal deformation with no new particle content and with the sacrifice that interactions include infinitely many terms defined through recursion ( due to expansions ) over the nc parameter @xmath12 .",
    "the perturbative quantization of noncommutative field theories was first proposed by filk @xcite , while other famous examples are the running of the coupling constant of nc qed @xcite and the uv / ir mixing @xcite .",

    "also the sw expanded ncsm @xcite at first order in @xmath0 , albeit breaking lorentz symmetry is anomaly free @xcite , and has well - behaved one - loop quantum corrections @xcite .",
    "however , despite of some significant progress in the models @xcite , a better understanding of various models quantum loop corrections still remains in general a challenging open question .",
    "this fact is particularly true for the models constructed by using sw map expansion in the nc parameter @xmath0 , @xcite .",
    "resulting models are very useful as effective field theories including their one - loop quantum properties @xcite and relevant phenomenology @xcite .",
    "quite recently restrictions due to expansions over parameter has been overcome by constructions of the @xmath0-exact sw map and enveloping algebra based theoretical models , in the framework of covariant noncommutative quantum gauge field theory @xcite , and applied in loop computation @xcite and to the phenomenology , as well @xcite .",
    "namely , an expansion and cut - off in powers of the nc parameters @xmath12 corresponds to an expansion in momenta and restrict the range of validity to energies well below the nc scale @xmath8 .",

    "this gives one more example how such spontaneous @xmath0-background breaking of lorentz symmetry could affect the particle kinematics through quantum corrections , even without divergent behavior like uv / ir mixing .",
    "on the other hand one can also see that the magnitude of superluminosity is in general very large in our model as a quantum effect , thus seems contradicting various observations which suggests much smaller values @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , note that the large superluminal velocity issue may also be reduced / removed by taking into account several considerations and/or properties : + - selection of a constant nonzero @xmath0 background in this paper is due to the computational simplicity .",
    "the results will , however , still hold for a nc background that is varying sufficiently slowly with respect to the scale of noncommutativity .",
    "there is no physics reason to expect @xmath0 to be a globally constant background _",
    "ether_. in fact , if the @xmath0 background is only nonzero in tiny regions ( nc bubbles ) the effects of the modified dispersion relation will be suppressed macroscopically .",
    "certainly a better understanding of possible sources of nc is needed .",
    "+ - we have considered only the purely noncommutative neutrino - photon coupling .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that modified neutrino dispersion relation could open decay channels within the commutative standard model framework @xcite . in our case",
    "this would further provide cascade decay channel(s ) which can , via bremsstrahlung , bring superluminal neutrinos to normal ones .",
    "+ - our results differs with respect to non sw map models since in our case both terms are proportional to the spacetime noncommutativity dependent @xmath0-ratio ( the scale - independent structure ! ) factor in ( [ degen ] ) , which arise from the natural non - locality of our actions . besides the divergent terms",
    ", a new spinor structure @xmath131 with finite coefficients emerges in our computation , see ( [ sigma1ab])-([a2 ] ) .",
    "all these structures are proportional to @xmath102 , therefore if appropriate renormalization conditions are imposed , the commutative dispersion relation @xmath85 can still hold . also it is reasonable to conjecture that sw map freedom may also serve as one possible remedy to ( 23 ) issue .",
    "+ - finally , we mention that our approach to uv / ir mixing should not be confused with the one based on a theory with uv completion ( @xmath132 ) , where a theory becomes an effective qft , and the uv / ir mixing manifests itself via a specific relationship between the uv and the ir cutoffs @xcite .",
    "this is fortunate with regard to the use of low - energy ncqft as an important window to holography @xcite and quantum gravity @xcite .",
