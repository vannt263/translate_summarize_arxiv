    "low magnetic - field neutron star x - ray binaries ( nsxbs ) are often divided in two classes , according to their correlated spectral and timing properties : the `` atoll '' and the `` z '' sources ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 , see van der klis 2006 for a review ) , named after the shape of the track they draw in x - ray color - color diagrams ( cds ) and hardness - intensity diagrams ( hids ) .    z sources are brighter than atoll sources and",
    "are believed to accrete at near - eddington luminosities ( 0.5 - 1.0 @xmath0 , van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "the mass accretion rate @xmath1 is thought to be the main parameter responsible for the differences between z sources and atoll sources but the ns magnetic field strength might also play a determinant role ( hasinger & van der klis 1989 ) . to date seven galactic nsxbs have been classified as z sources : six of them are persistent , one is transient ( xte j1701 - 462 , homan et al . 2007a ; the source evolved to atoll - like behaviour at the end of its outburst ; homan et al .",
    "2007b , lin et al .",
    "they are characterized by three - branched tracks in their cds and hids that in some cases resemble the character `` z '' , in other cases they have a more `` @xmath2-like '' shape .",
    "the branches are called horizontal branch ( hb ) , normal branch ( nb ) and flaring branch ( fb ) and identify three different states . the mass accretion rate @xmath1 is assumed to be the major physical parameter driving the transitions between the states , increasing monotonically from the hb to the fb .",
    "motion along the branches of the `` z '' usually takes place on time scales of hours to days while on longer time scales it has been observed that the entire z track can change its location in the cd and hid or even its morphology ( cyg x-2 , kuulkers et al .",
    "1996 and wijnands et al . 1997",
    "; xte j1701 - 422 , homan et al .",
    "another possibility is that the mass accretion rate @xmath1 drives the long - time scale evolution between different systems ( z source z - like shape , z source @xmath2-like shape , atoll source ) while state transitions are mainly driven by disc instabilities ( xte j1701 - 462 , lin et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in timing studies , z sources show a rich phenomenology of quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) and noise components ,",
    "whose presence and properties are strongly correlated with the position of the source along the z track ( van der klis 2006 ) .",
    "three types of low - frequency qpos ( @xmath3100 hz ) are seen in the z sources ; they derive their name from the branches on which they were originally found : horizontal branch ( hbos ) , normal branch ( nbos ) and flaring branch oscillations ( fbos ) .",
    "twin khz qpos have also been detected in all the z sources ( marginally in xte j1701 - 462 , homan et al .",
    "2007a ) .",
    "all the z - type ns sources are detected in radio ( at variance with atoll sources , see migliari & fender 2006 ) , showing large amplitude variability and both optically thin and optically thick emission .",
    "penninx et al .",
    "( 1988 ) , for the first time , found ( in gx 17 + 2 ) that the radio emission varies as a function of the position in the x - ray cd , decreasing with increasing mass accretion rate from the hb ( strongest radio emission ) to the fb ( weakest radio emission ) . hjellming et al ( 1990a , 1990b ) found a consistent behaviour both in cyg x-2 and in sco x-1 , that according to migliari & fender ( 2006 ) could be universal ( but see tan et al .",

    "migliari et al .",
    "( 2007 ) observed gx 17 + 2 simultaneously in x - ray and radio and confirmed previous results , reporting a delay of approximately @xmath4 hours between x - ray spectral transitions and the radio jet activity .",
    "a similar behaviour has been found in the bright atoll source gx 13 + 1 ( homan et al .",
    "2004 ) , in which a change in the x - ray spectral hardness precedes the beginning of the radio flares by approximately 40 minutes .",
    "the transient z source xte j1701 - 462 has also been detected in radio ( fender et al .",
    "2007 ) when on the hb and nb .",
    "extended radio jets have been spatially resolved for sco x-1 ( fomalont et al .",
    "2001a ) and have also been associated with ultra - relativistic ejections ( fomalont et al .",
    "2001b ) .    c",
    "cir x-1 is a peculiar x - ray binary discovered by margon et al .",
    "( 1971 ) characterized by flares with a period of 16.55 days , observed first in the x - ray band ( kaluzienski et al .",
    "1976 ) and then in the infrared ( glass 1978 ; glass 1994 ) , radio ( haynes et al .",
    "1978 ) and optical bands ( moneti 1992 ) : these flares have been interpreted as due to enhanced accretion close to the periastron passage of a highly eccentric binary orbit ( @xmath5 , murdin et al .",
    "1980 , nicolson , glass & feast 1980 ) .",
    "the evidence that the system harbours a neutron star comes from the detection of type - i x - ray bursts ( tennant et al .",
    "1986a , b ) and the more recent detection of twin khz qpos in the x - ray power density spectra ( boutloukos et al .",
    "however cir x-1 is a very peculiar neutron star system , since it features several black - hole like properties .",
    "it is the most radio loud neutron star system ( whelan et al .",
    "1977 , haynes et al . 1978 ; cyg x-3 and ss433 are brighter in radio but their nature is unclear ) , showing extended jets on arcmin scale ( stewart et al . 1993 ; tudose et al .",
    "2006 ) that probably inflated the radio nebula in which the system is embedded .",
    "it also shows arcsec - scale ultra - relativistic radio jets ( fender et al .",

    "on arcmin scale , x - ray jets have been recently detected ( heinz et al .",
    "2007 , soleri et al .",
    "2008b ) : cir x-1 is the only secure neutron star system in which such ejections have been spatially resolved .",
    "the source is also characterized by a hard x - ray emission ( iaria et al .",
    "2001 , ding et al . 2003 ) and very strong x - ray variability ( jones et al . 1974 ,",

    "1999 ) a complete z track in its high - luminosity orbital phases .",
    "based on the properties of the type - i x - ray bursts , jonker & nelemans ( 2004 ) estimated a distance to the source of 7.8 - 10.5 kpc ; according to a different measure of the galactic absorption , iaria et al .",
    "( 2005 ) derived a smaller distance of 4.1 kpc ( but see jonker et al .",

    "standard calibration techniques were employed using the miriad software ( sault , teuben & wright 1995 ) . for more details on the radio analysis",
    "we refer the reader to tudose et al .",
    "in this section we will proceed as follows : first we analyse the x - ray light curves , the hids and the pds , identifying typical z source features , then we focus on the correlated x - ray / radio behaviour at two particular orbital phases ( 0.0 and 0.5 , periastron and apastron respectively ) , when radio jets are detected .      figure [ fig : licu_pca ] shows the 2 - 18 kev pca light curves of cir x-1 for our data set : in 2000 october the source crossed the periastron twice during the time interval in which our observations have been performed while in our december-2002 campaign cir x-1 crossed the periastron only once ( the first digit of the orbital phases in table [ tab : log_obs ] increases after every periastron passage ) . + the x - ray light curve of cir x-1 is highly variable and in the last decades it has been characterized by periods of very low flux and periods in which strong re - brightening occurred . since a discussion of its morphology is beyond the scope of this paper ( see parkinson et al .",
    "2003 ) , we just note that the pca count rate reached higher peaks in 2000 october than in 2002 december , without further commenting on this aspect . + in some light curves , rapid changes in the x - ray count rate occur on short time scales , up to @xmath93600 c / s ( pcu2 only ) in @xmath917 min ( a factor @xmath97 in count rate ) on 2000 october 19 .",
    "dips are also present when close to phase 0.0 ( 2000 october 19 ; 2002 december 3 , 4 and 5 ) as previously reported ( e.g. ding et al",
    "+ we created a hid both for 2000 october and 2002 december : the source systematically changes its position in the diagram according to the orbital phase , drawing various patterns that , when not close to the periastron passage , do not overlap in the hid .",
    "we have divided the data set in different intervals , that are chosen in such a way that each of them corresponds to an atca observation ( except for interval o , since no radio observations are available ) .",
    "rxte observations that belong to the same interval are usually characterized by consistent patterns in the hid .",
    "this method led to 15 intervals , labeled a to o , marked in the x - ray light curves in figure [ fig : licu_pca ] .",
    "the associated orbital phases are given in table [ tab : log_obs ] .",
    "figures [ fig : hid_oct ] and [ fig : hid_dec ] show the location of the intervals in the hids for 2000 october ( intervals a - h ) and 2002 december ( intervals i - o ) , respectively .",
    "from now on we will refer to the interval names without necessarily reporting the date .",
    "+ the 2000-october data set covers most of the orbital phases while the 2002-december one focuses on the periastron passage , in the phase interval 0.99 - 1.39 . excluding intervals b , c , d and h ( for which there is no overlapping in the two data sets ) , the hids for 2000 october and 2002 december have comparable shape ( note the different scale on the axis , due to the decreasing secular trend of cir x-1 count rate ) .",
    "position and patterns in the hids are strongly dependent on the orbital phase and that is particularly evident around phase 0.0 : before / across the periastron passage the source draws a cloud in the top - left part of the hid ( intervals a , i and part of interval j ) .",
    "subsequently cir x-1 moves in the bottom part of the hid , drawing nearly horizontal strips with strong variations in count rate ( intervals e , f , j , k , l and m ) .",
    "intervals b , c , d , f , g , h , n , o correspond to orbital phases not close to the periastron passage .",
    "they do not overlap with the cloud and the horizontal strips and they are characterized by smaller variations in count rate .",
    "the aim of this section is to test if we can identify z source features in the pds and hids .",
    "we focus on some observations performed in 2000 october , since the associated patterns in the hid and pds are representative of the source behaviour .",
    "we chose 2000 october since those data , differently from the ones from 2002 december , cover all the orbital phases .",

    "<S> we present the results of simultaneous x - ray and radio observations of the peculiar z - type neutron star x - ray binary cir x-1 , observed with the rossi x - ray timing explorer satellite and the australia telescope compact array in 2000 october and 2002 december . </S>",
    "<S> we identify typical z source behaviour in the power density spectra as well as characteristic z patterns drawn in an x - ray hardness - intensity diagram . </S>",
    "<S> power spectra typical of bright atoll sources have also been identified at orbital phases after the periastron passage , while orbital phases before the periastron passage are characterized by power spectra that are typical neither of z nor of atoll sources . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the coupling between the x - ray and the radio properties , focusing on three orbital phases when an enhancement of the radio flux density has been detected , to test the link between the inflow ( x - ray ) and the outflow ( radio jet ) to / from the compact object . in two out of three cases </S>",
    "<S> we associate the presence of the radio jet to a spectral transition in the x - rays , although the transition does not precede the radio flare , as detected in other z sources . </S>",
    "<S> an analogous behaviour has recently been found in the black hole candidate gx 339 - 4 . in the third case </S>",
    "<S> , the radio light curve shows a similar shape to the x - ray light curve . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss our results in the context of jet models , considering also black hole candidates .    </S>",
