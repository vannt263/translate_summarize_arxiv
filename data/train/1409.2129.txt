    "the growth of most modern economies is driven by consumer spending @xcite . therefore , consumer confidence levels can have significant effects on economic growth .",
    "consumer confidence indices ( cci ) are designed to measure the degree of confidence that consumers have with respect to the state of the economic system .",
    "the basis for many ccis lies in behavioral science where evidence has accumulated that individual consumer behavior is influenced by a number of emotional and social factors @xcite that interact with the consumer agents socio - economic context . in other words , the emotional state of consumers as well as",
    "their assessment of that of other consumers will shape their subsequent individual consumption patterns @xcite . in the aggregate ,",
    "as consumers collectively lose or gain confidence in the state of the economy , this is assumed to affect their collective consumption patterns and thus economic growth yielding a complex interaction between consumer confidence and economic conditions .",
    "this interplay between the complex behavior of individual agents and the emergent properties of their collective behavior is analogous to those seen in many other large - scale socio - technical systems @xcite .",
    "+ accurate , valid , and timely measures of consumer confidence are thus of pivotal importance to policy - makers and econometric forecasting . however , as a social and abstract construct `` consumer confidence '' is difficult to measure .",
    "researchers have turned to social science methods such as surveys and questionnaires which are expensive and time - consuming to conduct , and are possibly subject to a number of personal , cultural , and social biases , e.g.  social conformity bias @xcite which will confound measures of consumer confidence with cultural and linguistic propensities to divulge or withhold accurate information concerning one s level of confidence .",
    "the latter also renders comparisons of consumer confidence difficult to compares across different linguistic and cultural regions .",
    "+ here we investigate a computational approach that leverages large - scale search engine query volumes to gauge consumer confidence .",
    "we start from the assumption that search engine volumes reflects the issues that a population is contemporaneously pre - occupied with @xcite , congruent with recent work in the area of market modeling @xcite .",
    "hence , consumer confidence may be manifested in the volume of certain web searches such as `` taxes '' , `` investment '' , and `` stocks '' , but not others , e.g.  `` cloud '' and `` cat '' .",
    "we focus on china since it provides an interesting case for consumer confidence studies given its unique linguistic and cultural background , and the important role that the consumption patterns of its burgeoning middle - class are now playing in the global economy @xcite .",
    "+ we obtain google query volume time series for a number of chinese characters that are likely to express various facets of chinese consumer confidence given their use in existing surveys of consumer confidence in china . using a principal component analysis , we isolate the queries that are the main indicators of chinese consumer confidence @xcite , and define a chinese consumer confidence index ( c3i ) from a linear combination of the respective search volume data .",
    "we cross - validate the c3i against existing gauges of consumer confidence , demonstrating its ability to offer an accurate , timely , and informative view on consumer confidence in a region that has been historically underserved with regards to econometric indices .",
    "our results indicate that the c3i yields new information on the nature of chinese consumer confidence .",
    "our work may thus contribute to the science of modeling the social construct of consumer confidence and its socio - economic correlates that shape the emergent properties of economies as large - scale socio - technical systems @xcite .",
    "in our investigation we rely on the following data sources :    1 .   the chinese cci and ecq surveys of consumer confidence for the period under consideration . 2 .   google trend data for a specific number of search queries corresponding to the same time period .    given the different nature of these surveys we use the first as an official indicator of chinese consumer confidence and the latter to extract consumer confidence topics from which",
    "can be translated into google queries .",
    "consumer confidence in china is mainly gauged by 2 surveys : the consumer confidence index ( cci ) and the economist s confidence questionnaire ( ecq ) . + the chinese consumer confidence index ( cci )",
    "is reported by the national bureau of statistics of china ( nbsc ) on a monthly basis .",
    "its methodology consists of asking 3,500 individuals ( after november , 2009 ) about their confidence levels of the present and the future .",
    "it consists of a questionnaire of about 5 simple questions each pertaining to what is assumed to be a specific component of consumer confidence , e.g. `` how do you see your current employment conditions ? '' .",
    "subjects responses are recorded on a 5-point scale .",
    "we obtained historical monthly data of chinese cci from national bureau of statistics of china for the period of january 2006 to june 2013 , i.e.  90 months , as shown in fig .",
    "[ ccimonthly ] .",
    "it must be noted that the cci numbers reported by the nbsc may be affected by some considerations with respect to data normalization and adjustments @xcite .",
    "+    monthly time series of chinese cci ( published by the national bureau of statistics of china ) for the period of january 2006 to june 2013,width=604 ]      the cci is designed to be succinct and fast to administer .",
    "hence it consists of short questions designed to be answered in terms that are directly evaluative of the question , e.g. `` positive '' and `` negative '' with respect to that particular question , e.g.  `` how do you see your current employment conditions ? '' .",
    "however , we are looking to model the notion of chinese consumer confidence as exhaustively as possible so we can determine its correlates in online indicators .    the economist s confidence questionnaire ( ecq )",
    "contains 31 open questions such as `` what do you presently consider the greatest threat to the chinese economy ? '' , with a number of possible responses provided that can range from a few items to more than 15 . give the more open and exhaustive nature of the ecq we manually extract the core topics of the ecqs questions and answers , and corresponding chinese characters , to define an initial set of terms that can be reliably transformed to specific google search queries .",
    "the volume of the latter are then taken to indicate the level of online attention with respect to that particular topic .",
    "+ for example , ecq question 13 is \" how do you think the dollar value may change in the next 6 months ?  .",
    "we manually extract the chinese character for `` dollar trend '' , and add it to our initial set of topics that we deem to be indicative of consumer confidence .",
    "we then retrieve google trend data for each individual topic .",
    "as shown in table [ topics1 ] and [ ecqtopics ] ( appendix ) , we extracted a total of 44 topics from the ecq questions ranging from large macro - economic concepts such as `` inflation '' to more personal notions such as `` food price '' .",
    "however , only 34 topics could be retained for having sufficient google query volumes and were thus used as variables in our later analysis .",
    "the google trends ( www.google.com/trends/ ) service is offered by the google search engine ; it allows researchers to retrieve weekly / monthly normalized search volume data for any user - provided search query , provided the query has non - zero search volume .",
    "for example , a user can enter the query `` good '' and google trends will return a weekly time series whose values represent the volume of searches for that query recorded by google in that period of time on a weekly basis .",
    "an example of the google trends data for the chinese character `` hao '' ( en : `` good '' ) is shown in fig . [ googletrendshoa ] .",
    "google trends graph showing weekly fluctuations of search volume for `` hao '' ( en : `` good''),width=604 ]    as such we obtain google trends data for the 34 topics that produce non - zero search volumes from january 2006 to june 2013 thereby matching the date range of our cci data .",
    "since google trends data can be weekly and cci data is released monthly , we convert all weekly google trends time series to monthly time series by means of a 4-week moving average . since some months are longer than 4 weeks , where necessary , we move data points at the end of the month s last week to the next month .",
    "our research objectives are four - fold :    1 .",
    "we model chinese consumer confidence from the covariances between 34 ecq topic time series 2 .",
    "we define a chinese consumer confidence index ( c3i ) based on the principal components of ( 1 ) 3 .",
    "we compare our c3i to the cci using a stepwise regression model that fits the c3i components to the cci , including a determination of whether or not one indicator leads the other .",
    "we conduct a preliminary test of our model against a new google trends data set , that was not included in the original data that was used to construct our model ( july 2013 to may 2014 ) .    in fig .",
    "[ methodology ] we show an overview of our multi - phased methodology which is further explained in subsequent sections .     methodological overview : ( a ) we study the relationship between china s official cci data ( @xmath0 ) and google trends data ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "( b ) pca is used to determine the principal components of @xmath1 , followed by a granger test and var to determine the lead or lag relations between @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "( c ) @xmath2 denotes the inverse operation of pca to obtain the fitted values of our original model .",
    ", width=529 ]",
    "each of the 34 google trends time series ( corresponding to the ecq questionnaire topics ) can be taken as independent variables , representing a certain facet of consumer confidence . however , we need to determine the degree of multicollinearity to investigate whether each variable independently represents consumer confidence , and to ensure the validity of later regression models used to fit a potential c3i based on these 34 independent variables to the cci .",
    "+ therefore we perform a principal components analysis ( pca ) @xcite to study the components that underlie the covariances of our 34 google trends time series and reduct dimensionality .",
    "this will also ensure the orthogonality of our components and thus avoid the issue of multicollinearity in future regression models .",
    "+ we list the 10 highest ranked components with their loadings in table [ adfpars ] .",
