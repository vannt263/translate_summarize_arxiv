    "visual inspection of faint radio sources shows that many have optical counterparts which are preferentially located in pairs or small groups exhibiting disturbed optical morphologies , suggestive of interactions or mergers ( kron et al .",
    "1985 ; gruppioni et al .",
    "although this is not an ideal method for identifying physically associated groups , the frequency of cases suggests that such phenomena are at least partially responsible for the enhanced star formation rate seen in these objects ( kron et al .",
    "1985 ; windhorst et al .",
    "there is also independent evidence that tidal interactions affect both the nuclear galaxy activity and the disk star - formation rate .",
    "for example spectroscopic studies of interacting systems show significant excess of nuclear optical - line emission ( e.g. h@xmath1 ) compared to ` field ' galaxies ( keel et al .",
    "1985 ) , due to either nuclear star - formation or a non - thermal central source .",
    "a systematic enhancement is also seen in the disk h@xmath1 and far - infrared emission ( e.g. kennicutt et al .",
    "1987 ; bushouse et al .",
    "1988 ) , attributed to increased star - formation in the galactic disk .",
    "similarly , galaxy interactions are shown to enhance the radio emission from the nucleus of galaxies , which is mainly caused by star formation activity within the nuclear region ( e.g. hummel et al .",
    "recently , gallimore & keel ( 1993 ) demonstrated that about @xmath2 of infrared ( 60@xmath3 m ) selected galaxies are found in pairs showing an increase in their pairing fraction with increasing 60@xmath3 m luminosity .",
    "the pairing fraction of infrared selected galaxies is comparable to that derived for optically selected starbursts ( keel & van soest 1992 ) .",
    "moreover , a similar study of a redshift - limited sample of seyfert - type galaxies ( dahari 1984 ) has revealed an increased fraction of close companions ( @xmath4 ) compared to a control sample of ` field ' galaxies .",
    "galaxy interactions and mergers can be studied , in the absence of redshift information , using a statistical approach .",
    "this is to estimate the probability that galaxies , with angular separation @xmath5 , are physically associated , rather than randomly aligned on the sky plane .",
    "this technique has been applied to deep magnitude limited surveys , to study the evolution in the rate of galaxy mergers with redshift ( zepf & koo 1989 ; burkey et al .",
    "1994 ; roche et al . 1998 ) . in this paper",
    "we employ this method to estimate the pairing fraction of the sub - mjy sources detected in a deep and homogeneous radio survey ( phoenix ) with available multi - wavelength data .",
    "this technique has the advantage of being more quantitative and objective in identifying candidate interacting systems , compared to simple visual inspection .",
    "the latter method is sensitive to the depth of the survey , the wavelength of the observation and most crucially to the observer s criteria for identifying potentially interacting galaxies .",
    "the observations are described in section [ sec_2 ] .",
    "the statistical method for identifying candidate interacting galaxies is discussed in section [ sec_3 ] , while section [ sec_4 ] estimates the minimum angular separation for which close pairs can be resolved .",
    "the results are presented in section [ sec_5 ] and discussed in section [ sec_6 ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec_7 ] summarises our conclusions . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a value @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the radio observations were made at 1.4ghz using the 6a configuration of the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) .",
    "the mosaic of 30 pointing centres covers a @xmath8 diameter area centred at @xmath9 ; @xmath10 .",
    "the synthesised beam fwhm for each of the pointing centres is @xmath118arcsec .",
    "details of the observations , image formation , source extraction and catalogue generation are presented in hopkins et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . a source is included in the catalogue if its peak flux density is 4@xmath12 above the local rms noise .",
    "a total of 1079 sources with flux densities @xmath13mjy are detected .",
    "there are two kinds of incompleteness in the catalogue , as with any sample limited by peak flux density .",
    "the first is a loss of sensitivity due to the attenuation of the primary beam away from a pointing centre .",
    "this has been minimised in the phoenix survey by the mosaicing strategy used .",
    "the second is the fact that extended objects with a total flux density above the survey limit can be missed by an algorithm which initially detects candidates based on their peak flux density .",
    "methods of correcting these effects have been described by hopkins et al .",
    "the radio catalogue is found to be @xmath14 complete to 0.4mjy .",
    "the optical survey of the phoenix field was carried out at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) in the @xmath15-band .",
    "details about the observations and data reduction are presented in georgakakis et al .",
    "the source extraction and photometry is performed using the focas package ( jarvis & tyson 1981 ) .",
    "the star - galaxy separation is carried out to the limiting magnitude @xmath16mag . at fainter magnitudes",
    "no attempt is made to further eliminate stars form the sample , since compact galaxies could be mistakenly removed ( georgakakis et al .",
    "the resulting galaxy catalogue , complete to @xmath17mag , is used to optically identify the sources detected in the radio survey as described in georgakakis et al .",
    "a total of 504 radio sources ( @xmath18 ) have been identified to @xmath15=22.5mag .",
    "the spectroscopic data were obtained using slit spectroscopy at the eso 3.6 m telescope and multi - object fibre spectroscopy at the 2 degree field spectroscopic facility ( 2df ) at the aat .",
    "details about these observations are presented by georgakakis et al .",
    "redshifts were established for 228 out of 320 candidate optical identifications .",
    "the optical spectral features of these sources were employed to classify them as ( i ) absorption - line systems likely to be ellipticals ; ( ii ) star - forming galaxies ; ( iii ) seyfert 1 and 2 type galaxies ; and ( iv ) unclassified objects .",
    "the unclassified objects displayed at least one identified emission line ( allowing a redshift to be determined ) , but poor s / n , or a very small number of emission lines within the observable window , or the presence of instrumental features contaminating emission lines , prevented us from carrying out a reliable classification .",
    "to determine whether two galaxies are closely aligned on the sky by chance or are physically associated , we follow the method employed by burkey et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . given a random distribution of unrelated galaxies on the sky , the probability of a galaxy pair being chance projection is    @xmath19    where @xmath5 is the angular separation between the galaxies of the pair , with @xmath20 being the surface density of galaxies brighter than @xmath21 , the magnitude of the fainter of the two galaxies .",
    "the integrand is the probability of finding a galaxy in a ring of width @xmath22 , assuming poisson statistics ( scott & tout 1989 ) .",
    "equation ( [ eq_6.1 ] ) has a correction that accounts for the normal galaxy clustering , as estimated by the angular correlation function at relatively large angular separations .",
    "although this correction is not included in equation ( [ eq_6.1 ] ) , as will be discussed in section [ sec_5 ] , our analysis takes into account the clustering of optically selected galaxies .",
    "the surface density , @xmath20 , in equation ( [ eq_6.1 ] ) is calculated by integrating the counts to the limiting magnitude of the faintest member of the pair .",
    "this is a conservative approach since the contribution of pair members projected by chance is overestimated ( burkey et al .",
    "1994 ) . in equation ( [ eq_6.1 ] )",
    "we assume that the minimum angular separation , @xmath23 , over which individual galaxies can successfully be resolved , is zero .",
    "however , @xmath23 depends on both the atmospheric seeing conditions and the splitting efficiency of the source extraction software and is discussed in the next section",
    ". therefore equation ( [ eq_6.1 ] ) is corrected for the resolution effect as    @xmath24    to avoid biases due to incompleteness , we consider the optically identified radio sample with @xmath25mjy and @xmath26mag , comprising a total of 206 sources .",
    "regions contaminated by bright stars and vignetted corners are masked out .",
    "a probability cutoff @xmath27 , provides a sample of pairs that are least likely ( @xmath28 ) to be spurious alignments . to check the sensitivity of our results to the adopted probability cutoff",
    ", we also consider the @xmath29 case .",
    "the atmospheric seeing conditions at the time of the observation limit the minimum separation for which the independent components of galaxy pairs are successfully detected . for the present observations",
    "the average seeing is @xmath30arcsec .",
    "although focas can , in principle , split close pairs to the seeing limit , there is a trade - off between the focas resolving power and the number of spurious detections due to multiple splitting of extended sources .",
    "the focas splitting parameters are therefore , chosen to minimise this effect , albeit in the expense of resolving power . to quantify the focas splitting efficiency we use iraf software to construct artificial galaxy images separated by angular distances between 26arcsec and magnitudes in the range @xmath31mag .",
    "then , we attempt to recover the individual members of the pair using the focas package as with the real data - set .    the simulated galaxies are assigned an exponential intensity profile ( freeman 1970 ) similar to that of spiral galaxies and absolute magnitudes in the range m@xmath32=21.0 to 19.0mag , bracketing the characteristic luminosity ( m@xmath33mag ; metcalfe et al .",
    "1991 ) of the galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the peak surface density is @xmath34magarcsec@xmath35 , similar to that of high surface brightness galaxies ( freeman 1970 ) .",
    "the transformation from the @xmath36 filter to the @xmath15-band is performed using the @xmath37 colour at @xmath38 of a model spectral energy distribution corresponding to sab / sbc type galaxies ( pozzeti bruzual & zamorani 1996 ; georgakakis et al . 1999 ) .    for a given @xmath39 , galaxy pairs",
    "are generated with each of the galaxy components having magnitudes in the range @xmath31mag .",
    "poisson noise was added to the image , which is then convolved with a gaussian filter with fwhm of 1arcsec , simulating the effect of seeing .",
    "the simulations show a minimum resolving separation of @xmath40arcsec .",
    "this is demonstrated in figure [ fig_6.1 ] where the fraction of successfully split pairs is plotted against the separation of the components . for smaller separations focas",
    "is unable to split the individual galaxies , implying @xmath41arcsec in equation ( [ eq_6.2 ] ) .",
    "adopting @xmath42arcsec slightly decreases the estimated number of pairs with @xmath43arcsec , but does not alter any of our final conclusions .",
    "the technique outlined in section [ sec_3 ] is used to calculate the number of close pairs between radio sources and ` normal ' optically selected galaxies ( radio - galaxy/`field'-galaxy pairs ) .",
    "the distribution of radio - galaxy/`field'-galaxy pairs as a function of angular separation is shown by the hatched histogram in figure [ fig_6.3 ] for the probability cutoffs @xmath44 and 0.10 respectively . however",
    ", a fraction of the identified pairs are expected to be random superpositions on the sky plane . moreover , because of the normal clustering of galaxies , quantified by the two point correlation function , @xmath45 , we also expect a number of non - random galaxy pairs around optically identified radio sources . therefore , to investigate whether the pairing fraction of optically identified sub - mjy radio sources differs from that expected for",
    "` normal ' optically selected galaxies on average , we need to assess the significance of these two effects .",
    "for that purpose a total of 200 mock catalogues are constructed by randomly selecting galaxies in the range @xmath46mag from the optical galaxy catalogue .",
    "each of the mock catalogues has the same number of objects and the same magnitude distribution as the optically identified radio sample with @xmath25mjy and @xmath46mag .",
    "taking the galaxies of the mock catalogue in question as centres , the number of pairs with ` field ' galaxies is calculated , using the method outlined in section [ sec_3 ] .",
    "the mean number of close companions and the standard deviation at each angular separation is calculated from the 200 mock catalogues .",
    "the results are shown with the continuous line in figure 2 .",
    "the dashed lines represent the @xmath47 deviations around the mean . to improve the statistics we consider pairs in the range 412arcsec , where our estimator is more sensitive in identifying candidate interacting systems ( see section [ sec_6 ] ) . from the mock catalogues we count a total of 25.6@xmath485.0 pairs around ` normal '",
    "optically selected galaxies for angular separations @xmath49arcsec and for @xmath27 .",
    "this compares to @xmath50 ( poisson statistics ) pairs around radio sources .",
    "therefore , the number of pairs around faint radio sources above the random and @xmath45 expectation is @xmath51 ( 2.1@xmath12 confidence level ) . a similar result , with a slightly larger significance ( 2.3@xmath12 ) , is obtained for @xmath52 .",
    "the environment of faint radio sources has been explored in previous studies using visual inspection .",
    "kron et al . ( 1985 ) considered a radio selected sample with @xmath53mjy and available four - band photometry ( @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57-bands ) .",
    "for the sub - sample with @xmath46mag ( here we assume the transformation @xmath58 between @xmath56 and @xmath15-band magnitudes ; metcalfe et al .",
    "1991 ) they found that about @xmath59 of the sources ( 18 out of 95 ) lie in pairs or groups .",
    "more recently , gruppioni et al . ( 1999 ) studied a radio sample with @xmath60mjy and multi - wavelength photometric data .",
    "they conclude that about @xmath61 of the sources with @xmath62mjy and @xmath46mag ( 6 out of 22 galaxies in that study ) are found in pairs or small groups .",
    "the analysis described in the previous section identified 43 candidate interacting pairs out of a total of 206 sources , corresponding to a pairing fraction of @xmath63 , in reasonable agreement with the results from the above mentioned studies .",
    "we also find that although the pairing fraction of the sub - mjy sources in the present sample ( @xmath25mjy ; @xmath64mag ; @xmath43arcsec ) is higher than that of optically selected galaxies ( at the same magnitude limit ) , the significance of the excess is low ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "this implies that the pairing fraction of the sub - mjy population is higher than that of local galaxies .",
    "this is because the frequency of interactions in optically selected samples has been shown to increase with redshift ( burkey et al .",
    "therefore , the optically selected galaxy sample studied here , with a magnitude limit @xmath66mag , corresponding to a mean redshift @xmath67 ( pozzetti , bruzual & zamorani 1996 ) , already comprises a higher fraction of interacting systems than local galaxy samples .",
    "moreover , the similarity of the sub - mjy and ` field ' galaxy close pair distributions in figure [ fig_6.3 ] suggests that radio selection at a given optical magnitude limit does not guarantee a significantly higher fraction of interacting systems compared to optical selection ( at the same limiting magnitude ) .",
    "however , one should be cautious about this interpretation .",
    "firstly , the statistical approach used here calculates the probability of a galaxy having a physically associated companion with projected separation @xmath68 and magnitude @xmath15 by estimating the expected number of galaxies brighter than @xmath15 within radius @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , for a given magnitude , @xmath15 , the larger the separation , @xmath68 , the higher the probability , @xmath69 , that the pair is a spurious alignment of the sky plane .",
    "for example , for @xmath70mag only pairs with @xmath71arcsec are identified as potentially interacting for @xmath44 .",
    "consequently , the estimator in equation ( [ eq_6.2 ] ) is sensitive to relatively close pairs ( @xmath71arcsec ) and is likely to miss physically associated galaxies with larger projected separations .",
    "additionally , due to resolution effects we can only identify candidate interacting systems with @xmath72arcsec .",
    "this angular separation corresponds to a linear size of @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) at @xmath75 , the median redshift of the sub - sample with @xmath25mjy , @xmath26mag and available spectroscopic information ( 79 sources out of a total of 206 ) .",
    "these very close pairs are also expected to have high radio luminosity ( normalised to optical luminosity ; read & ponman 1998 ) .",
    "future high - resolution photometric observations have the potential to reveal the presence of very close pairs within the sub - mjy population , that remain unresolved in the present study .",
    "moreover , in our analysis we only consider the optically brightest ( @xmath76mag ) radio sources .",
    "these are likely to lie , on average , at relatively lower redshifts compared to optically fainter objects ( @xmath77mag ) .",
    "the pairing fraction of the optically fainter sub - mjy sources remains to be explored .",
    "a total of 27 out of 43 ( @xmath78 ) faint radio sources for which our analysis indicates possible association with ` field ' galaxies ( @xmath27 ) , have available spectroscopic information .",
    "the sample consists of absorption - line systems ( @xmath79 ) , seyfert 1 or 2 type objects ( @xmath80 ) , unclassified sources ( @xmath2 ) and star - forming galaxies ( @xmath59 ) . for @xmath52 ,",
    "the relative fraction of different types of sources is similar .",
    "the radio power distributions of these sources are compared in figure [ fig_6.4 ] with those of the spectroscopic sample of optically identified radio galaxies with @xmath25mjy and @xmath81mag .",
    "the histogram for the h@xmath1 luminosity distribution of the two samples is shown in figure [ fig_6.5 ] .",
    "there is no significant difference between the two populations in these figures .",
    "hummel ( 1981 ) also found no difference in the radio power distributions of isolated galaxies and galaxies in pairs .",
    "moreover , interacting systems , although being on average more luminous at infrared or h@xmath1 wavelengths compared to ` field ' galaxies , exhibit significant scatter around their mean emission properties ( keel et al .",
    "1985 ; kennicutt et al .",
    "1987 ; bushouse et al .",
    "this is attributed to ( i ) the relative velocities of the interacting galaxies ( ii ) the properties of the galactic disks , especially in relative weak encounters and ( iii ) the time scale of the induced star - formation relative to that of the gravitational encounter ( kennicutt et al .",
    "hence , a relatively small sample like the one considered here , can not reveal any correlations between pairing fraction and optical emission - line luminosity .",
    "moreover , close pairs with projected separations @xmath82arcsec remain unidentified in the present study .",
    "these pairs are also likely to be on average more luminous at optical and infrared wavelengths compared to systems with larger separations ( read & ponman 1998 ) .",
    "additionally , our analysis shows that galaxies with non - thermal nuclear activity are more frequently found in associations ( @xmath83 ) compared to radio sources heated by hot stars .",
    "this is because there is only a small number of star - forming galaxies ( @xmath84 of the spectroscopic sample ; georgakakis et al .",
    "1999 ) in the sub - sample with @xmath25mjy .",
    "this is dominated by absorption - line systems , seyfert 1 and 2s , constituting @xmath85 of the @xmath25mjy spectroscopic sample ( georgakakis et al .",
    "in this study an objective and quantifiable statistical approach is employed to assess the significance of tidal interactions in the evolution of the faint radio sources , detected in a deep and homogeneous radio survey with available photometric and spectroscopic data . in particular , the pairing fraction of the faint radio population is compared with that of optically selected ` field ' galaxies .",
    "we found evidence for an excess of close pairs around optically identified faint radio sources , albeit at a low significance level .",
    "this implies that ( i ) the frequency of interacting systems within the sub - mjy population is higher than that in local galaxy samples and ( ii ) the pairing properties of the sub - mjy radio sample ( with the given biases such as resolution effects ) are not significantly different from those of ` field ' galaxies at the same magnitude limit .",
