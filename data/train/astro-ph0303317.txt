    "a galactic microlensing event occurs when a compact massive object ( lens ) approaches very close to the observer s line of sight toward a background star ( source ) . due to lensing ,",
    "the source star image is split into two with different fluxes from that of the unlensed source .",
    "the locations and magnifications of the individual images are @xmath4 and @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the projected lens - source separation vector normalized by the einstein ring radius @xmath7 .",
    "the einstein ring represents the effective lensing region around the lens within which the combined source star flux is magnified greater than @xmath8 . for a typical galactic bulge event with a lens and a source located at @xmath9 kpc and @xmath10 , respectively ,",
    "the einstein ring has a radius of @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the lens mass .",
    "the angular size of @xmath7 corresponds to the physical distance at the lens location of @xmath13 for galactic events , the separation between the two images is @xmath14 , which is too small for the images to be resolved .",
    "however , the flux of the combined image varies with time due to the relative motion of the observer , lens , and source , and thus lensing events can be identified from the variation of source star fluxes .",
    "the light curve of a lensing event is represented by @xmath15 light variation caused by lensing can be distinguished from other types of variations due to the smooth , symmetric , and non - repeating characteristics of the lensing light curves .",
    "the duration of a lensing event is characterized by the einstein time scale @xmath16 , which represents the time required for the source to transit @xmath7 . for a typical lens - source proper motion of @xmath17",
    ", the einstein time scale has a value of @xmath18    if an event is caused by a lens having a planetary - mass companion and the position of the companion happens to be near the path of one of the two images created by the primary lens , the planet will perturb the light from the nearby image , causing deviation in the lensing light curve of the primary @xcite . for a planet with a mass ratio @xmath19 to the central star , the deviation lasts for a duration of @xmath20 , which corresponds to @xmath21 day for a jupiter - mass planet .",
    "due to the short duration , it is difficult to detect the planet - induced perturbations from the current survey - type experiments , which have typical monitoring frequencies of 12/night . to increase the monitoring frequency ,",
    "current experiments are employing early warning systems @xcite to issue alerts of ongoing events detected in the early stage of lensing magnification and follow - up observation programs @xcite to intensively monitor the alerted events .",
    "once the deviation is detected and analyzed , one can determine the mass ratio and the projected separation ( normalized by @xmath7 ) between the planet and central star , @xmath22 @xcite .    one important drawback of the current microlensing planet search strategy is that one can detect only planets located within a narrow region of separations from central stars .",
    "this is because the images produced by the central star are located close to the einstein ring during the event , and thus only planets located near the ring can effectively perturb the images ( see more details in   2 ) . as a result , even if a large sample of planets are detected and their separations are determined , no meaningful result can be drawn about the spatial distribution of planets around central stars .",
    "a second channel for the discovery of planets via microlensing is provided by planets in wider orbits .",
    "when the orbit of a planet is wide , two types of events are expected .",
    "one is `` repeating '' events in which the source trajectory passes close to both the planet and primary star and the other is `` isolated '' events in which the trajectory passes close to the planet only .",
    "planets via the channel of repeating events can be detected by the current - type follow - up observations [ see the extensive works of di stefano & scalzo ( 1999a,1999b ) on this channel of planet detections ] . detecting planets via the channel of isolated events , on the other hand , is difficult by the current experiments because these events occur without any warning and last for very short period of time .",
    "however , if the monitoring frequency is dramatically increased , it will be possible to detect a large sample of wide - orbit planets through this channel .",
    "recently , such a high - frequency survey experiment ( gest ) was proposed to nasa by @xcite .",
    "the gest mission is designed to continuously monitor @xmath23 galactic bulge main - sequence stars with a frequency of several times per hour by using a 12 m aperture space telescope .",
    "another population of planets that can be detected by the high - frequency lensing survey is free - floating planets .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the lensing properties of events caused by wide - orbit planets that will be detected by future high - frequency lensing experiments .",
    "unlike the negligible effect of the wide - orbit planet on the lensing behavior of the primary , the effect of the primary on the lensing behavior of the planet may be important even at very large separations due to the large primary / planet mass ratio .",
    "if this is so , the signature of the central stars might be noticed for a significant fraction of events , enabling one to distinguish them from events caused by free - floating planets .",
    "the paper is composed as follows . in   2 ,",
    "we discuss the basics of planetary microlensing that are required to describe the lensing behavior of events caused by wide - orbit planets . in   3 , we investigate the properties of wide - orbit planetary lensing in detail . in   4 , we estimate the probability of distinguishing events produced by wide - orbit planets from those caused by free - floating planets . in   5 , we summarize the results and discuss the implications of the results .",
    "the lensing behavior of a system having a planetary - mass companion is described by the formalism of binary lensing with a very low mass - ratio companion .",
    "if a source star located at @xmath24 in complex notations is lensed by two point - mass lenses with the individual locations of @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the mass fractions of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , the locations of the resulting images @xmath29 are obtained by solving the lens equation , which is represented by @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath32 and all lengths are normalized by the einstein ring radius corresponding to the total mass of the binary ( combined einstein ring radius @xmath7 ) . since the lens equation describes a mapping from the lens plane to the source plane , finding image positions ( @xmath33 ) for a given source position ( @xmath34 ) requires inverting the lens equation .",
    "although the lens equation for a binary lens system can not be algebraically inverted due to its nonlinearity , it can be expressed as a fifth - order polynomial in @xmath32 and the image positions can be obtained by numerically solving the polynomial @xcite . since the lensing process conserves the source star surface brightness , the magnification of each image equals to the area ratio between the image and the unlensed source and mathematically it is obtained by computing the jacobian of the mapping equation evaluated at the image position ; @xmath35 then , the total magnification is given by the sum of the magnifications of the individual images , i.e.  @xmath36 .    due to the very small mass ratio of the planet to the primary ,",
    "the planetary lensing behavior is well described by that of a single lens event for most of the event duration . however , noticeable deviations can occur if the planet is located close to one of the images produced by the primary lens .",
    "the region around the image - perturbing planet s location in the lens plane corresponds to the region around caustics in the source plane .",
    "therefore , for the source - plane point of view , noticeable deviations occur when the source approaches the region around caustics .",
    "the caustics are the main new features of binary lensing and refer to the set of source positions at which the magnification of a point source becomes infinity . for the case of a wide - orbit planet ,",
    "the caustic is located along the primary - planet axis and its location on the axis is approximated by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the position of the planet ( in units of @xmath7 ) with respect to the primary which is located at the origin @xcite .",
    "then , caustics are located within the einstein ring when the planetary separation is in the range of @xmath39 , which is so called the ` lensing zone ' @xcite . in addition , the size of the caustic , and thus the probability of detecting planet - induced deviations , is maximized when the planet is in the lensing zone . under the current planet - search strategy of monitoring events caused by stellar - mass lenses ,",
    "therefore , only planets within the lensing zone can be effectively detected .",
    "as the separation between the planet and central star increases , the caustic shrinks rapidly . if the separation is significantly larger than the einstein ring radius , both lens components behave as if they are two independent single lenses . due to the deflection of light produced by the presence of the companion , however , the position of each lens is effectively shifted towards the companion @xcite .",
    "the effective positions of the individual lenses are given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 represents the einstein ring radius of each lens , the subscripts ` @xmath42 ' and ` @xmath43 ' are used to denote one lens component and its companion , respectively , and the term @xmath44 implies that the shift is towards the direction of the companion . then , the amount of the positional shift of the central star due to the planet is @xmath45 , which is negligible due to the combination of small @xmath19 and large @xmath22 . on the other hand , the amount of the shift of the planet s position due to its central star , @xmath46 , is not negligible because it does not depend on @xmath19 .",
    "note that the effective position of the wide - orbit planet is @xmath47 implying that it corresponds to the position of the caustic [ cf .",
    "since significant deviations can occur only if the source trajectory passes close to caustics , although most part of the light curve of the event caused by a wide - orbit planet is approximated by that of a single - lens event produced by the planet at its effective position , its central part can be distorted due to the effect of the central star .",
    "another thing to be taken into consideration in describing the lensing behavior of events caused by wide - orbit planets is the effect of extended source size .",
    "the finite - source effect for these events is important because the einstein ring radius of the planet , @xmath48 , is very small , and thus the lensed star can no longer be approximated by a point source @xcite .",
    "for events caused a jupiter - mass planet , for example , the radii of source stars correspond to @xmath49 , 10% , and 43% of @xmath50 for events involved with main - sequence ( @xmath51 ) , turn - off ( @xmath52 ) , and clump giant ( @xmath53 ) source stars , respectively . the lensing magnification affected by the finite - source effect is given by the intensity - weighted magnification averaged over the source flux , i.e.@xmath54 where @xmath55 is the vector notation of the center of the source , @xmath56 is the displacement vector of a point on the source star surface with respect to the source star s center , and the notation @xmath57 represents the surface integral over the source star surface . under the assumption that the source has a uniform surface brightness profile , the computation of the magnification can be reduced from a two - dimensional to a one - dimensional integral by using green s theorem @xcite .    to investigate the lensing properties of events caused by wide - orbit planets in more detail , we construct maps of fractional magnification excesses .",
    "the magnification excess is defined by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the exact magnification of the wide - orbit planet and @xmath60 is the magnification of the single lens approximation , i.e.  that of a free - floating planet .",
    "the map provides an overview of the anomaly patterns , not testing all light curves resulting from a large number of source trajectories .    in figure 1",
    ", we present the constructed excess maps of three example lens systems having planets with different separations from the central star of @xmath61 , 7 , and 9 , respectively . for the lens ,",
    "we assume the einstein ring radius is @xmath62 au by adopting that of a typical galactic bulge event , and thus the separations correspond to the physical distances of @xmath63 au , 14 au , and 18 au , respectively .",
    "the mass ratio of the tested planet to that of the primary is @xmath64 , which corresponds to that of a jupiter - mass planet around a low - mass main - sequence star with a mass of @xmath65 .",
    "since the most common stars to be monitored by the gest mission will be main - sequence stars , the maps are constructed assuming that the source star has a radius of @xmath66 .",
    "each map is centered at the effective position of the planet ( marked by ` + ' ) and the true position of the planet is marked by a filled dot .",
    "all lengths are normalized by @xmath50 . from the maps ,",
    "one finds that , as expected , the effective planet position matches very well the center of the caustic induced by the central star .",
    "one also finds that the size of significant deviation regions ( compared to the size of the einstein ring of the planet ) is not negligible even for planets located at large separations . in figure 2",
    ", we present several example light curves of events resulting from the source trajectories marked in fig .  1 .    to see the variation of anomaly pattern depending on the planet s mass ratio",
    ", we also construct maps of planets with different mass ratios and present them in figure 3 . for these maps ,",
    "the planet - primary separation is fixed as @xmath67 ( @xmath68 au ) .",
    "the tested planets have mass ratios of @xmath64 , 0.001 , and 0.0001 , which correspond to a jupiter- , saturn- , and @xmath69-mass planet around a @xmath65 star , respectively .",
    "the dot on the upper right corner of each left panel represents source size relative to the einstein ring of the planet .",
    "we note that since all lengths are scaled by @xmath50 , which is proportional to @xmath70 , the source size appears to be different although the actual size is the same . from the maps",
    ", we find that finite - source effect does not seriously affect the anomaly patterns of events caused by giant planets with @xmath71 . for planets in this mass regime ,",
    "the maps have similar patterns because both the size of the caustic and the planet s einstein ring radius have the same dependency on the mass ratio , i.e.   @xmath72 , and thus they decrease by the same scale as @xmath19 decreases .",
    "this can be seen from the similarity between the maps of jupiter- and saturn - mass planets .",
    "as the mass ratio further decreases , however , the finite - source effect becomes important .",
    "we find that for the case of planets with @xmath73 , the source size becomes bigger than the size of the caustic even for main - sequence source stars and the signatures of the central star is seriously washed out by the finite - source effect .",
    "by using the excess map , we then estimate the probability of distinguishing events caused by wide - orbit planets from those produced by free - floating planets . for this estimation , we assume that events with @xmath74 are continuously monitored with a frequency of 3 times per hours . here",
    "@xmath75 is the threshold magnification , which is required for event identification . for each planet separation , we produce 900 light curves resulting from source trajectories with orientations relative to the planet - primary axis and impact parameters to the planet , which are randomly selected in the range of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively . here",
    "the quantity @xmath78 represents the impact parameters of the source trajectory to the planet normalized by @xmath50 and @xmath79 is the impact parameter corresponding to @xmath75 . with the excess map ,",
    "the light curves are produced by the one - dimensional cut through the map .",
    "since the map is constructed by considering the finite - source effect , the light curves produced in this way automatically incorporate the effect . to be identified as a bound planet",
    ", it is assumed that the light curve should have at least one data point with deviations greater than a threshold value of @xmath80 .",
    "we note that the photometric precision of the gest mission will be @xmath81 even for main - sequence source stars , and thus the adopted detection threshold is very conservative choice . with this detection criteria ,",
    "the probability is determined as the ratio of the number of events with noticeable deviations out of the total number of tested events .    in figure 3 , we present the resulting probabilities as a function of planetary separation for planets with different mass ratios , which are distinguished by different line colors",
    ". the sets of curves with different line types are the probabilities for different threshold magnifications . when the threshold is fixed , the probability becomes smaller as @xmath19 decreases due to the combination of shorter duration of perturbations and larger effect of extended sources . for a given planet ,",
    "the probability increases as the threshold magnification increases .",
    "this is because the deviation region is confined to the central region around the effective planet position and thus the chances to detect deviations are greater for higher magnification events . from the figure",
    ", we find that the signatures of central stars can be detected with significant probabilities ( @xmath82 ) for planets with separations @xmath83 au , which roughly corresponds to the distance of the saturn from the sun .",
    "although the probability drops rapidly for planets with @xmath73 , the probability is still substantial for giant planets with separations up to @xmath3 au , corresponding to the separation between the uranus and the sun .",
    "under the current microlensing planet search strategy of monitoring events caused by stellar - mass lenses , only planets located within a narrow region of separations from central stars can be effectively detected .",
    "however , with the dramatic increase of the monitoring frequency , two additional populations of free - floating and wide - orbit planets can be detected .",
    "we investigated the lensing properties of events caused by wide - orbit planets and found that a significant fraction of these events could be distinguished from those caused by free - floating planets .",
    "we determined that even with moderate detection criteria the probability to detect signatures of central stars for events caused by wide - orbit planets would be @xmath1 for giant planets with separations @xmath2 au and the probability is still substantial for planets with separations up to @xmath3 au .",
    "detecting a large sample of these events will be important because they can provide useful information about the spatial distribution of extrasolar planets , which can not be obtained by the sample to be acquired under the current microlensing planet search strategy or from other planet search methods such as the radial velocity and transit methods .",
    "in addition , proper estimation of the probability of distinguishing events caused by the two populations of planets will be important for the correct determination of the frequency of free - floating planets , whose microlensing sample will be contaminated by wide - orbits planets .",
    "we would like to thank j.  h.  an for kindly providing his code designed for efficient computation of lensing magnifications of events affected by finite - source effect .",
    "this work was supported by the astrophysical research center for the structure and evolution of the cosmos ( arcsec ) of korea science & engineering foundation ( kosef ) through science research program ( src ) program ."
