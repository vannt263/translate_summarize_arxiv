    "in the last ten years the interaction of @xmath0-mesons with few - nucleon systems has attracted considerable interest , and quite a large amount of research has been carried out both on the experimental as well as on the theoretical side .",
    "the major aim of this activity is to obtain a well - defined conceptual picture of the low - energy @xmath0-nuclear interaction which then may serve to clarify the foundation of the more fundamental @xmath4 problem .    of special interest is the @xmath0-@xmath1-system , for which exactly soluble models are available . at the same time it encloses a much wider range of phenomena than the more simple @xmath5 case . in this context",
    "we would also like to mention several precise experimental investigations of @xmath0-production on three - body nuclei performed during the last decade @xcite .",
    "previous theoretical studies in this area were restricted to various approximations in treating the few - particle aspects of this problem . as an earlier nonperturbative calculation",
    ", we would like to refer to the optical model approach of  @xcite , whose purpose was to estimate qualitatively the possible formation of bound @xmath0-meson states with the lightest nuclei .",
    "more refined calculations were presented in  @xcite , where the authors were able to sum the multiple scattering series for the @xmath0-@xmath3h amplitude , including several important corrections to the trivial optical limit . another result reported in  @xcite",
    "were obtained within the so - called finite - rank - approximation ( fra ) which has recently been applied also to the @xmath0-production from three - body nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the crucial point of this model is the neglect of target excitations during the interaction with the @xmath0-meson .",
    "clearly this assumption allows one to avoid the complications associated with the direct solution of the four - body dynamical equations .",
    "concerning the present study , we were guided by the idea that the approximations used in many - body physics , such as the optical model or adiabatic treatment of the target , may fail when few - particle systems are studied . especially , this seems to be true for small kinetic energies , where the unitarity conditions of the scattering matrix , nucleon recoil and other effects become significant .",
    "their neglect , tolerated in various many - body approaches , may affect drastically the quality of the few - body results .",
    "therefore , the present work is intended to solve the @xmath0-@xmath1-problem without making any such not well controlled approximations .",
    "the basis of our calculation is the four - body formalism in momentum space .",
    "although a variety of methods for solving the n - particle problem has been proposed in the literature , the faddeev - yakubovsky theory  @xcite and the one of alt , grassberger and sandhas ( ags )  @xcite are most convenient and preferred for practical applications . adopting the separable representation for the driving two - body potentials as well as for the subamplitudes appearing in the ( 1 + 3)- and ( 2 + 2)-partitions of the four - body system , both approaches lead to the same set of effective two - body equations  @xcite . as is well known , the separable approximation of the integral kernels permits one to represent the dynamical equations in terms of particle exchange diagrams . due to this tractability and its relatively simple numerical realization ,",
    "this method has received wide acceptance in few - body physics .",
    "thus at present , a feasible formalism of four - particle theory has been extensively developed , despite the much more complex structure of the corresponding equations compared to the three - body case .",
    "after the work of tjon  @xcite impressive results have been obtained in recent years for the four - nucleon low - energy interaction ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) , as well as for pion absorption on three - nucleon systems  @xcite . with respect to other techniques we would like to refer to recent work in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we outline briefly the formal aspects concerning the application of the four - body formalism to the @xmath0-@xmath1 system within the quasiparticle approach . besides the basic equations we introduce here the two- and three - body ingredients of the model .",
    "our results for @xmath0-@xmath3h elastic scattering are presented in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] , and conclusions are drawn in the last section .",
    "details are given in two appendices .",
    "the separable method is well known to allow one to reduce the @xmath6-body problem to an in general simpler @xmath7-body case , where one of the constituents appears as a quasiparticle , i.e. , a two - body bound , virtual or resonance state . in particular , the three - body equations for the ( 3@xmath83 ) transition amplitudes are exactly reduced to effective two - particle equations of lippmann - schwinger type .",
    "their kernels contain the off - energy - shell ( 2@xmath82 ) amplitudes for all two - body subsystems . in an analogous manner",
    ", the four - body scattering kernels can be expressed in terms of subamplitudes stemming from the decomposition of the four - body system into the partitions ( 1 + 3 ) and ( 2 + 2 ) .",
    "therefore , approximating these subamplitudes once more by a separable ansatz we can again reduce the four - body problem to an effective quasiparticle two - body one . the formal details of this two - step reduction scheme may be found in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to a brief description of the resulting quasi - two - body equations as applied to the @xmath0-@xmath1 system .      since our formalism does not include coulomb forces",
    ", we will consider for definiteness the @xmath0-@xmath3h interaction throughout this paper .",
    "all appropriate states are assumed to be properly antisymmetrized with respect to the nucleons .",
    "the corresponding antisymmetrization procedure is outlined in appendix a. then we are led to the following three channels , corresponding to three possible two - quasiparticle partitions of the @xmath0-@xmath1 system @xmath9 we only need the amplitudes connecting the initial asymptotic state , consisting of the @xmath1 bound state ( @xmath3h ) and a free @xmath0-meson , with all three channels listed in ( [ eq145 ] ) .",
    "they obey a set of three coupled integral equations ( see appendix a ) , whose structure is represented by the following matrix equation @xmath10 here the index @xmath11=1,2,3 stands for the channel @xmath12 from ( [ eq145 ] ) .",
    "the amplitude @xmath13 describes the transition @xmath14 .",
    "the effective potentials the suggestive term `` potential '' . ]",
    "@xmath15 are expressed in terms of the form factors , generated by the separable representation of the subamplitudes appearing in the channels ( [ eq145 ] ) .    because here we consider only low energy scattering , we take into account only the dominant @xmath2-wave part of the interaction in the two - body subsystems and thus only @xmath2-waves in the three- and four - particle states .",
    "therefore , the matrix elements are diagonal with respect to the total spin @xmath16 . for the elastic @xmath0-@xmath3h scattering",
    "we need to consider only those states where the spins and isospins of all nucleons are coupled to @xmath17 . in all expressions to follow we drop the index @xmath18 .",
    "the explicit analytical form of the potentials @xmath15 , taking into account the spin - isospin degrees of freedom , is given in the appendix b. in a more detailed notation the system ( [ eq150 ] ) reads @xmath19 the index @xmath20 in the above equations corresponds to the total spin of the given @xmath21 pair .",
    "clearly , due to the pseudoscalar - isoscalar nature of the @xmath0-meson , the value of @xmath2 fixes uniquely the spin structure of the overall 4-body state with total spin @xmath16=1/2 . in view of the limitation of the two - body interaction to the dominant @xmath2-wave part",
    ", the isospin @xmath22 of a @xmath21 pair is fixed by its spin @xmath2 through the condition @xmath23 .",
    "the subenergies @xmath24 in ( [ eq155 ] ) are defined as @xmath25 with reduced masses @xmath26 a graphical representation of the system ( [ eq155 ] ) is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the structure of ( [ eq150 ] ) allows one to eliminate the channel ( 1 ) yielding an equivalent set of only two coupled equations for the amplitudes @xmath27 and @xmath28 . in detail",
    ", one has for @xmath29 @xmath30 where the new effective potentials are given by ( @xmath31 ) @xmath32 after solving the system ( [ eq175 ] ) , the amplitude @xmath33 is obtained from @xmath34 the set of equations ( [ eq175 ] ) is more suitable for the numerical solution than ( [ eq155 ] ) , since in the former case the integration over the triton pole in the propagator @xmath35 may be carried out independently from the procedure of solving the system ( [ eq175 ] ) itself .",
    "thus the kernels in ( [ eq175 ] ) are smooth functions of the integration variable , and the equations may be solved by direct matrix inversion .",
    "we recall that below the triton break - up threshold we are dealing with only nonsingular potentials @xmath15 .",
    "the key ingredient of the quasiparticle method @xcite , leading to the equations of the type ( [ eq155 ] ) , is the separable representation of the off - shell scattering amplitudes for the two- and three - body subsystems , appearing in the ( 2 + 2)- and ( 1 + 3)-partitions . in our case ,",
    "the two types of two - body subsystems involved are @xmath21 and @xmath4 , denoted in the following by `` @xmath36 '' and `` @xmath37 '' , respectively . for the corresponding scattering matrices we adopt the simplest rank - one separable form . in detail",

    "those for the @xmath21 interaction were taken from the low - energy @xmath21 fit presented in @xcite , and the @xmath49-parameters are chosen as to reproduce the scattering length @xmath50  fm which agrees with the most recent results  @xcite .",
    "however , our parameterization gives a different value for the effective range parameter @xmath51  fm compared to @xmath52  fm of  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we are not able to fit both values @xmath53 and @xmath54 simultaneously , which is of course the price one has to pay for using the simplest separable ansatz ( [ eq10 ] ) . when comparing our predictions with those of  @xcite we use also other sets of @xmath4-parameters chosen in such a way that they lead in each case to the corresponding value of @xmath53 used there ( see table  [ tab3 ] ) .",
    "turning now to the general scheme , we have to introduce also the separable representation for the three - body subamplitudes , which will then serve as a necessary input for the four - body calculation . for this purpose",
    "we apply the hilbert - schmidt expansion .",
    "the main formal aspects of the procedure can be found e.g.  in @xcite .",

    "their inclusion would imply an increase in the number of channels in the final equations as well as adoption of relativistic kinematics which would lead to much more complex formalism . on the other hand due to its small mass ,",
    "the pion is expected to give only minor corrections to low - energy @xmath0-nucleus scattering @xcite .",
    "apart from the genuine three particle scattering amplitudes , we also need as input the effective amplitudes , denoted here by @xmath86 , which describe two independent pairs of interacting particles in the channel ( 3 ) .",

    ". then the separable form of the transition matrices is generated by the hilbert - schmidt expansion @xmath94 in the spirit of the terminology , adopted for the separable approach , we may interpret the function @xmath95 as the form factor of the two - particle `` bound state '' @xmath96 when the other two particles are in the `` bound state '' @xmath97 .    in figs.[fig3 ] through [ fig5 ] we present the leading eigenvalues @xmath98 and the real parts of @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",

    ". therefore we shall restrict our consideration to the region below the triton break - up threshold .",
    "\\2 ) the eigenvalue @xmath105 goes through unity at the energy @xmath106 mev , which is essentially lower than the experimental value of the triton binding energy @xmath107  mev .",
    "this disagreement is a consequence of using the extremely simple yamaguchi @xmath21 scattering matrix ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "although this ansatz fits low - energy @xmath21 scattering , it has too long a tail into the high - momentum region and , therefore , predicts too much binding for the three - nucleon system .",
    "\\3 ) the modulus of the eigenvalues @xmath108 and @xmath109 are close to each other .",
    "therefore , one can expect , that the leading terms in the expansion ( [ eq95 ] ) will cancel each other to a large extent , which may lead to a relatively slow convergence rate of the sum . in order to demonstrate",
    "how well a finite sum ( [ eq95 ] ) may represent the exact amplitude , we show in fig .",

    "as already mentioned , we compare in table  [ tab3 ] our predictions on the @xmath0-@xmath3h scattering length with those of  @xcite using an @xmath4-interaction which reproduces the @xmath53 scattering length of  @xcite .",
    "one must note a rather strong difference of the results , especially for the real part of @xmath141 .",
    "apparently , the latter must be very sensitive to the position of the pole in the amplitude as it lies close to zero energy .",
    "very rough agreement may be noticed with  @xcite .",
    "but there is a tendency of our prediction to give a larger value of @xmath149 , which is probably due to the difference in the @xmath4 range parameter @xmath54 noted in the beginning of sect .",
    "[ sect2b ] .    as to the question about the existence of a quasibound state , which an @xmath0-meson can form with the lightest nuclei @xcite , we see that within our model the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction is not strong enough in order to bind the @xmath0-@xmath3h system .",
    "this conclusion does not support the results of the fra - model  @xcite or those of the optical model  @xcite where an @xmath0-@xmath1 bound state appears already for rather modest values of the @xmath4 scattering length .",
    "it should also be remembered that our calculations are based on the rank - one separable @xmath21 potential which is known to overestimate the attraction in the three - nucleon system .",
    "therefore , we expect that the use of more refined @xmath21 models will most likely reduce the probability for binding the @xmath0-@xmath3h - system .",
    "in the present paper , the four - body scattering formalism has been applied to study the @xmath0-@xmath1 interaction in the energy region very close to the @xmath0-@xmath3h elastic scattering threshold . the calculational scheme , which formally allows an exact solution , is based on the separable approximation of the appropriate integral kernels .",
    "the validity of this approach is justified by the fact that the driving @xmath21 and @xmath4 interactions are governed mainly by the @xmath16-matrix poles , lying in each case near the low - energy region .",
    "therefore , the separable potentials , giving the correct structure of the amplitude close to the poles , are expected to provide an adequate approximation . in the present paper",
    "we have realized one of the possible schemes for solving the @xmath0-@xmath1 four - body problem . to test its applicability ,",
    "we have investigated the hilbert - schmidt procedure for constructing a separable representation of finite rank of the four - body kernels .",
    "the examination of their schmidt norms shows that the rate of convergence by increasing the rank is not very fast , but satisfactory for practical purposes . keeping 6 to 8 terms in the separable expansion ,",
    "we have obtained a rather good precision .",
    "the same conclusion is valid for the calculation of the @xmath0-@xmath3h scattering length . at the same time we would like to point out that the present calculation suffers from the oversimplification of the @xmath21 interaction , for which the rank - one yamaguchi potential has been used .",
    "of course , this shortcoming can be cured by using a more sophisticated separable approximation for the @xmath21 scattering matrix , requiring only more computational efforts .",
