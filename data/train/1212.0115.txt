    "recently many authors have studied what we call  hyperbolic type metrics  of a domain @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "the term  hyperbolic type metric  is for us just a descriptive term , we do not define it .",
    "the term is justified by the fact that the metric is similar to the hyperbolic metric of the unit ball @xmath4 in this paper we will study a hyperbolic type metric @xmath5 with the following two properties :    1 .   if @xmath2 is a subdomain , then @xmath6 for all @xmath7,[subdomain condition ] 2 .",
    "sensitivity to the boundary variation : if @xmath8 and @xmath9 , then the metrics @xmath5 and @xmath10 are quite different close to @xmath11 whereas `` far away '' from @xmath11 we might expect that they are nearly equal ( see remark [ rem - intro-1 ] ) .    in particular , we require that @xmath5 is defined for every proper subdomain of @xmath12 the purpose of this paper is to study the subdomain monotonicity property and to prove conditions under which we have a quantitative refinement of .    for a subdomain @xmath13 and @xmath14 the _ distance ratio metric @xmath15 _ is defined by @xmath16 where @xmath17 denotes the euclidean distance from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "sometimes we abbreviate @xmath20 by writing just @xmath21 the above form of the @xmath15 metric , introduced in @xcite , is obtained by a slight modification of a metric that was studied in @xcite .",
    "quasihyperbolic metric _ of @xmath1 is defined by the quasihyperbolic length minimizing property @xmath22 where @xmath23 represents the family of all rectifiable paths joining @xmath18 and @xmath24 in @xmath1 , and @xmath25 is the quasihyperbolic length of @xmath26 ( cf .",

    "our main work is to refine some inequalities between @xmath33 metric , @xmath15 metric and the euclidean metric .",
    "both the distance ratio and the quasihyperbolic metric qualify as hyperbolic type metrics because    * both are defined for every proper subdomain of @xmath34 * for the case of the unit ball @xmath35 both are comparable to the hyperbolic metric of @xmath36 see section [ sec-2 ] below , * it is well - known that both metrics satisfy the above properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",

    "the following proposition , which will be used in the proof of theorems [ newlem ] , gathers together several basic well - known properties of the metrics @xmath33 and @xmath15 , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the motivation comes from the well - known inequality @xmath53 for a domain @xmath54 where @xmath55 one can ask : when do both the metrics @xmath15 and @xmath33 ( or @xmath56 ) coincide ?      1 .",
