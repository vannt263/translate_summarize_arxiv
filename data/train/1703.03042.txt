    "in this section we recall one such a solution described in @xcite ; one may use this toy model as a rough picture to understand the elements that compose an actual fuzzball solution .",
    "we first mention the problem that fuzzballs solve , and then give the model for the fuzzball .",
    "a key aspect of the information paradox is the argument that ` black holes have no hair ' .",

    "this is an illustration of the classical ` no hair ' theorem , but it is crucial that the same computation leads gives ` no hair ' at the _ quantum _ level . to see this",
    ", we first recall a situation where we _ can _ add hair to deform the solution . consider a static star given by the metric ds^2=-f(r ) dt^2 + dr^2 g(r)+r^2d_2 ^ 2 [ qone ] let the lowest energy state for the quantum field @xmath33 in this vacuum be @xmath34 .",
    "we can again solve the wave equation @xmath29 in the metric ( [ qone ] ) = _ klm(r ) y_lm ( , ) e^-i_kl t_klm this time there will be a complete set of solutions of this form .",
    "we can therefore write = _ klm ( _ klm a_klm + ^*_klm a^_klm ) then the states of the system are given by exciting the vacuum @xmath34 a^_k_1l_1m_1 ",
    "a^_k_n l_n m_n |0_star [ qtfive ] these excitations add ` scalar hair ' to the star .",
    "by contrast , for the black hole metric ( [ qtwo ] ) we do not find regular solutions @xmath35 , and so we can not change the quantum state in this way .",
    "the quantum vacuum state around the horizon is therefore unique , and it is this state that leads to the creation of hawking s entangled pairs .",
    "we have looked at a simple example above , but years of effort with different models did not shake this basic conclusion that the horizon can not be deformed , either at the classical or quantum level .",
    "one may try to avoid the problem by not allowing a horizon in the first place , but here we run into results like buchdahl s theorem @xcite . consider a star made of a perfect fluid , whose density @xmath36 increases monotonically inwards .",
    "if the radius @xmath37 of the fluid ball satisfies r<9m4 [ qthree ] then the pressure will diverge at some radius @xmath38 , rendering the solution invalid .",
    "thus any fluid ball that has been compressed to a size smaller than ( [ qthree ] ) must necessarily collapse and generate a horizon .",
    "string theory avoids these problems in a remarkable way , through the _ fuzzball mechanism_. a toy model for the fuzzball was discussed in @xcite .",
    "consider the 4 + 1 dimensional spacetime obtained by adding a trivial time direction to the 3 + 1 dimensional euclidean schwarzschild solution ds^2=-dt^2 + ( 1-r_0r)d^2 + dr^21-r_0r + r^2 ( d^2+^2d^2 ) [ metrickk ] this metric is a perfectly regular solution of the 4 + 1 vacuum einstein equations .",

    "the @xmath41 directions form a cigar , whose tip lies at @xmath42 .",

    "this scalar field has a standard stress tensor , whose value works out to be t^ _ = diag \\{- , p_r , p _ , p_}=diag \\{-f , f , -f , -f } where f= 3r_0 ^ 28r^4 ( 1-r_0r)^32 we see that the pressures do diverge at @xmath45 , and if we followed the spirit of buchdahl s theorem , we would discard this solution .",
    "but the solution is actually a perfectly regular solution in 4 + 1 dimensions ; what breaks down is the dimensional reduction map when the length of the compact circle goes to zero .",
    "the fuzzball solutions are similar in spirit : they are valid solutions in the full 10-dimensional string theory , but are singular when viewed from the perspective of the noncompact directions alone .",
    "the simplest fuzzball solutions are characterized by a set of kk monopoles and antimonopoles , which are regular solutions of gravity but with a singular dimensional reduction . in the limit",
    "where the center if a kk monopole coincides with the center of an anti - monopole , it is known that the bosonic fields yield the euclidean schwarzschild solution tensored trivially with time and the other compact directions , similar in spirit to ( [ metrickk ] ) @xcite .",
    "this solution is unstable , but that is as it should be : microstates of the nonextremal hole should radiate radiate energy , and in specific cases the instability of the microstate solutions has been shown to map exactly to the hawking radiation expected from that microstate @xcite .",
    "thus we can use the solution ( [ metrickk ] ) as our toy model of a fuzzball to illustrate the picture of the gravitational vacuum that we wish to present .    before proceeding",
    ", we note that similar features are obtained for the ` bubble of nothing ' which was discovered an an instability of the vacuum for the spacetime @xmath46 @xcite . in this solution",
    "a bubble nucleates by a vacuum fluctuations that pinches off the compact circle .",
    "after the bubble tunnels to a certain size , it can continue to expand further as an on - shell classical solution .",
    "topologically the metric is similar to the euclidean schwarzschild solution .",
    "again we can dimensionally reduce on the @xmath47 , getting a scalar @xmath48 on 3 + 1 dimensional spacetime .",
    "the stress tensor of @xmath48 diverges as we approach the bubble wall , though the overall spacetime is smooth @xcite . in our qualitative analysis below we will use the euclidean schwarzschild solution as our toy model of the fuzzball , and we will assume ( by analogy with the bubble of nothing ) that such solutions can nucleate by tunneling when a suitable amount of energy is available .",
    "the actual fuzzball solutions involve other fields of string theory besides the metric .",
    "we may roughly picture such a fuzzball as having many kk monopoles and antimonopoles , with fluxes on the spheres between these topological objects .",
    "it was explained in @xcite how such solutions evade the conditions assumed in deriving the various types of no - hair results in earlier years .",
    "as noted in section [ sec:1 ] , the fuzzball paradigm says that a collapsing shell suffers an ` entropy enhanced tunneling ' to fuzzballs . in this section",
    "we conjecture a picture of when and where this tunneling should take place ; this picture will be consistent with causality of the underlying gravity theory .",
    "in later sections we will argue that such a picture is made possible by an altered polarization of the vacuum outside the fuzzball ( the change from rindler to ` pseudo - rindler ' ) .",
    "let the theory of gravity be such that all black hole microstates are fuzzballs . to picture these fuzzballs",
    ", we can imagine that spacetime has the topology @xmath49 , and that the radius of @xmath47 is @xmath50 .",
    "then around any point of space we can nucleate a ` bubble ' of the form ( [ metrickk ] ) , where a sphere of radius @xmath51 has been removed and the compact direction smoothly closed off at the boundary of this sphere . a general fuzzball state in string theory may be pictured as having many such bubbles with other objects like flux - carrying spheres carrying spheres linking the bubbles .    now consider a spherical shell of mass @xmath1 , collapsing radially inwards , with no other matter present .",
    "we have the following picture ( we draw the steps schematically in fig.[fig2 ] ) :    \\(a ) when the shell is far from its horizon radius @xmath2 , the motion of the shell is given by semiclassical physics ( fig.[fig2](a ) ) .",
    "\\(b ) when the shell reaches @xmath52 , with @xmath53 , there is a nucleation of ` bubbles ' just outside the location of the shell .",
    "( there can always be quantum fluctuations creating such bubbles , but they become ` less expensive ' near the shell because of the large redshift when the shell is near its horizon radius . ) the bubbles cost energy , and this energy is drawn from the shell by the process similar to the process of backreaction in pair creation .",
    "so the shell now has a lower energy , which we write as @xmath54 .",
    "this energy corresponds to a horizon radius @xmath55 ( fig.[fig2](b ) ) .",
    "\\(c ) the shell therefore travels a little further inwards without forming a horizon .",
    "as it approaches the radius @xmath56 , there is again a nucleation of bubbles .",
    "the shell loses some more energy , and so travels further inwards without creating a horizon ( fig.[fig2](c ) ) .",
    "\\(d ) the shell loses all its energy to the creation of bubbles by the time it reaches @xmath3 .",
    "the ball shaped region containing all the created bubbles is the ` fuzzball ' : the shell state @xmath12 has transitioned into a linear superposition of fuzzball eigenstates @xmath7 ( fig.[fig2](d ) ) .",
    "thus instead of a horizon , we get a horizon sized region filled with a nontrivial structure .",
    "this structure is analogous to that found in the fuzzball constructions of @xcite , where a ball shaped region is filled with monopoles / antimonopoles , with fluxes / branes wrapped on cycles stretching between the monopole centers .",
    "of course the degeneracy of states in our toy model of ` euclidean schwarzschild bubbles ' is not high , but the actual fuzzball states @xmath7 of the full string theory are expected to correspond to the @xmath57 $ ] states of the black hole , and in that case they would indeed describe a vast phase space .",
    "the conjecture of @xcite is that the large number of states that the shell can tunnel to offsets the small amplitude for tunneling to any given fuzzball state @xmath7 , so that we indeed violate the semiclassical approximation and end up with the ball depicted schematically in fig.[fig2](d ) .",

    "what tells the incoming shell that its semiclassical motion should be altered at the location ( [ qsemi ] ) ?",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , we conjecture that the spacetime outside the fuzzball of mass @xmath1 is not just the traditional vacuum : there are no particles as such in this region , but the vacuum fluctuations are different from the fluctuations of empty spacetime . in this section",
    "we will give toy examples to explain the idea of a region with altered vacuum fluctuations , and simple analogies to explain what such an altered vacuum can do .",
    "consider an example from electrodynamics , where the schwinger effect in an electric field replaces the process of pair creation in a gravitational field .",
    "consider two infinite parallel plates , with normal along the @xmath60 direction .",
    "let one plate ( carrying a positive charge density @xmath61 ) be located at @xmath62 , and the other plate ( carrying a positive charge density @xmath63 ) be located at @xmath64 . between these plates we have an electric field e = _ 0x and a potential difference v=2l",
    "|e|= 2l_0 now suppose the theory contains a scalar field @xmath31 with charge @xmath65 and mass @xmath66 .",
    "a particle - antiparticle pair of this scalar field can be produced at a minimum energy cost @xmath67 .",
    "the positively charged particle moves to the negatively charged plate and the negatively charged particle moves to the positively charged plate ; this process generates a drop in energy of @xmath68 . we therefore get a creation of particle pairs if and only if @xmath69 ; i.e. , if and only if @xmath70 where l_min = mc^2q |e|= mc^2 _ 0q    let us take @xmath71 , so we do not have any creation of particle pairs .",
    "thus there are no on - shell quanta of the field @xmath31 .",

    "it may seem that the particle creation we get this way is a small quantum effect , and so nothing dramatic happens when @xmath78 crosses @xmath79 . but now let us add to our toy model a version of ` entropy enhancement ' . instead of one scalar field @xmath31 , we take @xmath80 scalar fields @xmath81 , with n1 [ qngg ] we still set @xmath71 . thus before we add in the extra plates at @xmath82 , we have no on shell particles .",

    "but when @xmath78 crosses @xmath79 we get a large number of created pairs , and the backreaction of this pair creation can create a significant change in the dynamics of the plates at @xmath82 .    to summarize , the large number of virtual pairs of the fields @xmath81 changes the vacuum between the plates at @xmath75 , to a form different from the vacuum in a theory which did not have the fields @xmath81 .",
    "this is an example of an altered vacuum state , and we have noted that this altered state can lead to a large effect of the dynamics of the plates at @xmath82 if we assume the ` entropy enhancement ' ( [ qngg ] ) . this effect is quantum in its origin however , and would be missed if we considered only the classical dynamics of the electrodynamic setup considered here .",
    "let us now ask : what is the consequence of having a region with altered vacuum fluctuations ?",
    "we illustrate our conjecture with a schematic model :    \\(i ) consider the edge of a lake depicted in fig.[fig3 ] . on the left",
    "is land ; this represents the interior of the fuzzball @xmath23 .",
    "the water represents the exterior region @xmath19 .",
    "waves can propagate on the surface of this water , and represent matter quanta in the region @xmath19 .",
    "\\(ii ) if a quantum were travelling in flat spacetime , we would depict it by a wave on a lake with infinite depth .",
    "but as we approach @xmath22 , the vacuum gets altered more and more strongly by the effects depicted in fig.[fig1p ] . in our schematic model ,",
    "the effect of these altered fluctuations is to reduce the depth of the lake ; this depth goes to zero as we reach @xmath22 .",
    "\\(iii ) consider a shell carrying energy @xmath25 which is falling towards the fuzzball surface .",
    "this corresponds to a wave on the lake , with the wave height being proportional to @xmath25 .",
    "since the depth of the lake decreases towards the shore , there will be a point where the height of the wave becomes comparable to the depth of the lake .",
    "beyond this point the will no longer be able to travel freely as if it were a wave on a lake of infinite depth , and we expect new dynamical effects to arise . in the fuzzball , the shell of mass @xmath25 will similarly reach some location @xmath19 where it is no longer able to proceed as expected by a semiclassical analysis ; this is the point where the tunneling into fuzzballs will start to take place .    to summarize",
    ", we have argued that we should think of the spacetime outside the fuzzball ( i.e. the region @xmath19 ) as having a ` thickness ' that reaches zero at the surface of the fuzzball , and increases as we go away from the fuzzball .",
    "thus it does not make sense to ask if physics is ` normal ' outside the fuzzball : the correct question is : the physics is normal for objects upto what energy @xmath25 ?",
    "the answer would then be that the physics is normal below an energy where the shell would have started to pass through its own horizon ; and at this point we get the entropy - enhanced tunneling which changes the shell into a fuzzball .",
    "the notion that we should associate a ` thickness ' with spacetime arose in the discussion of @xcite ; let us recall this discussion here .",
    "consider the extremal 2-charge hole in string theory given by the d1d5 model .",
    "the d1d5 system is obtained by compactifying iib string theory as @xmath84 .",
    "we wrap @xmath85 d1 branes on the @xmath47 and @xmath86 d5 branes on @xmath87 .",
    "the bound state of these branes gives an effective string wound around the @xmath47 with winding number @xmath88 .",
    "this effective string can be partitioned in different ways into ` component strings ' with different windings @xmath89 .",
    "if the winding of each component string is the same , then the number of component strings is given by @xmath90 .",
    "in fig.[fig4 ] we depict two different partitions : one where all windings are unity , and one where we have a single component string of winding @xmath91 .",
    "the corresponding spacetime solutions have throats of different depth : the ones with the large winding @xmath89 has a deeper throat .",
    "we say that the geometry has been ` stretched ' more in this situation .",
    "it was then argued that this stretching gives rise to a spacetime which has a lesser ` thickness ' , in the sense that it can be more easily distorted to create a near - extremal black hole .",
    "more precisely , it was found in @xcite that the black hole threshold is reached when we send into the throat a quantum with enough energy @xmath92 to excite each component string with its lowest allowed excitation energy .",
    "if the @xmath47 has radius @xmath37 , then the lowest excitation consists of one left and one right moving vibration with energy e=1k r+1kr=2kr the minimum total energy required to excite all component strings is then e_min= ( 2kr ) n_c = 2nr 1k^2 [ qsimple ] in the gravity solution , we find that a quantum with energy @xmath93 creates a black hole ( fuzzball ) instead of just bouncing back from the ` cap ' at the end of the throat .",
    "note that all parameters like the string coupling @xmath94 and the size of the @xmath95 cancel out ; leaving the simple expression ( [ qsimple ] ) for this critical energy . since the throats where the spacetime been more stretched  the ones with larger @xmath89",
    " are more easily deformed to black holes , we say that the ` thickness ' of the space decreases when space is stretched",
    ". thus we can think of spacetime as a rubber sheet rather than just a manifold : the thickness of such a rubber sheet decreases when the sheet is stretched , while a manifold has no ` thickness ' whatsoever .",
    "two microstates of the d1d5 system and their corresponding geometries .",
    "( a ) the effective string is broken into ` singly wound cycles ' ; the corresponding geometry is a shallow throat .",
    "a quantum thrown into this throat returns back to infinity without creating a horizon .",
    "( b ) the effective string is ` multiply wound ' ; the corresponding geometry has a deep throat , and a quantum with the same energy will create a fuzzball when it reaches the location marked by the dotted circle .",
    "we say that the extra stretching in ( b ) has made the space have a smaller ` thickness ' than the space in ( a ) , so it is depicted with a thinner line . ]",
    "another system which furnishes a useful analogy for our purposes is the @xmath96 matrix model .",
    "this model does not have a black hole , or the phenomenon of ` entropy enhanced tunneling ' , so we do not capture all the features of our conjecture .",
    "but the model does have a ` fermi sea with varying depth ' , which is similar to fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the model arises from the quantization of a @xmath97 hermitian matrix with a lagrangian @xmath98 $ ] .",
    "the eigenvalues of this matrix behave like fermions , which fill a fermi sea in the ground state @xcite .",
    "small ripples on this fermi sea are described by a quadratic lagrangian , and can be mapped to a massless scalar @xmath31 .",
    "but the depth of the fermi sea goes to zero near its edge .",
    "when a ripple gets close enough to the edge that its height is comparable to the depth of the fermi sea , then a cubic term becomes relevant in the effective lagrangian for the scalar , so it no longer behaves as a free field .",
    "one can analyze the nonperturbative dynamics that results from this cubic coupling , and regard this as a model for nonperurbative effects in gravity @xcite .",
    "we can map the low energy behavior of this scalar @xmath31 to a scalar coupled to 1 + 1 dimensional dilaton gravity .",
    "we then find that the place where the ripple touches the bottom of the fermi sea is roughly the location where a black hole would have formed if the dilaton gravity description had continued to be valid @xcite .",
    "while the low energy dynamics of the fermi sea resembles dilaton gravity , there is no long - lived black hole type state in the matrix model @xcite .",
    "it might therefore seem that this model does not furnish a useful analogy for the information puzzle .",
    "but we should note that the model arises from an actual quantization of string world sheets , so it is an example of a string theory computation rather than just a schematic model .",
    "thus it is significant that this model leads to a ` fermi sea with varying depth ' in a natural way .",
    "further , the breakdown of classical evolution in this model  resulting from the formation of ` folds ' on the fermi sea  can be understood as a nonperturbative effect arising from the interaction between a large number of bosonic quanta @xcite ; thus this effect may have some similarities to the idea of ` entropy enhancement ' that we have used in our picture .",
    "degrees of freedom in the matrix model . ]",
    "while the above intuitive examples serve to illustrate the physics we are looking for , they do not tell us how a ` varying depth sea ' should actually arise .",
    "string theory is a complete theory which permits no addition of new particles or interactions .",
    "so if we wish to argue that the region outside a fuzzball is different from the conventional vacuum , then we have to conjecture a concrete source effects in string theory which can generate the required change of state .",
    "this is the question we turn to now .    in this section",
    "we explain our conjecture that vacuum fluctuations of the fuzzball change the region outside the fuzzball from rindler space to what we will call ` pseudo - rindler ' space .",
    "we will first state the context of problem we are addressing ( section [ sec:7.1 ] ) , then state our ` pseudo - rindler ' conjecture ( section [ sec:7.2 ] ) and finally use this conjecture to get a picture of infall in a theory with fuzzballs ( section [ sec:7.3 ] ) .",
    "the traditional understanding of a black hole has been dominated by two ideas :    \\(i ) the spacetime at the horizon of a large black hole is essentially a part of minkowski space in its vacuum state .",
    "\\(ii ) the region just outside the horizon is locally described by rindler space ; i.e. , the schwarzschild coordinates become the rindler coordinates which cover one quadrant of mikowski spacetime .",
    "it is true that ( ii ) is implied by ( i ) : if the region around the horizon is a patch of minkowski space , then restricting this patch to the part outside the horizon will give rindler space .",
    "but with fuzzballs , we find that ( i ) is not true : the region @xmath99 is altered to a state @xmath100 that has very low overlap with the local vacuum ( i.e. , @xmath101 )",
    ". we can now ask if ( ii ) is still true ; i.e. , is the space outside the fuzzball locally identical to the rindler quadrant of empty minkowski space ?",
    "our conjecture will be that with fuzzballs , ( ii ) is not true either : the vacuum fluctuations in this region change rindler space to what we will call ` pseudo - rindler ' space .    before we address how ( ii ) would be invalidated ,",
    "let us recall how ( i ) fails in the fuzzball paradigm .",
    "empty minkowski space has no mass : m=0 [ qtone ] if we take a black hole whose radius tends to infinity , then we have the limit m[qttwo ] classical , it appears that the spacetime generated by the limit ( [ qttwo ] ) reproduces , in a patch near the horizon , the locally flat spacetime given by ( [ qtone ] ) .",
    "but in the case ( [ qtone ] ) we have a unique ground state ; i.e. , the number of states is = 1 [ qtthree ] while in the limit ( [ qttwo ] ) the number of states goes to infinity e^s_bek(m ) [ qtfour ] in the fuzzball paradigm , the difference between ( [ qtthree ] ) and ( [ qtfour ] ) prevents us from decoupling a small region around the horizon of a black hole and treating it as a patch of empty minkowski space .",
    "the phase space volume corresponding to ( [ qtfour ] ) grows rapidly and nonlinearly with @xmath1 , and we are forced to look at the complete system as a whole when the tunneling into the fuzzball states @xmath7 becomes important .      in fig.[fig1p](a )",
    "we depict the traditional black hole with vacuum at the horizon .",
    "fig.[fig1p](b ) depicts a fuzzball .    in the region outside the horizon of the traditional hole",
    ", we have the same vacuum fluctuations as we would find locally in empty space .",
    "note that the absence of excitations like ( [ qtfive ] ) around the black hole prevents us from changing the vacuum ; this was the ` no - hair theorem ' at the quantum level .",
    "but the case is different for the fuzzball , as we see from fig.[fig1p](b ) .",
    "now we have a surface at the location @xmath58 .",
    "this surface can emit virtual quanta into the rindler region , which generates vacuum fluctuations that would be different from those in a patch of empty space .",
    "it is these fluctuations which change the spacetime around the hole from rindler to pseudo - rindler .",
    "the two questions that we must now address are :    \\(a ) what is the nature of the relevant quantum fluctuations ?",
    "\\(b ) why should such fluctuations be important for the dynamics of the hole ?",
    "let us now state conjecture our answer to these two questions in the fuzzball paradigm .",
    "( a ) suppose we start with a fuzzball of mass @xmath1 .",
    "consider a fluctuation where the configuration changes to a fuzzball of mass @xmath102 . since we do not have the extra energy @xmath25 ,",
    "this is a virtual fluctuation , just like the appearance of a virtual electron - positron pair in the vacuum .",
    "note that the amplitude for this fluctuation will be large if @xmath25 is small ; i.e. , if the hole already has a mass @xmath1 close to the value @xmath102 .",
    "we conjecture that these fluctuations of the hole into fuzzballs of larger size are the fluctuations relevant for changing the polarization of the vacuum in the region outside the fuzzball .",
    "( b ) vacuum fluctuations are normally a quantum effect , ignorable for the leading order classical approximation for macroscopic dynamics .",
    "but here we encounter the entropy - enhancement effect again : the number of virtual fuzzballs @xmath103 with mass @xmath102 is very large e^s_bek(m+m ) 1 [ ftsix ] the large number of these virtual fluctuations can compensate the low probability of the fluctuation to any individual fuzzball",
    ". thus the vacuum polarization caused by these fuzzball fluctuations can be significant .",
    "the region around the hole polarized by such fluctuations is what we call pseudo - rindler space , to distinguish it from rinder space which has just the fluctuations of empty space .",
    "let us use the conjecture above to obtain a picture of infall onto a fuzzball of mass @xmath1 .",
    "this fuzzball has a surface at @xmath104 .",
    "\\(a ) start with the fuzzball of mass @xmath1 .",
    "let a shell of mass @xmath25 be incident on this fuzzball from infinity .",
    "\\(b ) when the shell is at large radii @xmath105 it travels in the usual semiclassical approximation .",
    "the fuzzball of mass @xmath1 has fluctuations to fuzzballs of mass @xmath102 .",
    "but the region near the fuzzball has only energy @xmath1 , so these fluctuations remain virtual .",
    "\\(c ) when the shell reaches close to @xmath106 , these virtual fluctuations are able to turn into real fluctuations , since now a mass @xmath102 is available in a region with radius equal to the radius of these virtual fuzzballs",
    ". we then get the process outlines in section [ sec:3 ] where the shell breaks up into bubbles , creating a fuzzball state in the region @xmath107 . at the end of this process",
    "we are left with a fuzzball of mass @xmath102 and radius @xmath108 .",
    "our central question was : how is causality maintained during the process of transitioning to fuzzballs ?",
    "looking at the transition process conjectured in section [ sec:3 ] we see that we do not have any violation of causality ; this is because the shell never gets trapped inside its own horizon .",
    "let us analyze in more detail how such a causality preserving transition is attained in our picture .",
    "suppose the shell is composed of massless quanta that fall in radially at the speed of light . in this case",
    "it is true that the incoming shell can not influence the fuzzball surface at @xmath58 when it is still far away from this surface ; this is because there has not been time for a light signal to go from the infalling shell to the fuzzball surface .",
    "thus there is certainly no way for the infalling shell at @xmath19 to influence the fuzzball surface at @xmath58 to send an outwards signal that will change the motion of the shell .",
    "so it would seem that the shell would travel inwards while maintaining in the semiclassical approximation all the way till @xmath22 and then crash onto the fuzzball surface .",
    "but we have argued that this is not the case .",
    "the fuzzball ( describing the black hole of mass @xmath1 ) has been in existence for some time ( several crossing times , say ) .",
    "this allows the mass @xmath1 to polarize the space outside @xmath22 by virtual fluctuations of fuzzballs ( fig.[fig1p](b ) ) , without any violation of causality . in the process of reaching its final location .",
    "thus causality does not forbid this matter from influencing any location @xmath19 .",
    "] when the shell is at a position @xmath19 then it can react to the altered vacuum polarization at its position @xmath105 . when the virtual fuzzball fluctuations reaching upto location @xmath105 are more massive than the total available energy @xmath102 then they have very little effect on the infalling shell of mass @xmath25 .",
    "the situation changes at the location @xmath106 , when these virtual fluctuations can turn into on - shell fuzzball states by absorbing the energy @xmath25 of the shell .",
    "this change is quite sudden because it involves the competition between two exponentials : a decreasing one from the action required to create the massive fuzzball , and a growing one from the large degeneracy ( [ ftsix ] ) of these fuzzballs . in this manner",
    "the shell can transition to fuzzballs at a point @xmath19  before it crosses its own horizon  and without any violation of causality .",
    "given that the spacetime outside the fuzzball has an altered vacuum state , one might wonder if we should say that the fuzzball itself extends past @xmath22 .",
    "the reason that we should not say this is the following .",
    "low energy quanta travel in the region @xmath19 just as they would in empty spacetime , so for such quanta the region @xmath22 is in fact characterized accurately by the classical metric .",
    "in fact for any given mass @xmath25 of an infalling shell , the classical metric captures the dynamics to a good approximation for @xmath109 .",
    "thus we should still say that the fuzzball ends at @xmath22 , but that it alters the vacuum at @xmath19 .",
    "we have proposed that vacuum fluctuations modify the spacetime outside the fuzzball to yield pseudo - rindler spacetime , and that this effect allows causality to be maintained in the process of fuzzball formation and evaporation .",

    "this picture preserves causality , as we have noted .",
    "note that the tunneling to fuzzball states happens when the matter density in the collapsing shell is still low . as noted in section [ sec:1 ] , this is one of the aspects of the fuzzball paradigm : the large entropy of fuzzball states destroys the semiclassical approximation when the collapsing shell reaches its horizon radius . to understand this a little better",
    "let us recall a toy model presented in @xcite .",

    "the wavelength of each such created quantum is @xmath115 , which corresponds to an energy @xmath116 .",
    "suppose the number of species @xmath80 satisfies ngm^2 then the infalling shell will lose its energy to the created quanta before it reaches its horizon , and a black hole will not form .",

    "but in a theory with fuzzballs , the number of fuzzball states that we can transition to grows with @xmath1 , and so we do not form a horizon for any @xmath1 .",
    "we have conjectured that the vacuum fluctuations created by the existence of a fuzzball surface at @xmath118 polarizes the spacetime outside the fuzzball to a state different from usual empty spacetime . note that these are _ quantum _ fluctuations rather than thermal fluctuations . to see the difference , consider a an extremal hole with charge @xmath119 .",
    "the hole has a temperature @xmath120 , so there are no thermal fluctuations near the near horizon .",
    "but if we throw in a neutral shell of mass @xmath25 , then the classical dynamics would create a horizon at @xmath121 .",
    "thus to preserve causality , we would need fuzzball formation at this location @xmath122 , which would arise from nontrivial quantum fluctuations at @xmath123 .",

    "it is important to distinguish these vacuum fluctuations caused by the fuzzball from the fluctuations that we get when expressing minkowski spacetime in rindler coordinates .",
    "minkowski space of course has its own vacuum fluctuations .",
    "if we write minkowski space is rindler coordinates , then we are not changing these fluctuations : we are simply splitting them in a different way between what we call the ` vacuum ' and what we call ` particles ' .",

    "put another way , we may break up the fluctuations outside the fuzzball into two categories :    \\(i ) we have a gas of gravitons near the fuzzball surface ; these have the same temperature and energy density as the graviton gas found in rindler space .",
    "\\(ii ) we have excitations that are supported by the fuzzball surface at @xmath104 ; these fluctuations are actual deformations of the fuzzball , and would not arise if the fuzzball surface did not break the translation invariance of the local spacetime .",

    ".    ordinarily the part of the wavefunction under the barrier would not be very significant .",
    "but due to the large entropy of fuzzballs the volume of superspace where the wavefunction is under the barrier is very large .",

    "these fuzzballs thus become on - shell states , and this is the tunneling into fuzzballs that we have conjectured .    it would be interesting to explore further the wavefunctional we have conjectured where a large part is ` under the barrier ' in the form of fuzzballs . for example",

    "a black hole of mass @xmath1 has a horizon radius @xmath17 , and in the fuzzball paradigm this would be replaced by a fuzzball of radius @xmath104 .",

    "to see the power of the causality constraint , we now show that it creates a conflict between two of the assumptions made in the firewall argument .    hawking",
    "s computation showed that if we have the vacuum state at the horizon , then we will have a monotonically increasing entanglement .",

    "this converts the hawking argument into a ` theorem ' .",
    "we can state the theorem in an exactly equivalent way as follows .",
    "suppose we assume    * ass:1 * the information in the hole is radiated out the same way as by any other black body ; i .. e , there is no monotonic rise in entanglement .",
    "then the hawking theorem says that the horizon can not be a vacuum region .",
    "amps @xcite sought to make this result stronger by adding an extra assumption    * ass:2 * let the region @xmath182",
    "( i.e. , the region outside the stretched horizon ) be described by ` effective field theory ' ; i.e. , the physics outside the hole is ` normal physics ' .",
    "in particular , if a shell is approaching the stretched horizon at the speed of light , then , by causality , the stretched horizon can not respond in any way until the shell actually reaches the stretched horizon .    under these assumptions , amps argued that an infalling object will encounter radiation quanta of increasingly high energy @xmath183 as it approaches the horizon , with @xmath183 reaching planck scale at the stretched horizon .",
    "thus not only is the region near the horizon not a vacuum , it is a ` firewall ' for any object that tries to enter the hole .",
    "the intuition behind the firewall argument is simple . in hawking s pair creation from the vacuum",
    ", the particles do not actually materialize until they are well separated from the horizon ; the region around the horizon remains a vacuum .",
    "thus any actual particles ( i.e. those that can be interacted with ) are always long wavelength ( @xmath184 ) quanta .",
    "but if the radiation was emerging from a hot surface placed at the stretched horizon , then one can follow these quanta back to a location close to the stretched horizon , where they will be blueshifted to high energies",
    ". they will still be real particles however , and can interact with and burn an infalling object .",
    "but we find that there is a problem with this argument , since assumptions ass:1 and ass:2 are in conflict with each other due of the causality problem .",
    "we can see this as follows :    \\(a ) consider a black hole of mass @xmath1 .",
    "the stretched horizon is at r_s=2gm+l_p by assumption ass:2 , the region @xmath185 has ` normal physics ' , given by usual effective field theory .",
    "\\(b ) now consider a shell of radially ingoing gravitons , carrying a total energy @xmath25 since this shell moves at the speed of light , it continues to move inwards all the way to @xmath186 , with a dynamics governed just by effective field theory ( again by assumption ass:2 ) .",
    "\\(c ) the total mass of the black hole and the shell is @xmath102 , which corresponds to a horizon at the location , r=2g(m+m ) [ qttone ] from ( a ) we see that the shell must pass without drama through the location ( [ qttone ] ) .",
    "but then the information in the shell is trapped inside its own horizon , and can not reach infinity unless we have a violation of causality . from the horizon is @xmath187 , so that at 1 mm from the horizon the temperature as already lower than the microwave background of outer space . thus we can easily take @xmath25 large enough so that the shell has a negligible interaction with this radiation at the point where it passes through its horizon . ]",
    "\\(d ) but we can not violate causality in the region @xmath185 , since this region is assumed to be described by effective field theory .",
    "thus we find that the information in the shell _ can not _ be radiated to infinity , in violation of assumption ass:1 .",
    "note that if we are willing to violate causality , then there is no information puzzle in the first place ; we can always say that some mechanism takes the information from the singularity and puts it outside the hole .",
    "thus we see that causality creates a conflict between the assumptions ass:1 and ass:2 used in the firewall argument ; in consequence we can not argue that black hole horizons must act like firewalls .",
    "let us now see how the assumptions of the firewall argument differ from the situation in the fuzzball paradigm .",
    "the crucial point is that in the fuzzball paradigm , at any point @xmath185 outside the hole , we have ` normal physics ' ( effective field theory ) _ only for infalling objects up to a certain energy @xmath188 _ ; objects with energy @xmath189 will travel through the location @xmath105 without any significant departure from semiclassical evolution , while objects with energy @xmath190 will not .",
    "recalling the infall picture of section [ sec:7.3 ] , we see that the transition to fuzzballs prevents the trapping inside the horizon .",
    "by contrast , the assumptions of the firewall argument force the trapping of a massive shell inside its own horizon , and then we have a problem with causality .",
    "in the above sections we have seen how the fuzzball paradigm can solve problems ( a),(b ) while maintaining the requirement of causality in our theory of gravity . in this section we will recall the conjecture of fuzzball complementarity , which addresses a somewhat different question in black hole dynamics : the _ infall problem_. after recalling this conjecture we will note that while causality is certainly not sufficient for the conjecture to be true , it _ is _ a necessary condition for such a conjecture to be possible .      besides the questions ( a ) and ( b ) stated in section [ sec:1 ]",
    ", we can ask another question :    \\(c ) what does an infalling observer feel as he reaches the horizon of a black hole ?    in the traditional semi - classical picture of a black hole he would pass through the horizon without noticing anything special .",
    "but if the horizon is a vacuum region then we have the problems ( a),(b ) .",
    "if we have a nontrivial structure at the horizon , then we may be able to resolve ( b ) , but it seems that the observer must interact with this structure and thus not feel that he is harmlessly passing into the black hole interior .",
    "we may call ( c ) the ` infall ' .",
    "note that this question is not on the same footing as questions ( a),(b ) , in the sense that it does not relate to any fundamental problem with our theory of gravity .",
    "if the observer feels something nontrivial at the horizon , then we say that the full quantum gravity theory implies for him an experience different from the traditional semiclassical expectation .",
    "but this difference is not in conflict with some basic law of physics ; besides , we have to find a violation of the semiclassical approximation anyway to resolve the problems ( a),(b ) .",
    "on the other hand the problems ( a),(b ) are fundamental difficulties : ( a ) conflicts with causality , while ( b ) conflicts with the basic requirements of linear quantum mechanics .    in spite of the fact that there is no fundamental requirement on the nature of infall",
    ", it would be more satisfying if the classical intuition of ` free fall through the horizon ' were preserved in some way by the full quantum theory .",
    "this desire to preserve free infall gave rise to the notion of ` complementarity ' .",
    "the term arose in the work of t hooft @xcite and the idea was formulated in detail by susskind and others @xcite . in the latter approach one postulates that ` new physics ' arises when a black hole forms : the information in an infalling object can be _",
    "duplicated_. an observer outside the hole sees the information returned from the horizon to infinity , while an observer falling in with the object sees the information being carried into the hole",
    ". normally we can not duplicate information ( ` no cloning ' ) because such a duplication process conflicts with the linearity of quantum mechanics .",
    "but observers inside the hole can not communicate with the outside , so one can not easily compare the duplicate copies inside and outside the hole ; it was argued that this fact allows us to bypass the ` no cloning ' theorem when a black hole forms .",
    "there are several immediate difficulties with such a complementarity proposal .",
    "the principal one stems from the fact that the classical picture of gravitational collapse can be studied in a ` good slicing ' where nothing special happens at the horizon .",
    "what then triggers ` new physics ' when a horizon forms ?",
    "what mechanism reflects information back to infinity for an outside observer ? it was argued that the outside observer must use schwarzschild coordinates at the horizon , and quantum field have large fluctuations at the horizon in these coordinates .",
    "but such fluctuations would appear to a _",
    "coordinate _ artifact ,",
    "and so it is not clear how they could lead to a reflection of information from the horizon .",
    "lastly , if the good slicing picture were true , then how do we stop the production of entangled pairs and the corresponding problem ( b ) ?",
    "we will call the above proposal of complementarity as ` traditional complementarity ' .",
    "this will serve to distinguish it from a conjecture about infall that we can make in the fuzzball paradigm ; the latter will be termed ` fuzzball complementarity ' .          with fuzzballs",
    "we find a rather different situation from the one which led to the ideas of traditional complementarity . with traditional complementarity ,",
    "the goal was to reconcile two facts : ( i ) the horizon is in the local vacuum state @xmath191 for an infalling observer and ( ii ) information should escape from this horizon in hawking radiation . with fuzzballs ,",
    "the semiclassical approximation is violated by ` entropy enhanced tunneling ' , and @xmath9 is _ not _ a vacuum region .",
    "further , in the fuzzball paradigm we require no ` new physics ' in the presence of a black hole : all dynamics of the hole must follow from just the usual rules of string theory which is based on linear quantum mechanics .    in this situation it may appear that an infalling observer must fell that he ` crashes and burns ' at the surface of the fuzzball .",
    "indeed the firewall argument @xcite attempted to argue that any object like a fuzzball that radiated information from its surface will have to necessarily behave like a firewall for infalling observers .",
    "we have seen that the assumptions used in the firewall argument are in conflict with one another if we assume that causality holds in the underlying theory . in the picture of fuzzball formation",
    "presented above , we do maintain causality , so the firewall argument can not really apply to this picture .",
    "but one may still wonder if some modification of the firewall argument could rule out any feeling of smooth infall in the fuzzball paradigm .    in a series of papers @xcite ,",
    "a scenario was developed which allowed an infalling observer to feel no violent impact when he reaches @xmath9 , while information was still unitarily radiated from the surface of the fuzzball .",
    "the key point was that this feeling of ` free infall ' was limited to a subclass of observers : those who fall in freely from afar with an energy @xmath0 , where @xmath157 is the temperature of the hole .",
    "since @xmath192 is very small for a large hole , we see that objects with a given energy @xmath92 will feel very little unusual behavior at the horizon as the mass of the hole is taken to infinity .    in more detail ,",
    "the conjecture of fuzzball complementarity is as follows :    \\(1 ) consider the gravitational collapse of a shell depicted in fig.[fig10](b ) . at position",
    "a , the shell is far from its horizon , and its evolution is given by semiclassical gravity .    in fig.[fig10](a ) , we depict _ superspace _ , the space of all solutions of our quantum gravity theory .",
    "the wavefunction of the shell at position a is depicted schematically by the square at the center of fig.[fig10](a ) .",
    "\\(2 ) as the shell reaches its horizon @xmath9 , it will tunnel into a linear combination of fuzzballs as discussed in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "the evolution of the full quantum state is depicted by an approximately spherical wavefront in superspace , with the radius of this wavefront moving to larger values as the evolution progresses : thus the full state of the shell evolves to the wavefront b and then to the wavefront c in fig.[fig10](a ) .",
    "\\(3 ) the conjecture of fuzzball complementarity says that this evolution @xmath193 can be approximately mapped to the infall of a shell in the traditional picture of the black hole ; i.e. , the infall depicted by the locations @xmath194 in fig.[fig10](b ) .",
    "thus the actual exact wavefunctional in the full gravity theory never forms a horizon , but the evolution in _ superspace _ can be mathematically mapped to a picture where the shell is allowed to progress into the interior of an _ effective _ black hole geometry .",
    "this picture is approximate , becoming more and more accurate as we let @xmath195 .",
    "( here @xmath92 is the energy of the shell , and @xmath157 is the temperature of the hole , which in the present case is @xmath196 . )",
    "( a ) a graviton is incident on a stack of d3 branes .",
    "( b ) when the graviton hits the branes , it creates open strings , so it may appear that the graviton has been ` destroyed ' .",
    "( c ) the open strings are , however , in a definite coherent state ; we denote this by a blob which expands along the surface of the branes while maintaining its coherent structure .",
    "( d ) the expansion of the blog along the d3 branes can be mathematically mapped to the progression of the graviton into an ads space ; in this way we see that the graviton is not ` destroyed ' . ]    to understand the fuzzball complementarity conjecture better , we note that something similar happens in the case of ads / cft duality",
    ". it will be important to note both the similarities and the differences between the two situations .",
    "consider a stack of @xmath80 coincident d3-branes , depicted in fig.[figadscausality](a ) .",
    "let a graviton be incident on this stack .",
    "when the closed string representing the graviton reaches the branes , it gets converted into a collection of open strings with endpoints on the branes ( fig.[figadscausality](b ) ) .",
    "it would therefore seem that the graviton has been destroyed in the process of being absorbed by the branes .",
    "but we can replace the branes by a smooth ads space as depicted in fig.[figadscausality](d ) , and in this description the absorption process is replaced by an uneventful passage of the graviton into the ads throat . in this description",
    "it does seems that the graviton has _ not _ been destroyed .",
    "how does this description square with the earlier one in terms of open strings ?    the explanation lies in the strongly coupled nature of the gauge theory describing the open strings . while the pictorial description in terms of open strings suggests that a graviton can transition into a large number of open string configurations , the strong interactions between these open strings forces most of these states to be lifted to high energies .",
    "this leaves relatively few low energy states that are relevant for the process in question , and these states have a definite coherent structure in terms of their distribution of open strings .",
    "thus we depict these low lying states by a coherent blob on the d - branes ( rather than a gas of open strings ) ; this is depicted in fig.[figadscausality](c ) .",
    "as time passes , this blob expands on the surface of the d - branes , while maintaining its coherent internal structure .",
    "this evolution of the blob along the surface of the branes may be mapped , mathematically , to the simple evolution of the graviton into an ads interior .",
    "this is the way ads space emerges from strongly coupled gauge theory .",
    "remarkably , there _ do _ exist a large number states in the gauge theory that are not lifted to high energies : these are the states corresponding a black hole and they have a high degeneracy .",
    "but these states are not easily accessible when we start with simple configurations like those corresponding to a few high energy gravitons .",
    "the blobs corresponding to the high energy gravitons first spread over all the available d - branes , and then the state evolves to a quark - gluon plasma phase ; such plasma states are the ones that are expected to yield the entropy of a black hole .",
    "now consider the collapse of the shell depicted in fig.[fig10 ] :    \\(i ) when the shell is outside its horizon ( position a ) , the situation is analogous to the graviton being away from the d3 branes .",
    "\\(ii ) when the shell reaches @xmath9 it tunnels to fuzzballs , and the further evolution of the quantum gravity state must be described in superspace , the space of all complicated gravity configurations .",
    "this evolution is depicted by wavefronts b , c in fig.[fig10](a ) .",
    "the expanding wavefront in superspace is analogous to the expanding blob made of open strings on the d3 branes .",
    "\\(iii ) it may appear that there are many directions in superspace , and so the evolution of the wavefunctional could be a very complicated spread in all these directions .",
    "but there is a strong coupling between neighbouring configurations in superspace ; we can think of this coupling as arising from a large transition amplitude between neighbouring fuzzball configurations .",
    "this coupling lifts a large number of supersapce wavefunctionals to high energy , leaving very few low energy wavefunctionals that are relevant to the process in question . as a toy model",
    ", we can think of a 2-level system with hamiltonian h = h_0+h_1 =    e & 0 0 & e    +    0 & 1 1 & 0    the transition amplitude @xmath197 lifts the degeneracy , giving a low energy eigenvector @xmath198 with eigenvalue @xmath199 and a high energy vector @xmath200 with energy @xmath201 . in a similar way ,",
    "the low energy configurations in superspace that are easily accessed from the initial shell state @xmath12 are depicted as nearly spherical wavefronts in superspace where the wavefunction has spread almost uniformly over a large number of fuzzball configurations .",
    "\\(iv ) the evolution of the wavefronts in superspace can be mathematically mapped onto the motion of a shell that is progressing past @xmath9 into the interior of a traditional hole . as we will discuss below",
    ", it is very important that this mapping is approximate rather than exact , with the approximation improving as we let @xmath202 .",
    "this map is analogous to the map in ads / cft duality where the expanding blob in the configuration space of open strings is mapped to a graviton progressing deeper into an ads spacetime .",
    "\\(v ) there exist a large number of wavefunctionals in superspace that are _ not _ lifted to high energies , but these are not easily accessible when we start with the simple initial shell state @xmath12 .",
    "these wavefunctionals correspond to generic black hole states , and account for the bekenstein entropy @xmath11 .",
    "after the wavefunctional has moved through the stages @xmath193 and in the approximate description of fig.[fig10](b ) the shell has reached near @xmath203 , the wavefunctional in superspace starts to spread in the direction of these generic states of superspace , and this is the process of relaxation towards the generic fuzzball states which are characterized by the entropy @xmath11 .",
    "it would seem from the above discussion that the conjecture of fuzzball complementarity is very similar to the conjecture of ads / cft duality : just as the ads space emerges from the dynamics of collective excitations on d - branes , the interior of the hole can emerge from the collective dynamics of fuzzballs .",
    "but as we will now see , there is a crucial difference : fuzzball complementarity only requires an effective black hole interior to emerge when the infalling shell has energy @xmath0 .       a penrose diagram illustrating the conjecture of fuzzball complementarity .",
    "the thick left moving line represents a shell that is collapsing in flat spacetime .",
    "just before the shell reaches the horizon , it tunnels to fuzzballs ; the fuzzball surface is depicted by the thick line just outside the position where the horizon would have been .",
    "the shaded region of spacetime does not exist ; it can however be added as an approximate mathematical description of high energy infalling objects .",
    "these objects create an expanding wavefront in superspace , and the progression of this wavefront can be mathematically mapped to infall in the shaded region .",
    "the left moving arrows in the shaded region tell us that this region is an effective spacetime only for high energy left moving objects ; it is not an effective spacetime for hawking modes , which are right moving quanta . ]    in ads / cft the gauge theory dynamics of d - branes gives rise to ads spacetime .",
    "suppose the dynamics of fuzzballs really gave rise to the traditional geometry of a black hole .",
    "then we would face an immediate problem : wo nt the low energy dynamics around the horizon produce entangled pairs , just as in hawking s original computation ?",
    "if we get such pairs , then we will be back in problem ( b ) , the problem of monotonically growing entanglement .",
    "it would also seem that we can not avoid this problem by asking that the traditional geometry of the horizon emerge only approximately .",
    "the small corrections theorem @xcite says that the entanglement of the produced pairs is robust : small corrections to the state of the entangled pairs can not change the conclusion that the entanglement keeps rising monotonically .",
    "should we therefore conclude that fuzzball complementarity is not possible ; i.e. , any such conjecture would destroy the resolution we have found to puzzles ( a ) ( b ) through the fuzzball paradigm ?    the key to the conjecture of fuzzball complementarity is that the effective black hole interior only emerges for objects that are _ infalling _ with high energy onto the location @xmath9 .",
    "consider a black hole of mass @xmath1 ; this would be in a generic fuzzball configuration with radius @xmath204 .",
    "let a shell of energy @xmath205 fall onto this hole .",
    "we have the following situation :    \\(i ) the low energy outgoing quanta with energy @xmath206 have no description in terms of semiclassical modes on a traditional black hole background .",
    "these modes are emitted from the fuzzball surface and carry the information of the fuzzball , just as photons emitted from a piece of coal carry information about the coal .",
    "\\(ii ) _ infalling _ objects with energy @xmath207 have an approximate description in terms of motion in an effective black hole interior ; this description is accurate only for a brief period of infall , during which the object travels in an effective geometry between the locations @xmath9 and @xmath203 . it is these modes for which the wavefunctional in superspace spreads in the manner depicted in fig.[fig10](a ) .",
    "the reason for the difference between ( i ) and ( ii ) has to do with how many states can be accessed with the given energy ; we will discuss this in more detail below .",
    "the penrose diagram for illustrating the fuzzball complementarity conjecture was given in @xcite , and is reproduced in fig.[fig8causality ] .",
    "the actual smooth spacetime ends just outside @xmath9 at the fuzzball boundary .",
    "the region @xmath208 is depicted with left - directed arrows , to signify the fact that it arises as an effective description only for high energy _",
    "infalling _ objects .",
    "let us now come to the difference between cases ( i ) and ( ii ) above , and in particular how differentiating between these two is important in bypassing a firewall type argument",
    ". in the firewall argument one focuses on the entanglement of quanta emitted from @xmath9 which will end up as hawking radiation quanta at infinity .",
    "( these are the quanta that we term @xmath206 quanta , whatever be their position ; their energy in a local frame near the horizon will of course be blueshifted to a larger value . ) but these quanta are _ not _ those for which we ask for any complementary description in fuzzball complementarity .",
    "instead we focus on quanta which start at infinity with @xmath0 and fall in .",
    "such quanta create a large number of _ new _ degrees of freedom when they approach the fuzzball surface , and these new degrees of freedom are not entangled with anything . if we start with a hole of mass @xmath1 and add an energy @xmath92 , the total number of final states is related to the number of initial states as & = & exp[s_bek(m+e)]exp[s_bek(m ) ] & & exp[s_bek]exp[e / t]1 [ qwone ] thus a high energy infalling quantum creates a large number of new degrees of freedom , and it is the evolution of these ( unentangled ) new degrees of freedom that is described by the conjecture of fuzzball complementarity .",
    "we can now see the difference between the cases ( i ) and ( ii ) above . in case ( ii )",
    "we have @xmath0 , and the large number of new degrees of freedom ( [ qwone ] ) have very little to do with the initial state of the fuzzball before the new energy @xmath92 was added .",
    "thus these evolution of these new degrees of freedom can have a universal form given by the wavefronts in fig.[fig10](a ) .",
    "but in case ( i ) the infalling quantum adds only @xmath114 new bits to the fuzzball .",
    "the quantum reaches within @xmath209 of the fuzzball surface before creating the new bit , and so its evolution is strongly influenced by the initial state of the fuzzball .",
    "thus there is no approximation of ` effectively smooth infall ' that is available for such @xmath206 quanta .    in @xcite a bit model was presented where information escaped in low energy ( @xmath206 ) modes while the high energy ( @xmath0 ) infalling modes had an effective evolution mimicking infall into a black hole interior .",
    "this model therefore gives an explicit counter to the firewall argument .",
    "finally let us come to the relation between fuzzball complementarity and the subject of the present paper : causality .",
    "the conjecture of fuzzball complementarity uses the fact that an infalling object transitions to fuzzballs just before the place where it would have created the horizon . having a transition at this location ( or earlier )",
    "is required by causality , as we have noted .",
    "the spread of the wavefunctional in superspace then gives an effective evolution that can be interpreted as infall into a black hole interior .",
    "suppose on the other hand we had the set - up assumed in the firewall argument of @xcite .",
    "let the infalling object be composed of massless radially infalling quanta .",
    "in this case the assumptions of the firewall argument would demand that the object approach the horizon of the existing hole without any novel quantum gravity effects being relevant .",
    "the infalling quanta would however interact with the radiation being emitted from @xmath9 .",
    "this interaction would destroy the infalling object , and then we can not hope for any complementary description in which one would see free infall through the horizon .    to make this concrete ,",
    "let us outline argument of @xcite in the present context .",
    "let the hole be past its halfway point of evaporation .",
    "a radiation quantum @xmath210 being emitted from the hole has a state which is close to maximally entangled with states @xmath211 at infinity , so that the relevant part of the quantum state is ( |+_h |out_1 + |-_h|out_2 ) where @xmath212 are the spin states for @xmath210 .",
    "now consider the infalling object to be a quantum in a state @xmath213 .",
    "this quantum can scatter off the two spin states of @xmath210 in different ways ; for example |q|+_h    @xmath214 are two orthogonal states of @xmath65 .",
    "since the energy of the radiation quantum @xmath210 goes to the planck scale as we follow it back to the stretched horizon , the probability of such a scattering is high if we are allowed to follow @xmath65 all the way to the stretched horizon .",
    "after this scattering the overall state of @xmath215 and the radiation at infinity has the form |= 1 ( |+_h |out_1 |q_1 +    @xmath65 . in obtaining complementarity",
    "we are allowed to make a change of basis , and with this change of basis the evolution of @xmath65 must become one where @xmath65 did not change its state when it passes through @xmath9 .",
    "but should this change of basis map @xmath216 or @xmath217 ? since we can make at most one of these choices , we see we can not make a change of variables where @xmath65 feels no change at the horizon .",
    "but as we have noted above , if we let @xmath65 reach the stretched horizon as required by the assumptions of the firewall argument then we have a problem with causality : @xmath65 is trapped inside its own horizon and can not sent its information to infinity without information transfer outside the light cone . in the fuzzball paradigm the @xmath65 transitions to fuzzballs before reaching the stretched horizon . the distance from the stretched horizon where this transition occurs increases with @xmath218 .",
    "thus for large @xmath92 the radiation at the point of transition is not strong enough to give any significant interaction between @xmath210 and @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "the effective infall description is then encoded in the new degrees of freedom ( counted as in ( [ qwone ] ) ) which are created by the energy @xmath92 , and the subsequent evolution in superspace of the fuzzball configuration ( fig.[fig10 ] ) generated by these degrees of freedom .",
    "thus we see that fuzzball complementarity evades the firewall argument by the same mechanism by which it avoids the causality problem .",
    "let us note the three different categories of solutions that have been proposed to deal with the information paradox :    \\(1 ) _ remnants : _ the data of the infalling shell ( and the negative energy partners of hawking radiation quanta ) stay trapped in a planck sized object .",
    "\\(2 ) _ fuzzballs : _ string theory yields states that do not collapse under their own gravity , and such states describe the microstates of black holes . thus there is no horizon or singularity .",
    "in particular the absence of a vacuum region around a horizon implies that we do not get the creation of entangled pairs by hawking s mechanism @xcite , and this resolves the entanglement problem ( b ) .",
    "\\(3 ) _ wormholes : _ the horizon is a vacuum region , but novel physics intervenes to resolve the information puzzle .",
    "the new physical concept is that the degrees of freedom near infinity are not distinct from the degrees of freedom inside the horizon @xcite .",
    "we may depict this identification of degrees of freedom by a set of thin wormholes that connect the interior of the hole to the radiation quanta at infinity .",
    "more generally , one could conjecture nonlocal effects over different length scales : giddings @xcite has conjectured nolocality for low energy modes over scales @xmath219 , while hawking et .",
    "al @xcite have conjectured that the degrees of freedom of the hole may live at infinity , being encoded in diffeomorphisms that do not vanish at the boundary of spacetime .",
    "we now summarize the various aspects of the fuzzball paradigm ( 2 ) , and then note the relation between these aspects and the issue of causality that we have discussed in this paper .",
    "the fuzzball paradigm has four different results / conjectures , that are loosely related with each other :    \\(i ) the actual fuzzball construction , which gives explicit examples of black hole microstates in string theory with no horizon or singularity @xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) the small corrections theorem , which says that we can not remove the problem of growing entanglement by small corrections to the states of the created pairs @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) the conjecture that the semiclassical approximation is violated at the horizon scale by ` entropy enhanced tunneling ' into fuzzballs @xcite .",
    "\\(iv ) the conjecture of ` fuzzball complementarity ' , which says that it may be possible to preserve a notion of approximate semiclassical infall for infalling observers that fall in freely from afar with @xmath0 @xcite .    from ( ii ) we see that we must have an order unity change to the evolution at the horizon .",
    "one may try to avoid this conclusion by having a nonlocal identification of degrees of freedom of the kind proposed in the wormhole scenario .",
    "but if we have nonlocality , then we typically lose causality as well .",
    "the construction ( i ) is of course the central feature of the fuzzball paradigm , which makes the rest of the picture possible . in a theory which did not have fuzzballs ,",
    "an infalling shell would pass smoothly through its horizon , and we would then need to violate causality if we wish to have its information emerge in hawking radiation . the conjecture ( iii )",
    "allows the fuzzball effects to start at the location where a horizon would have appeared , and this is needed to prevent trapping inside the new horizon .",
    "finally , the same effects that give causality also allow us to have the conjecture of fuzzball complementarity ( iv ) , though this conjecture is not required by causality .",
    "the firewall argument @xcite assumes that an infalling shell will see no novel effects of quantum gravity until it reaches @xmath220 ; this is called ` validity of effective field theory ' outside the stretched horizon. in this situation a shell of mass @xmath25 will be trapped inside its own horizon at @xmath106 , and we will have to violate causality if we require that its information emerge in hawking radiation .",
    "we have noted that this sets up a contradiction between two of the postulates assumed in the firewall argument .",
    "( if we do not assume that effective field theory is valid outside the stretched horizon then we can not prove that there must be a firewall ; in fact in this situation we can construct an explicit bit model @xcite which gives ` fuzzball complementarity ' for @xmath0 infalling objects . )    from the perspective of our picture , the problem with the firewall approach arises from asking the question : is effective field theory valid outside the stretched horizon or not ? in the actual situation conjectured here , effective field theory is valid at a given position @xmath19 _ for objects upto a certain energy @xmath92 , and not for objects of higher energy_. with this picture we resolve all the problems with the quantum theory of black holes .",
    "finally , one may ask if it is essential to require causality in a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "one may argue that quantum fluctuations of the metric will lead to a fluctuation of light cones , so that no strict causality is possible .",
    "but perturbative diagrams in general relativity and string theory preserve causality , and the nonperturbative aspects of string theory have shown no violation of causality either . even the very nonperturbative gravity process of bubble nucleation in a false vacuum respects causality : the nucleated universe expands at a speed less than the speed of light as seen from the both the true and the false vacuum regions",
    ". note also that some fundamental approaches to developing a theory of quantum gravity have the notion of causality built in from the start @xcite .    to understand how there can be some notion of causality in a theory with fluctuating metrics ,",
    "consider a maximally symmetric space like minkowski spacetime .",
    "this symmetry group is defined using coordinates @xmath221 and a fiducial metric @xmath222 .",
    "the fluctuations around this fiducial metric are not completely arbitrary : they must satisfy the requirement that the full wavefunctional preserve the poincare symmetry group .",
    "we can then define causality using the light cones of the fiducial metric @xmath222 ; i.e. , ask that commutators of local field operators vanish strictly outside the light cones defined by @xmath222 .",
    "the schwarzschild metric is not a maximally symmetric space , but the curvature away from the singularity is small , and so any ambiguities in defining causality in the region @xmath223 should also be small .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the information puzzle is resolved by effects that violate causality .",
    "if we assume that causality holds , then we have argued that the only way to get information to emerge in the hawking radiation is to have an alteration of quantum fluctuations in the region outside the fuzzball ; i.e. , replace the rindler region of the traditional black hole by pseudo - rindler space .",

    "<S> the black hole information paradox is really a combination of two problems : the causality paradox and the entanglement problem . </S>",
    "<S> the causality paradox arises because in the semiclassical approximation infalling matter gets causally trapped inside its own horizon ; it is therefore unable to send its information back to infinity if we disallow propagation outside the light cone . </S>",
    "<S> we show how the causality paradox is resolved in the fuzzball paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> one needs to distinguish between two kinds of rindler spaces : ( a ) rindler space obtained by choosing accelerating coordinates in minkowski space and ( b ) ` pseudo - rindler ' space , which describes the region near the surface of a fuzzball . </S>",
    "<S> these two spaces differ in their vacuum fluctuations . while low energy waves propagate the same way on both spaces , infalling objects with energies @xmath0 suffer an ` entropy enhanced tunneling ' in the pseudo - rindler spacetime ( b ) ; this leads to the nucleation of a fuzzball before the infalling object gets trapped inside a horizon . </S>"
