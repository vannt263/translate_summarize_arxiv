    "for a long time , it was assumed that neutrinos have vanishing quantities : @xmath0 , and @xmath1 . among these the neutrino mass problem",
    "has attracted the most attention , and finally we might have an evidence for nonzero neutrino mass  @xcite . the other important neutrino property to be exploited",
    "is the electromagnetic property , in particular the magnetc moment .",
    "the reason for vanishing neutrino mass was very naive in 50 s and 60 s : the hypothesis of the @xmath2-invariance . under the @xmath2-invariance , @xmath3",
    ", @xmath4 appears only in one chirality . in the standard model ( sm ) , this is encoded as no right - handed neutrino .    in gauge theory models ,",
    "the story changes because one can calculate the properties of the neutrino at high precision . in sm",
    ", one can not write a mass term for @xmath4 in @xmath5 terms . to write a mass term for @xmath4",
    ", one has to introduce @xmath6 terms , or introduce singlet neutrino(s ) .",
    "the two - component neutrino we consider in the left - handed doublet can be weyl or majorana type .",
    "if it is a weyl neutrino , it satisfies @xmath7 where @xmath8 or @xmath9 .",
    "then the magnetic moment term is given by @xmath10 .",
    "$ ] therefore , to have a nonvanishing magnetic moment ( or mass ) , we must require @xmath11 , i.e. the existence of right - handed singlet neutrino(s ) .    for majorana neutrinos , @xmath12 ,",
    "it is possible to write a mass term without introducing right - handed neutrino(s ) .",
    "thus , it is possible to introduce neutrino masses and magnetic moments in the sm , by a slight extension of the model .",
    "the question is how large they are .    for the detection of neutrino masses and oscillations ,",
    "there have been numerous studies from solar- , atmospheric- , reactor- , and accelerator - neutrino experiments .",
    "the effect of neutrinos in cosmology was also used to get bounds on neutrino masses . on the other hand , for the neutrino magnetic moment astrophysical constraints gave useful bounds .",
    "usually , the bound of the neutrino magnetic moment is given in units ( @xmath13 ) of bohr magneton ( @xmath14 ) , @xmath15",
    "the first significant bound on magnetic moment of @xmath16 was given from astrophysics , @xmath17 , by bernstein et al .",
    "@xcite . a better bound on @xmath18 was obtained from sn1987a , @xmath19  @xcite .    for the muon neutrino",
    ", the useful bound was obtained from the neutral current data  @xcite , @xmath20 .",
    "the first bound on the transition magnetic moment was given also from the neutral current experiment  @xcite .",
    "for the tau neutrino , @xmath21 has been obtained recently  @xcite .    for the theoretical side ,",
    "it has been known from early days that it is possible to generate large magnetic moments for neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "note that the see - saw mass for neutrinos appear as in fig .  1 .",
    "here , there does not exist any charged particle and hence there is no contribution to magnetic moment at this level .",
    "thus to have a large neutrino magnetic moments , one needs a feynman diagram of fig .",
    "2 type , where we introduced a heavy lepton @xmath22 coupling to @xmath23 via    @xmath24    then one can easily estimate the magnetic moment of neutrinos as  @xcite is the transition moment . ]",
    "@xmath25 where @xmath26 , which is a function of mixing and feynman integral , is of order 1 .",
    "one can also draw feynman diagrams with charged scalars in the loop with appropriate yukawa interactions introduced .",
    "this kind of diagrams generally introduce transition magnetic moment of order@xmath27 where @xmath28 is the mass of the intermediate scalar or gauge boson .",
    "note that without extra charged leptons @xmath29 should be neutrino mass , rendering an extremely small @xmath30 .",
    "the super - k collaboration has reported the ratio @xmath34 which is consistent with 1 at present .",
    "however , one may narrow down the experimental errors and can observe whether it is different from 1 or not .",
    "one assumes that @xmath16 is not oscillated in the atmospheric neutrino data sample , and hence the mc electrons are estimated with the standard cc cross section .",
    "the denominator is calculated assuming that the nc is the same for the cases with and without neutrino oscillation .",
    "so @xmath35 is expected to be 1 if there is no oscillation of sm neutrinos to sterile neutrinos .",
    "if there exist oscillation of @xmath36 to sterile neutrinos , then one expects that @xmath37 .    however , in our recent work  @xcite we pointed out that one should be careful to draw a firm conclusion on this matter because if a sizable transition magnetic moment of @xmath36 exists then one expects a different conclusion .    for the study of nc ,",
    "the single @xmath32 production is known to be very useful .",
    "most dominant contribution to the single @xmath32 production at the atmospheric neutrino energy is through @xmath38 production , @xmath39 in this calculation , we used the form factors given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for @xmath40  gev or the kinetic energy of recoil nucleon @xmath41  gev ,",
    "the process @xmath42 is difficult to observe at super - k .",
    "so the @xmath32 production is the cleanest way to detect nc interactions through cherenkov ring ( from @xmath32 decay ) at super - k .    for transition",
    "magnetic moment parametrized by @xmath43 , @xmath44 where @xmath45 , the single @xmath32 production cross section through @xmath38 production is given in ref .  @xcite . in fig .  3",
    ", we show the result ( the ratio of the neutrino magnetic moment contribution and the nc contribution ) as a function of neutrino energy .",
    "note that the magnetic moment part is more important at low @xmath46 region due to the photon propagator . in principle",
    ", one can distinguish neutrino magnetic moment interactions from the nc interactions . from fig .  3 ,",
    "if we require @xmath47 , then we obtain a bound @xmath48 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the transition magnetic moment @xmath43 can be large . for @xmath49",
    "heavy , it is not restricted by sn1987a bound . but atmospheric neutrinos of 110  gev can produce @xmath49 , and can mimick nc data  @xcite . before interpreting nc effects from atmospheric neutrino data , one has to separate out the @xmath50 contribution .",
    "before closing , we point out @xmath30 and solar neutrino problem . one possibility to reduce solar @xmath16 flux is to precess @xmath51 to @xmath52 with a large @xmath30 in a strong magnetic field  @xcite .",
    "but this idea seems to be ruled out by the nucleosynthesis argument  @xcite , @xmath53 , and the sn1987a argument  @xcite , @xmath54 .",
    "the sn1987a bound is coming from the energy loss mechanism : if @xmath55 is created , it takes out energy out of the core .",
    "but if it is trapped , then the bound does not apply .",
    "are not restricted by these bounds for a heavy enough @xmath49 , but then the transition magnetic moment can not account for the solar neutrino deficit . ]",
    "the solar neutrino problem requires @xmath56 which is considered to be large .",
    "to use the idea of trapping , the oscillation is @xmath57 namely , we use the konopinski - mahmoud scheme where @xmath58 is the weak interaction partner of @xmath59 , implying the oscillated neutrino participates in weak interactions ; hence trapped in the supernova core .",
    "this picture is very restrictive as suggested by models given in ref .",
    "these models try to get a large neutrino magnetic moment while keeping the neutrino mass small .",
    "the @xmath60 symmetry in which @xmath61 forms a doublet under @xmath60 is introduced for this purpose . in this case",
    ", @xmath62-number minus electron - number is conserved .",
    "the reason for vanishing mass is that @xmath63 is symmetric under @xmath60 , i.e. the mass term is a triplet under @xmath60 and hence is forbidden . on the other hand the magnetic moment term , @xmath64 , is a singlet and is allowed , as given in fig .  4 . but , _",
    "why @xmath60 ? _",
    "it is like the dilemma asked in any fermion mass ansatz problem .",
