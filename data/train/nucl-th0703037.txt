    "over the last several years , many theoretical and experimental efforts have been devoted for investigations of deeply - bound kaonic nuclei @xcite , but there is no conclusive proof on their existence at the present stage . in order to study properties of antikaon @xmath12 in nuclear medium , it is an important subject to verify the reliable evidence of deeply - bound kaonic nuclei because antikaons might condense in the interior of compact star @xcite .    among various antikaon nuclear systems , the three - body @xmath13 bound state with a configuration of @xmath14_{i=1/2}$ ]",
    "is expected to be the lightest and the most fundamental kaonic nucleus .",
    "this state is symbolically called `` @xmath0 '' in this paper . in 1963 , nogami @xcite has firstly suggested a possible existence of the @xmath0 bound state by a rather crude calculation .",
    "about 40 years later , yamazaki and akaishi @xcite restarted to study the structure of the @xmath0 bound state on the basis of a quantitative few - body calculation with the brueckner theory , and predicted that the binding energy and width for @xmath2 are @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 mev , respectively .",
    "shevchenko , gal and mare@xmath17 @xcite performed the @xmath18-@xmath19 coupled channel calculation for the @xmath0 bound state by the faddeev approach , and obtained @xmath20 = 55 - 70 mev and @xmath21 = 95 - 110 mev .",
    "several theoretical works @xcite also supported the existence of the @xmath0 bound state , but the calculated binding energy and width are not converged theoretically .    on the other hand , finuda collaboration at da@xmath22ne @xcite reported experimentally evidence of a deeply - bound @xmath0 state in invariant mass spectroscopy by @xmath0 @xmath23 @xmath24 + @xmath25 decay processes from @xmath2 absorption on @xmath26li , @xmath27li and @xmath28c at rest . the measured energy and width are @xmath29 mev and @xmath30 mev , respectively . however , magas @xmath31 @xmath32 @xcite claimed that it is not necessary to postulate a @xmath0 bound state in order to explain a bump structure in the finuda data , because of the @xmath33+@xmath34 pair interaction with the residual nucleus , following the @xmath2 absorption on two nucleons in these nuclei . although this data analysis is continued by the finuda group , the situation is still unsettled .",
    "more experimental data are required in order to confirm whether the @xmath0 system has a deeply - bound state or not .",
    "recently , iwasaki @xmath31 @xmath32 @xcite proposed a new experiment searching the deeply - bound @xmath0 state at j - parc , by the missing - mass spectrum of the @xmath1he(in - flight @xmath2,@xmath3 ) reaction , together with the invariant - mass spectra detecting all particles via decay processes from the @xmath0 bound state ( j - parc e15 ) .",
    "our purpose is to clarify theoretically the expected inclusive and semi - exclusive spectra of the @xmath1he(in - flight @xmath2,@xmath3 ) reaction for preparing the forthcoming j - parc e15 experiment .",
    "as for ( in - flight @xmath2,@xmath34 ) reactions on @xmath28c and @xmath35o targets , kishimoto @xmath31 @xmath36 .",
    "@xcite performed measurements for searching deeply - bound kaonic nuclei , but no clear evidence was observed .",
    "@xmath32 @xcite calculated the corresponding inclusive spectra by @xmath28c,@xmath35o(in - flight @xmath2 , @xmath25 ) reactions , using @xmath2 optical potentials based on chiral unitary and phenomenological approaches ; they suggested that any distinct peaks of deeply - bound kaonic states will not be observed even if the bound states exist .",
    "the predicted states can not be separated due to their broad width .",
    "it would be naively expected that if we choose a lighter nucleus as a target , a signal for formation of kaonic nuclei appears more clearly , whereas no theoretical calculation has been done for the @xmath1he target so far .",
    "yamazaki and akaishi @xcite also proposed the @xmath0 formation via @xmath37 , assuming a @xmath38 doorway .",
    "such a @xmath0 experiment with a @xmath394 gev proton beam on a deuterium target is planned by fopi collaboration at gsi @xcite .    in this letter , we demonstrate firstly the inclusive and semi - exclusive spectra of the @xmath1he(in - flight @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) reaction at @xmath4 = 1.0 gev / c and @xmath5 within the distorted wave impulse approximation ( dwia ) , in order to predict the production cross section of the @xmath0 bound state and to examine the experimental feasibility . as studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , we employ the green s function method by morimatsu and yazaki @xcite in the dwia framework , which describes well unstable hadron nuclear systems , comparing theoretical spectra with experimental ones @xcite .",
    "in the dwia framework @xcite , the inclusive double - differential cross section of the @xmath1he(in - flight @xmath2,@xmath3 ) reaction at the forward direction @xmath40 in the lab system is written @xcite as @xmath41^{({\\rm elem } ) } \\ , s(e ) , \\label{eq : dwia}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42^{({\\rm elem})}$ ] is a fermi - averaged cross section for the elementary @xmath43 forward scattering which is equivalent to a backward @xmath44 elastic scattering @xcite in the lab system . here",
    "we consider only the non - spin - flip @xmath45 reaction channel . the kinematical factor @xmath46 @xcite expresses the translation from the two - body @xmath2-@xmath34 lab system to the @xmath2-@xmath1he lab system @xcite , and it is defined as @xmath47 where @xmath4 is the incident @xmath48 momentum , and @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) denote the outgoing neutron momenta ( energies ) for a nucleon target and @xmath1he target , respectively , in the lab frame ; @xmath53 is the residual @xmath2 energy in the final state .",
    "@xmath54 denotes the strength function of the @xmath0 system , which is expressed in the green s function method @xcite , as @xmath55 \\label{eq : s(e)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath56 where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is distorted waves of the incoming @xmath2 ( outgoing neutron ) with the momentum @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) ; @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the masses of the @xmath1he target , the core - nucleus and the @xmath0 system , respectively .",
    "the factor of @xmath64 and @xmath65 takes into account the recoil effects .",
    "here we assumed to use the recoil factor of @xmath65 in not only @xmath58 but also @xmath57 , for simplicity .",
    "@xmath66 is a hole - state wave function for a struck neutron in the target , where @xmath67 denotes the complete set of eigenstates for the system .",
    "we employ a simple ( 1s)@xmath1 harmonic oscillator model for the @xmath1he wave function .",
    "then , the relative @xmath68-@xmath34 wave function has the form of @xmath69 , @xmath70 .",
    "the size parameter @xmath71 is taken to be 1.30 fm , which reproduces the recent experimental r.m.s charge radius of @xmath1he , @xmath72 fm @xcite . in this calculation , we assumed the `` @xmath6 '' pair as a rigid core with @xmath73 , for simplicity",
    ". this assumption would be suitable for describing the considerable structure of the deeply - bound @xmath0 state , as mentioned below .",
    "therefore , green s function for the @xmath0 system , @xmath74 , in eq.([eq : s(e ) ] ) is obtained by solving numerically the following klein - gordon equation with a @xmath2-@xmath6 optical potential @xmath75 ; @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the reduced mass between the @xmath2 and the `` @xmath6 '' core - nucleus , and @xmath78 the coulomb potential with the finite nuclear size effect .",
    "moreover , the strength function @xmath54 can be decomposed into two parts @xcite as @xmath79 where @xmath80 describes the @xmath2 conversion processes including the decay modes of @xmath81 ( mesonic ) from the one - body absorption and @xmath82 ( nonmesonic ) from the two - body absorption , and @xmath83(e ) the @xmath2 escaping processes leaving the core - nucleus in the ground state : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the free green s function .",
    "here we used an abbreviated notation for @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath75 .",

    "yamazaki and akaishi @xcite obtained the @xmath0 optical potential between the @xmath2 and the `` @xmath6 '' pair , performing a variational three - body calculation .",
    "this ya optical potential is parametrized in a gaussian form with a range - parameter @xmath98 fm , as @xmath99 , \\label{eq : kppoptpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 mev and @xmath101 mev .",
    "note that these parameters are determined within a non - relativistic framework . solving the klein - gordon equation with this potential , we find that the @xmath2 binding energy and width account for @xmath102 mev and @xmath103 mev , respectively .",
    "although these values are slightly changed from @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 mev given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we employ the ya potential having ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) = ( @xmath104 mev , @xmath105 mev ) as a standard one , for a first step toward our quantitative investigation .",
    "shevchenko , gal and mare@xmath17 @xcite also obtained @xmath106 mev and @xmath107 mev as the maximum values for the @xmath0 bound state by the faddeev calculation .",
    "we can simulate @xmath108 mev and @xmath109 mev as a complex klein - gordon energy , adjusting the parameters to ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) = ( @xmath110 mev , @xmath111 mev ) within the potential form of eq.([eq : kppoptpot ] ) .",
    "we adopt these values of @xmath112 as an upper limit for the reliable parameters .",
    "let us consider the @xmath1he(in - flight @xmath2,@xmath3 ) reaction at the incident @xmath2 momentum @xmath4=1.0 gev / c and the forward direction @xmath113 , where the lab cross section of the elementary reaction process is maximal @xcite .",
    "the lab cross section for the @xmath45 forward scattering is @xmath3927 mb / sr @xcite in free space , and is reduced to @xmath3915 mb / sr with fermi - averaging @xcite .",
    "these values are about three times larger than those for the @xmath114 forward scattering for the ( @xmath2 , @xmath25 ) reaction at @xmath115 1.0 gev / c , e.g. , 8.8 mb / sr @xcite in free space and 5.2 mb / sr @xcite with fermi - averaging .",
    "we adopt 15 mb / sr as a value of @xmath42^{({\\rm elem})}$ ] in eq.([eq : dwia ] ) , and we notice that the momentum transfer @xmath116 is negative ( @xmath117 ) which means that the residual @xmath2 recoils backwards relative to the incident @xmath2 in the lab frame , therefore , the kinematical factor @xmath46 in eq.([eq : beta ] ) enhances the spectrum by a factor 1 - 2 depending on @xmath118 1.0 - 1.4 gev / c .    for missing - mass spectroscopy , fig .",
    "[ yaspec ] shows the calculated inclusive spectrum of the @xmath1he(in - flight @xmath2,@xmath3 ) reaction as a function of the ejected neutron momentum @xmath50 , and the components of the partial - wave angular momentum states with @xmath119 .",
    "here we used the ya potential with ( @xmath7 , @xmath8)=(@xmath104 mev , @xmath105 mev ) .",
    "we find that a distinct peak of the @xmath0 bound state with @xmath9 , @xmath120=0@xmath121 ( @xmath122 ) appears around @xmath123 1280 mev / c , which has @xmath124 50 mev and @xmath125 70 mev . the absolute value of the integrated formation cross section amounts to 3.5 mb / sr .",
    "note that the effective neutron number with the distortion for the @xmath0 bound state is @xmath126= 0.23 with @xmath127= 0.47 , of which value is more than ten times as large as the effective proton number @xmath128= 0.013 with @xmath127=0.095 for the @xmath2 nuclear @xmath129 bound state via the @xmath130 transition in @xmath28c @xcite .",
    "this is a major advantage of the use of the @xmath131-shell target nucleus such as @xmath1he .",
    "we stress that the calculated spectrum consists of mainly the states with @xmath132 below the @xmath2 emitted threshold ( @xmath118 1224 mev / c ) , whereas the components of @xmath133 dominates continuum states for the quasi - free ( qf ) region . this @xmath134 dominance in the bound region",
    "is caused by a small size of the @xmath131-shell nucleus , contrast to the case of @xmath25-shell nuclei , @xmath28c and @xmath35o .",
    "moreover , the recoil effects for the light @xmath131-shell nuclear target play an important role in increasing the cross section of the @xmath0 bound state ; if we replace the recoil factors of both @xmath65 and @xmath64 by 1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi+- ] ) , the cross section of the peak in the bound region is reduced by half , whereas the yields in the qf region grow up , and the qf peak is shifted to the lower @xmath50 side and its width is broader .",
    "when we use a reasonable factor of @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the mean mass of @xmath61 and @xmath63 , instead of @xmath65 , we find that the cross section around the peak in the bound region is enhanced by about 10% .",
    " fig.1     in fig .",
    "[ yaspec2 ] , we display contributions of the @xmath2 escape and conversion components into the inclusive spectrum , using the ya potential . since the `` @xmath6 '' rigid - core nucleus is assumed in this calculation , the @xmath18 continuum spectrum is described as @xmath2+``@xmath6 '' continuum states .",
    "thus the @xmath2 escape spectrum in eq.([eq : sesc ] ) might not be fully explained in the qf region where the @xmath1he break - up processes of @xmath137 occur . on the other hand , this assumption seems to work well in the bound region ; decay processes of @xmath138 and @xmath139 are effectively described by the imaginary potential , im@xmath140 , if we choose an appropriate one .",
    "such a conversion spectrum in eq.([eq : scon ] ) expresses semi - exclusive @xmath141 processes detecting the selected particles in invariant - mass spectroscopy at the j - parc e15 experiment .",
    "therefore , the treatment of the `` @xmath6 '' core - nucleus would be justified in not only the bound region but also the continuum region , as long as we concern the conversion spectrum . in fig .",
    "[ sgmspec2 ] , we show also the escape and conversion spectra using ( @xmath7 , @xmath8)=(@xmath110 mev , @xmath111 mev ) , in order to simulate the results by shevchenko , gal and mare@xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we confirm that a peak of the @xmath0 bound state is broadened because a value of @xmath142 is so larger than that obtained by the ya potential .",
    "the corresponding bump is barely recognized in the spectrum .     fig.2      fig.3     mare@xmath17 , friedman and gal @xcite introduced a phase space suppression factor @xmath143 multiplying the imaginary part of the @xmath2 optical potential . when a pole of the @xmath0 bound state is located below the @xmath19 threshold in the complex energy plane",
    ", its width would be narrower by the phase space suppression because the @xmath144 decay channel is closed there .",
    "several predictions for the @xmath0 bound state @xcite suggest that its pole resides above the @xmath19 threshold , except the results in ref .  @xcite . in order to see the effects , we replace @xmath8 by @xmath145 in eq.([eq : kppoptpot ] ) .",
    "here we assumed that the @xmath2 is absorbed from 80 % one - nucleon and 20 % two - nucleons , as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . indeed ,",
    "the helium bubble chamber experiment @xcite suggested that the ratio of @xmath2 absorption on two nucleons to all @xmath2 absorption process in @xmath146he at rest amounts to 16 % .",
    "taking into account the phase space factor , we adjust a value of @xmath8 to be @xmath147 mev so as to reproduce the same @xmath142 of the @xmath0 bound state .",
    "since @xmath80 can be further decomposed into the corresponding spectra from the one- and two - nucleon absorptions , we can estimate each component for these decay modes .",
    "[ ay - edep ] shows the effects of the phase space factor in the calculated spectrum .",
    "we find that the shape of the inclusive spectrum is not so changed when the phase space factor is turned on ; the spectrum of the @xmath0 bound state , however , is sizably reduced near the @xmath19 threshold ( @xmath148 mev / c ) because the @xmath0 below the threshold can decay into only the @xmath149 process from the two - nucleon absorption , which contributes slightly to the spectrum on the whole .    ",
    "fig.4     it is worth studying shape behaviors of the strength function @xmath54 for the @xmath0 bound state on the parameters of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , systematically . as shown in fig .",
    "[ svdep ] , we change the value of @xmath7 from @xmath150 mev to @xmath110 mev , keeping @xmath101 mev .",
    "we see that a peak of the bound state gives rise to a cusp - like structure at @xmath151-@xmath152 mev ( shallow ) . in fig .",
    "[ swdep ] , we show the shape behavior of @xmath54 when we change the value of @xmath8 from @xmath153 mev to @xmath154 mev , keeping @xmath100 mev .",
    "we find that choosing @xmath155 mev ( deep ) , the peak is completely invisible even if the bound state exists . consequently , in order to identify a peak of the @xmath0 bound state in the inclusive spectrum , we realize that the value of @xmath7 must be deeper than @xmath156 mev and also that of @xmath8 shallower than @xmath156 mev .",
    "the parameter set for the ya potential @xcite fulfills this condition , while that simulating the results by shevchenko , gal and mare@xmath17 @xcite stands on the edge of the signal observation in terms of the width .",
    "we believe that it is possible to extract variable information on the @xmath2 optical potential from the shape behavior of the inclusive and semi - exclusive spectra .     fig.5      fig.6     dot@xmath157 @xmath31 @xmath32 @xcite predicted the possibility of extreme nuclear shrinkage in the @xmath158 system ( strange tribaryon ) by anti - symmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) calculations .",
    "such nuclear contraction is strongly related to the antikaon condensation in compact star @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to evaluate the nuclear contraction in the @xmath0 bound state by the ( @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) reaction . when a harmonic oscillator model is applied to @xmath1he , the r.m.s .",
    "distance of the `` @xmath6 '' pair is 1.90 fm in the @xmath0 bound state , whose value is reduced from that of 2.25 fm in @xmath1he , as discussed in ref .",
    "however , this effect is not expected to be observed because the cross section of the @xmath0 bound state is only slightly suppressed by about 4% .",
    "our simplified calculation in this paper would bring some uncertainties for the resultant spectrum : only the @xmath159 forward scattering has been considered , omitting the @xmath160 charge exchange process which can also contribute to the @xmath0 formation through the coupling between @xmath0 and @xmath161 channels .",
    "this contribution is roughly estimated by replacing the fermi - averaged transition amplitude @xmath162 for the elementary @xmath45 process by the isoscalar transition amplitude @xmath163 which is equivalent to a @xmath164-channel isospin-0 one for ( @xmath2,@xmath165 reactions , including a spectroscopic factor for the @xmath0 @xmath166=1/2 state formed on @xmath1he . as a result ,",
    "the cross section of the @xmath0 bound state is enhanced by about 18 % with fermi - averaging .",
    "it is noticed that the @xmath0 state with @xmath166=1/2 dominates the ( @xmath2,@xmath3 ) reaction at @xmath4= 1.0 gev / c because @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the isovector transition amplitude @xcite .",
    "this nature justifies our assumption that we treat @xmath14_{i=1/2}$ ] as @xmath0 restrictedly in this calculation . in order to get more quantitative results ,",
    "a full coupled - channel calculation would be needed . moreover",
    ", the choice of the parameters in the eikonal distorted waves also changes the absolute value of the cross section , but the distortion effect is not significant for @xmath1he . for the in - flight ( @xmath2,@xmath34 ) reaction",
    ", it would be not appropriate to use the decay rate measured by @xmath2 absorption at rest , considering that its value depends on atomic orbits where @xmath2 is absorbed through atomic cascade processes  @xcite .",
    "more theoretical and experimental considerations are needed .",
    "we have examined the @xmath1he(in - flight @xmath2,@xmath3 ) reaction at @xmath4 = 1.0 gev / c and @xmath169 for the forthcoming j - parc e15 experiment .",
    "we have demonstrated how the spectral shape of the inclusive spectrum is changed by the strength parameters of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the @xmath2-``@xmath6 '' optical potential , and also obtained the semi - exclusive @xmath2 conversion spectrum which has the ability to be compared with the data by the experiment measuring the missing- and invariant - mass simultaneously .",
    "we believe that our considerable assumptions are adequate for the first step toward our purpose . in conclusion ,",
    "the necessary condition to observe a distinct peak of the @xmath0 bound state turns out to be that @xmath7 is deeper than @xmath156 mev and @xmath8 shallower than @xmath156 mev .",
    "the @xmath0 bound state predicted by yamazaki and akaishi @xcite fulfills this condition , while that by shevchenko , gal and mare@xmath17 @xcite stands on the edge of the signal observation in terms of the width . to analyze in detail the forthcoming experimental data at j - parc",
