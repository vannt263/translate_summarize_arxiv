    "the inflationary paradigm has become the widely accepted mechanism responsible for the generation of the primordial density perturbations that seeded the observed large - scale structure ( lss ) of the universe .",
    "an important prediction of the simplest , single field , slow - roll inflationary standard theory is the generation of nearly gaussian distributed primordial density perturbations ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "present cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , e.g. @xcite , and large - scale structure , e.g. , observations have not ruled out this prediction ( in fact they support it ) .",
    "however , in more sophisticated inflationary models , where the conditions of the standard single - field slow - roll inflation fail , a significant and potentially observable deviation from gaussianity may be produced .",
    "extensive work has been developed to try to detect and constraint primordial non - gaussianities ( png ) using a wide range of cosmological probes .",
    "such detection would considerably decrease the number of viable inflationary models and would also provide valuable insights on key physical processes that took place in the early universe .",
    "the three - point statistics of the cmb temperature anisotropies have been the prefered tool to try to constraint the level primordial non - gaussianities . in recent years",
    ", many attempts have been made to motivate and use other cosmological probes for the same purpose .",
    "this includes using statistical properties of large - scale structure , namely the bispectrum and/or trispectrum of galaxy distributions ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and weak - lensing observations ( e.g. @xcite ) , as well as cmb - lss @xcite and cmb-21 cm line @xcite cross - correlations .",
    "the evolution with time of the abundance of both massive collapsed objects , such as galaxy clusters , and large voids has also been presented in the literature as an independent powerful method , to constrain cosmology and in particular non - gaussian models ( see e.g @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the wide diversity of inflationary models available in the literature predict different levels of deviations from gaussian initial conditions in the primordial density spectrum .",
    "depending on the underlying physical mechanism responsible for the generation of non - gaussianities , different triangular configurations ( shapes ) arise .",
    "there are broadly four classes of triangular shapes or , equivalently , four different bispectrum parametrizations : local , equilateral , folded and orthogonal . from these ,",
    "the most studied are primordial non - gaussianities of the local type , which are usually expressed in terms of the gauge - invariant bardeen s potential , written as a taylor expansion around a auxiliary isotropic gaussian random field @xmath9 as ( see e.g. @xcite ) ,    @xmath10    where @xmath11 is a , scale - independent , non - linear parameter that controls the level of deviation from gaussianity .",
    "the tightest constrain to date on the non - linear parameter @xmath11 for this parameterization was achieved by the planck collaboration , by measuring the three - point statistics of the cmb temperature anisotropies , @xmath12 ( and more recently @xmath13 @xcite ) .",
    "this result is consistent with primordial gaussian intial conditions assuming that @xmath11 is a scale independent parameter .",
    "however , if @xmath11 varies with scale one may expect a different level of non - gaussianities on scales smaller than the cmb scales probed by planck .    on galaxy cluster scales ,",
    "primordial non - gaussianities are expected to influence the mass and redshift distribution of cluster abundances . according to @xcite , falling to take in to account",
    "the effect of png on clusters abundaces , can led to biases in the estimation of cosmological parameters when clusters counts are used as cosmological probes .",
    "accurate predictions on how png afects clusters abundances , require detailed knowledge about the underlying mass function of cluster haloes as well as undertanding the way the total cluster mass relates to baryon observables .",
    "the impact of primordial non - gaussianities on the cluster halo mass function has been extensively investigated using a combination of analytical ( see e.g. @xcite ) and numerical n - body ( dark matter only ) simulation ( see e.g. @xcite ) methods .",
    "the study of the effect of png on cluster baryon observables is hard to model analytically .",
    "hydrodynamic n - body simulations ( that model both dark matter and baryons ) are the most appropriate tool to follow the evolution of the complex baryon physics acting on inter - galactic ( igm ) and intra - cluster medium ( icm ) scales during the non - linear evolution of cosmological structure .",
    "a first study of the impact of primordial non - gaussianities on structure formation using hydrodynamic n - body techniques was carried out by @xcite that modeled gas chemistry and a number of other gas physical processes in their simulations to study early gas properties , star formation , metal enrichment and the evolution of stellar populations .",
    "latter , @xcite , also applied hydrodynamic simulations with chemistry and radiative gas physics to study the formation and evolution of galaxies within the png framework .",
    "more recently @xcite carried out png hydrodynamic simulations , including cooling , star formation , stellar evolution and metal pollution from stellar populations , to study the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) signal , due to the inverse compton scattering of cmb photons by ionized gas , in galaxy clusters and filamentary structures    galaxy cluster number counts , e.g. from x - rays or sz cluster surveys , are known to be a most promising method to constrain deviations from primordial gaussianity at cluster scales ( see eg @xcite for several cluster survey forecasts ) .",
    "these estimates critically rely on assumptions about the state of the icm gas atmospheres and on the way their observed properties link with the total cluster mass .",
    "the link is usually expressed via galaxy cluster scaling relations that allow to convert mass function estimates into observed number counts .",
    "these studies often assume hydrostatic equilibrium , spherical symmetry and the self - similar model for clusters @xcite .",
    "more sophisticated approaches rely on galaxy cluster scaling relations derived from hydrodynamic or n - body simulations , calibrated by observations , that do not include primordial non - gaussianities ( see eg @xcite ) .",
    "this procedure is clearly not ideal given that non - gaussianities are known to influence the internal structure of clusters @xcite and therefore they may cause significant changes in the slope and normalization of galaxy cluster scalings .",
    "the study of the impact of png on cluster scaling relations is also essential for an accurate characterization of the physical state of the icm gass and to assess the relative strength of cosmological effects shaping the evolution of galaxy clusters .    in this work ,",
    "we therefore investigate , for the first time , the effect that primordial non - gaussianities have on galaxy clusters scaling relations , using hydrodynamic n - body simulations of large scale structure .",
    "we focus on scalings involving cluster mass , @xmath14 , and gas properties related to the thermodynamical state of the intra - cluster medium .",
    "these are the temperature , @xmath15 , entropy , @xmath16 and the cluster integrated pressure ( thermal energy density ) expressed by the sz @xmath17-compton parameter . throughout the paper , and unless stated otherwise , we adopt a standard flat @xmath18 cosmological model , with a hubble constant , @xmath19 , equal to @xmath20 , with @xmath21 , fractional densities of matter and baryons today of @xmath22 , @xmath23 respectively , a scalar spectral index , @xmath24 , equal to 0.96 , and a power spectrum amplitude @xmath25 , so that @xmath26 .",

    "to determine @xmath88 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90 for each scaling we use the method described in @xcite .",

    "we have also checked that the application of this fitting procedure to individual realization catalogues and to single catalogues that combine clusters from realizations runs of each model lead to equivalent results for the derived scalings .",

    "a common trend in all panels is that @xmath114 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath55 are properties tightly related to the total cluster mass .",
    "this confirms expectations , because temperature is weighted by mass ( not by x - ray emission ) and entropy is computed using @xmath52 which is a better proxy than @xmath56 for the thermodynamic temperature . on the other hand , the cluster integrated sz signal is a measure of the total thermal energy of the object , which is known to be more dependent on the cluster total gravitational mass and gas mass fraction than on the details of gas physical effects acting inside @xmath66 .",

    "+      to study the evolution of the scaling laws we applied the method described in section  [ sec : scal ] to the full set of cluster catalogues in our simulations . as mentioned earlier , we carried out the analysis in two ways .",
    "one applies the method to catalogues from individual realization runs , from which averaged fitting parameters were inferred for each model .",
    "a second approach consisted in combining individual realization catalogues at each redshift and then applying the fitting procedure to the resulting combined catalogues to obtain the scaling parameters .",
    "we verified that both approaches lead to equivalent scaling parameters within the defined range of redshifts , @xmath119 .",
    "the results presented in this paper are from the second approach , which somewhat simplifies the presentation of results and the legibility of plots .    the main result of this section is the set of plots presented in figure  [ fig : scale_evol ] .",

    "fig : scaling - relations ] and bars in data the points are @xmath118 bootstrap resampling errors .    a first conclusion from fig .",
    "[ fig : scale_evol ] is that the power - law index , @xmath120 shows no systematic variation with @xmath98 for all scalings .",
    "in general , data points and errors appear scattered around the redshift zero value , @xmath115 , for each @xmath6 model in all scalings .",
    "we note that although our simulations include only adiabatic gas physics all @xmath89 points ( including those from the gaussean @xmath121 model ) are , in general , below the self - similar predictions : @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "these predictions assume hypothesis such as hydrostatic equilibrium and spherical symmetry in clusters ( as well as a critical density cosmology , @xcite ) which are only approximations to the true state of clusters in simulations @xcite .",
    "deviations from self - similar values are small but in most cases larger than the statistical errors .",
    "the larger deviations are found for the @xmath108 scaling , which presents systematically lower @xmath89 than the @xmath4 scaling .",
    "this is because the sz signal is proportional to the product of the cluster gas temperature by mass ( @xmath122 ) and the temperature scales in our simulations as @xmath123 and @xmath124 ( these values are good approximations for all models ) . in this paper",
    "we will not display further results for the @xmath125 scaling , which has an evolution for the gaussian model consistent with the results in fig .  2 for the @xmath126 simulations in @xcite ( their simulations have a smaller boxsize but the same gas physics and similar cosmology to our g model runs ) .    the scaling - law normalizations , @xmath104 , in fig .",
