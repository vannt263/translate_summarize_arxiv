    "the recent experimental research using slow antiprotons @xmath0 has been in progress . in near future",
    "it will measure the cross sections in the low energy region and will provide a strong challange to theory in order to predict accurate cross sections in the energy range the experiment is concerned .",
    "the collisions of @xmath2 with atomic hydrogen can be considered as a fundamental process and is relevent in many applied areas of physics . for proton impact , the final state can be a superposition of elastic scattering , excitation , ionization and charge exchange .",
    "however , for antiproton impact the charge transfer channel is absent .",
    "inspite of this simplicity , this process needs a careful treatmnent easpecially in the case of slow @xmath2 projectile . in low energy heavy particle collision",
    "it is not easy to single out the dominant channel , because many inelastic channels strongly couple with one another open up , exchanging flux and phase in complicated manner .",
    "thus without inclusion of important channels , an accurate determination of cross sections is not possible . in case of ionization",
    "it is particularly important to describe the continuum part of the wave function with utmost care in order to achieve accurate results .",
    "recently , there have been a large number of studies for @xmath2- h system using various theoretical approachs .",
    "however , most of the close coupling calculations are concentreted on single center expansion method .",
    "it has been realized that accurate cross sections can be calculated if a single - centred basis includes states with high angular momenta . because states associated with high angular momenta are capable of describing the two center nature of the collision processes and is particularly suitable for @xmath2 scattering ( hall 1994 , 1996 , wherman 1996 ) .",
    "however , it has been reported by toshima ( 2001 ) that below 1 kev the one center pseudostate expansion method underestimates the cross sections due to inability to represent the expanding distribution of ionized electrons . for @xmath3 projectile ,",
    "most of the calulations performed are single center close coupling methods , based on semiclassical impact parameter treatment where the scattering wavefunctions are expanded around the target nucleus using suitable bases ( schiwietz 1990 , hall 1996 , igarashi 2000 , azuma 2002 ) .",
    "pons ( 1996 ) proposed a new momocentric close coupling expansion in terms of spherical bessel functions confined in a finite box in the study of @xmath2 - h ionization .",
    "other methods include direct solution of schrodinger equation : wells ( 1996 ) solved the schrodinger equation directly on three dimensional lattice without using expansion of basis set .",
    "similarly tong ( 2001 ) solved the schrodinger equation taking a semiclassical approximation for nuclear motion and the time evolution of electron wave function is propagated by split - operator method with generalized pseudospectral method in the energy representation .",
    "sakimoto ( 2000 ) solved the time dependent schrodinger equation directly using a discrete variable representation technique .",
    "for radial coordinates , he constructed the numerical mesh from generalized laguerre quadrature points .    in this article",
    "we make use of b - spline bases for the construction of scattering wave function .",
    "b - spline has been widely used in atomic physics ( martrin 1999 ) particularly due to its ability to describe the continuum channels more accurately in comparision to other conventional methods ( azuma 2002 ) .",
    "we give particular interest to study the ionization of he@xmath1 under @xmath4 impact .",
    "for the collision of @xmath2 with hydrogenic ions such as he@xmath1,a number of calculations have been performed .",
    "schultz ( 1996a ) used four different methods to calculate the cross sections : very large scale numerical solution of time - dependent schrodinger equation ( tdse ) , hidden crossing theory ( hc ) , classical trajectory monte carlo ( ctmc ) , and continuum distorted eikonal initial state ( cde - eis ) .",
    "tdse calculations which are assumed to be the most accurate in the low energy region are found closer to hc results at low energies .",
    "this calculation also follows ctmc results at intermediate energies and cdw - eis results at high energies .",
    "however , the tdse cross sections are found to be about four times larger than those calculated by janev ( 1995 ) .",
    "a discussion about this disagreements can be seen in the article by krstic ( 1996 ) .",
    "wherman ( 1996 ) used a large single centred hibert basis sets to study the ionization of he@xmath1 by antiproton impact .",
    "they found that their results are in good agreement with tdse results , differeing by 6 - 13 % and the results obtained by janev ( 1995 ) were smaller by a factor of four .",
    "kirchner ( 1999 ) used basis generator method ( bgm ) for @xmath2 - he@xmath1 ionization . in case of @xmath2 - h system ,",
    "there is good convergency of results among various theoretical approaches .",
    "however , the experimental data in the low energy range is awiated . for the case of @xmath2 - he@xmath1 ionization",
    "there is no experimental data available and it is necessary to investigate this system in detail using different approachs and compare the results with other theories .",
    "we study the ionization process of hydrogenic ions under slow @xmath2 projectile impact using single center expansion of scattering wave function in terms of b - spline basis sets .",
    "the detailed description of present theory is presented in section ii .",
    "atomic units ( @xmath5 ) are are used throughout unless otherwise stated .",
    "we use impact parameter approximation where the internuclear motion is treated classically as @xmath6 t , with @xmath7 the impact parameter , @xmath8 the impact velocity and @xmath9 the time and the electronic motion is subjected to quantum mechanical laws .",
    "the electronic motion can be described by the solution of time dependent schrodinger equation @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the position vector of the electron with respect to proton .",
    "the atomic hamiltonian is defined as    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is the nuclear charge of the target and @xmath14 is the time depenent interaction between the projectile and target electron .",
    "the interaction between @xmath2 - hydrogenic ions is given by    @xmath15    the total wave function is expanded as    @xmath16    @xmath17/\\sqrt2(1+\\delta_{m,0}).\\ ] ]    the radial part of the wave function is further expanded as @xmath18 where @xmath19(r ) is the k - th order b - spline functions .",
    "the entire space of the electron sphere is confined with radius @xmath20 .",
    "the interval [ 0 , r@xmath21 is then devided into segments .",
    "the end points of these segments are given by the knot sequence @xmath22 , @xmath23=1,2, .... n+k .",
    "b - splines are piecewise polynomials of order k defined recursively on this knot sequence via the formule :    @xmath24    and    @xmath25    each b - spline is a piecewise polynomial of degree @xmath26 - 1 inside the interval @xmath27 and zero outside the interval.the piecewise nature of b - splines are ideally suited to represent atomic wave functions .",
    "we chose an exponential knot sequence so as to model the exponential behaviour of the wavefunctions .",
    "for the radial function to satisfies the boundary condition that @xmath28 and @xmath29 at @xmath20 , we omit the first and last b - splines respectively . the coefficients @xmath30 of b - spline are determined by diagonilizing the atomic hamiltonian @xmath31 ,    @xmath32    the eigen energies obtained for lowest eight eigen states are found to be closer to the exact ones .    by substituting equation ( 4 ) into the schrodinger equation ( 1 ) we have coupled equations with respect to the expansion coefficients @xmath33 ,    @xmath34<\\phi_{n'l'm'}\\vert{v_{int}}\\vert\\phi_{nlm}>a_{nlm}(t).\\ ] ]    the above coupled equations are solved with the initial condition @xmath35=@xmath36 .",
    "the sum of the probabilities @xmath37 = @xmath38 over eigen states with positive energies gives the ionization probability for a particular impact parameter .",
    "the ionization cross section can be obtained as    @xmath39",
    "we solved the schrodinger equation for @xmath2 colliding with hydrogen and hydrogenic ions .",
    "calculations are performed with 45 radial functions obtained from 8th order b - splines defined in the interval 0 to @xmath40=200 a.u .",
    "the maximum orbital angular momentum @xmath41 used in the calculation is 8 . since a single centred expansion calculation requires the retaintion of much higher values of angular momentum for producing well converged results . by taking all the degeneracies for magnetic quantum number @xmath42",
    ", we solved the coupled differential equation ( 10 ) with 2025(@xmath43 ) number of basis sets .",
    "we integrated equation ( 10 ) in the interval @xmath44 @xmath45 to @xmath46 @xmath5 .",
    "we considered the motion of the projectile along z axis and x - z is the collision plane .",
    "figure 1 dispalys the total cross sections for @xmath2-h ionization . for comparison we also displayed the results obtained from other theoretical approaches .",
    "impact ]    the present calculated ionization cross sections are found to be in good agreement with the results of tong ( 2001 ) throughout the energy range considered .",
    "this calculation has been carried out with straight line trajectory .",
    "it may be mentioned that these authors also performed a calculation using curved trajectory which is not presented here .",
    "the results of one center hilbert space calculation hall are found to be a little higher than the present calculated values in the energy range between 20 - 100 kev impact energies .",
    "however , the once center calculation of igarshi which uses sturmian basis is found to be in resonably good agreement with the present values .",
    "the results of sakimoto ( 2000 ) who used laguerre meshes and the tdse results of wells are a little higher than our calculated values .",
    "wells used a numeriucal solution of three dimensional cartesian co - ordinate grids .",
    "the results of direct solution is always larger than the other calculated values .",
    "they mentioned that consideration of only @xmath47 bound channels is insufficient and the estimated cross sections would overestimate .",
    "the calculation of pons which makes use of the spherical bessel functions to describe continuum channels are consistent with the present calculation .",
    "the recent calculation of azuma who used the b - spline bases similar to the present one is found be in better agreement except around 0.1 kev impact energies . at this incident energy",
    "the present value slightly overestimates the calculation of azuma .     - h collisions , solid line : present results , closed circle : expt.data ( knudsen ( 1995 ) ]    in figure 2 we compare the present calculated results with available experimental measurements of knudsen ( 1995 ) . there is a good agreement between the present results and the experimental data over the whole energy range considered .",
    "it clear from figs .",
    "1 that all the results for total ionization calculated using different approaches show reseonably good agreement in both qualitative and quantitative measures . all the theoretical values including the present one ( fig .",
    "2 ) are in good agreement with the experiment of knudsen",
    ". it will be interesting if the experiment measures the cross section data down to 1 kev energy range .",
    "we hope these will be available soon .     - h collisions as a function of impact parameter @xmath48 at various incident energies ]    in figure 3 we plotted @xmath49 as a function of impact parameter @xmath48 for several incident energies .",
    "it may be observed from the figure that the probability for high impact energy shows long tail and it dissapears as the collision energy decreases .",
    "the paek values also shifts to the lower impact parameter as the collision energy decreases .    in fig .",
    "4 we display the results of our single center b - spline basis set calculation for total ionzation cross section of he@xmath1 by @xmath50 impact for a wide energy range from 1 kev to 500 kev .",
    "( 1s ) , solid line : present results , solid circle : ltdse ( schultz 1997 ) , dashed line : sce ( ford a l , private communication ) , long dashed line : bgm ( kirchner 1999 ) ]    for comparasion we also show in the figure , the results obtained by lattice schrodinger - equation approach ( ltdse ) ( schultz 1997 ) and single center results ( ford ( private communication ) , wherman ( 1996 ) and references therein ) . also included in the figure are the results of kirchner who used basis generator method ( bgm ) .",
    "this method deals with the construction of a basis that dynamically adapts to the collision process considered in order to follow the propagation and to cover the one dimensional subspace defined by the solution of the time dependent schrodinger equation(tdse ) .",
    "it may be seen in the figure that the present results are found to be in good agreement with the calculation of ford who employed a single centred hilbert basis set .",
    "however , both ltdse and bgm results slightly overestimate the present cross sections .",
    "it has been mentioned in the paper of schultz that this overestimation in comparision to the results of ford is about 10% .",
    "they reported that this may due to the fact that it is likely that the excitation of he@xmath1 to higher @xmath51 values probably @xmath52 , which has been incorrectly treated as ionization in ltdse grid .",
    "they finally concluded that the treatment of excitation to @xmath52 would be important in their method .",
    "additionally other factors such as grid spacing would also needs to be carefully examined in order to calculate the ionization result beyond an accuracy of 10%",
    ".     - he@xmath1(1s ) collisions as a function of impact parameter @xmath48 at various incident energies ]    to support the present calculation , we displayed in fig .",
    "5 the variation of ionization probability with the impact parameter for various collision energies .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath53 as function of @xmath48 shows long tail for higher impact energies which is well experienced in case of 500 kev impact energies .",
    "however , for all collision energies peaks around b = 0.3 @xmath5 are observed .",
    "we also derived the dynamic ionization probability at this impact parameter ( 0.3 @xmath5 ) when the two nuclei are separated from each other at some distance .",
    "- he@xmath1(1s ) ionization at various incident energies for a particular impact parameter @xmath48 = 0.3 a.u . ]    this is shown in fig .",
    "it is clear from the figure that the ionization probabilities saturate around @xmath54 = 10 @xmath5 for all impact energies except 500 kev where the saturation starts early around @xmath55 .",
    "the probability shows a rapid growth between -3 and 3 @xmath5 and then saturatation starts .",
    "therefore we allowed sufficient time for the probability to become completely stable .",
    "the same type of situation has been shown by tong ( 2001 ) who used curved trajectory for @xmath56 - h ionization .",
    "they have reported that for high collision energies ( above 1 kev ) the probability saturates z(vt ) above 10 @xmath5 with a rapid increase from z(vt ) = -5 @xmath5 . for collision velocities ( below 1 kev )",
    ", they found a slow increase of the probability .",
    "this time delay can be termed as post - collisional interaction .",
    "pons ( 2000 ) indicated that that due to slow antiproton motion the projectile pushes away the ejected electron even when the prjectile is going farther from the target .",
    "afterall in the present case fig .",
    "5 helps for a convergence check",
    ".    it may be worth to mention that in the case of @xmath2 - h ionization , where in the limit of small internuclear distance , the electron experiences a dipole like potential bound by two nuclei ( krstic 1996 ) and there exists a critical value of the dipole stength below which no bound state can be supported .",
    "it corresponds to the internuclear distance known as fermi - teller radius ( fermi and teller 1947 ) at which the eigen energies of the ground state merge with the continuum .",
    "however , in case of an asymmetric dipole as in @xmath2 - he@xmath1 case , krstic reported that the electronic eigen states donot merge with the continuum and hence the ionization cross sections are expected to show an exponential decrease for small collision velocities .",
    "these situations are clearly evient in fig . 1 and fig",
    "the results obtained for @xmath2 - h are found to be in good agreement with the other calculated values as well as the available experimental data .",
    "however , the experimental results are still awaited in low energy range . for the case of he@xmath1 target ,",
    "all the theoretical calculations includding the present one show good agreement within a few percent of accuracy . specifically the present results and the results of ford show a good convergency .",
    "our b - spline basis results confirms the single center hilbert space calculation of ford .",
    "there is no measured values for this system",
    ". it would be interesting to have more calculations for slow @xmath2 projctile collisiding with he@xmath1 .",
