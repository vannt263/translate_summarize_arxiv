    "absolute spectrophotometry on large angular scales in the far - infrared ( @xmath2 m ) and submillimeter ( @xmath3 mm ) bands is not possible using ground - based instruments , because of the large , time - varying attenuation by the earth s atmosphere . even using balloon - based instruments , observations",
    "require frequent chopping to ` blank ' regions , so that the accurate photometry is available only on scales comparable to the reference beam separation .",
    "portions of the galactic plane were surveyed by balloon instruments in wavebands between 150 and 300@xmath4 m , revealing the bright ridge of dust emission from h  ii regions and molecular and atomic clouds centered on the galactic plane ( cf .",
    "hauser 1984 and references therein ) .",
    "the infrared astronomical satellite ( iras ) made the first all - sky survey at 100@xmath4 m wavelength ( neugebauer 1984 ) .",
    "the 100@xmath4 m emission at high galactic latitude is strongly correlated to the distribution of atomic gas as traced by the 21-cm line of h  i ( boulanger & perault 1987 ) , and can be explained by emission from dust grains , mixed with the interstellar gas and heated by the interstellar radiation field ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "interstellar grains of various sizes contribute different parts of the infrared emission .",
    "in one recent model , the emission is broken into three components , due to ` big ' grains , ` very small ' grains , and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( dsert , boulanger , & puget 1990 ) . the far - infrared emission is dominated by ` big ' grains , which also dominate the mass and total luminosity of interstellar dust .    in this paper",
    "we describe all - sky observations by the far infrared absolute spectrophotometer ( firas ) aboard the cosmic background explorer ( ) , which provide the first complete coverage of the wavelength range from 4.5 mm through 104@xmath4 m .",
    "preliminary results on the galactic continuum and spectral lines in this wavelength range were presented by wright ( 1991 ) , and the angular variation of the brightnesses of the spectral lines was presented by bennett ( 1994 ) . here",
    "we focus on the galactic continuum spectrum and its variation both in the galactic plane and at high galactic latitude .",
    "the firas is one of the three cosmic background explorer ( ) instruments . during its observing lifetime ( november 1989 to september 1990 ) ,",
    "95% of the sky was covered by scans at a solar elongation of 9194@xmath5 .",
    "the effective beam has a fwhm of @xmath6 and drops sharply to -30 db by @xmath7 off - axis , as confirmed by observations of the moon .",
    "the spectrometer is a michelson interferometer with bolometric detectors sensitive to 196 @xmath0 radiation .",
    "( throughout this paper , we use the @xmath0 scale for frequencies , @xmath8 . to convert to ghz , multiply by 30 ; to convert to wavelength in @xmath4 m ,",
    "use @xmath9 . )",
    "the incoming photons are separated into high- and low - frequency channels by a dichroic filter .",
    "the spectrometer was operated in several modes by varying the stroke length and scan rate . for this paper",
    "the data from the low and high frequency detectors were combined , so that the spectra cover frequencies 2.296 @xmath0 ( or wavelengths 4.5mm104@xmath4 m ) , with a spectral resolution of 0.57 @xmath0 over the entire range .",
    "( see fixsen 1994 for technical details ) .",
    "the observations were absolutely calibrated by placing a beam - filling blackbody in the aperture during calibration periods ( once per month during most of the mission ) .",
    "relative calibration was maintained by always measuring the difference between the sky signal and that of an internal calibrator .",
    "the monopole and dipole components of the cosmic background radiation were removed from each spectrum by subtracting a blackbody with a temperature @xmath10 , where @xmath11  k , @xmath12  mk ( mather 1993 ) , and @xmath13 is the angle between the line of sight and the orientation of the cosmic dipole @xmath14 ( kogut 1993 ) .",
    "the resulting spectra are dominated by the continuum emission of galactic dust , spectral lines of galactic gas , the ( as - yet undetected ) cosmic infrared background , and contributions from the zodiacal light at high frequencies and galactic synchrotron and free - free emission at very low frequencies .",
    "the zodiacal light was modeled using observations by the  diffuse infrared background experiment ( dirbe ) .",
    "the dirbe observations at 5 wavelengths between 4.9 and 100@xmath4 m were used to fit a parameterized model of the distribution and temperature of interplanetary dust .",
    "the solar elongation of the dirbe line of sight varied from @xmath15 to @xmath16 during each spin about the  rotation axis , introducing a strong time dependence to the sky brightness .",
    "the parameterized model was optimized to match the temporal variation of the sky brightness ; therefore , no assumptions were made about the time - invariant sky brightness outside the solar system .",
    "the parameterized zodiacal light model was evaluated for each firas line of sight , and for a frequency of 70 @xmath0 , to produce a spatial template , @xmath17 .",
    "this spatial template was then used to determine the zodiacal light spectrum , by assuming the brightness can be decomposed into cosmic , galactic , and zodiacal components : @xmath18 where the cosmic microwave background is assumed to be the only isotropic background .",
    "the decomposition of the firas spectrum for the region @xmath19 is shown in figure  [ figcgz ] .",
    "this technique is similar to that used by wright ( 1991 ) to determine the spectrum of the galaxy , @xmath20 ; for this paper , we excluded the galactic plane ( @xmath21 ) and added the zodiacal term .",
    "the resulting zodiacal light spectrum is adequately represented by a power - law , @xmath22 , over the firas bandpass .",
    "we removed the zodiacal light from each firas spectrum by subtracting @xmath23 .",
    "if the zodiacal spatial template is accurate to better than 10% , then the zodiacal light subtraction introduces negligible uncertainty except at the very highest frequencies and at the galactic pole . at high galactic latitude ( @xmath24 )",
    ", the zodiacal light contributes 60% of the total emission at 100 @xmath0 , 25% at 70 @xmath0 , and 10% at 42 @xmath0 .",
    "the contributions of galactic synchrotron and free - free emission to the firas frequencies were constrained using observations by the  differential microwave radiometer ( dmr ) .",
    "the dmr observations at three frequencies , 31 , 53 , & 90 ghz ( 1.0 , 1.8 , & 3.0 @xmath0 ) , were extrapolated to higher frequencies assuming the spectrum follows a power - law , @xmath25 . for synchrotron emission ,",
    "the spectrum follows @xmath26 at lower frequency ( cf .",
    "de bernardis , masi , & vittorio 1991 ) , and then the spectral index steepens to @xmath27 above 10 ghz ( banday & wolfendale 1991 ) . for free - free emission ,",
    "the spectral index is @xmath28 . in order to place an upper limit to the free - free and synchrotron emission at higher frequencies",
    ", we used the shallower @xmath28 to scale the total brightness at 53 ghz .",
    "this is very conservative , because a substantial fraction of the 53 ghz emission is due to synchrotron and dust emission .",
    "a cosecant of galactic latitude was fitted to the 53 ghz map , and an isotropic component with a brightness equal to the cosecant slope ( 12@xmath4k ) was added to the map to replace the isotropic component ( cf . bennett 1992 ) .",
    "the combined synchrotron and free - free emission account for @xmath29% of the emission at frequencies higher than 5 @xmath0 . in",
    "what follows , we excluded frequencies below 5 @xmath0 in order to avoid any possibility of contamination by free - free emission .",
    "there were 9 spectral lines detected by firas in the average spectrum of the galaxy ( wright 1991 , bennett 1994 ) , and several of these are evident in each spectrum at low galactic latitude .",
    "these lines were avoided for the purposes of this paper by eliminating the appropriate frequencies .",
    "all of the lines are unresolved , so only two frequency bins contain each line emission ; however , some ringing in the apodization function was evident for the very bright lines .",
    "we removed spectral frequencies within 1.5 @xmath0 of the bright c  ii ( 63.395 @xmath0 ) and n  ii ( 48.72 and 82.04 @xmath0 ) lines , and within 1 @xmath0 of the c  i ( 16.419 and 27.00 @xmath0 ) and co ( 7.681 , 11.531 , 15.375 , and 19.237 @xmath0 ) lines .",
    "coaddition was necessary in order to accurately measure the galactic spectrum at high latitudes .",
    "the spectra were combined into 120 longitude bins in the galactic plane and 26 high - latitude regions .",
    "the bins were chosen to be larger at higher latitude , where the signal is relatively weak .",
    "for the galactic plane spectra , the bins are evenly spaced bins at 3@xmath5 longitude intervals and include data with @xmath30 .",
    "the high latitude bins consist of the north and south galactic polar caps , with @xmath24 , high - latitude zones with @xmath31 in 90@xmath5-wide longitude bins , and intermediate - latitude zones with @xmath32 in @xmath33-wide longitude bins .",
    "two sample spectra , toward ( @xmath34 ) and @xmath35 ) are shown in figures  [ fitfig](a ) and  [ fitfigh](a ) .",
    "the error bars shown here and used in the spectral analysis are the calibration uncertainties in the mean brightness over each spatial region , and they do not reflect the intrinsic variation of the brightness within the region .      the spectrum for each region was fitted by one or more modified blackbodies of the form @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the optical depth at @xmath38  @xmath0 ( @xmath39 m ) , and @xmath40 is the emissivity normalized to unity at @xmath41 .",
    "the simplest fit for each spectrum was a single component with a power - law emissivity , @xmath42 . in the low - frequency limit",
    ", the kramers - kronig theorem can be used to show that @xmath43 is an even positive integer ( wright 1993 ) , although it is not yet known below which frequency this limit applies .",
    "the simplest fit we considered was for a @xmath1 emissivity , so that there are only 2 free parameters ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "as examples , the residual spectra following two such fits are shown in figures  [ fitfig](b ) and  [ fitfigh](b ) .",
    "the residuals clearly indicate the presence of excess emission at low frequencies in nearly all of the spectra , indicating a very cold emission component that is widespread .",
    "we repeated the spectral fits allowing @xmath43 to vary , which substantially improved the @xmath46 of most fits .",
    "examples of the residuals that resulted in this case are shown in figures  [ fitfig](c ) and  [ fitfigh](c ) .    in the inner galaxy , where the signal to noise is high ,",
    "poor fits were obtained with a power - law emissivity .",
    "the galactic center spectrum at frequencies below 50 @xmath0 is best fit by @xmath47 , and the other spectra require lower @xmath43 .",
    "there are good reasons to expect that the value of @xmath43 derived from fits using single temperatures is lower than the true value : the distribution of temperatures along the line of sight should broaden the spectrum , and lower our derived @xmath43 .",
    "the highest observed value of @xmath43 is most likely to approach the true value , and we will therefore adopt @xmath48 at low frequencies . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the emissivity increases less steeply than @xmath1 .",
    "a broken power - law model that can match the emissivity rolloff at high frequencies has @xmath49 for frequencies above 70 @xmath0 ; however , the broken power - law introduces an unobserved cusp so that @xmath46 is large for these fits . a smooth model for the emissivity variation that can match the high - frequency rolloff and improve the @xmath46 of the fits is @xmath50^\\frac{1}{\\beta } } } , \\label{emiss}\\ ] ] with @xmath51 @xmath0 and @xmath52 .",
    "these values of @xmath53 and the exponents in equation  [ emiss ] were chosen by experiment , and are not the result of a formal fit ; they improve @xmath46 for the @xmath54 fit by a factor of 2 .",
    "the high - frequency rolloff is needed only in the inner galaxy , but is not excluded in the high - latitude spectra , where the signal - to - noise is low . at high latitude ,",
    "a simple power - law ( @xmath1 ) is adequate .",
    "it can not be determined with the present data whether the high - frequency rolloff in the emissivity is due to different grain properties in the inner galaxy , or the distribution of grain temperatures along the line of sight . in",
    "what follows , we use equation  [ emiss ] for the galactic plane and a simple @xmath1 for the high - latitude spectra .",
    "the firas spectra of galactic emission can be characterized by three components , which we call ` warm ' ( @xmath55  k ) , ` cold ' ( @xmath56  k ) , and ` intermediate ' ( @xmath57  k ) .",
    "there is no overlap between the temperatures of the three components , and the ranges are those of the fit results .",
    "each spectrum was fitted by a single - component , @xmath48 model ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 varying ) ; a single - component , free @xmath43 ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath43 varying ) ; and a two - component , @xmath48 model ( @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 varying ) , with the goal of finding the simplest model that could fit the most spectra .",
    "the significance of a given model was judged by its improvement in the reduced @xmath46 , according to the f - test .",
    "the probability that the improvement in @xmath46 due to including an extra parameter was _ not _ due to chance , @xmath62 , was calculated . in every case ,",
    "the single - component , free-@xmath43 model and the two - component models were significantly better than the single - component , @xmath48 model , and in most cases , the two - component model was significantly better than either single - component model . in table",
    "[ planetab ] , the results of the two - component model for the galactic plane spectra are listed , together with the probability , @xmath63 , that the two - component model is significantly better than the single - component , @xmath48 model , and the probability , @xmath64 , that the two - component model is significantly better than the single - component , free @xmath43 model . for some spectra , it was not possible to distinguish between the single - component , free @xmath43 and two - component models at the 90% confidence level . in the inner galaxy ,",
    "both the one- and two - component fits are poor because of the intermediate - temperature emission .",
    "a three - component fit improves @xmath46 in the inner galaxy , but can not be fitted to the outer galaxy or high - latitude spectra because the third component can not be separated from the other two .",
    "we therefore consider the two - component model for the analysis of the galactic plane spectra .",
    "the results of some of the high - latitude fits are shown in tables  [ highlattab]a , b , and c for the various spectral models .",
    "the excess submillimeter emission above a @xmath1 modified blackbody is present with @xmath65% confidence in all spectra .",
    "the distinction between the single - component , free @xmath43 model and the two - component model was not possible for many high - latitude spectra .",
    "the results of the free-@xmath43 fit indicate statistically significant variations in @xmath43 , so that the emissivity law varies substantially from place to place .",
    "based on the fact that the two - component model was more successful in the galactic plane , it is likely that the modest amount of cold emission , even at @xmath24 , is also due to a second component .",
    "the cosmic infrared background radiation ( cibr ) was assumed to be small in this analysis , although the observational upper limits to its brightness still allow it to contribute a significant fraction of the sky brightness .",
    "models of the integrated light of galaxies ( franceschini 1994 ) predict cibr brightnesses that are 525% of the 10 - 100 @xmath0 sky brightness ( after zodiacal light subtraction ) at the galactic poles . in order to determine whether the presence of a cibr would have a significant effect on our conclusions",
    ", we subtracted the brightest cibr from franceschini ( 1994 ) from the firas spectra and repeated the spectral fits .",
    "the optical depths decreased , as expected because the sky is fainter , but the temperatures of the warm and very cold components are not significantly affected .",
    "we therefore feel confident in neglecting the cibr , noting only that the dust optical depth at the highest latitudes is overestimated .",
    "two effects will produce a range of temperatures in each spectrum .",
    "first , each particle size has its own temperature , determined by the balance between its far - infrared and visible absorption efficiencies .",
    "second , different regions of the galaxy have different radiation fields , which heat the dust to different temperatures .",
    "the issue of disentangling these effects is beyond our present scope .",
    "the radial variation of the interstellar radiation field can best be determined by comparison to spectral - line surveys of co and h  i , for which the distances can be determined from galactic rotation . in order to gain some insight into the effect of a temperature distribution",
    ", we examined the following spectral model : @xmath66 which assumes equal probabilities for grains at each temperature in the range @xmath67 .",
    "there is a strong covariance between @xmath44 and @xmath68 , such that opening the width of the temperature distribution leads to lower mean temperatures .",
    "we have fitted eq .",
    "[ eqdis ] to representative firas spectra for the inner galaxy , outer galaxy , and the high - latitude sky . for the inner galaxy ,",
    "the optimum width to the temperature distribution was @xmath69 .",
    "the fact that eq .  [ eqdis ] does not improve the fits , despite adding an extra degree of freedom , leads us to conclude that either the temperature distribution is not important , or it has a substantially different functional form than we considered .",
    "for the outer galaxy , eq .",
    "[ eqdis ] produced fits of comparable quality ( @xmath46 ) for a wide range of @xmath68 , as long as the maximum temperature , @xmath70  k. thus it is possible that comparable column densities of dust exist at a wide range of temperatures in the outer galaxy .",
    "the power emitted depends approximately on the 56@xmath71 power of temperature , so negligible amounts of power are emitted by dust much cooler than that at the highest temperatures . at high latitudes , eq .",
    "eqdis was no better than a single temperature .",
    "it is worth noting that changing @xmath68 has only a small effect on the shape of the spectrum at low frequencies . thus using a single temperature , rather than a continuous distribution , for the warm dust emission",
    "has no impact on the presence of the ` very cold ' component in the spectra .",
    "the small width of the temperature distribution for the inner galaxy has direct implications for the variation of temperature with galactocentric radius and particle size .",
    "an upper limit to the width of the temperature distribution for the line of sight in the galactic plane toward @xmath72 is @xmath73  k at the 95% confidence level .",
    "the expected @xmath68 due to galactic radial variations may be estimated by assuming the volume emissivity scales exponentially with scale length @xmath74 , and and the radiation field has scale length @xmath75 ; then @xmath76 . if @xmath77  kpc , @xmath78  kpc , and @xmath79  k , then @xmath80  k , comparable to our upper limit to @xmath68 .",
    "the expected @xmath68 due to the range of particle sizes may be estimated as the rms dispersion in @xmath44 weighted by the emissivity per particle size ; we find @xmath81  k from this effect .",
    "thus the bulk of the far - infrared emission is fit well by a narrow temperature range , and the expected temperature range due to the galactic radial gradient and the size distribution is comparable to the upper limit derived from the data .",
    "this justifies the assumption of a single temperature along the line of sight as a first approximation .",
    "the longitude profiles of the optical depths and temperatures of the warm and cold emission are shown in figure  [ ttaufig ] .",
    "it is evident that the temperature of the warm component varies strongly with galactic longitude .",
    "this variation is expected because lines of sight passing closer to the galactic center sample dust subjected to a higher radiation field ( mathis , mezger , & panagia 1983 ) .",
    "the temperature of the cold component does not show the same longitude variation ; if anything , the temperature of the cold component may be lower in the inner galaxy .",
    "the high - latitude variations of the temperature and optical depth of the ` warm ' and ` cold ' components are shown schematically in figure  [ mapparfig ] . in the @xmath82 zone",
    ", the temperature of the warm component generally follows that in the galactic plane , with clear exceptions being the relatively hot orion starforming region at @xmath83 and the relatively cold taurus dark cloud region at @xmath84 .",
    "note that the optical depth is high in both the orion and taurus regions , demonstrating that the temperature and optical depth vary independently and can be separately determined .",
    "the orion region contains a large ob association , and has a radiation field enhanced by a factor of @xmath85 with respect to the general interstellar radiation field , when averaged over scales comparable to the firas beam ( wall 1994 ) .",
    "the taurus region has relatively few ob stars , and its infrared emission is dominated by relatively dense , cold molecular clouds . at higher latitudes ,",
    "the temperature approaches the polar value of around 18  k , with both poles comparable .",
    "the optical depths of the warm and cold components are well correlated . in figure  [ tautaufig ] , they are plotted against each other .",
    "the rank correlation coefficient between @xmath59 and @xmath61 is 0.96 for all spectra , and it is 0.95 for the high - latitude spectra only .",
    "the correlation is not quite linear , with the average @xmath86 for high latitudes ( low optical depths ) and @xmath87 for low latitudes ( high optical depths ) .",
    "it is remarkable that the cold and warm components are so well correlated , and that nearly the same ratio of optical depths is obtained for all lines of sight .",
    "however , it is also significant that the correlation is not perfect , so there is not a single , universal type of dust .",
    "the distinction between the warm and very cold components was made possible by the continuous spectral coverage of firas , extending throughout the far - infrared and submillimeter bands .",
    "observations in the 100350@xmath4 m range are consistent with dust at a single temperature  the warm dust .",
    "the warm dust temperatures we measure in the galactic plane are similar to those obtained from balloon - based surveys ( cf .",
    "hauser 1984 ) , and the high - latitude dust temperature we measure is similar to that ( @xmath88 k ) obtained from broadband ( 134 , 154 , & 186@xmath4 m ) observations by a berkeley / nagoya rocket experiment ( kawada 1994 ) .",
    "the very cold emission has been detected before , and ascribed either to a submillimeter excess or to an emissivity index @xmath89 . combining broad - band observations at 5.6 , 8.7 , 15.8 , and 22.5 @xmath0 ( 1800 , 1100 , 630 , and 440 @xmath4 m ) by a mit balloon - borne instrument (",
    "page , cheng , & meyer 1990 ) with observations at 33 , 40 , and 67 @xmath0 ( 300 , 250 , and 150 @xmath4 m ) by a goddard balloon - borne instrument ( hauser 1984 ) and observations at 100 and 167 @xmath0 ( 100 and 60 @xmath4 m ) by iras , the spectrum of the galactic plane at @xmath90 was found to have a submillimeter excess ( page 1990 ) .",
    "the excess could be characterized by a temperature of 4  k and optical depth @xmath91 at 30 @xmath0 .",
    "we have compared their observations to the firas spectrum at the same location .",
    "the excess submillimeter emission from the mit / goddard spectrum is larger than that seen by firas , but the results are consistent to within the uncertainties due to different beam sizes and calibration .",
    "similarly , combining broad - band observations at 6 , 9 , and 12 @xmath0 ( 1700 , 1100 , 830 @xmath4 m ) by a santa barbara / berkeley balloon experiment ( meinhold 1993 ) with iras 100@xmath4 m observations , the best - fitting single - component model for the dust emission required @xmath92 for lines of sight near the star @xmath4 peg ( @xmath93 ) .",
    "a low value of @xmath43 indicates excess emission with respect to the @xmath1 emissivity expected at low frequencies , and therefore the santa barbara / berkeley results provide more observational evidence for the very cold component in the spectrum of interstellar dust at high galactic latitude .",
    "the temperature of the warm component of the firas spectra agrees with predictions for dust with a size distribution consistent with interstellar extinction ( mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 ) and heated by the interstellar radiation field ( mathis , mezger , & panagia 1983 ; draine & anderson 1985 ) .",
    "they are also similar to those derived from broadband 60100  @xmath4 m observations by iras ( sodroski 1987 ; bloeman , deul , & thaddeus 1990 ) .",
    "however , the temperatures inferred from the 60100  @xmath4 m ratios do not show the longitude variation expected for dust heated by a radiation field that increases toward the galactic center .",
    "this mystery , which has posed problems for models of the physical properties of the dust grains responsible for the emission ( dsert , boulanger , & puget 1990 ) , is resolved now that all - sky surveys at longer wavelengths are available .",
    "the dirbe broadband 140/240  @xmath4 m temperature ( sodroski 1994 ) shows the same longitude variation evident in figure  [ ttaufig ] .",
    "the firas observations demonstrate that the spectrum of interstellar dust emission in the 100300  @xmath4 m range is due to emission from grains with nearly a single average temperature . the excess mid - infrared emission , which dominates shortward of 40  @xmath4 m and contributes strongly at 60  @xmath4 m , is evidently due to particles undergoing temperature fluctuations ( draine & anderson 1985 ; dsert 1990 ) .",
    "the fact that the interstellar dust spectrum between 100300  @xmath4 m can be fitted by a single modified blackbody suggests that it is produced by large grains in equilibrium with the interstellar radiation field .",
    "thus observations longward of 100  @xmath4 m can be reliably used to infer the optical depth of interstellar dust .",
    "the narrow temperature range also suggests that the emission is not produced by multiple grain types with widely different temperatures .",
    "for example , a model with bare graphite and silicate grains ( _ e.g. _ draine & lee 1984 ) predicts two distinct grain temperatures . for particles with equal radii of 0.1 @xmath4 m , graphite and silicate grains",
    "are predicted to have temperatures of 18.8  k and 15.4  k , respectively .",
    "taking into account the predicted abundance and absorption efficiency , the graphite grains produce about 6075 % of the far - infrared emission .",
    "a two - composition model with the above mixture is a significantly worse fit to the far - infrared spectrum observed by firas than a single component with free temperature .",
    "further work is needed to determine the appropriate temperature distribution of the grains . at this stage",
    "we can state that the firas observations require that the range of temperatures that contribute to the far - infrared emission is very narrow , and does not allow distinct compositional components with comparable abundances .",
    "the emission that we have characterized as a modified blackbody is a new component of the interstellar spectrum .",
    "it would have been difficult to detect without the continuous spectral coverage of firas , and it only becomes important at frequencies below 15 @xmath0 ; see figure  [ figcomp ] . in the first paper",
    "presenting firas observations of the galaxy , wright found that the very cold emission was correlated with a galactic angular template based on the total intensity in the firas spectra ( over the cosmic background radiation ) .",
    "the very cold component was also found in the firas data by barnes ( 1994 ) , who used a principal component analysis to separate the firas data into ` eigenspectra ' and ` eigenmaps ' .",
    "we have now determined the angular distribution of the very cold component by modelling coadded spectra regions at high and low latitude .",
    "the salient results for constraining the nature of the very cold component are the following : ( 1 ) the temperature of the very cold component varies little with galactic longitude , and is not correlated with the temperature of the warm dust .",
    "( 2 ) the very cold component is ubiquitous , and its optical depth is correlated ( though not directly proportional to ) the optical depth of the warm dust emission .",
    "we consider now some hypotheses for the nature of the very cold component .",
    "a straightforward hypothesis for the origin of the very cold component is dust heated by an attenuated radiation field .",
    "for example , dust inside molecular clouds with extinction @xmath94 is cooler because it is protected from ultraviolet photons . in order to explain the low temperature of the very cold component",
    ", the heating rate must be attenuated by a factor @xmath95 .",
    "calculations of the penetration of the interstellar radiation field into molecular clouds indicate that the heating rate is attenuated by a factor of @xmath96 at the center of a cloud with extinction @xmath97 for silicate grains and @xmath98 for graphite grains ( mathis 1983 , hereafter mmp ) .",
    "similar results are obtained by somewhat more detailed models that take into account the self - heating of the cloud by infrared emission from the outer layers ( bernard 1992 ) .",
    "the corresponding column density of gas is @xmath99",
    "@xmath100 ( bohlin , savage , & drake 1978 ) . by the standards of the diffuse interstellar medium , this is a large column density , so clouds containing shielded dust should be well known .",
    "we note that a much lower estimate for the column density needed to shield dust to temperatures corresponding to the very cold component was obtained by barnes ( 1994 ) , who concluded that the very cold component could be explained by dust shielded by the outer layers of molecular clouds with @xmath101  mag .",
    "barnes scaled the intensity of starlight in clouds by the exponential factor , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is the far - ultraviolet optical depth .",
    "this estimate neglects the ability of visible photons , which contain more than half of the energy density of the interstellar radiation field , to penetrate much deeper than uv photons ( cf .",
    "mathis 1981 ) .",
    "further , scattering allows even ultraviolet radiation to penetrate much deeper than the exponential factor predicts ; for example , starlight in the center of a cloud with total extinction @xmath104 is predicted to be @xmath105 times brighter when scattering ( with @xmath106 ) is included ( flannery , roberge , & rybicki 1980 ) .",
    "very large column densities are needed to shield dust from the interstellar radiation field .",
    "the very cold component is observed to be ubiquitous ; in particular , it is present in the high - latitude spectra . in order for shielded dust to explain the very cold component",
    ", there must be clouds with high extinction distributed throughout the sky",
    ". this possibility can be excluded , and we can show that their filling factor must be small on angular scales down to @xmath107 . because we can see external galaxies , it is clear that dark clouds can not fill much of the sky on scales larger of a few degrees .",
    "the shane & wirtanen ( 1967 ) galaxy counts within 1 deg@xmath108 bins are relatively smooth , and are anticorrelated with the 21-cm line brightness ( heiles 1976 ) .",
    "the bin - to - bin dispersion in the galaxy counts ( @xmath109% at @xmath110 ) is due primarily to the ` intrinsic mottling in the surface density of the distribution of galaxies ' ( burstein & heiles 1978 ) .",
    "thus on very large scales , there is no evidence for optically thick clouds that could shield dust from the interstellar radiation field .    on intermediate scales , regions containing shielded dust",
    "should be observable as dark clouds against background starlight .",
    "the palomar observatory sky survey has been surveyed for all regions of noticeable extinction ( lynds 1962 ; magnani , blitz , & mundy 1985 ) , and the regions of high - latitude extinction were found to be molecular clouds traced by co rotational lines",
    ". however , the total extinctions of these clouds are generally small ( @xmath111 for individual clouds ; de vries & magnani 1986 ) .",
    "further , the covering fraction of the co - emitting portion of high - latitude molecular clouds is small ( @xmath112 ; magnani , lada , & blitz 1986 ; but see also heithausen 1993 ) so that their column density averaged over large regions is only of order @xmath113  @xmath100 .",
    "we may relate our derived optical depths at @xmath38  @xmath0 ( @xmath114 m ) to column densities using @xmath115 ( based on 250@xmath4 m observations ; hildebrand 1983 ) .",
    "the observed optical depth of the cold component at @xmath116 corresponds to a column density of @xmath117  @xmath100 .",
    "this is some two orders of magnitude greater than the amount of molecular gas at high latitudes .    on angular scales down to the @xmath107 resolution of the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ 100@xmath4 m sky survey",
    ", regions of shielded dust should be bright infrared emitters .",
    "shielded regions must reemit all of the energy absorbed from the interstellar radiation field ; for almost any solid material , this emission occurs at mid- to far - infrared wavelengths .",
    "the surface brightness of the optically thick regions , integrated over infrared wavelengths , must equal the surface brightness of the interstellar radiation field ( cf .",
    "keene 1981 ; mmp ) .",
    "the power in the very cold emission is observed to be negligible , so the energy would be emitted by the warm component .",
    "the range of temperatures observed for the warm component is not large , so the surface brightness is traced ( within a factor of 2 ) by the 100@xmath4 m emission .",
    "the surface brightness of the isrf is @xmath118 erg @xmath100 s@xmath119 ( mmp ) , which corresponds to a specific surface brightness at 100@xmath4 m for @xmath120  k and @xmath48 of @xmath121 mjy sr@xmath119 .",
    "it is straightforward to see all regions with @xmath122  mjy  sr@xmath119 on the iras sky maps .",
    "the bright iras - detected clouds correspond to known dark clouds and high - latitude molecular clouds , with some exceptions ( cf .",
    "blitz , bazell , & dsert 1990 ) . as discussed above",
    ", the amount of material in high - latitude molecular clouds is far too low to explain the observed brightness of the very cold component of the firas spectra .    on small angular scales",
    ", the shielded regions would be visible as extinction on high - resolution optical images and would be point sources to iras .",
    "optical images of high - latitude clouds reveal small - scale structure that does not always correlate with the infrared emission ( paley 1991 , guhathakurta 1994 ) .",
    "the fact that these regions are seen as _ bright _ on optical images suggests that the light is a combination of scattered starlight and luminescence .",
    "the lack of a 100@xmath4 m counterpart precludes these regions being optically thick to the isrf , so we agree with previous suggestions that the anomalous optical brightness is due either to an admixture of large grains or to radiative transfer ( _ e.g. _ shadowing ) effects . the existence of small , shielded regions can be ruled out on thermodynamical grounds .",
    "such small , shielded regions would have substantial overpressure and would rapidly evaporate without a massive central object to hold them together : the pressure of shielded regions smaller than @xmath107 within 100 pc is at least two orders of magnitude larger than the pressure in the diffuse ism ( cf .",
    "reach , heiles , & koo 1993 ) .",
    "very small grains ( @xmath123 m ) undergo temperature fluctuations when exposed to an ultraviolet radiation field , because the mean interval between successive ultraviolet photons is longer than the cooling time . immediately after an ultraviolet photon is absorbed , very small grains cool by radiating at frequencies far higher than the larger grains . in the time interval between ultraviolet photon impacts , the temperature of",
    "the particle is very low , but at least the cosmic microwave background temperature ( 2.7 k ) .",
    "nonequilibrium emission has been invoked to explain the mid - infrared emission of interstellar dust ( draine & anderson 1985 ; weiland 1986 ; dsert 1990 ) .",
    "for example , a 0.001  @xmath4 m silicate grain is predicted to reach maximum temperatures @xmath124  k , but to spend the bulk of the time at temperatures @xmath29  k ( draine & anderson 1985 ) .",
    "the emission from very small grains was modeled by dsert ( 1990 ) from the near - infrared to 1  mm wavelength . in their model",
    "some submillimeter emission is predicted from the small grains , and it accounts for 12% of the emission at 800  @xmath4 m . based on our two - component fits to the spectra of the outer galactic plane ( @xmath125 ) , the very cold component contains @xmath126 of the total emission at 800  @xmath4 m . if the models have underpredicted the 800  @xmath4 m emission of very small grains by a factor of @xmath127 , for example because of our poor understanding of their low - temperature heat capacity , then very small grains could produce the cold component observed in the firas spectra .",
    "however , stochastically heated particles producing the 800  @xmath4 m emission will produce excess emission at wavelengths shorter than 60  @xmath4 m , and will produce mid - infrared colors inconsistent with iras and dirbe observations .",
    "if there were a heating mechanism capable of maintaining very small grains at a minimum temperature @xmath128  k , where they spend the bulk of their time , then they would be able to explain the very cold component ; such a mechanism is not presently known .",
    "a population of cold dust grains , either well mixed with the warm grains or in widely - distributed clouds , could explain the very cold component . balancing heating and cooling , the grain temperature scales as @xmath129 , where @xmath130 is the absorption efficiency averaged over the interstellar radiation field , @xmath131 is the absorption efficiency averaged over the grain s emitted spectrum , @xmath132 is the strength of the interstellar radiation field , and we have assumed @xmath48 .",
    "particles with @xmath130/@xmath131 a factor of @xmath133 lower than that of the grains responsible for the warm ( @xmath134  k ) dust emission could explain the very cold component .",
    "fractal grains have enhanced efficiency for submillimeter emission , and therefore they can cool to very low temperatures ( wright 1993 ) .",
    "a population of fractals may exist such that , when averaged over their size and shape distributions , the peak emission has characteristic temperatures corresponding to the observed cold component . because of their high efficiency at emitting in the far - infrared , even relatively large fractal grains undergo temperature fluctuations ( bazell & dwek 1990 , wright 1993 ) . a population of fractal grains that spend the bulk of the time at very low temperature ( not much above 2.7 k ) and pulse to 510 k after absorbing a photon from the radiation field could produce the observed cold component of the firas spectra .",
    "it is very important that the absorption cross - section per unit mass of fractal grains is substantially higher than for compact spherical grains .",
    "thus the mass of fractal dust required to produce the cold component is not large . in order to explain the correlation of the warm and cold components",
    ", the fractal grains would have to be spatially correlated with the grains responsible for the warm component .",
    "particles sufficiently large that they can cool via photons with wavelengths much smaller than their radii reach an equilibrium temperature in the interstellar radiation field such that @xmath135 k , where @xmath136 is the angular - averaged interstellar radiation field and @xmath137 is the stefan - boltzmann constant .",
    "smaller particles emit with decreased efficiency in the far - infrared , and thus are warmer .",
    "grains of astronomical silicate and graphite ( draine & lee 1984 ) equilibrate at 6 k if they have radii of order 100  @xmath4 m .",
    "similar particles ( _ e.g. _ 30@xmath4 m amorphous c spheres ) have been proposed before , in order to explain excess submillimeter absorption in h  ii regions ( rowan - robinson 1992 ) .",
    "a problem with the hypothesis that large grains produce the very cold component is that the temperature of the cold component does not change much in the inner galaxy , despite a substantially higher heating rate there .    the mass of large grains required to explain the observed submillimeter emission is not large .",
    "at a wavelength of 800  @xmath4 m , the absorption efficiency of 100  @xmath4 m spheres is 0.2 for graphite or 0.4 for silicate ( draine & lee 1984 ) .",
    "the mass of dust required to explain the very cold component is about 0.1% of the mass of interstellar gas . if the large grains contain c or ( mgsife)o@xmath138 groups , their abundance must be less than @xmath139 relative to h by mass ( based on the abundances in anders & grevesse 1989 ) ; this upper limit is a factor of 7 times larger than the inferred mass of large grains .",
    "based on the strength of the 10@xmath4 m bands seen in absorption toward bright infrared sources , nearly all of the cosmic si abundance is locked in grains smaller than 1@xmath4 m ; similarly , infrared absorption bands and the 2200    bump require @xmath140% of c to be locked in small grains ( tielens & allamandola 1987 ) .",
    "this still leaves enough room for the large grains to be composed of either silicates or carbonaceous material .",
    "size distributions of the form @xmath141 , up to a maximum size @xmath142 , have been found to match the wavelength dependence of the extinction of starlight , where @xmath143 with @xmath144  @xmath4 m ( mathis , rumpl , & nordsieck 1977 ; draine & anderson 1985 ) .",
    "if this distribution were to extend from @xmath142 to 100  @xmath4 m , there would be 50 times more particles than are needed to explain the very cold component of the far - infrared spectrum ; therefore the slope of the size distribution from @xmath142 to 100  @xmath4 m would have to steepen to @xmath145 .",
    "we note that there are other limits to the number of very large particles .",
    "for example , inversion of the wavelength - dependence of polarization into a size distribution shows that the size distribution must steepen at sizes larger than @xmath146  @xmath4 m",
    "( kim & martin 1994 ) . any model for the large particles would have to match the extinction and polarization curves , while remaining consistent with cosmic abundances .",
    "the cold component we observe may not be cold dust at all , but rather a spectral feature in the long - wavelength emissivity of the particles that produce the bulk of the far - infrared emission ( ` warm dust ' ) .",
    "such an emissivity feature could arise from resonances in the grains , impurities , or molecules in the mantles .",
    "the fact that the mixing ratio of the cold and warm components is nearly the same at every position motivates this hypothesis . in order to test this hypothesis",
    ", we divided the observed spectra by the warm component of the spectral models with @xmath1 emissivity at low frequency .",
    "this ratio , the emissivity enhancement , should reveal the shape of the spectral feature .",
    "the observed spectrum deviates significantly from the warm component at frequencies below 25 @xmath0 , and the excess at 12 @xmath0 is about 30% .",
    "the enhancement increases toward lower frequencies as @xmath147 , at least to 10 @xmath0 .",
    "if the excess submillimeter emissivity were due to low - frequency resonances in the grains , then it would be expected to eventually disappear at frequencies below the lowest resonant mode . as a check",
    ", we used the dmr observations to check that the two - component modified blackbody spectrum does not exceed the observed sky brightness at frequencies below those to which firas was sensitive .",
    "after subtraction of the dipole component of the cosmic microwave background , the correlation slopes of surface brightness with csc@xmath148 ( for @xmath149 ) were determined in the three dmr wavebands ; the results are shown in table  [ csctab ] .",
    "the firas data in each frequency bin treated similarly , yielding the spectrum for a cosecant galaxy model .",
    "this firas spectrum was fitted by two modified blackbodies of the form in equation  [ modbb ] , with emissivity index @xmath48 .",
    "the warm component has a temperature @xmath150  k and optical depth @xmath151 , and the very cold component has a temperature @xmath152  k and optical depth @xmath153 .",
    "the extrapolation of a one - component fit and a two - component firas fit down to the dmr frequencies is listed in table  [ csctab ] .",
    "neither dust model exceeds the galactic emission observed by dmr .",
    "the dmr observations can not strongly constrain the low - frequency dust spectrum , because synchrotron emission , free - free emission , and cosmic microwave background anisotropies all contribute to the signal .",
    "but the fact that the two - component model does not over - predict the low - frequency emission means that it is possible that the excess dust emissivity extends well into the microwave band . more sensitive microwave observations of the diffuse galactic emission , and a more detailed study combining the radio , microwave , far - infrared , and optical ( cf . reynolds 1992 ) constraints on galactic and cosmic sky brightnesses , are needed to determine the diffuse microwave emission of interstellar dust .",
    "the spectra of the inner galaxy are poorly fit even by two modified blackbodies .",
    "there is a residual emission that peaks around 45  @xmath0 ( 220  @xmath4 m ) , suggesting a temperature around 14  k. this emission is present in spectra within @xmath154 of the galactic center , so it emanates predominantly from within 5.5  kpc of the galactic center . comparing the variation of the brightness of this component to that of the co(10 ) line from the goddard - columbia survey ( dame 1987 ) reveals a rough correspondence , suggesting that this residual emission may be due to dust associated with molecular clouds .",
    "the temperature of this component is similar to that obtained from far - infrared spectra of two bok globules with no local heating sources ( keene 1981 ) .",
    "thus dust shielded from the interstellar radiation field _ is _ present in the firas spectra after all , at a temperature intermediate between that of the ` warm ' dust and that of the ` cold ' dust .",
    "the heating rate of the intermediate - temperature dust is decreased from that of the warm dust by a factor @xmath155 , suggesting extinctions @xmath156 between the intermediate - temperature dust and the interstellar radiation field . by fitting a three - component spectral model to the data",
    ", we found the typical optical depth of the intermediate - temperature component is @xmath157 at 30  @xmath0 , corresponding to a column density @xmath158  @xmath100 .",
    "the column density ( inferred from the optical depth ) and the extinction ( inferred from the temperature ) are in good agreement with observations of @xmath159 and @xmath160 for interstellar gas and dust ( bohlin , savage , & drake 1978 ) .",
    "this component is very weak , contributing only @xmath161% of the emission at 45 @xmath0 and @xmath140 times less power thatn the warm component .",
    "submillimeter and far - infrared observations of other galaxies using ground - based and airborne telescopes are challenging with current technology , and continuous spectral coverage of the dust emission comparable to that obtained by firas for our galaxy has never been achieved . but",
    "a comparison to observations of external galaxies is important for two reasons .",
    "first , the entire far - infrared emission of external galaxies can be measured unambiguously  without confusion from other emission sources such as zodiacal light and background radiation .",
    "and second , observations of other galaxies allow us to determine whether the far - infrared spectral shape is a generic property of cosmic dust or is peculiar to individual galaxies .",
    "most galaxies observed in the submillimeter range are significantly warmer than our galaxy .",
    "eales , wynn - williams , & duncan ( 1989 ) observed a sample of 10 galaxies ( with large 100@xmath4 m fluxes ) at 350@xmath4 m , with some observations at 450 , 800 , & 1100 @xmath4 m as well .",
    "their beamsize corresponded to 3 kpc for the nearest and 30 kpc for the most distant galaxies observed .",
    "the firas spectra of the galactic center and inner galaxy are substantially cooler than the average spectrum of eales : the submillimeter fluxes are relatively higher and the 60@xmath4 m flux is lower . in another survey ,",
    "clements , andreani , & chase ( 1993 ) reported observations of 5 galaxies at 450 , 800 , & 1100 @xmath4 m , with beamsizes ranging from 1.412 kpc .",
    "for the 5 galaxies , the temperature of a single - component fit ranged from 2835  k , compared to the range 1623  k for spectra of our galaxy .",
    "recently , franceschini & andreani ( 1995 ) reported on a 1.25 mm survey of a complete sample of southern galaxies , with a selection criterion based on the  60@xmath4 m flux .",
    "their average spectrum is also ` warmer ' than that of the milky way , and they found no evidence for substantial emission from cold dust .",
    "evidently the galaxies selected in these surveys are warmer than our galaxy because they were selected based on their brightness at 60100  @xmath4 m : using the  surface brightness to select galaxies apparently selects the warmest galaxies .",
    "based on the observed temperatures , it is likely that the average radiation field within these galaxies is nearly an order of magnitude stronger than that in our own galaxy .",
    "one other study has shown that the far - infrared spectrum of the milky way is not atypical .",
    "stark ( 1989 ) observed three spirals in the virgo cluster at 160@xmath4 m and 360@xmath4 m with a resolution corresponding to 6.5  kpc .",
    "when we combine the firas spectra within @xmath162 of the galactic center , a region that should correspond to what stark would have observed if our galaxy were at the distance of virgo , we find that the spectrum of our galaxy is entirely consistent with that of the virgo spirals .      the lack of substantial power emitted by dust with temperatures in the 415  k range places strong constraints on the amount of very cold material in the interstellar medium .",
    "the discovery of co absorption lines from clouds in the outer galaxy led to the suggestion that very cold molecular clouds , which would be very difficult to detect by co emission , may be an important , massive component of the galaxy ( lequeux , allen , & guilloteau 1993 ) .",
    "the power of all starlight incident on such cold clouds would be reemitted within the firas bandpass .",
    "in fact , there is little power emitted besides that contained in the warm component ; the fraction of the total power contained in the cold component is shown in figure  [ coldpow ] .",
    "because the cold component is detected in every direction , it can not be attributed to outer galaxy molecular clouds ; therefore the power shown in figure  [ coldpow ] is an upper limit .",
    "further , the cold component contains less than 0.05% of the power in the local interstellar radiation field , so that it can not be due to optically thick clouds if it is produced locally .",
    "any model for the galactic interstellar medium including a substantial increase in the abundance of dark clouds must comply with the constraint that very little power is emitted by cold dust .",
    "this constraint has been neglected in some recent work ( _ e.g. _ lequeux 1993 ; pfenniger , combes , & martinet 1994a ) .",
    "one possibility is that such clouds have a very low dust abundance .",
    "this would be consistent with the low gas temperature , because the photoelectric heating by dust grains would be absent .",
    "however , there is evidence for star formation in the far outer galaxy ( de geus 1993 ) , so there should be dust formation in stellar outflows and supernovae .",
    "another possibility is that the radiation field is a factor of @xmath163 lower in the region of the cold clouds .",
    "this too is contradicted by the presence of star formation .",
    "furthermore , power absorbed from the extragalactic radiation field would still be a factor of @xmath164 brighter than our upper limit .",
    "the continuous spectrum of galactic dust observed by the /firas can be characterized as a sum of three emission components : warm dust heated by the interstellar radiation field , intermediate - temperature dust heated by the attenuated radiation field in molecular clouds , and a very cold component .",
    "the very cold component is correlated with the warm dust , emits very little power , and its temperature does not increase in the inner galaxy . the very cold component is unlikely to be due to dust that is cold because it is shielded from the interstellar radiation field . the very cold component may be a spectral feature in the warm dust constituent material , or may be due to fractal or needle - like grains or particles substantially larger than those responsible for the warm component .",
    "the lack of substantial power from cold dust limits the amount of cold gas in the outer galaxy and makes it unlikely that such gas could contribute an unseen , massive component of the galaxy .",
    "the existence of enhanced submillimeter emission from interstellar dust , regardless of its origin , implies an increased contribution to the microwave sky brightness by the galaxy than previously expected from extrapolations of 100 @xmath4 m observations ( _ e.g. _ by ) .",
    "the interstellar dust emission can be characterized by a two - temperature approximation with temperatures and optical depths as shown in figure  [ mapparfig ] .",
    "the implications for searches for _ fluctuations _ in the microwave background radiation are not yet clear .",
    "if the cold component is due to enhanced emissivity of the warm dust constituent material , then its spatial fluctuations will be comparable to those of an  100@xmath4 m map .",
    "however , if the cold component is due to a separate population of dust grains in clouds with a substantially different morphology than previously considered , the fluctuations in the microwave sky brightness due to interstellar dust could be notably enhanced ."
