    "at hera , @xmath4 electrons ( or positrons ) were collided with @xmath5 protons providing a center - of - mass energy of @xmath6 .",
    "the h1 and zeus experiments each collected data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about @xmath7 , split into two running phases : herai and heraii .",
    "the dominant production process for heavy quarks at hera is photon gluon fusion , in which a photon emitted from the electron fuses with a gluon in the proton producing a quark anti - quark pair .",
    "thus the production of heavy quarks is directly sensitive to the gluon density in the proton . in the case of electroproduction or deep - inelastic scattering ( dis ) ,",
    "the virtuality of the exchanged photon is large ( @xmath8 ) and provides a hard scale for reliable calculations in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd ) .",
    "the available pqcd calculations are performed in a scheme ( `` massive '' ) which assumes no heavy quark content of the proton and are based on collinear or @xmath9 factorisation .",
    "many experimental results for charm production at hera use charm mesons to identify the presence of charm quarks , especially the @xmath10 meson exploiting the well known mass difference method .",
    "the h1 collaboration presented new preliminary measurements of the electroproduction of @xmath10 mesons in two regions of the photon virtuality : @xmath11  @xcite and @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the visible phase space of the @xmath10 meson is restricted to @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the results are based on the full heraii statistics corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about @xmath15 .",
    "the next - to - leading order ( nlo ) massive qcd calculation hvqdis  @xcite ( using collinear factorisation ) agrees with the measurement up to the largest @xmath16 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : dstar_q2 ] ( a ) ) where the massive approach is not expected to be appropriate .",

    "[ fig : dstar_q2],title=\"fig : \" ]    the single and double differential cross sections as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath18 and the pseudorapidity @xmath19 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dstar_q2 ] ( b ) ) of the @xmath20 meson are reasonably well described by hvqdis and show a sensitivity to the gluon density in the proton .",
    "unfortunately , the theoretical uncertainties due to a variation of the charm mass , the renormalisation and factorisation scales and the fragmentation parameter @xmath21 are larger than the experimental uncertainties .",
    "the zeus collaboration has measured differential cross sections for @xmath10  @xcite , @xmath22 and @xmath23  @xcite mesons in the range @xmath24 based on part of the heraii luminosity . for the @xmath22 and the @xmath23 analysis",
    "the signal - to - background ratio has been improved by using lifetime information from the micro vertex detector .",
    "the hvqdis prediction describes the @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 distributions for all charm mesons reasonably well .    in order to study the charm production process further the angular correlation of dijets in events with @xmath25 mesons",
    "was measured by the h1 experiment  @xcite . at small azimuthal differences between the two jets , where higher order processes are expected to contribute ,",
    "the hvqdis calculation as well as the leading order ( lo ) monte carlo program cascade  @xcite , based on @xmath9 factorisation and including parton showers , have problems to describe the data .",
    "r0.58        since the beauty cross section at hera is very small , the reconstruction of exclusive hadron decays is difficult .",
    "therefore , more efficient tagging methods which exploit either the long lifetime of @xmath26 hadrons using precise silicon vertex detectors ( displaced track method ) or the large @xmath27 quark mass using the transverse momentum of leptons with respect to jets ( @xmath28 method ) , are used instead . a new preliminary measurement  @xcite combining the methods in events with a muon and a jet",
    "was presented by the zeus experiment .",
    "the kinematic range was restricted to @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . as the jet was used only for tagging purposes , a loose jet selection of @xmath32 and @xmath33",
    "was applied .",
    "the cross sections were extracted by a three - dimensional fit to the impact parameter , the momentum of the muon transverse to the jet and the missing transverse momentum parallel to the muon direction .",
    "the measured differential beauty and charm cross sections are reasonably well described by hvqdis ( fig .",
    "[ fig : beauty_eta ] ) .",
    "the charm and beauty contributions , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , to the inclusive proton structure function @xmath3 can be extracted from the cross section measurements by extrapolating to the full phase space of the studied final state .",
    "a different approach is employed in the inclusive lifetime analysis , where all tracks with lifetime information from precise measurements in the central silicon detector are used .",
    "the h1 collaboration presented a preliminary analysis  @xcite based on this approach using a neural net to improve the separation power .",
    "a comparison of the different measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : inclusive ] .",
    "the experimental results agree well with each other .",
    "nlo qcd predictions with different proton parton distributions can describe the data and show the sensitivity of the data to the gluon density .",
    "one important ingredient to the extraction of the charm production cross section and the charm contribution @xmath34 to the proton structure function from measured @xmath35 meson cross sections is the fragmentation that describes the transition of a charm quark into a charm hadron .",
    "the spectrum of the momentum fraction @xmath36 transferred from the heavy quark to the hadron influences strongly the transverse momentum distribution of the heavy hadron and thus the extrapolation from differential cross sections to @xmath34 .",
    "both zeus  @xcite and h1  @xcite have studied the fragmentation of charm quarks . in the presence of a jet",
    "both experiments find results consistent with fragmentation functions determined from @xmath37 data indicating that fragmentation is universal . for events with no jets , corresponding to low photon gluon centre - of - mass energies , h1 finds a harder fragmentation which can be interpreted as an inadequacy of the qcd models to provide a consistent description of the full phase space down to the kinematic threshold .",
    "several new measurements of the electroproduction of charm and beauty quarks at hera from the h1 and zeus collaborations were presented . in general",
    "the measurements are reasonably well described by the next - to - leading order perturbative qcd calculation hvqdis .",
    "the charm and beauty contributions , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , to the inclusive proton structure function @xmath3 extracted with different methods agree with each other and show sensitivity to the gluon density in the proton .",
