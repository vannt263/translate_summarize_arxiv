    "by matching the luminosity , atmospheric parameters , and oscillation frequencies of models with the observed ones , asteroseismology is used to determine fundamental parameters of stars .",
    "asteroseismology is also used to probe physical processes in stars and diagnose internal structures of stars @xcite .",
    "asteroseismology is a powerful tool for studying the structure and evolution of stars .",
    "stars with a mass larger than @xmath4 are considered to have a convective core during their main sequence ( ms ) stage . due to the fact that the overshooting of the convective core can bring more hydrogen - rich material into the core",
    ", the evolution of a star could be significantly affected by the overshooting . thus determining the size of the convective core including the overshooting region is important for understanding the structure and evolution of stars .",
    "however , the size of the convective core has never been determined directly from observed data of stars .",
    "generally , the understanding of the size of the convective core derives from the computation of evolutionary models of stars .    when seeking to probe the internal structures of stars with low-@xmath5 p - modes , the small separations , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , and the ratios of the small separations to the large separations , , , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , are considered to be the very useful diagnostic tools .",
    "the small separations @xmath6 and @xmath7 are defined as @xcite @xmath12 and @xmath13 but in calculation , the smoother five - point separations are adopted .",
    "stars with masses between about 1.1 and 1.5 have a convective core during their ms .",
    "the discontinuity in density at the edge of the convective core increases with the evolution of the stars .",
    "the rapid variation of density with depth in a stellar core can distort acoustic wave propagation in stellar interiors , producing a reflected wave @xcite .",
    "the reflectivity can come from the rapid density change at the edge of the convective core @xcite .",
    "for the modes with frequencies larger than a critical frequency , they can penetrate into the convective core .",
    "partial wave reflection at the core boundary could lead to acoustic resonances in the convective core @xcite . as a consequence , at high frequencies ,",
    "we would see a periodic variation in the small separations with frequency @xcite .",
    "if this periodic component is determined from observations , it can be used for constraining the size of the convective core @xcite .",
    "@xcite developed the theory of semiclassical analysis that can more accurately describe the low - degree p - modes and the small separations .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that their expressions for the perturbations in the phase shifts are not transparent enough to serve as a basis for simple estimates .",
    "the effects of the convective core on @xmath6 , @xmath7 , , and are also studied by other authors @xcite .",
    "the conclusion is that the ratios and can be affected by the presence of the convective core .    in order to isolate the frequency perturbation produced by the edge of the convective core",
    ", @xcite and @xcite defined a tool @xmath14 .",
    "they have shown that the tool can potentially be used to infer information about the amplitude of the discontinuity in the sound speed at the edge of the convective core but it is unable to fully isolate the frequency perturbation .",
    "@xcite show that the ratios and of a star with a convective core can be described by equation @xmath15 where the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath17 are two parameters , the @xmath18 is the frequency of @xmath19 mode whose inner turning point is located on the boundary between the radiative region and the overshooting region of the convective core .    in this work ,",
    "we propose a method to estimate the radius of the convective core of ms stars with masses between about 1.1 and 1.5 from observed frequencies of low - degree p - modes .",
    "the estimated radius is comparable with that obtained from evolutionary model .",
    "individual frequencies of p - modes of kic 9812850 have been extracted by @xcite .",
    "the mass of kic 9812850 estimated by @xcite is @xmath20 .",
    "thus kic 9812850 could have a convective core .",
    "we determined the radius of the convective core of kic 9812850 in two ways .",
    "one is estimated from the observed frequencies ; the other is determined from the best model for kic 9812850 . in section 2 , a formula that can be used to determine the radius of the convective core from oscillation frequencies",
    "is proposed and is applied to different stars . in section 3 ,",
    "based on finding the maximum likelihood of models of a grid of evolutionary tracks , the best - fit model of kic 9812850 is found out ; and then , we compare the radius of the convective core of the best model with that determined from oscillation frequencies .",
    "finally , we give a discussion about the domain of the validity of the method and summary in section 4 .",
    "the inner turning point , @xmath21 , of the mode with a frequency @xmath22 is determined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the adiabatic sound speed at radius @xmath21 , the value of the parameter @xmath25 is @xmath26 @xcite . for the modes with @xmath19 , the frequency @xmath18 of the mode",
    "whose inner turning point is just located on the boundary between the radiative region and the overshooting region of the convective core can be estimated by equation ( [ eqb ] ) from observed frequencies and the ratios computed from the frequencies .",
    "thus the radius of the convective core including the overshooting region , @xmath27 , can be determined by @xmath28 in the middle stage of ms stars with masses between about 1.1 and 1.5 , the magnitude of @xmath29 is of the order of about @xmath30 cm s@xmath31 .",
    "thus for the ms stars extracted individual frequencies of low - degree p - modes , combining the equation ( [ eqb ] ) , the radius @xmath27 can be estimated by @xmath32 from the observed data .    * by using the function of nonlinear curve fitting of origin software where chi - square fitting is used and hessian matrix is calculated , * from the observed frequencies @xcite and ratio of hd 49933 , * we obtained * that the value of * the parameter @xmath18 of equation ( [ eqb ] ) * is @xmath33 * for hd 49933*. from the observed frequencies of kic 6225718 @xcite and ratio , the value of @xmath18 is estimated to be about @xmath34 . from the frequencies of kic 2837475 and kic 11081729 given by @xcite , the value of @xmath18 is estimated to be @xmath35 for kic 2837475 and @xmath36 for kic 11081729 .    using formula ( [ rc2 ] ) , one can obtain that the radius of the convective core including overshooting region is about @xmath37 for kic 6225718 , @xmath38 for hd 49933 , @xmath39 for kic 2837475 , and @xmath40 for kic 11081729 .",

    "the values of radius @xmath27 of these stars , estimated from observed data , are in good agreement with those obtained from the models of the stars .",
