    "the heavy ion program of run 2 of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) is scheduled to commence in late 2015 with collisions of lead ions at an energy of 5.02 tev per nucleon pair .",
    "this follows lower energy collisions of 2.76 tev in run 1 , as well as collisions of various ions at the relativistic heavy - ion collider up to 200 gev per nucleon pair . during this time , a consensus picture has emerged of the collision system evolving according to the equations of relativistic viscous fluid dynamics  @xcite .",
    "many hydrodynamic calculations have been performed , showing remarkable agreement with a wide variety of observables  @xcite , including a number of predictions  @xcite made before the measurements were performed  @xcite .",
    "the new heavy - ion run presents an opportunity to further test this picture in a new energy regime .    despite this success of hydrodynamic models ,",
    "there remains significant uncertainties .",
    "in particular , the initial , non - equilibrium stages of the collision are not well understood , and similarly for temperature - dependent transport coefficients .",
    "generically , a minimum in @xmath0 is expected near the cross - over temperature @xcite both from the hadron gas phase @xcite and the qgp phase @xcite , but the exact location , magnitude , and slope of that minimum is unknown .",
    "multiple models for initial conditions  @xcite and multiple parameterizations of shear viscosity  @xcite , for example , are able to give a good description of data .",
    "in addition to uncertainties in the theory , there are systematic uncertainties in the measurements .",
    "even if a calculation fits all the data within the experimental error bars , which is rarely the case , one clearly can not trust any particular calculation to be correct with a precision better than these error bars . due to these various uncertainties ,",
    "there is a limit to the precision with which one can trust a prediction for a new collision system , made using a particular model of initial conditions and a single choice for medium properties and freeze - out prescription .",
    "however , we argue that one can actually make precise and reliable predictions without assuming a particular model for initial conditions or values for medium properties . instead of choosing a particular model ( with parameters chosen to give a reasonable fit to existing data ) and doing a single calculation of the new collision system , the idea is to directly use previously measured values as a baseline and focus on the _ change _ in observables of a pb - pb collision system as the energy is increased from 2.76 tev to 5.02 tev per nucleon pair .    by doing this ,",
    "the uncertainties are significantly reduced  not only theoretical uncertainties , but also experimental systematic uncertainties , which will partially cancel for pairs of measurements done at the two collision energies using the same detector and with the same analysis . as a result",
    ", we can do multiple calculations with many initial conditions and model parameters , to obtain a prediction that is more precise and robust .    in the same vein , to make a prediction that is as reliable as possible , we focus on bulk , momentum - integrated observables for unidentified charged hadrons , which have significantly smaller uncertainties than more differential observables or more rare particles .",
    "specifically , we focus on mean transverse momentum @xmath1 along with integrated elliptic flow @xmath2 and triangular flow @xmath3 .",
    "we aim to have a prediction that is as model - independent as possible .",
    "one input that is needed is the charged hadron multiplicity at the increased collision energy . in the following ,",
    "we use the parameterization of the scaling of multiplicity  @xcite with collision energy @xmath4 , where the exponent uses the recent measurement at 5.02  tev  @xcite .    in hydrodynamic calculations ,",
    "the momentum integrated @xmath5 and @xmath6 can be accurately predicted in any given collision event by measures of the initial spatial anisotropy known as eccentricity @xmath7 and triangularity @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "that is , @xmath9 with @xmath10 here @xmath11 is usually taken to be either energy density or entropy density , with each having roughly equivalent predictive power @xcite . in this work",
    "we calculate both and verify that the result has a negligible difference .",
    "@xmath12 represents the hydrodynamic response .",
    "it depends on aspects such as medium properties and the freeze - out prescription , but is considered to be independent of the initial conditions and is therefore the same in every event ( within a given centrality class ) .",
    "therefore , the change in elliptic and triangular flow can be separately studied as a change in the initial @xmath13 , compounded by a change in the hydrodynamic response @xmath14 .",
    "we address the former by gathering a set of models for initial conditions and calculating the change in @xmath7 and @xmath8 . since @xmath15 , we are interested in the change in the root mean square . here",
    "we investigate the following models  mc - glauber  @xcite , mc - kln  @xcite , mcrcbk  @xcite , and trento  @xcite .",
    "percent change in rms eccentricity @xmath7 ( a ) and triangularity @xmath8 ( b ) when the collision energy is increased from 2.76 tev to 5.02 tev , for several models of initial conditions for heavy - ion collisions  mc - glauber  @xcite , trento  @xcite , mc - kln  @xcite , and mcrcbk  @xcite .",
    "]    each of these models uses the measured nucleon - nucleon inelastic cross section @xmath16 as input .",
    "this quantity is not measured directly at @xmath17 or @xmath18  tev . at @xmath17  tev",
    ", we use the standard value  @xcite @xmath19  mb . for the extrapolation to @xmath18  tev",
    ", we use the parameterization of the total @xmath20 cross section by the particle data group collaboration  @xcite and the parameterization of the ratio of elastic to total cross section from ref .",
    "@xcite and choose @xmath21  mb .    for the glauber model",
    ", we use the phobos monte carlo glauber @xcite v1.0 to calculate eccentricities .",
    "we use the binary collision fraction from  @xcite .",
    "the only change with collision energy is the inelastic cross section , as described above .",
    "trento @xcite is a phenomenological model with parameters that allow one to smoothly interpolate between various types of initial conditions .",
    "for example , one limit corresponds to a glauber model with participant scaling . here , we choose the set of parameters that best reproduce multiplicity distributions in pb+pb , p+pb , and p+p collisions at the lhc , and which approximately correspond to eccentricities from the ip - glasma model : @xmath22 , @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "mc - kln @xcite is a model based on saturation physics that calculates gluon production using the @xmath24 factorization formula and an ansatz for the unintegrated gluon distribution .",
    "we calculate using default parameters from the latest version mckln-3.52 .",
    "lastly , we use the mcrcbk model @xcite , calculated with default parameters from mckt - v1.32 .",
    "it is similar to mc - kln in that it uses the @xmath24 factorization formula as a starting point .",
    "however , instead of the kln ansatz for the unintegrated gluon distributions , they are calculated from the running coupling bk equation .",
    "the results from all models are shown in figure [ ecc ] . over all centralities and every model ,",
    "the change from 2.76 tev to 5.02 tev is between -2% and 2% for rms @xmath7 and between -3% and 1% for @xmath8 .    to investigate the change in the hydrodynamic response ,",
    "we perform viscous hydrodynamic calculations using the 2 + 1 relativistic viscous hydrodynamical code , v - usphydro @xcite .",
    "v - usphydro uses smoothed particle hydrodynamics , a lagrangian method to solve the equations of motion on an event - by - event basis , where the smoothing parameter is set to @xmath25 fm for all calculations @xcite .",
    "we start by generating events from a monte carlo glauber model , with a scale factor chosen for each set of parameters to match the charged hadron multiplicity at 2.76 tev",
    ". then we scale each initial condition by a constant factor to calculate the hydrodynamic response at 5.02 tev . in this way ,",
    "the geometry of each event is fixed , and we can isolate the change in the hydrodynamic response @xmath14 and in @xmath1 .",
    "the actual eccentricity distribution of the glauber model used , is therefore irrelevant .",
    "we use the lattice - based equation of state eos s95n - v1 from @xcite , and calculate the change of observables using all charged hadrons including all resonance decays  @xcite .",
    "the following @xmath26-integrated results correspond to the range @xmath27 gev , but predictions for other relevant ranges are presented in [ appendix ] .",

    "error bars represent statistical uncertainty from the finite number of generated events .",
    "see text for details . ]",
    "we choose for a default set of parameters @xmath30  @xmath31 , @xmath32 mev , and a temperature - dependent sheer viscosity @xmath0 as labelled ` param1 ' in @xcite ( converted to a chemical equilibrium equation of state as in fig .",
    "23 from that reference ) .",
    "the change in @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 for run 2 relative to run 1 are shown in fig .",
    "[ response ] . in general ,",
    "the predicted changes are at the several percent level , with the mean transverse momentum increasing by approximately 3% across all centralities .",
    "recall that a non - trivial prediction from hydrodynamics is that @xmath1 depends little on centrality  @xcite , and so it is unsurprising that the _ change _ also depends little on centrality . the mean transverse momentum is driven by by the equation of state both in ideal  @xcite and viscous  @xcite hydrodynamics .",
    "more precisely , it scales like the energy per particle at the time when transverse flow builds up .",
    "the multiplicity near midrapidity @xmath33 is proportional to the entropy , therefore @xmath1 scales like @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the energy and entropy density respectively  @xcite .",
    "hence the relative increase of @xmath1 is @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the pressure , and we have used the thermodynamic relations @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 .",
    "the temperature when transverse flow builds up at the lhc is in the range @xmath42  mev  @xcite . in this temperature range , @xmath43  @xcite , and eq .  ( [ deltapt ] ) explains why a 20% increase in multiplicity corresponds to a 3% increase in @xmath1 .",
    "our prediction , if confirmed by experimental data , thus provides a direct experimental verification of the qcd equation of state .    while the predicted increase in @xmath1 depends little on centrality , elliptic and triangular flow",
    "have the largest increase in peripheral collisions .",
    "this is also expected generically .",
    "note that anisotropic flow is generated as a response to a spatial anisotropy . in a given collision event ,",
    "this spatial anisotropy decreases with time , and the generation of anisotropic flow therefore slows .",
    "peripheral events , with the shortest lifetime , are still rapidly generating @xmath44 when they freeze out , and therefore generate significantly more when the lifetime is increased . on the other hand",
    ", central collisions already have a long lifetime at 2.76 tev , and have therefore essentially saturated the anisotropic flow .",
    "in fact , the spatial anisotropy can eventually go through zero and change sign , resulting in a slight _ decrease _ in @xmath44 with extra lifetime . from fig .",
    "[ response ] , one can see that this is indeed our prediction for @xmath5 in the most central collisions",
    ".    predicted percent change in @xmath2 ( a ) , @xmath3 ( b ) , and @xmath1 ( c ) when the collision energy is increased from 2.76 tev to 5.02 tev .",
    "the dark band indicates the predicted change only from the hydrodynamic response , which is the dominant contribution to the error band , while the light band in the upper two plots includes the effect from a change in initial eccentricity .",
    "the solid lines represent a polynomial fit to the limits of the error band , which can be used to interpolate our prediction to any particular centrality . ]",
    "while this set of hydrodynamic parameters can give a reasonable fit to existing data given a judicious choice of initial conditions , there is uncertainty in their values .",
    "because of this , we vary each parameter , in order to get an idea of the robustness of our prediction . in each case , we rescale the initial conditions in order to keep the final multiplicity fixed .",
    "[ response ] shows the result when we separately change the shear viscosity from our fairly strong default temperature dependence , to constant values of @xmath45  @xcite and @xmath46 .",
    "the latter choice is motivated by the observation that there is no lower bound on @xmath47 from experimental data alone  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we vary the freeze - out temperature to @xmath48 which was found to be the highest value able to fit @xmath26 spectra at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "we vary the initial time to @xmath49  @xmath31 to mimic the effect of initial transverse flow @xcite .",
    "note that , while these parameters can have a very significant affect on the absolute values of @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath1 , the affect of changing the parameters tends to be similar at each collision energy , and therefore there is a much smaller affect on the _ difference_. in fact , it s possible that not all of these parameter sets would be able to fit data even at 2.76 tev , but these results should give a conservative idea of the size of uncertainty in our prediction .",
    "we can see that the uncertainty in our prediction for @xmath1 is largely due to the uncertainty in @xmath47 , while for @xmath5 and @xmath6 it is more sensitive to freeze out .",
    "the uncertainty in the change in initial eccentricity appears to be much smaller than in the hydro response .    in fig .",
    "[ prediction ] we combine the changes in initial spatial anisotropy and the hydrodynamic response , using the range of results as an estimate of systematic uncertainty , to show our overall predictions for the change in each measured quantity .",
    "we note that we have not investigated the effect of bulk viscosity , which could potentially increase our error band .",
    "however , since bulk viscosity is expected to decrease quickly at high temperature , we expect that its effect should decrease with collision energy .",
    "in a recent preprint @xcite , predictions were given using the ekrt model of initial conditions and several choices of @xmath0 .",
    "for the parameterizations of @xmath0 that work best across various energies , they fall within our band of theoretical uncertainties . however , the two parameterizations that fail to fit rhic data and correlations of event - plane angles @xcite would predict a larger anisotropic flow in central collisions than our result .    finally , we take the results from existing measurements , and scale up by our predicted change , to give an absolute prediction for the values of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for various analyses from alice , cms , and atlas .",
    "the results are shown in [ appendix ] .",
    "we have presented predictions for the upcoming heavy - ion run at the lhc . by using previous measurements at lower energy as a baseline ,",
    "we are able to make precise predictions for the evolution of observables as the collision energy is increased from 2.76 tev to 5.02 tev , and which can be tested with significant precision by performing the same experimental analyses at both collision energies , resulting in a reduced systematic uncertainty on the change with energy .",
    "further , we make our predictions as model - independent as possible by focussing on specific observables and doing numerous calculations for various models and parameters to make a robust prediction .",
    "specifically , we choose @xmath1 because it is insensitive to model details , and momentum - integrated @xmath2 and @xmath3 , because they have much smaller uncertainty than differential measurements , and because these particular harmonics allow for a linear response analysis .",
    "compared to the lower energy lhc measurement , we predict that @xmath50 will increase between 2.5%-3.5% with the largest increase in central collisions , but little centrality dependence overall . @xmath2 and",
    "@xmath3 will see the largest increases in peripheral collisions , of at least several percent , while in central collisions @xmath3 and @xmath2 will see little change .",
    "these predictions provide an opportunity to precisely test the hydrodynamic paradigm of heavy - ion collisions .",
    "any deviation of measurements from these predictions would highlight possible gaps in our current understanding , while the exact measured value within the predicted range could determine features such as the temperature dependence of viscosity , bulk viscous effects , and hadronic physics at freeze out .",
