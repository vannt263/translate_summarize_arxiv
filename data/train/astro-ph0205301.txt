    "formation of a circumstellar disk is recognized as a natural step in the process of star formation and a vital step toward forming planets .",
    "currently our knowledge of protoplanetary disk properties at anthropically interesting distances of 1 - 30  au is relatively limited .",
    "the best spectroscopic constraints on disk temperature and density structure are dominated by material either within 0.5  au of the central source ( najita et al .",
    "1996 ; carr , mathieu , & najita 2001 ) or at radii @xmath450  au ( dutrey , guilloteau , & simon 1994 ) .",
    "this radial sampling results from the tracers utilized to date : dust emission and scattering and co ro - vibrational and rotational emission . using  rotational lines as a tracer may allow study of disks at radii of 1 - 50  au .",
    "recent work by thi et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2001a , 2001b ) report  @xmath0 @xmath5 and @xmath1 emission from pre - main - sequence and main - sequence stars with circumstellar disks . from infrared space observatory ( iso ) data , these authors derive gas temperatures of 100 - 200  k and masses up to 2@xmath610@xmath7  . in the case of disks around main - sequence stars ( thi et al .",
    "2001a ) , previously thought to be mostly gas - free ( zuckerman , forveille , & kastner 1995 ) , the presence of a substantial reservoir of  alters ideas on the formation of giant planets ( lissauer 2001 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the large aperture and low spectral resolution of the observations leave open the question of whether the emission really comes from a disk .",
    "three mid - ir  pure rotational lines are readily available from high , dry sites if observed at moderately high spectral resolution : @xmath0  @xmath1 [ _ i.e. _ s(1 ) ] at 17  , @xmath2 [ _ i.e. _ s(2 ) ] at 12  , and @xmath8 [ _ i.e. _ s(4 ) ] at 8  .",
    "the high spectral and spatial resolution possible with ground - based spectroscopy , together with large telescope apertures , can result in greater sensitivity to certain gas distributions than satellite observations .",
    "in particular , ground - based spectroscopy is well suited for detecting point sources with narrow line emission , such as gas in keplerian orbit at a radius of 1 - 50  au from a solar - mass star .",
    "we report here on observations of a small sample of young stars taken with the texas echelon cross echelle spectrograph ( texes ) in an effort to confirm the iso detections and explore the feasibility of ground - based observations of  from circumstellar disks .",
    "we used texes ( lacy et al .",
    "2002 ) at the nasa 3 m infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) to observe the h@xmath9  @xmath1  transition [ @xmath10  or @xmath11  ] and the @xmath2 transition [ @xmath12  or @xmath13  ] .",
    "all the observations were made with texes in high - resolution mode .",
    "pertinent details regarding the observations may be found in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "all sources were observed while using the irtf offset guide camera as well as guiding on the dispersed continuum seen through the spectrograph .",
    "the case of gg  tau  deserves special comment since it has weak continuum , is a strong case for iso detection ( thi et al .",
    "1999 ; thi et al .",
    "2001b ) , and has a unique geometry .",
    "the source is a quadruple system composed of a pair of binaries .",
    "gg  tau  a is a 0.25 binary with millimeter continuum emission ( guilloteau , dutrey , & simon 1999 ) and hst scattered light observations ( silber et al . 2000 ) showing a circumbinary ring extending roughly from 180 to 260  au ( 1.29 - 1.86 ) .",
    "the ring is tipped at 37@xmath14 , resulting in an ellipse on the sky with the major axis running essentially e - w . when we observed gg  tau  a , we widened the slit to 3  and rotated the instrument to orient the slit so that the major axis of the projected ellipse would lie along our slit .",
    "the weak continuum of gg  tau  meant we could not guide on continuum signal through the spectrograph .",
    "therefore , we repeatedly checked our infrared boresight by observations of @xmath15  tau , a nearby , bright infrared source .",
    "the maximum boresight offset found based on the @xmath15  tau observations was 0.5 , with a mean offset of 0.2 . by summing over @xmath164  along the slit",
    ", we can confidently state that we observed essentially all of the gg  tau  a gap region .",
    "correction for atmospheric transmission was done using bright infrared continuum objects , either stars or asteroids .",
    "although most stars later than spectral type g show photospheric features at r@xmath17 , we can locate features using the kitt peak sunspot atlas ( wallace , livingston , & bernath 1994 ) and the atmos3 photospheric atlas ( geller 1992 ) and know that there are no features near the  transitions .",
    "asteroids have no features at our resolution . both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines are near telluric atmospheric lines , but the doppler shift of the source , the earth s motion , and the high spectral resolution available with texes helped to minimize atmospheric effects .",
    "flux calibration was done using a blackbody and standard stars .",
    "the data were reduced using the texes data pipeline ( lacy et al .",
    "we extracted spectra from the data with several strategies : optimal extraction of the point source to look for emission coincident with the continuum , sums over the nodded region to look for diffuse emission covering half the slit length , and selected sums along the slit to look for isolated emission offset from the point source .",
    "we saw no evidence for extended emission in any spectrum , although uniform emission on @xmath185  scales would not be recovered .",
    "figure  [ fig : s1 ] presents @xmath1 spectra for the three sources we observed that also have reported iso detections : gg  tau , ab  aur , and hd  163296 . to indicate the line flux reported by thi et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , we overplot gaussians with an integrated line flux equal to the iso measurements . since iso was unable to resolve the line profiles , we have simply assumed gaussian fwhm matching our resolution ( 5 or 7.5  , depending on slit width ) and 30  , with the gaussians centered at the systemic v@xmath19 .",
    "the figures clearly show a discrepancy between the reported line flux and our observations .    of all our spectra , only the ab  aur  12  spectrum shows a possible detection ( figure  [ fig : s2 ] ) .",
    "a gaussian fit to the ab  aur  data finds a feature centered at the systemic velocity with a fwhm=10.5  and a line flux of 2.0 ( @xmath201.0 ) @xmath21  .",
    "there are no terrestrial lines and no photospheric absorption lines in the comparison star at this frequency that might artificially produce an emission feature .",
    "we discuss the implications of these data , particularly in light of the non - detection of the @xmath1 line , below .",
    "table  [ tab : res ] summarizes the results for all our observations . in all cases , we measure continuum levels comparable to past measurements , although the noise for gg  tau  is such that many pixels must be combined to obtain a significant continuum measurement .",
    "we established line flux errors by summing over the number of pixels corresponding to the assumed line widths at all parts of the spectrum with comparable atmospheric transmission .",
    "we then use the line flux upper limit for the more conservative case of a 30  fwhm line to calculate a maximum mass of  assuming temperatures of 150  k and 300  k. note that these masses assume no extinction and do not include gas in equilibrium with optically thick dust .",
    "we observed six sources with reasonable evidence for disks and report no convincing detection of  pure - rotational emission . our non - detections have bearing on the interpretation of previous iso reports and on the distribution of gas and dust in these sources . in all cases where we set limits , those limits are subject to uncertainties in the assumed gas temperature and the assumed line widths .",
    "to provide an example of our sensitivity to these assumptions , we include two line widths and two gas temperatures in table  [ tab : res ] .    three reported iso detections of  from circumstellar disks , out of three tested , are not seen with texes . for iso to detect emission that we would miss ,",
    "the emission can either be extended or it can be spectrally broad . given that the iso - sws aperture at 17  covered 14  by 27 , compared with our effective aperture of 2  by 2  ( 280  au by 280  au at taurus : d=140 pc . ) , and that iso detected  rotational lines from molecular clouds with even fairly modest incident uv fields ( li et al .",
    "2002 ) , the presence of extended emission is possible .",
    "thi et al . ( 2001b ) address this issue using @xmath22co 3 - 2 emission and conclude that gg  tau shows no contaminating molecular material , that the bulk of molecular material for hd  163296 lies in the disk , but that ab  aur may have a significant contribution from an extended envelope . for the case of broad lines ,",
    "we believe we would have seen lines as broad as @xmath1650  ( see figure  [ fig : s1 ] and table  [ tab : res ] ) .",
    "even for the case of gg  tau , we would have seen a line as broad as 30  at the 2@xmath3 level , given the best fit line flux in thi et al .",
    "( 2001b ) , although the uncertainties are large enough that these observations may not be in conflict , especially for a broad line .",
    "recent  @xmath23 @xmath1 observations at 2  show line widths @xmath2415  for gg  tau ( j. bary , in preparation ) , while co ro - vibrational emission toward ab  aur is unresolved at 12  ( g. blake , in preparation ) .",
    "although the relationship between these tracers and the pure rotational  emission depends in detail upon the excitation mechanism , these observations show that our assumption of 30  line widths when calculating mass upper limits is likely conservative . as a fiducial point , the projected keplerian velocity at a distance of 1 au around gg  tau aa ( m = 0.8 m@xmath25 ; white et al .",
    "1999 ) and assuming any circumstellar disk has the same orientation as the more extended circumbinary ring ( inclination @xmath26 ) , would be v=16  . for ab aur , taking m=2.4 m@xmath25 ( van den ancker et al .",
    "1998 ) and inclination @xmath27 ( grady et al . 1999 ) , the projected keplerian velocity would be v@xmath28  . of course , emission lines broadened by keplerian rotation will generally have widths broader than their characteristic keplerian velocity .",
    "although texes is a relatively new instrument , we feel reasonably confident in our results .",
    "the successful detection of continuum emission from each source at levels consistent with past observations means we were pointed at the source and that our flux determinations are not dramatically in error .",
    "we have detected  rotational emission in sources such as uranus ( l. trafton , private communication ) and ngc 7027 ( h. dinerstein , in preparation ) .",
    "the iso detections are the result of special data processing and are near the sensitivity limit ( thi et al .",
    "2001b ) . because the iso reports of molecular gas reservoirs around main - sequence stars such as @xmath29  pic ( thi et al .",
    "2001a ) have such important ramifications for our understanding of planetary formation , the current non - detections in pre - main - sequence disk sources strongly argue for follow - up observations of the main - sequence stars observed by iso , all of which are reported to be `` medium confidence '' detections .",
    "follow - up observations are particularly needed for the well studied source @xmath29  pic , where fuse observations detect no  absorption through the edge - on disk against a stellar o  vi emission line ( lecavelier des etangs et al .",
    "2001 ) and where na  i emission shows a gas disk that seems to coexist with the well known dust disk ( olofsson , liseau , & brandeker 2001 ; heap et al .",
    "2000 )    in the disk sources we observed , the absence of  emission certainly does not mean there is no warm . where the dust in the disk is optically thick , an emission line would result only if there is spatial and/or temperature separation between the dust and , such as a gap in the dust disk or a hot layer above the optically thick disk ( dalessio et al .",
    "1998 ; chiang &  goldreich 1997 ) gaps are believed to be present in gg  tau  and gw  ori   ( guilloteau et al . 1999 ; mathieu , adams , & latham 1991 ) ; for these sources , the mass upper limits constrain the gas within the gap . in general , our observations argue , albeit weakly , for little spatial separation or temperature differentiation between the bulk of the  gas and dust .    as described in section",
    "[ sec : res ] , the 12  spectrum of ab  aur has a 2@xmath3 bump at the correct velocity for the @xmath2 line and with a reasonable width . when taken with the 3@xmath3 upper - limit on @xmath1 emission from this source , 3.3  @xmath21  , the @xmath2 line flux of 2.0  @xmath30   ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) implies t@xmath33 380  k ( 275  k , 500  k ) , assuming no differential extinction . this is warmer than the 140  k seen in co ro - vibrational lines ( g. blake , in preparation ) . for simple thermal emission",
    ", we would expect the  pure rotational lines to come from cooler regions than co ro - vibrational emission , although 140  k gas would not collisionally excite ro - vibrational co emission .",
    "the 3@xmath3 upper - limit on @xmath34 line flux as observed with iso , 0.4  @xmath21  , ( thi et al .",
    "2001b ) combined with the possible @xmath2 detection ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) suggest t@xmath24190  k ( 220  k , 170  k ) . given the errors and the resulting inconsistency , we consider the ab  aur spectrum to give an upper limit to the @xmath2 integrated line flux of 4.0  @xmath6  10@xmath35  . as well as reobserving the @xmath1 and @xmath2 lines , ground - based observations of the @xmath8 line at 8  , which should be quite strong",
    "if the gas is truly at 380  k , would help determine if the @xmath2 is actually as strong as it appears .    while the next infrared satellites will have exceptional mid - infrared sensitivity",
    ", they may not be able to detect low line - to - continuum ratio features such as may be present in the ab aur 12  data .",
    "if ab aur were observed at r=600 , the maximum resolution available with the sirtf infrared spectrograph ( roellig et al . 1998 ) , a snr of @xmath161000 would give a 3@xmath3 detection of our derived line flux .",
    "the recommended mid - infrared imager / spectrograph for ngst , with r=1500 ( mather &  stockman 2000 ) , would require snr of 450 for a 3@xmath3 detection .",
    "higher spectral resolution on ngst , still a design goal , would dramatically ease this type of observation .",
    "future ground - based observations with 8 - 10 m class telescopes and high resolution spectrographs such as texes will improve on the sensitivity described here by an order of magnitude ( a factor of 100 in time ) .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have attempted to confirm several reports of pure - rotational emission from young circumstellar disks without success .",
    "our observations generally set more stringent limits on gas within @xmath3650  au of the source and with widths @xmath3750  than obtained with iso .",
    "we have found possible ( 2@xmath3 ) emission from one source , ab  aur , although inconsistencies in derived gas temperatures lead us to consider the result as an upper limit .",
    "the absence of emission suggests the gas and dust have little segregation in temperature and/or spatial extent , although more observations are necessary .",
    "we have shown that ground - based , high - resolution spectroscopy is an effective way to search for narrow , pure rotational  line emission such as that expected from circumstellar disks .",
    "we are happy to acknowledge the day and night staff at the irtf ; without their hard work , none of this observing would be possible .",
