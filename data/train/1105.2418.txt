    "the experimental progress in the field of ultracold atoms in periodic lattices  @xcite allowed for a direct observation of quantum phase transitions .",
    "a very prominent example is the experiment by greiner et al .",
    "@xcite , where the mott insulator - superfluid  @xcite phase transition of ultracold rubidium atoms trapped in a three - dimensional optical lattice has been observed .",
    "this phase transition is driven by two counteracting factors .",
    "on the one hand there is a repulsive interaction between particles on the same lattice site , trying to minimize the particle number fluctuation per site and on the other hand there is a gain of kinetic energy whenever a particle tunnels from one site to another .",
    "consider a condensate of ultracold atoms in a mott insulator phase , i.e. every lattice site is occupied by the same number of particles .",
    "one can then drive a phase transition to the superfluid phase , where the wave functions of the particles are no longer localized , by gradually decreasing the intensity of the lattice forming laser beams .",
    "because of this tunability of the experimental system  @xcite it provides a great testing ground for various quantum many body theories .",
    "two such theoretical models are the bose - hubbard ( bh ) and the jaynes - cummings lattice ( jcl ) model .",
    "while the bh model considers the competing interaction of kinetic and potential energy of bosons explained above  @xcite , the jcl model takes this thought further and also factors in the interaction of bosons with a two level atomic system .",
    "it therefore constitutes a pure quantum transcription of the semi - classical rabi model .",
    "strong coupling approaches have already been used to study the bh model in great detail  @xcite . in this work we treated bh and jc systems with a diagrammatic approach to the perturbation theory based on the kato - bloch expansion as suggested by eckhard et al .",
    "@xcite and already applied to the ordered bh model by teichmann  et  al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we extended the strong coupling kato - bloch approach to deal with disordered bh systems and the jcl model with additional degrees of freedom per unit cell .",
    "in addition , we give details for an efficient numerical computation of the strong coupling diagrams and also outline the limitations and possible pitfalls of this approach . +",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the first part deals with the bh model . in",
    "we are going to introduce the bh model in more mathematical detail .",
    "then goes on to explain how the kato formalism can be incorporated to calculate corrections to the ground state energy . after this introduction we are going to discuss how this approach can be turned into numerical algorithms in",
    "+ then shows a comparison of results calculated with the strong coupling approach with data obtained with the variational cluster approach ( vca )  @xcite . in",
    "we are going to discuss the mott insulator - superfluid phase transition , how the phase boundary can be detected and which changes have to be applied to the present algorithms .",
    "[ subsec : bh_ms_results ] contains the results we obtained and also a discussion of the problems one encounters when trying to determine the phase boundary for a one - dimensional system within this approach . in",
    "we offer a workaround for this problem and show a comparison of our data with results obtained with a density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) approach by khner et al .",
    "@xcite . explains how disordered bh systems can be treated with kato - bloch approach .",
    "+ in the second part of this work we are going to deal with the jcl model . in we will offer a very short introduction to the jc - model and then outlines the numerical transcription and what has to be changed in comparison to the bh implementation .",
    "the obtained results are shown in , where we compare the energies of various systems for different occupation numbers and dimensions .",
    "additionally we compare data from the kato - bloch approach with results obtained with vca  @xcite .",
    "the calculation of the mott insulator - superfluid phase transition is explained in .",
    "+ we conclude this work in with a summary of the obtained results , insights and a short outlook .",
    "the bose - hubbard model is used to describe bosonic particles in a lattice at very low temperatures  @xcite and has been treated with many different methods , including the mean - field method  @xcite , strong - coupling approaches  @xcite , dmrg  @xcite and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods  @xcite .",
    "a particularly efficient strong coupling approach , based on the kato - bloch perturbation theory , has been used by teichmann et al .  @xcite . in the following we will present in short all the definitions necessary to understand the subsequent equations . for a more detailed description the reader",
    "is referred to the above mentioned works .",
    "the bh hamiltonian @xmath0 , which we split into two terms suitable for strong coupling perturbation theory , reads @xmath1    @xmath2 describs the atomic limit , while @xmath3 covers the hopping processes .",
    "@xmath4 stands for the strength of the local coulomb interaction , @xmath5 represents the chemical potential in the grand canonical ensemble , @xmath6 gives the strength of the disorder on site @xmath7 , @xmath8 is the particle number operator and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the well known bosonic annihilation and creation operators .",
    "the indices label the sites of the lattice .",
    "the sums in @xmath2 run over all lattice sites , while the sum in @xmath3 runs over all directed bonds ( dibonds ) @xmath11 of nearest neighbour sites , i.e.:@xmath12    to begin with , we consider a homogeneous system @xmath13 .",
    "disorder can easily be accounted for in a second step as shown in .",
    "energies will be expressed in units of @xmath4 .",
    "the eigenvectors of @xmath2 are occupation number tensor products @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for the total number of sites and the number of bosons at site @xmath7 is given by the integer @xmath16 .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalues are @xmath17 the ground state of @xmath18 is denoted by @xmath19 , where each site is occupied by the same number of bosons , @xmath20 , which is determined by minimizing @xmath21 for a given value of the chemical potential , leading to a ground state energy @xmath22 .",
    "in order to calculate the ground state energy in strong coupling perturbation theory , we make use of the kato - bloch formalism  @xcite , which yields closed expressions for every order of the perturbation , in contrast to standard schrdinger - rayleigh perturbation theory . the strong coupling kato - bloch approach is described in great detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here we summarize the key points of the formalism necessary to understand the generalization towards disordered systems and the jcl hamiltonian .",
    "in addition we will present a different perspective that allows to exploit graph theoretical techniques in order to speed up the algorithmic implementation . in the form presented in the current section ,",
    "the kato - bloch perturbation theory is only applicable to a non - degenerate ground state , but we will lift that constraint in . +",
    "the @xmath23 order correction for the ground state can be written as @xmath24 where the sum runs over all sets of non - negative integers @xmath25 , which satisfy the following conditions  @xcite @xmath26 the operators @xmath27 are diagonal in the occupation - number basis @xmath28 eventually , the total energy correction can be expressed as a series in powers of the perturbation strength  @xmath29 with expansion coefficients @xmath30 @xmath31      next we will map the evaluation of onto a graphical problem . for simplicity",
    "we consider simple cubic lattices in @xmath32 dimensions .",
    "the generalization to other lattices is fairly straight forward .",
    "we start out from a finite cubic lattice with @xmath15 lattice sites enumerated in some suitable way and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the energy per site is computed for the thermodynamic limit , @xmath33 .",
    "we consider for a specific order @xmath34 and sequence @xmath35 . from the @xmath34 factors",
    "@xmath36 we obtain a multiple sum over dibonds @xmath37    there are two important aspects worth noting .",
    "firstly , the application of any of the dibond hopping operators @xmath38 on an occupation - number basis vector results in just another such basis vector @xmath39 secondly , as the operators @xmath27 are diagonal in the occupation number basis they merely introduce weight factors .",
    "hence , the index @xmath40 of the dibond operators @xmath41 defines an auxiliary time and @xmath42 can be any of the @xmath43 dibonds on the d - dimensional simple cubic lattice .",
    "each of the individual dibond hopping processes can be depicted as a directed line ( vector ) on the underlying lattice , connecting neighbouring sites ( see for example ) .",
    "the resulting pattern of arrows can be considered as a labelled digraph  @xcite .",
    "so far , the sum over dibonds in can be replaced by a sum over all labeled digraphs @xmath44 , consisting of directed nearest neighbour lines .",
    "such a digraph covers a certain set of lattice sites , which in ordered form be @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the number of vertices of the digraph . due to the homogeneity of the lattice we can renumber the lattice sites in sequential order without changing the resulting matrix elements in .",
    "@xmath47 the digraph defines a set @xmath48 of dibonds , but not the order in which they occur in .",
    "therefore , in addition to the sum over all digraphs @xmath44 with @xmath34 directed lines , we have to sum over all distinct sequences of dibond operators occurring in @xmath44 .",
    "two such distinct sequences of the same digraph are depicted in .",
    "obviously , multiple dibonds are indistinguishable and need not be permuted .    for each dibond sequence @xmath49 ,",
    "we compute the corresponding matrix elements ( weights of the digraph ) @xmath50 where , due to the tensor structure of the vectors and the structure of the operators , only the sites @xmath51 are involved .",
    "an immediate consequence is that the weight of all isomorphic digraphs is the same .",
    "since the computation of the matrix elements is the most cpu - time consuming step , it is expedient to represent the digraphs by topologically different members and the corresponding multiplicities .",
    "one class of isomorphism is due to translational invariance .",
    "each digraph , apart from the lattice - site labels , occurs in @xmath15 copies on the lattice with periodic boundary conditions , which results in an overall factor @xmath15 . in order to avoid the computation of @xmath15 identical contributions",
    ", we compute the energy per site , by restricting the sum over all digraphs to those attached to the origin .",
    "graphs attached to the origin shall be defined by the condition @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the position of the @xmath7-th site on the underlying lattice , covered by the digraph .      yet",
    "not all digraphs contribute to the energy .",
    "there are two constraints for non - zero contributions .",
    "firstly , the number of dibonds entering a site has to balance the number of dibonds leaving it ( _ local particle conservation rule _ ) . in graph - theory language",
    "the digraph is said to be balanced and consequently it has no sources or sinks , i.e. sites with only one dibond attached to it .",
    "a second constraint is due to the linked cluster theorem . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein , contributions of disconnected graphs cancel .",
    "a simple argument is given by the extensivity of the energy which has to be proportional to @xmath15 .",
    "disconnected graphs yield higher orders in @xmath15 , since each disconnected part can be placed roughly speaking on @xmath15 different sites .    in summary ,",
    "admissible digraphs are connected and balanced . from graph theory",
    "it is known  @xcite that such graphs are eulerian , i.e. they can be traversed along the directed lines by visiting each directed line exactly once .",
    "this very feature will be used to generate all digraphs .",
    "examples of several low - order diagrams are given in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "here we give an algorithm to generate the topologically different , connected and balanced digraphs on a simple cubic lattice .",
    "we start at the origin of the lattice and generate an eulerian circuit of length @xmath34 by tracing a tour sequentially to neighbouring sites . at every site",
    "there are @xmath54 choices to proceed .",
    "the problem is equivalent to searching in trees and we applied a depth - first search algorithm up to depth @xmath34 .",
    "if we return to the origin after these @xmath34 steps , the corresponding path is shifted such that it fulfills and is added to a list .",
    "multiple entries of the same path are discarded .",
    "the same path can occur several times , as we can consider any site of the path as origin , from which the path is initiated .",
    "this multiplicity is an artifact of the algorithm and has to be eliminated .",
    "next we need to identify topologically different digraphs .",
    "digraphs are isomorphic if and only if for some ordering of their vertices , their adjacency matrices  @xcite are equal .",
    "let @xmath55 be the sequence of site - indices encountered during the tour .",
    "the adjacency matrix , which includes the information which sites of a graph are connected with each other , can be computed in the following way @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the number of times the path goes from site @xmath7 to site @xmath58 or in other words , the number of dibonds from site @xmath7 to site @xmath58 .",
    "two digraphs are isomorphic if and only if the corresponding matrices are similar @xmath59 with @xmath60 being a permutation matrix  @xcite .",
    "provided two graphs are isomorphic , trace and determinant of @xmath61 and @xmath62 for any integer power @xmath63 have to agree .",
    "this can be used as a quick tests to rule out isomorphism .",
    "a representative example of two digraphs that pass all these tests is depicted in  .    .",
    "the generating paths are attached to the origin.,title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "the generating paths are attached to the origin.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the corresponding adjacency matrix of the left digraph is @xmath64 and the adjacency matrix of the right digraph reads @xmath65 at first glance , the two matrices seem to be different , but the distinction stems from the labeling .",
    "if we denote by @xmath60 the matrix associated with the permutation @xmath66 then we can easily verify the similarity of @xmath67 and @xmath68 @xmath69 this algorithm then generates a list of unlabeled ( topologically different ) digraphs , along with their multiplicities .      in order to evaluate the energy correction per site of we",
    "have to go through all digraphs in the list , compute their contribution to the matrix element and multiply it by the multiplicity .",
    "the contribution of one digraph is determined in the following way .",
    "the digraph @xmath44 defines a set of dibond operators .",
    "we attach auxiliary times @xmath70 to the dibond operators in all possible but distinguishable ways .",
    "each time sequence @xmath71 defines an additive contribution to .",

    "the solid ( blue ) line contains only the second order energy correction @xmath75 , the dashed ( red ) line results from combining the second order and fourth order corrections , the dashed - dotted ( green ) line shows the energy correction up to sixth order and the dotted ( black ) line up to the eighth order .",

    "in fact , the lines for the @xmath76 and @xmath77 order lie on top of each other perfectly at this scale , suggesting a very high fidelity already for the sixth order correction .    additionally , shows a comparison of data computed with vca  @xcite .",

    "]    the solid and the dashed lines represent the results obtained with the kato - bloch approach and the from vca . as previously with the bh system ( see in ) , our results are in excellent agreement with vca .",

    "and dimensions @xmath32 as a function of the hopping strength @xmath29 . ]    based on the numerical results , it appears that the energies depend stronger on the filling factor @xmath20 than on the physical dimension @xmath32 .",
    "the same changes in the algorithm that have been discussed in the previous chapter have also to be taken into account if one wants to determine the mott insulator - superfluid phase boundary for the jcl model .",
    "but furthermore it is no longer necessarily true that the number of bonds pointing to a site is the same as the number of bonds pointing away from it .",
    "this little inconvenience is taken care of by just computing the sum along the rows and the sum along the columns of the adjacency matrix and adding these vectors point - wise , thereby getting the number of bonds per site . in the mott insulator - superfluid phase boundary",
    "is shown for @xmath79 and @xmath82 and different filling factors .",
    "left to the depicted lines , the system is in the mott phase .     and @xmath82 .",
    "the detuning is zero @xmath72 .",
    "the filling factors for the three mott lobes are @xmath83 from the bottom to top . ]",
    "the phase boundary @xmath84 for @xmath85 is independent of the dimension of the system as it is determined by a single site .",
    "it can be calculated easily , resulting in @xmath86 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . this a comparison with the result for the bh model , where @xmath87 , reveals that the effective hubbard interaction @xmath4 in the jaynes - cummings model depends on the filling fractions .",
    "this explains , why the mott lobes in the jc model decrease rapidly with filling fraction .    as was the case with the bh model , the phase boundary for 1-dimensional systems",
    "has to be calculated by the use of defect particles already explained in .",
    "in this work we have employed the kato - bloch perturbation approach to calculate the ground state energies and boundaries of the mott - insulator phase , both for various bose - hubbard and the jaynes - cummings lattice systems .",
    "the kato - bloch approach leads to explicit formulas for any perturbation order , i.e. there is a clear distinction of the orders in contrast to the mixed expressions in the schrdinger - rayleigh perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , all the appearing expressions can be represented diagrammatically , which allows to utilize knowledge from graph theory to speed up the numerical algorithms considerably .",
    "in fact we were able to perform all calculations on an off - the - shelf computer using matlab in appropriate time .    additionally to these advantages ,",
    "the comparison of our results with those from other methods , including dmrg and vca prove the high accuracy of our implementation .    building upon the work by teichmann et al .",
    "@xcite , who determined the ground state energy , the boundary of the mott - insulator phase and various other quantities for the bh system in detail , we focused on adding disorder to the bh model , applying this approach to the jcl model and on solving the problem that appears when trying to calculate the phase boundary for 1-dimensional systems with the method of effective potential .",
    "the kato - bloch approach is an extremely powerful method and could be easily generalized to deal with other lattice systems apart from the bh and the jcl as well . especially interesting in our eyes would be the implementation of models with nearest neighbour interaction or an additional superlattice structure , which exhibit a richer phase diagram as the bh and the jcl model .",
