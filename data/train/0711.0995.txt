    "we consider a system of @xmath0 two - level atoms ( tla ) and represent them by the algebra of spin one - half particles with total angular momentum @xmath1 with @xmath2 .",
    "hence , we refer to the system as a system of @xmath0 spins or tla .",
    "we start with the system in a coherent state [ 1 ] @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a complex number given by @xmath5 @xmath6 represents the state with all the atoms in the upper of the two states ( spin - up ) .",
    "the coherent state satisfies the equality sign in the uncertainty relation for the components of ` angular momentum ' in a plane normal to the mean - spin vector @xmath7 with equal amount of noise in its two quadratures .",
    "the mean - spin vector has the magnitude @xmath8 in other words , in a frame in which @xmath7 is along an axis ( @xmath9 say ) , the minimum uncertainty condition is satisfied by the state described by eq .",

    "@xmath10 where @xmath11 are the variances in the two quadratures .",
    "if in such a frame the condition @xmath12 is satisfied in some state of the system , then we shall say that the atomic system is spin squeezed .",
    "+ model hamiltonians through which spin squeezed states could be realised were proposed by kitagawa and ueda [ 2 ] and others [ 3 ] . since then , it has been vigorously studied in various atom - field systems [ 4 - 12 ] .",
    "when a tla interacts with a squeezed radiation field , squeezing can be transferred from the field to the atomic system [ 4 ] .",
    "self squeezing of the spin system is possible if it is adequately nonlinear in its interaction with the radiation field [ 5 ] .",
    "the well - known tavis - cummings model also exhibits spin squeezing [ 6 ] .",
    "its importance has been enhanced further due to its potential application in the area of quantum information [ 7 - 10 ] .",
    "+ we have been studying various quantum mechanical operators , rather nonlinear in spin operators , capable of producing spin squeezed states when applied to a tla . in ref .",
    "[ 11 ] , spin squeezing properties of a pseudo - hermitian operator @xmath13 with real @xmath14 have been studied .",
    "the operator @xmath15 has the features of pseudo - hermicity as @xmath16 but yet @xmath17 where @xmath18 is linear invertible hermitian operator .",

    "this operator is of interest in the study of a tla interacting with a squeezed vacuum [ 4 ] .",
    "studies in [ 2 , 12 ] reveal that with a hamiltonian quadratic in the spin operator @xmath21 , that is , @xmath22 ( where @xmath23 is a constant characteristics of the system ) the corresponding evolution operator @xmath24 when applied to a spin coherent state in eq .",
    "( 1 ) produces spin squeezing in the tla .",
    "this operator can describe the interaction of a tla with radiation field in a high - q dispersive cavity [ 13 ] .",
    "this operator is also a special case of the so - called lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) hamiltonian for a many - body fermionic system [ 14 ] .",
    "+ in this paper we identify the quadratic atomic ( spin ) operator which can introduce a squeeze from an analogy between the spin and bosonic systems .",
    "we do so in sec .",
    "ii and study its squeezing properties in the following sections . in sec .",
    "iii , we give analytical results for a two - atom system which provide some insight into the properties of the proposed operator .",
    "the numerical results for @xmath25 are discussed in the sec .",
    "we conclude the paper in sec .",
    "v with a comment on possible realization of such operators in some physical systems .",
    "we begin with the derivation of a displacement operator for the spin coherent state in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . this can be achieved if we cast the state @xmath26 in the schwinger representation [ 15 ] .",
    "the spin operators in the schwinger representation are constructed by defining bosonic annihilation operators for two modes @xmath27 such that @xmath28=\\delta_{ij}$ ] and @xmath29=0=[a_{i}^\\dagger , a_{j}^\\dagger]$ ] .",
    "they take the forms @xmath30 , @xmath31/2 $ ] , etc .",
    "the spin coherent state @xmath26 takes the form @xmath32 where @xmath33 are vacuum ( fictitious ) states for @xmath34 and @xmath35 modes . comparing this form of the spin coherent state with the glauber - sudarshan coherent state for bosonic particles [ 16 ] @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the well - known displacement operator @xmath38 it",
    "may be said that @xmath39 via the schwinger construction is a ` displacement ' operator for spin systems .",
    "+ the above analogy between glauber - sudarshan coherent states and the spin coherent states suggest that one may attemp to obtain spin squeezed states in a manner similar to that employed for the bosonic case .",
    "thus a quadratic form of the generators @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the heisenberg - weyl algebra was used to set up the operators which when acting on the glauber - sudarshan coherent states resulted in the squeezed states , viz , taking a cue from [ 17 ] , @xmath42 .\\ ] ] likewise , for the atomic or ( pseudo)-spin coherent states it is tempting to consider exponentiation of the quadratic form constructed out of the generator @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath21 of the rotation group . consider the most general such form , namely , @xmath45 where @xmath46 run from @xmath47 .",
    "note that @xmath48 transforms like a vector operator ( in the 3-dimentional representation ) under rotation and accordingly @xmath49 is a tensor of the second rank .",
    "however , this may be reduced in the following manner @xmath50 \\nonumber \\\\             & + & \\big[(\\frac{1}{2}(j_{l}j_{k}-j_{k}j_{l})\\big]+\\big[\\frac{1}{3}\\delta_{lk}j^2\\big ] \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first term in square brackets being the components of a traceless symmetric second rank tensor ( with five independent components ) , the second being the components of the antisymmetric second rank tensor which by virtue of the commutation relation @xmath51=i\\epsilon_{lks}j_s$ ] is expressed in terms of the vector representation and the last term in square backets is a scalar @xmath52 .",
    "this is tentamount to the reduction of the direct product of two vectors @xmath53 thus the exponentiation in @xmath54 being quadratic in the generation of the rotation group can be decomposed into the sum of three operators with the trace @xmath55 yielding a mere overall phase , the antisymmetric form in the exponent just a rotation , and the quadratic form in a exponent yielding the non - trivial squeeze . since the different components of the quadrupole tensor are related via rotations we can in effect express the squeezing operator in the case of the spin system choosing , for example , the fiducial quadratic forms @xmath56     \\nonumber \\\\",
    "s^{\\prime}_{spin}&=&\\exp[\\eta j_{z}^2]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus @xmath57 can represent time evolution of a state vector under the action of a hamiltonian @xmath58\\ ] ] where @xmath59 .",
    "+ indeed , @xmath60 is connected to other quadratic combinations of spin operators , viz , @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] by mere rotations .",
    "similarly , @xmath63 in eq .",
    "6 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are related to one another by simple rotations .",
    "thus the operators in eq .",
    "( 11 ) can be taken to be the representatives of interaction hamiltonians having quadratic forms of spin operators .",
    "kitagawa and ueda [ 2 ] has shown that the operator @xmath66 in eq . (",
    "11 ) produces spin squeezing resulting from a single - axis twisting and the operator @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( 11 ) or the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( 12 ) can give rise to spin squeezing resulting from two - axis counter twisting .",
    "we , however , present a detail account of this operator and show that a large number of atoms ( spins ) can be squeezed .",
    "we also point out the possibilities of its physical realization .",
    "12 we have already studied the spin squeezing dynamics of @xmath66 .",
    "what follows is a discussion on spin squeezing properties of the operator @xmath57 .",
    "+ we can write @xmath67 and @xmath68 in the schwinger representation and proceed to examine the spin squeezing properties when operated upon a spin coherent state .",
    "this may produce a spin squeezed state @xmath69 in the lines of yuen s representation for a bosonic squeezed state [ 17 ] .",
    "however , this method gets very complicated and , so , we investigate the squeezing properties of @xmath57 as follows . + we assume that the operator acts on a system of atoms prepared initially in a coherent state @xmath70 .",
    "this can be achieved by sending the atoms through a cavity whose single - mode is maintained by the radiation from a laser .",
    "the polar angle @xmath71 is decided by the interaction time of the atoms with the cavity field .",
    "we first consider the action of @xmath57 on a two - atom coherent state as it gives analytical results . with",
    "the insight gained from these results , we go ahead with the numerical analysis of squeezing properties of @xmath57 acting on a system having more than two atom . +",
    "in addition to this being the first step of our general study , the bipartite system is of special interest in the study of quantum entanglement [ 7 - 10 ] .",
    "+ the initial state of the system , the coherent state , is in this case given by @xmath72\\ ] ] which is a linear superposition of the three wigner state with @xmath73 .",
    "the action of @xmath57 on the @xmath74 changes the amplitudes of the wigner states giving @xmath75 where @xmath76,\\ ] ] @xmath77 and @xmath78.\\ ] ]    it has been shown in [ 18 ] that this state radiates squeezed light [ 17 ] , thus , indicating strongly that the collective two - atom state is spin squeezed [ 5 ] .",
    "however , its spin squeezing properties , as it is known by now [ 2 - 12 ] and defined in eq.(4 ) , have not been discussed there .",
    "we present them below .",
    "it is straightforward to calculate the moments and correlation functions of the spin operators .",
    "we find that all the three correlation functions , namely @xmath79 , @xmath80 and @xmath81 are nonzero and for real @xmath4 and @xmath18 one of them , @xmath80 , survives .",
    "this indicates the squeezing capabilities of @xmath57 for all possible values of @xmath4 and @xmath18 .",
    "this is due to the fact that nonzero values of correlation function ( at least one ) is a necessity for spin squeezing to take place [ 2,11 ] .",
    "the variances in the two quadratures , namely @xmath82 and @xmath83 , in the rotated frame as defined in eqs .",
    "( 2 - 4 ) are given by @xmath84\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath85 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in eq .",
    "( 15 ) , the presence of @xmath86 in the denominator is due to the rotation required to bring @xmath87 along the required direction , here , @xmath9 axis .",
    "the mean - spin vector is given by @xmath88\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is easy to note that for @xmath89 the results reduce to that for a spin coherent state , that is , @xmath90 and @xmath91 in accordance with eqs .",
    "( 2 ) and ( 3 ) for a two - atom system .",
    "further , we notice in eqs . ( 15 ) and ( 16 ) that the arguments of all the circular functions appearing there are in the form of @xmath92 and @xmath93 . hence , the variances return to their initial condition , that is a coherent state , for @xmath94 where @xmath95 is an integer .",
    "the spin squeezing parameters @xmath96 and @xmath97 as defined in eq .",
    "( 4 ) @xmath98 has interesting relations for @xmath99 and @xmath100 : @xmath101 and @xmath102 because of the above observations it is sufficient to study the variances for @xmath103 .",
    "we display them in fig .",
    "1 and notice perfect squeezing of the two - spin system . 0.4 cm     in units of @xmath100 .",
    "note that for @xmath104 , curves are same as for @xmath99 but the @xmath96 and @xmath97 are interchanged.,width=302 ]",
    "for a system having more than two two - level atoms , it is highly complicated to get an analytical expression .",
    "however , the problem can be tackled somewhat numerically .",
    "+ we are concerned about the evolution @xmath106 where @xmath105 .",
    "quantum mechanical average of any spin operator or products of them , say @xmath107 , is given by @xmath108 the inner product @xmath109 is given by @xmath110 where we have used @xmath111 with @xmath60 being given by eq .",
    "the @xmath112 are the eigenvectors of @xmath60 with eigenvalues @xmath113 .",
    "+ the dynamics exhibit a rich variety of characteristics of spin squeezing . in fig .",
    "2 , we display @xmath114 for short interaction time , that is , @xmath115 .",
    "the striking feature there is that , for @xmath116 , @xmath114 oscillates just below the line @xmath117 indicating spin squeezing for all values of @xmath118 .",
    "thus the operator @xmath57 is capable of squeezing a large number of atoms if they are initially prepared in a coherent state such that @xmath119 .",
    "the distribution function for the initial condition @xmath116 takes the form @xmath120 where we have taken @xmath121 for simplicity .",
    "it can be easily shown that @xmath122 peaks at @xmath123 by using the expression for digamma function , the derivative of the factorial function . the state @xmath124 has the property of maximum correlation among indiviual spins [ 19 ] which is exploited by the operation @xmath57 to squeeze out noise displayed in fig .",
    "this type of behaviour has also been noticed in the spin squeezing properties of pseuo - hermitian operator discussed in ref . [ 11 ] .",
    "this striking property of the spin squeezing operator persists for longer interaction times too .",
    "0.4 cm     quadrature as a function of @xmath118 .",
    "note that there is no squeezing in the other quadrature for such interaction times.,width=302 ]    0.4 cm     quadrature as a function of @xmath125 .",

    "3 the variations in squeezing as a function of time for @xmath105 . a comparision with fig .",
    "1 indicates that the oscillations in squeezing with time increase with @xmath118 .",
    "we have shown that operators in the form of exponentian of quadratic forms of spin operators , @xmath129 have the spin squeezing properties when operated upon a spin coherent state .",
    "we have shown in fig .",
    "2 that the operator can squeeze out noise from an ensemble having a large number of spins initially prepared in a coherent state with @xmath130 and @xmath131 . as shown there , a deviation from this initial condition reduces the number of squeezed spins drastically .",
    "these results , however , would be influenced by the surrounding reservoirs which we plan to study in a later publication .",
    "+ the quadratic forms of spin operators have been discussed in the literature for quite sometime .",
    "for example , a widely discussed interaction is the so - called lipkin interaction hamiltonian [ 14 ] @xmath132 where @xmath133 and @xmath134 are the coupling constants representing the two - body interactions .",
    "indeed these two types of terms are the archetypes of the hamiltonian quadratic in the generators and related to what we expressed through eqs . (",
    "the operators in eqs . ( 11 ) are special cases of the lipkin hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath57 also appears in the hamiltonian of a complex magnetic molecule in a static magnetic field [ 20 ] . the operator @xmath66 can be realized in an optical system consisting of an ensemble of atoms in a high q dispersive cavity [ 13 ] .",
    "we have studied its behaviour in detail in ref .",
    "also , the exponent in @xmath66 describes atomic cooperation in a dicke system [ 19 ] placed inside a cavity and driven by an external laser field [ 21 ] .",
    "hence , its hamiltonian includes a term which is proportional to @xmath135 .",
