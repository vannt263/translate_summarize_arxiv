    "the spectacular results provided by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) experiment ( bennett et al . 2003 ) offer the possibility of testing the nature of the initial conditions that seeded the structure of the universe .",
    "the inflationary paradigm puts forward a convincing picture that explains the formation of the first seeds .",
    "however inflation has not been yet incorporated successfully in the framework of fundamental physics .",
    "therefore hints from observations may prove useful in discerning such an important connection .",
    "an increasing number of studies have been devoted to the initial power spectrum reconstruction , due to its potential importance .",
    "for example in @xcite ; mukherjee & wang ( 2003 ) ; mukherjee & wang ( 2005 ) a shape parametrized a priori is used .",
    "model independent methods that use so - called non parametric algorithms have also been proposed e.g. in @xcite ; leach ( 2005 ) ; sealfon et al .",
    "in @xcite we proposed a method based on regularized least squares to non - parametrically reconstruct under a general smoothing assumption the primordial power spectrum from cmb temperature data in the wave number range @xmath11 , with @xmath12 standing for the hubble constant in units of @xmath13 . here",
    "we extend the analysis to large scales by proposing the necessary modifications dictated by the non - gaussianity of the data errors caused by cosmic variance . while we fix the late - time cosmological parameters to the best fit values obtained from the combined wmap and sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) data ( tegmark et al .",
    "2004 ) , our method has the virtue of allowing an estimate of the power spectrum , at the highest resolution to date , that permits a refined local search for deviations from a scale free power spectrum . the horizon scale for the model we are considering translates into the wavenumber @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the conformal time at present .",
    "a high resolution reconstruction at large scales ( using the richardson - lucy algorithm ) has been presented previously by @xcite , that used binned data after the hexadecapole .",
    "we propose here a different deconvolution method that starts from the unbinned wmap data and provides for the first time an estimate of the errors in the reconstruction .",
    "deconvolving wmap data we find indications for the following three features that deviate from a fiducial scale free ( spectral index @xmath1 ) initial spectrum : a cut - off at @xmath16 at 79.5% ( 92% ) , a dip at @xmath4 at 87.2% ( 98% ) and a bump at @xmath5 at 90.3% ( 55.5% ) .",
    "similar features were also detected in @xcite and suggestions of a similar cutoff were also provided by @xcite .",
    "the cutoff effect is due mainly to the low large scale power at the quadrupole and to a minor extent to the octopole present in wmap data ( bennett et al .",
    "2003 ) and , since it is intriguingly present also in the cobe dmr data ( bennett et al .",
    "1996 ) , certainly deserves some consideration .",
    "we wish to emphasize that our approach is very similar in spirit to traditional image reconstruction methods and that our aim is _ not _ to search for the minimal parametric description of the power spectrum . given a dense enough discretization to closely approximate the integral in eq.([integral ] ) below",
    ", the data automatically select the degree of smoothing necessary to allow the highest resolution in the reconstructed signal compatible with the actual noise level , being the result of a tradeoff between resolution and noise filtering .",
    "strictly speaking we are using a large number of band amplitudes as parameters , however since they correspond to a dense grid in wavenumber space that translates in a good approximation of the continuum , we call our method _ non - parametric_. as will become apparent later , our method is capable of estimating simultaneously the large number of amplitude parameters .",
    "widely used multi - parameter estimation methods such as monte carlo markov chain would , in their simplest implementations , find some difficulties in evaluating hundreds of parameters .",
    "after having tested the reliability of the method through monte carlo simulations , the reconstruction can be compared with simple parametric shapes to look for local deviations , that we estimated with two types of errors , as detailed below .    in section ii",
    "we introduce in detail the method ; in section iii we show the outcome of some tests on mock data that allow us to proceed with confidence to the reconstruction from the actual wmap temperature data , our main result . we conclude with a d iscussion of our results in section iv .",
    "the problem at hand is how to estimate the primordial power spectrum @xmath17 from a cmb observational data base which is compressed into the form of the angular power spectrum , @xmath18 .",
    "we start first with a pedagogical example where the cosmic variance is neglected , a situation applicable in the large @xmath19 case .",
    "the temperature cmb angular power spectrum is related to the primordial power spectrum , @xmath17 , by a convolution with a window function that depends on the cosmological parameters : @xmath20 where the last term represents a numerical approximation to the integral obtained through a fine discretization and @xmath21 .",
    "we fix the units in the transfer function in order to express the primordial fluctuation spectrum @xmath22 , corresponding to the comoving curvature perturbation spectrum @xmath23 in @xcite , in units of @xmath24 .",
    "let us suppose that our scope is to estimate a solution for the linear problem @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cmb vector data , @xmath27 is the noise vector , characterized by zero mean and covariance matrix @xmath28 and @xmath29 is the vector of the unknowns .",
    "the cmb measurements are given by the angular power spectrum evaluated at the multipoles @xmath30 , @xmath31 is the transfer function calculated numerically with a boltzmann code such as cmbfast ( seljak & zaldarriaga 1996 ) , and @xmath29 represents the initial power spectrum , as defined above . cosmic variance is neglected here and @xmath32 is independent of @xmath29 .",
    "consider a gaussian likelihood ,    @xmath33 \\equiv \\exp \\left [ -\\frac{1}{2}s ' \\right],\\ ] ]    where we are ignoring an overall factor that does not depend on the model and eq.([eq : like ] ) is implicitly defining @xmath34 .",

    "note that the formal solution provided by eqs.([eq : xbar ] ) and ( [ eq : sigma ] ) is valid only under the assumption that @xmath32 is independent of @xmath29 .    clearly to solve the problem ,",
    "some external information must be injected in the form of a prior . in order to do this in a meaningful way",
    ", the problem must be rephrased in bayesian terms .",
    "we are interested in evaluating the probability @xmath38 of having a primordial power spectrum given the data .",
    "bayes theorem states that : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the likelihood of the data given a model for the power spectrum , @xmath41 is the prior assumed on the power spectrum and @xmath42 is the probability of having the data . in what follows",
    "we will fix the late - time cosmological parameters to the best fit values found by @xcite when they assumed a featurless power law for the initial power spectrum .",

    "eq.([eq : reg ] ) defines @xmath46 as the regularizing operator whose strength depends on @xmath45 . in other words ,",
    "the logarithm of the prior , namely the regularization function , approximates a penalty term that corresponds to the squared norm of the first derivative of the solution . after neglecting the probability of the data ,",

    "under the assumption that the covariance matrix @xmath47 does not depend on the theoretical power spectrum , the solution can be written as @xmath48^{-1 } { \\mathbfss}{w}^{t}{\\mathbfss}{n}^{-1}{\\bmath}{d},\\ ] ] with the now computable covariance matrix @xmath49^{-1}.\\ ] ] the dependence of the solution on the smoothness parameter @xmath45 appears clearly in the previous equations .",
    "it is useful to view some asymptotic limits of the solution .",
    "when the parameter @xmath45 tends to zero we are back to the first case of no prior and the solution is going to be impossible to find for the reasons exposed above .",
    "if @xmath45 is taken very large and the smoothing term dominates over the first term , the solution will be in the form that minimizes the first derivative , that is , a constant vector .",
    "clearly , a compromise is needed when the parameter @xmath45 has to be chosen .",
    "a reasonable choice is to select an @xmath45 such that @xmath50 = n_d \\ ] ] with @xmath51 representing the number of data points .",
    "in essence , this was the method adopted in our first reconstruction paper ,  @xcite , where , for high enough multipoles , cosmic variance could be considered negligible with respect to experimental noise and a gaussian shape for the likelihood of the data given a model that was a safe choice , as will also be confirmed below .",

    "were proposed in bond , jaffe , knox ( 1998 and 2000 ) . for the wmap experiment ,",
    "the likelihood is approximated in detail by the product of a lognormal and a gaussian distributions ( verde et al .",
    "2003 ) : @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "here @xmath57 the noise vector @xmath58 was computed by the wmap team ( verde et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) through calibration with monte carlo simulations .",
    "it is important to note that the matrix @xmath32 depends on the angular power spectrum @xmath59 , due to cosmic variance and in addition the galaxy cut provokes some correlation due to mode mixing .",
    "since the primordial power spectrum reconstruction on large scales is very sensitive to the quadrupole likelihood function , it is relevant to be sure that foreground contamination has been properly taken into account .",
    "there have been various post - wmap papers in which alternative methods to clean foregrounds have been presented ( e.g. in tegmark et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , efstathiou ( 2004 ) and slosar et al .",
    "( 2004 ) ) .",
    "we will discuss later the possible effects of alternative foreground removal methods .    even if in this work we chose to use the verde et al.(2003 ) likelihhood , our method can be generalised provided an analytical fit to the likelihood is given .",
    "application of bayes theorem and the requirement that the estimated power spectrum should correspond to the maximum of the _ a posteriori _ probability reduces the minimization problem to @xmath60 where @xmath61 under the constraint of @xmath62 = n_d.\\ ] ] here the covariance matrix @xmath32 has an explicit dependence on @xmath29 to account for the cosmic variance and @xmath51 equal to 899 , the number of wmap temperature data points .",
    "the minimization of @xmath63 can not be solved analytically , due to the non - gaussianity of the likelihood function , therefore a numerical method should be used ; we found the iterative newton - raphson method suitable for our purpose .",
    "the @xmath64-th iteration of the method is decribed by : @xmath65 in which @xmath66 stands for the solution @xmath67-th component relative to the @xmath68-th iteration .",
    "here we have the following partial derivative :    @xmath69 it is intended that in the last equation @xmath70 at each iteration .",
    "furthermore the last two terms were found taking into account the derivative of the covariance matrix @xmath71 , assumed , just for these terms , to be diagonal and with diagonal elements given by : @xmath72 in which @xmath73 is the effective fraction of the sky computed by the wmap team ( verde et al .",
    "( 2003 ) ) .",
    "furthermore we have approximated the hessian matrix with : @xmath74 where we neglected difference terms that do not substantially alter the final result and may induce numerical instabilities . at the @xmath75-th iteration step the covariance matrix",
    "is evaluated at @xmath76 .",
    "eq.([eq : ser ] ) is solved for an assumed value of @xmath45 , upon convergence the value of @xmath45 is updated and the whole procedure is repeated until the two equations are both satisfied .      with the iterative procedure we can identify the maximum of the a posteriori distribution of the power spectrum . given the maximum and considering small deviations around the maximum , then the distribution function can be approximated as gaussian and can be fully defined by the error covariance matrix . to estimate the statistical significance of the estimated power spectrum we define two types of errors .    according to the bayesian method , the covariance matrix that describes the scatter of the true @xmath29 around its estimator , @xmath77 is given by : @xmath78^{-1}.\\ ] ] note that @xmath79 provides an estimate of the deviation of the true @xmath29 from its estimator , and it is referred to as an error of type i.    alternatively , one can ask for another measure of the scatter , this time of frequentist nature .",
    "let us assume for a moment that the likelihood of the data is gaussian and that the estimator can be expressed as : @xmath80 with @xmath81^{-1 } { \\mathbfss}{w}^{t}{\\mathbfss}{n}^{-1}.\\ ] ] suppose that an ensemble of observers is measuring the same realization of the primordial power spectrum @xmath29 , and that each observer measures and estimates it in the same way .",
    "it is clear that the ensemble averaged value of the estimated @xmath29 is given by : @xmath82 the variance of the scatter of the estimated @xmath29 from its ensemble average is defined here as an error of type ii , and is given by : @xmath83 in other words , @xmath84 gives the scatter in the estimator of @xmath29 around its mean value for a given realization .",
    "this corresponds to using the estimator of @xmath29 as a surrogate for the true model and to employing synthetic data built around it to study the distribution of the errors .",
    "suppose that the estimation method used here , represented by the matrix @xmath85 , does not introduce any bias in @xmath29 , then it follows that @xmath84 provides a measure of how much @xmath77 deviates from the true value .",
    "it will be shown that the bias is almost negligible for the very smooth concordance theoretical spectra and that the criterion in eq.([eq : snd ] ) tends to oversmooth the predicted signal .",
    "consequently @xmath84 presents a lower limit on the scatter of the estimated @xmath29 from its theoretically expected shape .    in the next section ,",
    "monte carlo simulations generated around the concordance initial spectrum are used to show that in the general non - gaussian wmap likelihood case , practically no bias is present and that the covariance matrix computed from the _ a posteriori _ distribution of the deconvolved samples is almost identical to @xmath84 , as expected from error propagation . furthermore the distribution very closely follows a gaussian .",
    "the smoothing prior necessarily induces a bias , that is caused by the matrix ( @xmath86 ) being different with respect to unity . in other words , the deconvolved power spectrum , even in absence of noise , is inevitably going to be a smoothed version of the true spectrum .",
    "however the actual concordance model power spectra are predicted by the simplest inflation scenarios and are given by very smooth shapes , namely a power law with an exponent @xmath87 very close to 1 , that result in a very flat combination @xmath88 .",
    "therefore a smoothing prior seems reasonable both on theoretical grounds ( since it is in line with inflationary predictions ) and for practical purposes ( since it offers an effective way to extract informations given the limitations posed by the width of the transfer function kernel ) .",
    "remarkably , for extremely flat configurations the bias caused by the smoothing prior adopted in our method can be considered nearly negligible .",
    "indeed this is what we have found in the monte carlo tests explained in the next section , where we considered two power law spectra with @xmath89 and 0.97 .",
    "the fact that the method has nearly negligible bias for configurations close to the concordance model has led us to consider an extremely effective null hypothesis test that consists of the following steps :    * the null hypothesis is chosen to be given , in turn , by the two initial spectra with @xmath89 and 0.97 ; * the cmb angular power spectra are computed from the initial spectra and from them random deviates are drawn to get synthetic data ; * each of the monte carlo realizations are used as starting points for the reconstruction method and the deconvolved solutions are utilised to sample the a posteriori distribution of the initial spectrum around the null hypothesis ; * the reconstruction from wmap data is compared with the a posteriori distribution and if strong deviations are found , then the null test is considered to have failed .",
    "we remark that if the real primordial spectrum has deviations from a smooth shape , the bias introduced by the method will tend to conservatively underestimate them .",
    "it is useful to mention that the errors of type ii built around the null hypothesis spectra are expected to be equivalent to the errors that result from the scatter of a large number of monte carlo realizations , and indeed this is what we have observed .",
    "as specified in the next section , to quantify the probability of how likely the null hypothesis is followed in pre - defined wavenumber ranges , we have integrated over the distribution described by the monte carlo samples . clearly , all these considerations require that the important systematics have been removed from the data ; a discussion on this delicate issue is presented in the next section .",
    "since the numerical computations are rather intensive , we fixed the late - time cosmological parameters to the best - fit values found combining wmap temperature and sdss data  @xcite : for the baryonic and matter fractions , @xmath90 and @xmath91 ; the hubble constant in units of @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "the optical depth was fixed to @xmath94 , as suggested by the wmap temperature and cross correlated temperature - polarization data , when the power spectrum is described by a power law with spectral index close to unity ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the range over which the transfer functions are integrated is typically between @xmath95 and @xmath96 , discretised in approximately 500 bins .",
    "this choice corresponds approximatively to a marginalization if the precise question we are answering is whether there are deviations from a power law spectrum with spectral index close to @xmath1 , that was found in the best fit of @xcite , while assuming a power spectrum defined as a power law with the spectral index as a free parameter . in other words ,",
    "the method can be thought of as a consistency test for the concordance model with a power law power spectrum , since by fixing the cosmological parameters in this way , we should expect to find a power spectrum at least compatible with a power law of @xmath97 with @xmath1 . under these conditions",
    "the prior will tend to push the reconstruction towards the above power law , if it represents the true underlying signal . while if departures from featureless initial conditions are found with enough statistical significance , they may be due to a real signal or just to residual systematics still present in the data .",
    "we have also implemented the analysis with a spectral index @xmath89 to look for deviations from a scale free spectrum .",
    "as anticipated , an additional safety net is offered by the method : if large enough deviations truly exist , the estimate obtained with the smoothing criterion in eq.([eq : snd ] ) will in general tend to underestimate the signal by furnishing an oversmoothed solution .",
    "this is a clear result of the prior bias that we have verified with a series of tests and is also deducible from a computation of the effective number of degrees of freedom caused by smoothing .",
    "these are defined , as in @xcite , by the trace of the matrix ( wm ) in analogy with ordinary regression and amount to about 52 for the wmap reconstruction .",
    "eq.([eq : snd ] ) should therefore be considered a rather conservative choice .    to verify the method we performed monte carlo tests . assuming a power law with spectral index @xmath1 and with @xmath89 as an input , we calculated the corresponding cmb angular power spectrum and we created random realizations around it . neglecting correlations , we sampled the probability distribution derived from the noise model proposed in knox ( 1995 ) : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the theoretical spectrum , @xmath100 and @xmath101 this distribution has the mean equal to the theoretical spectrum , @xmath102 , and variance @xmath103 in other words we have incorporated in the noise model the fit of the diagonal of the fisher matrix @xmath71 obtained by the wmap team ( verde et al .",
    "2003 ) through monte carlo realizations of the sky that included noise , beam and cut sky effects .    to speed up the computations",
    ", we considered just the diagonal elements of the inverse of the covariance matrix @xmath71 , and consequently of the inverse of the matrix @xmath104 in eq.([qmatr ] ) , and we created samples of the power separately at each multipole .",

    "[ fig.1.0 ] show the outcome of the test and it is relevant to notice that the bias that results from the reconstruction is negligible when compared with type i and even type ii errors .",
    "this conclusion supports our consideration of the reliability of the less conservative type ii errors , when utilised to detect the departure from the flat and concordance power law models .",
    "we also noted that type ii errors are almost identical to the standard deviation uncertainties computed from the monte carlo samples ; this provides a useful check for the method .",

    "we have also checked that when choosing @xmath45 following eq.([eq : snd ] ) for each individual monte carlo sample built from an initial spectrum with features added , the resulting mean reconstruction was a conservative smoothed version of the starting one .",
    "the analysis of the monte carlo realizations validates that the algorithm used here indeed produces an almost unbiased estimator of power spectrum , when very flat spectra are used as input .",
    "if the power spectrum has real features , then some bias will be inevitably present in the estimator , but it will act in order to conservatively underestimate the features .",
    "we verified that the monte carlo reconstructions on all scales are well described by a gaussian distribution that follows type ii errors .    in fig .",

    "the figure can provide intuition of how unlikely in some wave number ranges the reconstruction could resemble a statistical random deviation from the fiducial spectrum , and depicts a graphical version of the null hypothesis test described in the previous section .    assuming the flat spectrum to define the fiducial initial conditions , we find evidence for the three following potential deviations from a power spectrum without features considering type i ( type ii ) errors : a cutoff for the largest scales @xmath105 at 1 ( 2 ) sigma c.l . ; a dip at @xmath4 at 1.5 ( 3 ) sigma c.l . ; a bump a @xmath106 at 1 ( 2 ) sigma c.l .. while with the power law as the fiducial spectrum , we find , considering type i ( type ii ) errors : a cutoff at @xmath107 at 1.5 ( 2.5 ) sigma c.l . ; a dip at @xmath108 at 1.5 ( 3 ) sigma c.l . ; a bump a @xmath109 at 1 ( 2 ) sigma c.l ..    we now provide another way to estimate the deviations , that is practically equivalent to integrating over the distribution defined by the errors of type ii built around the null hypothesis spectra in defined ranges in wavenumber space . following @xcite , we define a measure of the distance between a generic spectrum ( @xmath110 ) and the fiducial one ( @xmath111 ) in the wavenumber range limited by @xmath112 and @xmath113 : @xmath114 we calculated the distance of all the monte carlo samples and the wmap reconstruction with respect to the fiducial spectrum and we counted how many realizations had a distance larger than the one computed for the wmap data deconvolution . in this way we could quantify the probabilities of exceeding the observed deviations in wmap data respect to the fiducial models .",
    "we detected the following potential departures from a scale free ( spectral index @xmath1 ) initial spectrum : a cut - off at @xmath3 at 79.5% ( 92% ) , a dip at @xmath4 at 87.2% ( 98% ) and a bump at @xmath5 at 90.3% ( 55.5% ) .",
    "we add that the prior , similarly to the weiner filter ( see e.g. @xcite ) , helps in retrieving useful information at the crossover between the signal and noise dominated regimes , if combined with monte carlo testing .",
    "furthermore methods such as ours offer the possibility to penetrate the informational barrier built up by cosmic variance .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig.4 ] the wmap data together with the convolved estimated power spectrum in multipole space to illustrate the effect of smoothing .",
    "that interesting features might have been present in the power spectrum could have already been guessed from an inspection of the wmap data confronted with a power law power spectrum @xmath0cdm prediction .",
    "however how the information ( including the experimental uncertainties ) in multipole space was going to be transferred in detail to wave number space could not have been predicted reliably without an analysis that had taken properly into account the complicated transfer functions .",
    "furthermore , the processed information is now in a format that permits a direct comparison with the theoretical predictions from inflation .",
    "even though we compute the full covariance matrices , in the plots we show the errors given by the square root of the inverse diagonal elements of the relative covariance matrix for illustrational purposes .",
    "however it is important to assess if the deviations detected and their magnitude take their origin from error correlation .",
    "we implemented some tests to check this relevant issue . in turn , we replaced the wmap multipoles that correspond to the scales of the three detected features with the concordance model predictions without any noise . from the reconstructions in fig .",
    "[ fig.5 ] , we deduce that the evidence for the features is not the product of correlation , since their significance is only slightly worsened .",
    "it is interesting to note that , as expected , the low values of the dipole and the quadrupole are the principal cause for the observed cutoff . furthermore the wiggles in the wmap data around the multipoles of 20 and 40 show up clearly as the bump and the dip in our reconstruction .",
    "we show fig .",
    "[ fig.6 ] how the reconstruction changes if we adopt the analysis of @xcite , based on an all - sky foreground cleaned map derived from wmap data . for representative purposes ,",

    "it can be seen that , with respect to the concordance power law spectrum with spectral index @xmath1 , a cut - off detection is still present at about @xmath116 in frequentist terms , while the bayesian estimate finds the @xmath29 of the null hypothesis @xmath117 away from the estimate @xmath77 .",

    "for example slosar et al .",
    "( 2004 ) find a broad quadrupole likelihood function with a tail that favours greater values , as a result of having marginalized over the foreground templates .",
    "this differs from the wmap analysis that consisted in fitting and subtracting out the templates from the data",

    "the main effect with respect to the model considered previously is a reduction of the cut - off significance due to a smaller optical depth , as the main effect would be to reduce the power at intermediate and small scales while leaving the power unaltered at large scales .",
    "a conspiracy between a low optical depth and enhanced power in the quadrupole and octopole could in principle considerably decrease the detection of a cut - off ; such measurements should therefore be followed closely in future experiments .",
    "given the temperature data from the wmap experiment we have reconstructed at high resolution the primordial power spectrum at large scales by adopting an iterative smoothing algorithm , built to deal with the non - gaussianity of the data errors caused mainly by cosmic variance .",
    "we have fixed the parameters to the best fit late - time cosmological parameters found by @xcite in order to search for deviations from the concordance featurless power law power spectrum , with spectral index @xmath87 approximately equal to 0.97 .",
    "we also implemented the analysis with a scale free spectrum .",
    "the horizon scale for the model we are considering corresponds to the wavenumber @xmath2 . by creating and reconstructing from monte carlo realizations of cmb data",
    ", we have verified that our proposed estimator is effectively unbiased if a scale free or power law with spectral index @xmath1 power spectra are assumed .",
    "this has led us to the detection of the following three deviations from a scale free ( spectral index @xmath1 ) initial spectrum : a cut - off at @xmath3 at 79.5% ( 92% ) , a dip at @xmath4 at 87.2% ( 98% ) and a bump at @xmath5 at 90.3% ( 55.5% ) .",
    "we have also derived using two alternative ways a measure of the local uncertainties in the estimates of deviations and effective location of the initial power spectrum , labeled by errors of type i and ii .",
    "the frequentist analysis finds the low @xmath6 cutoff of the estimated power spectrum to be at about @xmath123 away from the @xmath8 model , while in the bayesian analysis the model is about @xmath124 away from the estimated spectrum .",
    "the convergence in the observed low power at large scales by the wmap and cobe dmr experiments is certainly interesting and merits attention .",
    "since further high quality large - scale temperature and polarization cmb data are expected in the near future , for example from the next data releases of the wmap team and the future planck mission , any method that could shed light on the nature of the primordial perturbations will prove to be extremely useful for improving our understanding of the mechanism that is responsible for the generation of cosmic structure .",
