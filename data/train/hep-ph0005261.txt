    "the effect of matter is basically to suppress the oscillation amplitude both in the sun and in the earth ( @xmath26 ) , so that ( coherent ) flavor oscillations take place only in vacuum , starting from the sun surface @xcite .",

    "therefore , it is intuitively clear that in the intermediate range between ( [ js ] ) and ( [ msw ] ) , corresponding approximately to @xmath29 ev@xmath2/mev , the simple vacuum oscillation picture of the js regime becomes increasingly decoherent and affected by matter effects for increasing values of @xmath0 , leading to a hybrid regime that might be called of `` quasi - vacuum '' ( qv ) oscillations , characterized by @xmath30    in the past , quasi - vacuum effects on the oscillation amplitude and phase have been explicitly considered only in relatively few papers ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) as compared with the vast literature on solar neutrino oscillations , essentially because typical fits to solar @xmath4 rates allowed only marginal solutions in the range where qv effects are relevant .",

    "we have optionally considered , besides the exact @xmath66 profile , also the exponential profile , which allows a further comparison of the numerical integration of the msw equations with their analytical solutions , as worked out in @xcite in terms of hypergeometric functions ( that we have implemented in an independent code ) . also in this case , no difference is found between the output of the different codes .",
    "concerning the calculation of the quantities @xmath49 and @xmath53 in the earth , we evolve analytically the msw equations at any given nadir angle @xmath89 , using the technique described in @xcite , which is based on a five - step biquadratic approximation of the density profile from the preliminary reference earth model ( prem ) @xcite and on a first - order perturbative expansion of the neutrino evolution operator .",
    "such analytical technique provides results very close to a full numerical evolution of the neutrino amplitudes , the differences being smaller than those induced by uncertainties in @xmath66 @xcite .",

    "[ f3 ] ( exponential density ) shows that , in the latter case , the correction term @xmath92 tends to be somewhat overestimated , in particular when the semianalytical approximation is used .",

    "[ f1 ] ) and , subdominantly , to the details of the density profile shape at the border ( @xmath111 ) . as a consequence , the `` exponential profile '' calculation of @xmath48 ( either semianalytic @xcite or analytic ) tends to shift systematically the onset of solar matter effects to lower values of @xmath0 .",

    "a similar behavior is found by using the true density profile @xmath124 everywhere ) . as for @xmath48",
    ", we find also for @xmath70 no significant dependence on the neutrino production point in the sun core .    in conclusion , we find only modest differences between the analytical calculations of @xmath48 , based on the exponential density profile , and its semianalytical approximation .",
    "the difference with respect to the numerical calculation of @xmath48 , based on the standard solar model profile , is instead more pronounced , and leads to a factor of @xmath109 difference in the value of @xmath0 where qv effects start to be significant .",
    "therefore , we recommend the use of the electron profile from the standard solar model , implying numerical calculations of @xmath48 . , calculated for the standard solar model density , upon request from the authors .",

    "the earth effect shown in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] is operative in the lowermost part of the so - called `` low '' msw solution @xcite to the solar neutrino problem , or , from another point of view , to the uppermost part of the vacuum solutions @xcite .",
    "concerning the phase correction @xmath71 ( not shown ) , it is found to be smaller than @xmath133 in the whole mass - mixing plane considered , and thus can be safely neglected .    in practical applications ,",

    "( [ pmat ] ) , both in the amplitude of the oscillating term ( @xmath134 ) and in the remaining , non - oscillating term .",
    "while the integration over time can be transformed , for the non - oscillating term , into a more manageable integration over @xmath89 @xcite , this can not be done for the oscillating term , which depends on time both through the prefactor @xmath135 and through the phase @xmath75 ( via eccentricity effects ) . however , in region of the mass - mixing plane where the earth effect is non - negligible ( namely , where @xmath136  few  % ) , it turns out that @xmath137 , so that the total amplitude of the oscillating term is small . moreover , as it will be discussed in the next section , energy smearing effects strongly suppress the oscillation factor @xmath138 in the same region .",
    "therefore , for @xmath139 ev@xmath2/mev , the oscillating term in eq .",
    "( [ pmat ] ) is doubly suppressed , and one can safely consider only the non - oscillatory terms .",
    "in the just - so regime , the interference factor @xmath138 in eq .",
    "( [ pmat ] ) can lead to an observable modulation both in the energy and in the time distribution of solar neutrino events .",
    "this modulation gradually disappears as @xmath0 increases , as a consequence of several decoherence effects ( @xmath140 ) @xcite , which are typically dominated by energy smearing @xcite .",
    "the broader the neutrino spectrum , the lower the values of @xmath0 where decoherence becomes important : therefore , it suffices to consider the narrowest spectra ( the so - called be neutrino `` lines '' @xcite ) for illustration purposes .",
    "let us consider a @xmath4 `` line '' energy spectrum @xmath141 , with @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "the energy - averaged oscillating factor , @xmath144 can be written , in the narrow - width approximation @xmath145 , in terms of the fourier transform of the spectrum , @xmath146 more precisely , @xmath147 where @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 .    using the @xmath141 profile for the be lines from @xcite ,",
    "we find that the phase correction @xmath151 is smaller than a few permill in the region where the damping factor @xmath152 is greater than a few percent .",
    "if @xmath151 is neglected , the average oscillation factor can be simply written as the oscillation factor at the average energy , times a damping term @xmath152 : @xmath153 a similar approach to smearing effects for neutrino lines was developed in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ f5 ] shows the damping factor @xmath152 for the two be neutrino lines at @xmath154 and @xmath155 mev .",
    "the factor is negligible for @xmath156 ev@xmath2/mev , implying that the oscillation pattern is completely smeared out in such range . , where @xmath157 is the line width .",
    "] the onset of smearing effects is shifted to even lower values of @xmath0 for continuous energy spectra . in conclusion ,",
    "the integration over neutrino energy makes the average oscillation factor @xmath158 always negligible in the range where earth matter effects are important , even for the narrow be neutrino lines .",
    "such accidental simplification should not make one forget that , in general , the transition from coherent to incoherent oscillations is a complex phenomenon that deserves further studies ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a recent _ ab initio _ approach ) .    finally , we recall that integration over time acts as a further damping factor @xcite . at first order in the eccentricity @xmath159 , one has that @xmath160 $ ] and @xmath161 , where @xmath162 is the orbital phase , and @xmath163 $ ] is the normalized time variable ( @xmath164 at perihelion )",
    ". then the yearly average of @xmath138 [ times the square - law factor @xmath165 can be performed analytically @xcite , giving @xmath166 where @xmath167 is the bessel function , acting as a further damping term for large values of its argument .",
    "notice that the maximum fractional variation of the orbital radius , @xmath168 , is an order of magnitude larger than @xmath169 which , in turn , is larger than the phase corrections @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "therefore , one can safely neglect @xmath72 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 in practical applications involving yearly ( or even seasonal ) averages , as we do in this work . however , for averages over shorter time intervals , such approximation might break down .",
    "in particular , @xmath72 ( @xmath70 ) might be comparable to the monthly ( weekly ) variations of the solar neutrino signal .",
    "the observability of such short - time variations is beyond the present sensitivity of real - time solar @xmath4 experiments and would require , among other things , very high statistics and an extremely stable level of both the signal detection efficiency and of the background .",
    "if such difficult experimental goals will be reached in the future , some of the approximations discussed so far ( and recollected in the next section ) should be revisited and possibly improved .",
    "we have seen in the previous sections that , as @xmath0 increases , the deviations of @xmath48 ( and subsequently of @xmath49 ) from the vacuum value @xmath170 become increasingly important .",
    "we have also seen that the phase corrections @xmath70 and @xmath71 are smaller than @xmath171 , which can in turn be neglected in present applications , so that one can practically take the usual vacuum value for the oscillation phase , @xmath172 .",
    "we think it useful to organize known and less known results through the following approximate expressions for the calculation of @xmath40 , which are accurate to better than 3% with respect to the exact , general formula ( [ pmat ] ) valid at any @xmath0 .    for @xmath173 ev@xmath2/mev ,",
    "one can take @xmath174 , and obtain the just - so oscillation formula @xmath175 with @xmath176 . for @xmath177 ev@xmath2/mev ,",
    "one can still take @xmath178 , but since @xmath179 ( quasi - vacuum regime ) one has that @xmath180 where @xmath176 , and @xmath48 has to be calculated numerically ( see also @xcite for earlier versions of the above equation ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath181 ev@xmath2/mev , also earth matter effects are important @xmath182 ; however , this complication is balanced by the disappearance of the oscillating term ( @xmath183 ) due to unavoidable smearing effects , so that the usual msw regime is recovered : @xmath184    time averages are then relatively simple to implement . in eqs .",
    "( [ p1 ] ) and ( [ p2 ] ) , the yearly averages of @xmath138 can be performed analytically [ eq .  ( [ faid ] ) ] . in eq .",
    "( [ p3 ] ) , the nighttime average of @xmath185 can be transformed into a more manageable integration over the nadir angle , both for yearly @xcite and for seasonal @xcite averages .",
    "to summarize , the above sequence of equations describes the passage from the regime of just - so to that of msw oscillations , via quasi - vacuum oscillations . in the js regime , oscillations are basically coherent and do not depend on the electron density in the earth or in the sun ( @xmath186 ) . in the msw regime , oscillations are basically incoherent ( @xmath187 ) and , in general , depend on the detailed electron density profile of both the sun and the earth .",
    "in particular , in the msw regime one has to take into account the interplay between the density profile and the neutrino source distribution profile .",
    "the intermediate qv regime is instead characterized by partially coherent oscillations ( with increasing decoherence as @xmath0 increases ) , and by a sensitivity to the electron density of the sun ( but not of the earth ) .",
    "such sensitivity is not as strong as in the msw regime and , in particular , qv effects are independent from the specific @xmath4 production point , which can be effectively taken at the sun center .    for the sake of completeness , we mention that , for high values of @xmath3 ( @xmath188 ev@xmath2/mev ) , corresponding to @xmath189 in the sun , the sensitivity to matter effects is eventually lost both in the sun and in the earth ( @xmath174 ) , and one reaches a fourth regime sometimes called of energy - averaged ( ea ) oscillations , which is totally incoherent and @xmath66-independent : @xmath190 such regime , which predicts an energy - independent suppression of the solar neutrino flux , seems to be disfavored ( but perhaps not yet ruled out ) by current experimental data on total neutrino rates . in conclusion , for @xmath3 going from extremely low values to infinity , one can identify four rather different oscillation regimes , @xmath191 each being characterized by specific properties and applicable approximations .",
    "experiments still have to tell us unambiguously which of them truly applies to solar neutrinos .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , in the qv regime the @xmath58 survival probability ( [ p2 ] ) is non - symmetric with respect to the operation @xmath192 , which instead holds for js oscillations [ eq .  ( [ p1 ] ) ] .",
    "here we extend such observation to @xmath59 oscillations , under the hypothesis @xmath193 which leads to eq .",
    "( [ p3nu ] ) .",
    "the @xmath58 case is recovered for @xmath194 .    equation  ( [ p3nu ] ) for @xmath195 preserves the ( a)symmetry properties of @xmath196 under the replacement @xmath192 .",

    ", the symmetry tends to be restored , mainly because the asymmetric term @xmath207 in eq .",

    "iv ) is not strictly valid , and one should in principle consider also the @xmath4 source profile .",
