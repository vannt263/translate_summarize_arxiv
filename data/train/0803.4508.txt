    "we consider an infinite range ising spin system whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the @xmath20component of pauli spin , representing a classical ising spin at site @xmath21 and @xmath22 s are random variables taking up values either @xmath23 or @xmath24 with equal probabilities .",
    "the above hamiltonian describes a cluster of @xmath25 ising spins , each connected to all others through exchange interactions of equal strength ( @xmath26 ) but random signs . to make the energy extensive in system - size",
    ", one has to scales the energy with a factor of @xmath27 , as done in the rest of the article .",
    "the system is heavily frustrated ( i.e. , no spin configuration can satisfy all the bonds ) , due to the presence of both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds in random fashion .",
    "the high degree of connectivity ( i.e. , the infinite range of the interactions ) adds to the complexity of the problem .",
    "for such a system , finding the ground state spin configuration for any arbitrary given realization of interactions ( the set of @xmath22 s ) , is known to be an np - hard problem @xcite . in thermodynamic",
    "limit the system becomes a non - ergodic spin glass below some spin glass temperature @xmath28 . to illustrate the complexity and the difficulty in finding the ground state we consider a typical sample with @xmath29 ( we studied many samples , and the features are qualitatively the same as we for this one ) as shown in fig .",
    "the plot of the number of spin configurations against the energy ( panel a of fig .",
    "[ pel ] ) of the system clearly shows that there is a huge entropy barrier between the ground state and the states which has higher energies .",
    "a levels with energy close to zero has a degeneracy of the order of @xmath30 , while the ground state degeneracy is of the order of unity .",
    "this problem could be easily overcome and ground state could be reached if the potential energy landscape ( pel ) had have a more or less monotonic gradient towards the ground state , as observed in ferromagnetic samples ( or may be one having few local non - monotonicity for samples with a few disorder and short - range interactions ) . but here , as illustrated in panel ( b ) , the pel is quite random . in the fig .",
    "[ pel](b ) , we plot the energy against spin flip , as we start from a completely ordered ( all up ) configuration and flip one - by - one all the @xmath31 spins until the mirror - symmetric state ( all down ) . in a ferromagnet ,",
    "a similar plot would generate a convex curve ( with the peak at the zero energy ) symmetric about the energy axis , reaching the ground state at its both end .",
    "but here we find a completely random profile far above the real ground state energy .",
    "there is no helpful gradient to guide towards the ground state ( if one incorporates moves with more than one spin - flips , then the profile becomes even more rugged ) .",
    "these two features , that is , the extremely low entropy of the ground state and the absence of a consistent gradient towards the ground state in the pel makes it absolutely difficult for a random walker to find a ground state with the help of a naive local minimization algorithm , like the principle of going down hill , as shown in fig .",
    "[ pel ] panel ( c ) .",
    "here we show the energy of the system evolved using the random single spin - flip move , and allowing it to accept the move only if it minimizes the energy .",
    "we find even after @xmath32 moves , it fails to reach the ground state .",
    "one can guess that after getting down in energy in first @xmath33 steps , it gets lost among the huge number of configuration with higher energies ( which it does not accept ) and can not find a way to reach the sparsely occurring lower energy states .",
    "the eigenstates of @xmath34 ( the basis states ) are the direct - products of the eigenstates of @xmath19 s .",
    "each basis state represents a distinct spin configuration of the system . to perform zero - temperature quantum annealing of this @xmath0 ising system , we add a transverse field term @xmath35 where @xmath36 s are @xmath37-components of pauli spins which introduces probability of tunneling between the basis states ( classical configurations ) , and @xmath38 is the strength of the transverse field .",
    "the total hamiltonian is thus given by    @xmath39    we start with a high enough value of @xmath40 initially ( at @xmath11 ) and sample the ground state of @xmath41 using a zero - temperature quantum monte carlo algorithm ( discussed below ) . during sampling , we reduce the strength @xmath38 of the transverse field following a linear annealing schedule    @xmath42    where @xmath43 denotes evolution time . at the end of the simulation @xmath44",
    "we are left with the classical hamiltonian @xmath34 and if @xmath45 is large enough , the simulated system is finally found to be in one of its ground state configurations . for low values of @xmath46 ,",
    "one generally ends up with a higher energy configuration .",
    "to simulate the ground state of @xmath41 , we use a zero - temperature quantum monte carlo technique @xcite .",
    "we describe the method to some details here , since it is not broadly known , and has been implemented so far only to simulate pure systems with short - ranged interactions . here",
    "we generalize the implementation for an infinite - range system with disorders .    in this method one",
    "makes a linear transformation of the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a suitable real constant and @xmath49 is the identity operator , such that the matrix representation of @xmath50 in the eigen - basis of @xmath34 is non - negative and irreducible ( if such a transformation could not be done for an @xmath41 , then this method would not be applicable for it ) .",
    "one can then consider @xmath50 to be the transfer - matrix of a uniform chain ( with periodic boundary condition(pbc ) ) of classical plackets , where each placket is nothing but a classical cluster of @xmath25 mutually interacting ising spins represented by @xmath34 .",
    "now the key point is that one can simulate the chain of classical plackets using the elements of its transfer - matrix @xmath50 and in this simulation the equilibrium average of any observable ( say , energy ) related to a single placket is approximately equal to the expectation value of the observable over the dominant eigenstate of @xmath50 .",
    "the dominant eigenstate of @xmath50 in turn , is the ground state of @xmath41 ( due to the form of the linear transformation between them ) .",
    "thus we actually simulate the ground state properties of @xmath41 by simulating the chain . in the next section",
    "we establish the scheme in details .      in this subsection",
    "we demonstrate that the equilibrium averages for a single member of a uniform classical chain ( with pbc ) is approximately equal to the respective averages ( expectation values ) over the dominant eigenstate of the transfer - matrix of the chain .",
    "let us consider a uniform chain of @xmath51 identical classical spin clusters ( or may be any localized discrete degrees of freedom in general ) @xmath52 s , as shown in fig .",
    "( [ a : plckt - chn ] ) .",
    "each of the @xmath52 s can be in , say , @xmath53 different states .",
    "one may note here , that if each placket @xmath54 is a spin cluster embedded in dimension @xmath55 , then the chain is actually a @xmath56-dimensional object . since the chain is uniform",
    ", its hamiltonian will be of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a @xmath59 matrix whose elements are the possible contributions to the hamiltonian from a pair of neighboring spins , as each of them takes up @xmath53 different values independently .",
    "the partition function of the chain is thus given by @xmath60}\\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\mu_1=1}^{p } ... \\sum_{\\mu_l=1}^{p } e^{-\\beta f(\\mu_{1},\\mu_{2 } ) } \\times e^{-\\beta f(\\mu_{2},\\mu_{3})}\\times ... \\times   e^{-\\beta f(\\mu_{l},\\mu_{1})}\\\\ & = & \\sum_{\\mu_1=1}^{p} ... \\sum_{\\mu_l=1}^{p } { \\mathcal w}_{\\mu_{1}\\mu_{2}}\\times { \\mathcal w}_{\\mu_{2}\\mu_{3}}\\times ... \\times { \\mathcal w}_{\\mu_{l}\\mu_{1 } } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath61 , @xmath62 being the temperature inverse .",
    "again , since each of @xmath63 and @xmath64 can take up @xmath53 independent values ( i.e. , can be in @xmath53 independent states ) , @xmath65 defines a @xmath59 matrix @xmath50 . hence summing over all the indices from @xmath66 to @xmath67 and recalling the rule of matrix multiplication one gets @xmath68 the matrix @xmath50 is a transfer - matrix for the chain . if the matrix @xmath50 is symmetric then ( it is not the necessary but the sufficient condition ) one can write @xmath69 where @xmath70 are the eigenvalues of @xmath50 ordered by the index @xmath71 , so that @xmath72 if @xmath73",
    ". here a few points are to be noted .",
    "since all the elements of @xmath50 are strictly positive at any finite @xmath62 , the matrix @xmath50 is both non - negative and primitive ( i.e. , there exists some finite @xmath74 , such that @xmath75 is strictly positive ) . then according to perron - frobenius theorem ( see @xcite ) the dominant eigenvalue @xmath76 is strictly positive and non - degenerate .",
    "thus @xmath77 here , the leading order error is @xmath78 and since @xmath76 is non - degenerate , @xmath79 for any @xmath80 .",
    "now , to see how one can simulate the chain using @xmath50 , one has to note that the probability that the chain be in a given state @xmath81 , in which @xmath82 etc , is @xmath83}\\times ... \\times e^{-\\beta f[\\mu_{l}(a),\\mu_{1}(a)]}\\right)/z\\ ] ] @xmath84 thus using the conditions of detailed balance , one obtains transition probability from a state @xmath81 to another state @xmath85 given by @xmath86 thus if @xmath50 is given , we can simulate the equilibrium properties ( thermal average ) of any physical quantity related to a placket @xmath54 in the chain . to obtain that , we require to know the probabilities for the placket @xmath54 to be in its different possible states when the chain is in equilibrium .",
    "let @xmath87 denotes the probability that the placket is found in its @xmath88-th state when the chain is at thermal equilibrium ( at a given @xmath62 ) .",
    "if the @xmath88-th state is represented by a column vector @xmath89 , then these column vectors satisfy the matrix relation @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the transpose of @xmath92 and the sequence of matrices implies the proper multiplications between them .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath93 be the dominant ( normalized ) eigenvector of @xmath50 corresponding to the dominant eigenvalue @xmath76 , and if @xmath50 is hermitian then one can expand @xmath93 linearly in terms of the basis vectors as @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the amplitude of the basis state @xmath89 in @xmath93 .",
    "thus in the sampling of @xmath93 using the basis states @xmath89 s , the probability of occurrence of the state @xmath89 will be @xmath96 .",
    "now , one can show that @xmath97 .",
    "\\label{p - mu - k}\\ ] ] the above equation says that one can sample the dominant eigenstate @xmath93 of the matrix @xmath50 just by sampling its basis states ( classical configurations of a placket in the chain ) according to the probability of their occurrence in the simulation of the placket at equilibrium in the chain ( using the elements of @xmath50 itself , as prescribed in ( [ p - ab ] ) ) .    to prove equation ( [ p - mu - k ] ) , we take any placket in the chain and call it @xmath98 . probability that @xmath98 is found in the state @xmath89 is @xmath99_{\\mu_{1 } = k } $ $ $ $ = \\frac{1}{z}\\left({\\mathcal w}\\right)^{l}_{kk } =   \\frac{\\langle k|({\\mathcal w})^l|k\\rangle}{trace \\{({\\mathcal w})^l\\ } } \\label{p - mu - k - z}\\ ] ] above , we have summed up the probabilities of all the configurations of the chain , in which @xmath100 .",
    "now let @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) denote the normalized eigenvector of @xmath50 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath103 .",
    "then one may have a linear transformation between @xmath101 s and @xmath89 of the form @xmath104 and the reverse transformation @xmath105 @xmath106 being an unitary matrix . hence @xmath107 using ortho - normality of @xmath108 s .",
    "thus , from equation ( [ p - mu - k - z ] ) we get @xmath109,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which proves equation ( [ p - mu - k ] )",
    ".    thus one can in fact simulate the dominant eigenstate of any given suitable ( hermitian , non - negative and primitive ) @xmath110 matrix up to a good approximation using the above results .",
    "one has to define a uniform chain ( with pbc ) of classical plackets , each having @xmath25 possible configurations .",
    "the @xmath21-th state of a placket corresponds to the @xmath21-th vector of the basis in which the given matrix is represented .",
    "one then views the given matrix as the transfer - matrix for a placket in the chain , and simulate the chain using its elements ( as prescribed in ( [ p - ab ] ) ) . at equilibrium , the probability of getting a placket in its @xmath21-th state is equal to the modulus square of the weight of the @xmath21-th basis vector in the representation of the dominant eigenstate of the given matrix ( up to an error of the form discussed above ) .",
    "we now illustrate the implementation of the above monte carlo scheme by employing it to simulate the ground state of @xmath41 given in eq .",
    "( [ ham - pmj ] ) . here",
    "basis vectors @xmath89 s are the eigenvectors of @xmath34 , and a classical placket is the cluster of @xmath25 ising spins with exchange interaction described by @xmath34 .",
    "now we make a linear transformation of the form given in eq .",
    "( [ lt ] ) , with @xmath111 .",
    "the resulting @xmath50 matrix is clearly non - negative ( since none of its diagonal element are all smaller than @xmath112 and off - diagonal elements are either @xmath113 or @xmath38 , which we always take to be positive . ) .",
    "since @xmath41 connects a basis state to all other basis states that can be obtained by a single spin flip from it , there is no closed subspace for @xmath41 . thus @xmath50 is also irreducible .",
    "it can be shown that for a non - negative irreducible matrix , all the results of perron - frobenius theorem we have used here , holds good @xcite .",
    "besides , @xmath50 is of course hermitian . hence we can take @xmath50 as a transfer - matrix for the chain .",
    "it corresponds to some interaction @xmath114 between two neighboring ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 ) and some inverse temperature @xmath62 ( not explicitly important here ) , given by @xmath115 to simulate the ground state of @xmath41 at a given @xmath40 for a particular realization of @xmath22 s , we construct a uniform chain of @xmath51 plackets with pbc . each placket is a cluster of @xmath25 classical ising spins ( described by cooperative term of @xmath41 ) connected through the given particular realization of @xmath22 s ( see ( [ a : plckt - chn ] ) ) .",
    "we start with an arbitrary spin configuration ( same for all plackets ) and a given value of @xmath40 . in one monte carlo",
    "step we randomly visit @xmath51 plackets . at each such visit",
    "we make an allowed move ( a move whose probability is not trivially zero ) , such that the chain goes from a state @xmath81 , say , to a new state , say @xmath85 .",
    "the probability of acceptance of the move is nothing but the transition probability @xmath116 calculated following ( [ p - ab ] ) ( using the elements of @xmath50 ) .",
    "while sampling , one can easily avoid moves whose probabilities are trivially zero ( due to the sparsity of the matrix @xmath50 ) by constructing a more restricted markov process to do the sampling @xcite .    for doing quantum annealing of the same system , we start with a high enough value of @xmath40 and reduce it very slowly with time @xmath43 ( monte carlo step ) following a linear schedule . during visiting different plackets in a given monte carlo step ,",
    "@xmath40 is however held fixed .",
    "the linear schedule is specified by @xmath117 and the total number of monte carlo steps executed ; @xmath118 is linearly reduced to zero with @xmath43 within @xmath119 of the total monte carlo steps , we thus have @xmath120 , where @xmath46 is the annealing time .",
    "we have studied the relaxation behavior of several random @xmath22 samples with @xmath29 for linear annealing schedule ( we start with an initial transverse field @xmath118 and reduce it linearly with monte carlo step , so that it becomes zero before last few , @xmath121 , steps .",
    "we observe that for an annealing of @xmath122 monte carlo steps , the system reaches the true ground state ( determined by an extensive search method ) in almost every case , for a suitably large initial transverse field @xmath118 .",
    "we calculate the average exchange energy of the chain ( over @xmath51 plackets ) in each monte carlo step , and average that over a few @xmath123 monte carlo steps . the exchange energy ( as given by @xmath34 of eq .",
    "( [ ham - pmj ] ) is not linear in @xmath25 and we have to scale it by a factor @xmath27 to obtain the intensive energy density . in thermodynamic limit , this intensive energy density approaches the value @xmath124@xcite ( our finite size results shows some fluctuations about that ) . in fig .",
    "( [ a : threer ] ) the relaxation behavior of three typical random realizations ( r1 , r2 and r3 ) during their annealing are shown .",
    "we found that for doing annealing of a given sample within a given number of steps , there is a suitable range of @xmath118 .",
    "if @xmath118 falls below the range , then the transition probabilities are too low to be able to anneal the system within the given time . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath118 is above the range , then the rate of change of @xmath38 is not slow enough to ensure the convergence to the ground state finally ( i.e. , the evolution in no more adiabatic ) . in fig .",
    "( [ a : threer ] ) , the values of respective @xmath118 s belong to the lower end of the respective ranges .",
    "the ranges are generally wide enough , and one can find a @xmath118 within the range , just by a few trials .    the relaxation behavior is found to be typically  linear \" in the sense that the long - time averages decrease linearly with time ( see lower part of fig .",
    "( [ a : kifit ] ) ) .",
    "the relaxation observed in shorter time scale of course shows fluctuations around that linear behavior ( shown in the upper part of fig .",
    "( [ a : kifit ] ) ) . this linear nature of relaxation is typically seen independent of the details of the particular realizations .",
    "[ qmc - qsg ]    in a glassy system , where the potential energy landscape has valleys separated by huge energy barriers , simulating the ground states ( and possibly other low - lying states ) for low kinetic energy ( like the ground state for a low value of the transverse of a transverse ising spin glass ) using a zero - temperature quantum monte carlo may be very difficult and time consuming . this is because , for small kinetic term , the acceptance probability may become very small for higher potential energy states energy states , and the system may take a very long time to get out of a local potential energy minimum in order to visit other equally relevant lower - potential - energy valleys . thus if one gets stuck is a local minimum far above the ground state , at an early , stage of the simulation , then it would not be able to reach the low lying valleys , whose contributions to the ground state are much more significant .",
    "this can be remedied to some extent by annealing the sample quantum mechanically starting with a high value of the kinetic energy , and then reducing it slowly up to the low value at which the simulation is desired .    for the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( [ ham - pmj ] ) , simulation of the ground state for a small fixed value of the transverse field @xmath40 ( using the zero - temperature transfer - matrix monte carlo algorithm described here ) is found to be much closer to the exact result ( obtained using exact diagonalization @xcite ) when the simulation is done following an annealing ( reducing @xmath40 from a high value to the low value at which the simulation is desired ) than that done directly keeping the value of @xmath40 fixed to the low value from the onset .",
    "we compare the results of both kinds of simulations ( with and without annealing ) , for several random samples of the spin glass for @xmath125 with the respective exact diagonalization results for them ( see fig .",
    "[ simu ] ) .",
    "we conclude summarizing few points regarding the performance of the algorithm described here .",
    "the algorithm discussed here is quite general ( applicable to any disordered spin system in any dimension ) and may be used for simulating small system - sizes quite satisfactorily .",
    "however , the moves are very restricted , since each spin flip in a placket requires the two nearest - neighboring plackets to be in the same configuration with it . for large system sizes",
    ", this is too restrictive a condition to move freely enough through the configuration space to procure a satisfactory sampling rate .",
    "in addition , since the acceptance probability for higher potential energy configurations ( like most other zero - temperature quantum monte carlo algorithms ) depends on the magnitude of the kinetic term , it is hard to simulate the ground state for low values of the kinetic term .",
    "we have shown how quantum annealing can be utilized in overcoming this difficulty ( at least partially ) .",
    "this remedy is is expected to work also for other zero - temperature quantum monte carlo methods in principle ."
