    "cataclysmic variable ( cv ) binary systems contain a white dwarf primary star that accretes mass from a roche lobe - filling late - type main sequence secondary star .",
    "mass loss from the secondary through the inner lagrange point ( l1 ) forms an accretion disk about the primary , and viscosity within the accretion disk acts to transfer angular momentum outward in radius allowing mass to migrate inward to the surface of the white dwarf .",
    "the disk and bright spot associated with the accretion stream impact point are typically the brightest components in a cv system ( warner 1995 , hellier 2001 , frank , king & raine 2002 ) .",
    "the mean disk luminosity is ultimately provided by the release of gravitational potential energy as the material migrates inward through the disk given by @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the mass transfer rate onto the primary of mass @xmath2 and radius @xmath3 .",
    "the mass flow rate through l1 is governed by the long - term evolution of the binary separation and the secondary star itself , but the mass flow rate through the disk and onto the primary is a function of the viscosity of the disk  the higher the viscosity , the higher the inward mass flow rate .",
    "v447 lyrae ( kic 8415928 , @xmath4=18.4 , brown et al . 2011 ) is a little - studied cv in the nasa _ kepler _ field of view .",
    "its sky co - ordinates are @xmath5 @xmath6 ( 2000.0 ) .",
    "it was discovered and announced as gr 247 by romano ( 1972 ) who noted a maximum photographic magnitude of 17.2 and a minimum fainter than 18.5 .",
    "these observations were included in downes , webbink & shara ( 1997 ) but the system was noted as undetected in the 2mass survey ( hoard et al .",
    "2002 ) nor is it a known x - ray source .",

    "< , < , < \" , ]     we show the long cadence light curve for v447 lyr obtained over quarters q611 in figure [ long - cadence - light ] .",
    "the light curve shows 11 outbursts : 6 of these have a ` short ' duration clustered around a mean of 6.6 days and 5 have a ` long ' duration clustered around a mean of 12.3 days ( table [ out - log ] ) .",
    "the ratio of the duration of the long outbursts to short outbursts is 1.9 and is consistent with that seen in systems with long orbital periods ( and hence high mass transfer rates , e.g. warner 1995 ) .",
    "indeed , it is very similar to that seen in u gem ( @xmath7=4.25 hrs ) whose short and long outbursts have a typical duration of 5 and 12 days respectively ( cannizzo , gehrels & mattei 2002 ) .",
    "the mean recurrence time between successive long outbursts is 118 days ( the mean recurrence time in u gem is @xmath8120 days , szkody & mattei 1984 ) .",
    "there are only two successive short outbursts and they were separated by 30 days .",
    "however , perhaps the most notable aspect of the light curve is that an eclipse is observed every 3.74 hrs ( figure [ lo5-curve ] ) .",
    "this feature is seen because the binary inclination angle is high enough to cause the physically larger mass - donating secondary star to eclipse the white dwarf ( if the inclination is close to 90@xmath9 ) , or the accretion disc and bright spot ( if the inclination is slightly less than 90@xmath9 ) , once every orbital period leading to an apparent dimming in the light from the system .",
    "we show below that the likely inclination of this system is such that the white dwarf itself is not eclipsed .",
    "we therefore identify v447 lyr as the first eclipsing dwarf nova in the _ kepler _ field .",
    "the short duration outbursts show a sharp rise followed by an exponential type decay . in contrast",
    ", the long outbursts all show an initial sharp rise ( as in the short outbursts ) followed by a plateau lasting less than a day , and then an increase in flux ( see figure [ lo5-curve ] ) , followed by a gradual decline in flux .",

    "a normal ( or short ) outburst is thought to trigger a super ( or long ) outburst when the material in the outer radii of the accretion disk becomes ionised .",
    "this precursor has not been seen in long outbursts of u gem type cvs until very recently ( cannizzo 2012 ) .",
    "we attribute this to the fact that the cadence of observations has not been high enough to resolve this precursor . however , given",
    "a precursor has been seen in super outbursts and now in long outbursts , we suggest this precursor is common to long outbursts from accreting cvs in general .",
    "any model aiming to reproduce long / super outbursts will have to account for this feature .",

    "we initally estimated the time of the mid - eclipse in individual eclipses during each of the outbursts which were observed in sc mode . given that the exposure time of each sc data point was nearly one minute and the eclipse profile was rather noisy , the uncertainty on the eclipse times were relatively large .",
    "however , it allowed us to obtain a working eclipse ephemeris which we used to phase the sc light curve . to improve the signal - to - noise of the eclipse profile we split up the light curve into sections consisting of 3 orbital cycles",
    "when the system was in outburst and up to 30 cycles during quiescence and phase folded and binned the data .",
    "this allowed us to refine the linear eclipse ephemeris so that during an outburst the eclipse mid - point was defined as @xmath10=0.0 .",
    "this gave the eclipse ephemeris :    @xmath11    where the numbers in parentheses give the standard error on the last digits .",

    "the full width at half maximum of the eclipse profile is @xmath130.08 .",
    "assuming we can derive the mass of the secondary star ( @xmath14 ) from the mass - period relationship ( patterson et al . 2005 ) and a mass of @xmath15 for the white dwarf ( @xmath160.45 ) we predict an inclination angle @xmath17 ( or @xmath18 for @xmath19 ) , using the figure 2 of horne ( 1985 )",
    ".    in the left hand panel of figure [ folded ] we show a set of folded light curves taken from a short outburst ( so4 ) , where we have detrended the light curve to remove the effect of the decline from outburst , and have split the light curve into sections 0.7 days in length and then folded the light curve according to the ephemeris derived in the previous section . at outburst maximum",
    "the brightness out of eclipse is more uniform , and as the system approaches quiescence , a peak appears in the folded light curve at @xmath10=0.8 due to the bright spot becoming progressively more prominent as the system approaches quiescence . during outburst the bright spot makes a relatively significantly smaller contribution to the optical light from the system compared to quiescence .    in the middle panel of figure",
    "[ folded ] we show the results from a similar analysis of a long outburst ( lo4 ) .",
    "we find that at outburst maximum ( the lowermost curve in figure [ folded ] ) , there is a peak in the folded light curve at @xmath120.55 .",
    "in contrast , in the right hand panel of figure [ folded ] we show the results of the same analysis for the next long outburst ( lo5 ) . at maximum brightness",
    "there is a prominent peak in the folded light curve shortly after the eclipse , while there is a minumum in the light curve at @xmath120.6 .",
    "over the course of the outburst the brightness out of eclipse becomes more uniform ( the analysis for l03 is very similar to lo5 ) .",
    "we speculate that this evolution of the accretion disc ( and the differences between the lo4 and that of lo3 and lo5 ) is due to the evolution of sprial shocks in the accretion disc as observed in u gem ( groot 2001 ) .",
    "we now turn our attention to the characteristics of the eclipse profile . as indicated in  5 , we extracted three successive cycles of data during outbursts and phase folded and binned these data using the eclipse ephemeris . for intervals of quiescence we did this for up to 30 orbital cycles of data .",
    "we fitted the eclipse profiles using a model consisting of a linear trend plus a gaussian profile and determined the mid - point and width of the eclipse .",
    "we show the results of this in figure [ phase - width ] .",
    "the most obvious result is that during an outburst the phase of the mid - eclipse is centered near @xmath10=0.0 ( since that defined our ephemeris ) , whereas the phase of the mid - eclipse during quiescence occurs at later phases ( @xmath10=1.021.03 ) .",
    "there is some suggestion that after a long outburst the phase of eclipse during short outbursts gets progressively later . during long outbursts",
    "the full width half maximum of the eclipse is greater compared to quiescence and also compared to short outbursts .",
    "the difference between the results from quiescence and outbursts is largely due to the relative contribution of the bright spot which is seen strongly in the folded light curve from quiescence ( figure [ low - fold ] ) but not during outburst ( figure [ folded ] ) .",
    "if it was only the accretion disk which was being eclipsed then it would only be the eclipsed width which would change and not the eclipse phase .",
    "( 12,11 ) ( -3,-0.4 )    to obtain a better overview of the differences between the short and long outbursts , we took each outburst and phased it such that @xmath10=0.0 defined the start of the outburst , with the end phase being the start of the next burst .",
    "we then folded the points of mid - eclipse and the eclipse width for short and long bursts - we show the results of this in figure [ no - so ] .",
    "this shows that there is a tendancy for the orbital phase of mid - eclipse to be earlier ( and with a larger eclipse width ) in long outbursts compared to short outbursts , which we interpret as the accretion disk has a tendancy to be larger during a long outburst compared to a short outburst . in short outbursts",
    "there is some evidence that the point of mid - eclipse increases after the outburst followed by a decrease , which may suggest a decrease in the size of the disk followed by an increase leading up to the next outburst . during a long outburst the width of",
    "the eclipse tends to decrease after outburst .",
    "we explore the physical causes for these variations in ",
    "[ discuss ] .",
    "we searched for periodic signals ( other than the orbital period ) in the short cadence data .",
    "we did this by splitting up the data into sections which were taken from quiescent intervals and also individual outbursts , where we detrended the data to remove the effect of the general decline from outburst .",
    "the lomb scargle periodogram was used to obtain power spectra for each data section .",
    "power spectra taken from the quiescent data showed a strong signal at a period very close ( within the error ) to the orbital period .",
    "similarly , power spectra of detrended light curves during outbursts also showed maximum power at a period consistent with the orbital period .",
    "we therefore found no significant evidence for super - humps in these data .",
    "the detection of super - humps in u gem ( smak & waagen 2004 ) is rather controversial ( schreiber 2007 ) .",
    "however , we note that the novalike variable bb dor has an orbital period only slightly shorter than v447 lyr at 3.70 hr ( rodrguez - gil et al .",
    "2012 ) , and is reported to display superhumps with a period of 3.93 hr .",
    "continued monitoring of v447 lyr to search for evidence of super - hump behaviour is therefore recommended since systems with an orbital period just shorter than 4 hrs may define the edge of the superhump instability strip in period space .",
    "( 6,9 ) ( -3.5,0.5 )",
    "the cadence of our sc observations preclude us from resolving distinct binary components ( e.g. white dwarf and accretion disc ) in the eclipse profile .",
    "however , we have found a systematic difference in the orbital phase of the mid - eclipse as seen in quiescence and in outburst . we therefore caution that unless you can detect the eclipse of the white dwarf , mid - eclipse times determined from quiescence should not be mixed with times determined from outburst .",
    "detailed observations from eclipsing dwarf novae place strong constraints on the accretion disk radius as a function of time .",
    "two well - studied systems are u gem ( smak 1984 ) and z cha ( odonoghue 1986 ) .",
    "the disk expands dramatically during outburst , and then contracts exponentially .",
    "anderson ( 1988 ) presents a simple disk model in which the sudden appearance of high viscosity material in outburst causes the rapid expansion , and the accretion of low angular momentum material from the secondary causes the slower contraction .",
    "figure 1 of anderson shows a collection of all the u gem data , which shows a variation of @xmath20 between about 0.29 and 0.37 .",
    "thus the outburst radius expands by @xmath830% during outburst .",
    "anderson infers a minimum mass in the outer accretion disk of @xmath21@xmath22 .",
    "ichikawa & osaki ( 1992 ) examined the radius expansion question using a detailed numerical model for the accretion disk thermal limit cycle mechanism and confirmed anderson s overall results .",
    "although the variation in the eclipse width shown in the bottom panel of figure [ phase - width ] shows more variability than the results of smak ( 1984 ) , it is similar quantitatively to u gem - which is apparently a near twin of v447 lyr in many ways .",
    "it is more difficult with our data to state clearly what the form of the decay is , due to the scatter in the quiescent data , but in going from quiescence to outburst the disk expands from @xmath80.08 to @xmath80.12 in phase units , an increase of @xmath850% . given the similar orbital periods of v447 lyr and u gem , a fit using a simple model like anderson s should also produce a lower limit disk mass @xmath21@xmath22 .",
    "we report observations of v447 lyr which show that it is the first dwarf nova in the _ kepler _ field to show eclipses .",
    "it has an orbital period of 3.74 hrs and shows almost equal numbers of long and short outbursts , which makes it a near twin of the well studied dwarf nova u gem . by fitting the mean eclipse profile of three",
    "successive eclipses we find that the phase of the mid - eclipse occurs earlier during outbursts compared to quiescence and that the width of the eclipse is greater during an outburst .",
    "this suggests that the accretion disk has a larger radius during outburst compared to during quiescence and is consistent with an expansion of the outer disk radius due to the presence of high viscosity material associated with the outburst , followed by a contraction in quiescence due to the accretion of low angular momentum material .",
    "_ kepler _ observations of dwarf novae outbursts have found that super - outbursts in the shorter orbital period dwarf novae appear to be triggered by a normal outburst .",
    "we find that long outbursts also appear to be triggered by short outbursts in v447 lyr .",
