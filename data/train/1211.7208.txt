    "in constructing dense matter equations of state ( eoss ) , it is strongly desired to respect hypernuclear data ; hyperons are expected to emerge in the neutron star core , and they drastically soften the dense matter eos . while nucleonic eoss without hyperons predict the maximum mass of neutron stars as @xmath0 , hyperons are expected to appear and reduce the maximum mass to @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "contrary to these understandings , a two - solar - mass neutron star ( @xmath2 ) is discovered recently by using the shapiro delay , and it is claimed that most of the eoss with the appearance of strange hadrons are ruled out  @xcite .",
    "it is also questionable even for surviving nucleonic eoss to support the massive neutron star , when hyperons are introduced .",
    "thus we need to find either the reason why hyperons do not appear in dense neutron star matter or the mechanism how eoss can be stiff enough even with hyperons .",
    "one of the possible mechanisms to make the eos stiffer is the three - baryon repulsion . in microscopic g - matrix calculations ,",
    "the three - baryon repulsion is found to be necessary to support the 1.44  @xmath3 neutron star when hyperons are included  @xcite . in relativistic mean field ( rmf )",
    "models , attractive contribution from the scalar potential grows more slowly than the baryon density . in terms of non - relativistic languages , this behavior can be interpreted as the _ implicit _ three - body repulsion caused by relativistic effects .",
    "this three - body repulsion had been considered to be enough to support neutron stars even if hyperons are taken into account , until the two - solar - mass neutron star was discovered . when hyperon - meson couplings are chosen away from the su(6 ) values and the @xmath4 meson self - energy is ignored , the calculated neutron star maximum mass",
    "can be compatible with the observed massive neutron star  @xcite .",
    "however , these hyperon - meson couplings have not been seriously verified in finite hypernuclear systems , and the density dependence of the vector potential in these treatments would not be compatible with the relativistic brckner - hartree - fock ( rbhf ) calculation  @xcite , whose results ensure that rmf models are reasonable . thus the most natural way to make the eos with hyperons stiff enough would be to introduce _ explicit _ three - body repulsion .    in this work ,",
    "we examine how three - body couplings affect the neutron star matter eos in the framework of rmf .",
    "we include the interaction terms of baryon - meson - meson ( @xmath5 ) and three - meson ( @xmath6 ) couplings .",
    "two mesons in the @xmath5 term couple with two other baryons , and three mesons in the @xmath6 term couple with three baryons .",
    "thus @xmath5 and @xmath6 couplings correspond to the explicit three - body forces .",
    "each term in the rmf lagrangian can be characterized by the number @xmath7 in the furnstahl - serot - tang ( fst ) expansion  @xcite , where @xmath8 is the number of baryon fields , @xmath9 is the number of non - nambu - goldstone boson fields , and @xmath10 is the number of derivatives .",
    "the baryon - meson coupling terms @xmath11 belong to @xmath12 , and the present three - body coupling terms correspond to @xmath13  the next - to - leading order interactions in the fst expansion .",
    "while some of the @xmath13 terms are considered to be absorbed by field redefinitions  @xcite , we need to modify higher order ( @xmath14 ) terms to compensate the redefinitions .",
    "we demonstrate the importance of @xmath13 terms , especially the @xmath5 terms , on the dense matter eos .",
    "we adopt here an rmf lagrangian , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 corresponds to the ordinary rmf lagrangian including @xmath12 two - body couplings , and @xmath17 represents the meson self - energies , which include an @xmath18 potential and a logarithmic potential of scalar - isoscalar mesons  @xcite . here",
    "we ignore the nucleon coupling with scalar and vector @xmath19 mesons ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , as usually assumed .",
    "for the three - body coupling terms , @xmath22 , we first consider symmetric nuclear matter case , where @xmath22 is taken to be @xmath23 \\psi_b -c_{\\sigma\\omega\\omega } f_\\pi\\sigma\\omega_\\mu\\omega^\\mu \\ .\\label{eq : n=3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first and second terms modify the effective mass of nucleons , @xmath24 , where @xmath4 represents the temporal component .",
    "these @xmath13 terms modify the effective mass from the @xmath12 coupling with @xmath25 .",
    "the third term modifies the vector potential of nucleons at high density , @xmath26 , and the fourth term represents the @xmath4 meson mass shift at finite density . in rbhf calculations ,",
    "the vector potential at low densities is almost proportional to the baryon density , but the vector potential to baryon density ratio @xmath27 is suppressed around @xmath28 or at higher densities .",
    "this suppression in rbhf is sometimes simulated by the @xmath18 term  @xcite or by the density dependent coupling  @xcite . when we simulate the suppression only with the @xmath18 term , the ratio @xmath27 is monotonically decreasing with increasing @xmath29 . with a large coefficient of @xmath18 , eos at high density",
    "is thus too softened to support the massive neutron star  @xcite .",
    "the density dependent vector coupling is usually chosen to decrease and be saturated with increasing @xmath29 . with the present @xmath13 coupling terms in eq .",
    "in addition to the @xmath18 term , we try to simulate the decreasing and saturating behavior of the @xmath27 ratio found in the rbhf results .    for the massive neutron star puzzle ,",
    "hyperon - meson coupling is another key . in many of the rmf parameter sets",
    ", the hyperon- and nucleon - vector meson coupling ratio is chosen to be @xmath30 based on the spin - flavor su(6 ) symmetry or the quark counting arguments .",
    "this choice is the main reason why we can not support the massive neutron star with hyperons .",
    "mesons in rmf models describe scalar and vector potentials from various origins ; two pion exchange , correlation from two - baryon short range repulsion , meson pair exchanges , and so on , in addition to the meson fields consisting of @xmath31 .",
    "thus it is not mandatory to impose the spin - flavor su(6 ) or flavor su(3 ) relations among the coupling constants . in our previous work",
    "@xcite , we have adopted a more phenomenological prescription ; while the hyperon - isoscalar vector meson couplings ( @xmath32 ) have been chosen to be the flavor su(3 ) values , other couplings in the @xmath33 hyperon sector ( @xmath34 ) have been fitted to the hypernuclear data , including @xmath35 separation energies ( @xmath36 ) , the bond energy of the double @xmath35 hypernucleus ( @xmath37 ) , and the @xmath38 atomic shift data . it should be noted that we need to adopt the @xmath39-@xmath40 coupling much smaller than the flavor su(3 ) value in order to fit the @xmath38 atomic shift data  @xcite .",
    "we here explore the results using the hyperon-@xmath4 coupling value other than the su(3 ) value .",
    "specifically , we examine the results with @xmath41 in the later discussion .",
    "we prepare two three - body coupling parameter sets , tb - a and tb - b .",
    "the scalar meson part of @xmath17 is taken from our previous work ( scl3 rmf model )  @xcite , which describes known properties of finite and infinite nuclear systems such as binding energies per nucleon ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "three - body couplings in tb - a are determined so as to reproduce the density dependence of the vector potential in rbhf at high densities . in tb - b ,",

    "we may introduce the tensor coupling of vector mesons to obtain a larger @xmath64 potential , but the tensor coupling does not modify the uniform matter eos in the mean field treatment . in the @xmath41 case , both scalar and vector potentials become stronger , and we find slightly different trends in @xmath36 as shown in fig .  [",

    "@xmath35 single particle excitation energies are calculated to be smaller than those without three - body couplings , since the three - body couplings suppress the scalar potential and @xmath35 effective mass is larger in the present parametrization .",

    "the @xmath70 coupling term @xmath71 is related to the symmetry energy at high densities .",

    "we have examined three - body couplings ( @xmath13 ) in the framework of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) model .",
    "we can obtain stiffer eoss at high densities while keeping the nuclear matter properties around @xmath28 and finite nuclei .",
    "we have also demonstrated that finite hypernuclear properties are reasonably well described with a modified @xmath73 from the flavor su(3 ) value . by these two modifications in the rmf lagrangian ,",
    "we can obtain the neutron star matter eoss , which support the recently observed two - solar - mass neutron star .",
    "these findings indicate that it would be possible to answer the massive neutron star puzzle ; we can explain recently observed massive neutron star even if we respect hypernuclear data .",
