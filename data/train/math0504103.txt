    "one of the most important properties of  @xmath9 is `` functoriality , '' i.e. , for all continuous maps  @xmath17 the induced homomorphism  @xmath18 does not increase the seminorm .",

    "measure homology is a curious generalisation of singular homology : let @xmath1 be a topological space , let @xmath8 and let @xmath19{\\ssim k}{x}$ ] be some set of singular simplices .",
    "the idea of measure homology is to think of a singular chain @xmath20 with real coefficients as a signed measure on  @xmath21 having the mass  @xmath22 on the set  @xmath23 the measure chain complex consists of all signed measures on  @xmath21 satisfying some finiteness condition .    thus the measure chain complex is larger than the singular chain complex and hence provides more room for constructions such as `` smearing '' ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* , page  547ff ) .",
    "the other side of the coin is that it is quite hard to gain a geometric intuition of more complicated measure chains .",
    "depending on the choice of the mapping spaces  @xmath21 and their topology , there are two main flavours of measure homology :    * one for general topological spaces using the compact - open topology on the set of all singular simplices  the corresponding chain complexes and homology groups are denoted by  @xmath24 and  @xmath25 .",
    "* one for smooth manifolds using the -topology on the set of smooth singular simplices  the corresponding chain complexes and homology groups are denoted by  @xmath26 and  @xmath27 .    in both cases , measure homology",

    "measure homology of the second kind ( so - called smooth measure homology ) was introduced by thurston  @xcite .",
    "some basic properties of smooth measure homology are also listed in ratcliffe s book  @xcite .",
    "a thorough treatment of measure homology for general spaces is given in the papers of zastrow and hansen @xcite .",
    "in both papers it is shown that measure homology for -complexes coincides _ algebraically _ with singular homology with real coefficients .",
    "the general idea of the proof of theorem  [ isomisomthm ] and  [ smisomisomthm ] is to take a dual point of view : singular homology and the @xmath0-seminorm admit a dual concept , called bounded cohomology .",
    "the key property is that the canonical seminorm on bounded cohomology and the @xmath0-seminorm are intertwined by a duality principle ( theorem  [ duality ] ) .    unlike the @xmath0-seminorm , bounded cohomology and its seminorm",
    "are rather well understood by ivanov s homological algebraic approach @xcite . in our proof of theorem  [ isomisomthm ] and  [ smisomisomthm ] , we take advantage of a special cochain complex  @xmath28 computing bounded cohomology .",

    "then the duality principles allow us to deduce that the algebraic isomorphism  @xmath32 must be isometric .    for simplicity , we only prove theorem  [ isomisomthm ] in detail . the smooth case , requiring a small detour to smooth singular homology , is considered briefly in section  [ smoothsec ] ( and is also explained in the author s diploma thesis @xcite )",
