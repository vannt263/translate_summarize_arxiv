    "the millisecond pulsar j1740@xmath05340 in the globular cluster ngc  6397 ( @xcite ) is a member of a binary system with a relatively wide orbit of period 1.35 days , a companion with mass @xmath1m@xmath2 , and is eclipsed for about 40% of its orbit at a frequency of @xmath3ghz . in much tighter eclipsing binaries , like those containing psrs  b1957 + 20 ( @xcite ) , b1744@xmath024a ( @xcite ) and j2051@xmath00827 ( @xcite ) , all having companions of mass @xmath4m@xmath2 , the eclipses are believed to be caused by a wind resulting from ablation of the companion by a relativistic pulsar wind .",
    "psr  j1740@xmath05340 is in a wide orbit and the wind energy density impinging on the companion is significantly less than that estimated for the close eclipsing systems , and is unlikely to drive a wind of sufficient density off a degenerate companion . in the discovery paper , damico et al .",
    "( 2001 ) argued that the companion could be an unevolved star of mass comparable to the turnoff mass of the cluster , @xmath5 m@xmath6 , releasing a wind sufficiently dense to produce the observed eclipses .",
    "such a hypothesis , which would make psr  j1740@xmath05340 an unusual system , can be ultimately tested with the optical identification of the pulsar companion .    in this letter",
    "we report on the first year of pulse timing observations of this pulsar .",
    "we provide timing parameters , including the position , and we report on further observational evidence of the interaction of the pulsar signal with the companion atmosphere .",
    "regular timing observations have been made since 2000 july with the parkes radio telescope , using the center beam of the multibeam receiver at 1.4 ghz .",
    "the observing system is the one used in the discovery observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of interstellar dispersion are minimized with a filter bank having 512 @xmath7 0.5 mhz frequency channels for each of two linear polarizations .",
    "after detection , the signals from individual channels are added in polarization pairs , integrated , 1 bit - digitized every 125 @xmath8s , and then recorded on magnetic tape .",
    "pulse times of arrival ( toas ) are determined offline by fitting a standard pulse profile having a high signal - to - noise ratio to the observed profiles and analyzed using the program tempo and the de200 solar system ephemeris ( @xcite ) .",
    "a simple keplerian model of a binary system was used in the analysis .",
    "for about six months we routinely collected data on this pulsar several times a week using an integration time of 30 min for each observation . from the orbital parameters obtained during the confirming observations in 2000 july , we knew that the pulsar was eclipsed in the orbital phase interval 0.050.45 , so we have generally made observations at epochs when the predicted orbital phase was outside this interval . in this way we have obtained a reasonable number of good quality integrated pulse profiles ( with signal - to - noise ratios in the range 1025 and typical timing errors in the range 1040 @xmath8s ) , while some low quality profiles were rejected .",
    "most of the latter were obtained at epochs relatively close to the predicted eclipse edge , but some were taken far from the nominal eclipse region , at orbital phases where the pulsar was expected to be detected clearly .",
    "we also noted that , while we could obtain a coherent timing solution over several months , the resulting post - fit rms scatter of the residuals was large compared to the typical nominal timing uncertainties of individual toas , suggesting the presence of systematic effects .    in order to probe the hypothesis that this behavior could be due to the interaction of the pulsar radiation with the companion atmosphere ,",
    "we have recently initiated a series of long observations starting close to the eclipse edge near the descending node , and lasting for a substantial fraction of the orbit in the non - eclipsing region .",
    "the orbital period is @xmath9 32 hr and the pulsar is visible at parkes for @xmath9 11 hr on a given day .",
    "thus far we have obtained four relatively long observations .",
    "the results are shown in figure  1 . in one case ( fig .",
    "1a ) the pulsar signal was relatively stable in intensity and pulse phase , while in the other three cases ( figs .",
    "1b , c and d ) significant excess propagation delays of up to @xmath9 3 ms and strong intensity variations are observed . in particular",
    ", in the case of figure  1c , the pulsar signal was always rather weak and the pulse was about two times wider than usual , covering about 30@xmath050% of the rotational phase .",
    "the correlation between delay peaks and flux reduction suggests that interstellar scintillation is not responsible for this behavior .",
    "these fluctuations are comparable to those observed at a lower frequency ( @xmath9 400 mhz ) in psr  b1957 + 20 near the eclipse edges around orbital phases 0.2 and 0.3 ( @xcite ) . in psr  j2051@xmath00827 ( @xcite )",
    "flux density variations and variable propagation delays are seen at 1.4 ghz when the pulsar signal is detectable through the eclipse region .",
    "psr  b1744@xmath024a displays similar irregularities also far from the usual eclipse region , with typical delays of @xmath10s ( @xcite ) . instead",
    ", much larger excess delays , @xmath11 1 ms , are observed at nearly all orbital phases in the case of psr  j1740@xmath05340 .",
    "these observations suggest that the pulsar is in fact orbiting within an extended envelope of matter released from the companion .",
    "we investigated the frequency - dependent behavior of the observed delay events by splitting the 256-mhz bandwidth available at 1.4 ghz into two adjacent subbands .",
    "as can be seen from figure  1 , significant pulse broadening and signal - to - noise reduction is usually associated with large delays . we have therefore limited our analysis to small delays only .",
    "figure  2 shows an example of the measured excess delays in the two subbands .",
    "the small panel also shows these measurements plotted against each other .",
    "the best - fitting straight line corresponds to @xmath12 for the excess delays , consistent with the @xmath13 dependency expected if the delays are due to dispersion in an ionized medium .",
    "if entirely due to dispersion , the excess propagation delays of up to @xmath14 visible in figure  1 would correspond to electron column density variations of @xmath15 @xmath16 , or @xmath17 @xmath18pc ( @xmath19 being the delay at 1.4 ghz in ms ) .",
    "this corresponds to a pulse broadening of @xmath20 ms over the receiver bandwidth ( to be compared with an intrinsic pulse fwhm of @xmath21 ) and may be responsible for most of the signal attenuation and pulse broadening observed near the delay peaks .    from figure",
    "1 we can also see that far from the eclipse region the typical time scale of the rise to maximum delay is of order 1@xmath02 hr .",
    "this indicates that observations of @xmath11 3 hr are required in order to identify reliably a non - delayed portion of an observation and to obtain a bona fide toa .",
    "this explains why a timing solution mainly based on relatively short integrations may be affected by systematic effects .    in order to obtain a reliable phase - connected timing solution for this pulsar we have selected by visual inspection among all the data collected at 1.4 ghz in the last 12 months only those toas with no indication of delay and those corresponding to profiles not affected by pulse broadening . in this way we have obtained a solution with a post - fit rms residual of @xmath9 120 @xmath8s .",
    "the corresponding model parameters are reported in table  1 .",
    "figure  3a shows the residuals for all toas collected whereas figure  3b shows those for the selected toas only , all relative to the model in table  1 .",
    "the dispersion measure ( dm ) was fitted using toas from two adjacent subbands from the stable long integration shown in figure  1a .",
    "a fit for orbital eccentricity may be biased because only @xmath22 of the orbit is sampled .",
    "nevertheless a formal fit results in an upper limit of @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , and in deriving the parameters listed in table  1 we have fixed @xmath25 . further observations may better constrain this limit . similarly , a longer data span will be needed for investigating possible changes in the orbital parameters , as seen e.g. in psr  b1957 + 20 ( nice , arzoumanian & thorsett 2000 ) .",
    "psr  j1740@xmath05340 has the longest orbital period ( @xmath26 hr ) and the most massive minimum companion mass ( @xmath27 m@xmath2 , assuming a neutron star mass of 1.40 m@xmath2 ) among the 10 known eclipsing pulsars ( nice , arzoumanian & thorsett 2000 ; camilo et al .",
    "when combined with the typical duration of the eclipse at 1.4 ghz ( @xmath28 hr ) , these parameters imply an eclipse radius @xmath29 larger than the orbital separation @xmath30 for any value of the orbital inclination @xmath31 .",
    "@xmath29 is defined as the chord subtended on the orbital circumference of radius @xmath30 by the angle between the orbital phase of eclipse ingress ( or egress ) and the orbital phase 0.25 .",
    "table  2 shows the relevant parameters associated with different companion types : a 0.19 m@xmath6 he - white dwarf ( wd ) ( corresponding to @xmath32 ) and a range of main sequence ( ms ) stars spanning the mass interval @xmath33 m@xmath6 ( the latter value being the maximum compatible with the age of ngc  6397 ) . as can be seen , @xmath34 r@xmath2",
    "@xmath35 @xmath36 r@xmath2 .    from the observation in figure  1a",
    ", we infer that there are no systematic electron column density variations over a wide orbital phase interval .",
    "hence the neutron star is not orbiting inside a steady corona of ionized matter surrounding the companion star .",
    "more likely , the pulsar is just skimming a large envelope of matter , whose clumpness and varying shape at distances from the companion comparable with @xmath29 could be triggered by the movement and the energy flux of the pulsar itself .",
    "the irregular features appearing in the three observations of 2001 march ( figs .",
    "1b1d ) could for example represent this kind of interaction .",
    "the values of the roche lobe radius @xmath37 span the interval 1.32.2r@xmath2 ( @xcite ) . because @xmath38 , the matter causing the eclipses escapes the gravitational influence of the companion star and therefore must be continuously replenished .",
    "the large position offset of psr  j1740@xmath05340 with respect to the center of ngc  6397 ( @xmath39 ) limits the unknown contribution to the observed period derivative @xmath40 due to acceleration in the globular cluster potential .",
    "assuming a king model ( 1962 ) for the central mass density , core radius @xmath41 and central luminosity density ( in units of @xmath42/pc@xmath43 ) @xmath44)=5.6 $ ] ( @xcite ) , distance @xmath45 ( reid & gizis 1998 ) , and a mass - to - luminosity ratio @xmath46 ( @xcite ) , we derive ( see e.g. camilo et al .",
    "2000 ) @xmath47 . even accounting for the uncertainties in some of the above parameters ( e.g. , @xmath48 ) , the observed @xmath40 ( table  1 ) should be only slightly affected by @xmath49 .",
    "thus we can use @xmath40 to infer the rotational energy loss of the pulsar , @xmath50 ergs s@xmath51 . a he - white dwarf of minimum mass @xmath52 with an effective temperature @xmath53k",
    "has radius @xmath54 ( @xcite ) . because the radius decreases with increasing temperature",
    ", we use @xmath55 as an upper limit . at the distance of @xmath56 , the power impinging on the degenerate companion",
    "would be @xmath57 ergs s@xmath51 .",
    "this would allow release of an ionized wind from the degenerate companion at a maximum rate @xmath58    assuming isotropic emission , mass continuity implies that the companion star releases mass at a rate @xmath59 using the values in table  2 and the density at the eclipse radius inferred from the observation of the excess delays assuming completely ionized matter ( @xmath60\\sim 3\\times 10^{-18 } \\delta t_{-3}$ ] g @xmath18 ) , we obtain @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the wind velocity at @xmath29 in units of 10@xmath63 cm s@xmath51 ( typical order of magnitude of the escape velocity from the surface of the companion ) .",
    "thus , only in the case of low terminal velocity of the wind ( @xmath64 km s@xmath51 , corresponding to improbable electron temperatures of @xmath65 k at @xmath29 ) could the pulsar flux sustain the ablation .",
    "more massive wds would further exacerbate these difficulties .",
    "the hypothesis of a ms companion appears more viable : such a companion could have been acquired as a result of an exchange interaction in the cluster core ( sigurdsson & phinney 1993 ; heggie , hut & mcmillian 1996 ) , a scenario possibly supported also by the position of psr  j1740@xmath05340 @xmath66 core radii from the center of ngc  6397 .",
    "this object is the second farthest pulsar from a cluster core ( in units of core radii ) among the 36 pulsars in globular clusters with precisely determined positions ( after psr  b2127 + 11c in m15 , located at @xmath28 core radii ) .",
    "the unperturbed radius @xmath67 of a ms star of mass @xmath68@xmath69 is @xmath7030 times greater than the maximum possible radius for a wd ( table  2 ) .",
    "the energy required for transporting a unit mass from the surface of the companion to its roche lobe radius @xmath71 is @xmath72 .",
    "given this , the corresponding maximum ablation rate for a ms companion is @xmath73@xmath74@xmath75 .",
    "therefore , only 0.25% of the impinging power would be needed to sustain the inferred mass loss rate @xmath76 .",
    "the bulk of the pulsar energy would thus be available for heating the companion photosphere and perhaps inflating its radius up to roche lobe , in turn making the release of the wind even easier .",
    "this model should be more easily applicable to a light ms star , as large convective envelopes favor bloating of the star ( @xcite ) .",
    "another hypothesis for explaining the large mass loss rate @xmath76 is that the companion is an evolved star that spun up the millisecond pulsar and that is presently undergoing the presumed final stages of mass loss . in this case ,",
    "mass accretion and spinning up of the pulsar would now be inhibited by the pulsar wind flux which could expel the matter overflowing from the roche lobe of the companion ( see for instance burderi et al .",
    "2001 and references therein ) .",
    "if substantiated , this would be the first confirmed example of a recently born millisecond pulsar .",
    "the apparent rather young spin - down age of psr  j1740@xmath05340 ( @xmath77 myr , assuming as mentioned earlier that @xmath49 is negligible ) , and its surface magnetic field ( @xmath78^{1/2 } \\sim 8\\times 10 ^ 8 $ ] g ) would support this model .",
    "however , the future evolution of the binary ( companion evolving into a wd ? ) remains unclear .",
    "detailed simulations of the system are required for comparing this or other more exotic scenarios ( burderi , dantona & burgay 2001 , in preparation ) with the parameters derived from radio and optical observations .",
    "ferraro et al . ( 2001 ) report the possible identification of the optical companion to psr  j1740@xmath05340 with a bright variable star and grindlay et al .",
    "( 2001 ) have detected with _",
    "chandra _ the x - ray counterpart of the millisecond pulsar .",
    "the availability of data in a large spectral band , from radio to optical and x - rays , should help understanding this exotic system and the mechanism(s ) responsible for the radio eclipses .",
