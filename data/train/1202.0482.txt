    "in recent years deep wide field spectroscopic and photometric surveys of galaxies ( e.g. gama , ( * ? ? ? * driver et al . 2011 ) ) are providing us with large statistical samples of galaxies with good quality imaging up to z=0.1 . in parallel ,",
    "automatic routines like galfit ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* peng et al . 2002 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* peng et al . 2010 ) ) or gim2d ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* simard et al . 2002 ) ) have been developed to address the need of fitting large number of images of galaxies with 2d analytic functions to characterise the surface brightness distribution of their stellar components .",
    "in particular srsic functions are the most common distributions that are used to describe the profiles of galaxies and their constituent morphological components .",
    "the derived srsic indexes are then used to classify galaxies as disk or bulge dominated ones ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lee et al . 2012 ) ) or in terms of a bulge - to - disk ratio when bulge / disk decomposition is performed ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* simard et al . 2011 ) ) .",
    "one potential problem with the interpretation of the results of srsic fits is that the measured srsic parameters differ from the intrinsic ones ( as would be derived in the absence of dust ) .",
    "this is because real galaxies , in particular spiral galaxies contain large amount of dust , and this dust changes their appearance from what would be predicted to be seen in projection based on only their intrinsic stellar distributions .",
    "determining the changes due to dust is thus essential when characterising and classifying galaxies based on their fitted srsic indexes .    here",
    "we present results of a theoretical study to quantify the effects of dust on the measured fitted srsic indexes , as a function of the relevant parameters : dust opacity , disk inclination and wavelength .",
    "the results are presented for pure disks and bulges , as seen through a common distribution of dust ( in the disk of the parent galaxy ) .",
    "these results are part of a larger study that aims to quantify the effects of dust on all photometric parameters of young stellar disks , old stellar disks and bulges ( pastrav et al . , in prep ) and builds on our previous work of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mllenhoff et al . 2006 ) .",
    "we based our study on simulated images of dust - attenuated disks and bulges for which their intrinsic parameters are known , being input for the simulations .",
    "we then measured the perceived ( apparent ) photometric parameters using widely used 2d fitting routines , in an attempt to exactly mimic what an observer would measure for a real galaxy .",
    "the difference between the measured parameters ( affected by a combination of projection and dust effects ) and the intrinsic ones ( as used to construct the 3d distributions of stellar emissivity ) provides knowledge on the effects of dust ( and also on projection effects ) .",
    "the aim of the study is thus to provide observers with corrections for the `` simplicity '' of the templates commonly used to analyse images of galaxies , `` simplicity '' which is nevertheless necessary for practical purposes when dealing with large numbers of objects .",
    "the simulated images were produced using radiative transfer calculations and the model of ( * ? ? ? * popescu et al .",

    "* popescu et al . 2000 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* tuffs et al . 2004 ) ) . in brief the disks",
    "were built using a distribution of stellar emissivity described by a double exponential ( in radial and vertical direction ) while bulges were built using the deprojection of general srsic distributions , in particular of a distribution with a srsic index @xmath0 ( de vaucouleurs ) and a srsic index @xmath1 ( exponential ) .",
    "both disks and bulges were attenuated by a common distribution of dust ( present only in the disk ) .",

    "one can see that at longer wavelengths , in the k band , the effects of dust are negligible",
    ". essentially one can measure the intrinsic srsic indexes for both disks and bulges , once corrected for projection effects .",

    "the effect of dust is _ to lower the srsic index _ from its intrinsic value .",
