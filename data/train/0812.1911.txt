    "the metal - insulator transitions of the early transition - metal oxides have been attracting a lot of attention for decades . in particular , since the first report by morin , @xcite much interest has centered about the cornerstone materials @xmath3 and @xmath1 .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact , that these compounds display first order phase transitions with very narrow hystereses of only few kelvin and strong changes of the conductivity of several orders of magnitude , making them promising candidates for applications .",
    "interestingly , the transitions of both compounds are accompanied by characteristic structural changes , which initiated a discussion about the driving forces . dispute centered about the question whether the transitions are driven predominantly by structural instabilities of the parent corundum and rutile structure , respectively , or else by strong electronic correlations . nowadays , the importance of the latter is widely accepted .",
    "however , despite intense work , the questions concerning the origins of the respective transitions have not yet been satisfactorily answered .    in @xmath1 ,",
    "the metal - insulator transition occurs at 340k and is connected with a structural change from the rutile structure to a distorted monoclinic structure .",
    "the latter is characterized by ( i ) pairing of the metal atoms within chains parallel to the rutile @xmath4-axis and ( ii ) their lateral antiferroelectric zigzag - like displacement .",
    "@xcite electronic states near the fermi energy are mainly of v @xmath5 @xmath6 character .",
    "they fall into the @xmath7 band , which mediates v - v overlap along the metal chains , and the remaining , @xmath8 bands .",
    "@xcite at the transition , splitting of the @xmath7 band and upshift of the @xmath8 bands due to increased metal - oxygen overlap produce a finite band gap .",
    "controversial discussions addressed the origin of the @xmath7 splitting , which was assigned either to the metal - metal dimerization or to increased electronic correlations resulting from the reduced screening by the @xmath8 electrons .",
    "@xcite state of the art electronic structure calculations gave strong hints at a structural instability but were not able to reproduce the insulating gap due to the shortcomings of the local density approximation ( lda ) .",
    "@xcite only recently , lda+dmft calculations have demonstrated that the metal - insulator transition may be regarded as a correlation - assisted peierls - like transition .",
    "@xcite    remarkably , the structural distortions occurring at the transition of @xmath1 are characteristic of most of the neighbouring @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 transition - metal dioxides .",
    "in particular , the metallic oxides @xmath0 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14-@xmath15 all display the above - mentioned metal - metal pairing as well as the lateral displacement and crystallize in the same monoclinic structure as low - temperature @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite this crystal structure is displayed in fig .",
    "[ introfig1 ] ,    .",
    "the dimerized metal pairs are highlighted by thick bonds . ]    which allows to identify both the pairing and the lateral displacement of the metal atoms .",
    "in contrast to the above - mentioned metallic @xmath10 and @xmath11 members , the @xmath9 compound @xmath2 , like @xmath1 , undergoes a metal - insulator transition ( at 1081 k ) and a simultaneous structural transition from rutile to a distorted variant having a body - centered tetragonal ( bct ) lattice .",
    "@xcite however , despite the differences in long - range order , the local deviations from the rutile structure are the same as in @xmath1 , i.e.  the niobium atoms dimerize and experience lateral displacements at the transition",
    ". @xcite    despite of the strong interest in the metal - insulator transition of @xmath1 , attempts at understanding the origin of the common structural characteristics are very rare .",
    "indeed , any theory aiming at the metal - insulator transition of @xmath1 would be incomplete without proper account of the local structural distortions of all the rutile - related transition - metal dioxides . in order to close the apparent gap ,",
    "we have started a systematic investigation especially on @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath0 already a decade ago , which by now provides a unified picture .",
    "@xcite    interest in @xmath0 was especially motivated by the metallic nature of this material , the reduced localization of the @xmath16 electrons as compared to the @xmath5 electrons of @xmath1 , and the rather small effective mass , which is similar to the free electron mass .",
    "@xcite these facts point at a rather weak influence of electronic correlations . indeed ,",
    "electronic structure calculations for @xmath0 show a large bonding - antibonding splitting of the @xmath17 bands .",
    "@xcite since the occupied @xmath17 bands lie far below the fermi level , a possible influence of electronic correlations in these bands would not lead to an enhanced effective mass or susceptibility . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath0 can be regarded as a `` model system '' for studying the origin of the structural characteristics of the early transition - metal dioxides .",
    "in addition , an extensive examination of the electronic structure of @xmath0 could help clarifying open questions of the above - mentioned structurally related systems , in particular of the @xmath9 members @xmath2 and @xmath1 .    in a previous work ,",
    "we have presented a comprehensive theoretical study of the electronic properties of @xmath0 .",
    "@xcite electronic structure calculations using the asw method , which is based on density functional theory and the local density approximation ( lda ) , were used to analyze the electronic states involved in low - energy excitations .",
    "in addition , emphasis was put on investigating the origin of the small but distinct deviations of the monoclinic crystal structure from the parent rutile structure , which for this material mainly consist of a metal - metal dimerization parallel to the rutile @xmath18-axis . in short , we were able to show that the monoclinic structure results from what we called an embedded peierls - like instability .",
    "this instability affects the quasi one - dimensional mo @xmath19 bands , which mediate the metal - metal overlap along chains parallel to the rutile @xmath20-axis and which are embedded in a background of the remaining three - dimensionally dispersing mo @xmath16 @xmath8 , electrons , which are also designated as the @xmath21 electrons .",
    "the validity of this scenario had been demonstrated by comparing the electronic properties calculated for the monoclinic structure with those of a properly symmetrized artificial rutile structure .",
    "in addition , we found nearly perfect agreement of our calculated results with the outcome of ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy and x - ray absorption spectroscopy apart from an underestimation of the @xmath7 band splitting by about 1ev due to the well known shortcomings of the lda .",
    "@xcite    this scenario has also been shown to explain the metal - insulator transitions of the @xmath9 members @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which likewise are subject to peierls - like instabilities of the quasi one - dimensional v @xmath22 bands in the embedding backgrounds of the @xmath21 electrons .",
    "@xcite as in @xmath0 , these instabilities cause distortions of the rutile structure by the characteristic metal - metal dimerization",
    ". due to the particular position of the fermi energy in the @xmath9 compounds , the peierls - like instabilities are then accompanied by the observed metal - insulator transitions . at the same time , the opening of the optical band gaps is supported by the lateral antiferroelectric displacements of the metal atoms , which cause an upshift of the @xmath21 states .    continuing our study of @xmath0 ,",
    "we concentrate in the present work especially on the fermi surface and the band dispersions . for the first time , a comprehensive investigation of the full fermi body of @xmath0 , as determined both experimentally and theoretically , will be presented .",
    "in particular , we turn to a comparison of the theoretical results with angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) and de haas - van alphen data ( dhva ) . in doing so , we apply a new implementation of the augmented spherical wave method , which goes beyond the version used in our previous work by taking into account the full potential rather than the approximate muffin - tin potential .",
    "the resulting changes of the electronic states are small but important and lead to a much improved agreement of the theoretical and experimental data .    while published photoemission studies on @xmath0 focused on the angle - integrated analysis of the occupied bands , @xcite a systematic investigation of the band dispersions and the fermi body by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy seems to be still missing .",
    "in addition , existing magneto - transport measurements addressed only fractions of the fermi surface .",
    "@xcite it is the purpose of the present work to make up for the apparent lack in experimental data and to present a comprehensive study of the electronic structure of @xmath0 .",
    "an important difference between dhva and arpes is that the former requires very low temperatures whereas the latter does not .",
    "this is crucial for the early transition - metal dioxides , some of which have a metal - insulator transition and thus do not show a fermi surface at low temperatures . in the present case",
    "we have the opportunity to compare arpes and dhva because @xmath0 is metallic at low @xmath23 .",
    "it turns out that the arpes and dhva results agree well , implying that arpes will be useful to study the fermi surfaces of the @xmath9 members @xmath1 and @xmath2 as well .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : while sec .",
    "[ theory ] gives an overview on the computational method and the theoretical results , sec .",
    "[ experiment ] turns to a description of the arpes and dhva measurements and their results .",
    "the theoretical and experimental findings are subject of a comparative discussion given in sec .  [ discussion ] and sec .",
    "[ summary ] summarizes our results .",
    "the calculations are based on density - functional theory and the local density approximation .",
    "@xcite they were performed using the scalar - relativistic implementation of the augmented spherical wave method ( see refs .   and references therein ) . in the asw method ,",
    "the wave function is expanded in atom - centered augmented spherical waves , which are hankel functions and numerical solutions of schrdinger s equation , respectively , outside and inside the so - called augmentation spheres . in order to optimize the basis set ,",
    "additional augmented spherical waves were placed at carefully selected interstitial sites . the choice of these sites as well as the augmentation radii were automatically determined using the sphere - geometry optimization algorithm .",
    "@xcite self consistency was achieved by a highly efficient algorithm for convergence acceleration .",
    "@xcite the brillouin zone integrations were performed using the linear tetrahedron method with up to 518 * k*-points within the irreducible wedge .",
    "@xcite    in the present work , we used a new full - potential version of the asw method , which was implemented only very recently .",
    "@xcite in this version , the electron density and related quantities are given by a spherical harmonics expansion inside non - overlapping muffin - tin spheres .",
    "in the remaining interstitial region , a representation in terms of atom - centered hankel functions is used .",
    "@xcite however , in contrast to previous related implementations , it is sufficient to work without having to employ a so - called multiple-@xmath24 basis set , permitting a very high computational speed of the resulting scheme .",
    "the electronic properties of @xmath0 in the monoclinic as well as in the above - mentioned artificial rutile structure have already been discussed in much detail in our previous work .",
    "@xcite for this reason , we will in the following concentrate on the changes coming with the consideration of the full potential rather than its muffin - tin approximation .",
    "in particular , we will investigate the changes of the electronic states near the fermi energy .",
    "furthermore , since a very detailed description of the monoclinic crystal structure and its relation to the rutile structure has been given in our previous work , we will not enter a renewed discussion here .",
    "however , we refer the reader to our previous publication especially concerning the definition of the local coordinate systems to be used for the analysis of the electronic states .",
    "@xcite    while a first account of the monoclinic crystal structure was given by magnli and andersson , @xcite , our calculations are based on the refined data by brandt and skapski .",
    "@xcite hence , in contrast to our previous work , @xcite we will exclusively deal with the measured monoclinic structure and not discuss our calculations for the related but artificial rutile structure .",
    "in addition , since there are no indications for the formation of magnetic moments in @xmath0 , spin degeneracy was enforced in all calculations .",
    "the resulting partial densities of states ( dos ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ theofig1 ] .",
    "they look very similar to those presented previously .",
    "@xcite in particular , we recognize the 6.5ev wide o @xmath25 bands well below the fermi energy @xmath26 .",
    "in contrast , the mo @xmath16 @xmath6 and @xmath27 manifolds are found around and well above @xmath26 .",
    "worth mentioning is the pronounced dip of the @xmath6 partial dos at @xmath26 .",
    "it results from the peierls - like instability of the @xmath28 states , which usually are designated as the @xmath7 states and which mediate the metal - metal overlap along the mo atom chains parallel to the rutile @xmath29-axis .",
    "the splitting of these bands into bonding and antibonding branches as resulting from this peierls - like instability is clearly visible in fig .",

    "selection of orbitals is relative to the local rotated reference frame , see ref .  .",

    "[ theofig2 ] , we observe the strong splitting of the @xmath28 states , which do no longer contribute to the metallic conductivity . furthermore , due to the splitting , the low lying , bonding branch is found at the lower edge of the @xmath6 group of bands and nearly separated from the higher lying @xmath34 and @xmath35 bands . the latter",
    "are commonly designated as the @xmath21 bands .",
    "the electronic bands along selected lines within the first brillouin zone , fig .",

    "the split - off doublet is just the bonding @xmath7 band .",
    "the one - dimensional behaviour of the @xmath7 bands is contrasted by the rather isotropic dispersion of the @xmath21 bands . as already pointed out in our previous work , hybridization between both types of bands",
    "is rather small .",
    "in contrast coupling of these states is only via charge conservation .",
    "for this reason , we proposed to interpret the splitting of the former in the course of the structural distortions as an embedded peierls - like instability .",

    "the fermi body is defined by the fermi level crossings of the @xmath34 and @xmath35 bands . in figs .",
    "[ theofig5 ] and [ theofig6 ] , we identify three different fermi surface sheets : two hole - like surfaces near the y - point ( sheet 1 and 2 ) , which occupy 9 and 2% , respectively , of the volume of the 1st brillouin zone , as well as a peanut - shaped electron - like surface centered around the @xmath46-point and occupying 11% of the brillouin zone volume ( sheet 3 ) .",
    "the latter sheet has two loopholes near the b - points , whereas it is closed along the direction @xmath46-a .    as already mentioned in the introduction , use of the exact single - particle potential , i.e.  of the so - called full potential , instead of its muffin - tin or atomic sphere approximation leads to important improvements .",
    "these become obvious from comparing fig.[theofig5 ] of the present work to fig .",
    "6 of ref .. apart from a broadening of the o @xmath25 bands we find distinct differences especially at the z- and the b - point . to be specific ,",
    "those bands , which form the highest occupied states at these points in the present calculation , were found just above @xmath26 in the old calculation .",
    "they generated small hole - like pockets of the fermi surface centered around these points , which were at variance with the experimental findings ( see below ) .",
    "in contrast , in the new calculation these bands are found below @xmath26 and the hole - like pockets disappear .",

    "in general , we found excellent agreement between the experimental and theoretical fermi surface contours .",
    "both the arpes and the de haas - van alphen results confirm the lda calculations . in particular , all three fermi surfaces sheets predicted by theory have been verified experimentally , with respect to both the shape and the dimensions .    of course , while from the theoretical side all fermi surface sheets can be calculated in one go , the measurements are restricted by the respective experimental setups and limitations .",
    "for instance , only certain cuts through the fermi body are usually accessible .",
    "in addition , in the arpes measurements matrix element effects may also play a role , which might undermine the experimental detection of portions of the fermi surface .",
    "this may explain the fact that the calculated fermi surface contours of all three sheets can only be partially observed by arpes .    while the overall agreement of the results of all three methods is very good , there still remain small differences on a quantitative level .",
    "these deviations have been included in tabs .",
    "[ exptab1 ] and [ exptab2 ] . to be specific , the deviations of the arpes fermi vectors from the calculated ones amount to several percent but may go up even to @xmath79% for some experimental points .",
    "yet , both negative and positive deviations occur for both the electron- and hole - like surfaces , precluding systematic errors .",
    "this is different for the de haas - van alphen measurements .",
    "all fermi surface contours resulting from these experiments , including those given in the literature , are systematically smaller than the calculated ones .",
    "@xcite to be specific , the electron - like fermi surface sheet 3 is shifted up to @xmath136% in direction of the occupied states , whereas the hole - like fermi surface sheets 1 and 2 experience a shift of up to @xmath149% in the direction of the unoccupied states . however , we point out that in general the differences between the experimental and theoretical data are of a similar size as the differences between the different experimental techniques .",
    "nevertheless , all these differences between the experimental and theoretical results , namely , both the unsystematic deviations of the arpes data and the systematically smaller dhva fermi surface contours , still conserve , within the above - mentioned limitations of the experimental setups , the volume of the fermi body , which , by construction , is correctly accounted for by the calculations .",
    "@xcite    for the same reason , non - stoichiometry of the samples can most likely be ruled out as a source of the observed quantitative differences . while the phase diagram for mo - o compounds excludes",
    "a hole - doping of more than @xmath150%,@xcite a small defect concentration of @xmath151% has been detected by hall effect measurements.@xcite in general , hole - doping causes a lowering of the fermi level . according to the band structure shown in fig .",
    "[ theofig5 ] , this is equivalent to a shift of the fermi surface contours towards the occupied states .",
    "however , a shift of up to @xmath152% would necessitate a hole - doping of up to @xmath153% .",
    "hence , non - stoichiometry will play only a minor role .    of course , one might argue , that electronic correlations may affect the quality of the calculated results . indeed",
    ", our previous calculations infer the existence of weak electron correlations in @xmath0.@xcite according to the present measurements , effective masses are only slightly enhanced . yet",
    ", an enhancement may explain the reduction of the band width as it has been observed in the @xmath64 measurements on the @xmath154 surface .",
    "however , magneto - transport measurements performed in this direction do not indicate an enhanced effective mass.@xcite furthermore , as has been demonstrated above part of the experimentally observed band width reduction could be accounted for by the inclusion of the full single - particle potential in the present calculations .    going into more detail ,",
    "the deviations between the experimental and theoretical data suggest that , as compared to the experiments , the calculated fermi body is slightly shortened parallel to the @xmath155-axis and dilated perpendicular to this axis . in the directions perpendicular to @xmath155 this presumption",
    "is confirmed by the experimental data . in particular , the cuts through the electron - like arpes and dhva fermi body are smaller than the calculated results .",
    "the assumed shortening parallel to @xmath155 is on somewhat weaker grounds .",
    "only the waist of the `` peanut '' could be measured by arpes , but no experimental points exist at the top and bottom of the `` peanut '' .",
    "in contrast , the dhva measurements in the direction parallel to @xmath155 might be affected by the underlying ellipsoidal approximation . yet , our assumption is well supported by the overall conservation of the volume of the enclosed fermi surface as discussed above .",
    "nevertheless , in passing we mention that these deviation are of the order of a few percent only .",
    "a detailed and comprehensive study of the electronic properties of @xmath0 has been presented .",
    "this material has been analyzed using angle - resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) , de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) measurements , and electronic structure calculations based on a new full - potential implementation of the augmented spherical wave ( asw ) method .",
    "the fermi surfaces determined by both kinds of experiments are in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions .",
    "in particular , three different fermi surface sheets are correctly identified by all three approaches .",
    "these sheets include an electron - like peanut - shaped fermi surface centered around the @xmath46-point , which has a volume of 11% of the brillouin zone , and two smaller hole - like fermi surfaces both centered around the y - point .    as far as they can be detected within the limitations of the experimental geometries , slight differences between the epxerimental and theoretical results concern mainly the shape of the three fermi bodies .",
    "to be specific , from the calculations , the peanut - shaped fermi body appears to be slightly shortened and elongated parallel and perpendicular to the @xmath141-axis .    with the help of the new calculations , controversies concerning two additional fermi surface sheets centered around the z- and b - point",
    "could eventually be resolved . in particular",
    ", the occurence of these sheets could be attributed to the atomic - sphere approximation , which was used in our previous work .",
    "in contrast , in the new full - potential asw calculations , these additional sheets do no longer appear .",
    "furthermore , the full - potential treatment led to a much improved agreement between the arpes results and the calculations as concerns the occupied band width at the @xmath46-point .",
    "in general , the very good agreement between the results obtained by the arpes and dhva measurements for metallic @xmath0 has important consequences for the investigation of those neighbouring transition - metal dioxides , which display a metal - insulator transition .",
    "while the fermi surfaces of the metallic phases of these materials are not accessible to a low - temperature technique as dhva experiments , the good agreement found in the present study implies that arpes measurements will be useful to study the fermi surfaces of the high - temperature metallic phases .",
    "furthermore , the good agreement between the different experimental techniques and the electronic structure calculations , with the deviations between measured and calculated data being of the same order as those between the different experimental techniques , support our original proposal that these calculations are well suited to study the electronic properties of the early transition - metal dioxides . in particular ,",
    "our results are very encouraging concerning the validity of our calculations for the @xmath9 members @xmath1 and @xmath2 and support the interpretation of the metal - insulator transitions of the latter two compounds as embedded peierls - like instabilities .",
