    "recall that a _ partition _ is a non - increasing sequence of positive integers @xmath9 with @xmath10 , called its _ number of parts _ ; @xmath11 is called its _ size _ , and we say that @xmath12 is a _ partition of @xmath3_. also recall that the _ ferrers diagram _ ( or equivalently , using empty squares rather than dots , _ young diagram _ ) of a partition @xmath12 is obtained by placing , in a _ left - justified _ way , @xmath13 dots at the @xmath14-th row .",

    "a partition is called an @xmath25-core if none of its hook - lengths is @xmath25 .",
    "for example , the above partition , @xmath15 , is a @xmath26-core , and an @xmath14-core for all @xmath27 .",

    "this correspondence is used in the maple package core.txt , and was used in [ za ] , but for our present purposes it is more efficient to use order ideals .",
    "recall that an order ideal @xmath107 , in a poset @xmath108 , is a set of vertices of @xmath108 such that if @xmath109 then all elements , @xmath110 , such that @xmath111 also belong to i. equivalently , if @xmath110 does * not * belong to @xmath107 , then all vertices @xmath112 ` above ' it ( i.e. such that @xmath113 ) , also do * not * belong to @xmath107 .",
    "let @xmath114 be the number of order ideals of the lattice @xmath115 with no consecutive labels .",

    "the ` initial conditions ' are @xmath124 , @xmath125 , and for @xmath126 , we have @xmath127    now let s move - on to finding @xmath114 , i.e. the number of order ideals of @xmath115 without consecutive labels .    a diagram of the lattice @xmath115 ( for @xmath128 ) can be found in figure 1(a ) ( see also figure 3 ( page 5 ) of [ yqjz ] , where the lattice is drawn such that the rank - zero vertices are at the bottom rather than on the diagonal ) .",

    "in addition we have the definitely occupied vertices @xmath138 , but since they are definitely occupied , they do nt contribute anything to the count of order ideals .",
    "figure 1(b ) depicts the case when labels @xmath139 and @xmath140 of @xmath141 are occupied and @xmath26 is empty .",
    "all vertices @xmath134 @xmath142 can not be part of the order ideal .",
    "let @xmath143 be a two - triangle lattice , consisting of a triangle with @xmath144 rank - zero vertices whose labels are @xmath145 , and a triangle of length - side @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) whose labels are @xmath148 .",
    "( see figure 2(a ) for a picture of @xmath149 . )",
    "going back to the paragraph above , subtracting @xmath129 from all labels , gives us a lattice isomorphic to @xmath150 .",
    "let @xmath151 be the number of order ideals of the lattice @xmath143 without consecutive labels .",
    "then we have @xmath152    0.7     0.7     so if we would have an efficient ` scheme ' to compute @xmath151 , then we would be able to compute our sequence - of - desire @xmath114 .",

    "but since we know _ a priori _ that @xmath170 satisfies _ some _ such recurrence , and it is extremely unlikely that its order is very high , confirming it for the first @xmath171 values consists a convincing _ semi - rigorous proof _ , that is easily rigorizable ( if [ stupidly ! ] desired ) .",
    "* added in revised version : * armin straub found a far slicker , less computer - heavy , way , to conclude this experimental mathematics proof .",
    "see [ str2 ] .",
    "but our main goal is to have @xmath0-analogs of the work in the article [ za ] that dealt with @xmath172-core partitions with distinct parts . in order to get data for the expectation , variance , and moments",
    ", we need an efficient way to generate as many terms of the sequence of _ straub polynomials _ , @xmath1 , defined by @xmath173 where the sum ranges over all @xmath0-core partitions with distinct parts , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 is the sum of the entries of @xmath174 ( i.e. the number of boxes in its young diagram ) .",
    "the maple package core.txt that accompanied [ za ] , and is also accompanying this article , uses dyck paths , and was able to find the first nine straub polynomials , @xmath1 , @xmath176 .",
    "it is based on an extension of the method described in [ ez ] , but keeping track of the fact that cells with adjacent labels are not allowed .",
    "so one has to put up with much more general families of paths , that are also parametrized by a set of ` forbidden labels ' .",
    "this causes an exponential expansion of memory and time .",
    "the approach that we take in this article , that easily produced the first @xmath2 straub polynomials , is a weighted analog of the above naive - enumeration scheme , and goes via order ideals .",
    "for an order ideal of @xmath177 let its _ weight _ be @xmath178    let @xmath179 be the set of order ideals of @xmath115 without neighboring labels ( i.e. if @xmath180 then both @xmath181 and @xmath182 are not in @xmath107 ) .",
    "let s define the two - variable polynomials @xmath183 define the ` umbra ' ( linear functional on polynomials of @xmath28 ) by @xmath184 and extended linearly . as shown by anderson ,",
    "once @xmath185 are known , we get @xmath1 by @xmath186 in other words , to get @xmath1 replace any power , @xmath187 , that appears in @xmath185 , by @xmath188 .    it remains to find an efficient scheme for ` cranking out ' as many terms of @xmath185 that our computer would be willing to compute .",
    "we first need a weighted analog of equation @xmath189 , i.e. the weight - enumerator of @xmath117 , but we need the extra generality where ( still with the smallest label being @xmath139 ) , for _ any _ positive integers @xmath112 and @xmath190 , in the vertical direction it is going down by @xmath112 , and in the horizontal direction it going down by @xmath191 ( drawing the lattice so that the highest label , @xmath192 is at the origin , and the vertex labeled @xmath139 is situated at the point @xmath193 , and the vertex labeled @xmath194 is situated at the point @xmath195 . note that the original @xmath117 corresponds to @xmath196 and @xmath197 .",
    "let s call this generalized weight - enumerator @xmath198 .",
    "it is readily seen that the weighted analog of eq .",
    "@xmath189 is @xmath199 with the initial conditions @xmath200 .",
    "let @xmath201 be the weight - enumerator of the lattice @xmath202 with horizontal spacing @xmath112 and vertical spacing @xmath203 .",

    "then the analog of eq .",
    "@xmath208 can be seen to be @xmath209 with the _ initial condition _",
    "@xmath210 when @xmath211 .    finally , the weighted analog of eq",
    "@xmath212 is @xmath213 with the _ initial condition _",
    "@xmath214 when @xmath211 .",
    "using the above scheme , one gets that @xmath215 @xmath216 @xmath217 @xmath218 @xmath219 @xmath220 @xmath221 @xmath222 @xmath223 @xmath224 @xmath225 @xmath226    for the straub polynomials @xmath1 for @xmath227 , see the webpage , or use procedure aspc(n , q ) in the maple package armin.txt mentioned above .    unlike the case of @xmath40-core partitions , whose number happened to be @xmath44 , and the explicit expressions for the expectation , variance , and higher moments involved expressions in @xmath228 and @xmath25 , the present case of @xmath0-core partitions into distinct parts , gives , surprisingly , ` nicer ' results .",
    "this is because , as conjectured in [ str1 ] and first proved in [ yqlz ] ( and reproved above ) , the actual enumeration is as simple as can be , namely @xmath47 .",

    "let us comment that we strongly believe that all the results here can be , _ a posteriori _",
    ", justified rigorously .",
    "the complicated functional recurrences for the straub polynomials ( before the `` umbral application '' ) entail , after taylor expansions about @xmath237 , extremely complicated recurrence relations for the ( pre- ) moments , whose details do not concern us , since we know that their truth follows by induction .",
    "the reason that we are not completely sure about this is that we do nt have a formal proof that `` polynomiality '' is preserved under the umbral transform . granting this ,",
    "each such identity is a _ polynomial identity _ , and hence its truth follows from plugging - in sufficiently many special cases . but that s how we got them in the first place . *",

    "we strongly believe that one can deduce from general , _ a priori _ , _ hand - waving _ ( yet fully rigorous ) considerations that this quantity is _ some _ polynomial of degree @xmath239 . hence it is enough to check it for @xmath240 .",
