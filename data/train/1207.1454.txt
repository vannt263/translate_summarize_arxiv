    "optical systems combining lossy and active elements provide a platform to implement analogues of non - hermitian @xmath0-symmetric quantum systems @xcite , which allows to realize unique optical switching effects @xcite .",
    "the wave scattering and dynamics in these systems provide an aspect which also permeates mesoscopic phenomena in microcavity lasers @xcite , coherent electronic transport @xcite , superconductivity @xcite , and quantum - chaotic dynamics @xcite .",
    "the main goal here is to relate how tools established in these disciplines can be used to approach the exciting spectral and dynamical features in @xmath0-symmetric optics .",
    "scattering theory @xcite , in particular , is ideally suited to deal with the complications of complex wave dynamics in multichannel situations , which appear when one goes beyond one - dimensional situations , and also easily accounts for any leakage if a system is geometrically open , as is often required by the nature of the desired optical effects , or because of the design of practical devices .",
    "we thus describe in detail how this approach can be applied to optical realizations of @xmath0-symmetric systems with a wide range of geometries @xcite .",
    "( for @xmath0-symmetric scattering in effectively one dimension see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .  @xcite . ) to formulate the approach under these conditions it matters whether a geometric symmetry inverts or preserves the handedness of the coordinate system , especially in the presence of magneto - optical effects ( vector potentials , which generally can not be gauged away beyond one dimension ) .",
    "an analogous bifurcation arises in the specification of the time - reversal operation .",
    "moreover , it is important to note that the fields defining a device geometry are external , a distinction from particle - physics settings which is reflected in the subtleties of onsager s reciprocal relations @xcite .",
    "thus the formulation of @xmath0 symmetry itself requires some care .",
    "in particular , an alternative appears , termed @xmath1 symmetry @xcite , which results in the same spectral constraints but imposes different physical symmetry conditions .",
    "the scattering approach also allows to restate the symmetry requirements in terms of generalized conservation laws @xcite , which we here extend to multiple channels .",
    "furthermore , the approach leads to effective models of complex wave dynamics which relate the spectral features to universal mesoscopic time and energy scales @xcite .",
    "we start this exposition with a brief recapitulation of the analogy between optics and non - hermitian quantum mechanics (  [ sec:2 ] ) , and discuss variants of geometric and time - reversal operations which can be used to set up @xmath0 and @xmath1 symmetry (  [ sec:3 ] and  [ sec:4 ] ) .",
    "we then describe how scattering theory can be applied to study the spectral features in these settings , first generally (  [ sec:5]-[sec:7 ] ) and then for a coupled - resonator geometry (  [ sec:8 ] ) .",
    "this leads to effective models (  [ sec:9 ] ) which can be formulated in the energy domain ( via hamiltonians ) and in the time domain ( via time evolution operators ) , and capture the relevant energy and time scales (  [ sec:10 ] ) .",
    "the concluding ",
    "[ sec:11 ] also describes possible generalizations of these models .",
    "the @xmath0-symmetric optical systems mentioned in the introduction cover a large range of designs , including coupled optical fibres , photonic crystals and coupled resonators , as depicted in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "some of the elements are absorbing while others are amplifying , and the absorption and amplification rates , geometry , and other material properties are carefully matched to result in a symmetric arrangement .",

    "( a ) two optical fibers .",
    "( b ) localized modes in a photonic crystals . ( c )",
    "coupled - resonator geometry . ]",
    "we concentrate on two common designs , effectively two - dimensional systems ( planar resonators or photonic crystals , with coordinates @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) as well as three - dimensional pillar - like systems ( such as arrangements of aligned optical fibers with a fixed cross section ) where the geometry does not depend on the third coordinate @xmath4 , and assume that the relevant effects of wave scattering , gain and loss can be subsumed in a refractive index @xmath5 , where @xmath6 signifies absorption ( loss ) while @xmath7 signifies amplification ( gain ) .",
    "later on , we also include an external vector potential @xmath8 representing magneto - optical effects .",
    "these assumptions allow to separate transverse magnetic ( tm ) and electric ( te ) modes , with the magnetic or electric field , respectively , confined to the @xmath9-plane ( thus transverse to @xmath4 ) .",
    "the electromagnetic field can then be described by a scalar wave function @xmath10 , which represents the @xmath4-component of the electric or magnetic field , respectively .",
    "one now arrives at two principal situations , which both serve as an optical analogue of non - hermitian quantum mechanics .      on the one hand",
    ", one can focus on the propagation in the @xmath9-plane , resulting in an effectively two - dimensional system which is described by a helmholtz equation @xmath11 the helmholtz equation is analogous to a stationary schrdinger equation , thus , an eigenvalue problem for the frequencies @xmath12 , which can become complex due to the loss and gain encoded in @xmath13 , or because of leakage at the boundaries of the system in the propagation plane .",
    "this then describes quasistationary states which decay ( @xmath14 ) or grow ( @xmath15 ) over time .",
    "on the other hand , one can focus on the propagation into the @xmath4-direction perpendicular to this plane , which is then often described by a paraxial equation @xmath16 here @xmath10 now is an envelope wave function , obtained after separating out a term @xmath17 .",
    "this equation remains valid if @xmath13 varies only slowly with @xmath4 , @xmath18 .",
    "the paraxial equation is an analogue of a time - dependent schrdinger equation , thus , a dynamical equation where an initial condition is propagated forwards  here , not in time , but along the spatial direction with coordinate @xmath4 .",
    "it is then natural to probe the system at an initial and a final cross - section , while the physical frequency @xmath12 is now real .",
    "as we assume that @xmath13 is @xmath4-independent , the paraxial equation is associated with the eigenvalue problem @xmath19 for the propagation constant @xmath20 .",
    "this eigenvalue problem shares all relevant mathematical features with the problem for @xmath12 ( in particular , the eigenvalues again can be complex because of loss , gain , and leakage in the system ) ; so do variants that rely on wave localization in the cores of optical fibers or wannier - like modes in a photonic crystal , with the gradient replaced by hopping terms . for definiteness",
    ", we shall employ notations adapted to the eigenvalue problem for @xmath12 .",
    "the investigation of symmetries in higher - dimensional systems of arbitrary geometry is a central aspect of mesoscopic physics . for hermitian systems ,",
    "a complete classification requires to take care of magnetic fields , internal degrees of freedom such as spin , pairing potentials and particle - hole symmetries @xcite .",
    "non - hermitian systems provide an even wider setting , with a mathematical classification , _",
    "e.g. _ , provided in ref . @xcite .",
    "in order to identify and specify the role of symmetries for their optical realizations we denote the operator in the wave equation by @xmath21 , which explicitly takes care of the functional dependence on the refractive index @xmath13 .      in @xmath0-symmetric quantum mechanics @xcite , the parity operator @xmath22 generally stands for a unitary transformation which squares to the identity . in optical systems , this operation",
    "is usually realized geometrically via an isometric involution , still denoted as @xmath22 , which inverts one , two , or three coordinates . to specify the consequences for the wave equation we promote @xmath23 to a superoperator ( we employ this notation as we will also encounter a transformation @xmath24 which does not correspond to an ordinary unitary or antiunitary operator ) . then @xmath25 = \\mathcal{l}(\\omega ; n(\\mathcal{p}\\mathbf{r})),\\ ] ] which should be read as a rule how to write the wave equation in the transformed coordinate system .",
    "the transformed equation is then solved by @xmath26 .",
    "conventional time reversal is implemented by complex conjugation in the position representation , which constitutes an antiunitary operation .",
    "we then have @xmath27 = \\mathcal{l}(\\omega^ * ; n^*(\\mathbf{r})),\\ ] ] which delivers a wave equation solved by @xmath28 .",
    "the wave equation now displays @xmath0 symmetry if the refractive index obeys @xmath29 .",
    "in this situation @xmath23 is an involution that interchanges amplifying and absorbing regions with matching amplification and absorption rates , and @xmath30 = \\mathcal{l}(\\omega^ * ; n^*(\\mathcal{p}\\mathbf{r } ) ) = \\mathcal{l}(\\omega^ * ; n(\\mathbf{r})),\\ ] ] which constraints the spectral properties of @xmath31 if the boundary conditions also respect the symmetry ( this is typically _ not _ the case if the system is open ) .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath32 then obey @xmath33 and thus either real ( @xmath34 ) if @xmath35 linearly depends on @xmath36 , or occur in complex - conjugate pairs ( @xmath37 ) if that is not the case .",
    "it is important to distinguish the conventional antiunitary time - reversal operation @xmath39 from another operation that is also often termed time - reversal @xcite .",
    "if @xmath40 were hermitian ( @xmath12 and @xmath13 both real with appropriate boundary conditions ) , then the action of @xmath39 could not be distinguished from the action of a superoperator @xmath41 acting in the position representation as @xmath42=\\mathcal{l}^t(\\omega ; n(\\mathbf{r})).\\ ] ] thus , @xmath41 transforms the right eigenvalue problem @xmath43 into the left eigenvalue problem @xmath44 .",
    "this delivers the same spectrum , and while the right and left eigenfunctions @xmath45 and @xmath46 for a given eigenvalue generally differ they are related by biorthogonality constraints . in the presently assumed absence of magneto - optical effects",
    ", @xmath41 is indeed an exact symmetry , @xmath47 and thus @xmath48 .",
    "this holds even if @xmath13 is complex , thus , even if @xmath39 symmetry is broken . in the non - hermitian case , therefore , these two operations are distinct and must be treated separately .",
    "in mesoscopic systems with complex wave dynamics , the alternative time - reversal operation @xmath41 governs a multitude of effects ranging from coherent backscattering and wave localization to minigaps in mesoscopic superconductors @xcite . to clarify the role of this operation we now consider magneto - optical effects , which are described by a ( possibly complex ) external vector potential @xmath8 that enters the wave equation through terms of the generic form @xmath49 . for this purpose",
    "we denote the operator in the wave equation as @xmath50 . as before",
    ", we continue to focus on effectively two - dimensional systems ; thus , @xmath51 , see and .",
    "the involution @xmath22 ( interpreted as a coordinate transformation of the wave equation ) transforms the external vector potential according to @xmath52({\\cal p}\\mathbf{r}))^2 $ ] , as @xmath23 is an isometry .",
    "thus@xmath53 = \\mathcal{l}(\\omega ; n(\\mathcal{p}\\mathbf{r } ) , [ \\mathcal{p}\\mathbf{a}](\\mathcal{p}\\mathbf{r } ) ) .\\ ] ] this analysis reveals an important feature of parity when applied to external fields , which sets them apart from internal fields that are often discussed in the setting of particle physics , and then are subject to additional explicit transformation rules .",
    "here we are interested in symmetries of a wave function @xmath10 that only accounts for the internal system dynamics , not for external components such as the motion of electrons in the inductors or the magnetic moments in the permanent magnets generating the field .",
    "this distinction is fundamental for onsager s reciprocal relations , which break down in the presence of external magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "the resulting magnetic field depends on whether @xmath22 preserves or inverts the handedness of the coordinate system , as @xmath54 $ ] .",

    "the optical systems considered here are naturally open , with leakage occurring , _ e.g. _ , at the fiber tips and waveguide entries , or because the confinement in the cross - section relies on partial internal reflection at refractive index steps or semitransparent mirrors .",
    "these systems can thus be probed via scattering @xcite , which delivers comprehensive insight into their spectral and dynamical properties and illuminates the consequences of the symmetries discussed above , as well as the role of multiple scattering addressed later on .",

    "the symmetries of a scattering problem are exposed when one conveniently groups the scattering states . to inspect @xmath23 we call half of the incoming states ` incoming from the left ' , and the other half ` incoming from the right ' .",
    "this does not need to be taken literally ; all what matters is that the two groups are converted into each other by @xmath82 .",
