    "most solar dynamo models use the scenario proposed by parker @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the solar magnetic field is produced by an interplay between differential rotation and the collective action of cyclonic turbulent convection flows .",
    "the latter is widely known as the @xmath0 effect @xcite , which is believed to be responsible for the generation of the poloidal component of the large - scale magnetic field ( lsmf ) of the sun .",
    "there are , however , a number of problems with the @xmath0 effect @xcite , and recent developments of mean - field magnetohydrodynamics have stimulated a quest for additional or alternative turbulent dynamo mechanisms .",
    "the influence of turbulence on the evolution of the lsmf is expressed by the mean electromotive force ( memf ) @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the fluctuating parts of the velocity and magnetic field ( angular brackets denote ensemble averages ) .",
    "it can be written in compact form as @xmath5 here @xmath6 is the mean , large - scale magnetic field .",
    "the tensors @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 describe the @xmath0 effect , turbulent pumping and turbulent diffusion , @xmath10 the @xmath11 effect ( or @xmath12 effect ) and @xmath13 the shear - current effect ( or @xmath14 effect ) .",
    "discussions of the different contributions to @xmath15 may , for instance , be found in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we use calculations of them as described in @xcite , and construct a set of axisymmetric kinematic dynamo models in a convective spherical shell . these models are obtained as solutions of the mean - field dynamo equation @xmath16 where @xmath17 , with @xmath18 modeling the differential angular rotation rate of the sun ( @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote radius and colatitude ) ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] , left - hand side in left panel .",
    "the lsmf is modeled in the form @xmath21 ( @xmath22 denotes the azimuthal unit vector ) , and the memf is calculated according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : emf ] ) .",
    "details of the procedure are given in @xcite .",
    "the radial profiles of characteristic quantities of the turbulence , such as the rms convective velocity @xmath23 , the correlation length and time @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the density stratification parameter @xmath26 ( @xmath27 is the mass density ) , are computed on the basis of a standard model of the solar interior @xcite .",
    "some of the generation effects depend on the rms intensity of a fluctuating background magnetic field @xmath28 , generated by a small - scale dynamo .",
    "we assume energy equipartition between @xmath28 and the turbulent velocity field , i.e. @xmath29 . the relative strengths of the turbulence effects are controlled via parameters @xmath30 ( @xmath0 effect ) , @xmath31 ( @xmath1 effect ) and @xmath32 ( shear - current effect ) ; in addition , turbulent pumping is always present , depending merely on the turbulence level ( with which all other contributions are also scaled ) .",
    "the integration domain is radially bounded by @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where the boundary conditions are @xmath35 at the bottom boundary , and vacuum conditions at the top boundary .",
    "four basic model quantities , namely , the differential rotation , the turbulent pumping velocity of the toroidal component of the lsmf and the radial profiles of the coriolis number @xmath36 ( @xmath37 is the surface rotation rate ) and of @xmath38 ( @xmath39 measures the strength of the azimuthal @xmath0 effect ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] .",
    "we now discuss examples of dynamos obtained by combining the @xmath0 effect with the @xmath11 and shear - current effects .",
    "it was found earlier @xcite that for solar conditions and without meridional circulation , @xmath40 dynamos ( @xmath11 effect plus differential rotation ) have steady non - oscillatory dynamo eigenmodes .",
    "we found that the same applies to @xmath41 dynamos ( shear - current effect plus differential rotation ) and to combinations of @xmath40 and @xmath41 dynamos .",
    "this means that the @xmath0 effect is needed in solar dynamo models , at least in such without meridional circulation .",
    "[ fig : stab ]       gives stability diagrams for @xmath42 and @xmath43 dynamos , which include the usual @xmath44 dynamo as a limiting case .",
    "as is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] , in this latter case the dipole modes are not the most unstable modes . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ]    shows snapshots of the evolution of the lsmf in the @xmath44 dynamo and the associated butterfly diagram , obtained from the first unstable dipole eigenmode .",
    "we assume that the sunspot activity is produced by the toroidal lsmf in the whole convection zone and have integrated the toroidal field over radius .",
    "the obtained dynamo has some similarity with the observed evolution of the large - scale magnetic activity of the sun , e.g. , the `` correct '' phase relation between the toroidal and poloidal components  the polar reversal of the radial component of the lsmf takes place when the amplitude of the toroidal component passes its maximum , and the toroidal fields drift towards the equator in the course of the activity cycle .",
    "there are a number of problems , however .",
    "two of them are : ( i ) the period of the activity cycle is @xmath45 ( corresponding to about 0.1 turbulent diffusion times ) , which is much shorter than the observed period of 22yr .",
    "( ii ) the activity maxima are found at mid latitudes , rather than , as observed , at low latitudes .",
    "the inclusion of the two additional turbulent generation mechanisms of the poloidal lsmf reduces the frequency of the dynamo wave .",
    "[ fig2 ]    demonstrates this for the example of an @xmath42 dynamo .",
    "oscillatory modes are excited if @xmath30 is not very small compared to @xmath31 . in the range @xmath46 the match with the solar observations is best . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : stab ] , the dipole modes are the primary dynamo modes in this parameter interval . while the wings of the obtained dynamo waves are too wide , other qualitative properties , such as the drift directions of the toroidal and poloidal components of the lsmf and their phase relation , are reproduced correctly .",
    "the period of the dynamo in this parameter range is shorter than but comparable with the turbulent diffusion time .    our last example is a dynamo where the poloidal lsmf is built up with the help of the shear - current effect .",
    "[ fig3 ]    shows the time evolution of the lsmf and the associated butterfly diagram for an @xmath43 dynamo model .",
    "some properties of the model agree well with the observations .",
    "for example , the period of the dynamo waves is comparable with the turbulent diffusion time .",
    "also , the maximum amplitudes of the toroidal component of the lsmf are found below @xmath47 latitude , and this field component drifts towards the equator during the cycle .",
    "a very unwelcome issue of the model , however , is that the maxima of the radial component of the lsmf are also concentrated near the equator .",
    "the inclusion of the @xmath1 and shear - current effects in addition to the @xmath0 effect and differential rotation in axisymmetric kinematic dynamo models alleviates some of the known problems of current mean - field solar dynamo models .",
    "for instance , the simulated period of the dynamo is increased and comes , thus , closer to the observed activity period .",
    "furthermore , the large - scale toroidal field is concentrated towards the equator , thus bringing the models in better agreement with the observation of two activity belts relatively close to the equator .",
    "improved diagnostic tools based on both observation and theory are needed to clarify the roles of the different turbulence effects , as well as that of meridional circulation , which was not included in the present study ."
