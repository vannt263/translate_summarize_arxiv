    "most quasars display properties which are entirely consistent with their radio flux density being caused by synchrotron emission ( e.g. begelman et al . 1984 ) . for high source intensities a second radiation process ",
    "inverse - compton scattering  must also be an important energy - loss mechanism for the relativistic electrons .",
    "this competing process limits the synchrotron intensity of any static radio source to brightness temperatures @xmath6 ( kellermann & pauliny - toth 1969 ) .",
    "a brightness temperature can be deduced from flux density variations , the time scale of which is taken to indicate the size of the source .",
    "thus , much interest has been aroused in recent years by the phenomenon of intraday variability ( idv ) of radio sources , where the inferred brightness temperatures are many orders of magnitude higher than the inverse compton limit  see wagner & witzel ( 1995 ) for a review .",
    "it is not yet understood how such high apparent brightness temperatures arise .    in order to investigate the idv phenomenon further , we carried out a survey of 125 compact southern radio sources at four frequencies ( 1.4 , 2.4 , 4.8 and 8.6  ghz ) , using the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) . here",
    "we present our observations of one source , pks  0405385 , which stood out from all others by virtue of the extreme rapidity and large amplitude of its variations ( kedziora - chudczer et al .",
    "our data are described in  2 , and the theoretical deductions presented in  3 .",
    "pks 0405385 is a compact , inverted - spectrum radio quasar with a redshift z=1.285 ( peterson & bolton 1972 ; vron et  al .",
    "its optical spectrum exhibits strong , broad emission lines , with an absorption system at z=0.875 ( hunstead 1996 ) .",
    "available vlbi data indicate that the source has no radio structure on scales larger than 1  milli - arcsec .",
    "its linearly polarized flux density does not exceed 3% of the total intensity for any of our observed frequencies .",
    "intraday variability of pks 0405385 was first observed in 1993 november during our atca idv survey . at that time",
    "the strongest and fastest flux density changes were observed at 8.6 ghz ( 17% peak - to - peak within 24 hours ) . in 1994",
    "may we found 20% peak - to - peak flux density excursions in 2 hours ( our sampling interval ) at 2.4 ghz .",
    "we monitored pks 0405385 continuously with the atca on 1996 june 7 and realized immediately the unique nature of its flux density variations .",
    "figure 1 shows the flux density variations of pks  0405385 , as measured by the atca at four frequencies over 90 hours .",
    "data were collected simultaneously for two frequency pairs : either 1.4 / 2.4  ghz or 4.8 / 8.6  ghz .",
    "we switched between these two pairs every 10 min .",
    "independent confirmation of the rapid variability of pks 0405385 came almost immediately from hartebeesthoek radio astronomy observatory ( hartrao ) measurements at 5.0 and 8.4  ghz .",
    "these data are shown in figure  2 . within a week",
    ", further confirmation of our result was provided by observations with the nrao s very large array ( vla ) , at 8 and 22  ghz .    at 4.8 and 8.6",
    "ghz the variations are quasi - sinusoidal , and there is strong correlation between these two frequencies , with no detectable time lag .",
    "the time scale of the variations is much greater at 2.4 and 1.4 ghz , and the amplitude of variability is smaller .",
    "the fractional rate of change of flux density for pks  0405385 is over 50% per hour at 4.8  ghz . for comparison",
    "the swiftest observed flux density change in the idv source 0917 + 624 at 2.7 ghz ( qian et al .",
    "1991 ) was 1.5% per hour while the fastest variation seen in oj 287 in 11 days of observations ( de  bruyn 1988 ) was 5% per hour at 5 ghz .",
    "figure  3 displays the modulation index of pks  0405385 as a function of frequency .",
    "the vla data for 22  ghz are also plotted .",
    "the vla flux densities at 8 and 22  ghz appeared well correlated but the fractional variability was almost a factor of three smaller at 22  ghz .",
    "however , the interval covered by the vla was too short to show the full extent of the variations .",
    "we used these data only to determine the modulation index at 22  ghz as a ratio of modulation indices at 8 and 22  ghz from vla data , combined with the 8  ghz modulation index obtained from the atca data .    continued monitoring of the radio flux density of pks  0405385 at the atca and hartrao showed that the rapid variability persisted for several weeks beyond the initial discovery",
    "remarkably , the variations then disappeared ; they were present at full strength on july 2 and entirely absent on july 21 . in its steady condition , the flux density of the source settled on a value which , at each frequency , was close to the maximum values previously seen during the variable phase .",
    "analysis of sparse atca archival data indicates that the rapid variability is episodic .",
    "we are currently monitoring pks  0405385 on a daily basis .",
    "our preliminary analysis indicates that the flux density of the source is steadily rising  over 10% in 2 months starting from 1996 july when the rapid variability ceased .",
    "the brightening is strongest at 4.8  ghz .    we were unable to investigate the possible correlation between the optical and radio variability , as has been claimed for other idv sources ( quirrenbach et al .",
    "1989 ) due to inclement weather .",
    "no variations in the optical r - band flux could be seen in data taken with the 2.3 m telescope of the mount stromlo and siding spring observatories in 1996 august , during a period of radio quiescence . however , pks  0405385 has been reported to vary at mm wavelengths as measured with the 15 m swedish eso submillimetre telescope ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) .",
    "previous examples of idv ( cf .",
    "wagner & witzel 1995 ) stimulated theories based on either intrinsic mechanisms or line - of - sight effects . in the latter category one",
    "has gravitational microlensing ( wagner & witzel 1995 ) and interstellar scintillation ( rickett 1990 ; rickett et al .",
    "1995 ) , while intrinsically high brightness temperatures might arise from relativistic shock waves propagating in a synchrotron source ( qian et al .",
    "1991 ) , or from coherent ( non - synchrotron ) radiation processes ( e.g. baker et al .",
    "1988 ) .      to explain an inferred brightness temperature of @xmath0 in terms of a beamed synchrotron source , bulk motion with lorentz factor @xmath7 is required .",
    "this is much larger than any of the values ( @xmath8 ) measured for superluminal sources with vlbi imaging ( cf . vermeulen & cohen 1994 ) .",
    "the difficulties associated with explaining idv in terms of ultra - relativistic beaming are considered in detail by begelman , rees and sikora ( 1994 ) .",
    "although several proposals have been made for coherent emission mechanisms ( colgate 1967 ; baker et al .",
    "1988 ; lesch & pohl 1992 ) there are no entirely satisfactory theories for such emission in active galaxies and quasars . in the current picture of how quasars generate their power  that is , accretion of matter onto a massive black hole  any hypothesised radiation of very high brightness temperature ( @xmath9 ) is expected to suffer severe attenuation as a consequence of stimulated electron scattering within the source ( coppi , blandford , & rees 1993 ) .",
    "when the line - of - sight to the source passes through a foreground galaxy , gravitational microlensing can occur as a consequence of the small - scale structure in the gravitational potential  due , for example , to individual stars .",
    "for pks  0405385 , this possibility is made particularly interesting by the observation of an absorption - line system , at lower redshift , in the optical spectrum (  2 ) .",
    "however , our vlba data show that pks  0405385 is not multiply imaged by any intervening galaxy , so we expect the optical depth to gravitational microlensing to be small .",
    "this means that any microlensing events should show up as isolated events on an otherwise steady baseline ; moreover , the event time - scale ought to be much longer than is observed for pks  0405385 , unless the source moves with an apparent superluminal transverse speed @xmath10 .      a second possible extrinsic effect is due to the turbulent motion of the random , small - scale structure in the ionized interstellar medium ( ism ) . adopting the ` standard ' theoretical description  involving a kolmogorov spectrum of inhomogeneities , with no inner or outer scale within the regime of interest",
    " one arrives at predictions for the broad - band modulation indices of a point source . these are ( narayan 1992 ) : @xmath11 for @xmath12 , i.e. in the ` strong ' scattering regime , and @xmath13 for @xmath14 ( the ` weak ' scattering regime ) .",
    "( note , however , that these are asymptotic results which are not strictly valid in the regime @xmath15 . ) further , from existing models of the interstellar medium ( see particularly taylor & cordes 1993 ) we can estimate the transition frequency for this line of sight to be @xmath16  ghz .",
    "the predicted modulation index incorporates only one free parameter , the fraction of the total source flux density in the most compact component ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "we obtained the best fit of the observed modulation index behaviour assuming @xmath18 for all frequencies .",
    "the results are plotted in figure 3 .",
    "it is clear from this that there is generally good agreement with the data , despite the simple nature of our model of a scintillating point source plus non - scintillating extended component .",
    "we estimate the angular size of the source , @xmath19 , as follows .",
    "the ism along this line of sight is distributed over a distance of order 1  kpc from us . in the weak scattering regime , which is relevant to our 5 and 8  ghz observations ,",
    "the source size should be comparable to , or smaller than , the first fresnel zone of the equivalent `` phase screen '' , in order that substantial variability be observed , whence @xmath20 . for @xmath21  ghz and adopting a screen distance of 500 pc ,",
    "we find @xmath22 5 @xmath3arcsec .",
    "this limit is much smaller than the milli - arcsec dimensions usually found for quasar cores , and would imply that pks  0405 - 385 is the most compact radio quasar yet found .    in turn",
    ", the size of the first fresnel zone and the observed time scale for the variations , @xmath23  hours , tells us the velocity of the inhomogeneities in the ism relative to the line of sight . here",
    "km s@xmath25 compared with the 30  km s@xmath25 of the earth s orbital speed around the sun .    at frequencies less than 5",
    "ghz the variability time scale increases rapidly with wavelength and the modulation index gradually decreases , as expected for scintillation in the strong scattering regime .",
    "however , the sampling window for our data does not permit us to make good quantitative estimates of the variability timescales at 1.4 and 2.4  ghz .",
    "the observed time scale for flux density variations is determined by a characteristic transverse velocity at the distance of the origin of the variations . in the present model ,",
    "interstellar scintillations reproduce the observed variability time scale as a direct consequence of the screen being nearby .",
    "speeds of the order of @xmath26  km s@xmath25 suffice in the ism where d @xmath27  pc , whereas ultra - relativistic motions are implied for variations introduced at cosmological distances .    within the scintillation interpretation",
    "we have estimated an upper limit on the component size of @xmath2  @xmath3arcsec , if it has a flux density of 0.24  jy at 4.8  ghz .",
    "this requirement translates to a brightness temperature of @xmath28  k. in the presence of relativistic motion , the former measurement transforms as @xmath29 ( where @xmath30 ) .",
    "hence bulk motion with doppler factor of the order of @xmath31 would be implied for both intrinsic and scintillation explanations for the variability , if we interpret the high brightness temperature as being a consequence of relativistic beaming .",
    "the transient behaviour of pks  0405 - 385 variability opens up the possibility that the inverse compton limit might , for a short time , be greatly exceeded in this source ; we note that the light travel time across a 5 @xmath32arcsec at z@xmath331 is of the order of a month . in this circumstance",
    "it might not be necessary to have recourse to extreme levels of relativistic beaming .",
    "we suggest that the transient behaviour is due to the ( dis)appearance of the very compact component in pks  0405 - 385 . assuming this component is a core with a size of @xmath2  @xmath3arcsec",
    ", it will clearly scintillate .",
    "the core structure is likely to evolve , increasing in size to the point where it becomes sufficiently large that scintillations cease .",
    "this could occur through the ejection of an expanding jet , in which case the flux density would also likely increase at the same time , thus providing a natural explanation for the high values of the quiescent flux density observed when the scintillations ceased in 1996 july .",
    "when the jet becomes transparent at ghz frequencies , the point - like core may appear again , causing the reappearance of scintillations .",
    "confirmation of these suggestions will have to wait until the scintillations reappear and we can follow their evolution in detail .",
    "our observations of pks 0405 - 385 raise the immediate question why such extreme variability has been observed in only this one source out of the large number of known radio quasars ?",
    "the simple answer may be that radio quasars are generally not this compact , and are limited to angular sizes greater than a few tens of @xmath3arcsec at ghz frequencies .",
    "such variability has been found only as a result of intensive monitoring campaigns , and could easily have been missed for other agns through less frequent sampling and through the transient nature of the variability . a definitive answer to the question",
    "will need more extensive monitoring of many more sources .    in summary ,",
    "we have observed profound variability in the radio quasar pks 0405 - 385 on timescales much shorter than anything previously seen in an extragalactic source .",
    "these variations can be understood as due to interstellar scintillation which , in turn , requires that the source be very intense , for periods of about a month , with brightness temperature @xmath34  k well above the inverse compton limit .",
    "alternative explanations require sources which are sufficiently small in angular dimensions that they will scintillate in any case ( rickett et al.1995 ) .",
    "it is evident that pks  0405 - 385 will be a most interesting target for the current space vlbi missions vsop ( hirosawa 1991 ) and radioastron ( kardashev & slysh 1988 ) .",
    "we thank the director and staff of the vla for promptly securing ` target of opportunity ' observations of this source .",
    "we are also grateful to don melrose and alan marscher for useful discussions , dick hunstead for his optical line identifications , and katrina sealey for acquiring a confirmation spectrum .",
