    "the basic geometry of the experimental setup ( see fig.[setup ] ) is given by a vapor cell separated from a uhv - chamber by a differential pumping tube which is also the aperture for the output beam of cold atoms .",
    "a two - dimensional magnetic quadrupole field is produced by four coils with rectangular shape .",
    "the axis of both , the cell and the tube , coincide with the line of zero magnetic field .",
    "four perpendicularly counterpropagating laser beams with orthogonal circular polarisations in the usual mot - configuration enclose a cooling volume along the axis of zero magnetic field ( z - axis ) .",
    "the center of the mot laser beams is positioned about 4 cm in front of the differential pumping tube .",
    "the cooling volume extends to the entrance of the tube .",
    "atoms in the vapor cell which enter the cooling volume are slowed down in the two radial dimensions and are compressed to the z - axis .",
    "the atoms velocity in the longitudinal direction is not cooled .",
    "hence the atoms experience a skew trajectory into the center of the 2d - mot , according to the equation of motion of a damped harmonic oscillator , while propagating along the axis .",
    "this produces a thin , dense , well collimated atomic beam in two directions , namely in the positive and negative z - direction .",
    "we constrict ourselves to one beam travelling in the positive z - direction , where it passes through the differential pumping tube .",
    "the other beam is lost after it hit the back wall of the glass cell .",
    "+ the atoms in the vapor cell have to fulfill three criteria simultaneously in order to contribute to the flux of laser - cooled slow atoms at the exit of the differential pumping tube : + a ) the initial radial velocity component needs to be smaller than the transverse capture velocity of the 2d - mot .",
    "+ b ) the interaction time of the atoms with the light field needs to be long enough so that the trajectory of the atom hits the entrance of the differential pumping tube ( the radial velocity is sufficiently cooled ) such that its divergence is small enough to make it to the exit of the tube .",
    "+ c ) the mean free path in the vapor cell should be larger or comparable to the length of the 2d - mot , so that the cooling of the atoms has not suffered from collisions .",
    "+ at first we consider the collision - less regime . here",
    "the density is low enough that the mean free path in the vapor cell is larger than the dimensions of the cell . in this case",
    "we can assume that the thermal atoms start on the walls and no collisions take place in the volume .",
    "the geometry of the tube and the glass cell is designed in such a way that the opening angle of the differential pumping tube does not accept atoms starting on the side walls without being transversely cooled . in this",
    "configuration thermal atoms are only transmitted if they start on that part of the back wall of the glass cell which lies within the acceptance angle of the differential pumping tube .",
    "this choice limits the thermal background .",
    "+ for an understanding of the total flux and its dependence on the geometry , the longitudinal velocity profile of the atomic beam needs to be investigated .",
    "this information is given by the range of accepted velocity classes and its dependence on external parameters .",
    "the concept of a capture velocity , well - known from 3d - magneto - optical - traps , must be modified to embrace the 2d - mot - configuration .",
    "since the cooling is restricted to transverse velocities , we define a radial capture velocity .",
    "in spherical 3d - mots the capture velocity has a constant value depending only on detuning , laser beam size and intensity and on the magnetic field gradient .",
    "however , in a 2d - mot a finite cooling time is necessary to collimate the atoms onto the beam axis .",
    "atoms which travel too fast along the z - direction can not be sufficiently cooled and are filtered out by the aperture .",
    "a main parameter is therefore the cooling time @xmath10 which is given by the longitudinal velocity @xmath11 and the distance @xmath12 from the tube at which the atom enters the cooling volume of the 2d - mot .",
    "thus the effective transverse capture velocity becomes a function of @xmath12 and @xmath11 . for small @xmath11 the radial cooling time dominates and",
    "the capture velocity should be simply a constant @xmath13 determined by the parameters of the cooling laser beams and the magnetic field gradient .",
    "for larger @xmath11 the capture velocity should fall off as @xmath14 .",
    "the velocity range between these two asymptotes depends additionally on the position @xmath15 where atoms enter the cooling volume . with increasing cooling length",
    "one should expect more atoms with high axial velocities to be transversely cooled and transmitted through the tube .",
    "+ the cooling time @xmath16 determines the final transverse velocity : @xmath17 . here",
    "@xmath18 is the spontaneous scattering force , @xmath19 the initial , @xmath20 the final radial velocity and @xmath21 the mass of a rb - atom . by that the divergence of the atomic beam ( if it is not limited by the acceptance angle of the tube ) is shaped depending on the mean length of the cooling volume .",
    "radial cooling within a finite cooling time increases the portion of atoms with small v@xmath22 in the beam .",
    "_ this is the reason why the velocity distribution of the atomic beam is non - thermal and is shifted to much lower values than a thermal distribution _ at room temperature ( @xmath23@xmath2275 m/s ) although there is no longitudinal cooling .",
    "a typical time scale for the cooling time is 1 - 2ms .",
    "as will be described in part [ experiment ] , a usual length of the cooling volume in our setup is about 60 mm .",
    "this gives a rough estimation for the mean velocity in the atomic beam between 30 and 60 m/s .",
    "+ the influence of the mot - laser intensity is reflected in the efficiency of the transverse cooling .",
    "the capture velocity should increase with intensity and saturate at some value when the saturation parameter dominates the spontaneous force .",
    "+ the vertical beam size , in combination with detuning and magnetic field gradient , determines the radial capture velocity @xmath13 .",
    "an increase of the length of the 2d - mot increases the upper limit of the longitudinal velocities which are trappable . additionally , the size controls the mean longitudinal velocity in the beam of cold atoms which increases with increasing mot - length .",
    "hence the total flux should grow with the length of the 2d - mot . in the limit of an infinitely long 2d - mot the longitudinal velocity distribution of the atom beam becomes equal to a thermal distribution .",
    "+ without collisions the number of trappable atoms and thereby the flux increases with a higher pressure in the vapor cell .",
    "+ let us now discuss the effect of collisions . at higher pressures their evolution creates a thermalization of the atoms in the volume of the vapor cell .",
    "thereby atoms can now start not only from the walls but also from within the vapor cell .",
    "this increases the background of thermal atoms in the atomic beam .",
    "moreover background gas collisions in the vapor cell and light assisted collisions of excited atoms in the beam with the background gas are mechanisms that limit the flux when the mot - length increases . the mean number of collisions is given by the product of an ensemble averaged collision rate @xmath24 and the mean time @xmath25 which the atom spends in the cooling volume .",
    "@xmath26 is the density in the vapor cell , @xmath27 the collision cross section and @xmath28 the mean thermal velocity in the vapor cell .",
    "the longer the mot is , the longer becomes the time of propagation which the atoms spend in the vapor cell .",
    "therefore the higher is the probability for losses due to collisions such that a further increase of mot - length does not produce a higher flux . in this simple picture",
    "the flux is supposed to saturate as a function of mot - length .",
    "the mean velocity should increase since atoms with small @xmath11 are more vulnerable by collisions .",
    "+ for a given mot geometry an increasing pressure will decrease the effective length of the cooling volume .",
    "therefore one should expect an optimum pressure for a given geometry of the 2d - mot , namely when the mean free path in the vapor cell becomes comparable with the length of the cooling volume .",
    "in addition higher densities in the vapor cell lead to a higher absorption of the light beams and decrease the cooling efficiency .",
    "+ for a theoretical description of the flux of cold atoms from a 2d - mot source we resort to a simple rate model which was introduced in @xcite for vapor - cell mots and later expanded for atomic beam sources in @xcite . based on that model for the total flux",

    "only positive values for @xmath11 are taken into account .",
    "+ in order to derive the loading rate for a 2d - mot , one needs to consider the flux of atoms through the surface of the cooling volume .",
    "since we are interested in the loading flux through the side walls , we need to consider only radial velocities , weighted with that part of the boltzmann distribution which is trappable according to the discussion above .",

    "this gives for the flux per velocity interval : @xmath53 at residual vapor pressures of a few @xmath54 mbar the typical lifetime of a mot loaded from atomic beams is about 100ms .",
    "from that we conclude a collision rate @xmath32 on the order of 10s@xmath55 for this vapor pressure .",

    "the underlying physics is pure two - dimensional cooling and trapping . to reach a high flux with a small divergence we work at high vapor pressures and with a long cooling region .",
    "the length of the 2d - mot provides good collimation ( divergence @xmath77 32mrad ) and a mean velocity of 50 m/s .",
    "the high vapor pressure assures a large loading rate and thus a high flux . to be able to work at pressures in the range of @xmath92 mbar we work with four separate counterpropagating cooling laser beams .",
    "the total flux is in the range of several @xmath93 atoms per second .",

    "+ this alternative source of atoms provides a total flux comparable to a zeeman slower with less total length , less material throughput and without disturbing light and magnetic fields for a consecutive mot in a uhv system and therefore provides a very good starting point for further laser and evaporative cooling experiments and bec - generating apparatus @xcite .",

    "<S> especially the process of evaporative cooling @xcite demands a high atom number as a starting point for reaching quantum degeneracy . </S>",

    "<S> the figure of merit characterizing the performance of our system is the integrated brightness which is about @xmath9atoms/(s@xmath7srad ) . on the other hand one needs to accept a rather high mean velocity of the cold beam and a relatively broad velocity distribution depending on the chosen geometry . </S>",
