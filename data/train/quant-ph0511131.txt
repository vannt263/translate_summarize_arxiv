    "it is one of the central open questions in the field of quantum computing if quantum algorithms can efficiently solve computationally hard problems in combinatorial optimization .",
    "the most common problems of this kind encountered in practice belong to a so - called np - complete class @xcite and are in almost one - to - one correspondence with the spin glass models in physics @xcite .",
    "a basic property of these models is an onset of an exponentially large number of deep local minima of the energy landscape formed by spin configurations separated by a large number of spin flips .",
    "a general framework for solving optimization problems on a quantum computer is provided by an adiabatic quantum computation ( aqc ) @xcite . in its simplest form aqc",
    "corresponds to a `` quantum annealing '' ( qa ) of a spin system in the uniform transverse magnetic field described by a smoothly - varying in time hamiltonian @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath2 is proportional to the transverse field strength ; @xmath3 is a pauli matrix for the @xmath4 spin . the first term in ( [ h ] ) is called a driver \" , it causes transitions between the eigenstates of the problem hamiltonian @xmath5 whose ground state encodes the solution of the classical optimization problem in question .",
    "for example , to find the ground state of the classical ising model one uses @xmath6 where @xmath7 are longitudinal fields acting on spins and the summation is over the pairs @xmath8 of coupled lattice sites .",
    "in qa the value of @xmath9 is slowly decreasing in time from a large value @xmath10 at the start , to @xmath11 at the end of the algorithm . the initial state is prepared to be a ground state of @xmath12 with each spin pointing in the positive x - direction . for",
    "adiabatically slow variation of @xmath13 the system state will be closely tracking the instantaneous ground state @xmath14 at the end of the algorithm and the solution of the optimization problem can be recovered by measurements .",
    "a metric for the performance of the aqc can be given in terms of the minimum value @xmath15 of the excitation gap @xmath16 between the ground and first excited energy levels of @xmath17 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath18 grows no faster then polynomially in the problem size @xmath19 then so does the runtime of aqc .",
    "it was demonstrated recently for aqc applied to computationally hard random instances of np - complete satisfiability problem that the algorithm performance is substantially affected by the existence of the first - order quantum phase transition for some value of @xmath20 in the limit @xmath21 @xcite . in this limit",
    "the instantaneous gap averaged over the ensemble of random problem instances vanishes , @xmath22 .",
    "this produces a significant difficulty in the analysis of the asymptotic complexity of aqc .",
    "indeed , assume that for a given problem instance @xmath23 of a finite size @xmath19 the minimum gap is achieved at some value of @xmath24 .",
    "for large @xmath19 the distribution of the values of @xmath25 over the ensemble of random problem instances @xmath23 is peaked around @xmath26 and has a width @xmath27 .",
    "therefore the minimum of the ensemble - averaged excitation gap , @xmath28 , will scale down polynomially with @xmath19 . at the same time",
    "the ensemble average of the minimum gap @xmath29 can be exponentially small in @xmath19 .",
    "the above discussion implies that , in general , the order of time - minimization ( over @xmath2 ) and statistical averaging of the excitation gap over the ensemble of problem instances _ can not _ be inverted",
    ". therefore static properties of the quantum phase transition ( e.g. , a phase diagram ) are not sufficient to obtain the true asymptotic complexity of aqc and a daunting theoretical task of studying the _ dynamics _ of the phase transition is required .",
    "an crucial insight here can be gained from the experiments implementing aqc for problem instances of a large size .",
    "an early work on this subject is a quantum annealing experiment @xcite .",
    "it uses the macroscopic samples of a disordered magnet liho@xmath30y@xmath31f@xmath32 with the dipolar coupling between the spins that are formed by the doublet states of ho@xmath33 ions randomly substituted for nonmagnetic y@xmath34 .",
    "when the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the ising axes the system can be approximated by the hamiltonian @xmath35 ( [ h]),([hp ] ) corresponding to a quantum 3d ising model with the random antiferromagnetic interaction between neighboring spins in the transverse magnetic field @xmath36 .    for @xmath11 finding a ground state of @xmath35 can be mapped onto an np - complete problem @xcite .",
    "however this mapping is only approximate for the random magnet @xcite because it is not exactly of the ising type due to the very small components of the g - factor transverse to the ising axis .",
    "also the analog computation via qa @xcite if of a low - fidelity type because it does not have any explicit control nor correction of the decoherence - induced errors , unlike the conventional quantum computation schemes based on quantum circuits .",
    "finally , the adiabatic evolution in qa @xcite collapses beyond the point @xmath37 of a quantum phase transition from a quantum paramagnet to a quantum spin glass where the system escapes from the adiabatic ground state to states with low - lying energy levels forming a quasi - continuous spectrum @xcite .",
    "despite all these shortcomings the magnetic susceptibility study in @xcite and the subsequent numerical simulations of this system @xcite shows that qa provides a dramatic speedup of convergence to low - energy states of liho@xmath30y@xmath38f@xmath32 over a purely thermal annealing procedure at zero transverse magnetic field .",
    "this was attributed to the fact that the tunnelling processes between local minima of the energy landscape open up new transition pathways as compared to thermally activated spin flips .",
    "the decoherence rate for the lowest doublet ( spin ) states in ho ions comes from the coupling to ho nuclei and is small @xcite,@xcite(a ) , possibly much smaller then the level splitting and magnetic dipolar coupling between the neighboring ho spins @xcite .",
    "one can expect that the success of qa is based substantially on a strong build - in quantum coherence with extremely entangled many - spin states and quantum correlations extending out over large group of spins ( cf .",
    "@xcite(b ) ) .",
    "all np - complete problems can be mapped onto one another by a classical algorithms that scale polynomially in the problem size @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "however different problems correspond to spin hamiltonians with quite different physical properties , such as long - range _ vs _ short - range interactions , fully - connected _ vs _ sparsely - connected graphs , etc .",
    "therefore it would be of a fundamental importance to experimentally study the properties of qa in mesoscopic systems modelling different np - complete problems at @xmath11 .",
    "this can shed a light on the power of qa even if the experiments are of a low - fidelity type @xcite .",
    "however one has to overcome several obstacles to implement this approach :    1 .",
    "many np - complete problems correspond to a long - range interaction between classical spins while the underlying physical systems have short - range interactions ; 2 .   in most of the perspective material systems",
    "the coupling between qubits is either difficult or impossible to control .",
    "the former includes systems with superconducting qubits @xcite and the latter includes systems with magneto - dipole @xcite , electro - dipole @xcite , and and elastic - dipole @xcite interactions ; 3 .",
    "irregularities of the crystal lattice and random spatial positions of qubits give rise to the fluctuations in magnitude and sign of the qubit coupling coefficients across the sample .",
    "kaminsky , lloyd and orlando ( klo ) @xcite proposed a novel aqc architecture for solving np - complete maximum independent set problem using superconducting qubits . in their method",
    "an instance of the problem is converted into an equivalent circuit with ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings in a uniform magnetic field . in @xcite",
    "switchable interqubit couplings using one of the mechanisms presented in @xcite are necessary for encoding an instance of mis , but the architecture does not require a change in couplings during the algorithm execution for a given problem instance .    at the same time the couplings in @xcite have to be readjusted for solving a new instance of mis problem .",
    "also the scalability of this is limited because it only allows the switching between the regimes of small and large couplings .",
    "i.e. , it can not guarantee that two sites are completely decoupled , nor the sign of the coupling can be changed .",
    "in what following we propose the architecture for aqc that assumes that qubit couplings are _ not _ adjustable and addresses all the problems ( i)-(iii ) mentioned above .",
    "moreover the architecture that we propose for solving various np - complete problems via aqc is universal , in a sense that it is independent on any particular qubit implementation .",
    "for practical implementation of aqc for solving an optimization problem it is necessary to translate this problem into a model hamiltonian with single - spin and pairwise interactions only .",
    "it is especially straightforward to do for the np - complete graph theory problem maximum independent set ( mis ) @xcite .",
    "this problem is defined on a graph @xmath39 that is composed of the set of vertices @xmath40 connected by edges from the set @xmath41 .",
    "mis is the problem of finding the largest subset @xmath42 of vertices @xmath40 such that no two vertices on the subset share an edge from @xmath41 .",
    "the reason why this problem is well suited form aqc is that its solution is isomorphic to finding a ground state of an antiferromagnetrically coupled ising spin model in a uniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the next obstacle has to do with the fact that we want to use spins on a 2d lattice and use only nearest - neighbor interactions .",
    "if the graph is non - planar it can not be embedded into 2d lattice with nearest - neighbor interactions only . and",
    "there is no guarantee that a graph just constructed has a drawing on a plane without intersecting edges . fortunately using a construction invented by garey , johnson and stockmeyer",
    "@xcite we can replace two intersecting edges by a gadget of fig .",
    "[ fig : gadget ] . maximizing",
    "the independent set in the gadget reveals opposite vertices can not both be occupied without incurring energy penalty .",
    "solving mis problem for the transformed graph gives the solution for the original one .",
    "replacing all instances of intersecting edges by such gadget renders the graph planar . for this reason , without losing generality , we can restrict our discussion to planar graphs .",
    ", width=288 ]    before we describe the embedding of planar graph into a regular 2d lattice let us demonstrate how the mis problem maps onto ising model .",
    "we model vertices of the graph with classical ising spins that can take values @xmath43 .",
    "the edges correspond to antiferromagnetic interactions between spins .",
    "consider the following classical hamiltonian : @xmath44 where @xmath45 corresponding to antiferromagnetic interaction and local magnetic fields are @xmath46 ( the sum is over the neighbors of a vertex @xmath47 ) .",
    "this expression can be ( up to a constant ) rewritten as @xmath48 since all interactions are antiferromagnetic ( @xmath45 ) and @xmath49 , we must have @xmath50 .",
    "the minimum value @xmath51 is reached only if no edge @xmath52 has both @xmath53 and @xmath54 . in other words",
    "the set of vertices @xmath55 is independent , no two vertices from this set share a vertex .",
    "hence , the minima of @xmath56 are all possible independent sets .",
    "next , we adjust individual magnetic fields @xmath57 , which is equivalent to adding a perturbation @xmath58 its role is to maximize the number of vertices with @xmath53 , i.e. maximize the cardinality of mis . by choosing @xmath59",
    "we guarantee that all minima of @xmath60 correspond to independent sets with @xmath51 . indeed , if for some minimum of @xmath60 and for some @xmath61 both @xmath53 and @xmath54 , then setting @xmath62 decreases @xmath56 by at least @xmath63 and at the same time increases @xmath40 by @xmath64 . the overall energy decreases by at least @xmath64 contradicting our assumption that we started from a minimum of @xmath60 . therefore",
    ", the ground states of @xmath60 correspond to solutions of mis problem .",
    "moreover , the gap between ground state(s ) and first excited state(s ) is at least @xmath64 .",
    "obviously , very few planar graphs can be drawn on a lattice , with vertices corresponding to the nodes of the lattice and edges corresponding to nearest - neighbor links .",
    "in general case vertices have to be represented by whole clusters of spins .",
    "we generalize hamiltonian ( [ eq : h0 ] ) as follows .",
    "we label spins by two indices ; in addition to cluster index @xmath47 , we have index within a cluster @xmath65 : @xmath66 .",
    "similarly , interactions are denoted by @xmath67 which can be either ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic .",
    "restrictions on signs of interactions will be explained later , while as before we require @xmath68 . within each cluster ,",
    "the graph of interactions is a connected tree . between clusters",
    "there is at most one link , and the link between clusters @xmath47 and @xmath69 is present if and only if there is an edge joining vertices @xmath47 and @xmath69 . this construction is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : clust ] for a simple graph .    '' and `` @xmath70 '' signify values of corresponding @xmath71 ; solid and dashed lines represent ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions respectively .",
    "[ fig : clust],width=288 ]    the fact that the graph of interactions within a cluster is a tree means that when considered separately , each cluster has a doubly degenerate ground state .",
    "we identify them with values of fictitious coarse - grained spin @xmath72 .",
    "value @xmath73 shall indicate that vertex @xmath47 is included in the independent set .",
    "the individual spins take values @xmath74 for appropriate @xmath75 .",
    "clearly @xmath76    in principle , values of @xmath71 can be deduced from @xmath77 via the last equation , but in practice this will not be necessary since their values will be evident from the construction .    between different clusters an interaction must be effectively antiferromagnetic . if there is a link between @xmath66 and @xmath78 , we require that @xmath79 so that @xmath72 and @xmath80 are coupled antiferromagnetically .    consider the hamiltonian @xmath81 here in the first term the double summation is over the clusters @xmath47 and over all edges @xmath82 within each cluster . in the second term",
    "the summation is over all pairs of distinct clusters @xmath83 connected by an edge @xmath84 .",
    "individual fields @xmath85 in ( [ h0sum ] ) can be adjusted so that @xmath56 is rewritten ( up to a constant ) as @xmath86 with @xmath87(it can be verified that all signs above are correct given the inequalities ( [ ineq1 ] ) and ( [ ineq2 ] ) ) . in the above equations",
    "both @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the ground state of @xmath56 corresponds to @xmath90 and @xmath91 . the first equality @xmath90 implies @xmath92 for all @xmath65 , @xmath93 or , equivalently , @xmath94 for all @xmath65 .",
    "with this constraint in mind , @xmath95 can be rewritten into a familiar form @xmath96 .",
    "then @xmath91 implies that no two vertices @xmath61 that are joined by an edge belong to the independent set at the same time ( @xmath97 is forbidden ) .",
    "we now estimate the gap between ground states and excited states . if @xmath98 it must be at least @xmath99 ; and if @xmath100 it is at least @xmath101 .",
    "therefore the gap is at least @xmath64 .",
    "the degenerate ground states of @xmath56 correspond to all possible independent sets .",
    "this degeneracy is ( partially ) lifted by adding a term to @xmath56 @xmath102 where @xmath103 is some arbitrary index within a cluster .",
    "this corresponds to adjusting @xmath104 .",
    "alternatively , rather than pick up a particular spin @xmath105 we can adjust @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is the size of cluster @xmath47 .",
    "then @xmath108 in either case , the net effect is that the extra term takes a form @xmath109 , which favors independent sets with the largest cardinality ( number of vertices with @xmath73 is maximized ) .",
    "we need only to verify that the perturbation @xmath40 is small enough to not mix the ground states and excited states of @xmath56 .",
    "if either @xmath110 or @xmath95 is positive , then , for all spins within the corresponding cluster @xmath47 we set @xmath111 ( this is equivalent to setting @xmath112 ) .",
    "this decreases the energy by at least @xmath64 as we have already estimated . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy increase due to degeneracy - breaking term is at most @xmath113 .",
    "we conclude that the minima of @xmath56 involve only independent sets , and that the energy gap is at least @xmath113 .",
    "once we have constructed a classical hamiltonian @xmath56 ( [ h1])-([v1 ] ) the ground state of which corresponds to the solution of np - complete mis problem , we formulate a quantum hamiltonian @xmath0 ( [ h ] ) for use in the aqc by replacing in @xmath56 all classical spins @xmath66 with operators @xmath114 ( cf .",
    "( [ hp ] ) ) and adding a driver term @xmath115 .",
    "as explained in the previous section , only planar graphs have to be considered . also note that only connected graphs can be considered ; for disconnected graphs we may solve the problem for each connected component .",
    "every vertex of the planar graph is mapped onto a cluster of vertices and edges forming a tree .",
    "this allows vertices far from each other to be joined .",
    "also we must always preserve an antiferromagnetic character of interactions between the vertices to satisfy the inequality ( [ ineq2 ] ) .",
    "an arbitrary planar graph can be mapped onto an appropriately sized regular lattice of spins with nearest neighbor interactions , as long as such system has a frustration ( loops with odd number of antiferromagnetic couplings must exist ) .",
    "this is a necessary condition since the ground state of a non - frustrated system is trivially obtained , whereas a ground state of np - complete problems typically has an exponentially large degeneracy , with degenerate states unrelated to each other by symmetry transformations .    for illustrative purposes",
    "we now embed a graph in a triangular lattice with antiferromagnetic interactions ( so that each plaquette is frustrated ) , but such that every antiferromagnetic coupling can be switched off by an external control .",
    "a straightforward construction of a graph embedding is via iterated procedure .",

    "we extend the clusters corresponding to the vertices adjacent to @xmath47 and link them to @xmath47",
    ". a completely blind procedure may not always work .",
    "let us call the vertices from @xmath35 eligible  if they are adjacent to the vertices from @xmath121 that do not belong to @xmath35 ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "links from eligible vertices to some new vertex will have to be drawn at later stages .    in the case of a non - convex embedding of a subgraph @xmath35",
    "we may encounter a situation where there are not enough qubits in 2d lattice to draw all links from the new vertex to eligible vertices ( see fig.[fig : bottleneck ] ) .",
    "we can guarantee that this never happens if we use the following guidelines : we always expand clusters corresponding to eligible vertices so that the embedding remains convex , eligible vertices lie on the perimeter of this convex region , and a minimum distance between eligible vertices along the perimeter is maintained .    ,",
    "width=288 ]    for the triangular lattice we make sure that the convex object always has the form of a triangle .",
    "the distance between the eligible vertices along the perimeter must be at least two . adding a vertex that is joined to subgraph @xmath35 by only one edge increases the side of the triangle by 1 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : em1 ] ) , and adding a vertex joined by two or more edges to subgraph @xmath35 can increase the side of the triangle by 2 for the worst - case scenario depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : em2 ] .    , width=288 ]    , width=288 ]    we now explain figs .  [",
    "fig : em1 ] and [ fig : em2 ] in more details .",
    "large black circles lying on a boundary of the triangle describe the eligible vertices ; connections to them may have to be made at a later stage . in fig .",
    "[ fig : em1 ] one vertex is added joined to the current subgraphs by one edge .",
    "it must be coupled antiferromagnetically to a cluster corresponding to neighboring vertex @xcite .",
    "a copy  of the neighboring vertex is made since more vertices may connect to it later on .",
    "the cluster associated with that vertex is expanded to include that copy .",
    "similarly , copies of all eligible vertices on the same side of the triangles are added to corresponding clusters .",
    "note that copies of vertices are coupled ferromagnetically , whereas new vertex is coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "this guarantees that for all large black circles the corresponding values of @xmath123 and the inequalities ( [ ineq1]),([ineq2 ] ) are satisfied . in fig .",
    "[ fig : em2 ] a new vertex is connected to 3 vertices of the subgraph @xmath35 .",

    "no copy of the middle vertex is made  it can not be connected to new vertices as long as we add vertices in correct order .",
    "fortunately , under the iteration in both cases a minimum distance of 2 between eligible vertices is maintained .",
    "let us now make some estimates . for a connected planar graph with @xmath19 vertices and @xmath124 edges the following inequality holds : @xmath125 due to this tight bound ,",
    "@xmath19 alone is a good measure of the size of a graph .",
    "let us now estimate the number of qubits needed in our construction .",
    "adding each consecutive vertex may increase the side of the triangle by @xmath126 .",
    "a single vertex is represented by a single qubit .",
    "a triangle of size @xmath127 has @xmath128 qubits .",
    "this presents an upper bound on the number of qubits needed to model a planar graph with @xmath19 vertices .",
    "note that we have used qubits quite liberally .",
    "we hope that far smaller number of qubits may be required for practical implementation , possibly a number scaling linearly with @xmath19 .",
    "minimization of this number is an interesting topic for further study .",
    "the construction that we provided requires the programmability of nearest - neighbor interactions ( i.e. , the ability to switch them off ) .",
    "embedding of np - complete problems can only be done into the lattices that possess frustration .",
    "an antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice is always frustrated and therefore only the ability to switch off antiferromagnetic interactions is necessary in this case .",
    "however for a square lattice , switching between ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic and zero couplings is necessary . this is because for a square lattice neither ferromagnet nor antiferromagnet has a frustration that requires the presence of interactions of both signs .",
    "antiferromagnetic triangular lattice with adjustable interactions can be implemented in superconducting qc by one of devices described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the idea to use them for implementing aqc was first put forward by kaminsky , lloyd and orlando @xcite . however",
    "the approach described in @xcite can not be used when switching between 3 states ( ferromagnetic , antiferromagnetic and zero coupling ) is needed .",
    "moreover , the switching is not precisely between antiferromagnetic and zero couplings but rather between strong antiferromagnetic and weak antiferromagnetic couplings . while this is adequate for small graphs , for graphs that are sufficiently large ( @xmath129 ) , presence of weak antiferromagnetic coupling can lead to appearance of spurious minima unrelated to the correct solution of mis problem .",
    "this effect can be compensated by grouping vertices in larger clusters and grouping links between qubits in these clusters in larger bundles .",
    "this approach is analogous to using thick wires  , which increases @xmath130 ratio for effective interactions .",
    "this approach , however , is ridden with complexities . and",
    "most importantly , as was argued in introduction , in many physical systems it is crucial to have an aqc architecture that does not rely _ at all _ on tunable interactions .",
    "this is precisely what we propose to accomplish in this paper .",
    "the general idea of our approach is the following .",
    "instead of deleting  couplings between nodes of the regular lattice we propose to delete vertices . by applying a large ( effective ) magnetic field to a particular qubit @xmath47",
    "we can polarize it along the @xmath131 direction ( to value @xmath132 ) .",
    "magnetic fields for its neighbors are adjusted as follows @xmath133the net effect is the same as if qubit @xmath47 was completely absent ( not coupled to its neighbors ) . since",
    "this operation can be applied to any qubit , we can start from a regular lattice and by selecting a set of qubits to be deleted appropriately , we carve out \" a desired circuit .",
    "note that , although we so far assumed that spins at deleted vertices are completely polarized , corresponding to infinitely large magnetic fields , in practice we only require that spins be completely polarized in the ground state of the classical hamiltonian .",
    "for that purpose it is sufficient to use magnetic fields on the order of @xmath113 , defined as @xmath134 .",
    "we identify several solutions for implementing this .",
    "first general approach is to use one lattice where individual nodes are deleted \" to simulate another lattice with switchable interactions .",
    "the simulated lattice will have a larger lattice constant .",
    "therefore a larger number of qubits is required . as a first example of this approach we take a square lattice with a particular periodic structure as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : old2 ] . in this figure",
    "solid lines correspond to ferromagnetic and dashed line to antiferromagnetic couplings .    ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : tri ] we divide all qubits into four sets .",
    "`` deleted '' qubits are represented by empty circles ; the severed couplings are represented by dotted lines .",
    "`` working '' qubits , depicted by large black circles correspond to the nodes of triangular sublattice .",
    "unused `` auxiliary '' qubits represented by small black circles effectively `` pass on '' interaction to their neighbors .",
    "the `` control '' qubits represented by gray circles are used to selectively enable or disable antiferromagnetic couplings between working qubits . deleting gray control qubit switches off an interaction between two working qubits that otherwise are effectively coupled antiferromagnetically . as a next step",
    "we apply our construction for embedding a planar graph into a triangular lattice .",
    "note that since for every working qubit we use 2 auxiliary , 3 control qubits and 2 deleted qubits , our estimate for the number of qubits is correspondingly increased by a factor of 8 .    ]    for illustrative purposes we give another example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sq ] .",
    "this time a square lattice in which every plaquette is frustrated is mapped onto another square lattice with a lattice constant that is @xmath135 times larger .",
    "now the control qubits can be used not only to switch off the interaction but also to choose its sign .",
    "couplings between a pair neighboring working qubits is controlled by two control qubits .",
    "deleting both control vertices severs the interaction between the two working qubits , while deleting only one makes an interaction effectively ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic , depending on which vertex was deleted .    ]",
    "yet another approach is to do graph embedding directly on a lattice .",
    "we choose a particular square lattice with frustration where each plaquette has 1 edge of one type ( ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic ) and 3 edges of another type .",
    "as before , we construct the embedding interactively . assuming that we constructed an embedding for a subgraph of the original graph so that all eligible vertices lie on the side of the square , we couple the new vertex antiferromagnetically to some of these eligible vertices .",
    "this can always be done since we are free to reroute the connections at will .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dir ] . control qubits as before are represented by gray circles . for left and right edges",
    "we delete either gray qubit .",
    "for the center edge we either delete qubit 2 or both qubits 1 and 3 .",
    "a simple counting argument shows that since there is a total of 8 choices for control qubits , exactly one will correspond to all couplings being effectively antiferromagnetic .",
    "this procedure increases the side of the square by @xmath136 in the worst case , taking the total number of qubits necessary to @xmath137 in the worst case .",
    "as before we stress that this is the worst - case scenario and the estimate will be lowered if better layout algorithms are used .    ,",
    "for nanoscale computing architectures it is important to take into account irregularities of the crystal lattice . for classical processing units in molecular computing",
    "the following solution was proposed @xcite .",
    "a massively parallel array of simple computational devices is used , but in contrast to standard architectures , interconnects between devices are redundant ( note that both devices and interconnects can be defective ) . the presence of redundant connections allows to reroute the system once defective elements are identified .",
    "perfectly working system was implemented despite the fact that 10% of elements were defective .",
    "the present aqc architecture , in which individual qubits are `` deleted '' by polarizing them is perfectly suited to address the problem of fault - tolerant computation . in our model",
    "only a small subset of nearest - neighbor couplings are utilized . from this standpoint ,",
    "the system has large redundancy of links .",
    "a computer program , given database of defects , can achieve routings that bypass defects altogether .",
    "this can be easily illustrated as follows .",
    "assume for simplicity that only the following defects can occur : ( i ) a particular nearest - neighbor coupling is too small in absolute value , @xmath138 for some threshold @xmath113 ( see eq .",
    "( [ perturbation ] ) and discussion after it ) ; ( ii ) a particular nearest - neighbor coupling has a wrong sign , ferromagnetic when it should be antiferromagnetic or _",
    "vice versa_. in either of those cases we mark one of the qubits as `` defective '' , delete it and route all links around it as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig : def ] .",
    "similarly , we can route around qubits that are themselves defective .",
    "this can be done as long as individual defects are isolated and their concentration is not too big . in general , it should be possible to reroute around the defects as long as their concentration does not exceed the percolation threshold .    , width=288 ]    moreover , it is possible to do the routing algorithm even when dealing with an entirely random pattern .",
    "the number of possible routings increases exponentially with their length and with high probability we can always find at least one routing that makes couplings effectively antiferromagnetic .",
    "we expect that this can be done with the number of qubits that differs only by a constant factor compared to the case of regular pattern .",
    "there exists a number of requirement for the implementations of the above aqc architecture for solving np - complete problems .",
    "firstly , the underlying spin lattice must have frustration .",
    "secondly , an interaction between spins must be of the ising type , @xmath139 .",
    "thirdly , in our analysis above we assumed only a nearest - neighbor ising coupling .",
    "the above requirements can be satisfied for qubits coupled via the heisenberg exchange interaction , superconducting qubits , and , except for the last condition , in many systems with always on \" magnetic - dipole and electric - dipole interqubit coupling .    to see this we consider the hamiltonian @xmath140 for magnetic coupling between the two spins-1/2 located in the plane @xmath141 and subject each to a strong static magnetic field @xmath142 ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "also each spin is resonantly driven by a weak ac magnetic field @xmath144 applied in the orthogonal direction .",
    "assuming that the difference between the values of the zeeman splitting for the two spins is much greater then their magnetic coupling we obtain in the rotating wave approximation @xcite @xmath145\\ , \\hat \\sigma_{1}^{z}\\ , \\hat \\sigma_{2}^{z},\\label{h12}\\ ] ] @xmath146 @xmath147 where @xmath148 in ( [ h12 ] ) we neglected small terms proportional to @xmath149 which amount to corrections quadratic in @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath152 and @xmath153 are magnetic - dipole and heisenberg exchange constants , respectively .",
    "both of them are positive and correspond to antiferromagnetic interaction between spins .",
    "therefore if spins are located at the vertices of a triangular lattice the later will be frustrated .    by adjusting the amplitudes of the resonant driving fields @xmath154",
    "one can set the effective transverse field @xmath155 for all spins except for the deleted \" spins where there is no ac driving ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "also each ac field @xmath157 is not a sequence of short pulses but rather a continues wave . during the aqc the field detuning from resonance @xmath158",
    "is fixed while the field matrix element @xmath36 is decreased adiabatically slow in time .",
    "this can be achieved using various methods for a single spin qubit control , such as modification of the electron g - factor @xcite , and others that are discussed in the context of the spin - based qc in quantum dots @xcite and shallow donors @xcite .",
    "consider now a triangular lattice of charge qubits where each qubit @xmath65 is encoded by the two orbital states with the wave functions @xmath159",
    "( @xmath160 ) and the difference between the energy levels equals @xmath161 .",
    "we assume that the only nonzero dipole matrix elements for each qubit correspond to a z - component of the electric dipole vector , @xmath162 .",
    "consider now a pair of qubits _ 1 _ and _ 2 _ located in @xmath141 plane on a distance @xmath163 from each other and assume that the strength of the electro - dipole interaction between them @xmath164",
    ". then the truncated 2-qubit interaction hamiltonian has the form @xmath165 , where @xmath166 are z - components of effective spin-1/2 operators acting on qubit states and @xmath167 is a constant of an electro - dipole interaction ( cf .",
    "this interaction is of an antiferromagnetic \" type and will lead to frustration on a triangular lattice of qubits located in @xmath141 plane .    in a usual qc",
    "setting we assume that a control electrode is located near each qubit and apply a time - modulation of the potential of the local electrodes that produces weak microwave fields with the frequencies @xmath168 .",
    "the z - component of each field will drive resonantly the transition between the corresponding qubit states in a near - field regime . then in the rotating wave approximation @xmath169 will take a form ( [ h12 ] ) ( @xmath170 ) with @xmath158 and @xmath2 being , respectively , a detuning from the resonance and a non - diagonal matrix element of the field for a qubit @xmath117 . by fixing @xmath171 and slowly reducing the value of @xmath2 to zero one can implement the aqc architecture similarly to the previous case .",
    "the example given above is relevant for the charge qubits encoded by electron states lithographically confined on a surface of liquid helium @xcite , and also by laterally quantized electron states in single - electron quantum wells in gaas heterostructures @xcite .",
    "a main limitation of the proposed architecture for systems with dipole - dipole interactions is that it takes into account only nearest - neighbor interqubit couplings .",
    "we note however that in our approach each vertex of the graph in mis problem is embedded in a cluster with a large number of qubits .",
    "this picture may effectively support the nearest - neighbor coupling approximation .",
    "the detailed analysis of this problem will be done elsewhere .",
    "another challenge of the implementation schemes considered above is that frequencies of resonant driving @xmath172 must be different for different qubits and therefore each qubit has to be driven with its own ac field ( in near - field regime ) . for frequency range @xmath173 10@xmath174 hz",
    "this can be done by modulating the gate bias near each qubit .",
    "this condition can be satisfied for electrons on helium @xcite , for electronic states in broad quantum dots @xcite and for spin qubit control via the g - factor modulation @xcite .",
    "however for qubits encoded by orbital states of a shallow donors in gaas @xcite with the long decay time ( @xmath175 350ns ) the intra - qubit frequencies @xmath176 are in the thz range and local ac driving is highly problematic .",
    "one could consider in this case a global driving with the thz field containing a range of frequencies within the spectral window that overlaps with the intra - qubits frequencies @xmath177 so that each qubit will be driven resonantly by its own frequency component of the field .",
    "fixed detuning @xmath158 can be produced locally for each qubit using a quadratic stark effect from the field of the control electrode .",
    "in the proposed aqc architecture the interactions between qubits are never turned off and never re - adjusted for solving any given instance of an np - complete problem . moreover",
    ", the problem instances can be embedded into the underlying ising lattice even in the presence of site imperfections and random distribution of the magnitudes of the ising coupling coefficients .",
    "also in the proposed scheme there is no need to perform nmr - type refocusing sequences of fast qubit gates that are used in conventional quantum computing ( qc ) architectures @xcite and must satisfy the stringent conditions reflecting the multiple time scales in the material system . in contrary , in our approach the computation process is guided with the slow continues - time variation of the parameters of single - qubit hamiltonians avoiding unwanted resonances with bulk excitations .",
    "these considerations make our analog scalable aqc architecture especially advantageous for solid state qc implementations that use `` always on '' magnetic- @xcite and electric - dipole @xcite interactions for entanglement generation .",
    "this architecture is also of interest for qc implementations that use the heisenberg exchange interaction , such as electron spin qubits in quantum dots @xcite .",
    "it will allow to avoid an inter - qubit j \" gate , or any electrical control over the wavefunction overlap , hence making a gate lithography much simpler and reducing the sensitivity to electrode noise .    for future work",
    "we leave the mapping of an instance of the maximum independent set problem onto an arbitrary planar graph , edges of which represent the couplings between qubits .",
    "it would allow us to work with completely random systems that do not have any periodic structure .",
    "though the problem of deciding whether a certain instance can be mapped onto an arbitrary planar graph is likely np - complete , we only need to find a good approximation algorithm , which can be designed to take polynomial time and guarantee to find such a mapping for sufficiently large random planar graph with high probability .",
    "we chose to implement a maximum independent set problem because the problem uniquely permits fluctuations in the magnitude of @xmath178 , as long as the sign is unchanged .",
    "for practical problems involving the solution of constraint satisfaction problem the problem is often first transformed into an instance of a maximum independent set .",
    "although a mapping from constraint satisfaction to maximum independent set exists , it may be beneficial to work with a constraint satisfaction problem from the outset .",
    "we have described earlier that every clause that involves three variables can be replaced by the gadget in the form of planar graph .",
    "mapping this directly onto ising model will reduce the number of extra vertices and edges necessary .",
    "maximum independent set problem limits our possibilities as it assigns equal weight to every vertex that appears in the independent set . relaxing this constraint leads for more efficient architectures for simulating a clause or for a gadget that replaces crossing edges .",
    "recently oliviera and terhal developed a mapping of an _ arbitrary _ quantum circuit onto a square lattice with nearest neighbor interactions of three possible types : @xmath179 , @xmath180 , @xmath181 , or no coupling at all @xcite .",
    "this opens door for emulating an arbitrary quantum computing algorithm as aqc with all spins on a 2d square lattice .",
    "the construction done in @xcite is rigid : every quantum circuit corresponds to a particular lattice .",
    "it is interesting to explore if our approach of polarizing qubits to carve out  circuits out of standard pattern can be applied in the case where couplings @xmath182 and @xmath180 appear alongside @xmath181 , and to find out what might be the optimal standard pattern . in addition",
    "it is interesting to explore if the same can be accomplished starting off from a completely random pattern .",
    "if a standard pattern is sufficient ( provided we can adjust fields acting on individual qubits ) , it may be a very practical approach for solid - state implementations of a universal quantum computer and could be programmed to implement shor s factoring algorithm .",
