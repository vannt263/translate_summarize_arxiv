    "advances in quantum optics have increased the attention to protocols using light as a quantum information carrier  @xcite .",
    "information can be encoded in different degrees of freedom of the electromagnetic field , such as amplitude and phase . in order to encode and process information ,",
    "a medium is necessary to intermediate the interaction between two ( or more ) electromagnetic fields .",

    ", the interaction between fields and atoms also modifies the properties of light .",
    "these modifications can be measured by a technique called noise spectroscopy .",
    "this high - resolution spectroscopic technique was introduced by yabusaki and collaborators  @xcite to study the d1 and d2 absorption spectra of rubidium and cesium atoms .    since its introduction",
    ", there has been a large number of experiments on noise spectroscopy in vapor cells . among others groups",
    ", we employed this technique to observe correlations and anti - correlations in the fluctuations of two laser beams after interacting with an atomic vapor at room temperature fulfilling the conditions for eit  @xcite .",
    "however , the observations in this kind of sample always suffer from doppler broadening , which mixes the contribution of atoms from different velocity classes , or even different transitions , in the detected signal . as a consequence ,",
    "the interpretation of the observed signals becomes considerably more complicated  @xcite .",
    "a clearer picture of the process , with a straightforward comparison between theory and experiment , is obtained by using cold atomic ensembles for such correlation measurements , since these systems have virtually no doppler broadening and the different transitions can be easily isolated from each other . in this work ,",
    "we investigate a technique for correlation spectroscopy which is power broadening free .",
    "we perform an in - depth study of such correlation spectra in cold samples of two different alkali atoms , rubidium and cesium , as a function of detuning and intensity of the fields .",
    "the cold samples are obtained from magneto - optical traps ( mot ) .",
    "this mapping provides a detailed description of the dynamics in frequency space of both correlations and anti - correlations for eit - like atomic systems .",
    "as previously observed in vapor cells @xcite , an interesting feature of these systems is that the width of the eit correlation peak does not depend on the intensity of the exciting fields . in ref .",
    "@xcite we found a simple physical interpetration for this and other crucial features of the problem , where we explored only same - time correlations between the two eit fields .",
    "this temporal approach has clear advantages for the intuitive understanding of the signal , but it is susceptible to spurious electronic noises over a large band of frequencies . a much better signal - to - noise ratio may be obtained by working in frequency space , selecting a single analysis frequency for which we have particularly low electronic noise . for this reason ,",

    "the model predicts quite well most of the observed features , confirming that the above theoretical approximations , including the assumption of three - level atoms , were enough to capture the essential aspects of the problem .",
    "an interesting difference between theory and experiment is that the correlations are typically higher in the experimental data .",
    "we understand this difference as coming from our assumption that we have a thin sample , since a thicker sample could in principle induce even more correlation .",
    "another difference is the asymmetry of the spectrum around the central correlation peak .",
    "this could not be reproduced by our simple theory , and it might come from different optical pumping conditions over the atomic zeeman structure as the detuning is changed .",
    "the dislocation from zero detuning of the correlation peak can be easily understood as coming from a residual magnetic field in the direction of propagation of fields 1 and 2 , which dislocates the two - photon resonance uniformly over the whole ground - state zeeman structure .",
    "another relevant feature in the experimental correlation spectra of last section is that the central correlation peak width remains unchanged over a wide range of rabi frequencies .",
    "this is clearly revealed in the comparison between dc - signal and correlation - coefficient spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig : rbdchfcorr_signal ] , which presents significant broadening for the dc signal and no power broadening for the correlation coefficient .",
    "the same behavior is observed in the theoretical data of fig .",
    "[ fig : teobroad ] , which was plotted in a situation close to the conditions of fig .",

    "in this work we measured the noise correlation spectrum using two different samples of cold atoms in eit regime . the correlation spectroscopy was done in two different systems using different techniques .",
    "the use of cold atoms allowed the direct access to a specific eit resonance , and we could discard the effect of other transitions , present in doppler - broadened samples .    we have successfully shown that correlation spectroscopy provides a direct measurement of the coherence linewidth in this eit transition , being insensitive to power broadening in the studied range of intensities .",
    "the simple model we used , relying in a three level system , was sufficient to describe the main features observed in more complex zeeman manyfold eit structures , for different atomic media .",
    "although the richness of the involved structures limits the model to a qualitative description of the problem , in a 3-level @xmath0 system it should provide a quantitative agreement with the experiment .",
    "moreover , the use of spectral analysis in the detection process provided a clearer signal than the temporal approach previously used , and a real - time reading of the coherence lifetime .",
    "this is a crucial step for developing metrological applications from this technique .",
    "it can also be applied for the optimization of the coherence time for atomic memories used in quantum information protocols .",
