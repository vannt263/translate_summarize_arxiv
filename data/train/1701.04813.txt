    "a _ jigsaw puzzle _ is a collection of square pieces where each of the four edges of a piece has a shape , referred to as a _ jig _ , so that it fits together with a subset of the edges of the other pieces .",
    "an _ edge - matching puzzle _ is a collection of square pieces where each side of every piece is given a color .",
    "the goal of the respective puzzles is to assemble the pieces into a certain form , in this paper this will always be an @xmath0 square , such that all pairs of adjacent pieces fit together . in the case of a jigsaw puzzle",
    ", this means that the jigs of edges that are aligned next to each other should have complementary shapes , and for an edge - matching puzzle , such pairs of edges should have the same color .",
    "here we assume that the pieces are allowed to be rotated , but not flipped upside down .    in order to make this a bit more formal ,",
    "we assume that there are @xmath1 possible types of jigs , enumerated from @xmath5 to @xmath1 .",
    "a jig type can either be symmetric , so that it fits together with itself , or be part of a pair of complementary types that fit together with each other .",
    "we can describe this relation by fixing a map @xmath6 from @xmath7 to itself such that @xmath8 and a jig of type @xmath9 fits with jigs of type @xmath10 .",
    "note that we can consider an edge - matching puzzle as a special case of a jigsaw puzzle by taking @xmath6 equal to the identity map . in a recent paper by mossel and ross @xcite ,",
    "a simple model for random edge - matching puzzles , later generalized to random jigsaw puzzles in @xcite , was proposed .",
    "we imagine that we start with an @xmath0 grid of identical unit squares . for each of the four sides of each piece ,",
    "we choose its color , or type of jig respectively , out of @xmath1 possibilities , under the restriction that pairs of connected sides must get the same color / complementary jig types .",
    "note that this means that , unlike most real jigsaw puzzles , also edges along the boundary are assigned colors / jigs .",
    "we will refer to such an assignment of colors to a puzzle as a _ coloring _ , and an assignment of jig types as a _",
    "carving_. the authors asked , suppose we chose one such puzzle uniformly at random , then what is the probability that the puzzle can be uniquely recovered from the shuffled collection of pieces ?",
    "further , how can this recovery be done efficiently ?",
    "they called this problem shotgun assembly of a random jigsaw puzzle due to its similarity to genetic shotgun sequencing , which is a technique for sequencing a long dna strand by sampling random subsequences .",
    "the notion of `` unique recovery '' needs some elaboration .",
    "we consider a solution of the puzzle to be a positioning and orientation of the pieces into a fixed @xmath0 grid such that all adjacent pieces fit together .",
    "the solution consisting of all original positions and orientations will be referred to as the _ planted assembly_. we here assume that , besides the choice of jigs / colors , all pieces are identical and rotationally symmetric .",
    "hence any solution to the puzzle is equally likely to be the planted assembly .",
    "as the pieces can be rotated , the best we could ever hope for is to be able to recover the planted assembly up to a global rotation of the puzzle .",
    "besides that , the puzzle may contain duplicate pieces , that is , two pieces with identical colors / jigs , or rotationally symmetric pieces , that is , opposite sides have the same colors / jig types .",
    "note that such pieces automatically give rise to additional , albeit not very different , solutions to the puzzle .",
    "we say that two solutions of a puzzle are _ similar _ if they only differ by a global rotation , permutation of duplicate pieces , and rotation of rotationally symmetric pieces , or , equivalently , if the solutions have the same coloring / carving up to global rotation . in the terminology of @xcite ,",
    "a puzzle has _",
    "unique vertex assembly _ ( uva ) if the only solutions are the four global rotations of the planted assembly , and a puzzle has _",
    "unique edge assembly _ ( uea ) if all solutions are similar .",
    "it was shown by mossel and ross @xcite that , with high probability , a random edge - matching puzzle as above has at least two non - similar solutions when @xmath11 , and has a unique solution up to global rotation when @xmath12 .",
    "recently , two papers , bordenave , feige and mossel @xcite , and nenadov , pfister and steger @xcite , considering this problem were published on arxiv.org , both on may 11:th 2016 , and both proving essentially the same result : for @xmath13 , a random edge - matching puzzle has a unique solution up to global rotation with high probability for any fixed @xmath14 , and for @xmath15 there are duplicate pieces with high probability and hence multiple , but possibly all similar , solutions .",
    "it should be noted that the paper by bordenave et al . assumes that the pieces are not allowed to be rotated , but remarks in the last section of the paper how their argument can be modified slightly , both to allow rotations and to generalize to the random jigsaw puzzle model above .    concerning the problem of how to recover the planted assembly efficiently , bordenave et al .",
    "describe an algorithm that recovers it with high probability when @xmath16 with time complexity @xmath17 . as a comparison ,",
    "the general problems of finding one solution to a given @xmath0 jigsaw puzzle or edge - matching puzzle are known to be np - complete @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "the problem also seems to be hard in practice . in the summer of 2007 ,",
    "a famous edge - matching puzzle , eternity ii , was released , with a $ @xmath18 million prize for the first complete solution @xcite .",
    "this puzzle consists of @xmath19 square pieces that should be assembled into a @xmath20 square .",
    "there are in total @xmath21 edge colors , not including the boundary , which is marked in gray .",
    "the competition ended on 31 december 2010 , with no solution being found , and at the time of writing , the puzzle is claimed to remain unsolved .",
    "the aim of this paper is to prove the following result regarding uniqueness of the solution of a random jigsaw or edge - matching puzzle .",
    "[ thm : main ] as @xmath22 the following holds with high probability for a random jigsaw puzzle with @xmath1 types of jigs or random edge - matching puzzle with @xmath1 colors .    1 .   for @xmath2",
    ", there are at least two non - similar solutions .",
    "2 .   for @xmath23 , for any fixed @xmath14 ,",
    "all solutions are similar .",
    "3 .   for @xmath4 ,",
    "the solution is unique up to global rotation .",
    "we remark that a weaker form of @xmath24 was first proved in a earlier version of this paper @xcite .",
    "this will be shown again in this paper , but using a significantly simpler argument .",
    "the question remains what happens in the interval @xmath25 . to get a qualitative understanding for this range",
    ", we can compare our random model to a collection of @xmath26 independently colored / carved pieces where each color / jig type is chosen uniformly at random , that is , without a planted solution .",
    "there are @xmath27 ways to place and orient the pieces into an @xmath0 grid , and the probability that the pieces fit together in a given configuration is @xmath28 .",
    "hence the expected number of solutions of such a puzzle is @xmath29 we see that there is a transition at @xmath30 where the expected number of solutions goes from being very large to very small .    connecting this back to our model ,",
    "the fact that we force the puzzle have at least one solution may increase the probability that other ways to assemble the pieces are also solutions . on the other hand , based on the proofs in this article ,",
    "my intuition is that typical solutions are either similar to the planted assembly , or have very little similarity to it , and hence this effect should be small . because of this , i conjecture that the event that all solutions to a random jigsaw or edge - matching puzzle are similar has a sharp threshold at @xmath31 . moreover , considering how strongly the estimates for @xmath32 in section [ sec : twooversqrte ] depend on @xmath1 , i believe that this threshold is very sharp",
    ". it might even jump directly from @xmath33 to @xmath34 when increasing the number of colors / jig types by @xmath5 .",
    "using a similar heuristic , we can explain the discrepancy between the bounds in parts @xmath24 and @xmath35 of theorem [ thm : main ] ( the factor @xmath36 ) . in the proof of @xmath24 we consider the entire assembled puzzle ,",
    "so , heuristically , random solutions should stop affecting the calculations at @xmath30 . on the other hand , the proof of @xmath35",
    "is based on considering local solutions to the puzzle .",
    "the expected number of ways to build , say , a @xmath37 square of matching pieces out of @xmath26 independently chosen pieces for @xmath38 is roughly @xmath39 . hence , in this case , solutions unrelated to the planted assembly should stop affecting the calculations only at @xmath40 .",
    "thus , it appears that new ideas are needed to close this gap in the main result .",
    "the remainder of the paper will be structured as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : twooversqrte ] we give a proof of part @xmath24 of theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "section [ sec : dupes ] briefly investigates the probability of duplicates and rotationally symmetric pieces , which shows that @xmath41 .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : allsimilar ] we prove part @xmath35 . these sections will be formulated in terms of the random jigsaw puzzle model , but as we already noted , the random edge - matching puzzle can be considered as a special case of this .",
    "let us refer to the unordered collection of jigsaw pieces of a puzzle as the _ box _ of the puzzle .",
    "that is , the box contains the information of how many pieces of each combination of jig types there are in the puzzle , but no information beyond that about their locations or orientations in the planted assembly .",
    "the key observation of this proof is that any carving that results in a puzzle with uea is uniquely determined , up to global rotation , by the box of the puzzle .",
    "hence , there are at most @xmath42 times more such carvings than there are possible boxes .",
    "to make use of this observation , we need the following estimates .",
    "first , the probability that the planted assembly is given any specific carving is @xmath43 .",
    "second , there are @xmath44 ways to choose the jigs of a jigsaw piece : @xmath1 of which being invariant under a @xmath45 rotation , @xmath46 being invariant under a @xmath47 but not a @xmath45 rotation , and the remaining @xmath48 having no rotational symmetry .",
    "hence there are @xmath49 possible types of jigsaw pieces . from this",
    "it follows that the total number of boxes ( including those without solutions ) is @xmath50 .",
    "now , letting @xmath51 denote the number carvings that result in a puzzle with uea , we have @xmath52 where we used stirling s formula in the last step .",
    "one can observe that @xmath53 is convex in @xmath1 , equals @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 for @xmath30 .",
    "hence , for any @xmath2 , @xmath57 which tends to @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "to understand the behavior of the probability that a random jigsaw puzzle has a unique solution , up to global rotation , it is natural to consider uniqueness of the solution as the intersection of two events : the event that all solutions of the puzzle are similar , and the event that the puzzle does not contain duplicate or rotationally symmetric pieces .",
    "the former is characterized by parts @xmath24 and @xmath35 of theorem [ thm : main ] , and , as stated in the introduction , i conjecture that it has a very sharp threshold at @xmath61 .",
    "it remains to consider the latter event .",
    "[ prop : dupes ] the probability that a random jigsaw puzzle contains either duplicate or rotationally symmetric pieces is @xmath33 for @xmath4 .",
    "let @xmath62 denote the number of pairs of duplicate jigsaw pieces , and @xmath63 the number of rotationally symmetric pieces respectively .",
    "the probability that two given jigsaw pieces have identical jig types is @xmath64 if the pieces are non - adjacent in the planted assembly , and @xmath65 if they are adjacent .",
    "hence , @xmath66 similarly , the probability that a jigsaw piece has rotational symmetry is @xmath67 , which implies that @xmath68    by markov s inequality it follows that @xmath69 which tends to @xmath58 for @xmath4 .    by part @xmath35 of theorem [ thm : main ] , all solutions of a random jigsaw puzzle are similar with high probability when @xmath4 .",
    "part @xmath60 of theorem [ thm : main ] follows by combining this with proposition [ prop : dupes ] .    considering the estimates for @xmath70 and @xmath71 further",
    ", one would expect the probability of @xmath72 to be bounded away from @xmath58 and @xmath5 for @xmath73 .",
    "in particular , this would mean that the probability that a random jigsaw puzzle has a unique solution , up to global rotation , is bounded away from @xmath58 and @xmath5 when @xmath74 .",
    "for the sake of brevity , we will not attempt to prove this here .",
    "we can however note that a partial result to this effect was shown in section 3 of @xcite , namely that @xmath75 which implies that the probability of a unique solution is bounded away from @xmath5 for @xmath76 .",
    "in particular , the bound @xmath4 in part @xmath60 of theorem [ thm : main ] is sharp .",
    "to simplify our argument below , let us consider a problem related to unique edge assembly  reconstruction . given a box of shuffled pieces from a random jigsaw puzzle",
    ", we try to guess the planted assembly , up to similarity .",
    "clearly , when all solutions are similar , any solution is valid .",
    "hence it is possible to reconstruct the planted assembly correctly with probability at least @xmath32 . on the other hand ,",
    "if we condition on the event that we are given a certain box with at least two non - similar solutions and a corresponding guess , then there are at most four carvings of the planted assembly for which the guess will be valid , and at least one for which it will be invalid . as all carvings are equally likely , the guess is invalid with probability at least @xmath77",
    ". hence any reconstruction tactic will fail with probability at least @xmath78 .",
    "our proof strategy can be summarized as follows : throughout this section we will assume that @xmath3 for some fixed @xmath14 .",
    "we introduce the notion of a feasible assembly being _ @xmath79-good_. here it is important that one can determine @xmath79-goodness without knowledge of the planted assembly .",
    "we prove that for @xmath80 , the planted assembly is @xmath79-good with high probability , and any @xmath79-good feasible assembly must be similar to the planted one .",
    "this gives us a simple reconstruction strategy that succeeds with high probability  guess any @xmath79-good planted assembly , if such exist . by the above reasoning",
    ", this implies unique edge assembly with high probability , as desired .",
    "let us start by defining some concepts .",
    "we will consider a jigsaw piece to be a vertex with four cyclically ordered _ half - edges _ , representing the sides of the piece .",
    "complete assembly _ of an @xmath0 puzzle is a positioning and orientation of the jigsaw pieces into an @xmath0 grid , regardless of whether the pieces fit together in this configuration .",
    "we will formally consider this as a bijective map from @xmath81 to itself together with a map from @xmath82 , interpreted as the position of and orientation of each piece relative to the planted assembly .",
    "similarly , a _ partial assembly _ is a positioning and orientation of a subset of pieces in the jigsaw puzzle into a square grid .",
    "one important example of a partial assembly is a _",
    "@xmath37 window _ obtained by picking an appropriate square from a complete assembly . for a given ( complete or partial ) assembly , we say that two half - edges are _ connected _ if they correspond to sides of two different jigsaw pieces that are aligned next to each other in the assembly .",
    "note that any assembly can be considered as a graph by joining connected half - edges into edges .",
    "we say that an assembly is _ feasible _ if all connected pairs of half - edges have complementary jig types , that is , everything fits together in the assembly .    for any assembly , we have a natural notion of a dual graph . considering the assembly geometrically in the plane ,",
    "the vertices in this graph are the common corners of at least two jigsaw pieces , and the edges are the common sides of two pieces . hence the edges of the dual graph correspond to the connected pairs of half - edges in the assembly .",
    "see figure [ fig : dualgraph ] .",
    "the _ contour graph _ is the induced subgraph of the dual graph consisting of all edges whose corresponding pairs of half - edges are not connected in the planted assembly , see figure [ fig : contour ] .",
    "we will refer to the connected components of the contour graph as _",
    "contours_. note that the contour graph , together with the boundary of the assembly , partitions the pieces in the assembly into _ connected regions _ given by the sets of pieces contained in each face .",
    "an important observation is that , within each of these regions , the positions and orientations of pieces differ from the planted assembly by a common translation and rotation , and edges of the dual graph lies in the contour graph if and only if its half - edges come from different regions .    given a feasible partial assembly , we say that an edge in its dual graph has _",
    "type @xmath83 _ its corresponding half - edges have jig shape @xmath9 and @xmath10 respectively .",
    "let @xmath84 be the set of between @xmath85 and @xmath1 possible types of edges in the dual graph .",
    "for a feasible assembly , and a set @xmath86 of edges in its dual graph , the _ shape multiplicity of @xmath86 _ is defined as @xmath87 similarly , the shape multiplicity of a feasible partial assembly is the shape multiplicity of the set of all edges in its dual graph .",
    "note that shape multiplicity can be interpreted as the maximal number of disjoint pairs of edges of the same type in @xmath86 .",
    "we say that a feasible complete assembly is _",
    "@xmath79-good _ if the shape multiplicity of any @xmath37 window is at most @xmath5 when the window touches the boundary of the puzzle , and at most @xmath18 otherwise .",
    "in order for a @xmath37 window of the planted assembly to have shape multiplicity at least @xmath89 , there must exist @xmath89 disjoint pairs of edges in the dual graph where each pair has a common type . by the union bound ,",
    "the probability that this occurs in a carving of a @xmath37 window is @xmath90 . summing this over @xmath91 windows with @xmath92 and @xmath93 ones with @xmath94 yields @xmath95 .    for a given partial assembly",
    ", we would like to estimate the probability that it is feasible .",
    "one natural guess would be @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of edges in the contour graph .",
    "however , this is not generally true as events of the form pairs of half - edges fit together may not be independent .",
    "in fact , in the case of an edge - matching puzzle , that is , @xmath98 , one can show that such events are always increasing . in order to proceed",
    ", we make use of two observations .",
    "first , in order for there to be dependency , some connected regions must be adjacent in the planted assembly .",
    "we can formally describe this as that there are half - edges @xmath99 in the contour graph , not necessarily connected in the new assembly ( in fact , they can not be connected there ) , such that @xmath100 and @xmath101 are connected in the planted assembly .",
    "second , in the cases where there is dependency , some edges on the contour will get the same type .",
    "[ lemma : cfi ] fix a partial assembly , and let @xmath97 denote the number of edges in its contour graph @xmath102 . if no two half - edges contained in @xmath102 are connected in the planted assembly , then @xmath103 moreover , without this restriction we have that for any @xmath104 , @xmath105    we construct the abstract graph @xmath106 whose vertices are the half - edges contained in @xmath102 .",
    "we connect a pair of vertices by an _",
    "old edge _ if they are connected in the planted assembly , and by a _ new edge _ if they are connected in the partial assembly in the statement of the lemma .",
    "we will refer to such pairs of vertices in @xmath106 as _ old pairs _ and _ new pairs _ respectively .",
    "note that each vertex in @xmath106 is the end - point of exactly one new edge and at most one old edge , so @xmath106 consists of paths and cycles .",
    "further , these components alternate between old and new edges , and , in the case of a path , begin and end with new edges .",
    "the way the carving of the planted assembly is chosen means that each vertex in @xmath106 that is not part of an old pair is independently and uniformly assigned a jig type , and each old pair is independently and uniformly assigned a pair of complementary jig types .",
    "further , the new assembly is feasible if the jigs of half - edges in each component alternate between two complementary types .",
    "we say that the component is _ feasible _ if this holds .    in the case where no two half - edges contained in the contour graph are connected in the planted assembly , there are no old edges in @xmath106 .",
    "hence each of the @xmath97 new pairs fits together independently with probability @xmath107 .    considering the latter case , a path in @xmath106 with @xmath108 new edges",
    ", @xmath109 is feasible if @xmath110 all have the complementary jig type to @xmath100 , which occurs with probability @xmath111 .",
    "similarly , a cycle in @xmath106 with @xmath108 new edges , @xmath112 is feasible if @xmath110 all have the same jig type , which occurs with probability @xmath113 .",
    "as the total number of new edges is @xmath97 , we see that the probability that the new assembly is feasible is @xmath96 when @xmath106 only consists of paths , and increases by a factor of @xmath1 for each cycle .",
    "note that , by the definition of contour graph , a pair of vertices in @xmath106 can not be connected by both an old and a new edge .",
    "hence , each cycle contains at least two new edges . as a consequence , for each feasible cycle in @xmath106",
    "there are two edges of the same type in @xmath102 .",
    "hence , if the partial assembly is feasible , @xmath114 is at least the number of cycles in @xmath106 .",
    "in particular , there are either more than @xmath115 cycles , in which case the probability of the event in the statement is @xmath58 , or there are at most @xmath115 cycles , in which case the probability is at most @xmath116 , as desired .      [",
    "lemma : euler ] up to translation , the number of connected subgraphs @xmath117 with @xmath97 edges and @xmath118 bounded faces is at most @xmath119 .",
    "moreover , for any @xmath120 , there exists a @xmath121 such that @xmath122    for any such @xmath106 , let @xmath123 denote its number of vertices .",
    "then , by the euler characteristic formula , we have @xmath124 note in particular that this means that @xmath123 is independent of the choice of @xmath106 .",
    "it further follows that @xmath125    now , consider the following procedure for constructing @xmath106",
    ". since we are only interested in the number of graphs up to translation , we may , without loss of generality , assume that the origin is a vertex in @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath126 be the empty graph , and let @xmath127 be the graph only containing the origin .",
    "for each @xmath128 , we construct @xmath129 by selecting a subset of the edges between @xmath130 and @xmath131 , and adding them to @xmath132 .",
    "if @xmath133 , then we terminate and put @xmath134 .    in order for the procedure to construct a graph with @xmath97 edges dividing the plane into @xmath118 regions , it must choose to include an edge @xmath97 times , and choose not to do so @xmath135 times .",
    "hence we can encode any such graph as a binary string of @xmath97 ones and @xmath135 zeroes , which can be done in @xmath136 ways .",
    "finally , considering the double sum @xmath137 which converges absolutely for @xmath138 , it follows that for any @xmath139 and any @xmath140 such that @xmath141 we have @xmath142 letting @xmath143 , @xmath144 , @xmath145 and choosing @xmath146 sufficiently large so that @xmath147 , we get @xmath148    now , suppose we pick an arbitrary @xmath79-good feasible complete assembly . if this assembly contains a contour with exactly four edges which surround a single jigsaw piece , then the eight pieces around it form the neighbourhood of an identical piece in the planted assembly . hence by possibly moving around identical pieces , that is , exchanging the assembly for a similar one , we may assume that no such contours exist in the assembly .",
    "we will now prove that if there is such an assembly with a non - empty contour graph , then this would imply the existence of certain feasible partial assemblies , which with high probability do not exist .",

    "note that @xmath102 can be contained in a @xmath37 window , hence @xmath150 . by taking the subset of jigsaw pieces that have at least one corner on @xmath102",
    ", we obtain a feasible partial assembly with contour graph @xmath102 , @xmath151 connected regions , and satisfying @xmath150 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure [ fig : case1 ] .",

    ", the expected number of corresponding partial assemblies is at most @xmath176    using lemma [ lemma : euler ] to count the number of possibilities for @xmath174 , the probability that there exists a feasible partial assembly as above is at most @xmath177 where , again , @xmath97 and @xmath118 runs over all possible combinations of numbers of edges and faces .",
    "enumerate the bounded faces of @xmath174 from @xmath5 to @xmath118 and let @xmath179 denote the perimeter of the @xmath115:th face . then , as every edge in @xmath102 is counted in the perimeter of two faces , and every edge in @xmath173 in one face , we get @xmath180    the perimeter of each face can be bounded in terms of its area .",
    "suppose face @xmath115 has area @xmath181 , and that it contains jigsaw pieces from @xmath182 columns and @xmath183 rows .",
    "then , on the one hand @xmath184 , and on the other hand the face contains two horizontal and vertical edges for each of these columns and rows .",
    "hence @xmath185    for @xmath186 we can improve this lower bound using the fact that the midpoint of the square is a vertex in @xmath102 .",
    "let us consider @xmath187 such that the midpoint is @xmath188 , that is , the square is the area @xmath189 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath190 be a minimal length path from @xmath188 to the boundary of @xmath191 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "we may , without loss of generality , assume that @xmath190 hits the boundary on the line @xmath192 .",
    "note that this means that the @xmath193-coordinate of any vertex along @xmath190 lies between @xmath194 and @xmath195 .",
    "then , in each column @xmath196\\times { \\ensuremath{\\mathbbm{r}}}$ ] for @xmath197 there is either at least @xmath42 horizontal edges on the boundary of the face , or at most @xmath198 area units inside the face .",
    "letting @xmath199 be the number of columns satisfying the former , and @xmath193 the number that satisfies the latter , we get @xmath200 @xmath201 @xmath202 hence , @xmath203    let @xmath204 .",
    "this function is continuous , and concave on the intervals @xmath205 $ ] and @xmath206 $ ] .",
    "then , by and for a given @xmath118 , the value of @xmath207 is bounded from below by the minimal value of @xmath208 subject to @xmath209 and @xmath210 for @xmath211 .    if @xmath212 , we have @xmath213 and hence the minimization problem is concave . in this case",
    "the function attains its minimum at an extreme point on the boundary of the domain .",
    "up to permutation of variables , there is only one such point , namely @xmath214 and @xmath215 , yielding a minimum of @xmath216 .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath217 , we can divide the problem into two concave minimization problems by considering the case where all @xmath218:s are less than @xmath219 and the case where at least one variable , say @xmath220 , is at least @xmath219 .",
    "again , up to permutation of variables , the only extremal points are @xmath221 @xmath222 with the corresponding values @xmath223 and @xmath224 hence , the minimum in this case is @xmath225 .        using lemma [ lemma : nobigbox ] , we can bound by @xmath231 as @xmath232 , @xmath233 as @xmath59 .",
    "hence the sum is at most @xmath234 as @xmath59 .",
    "+   + * case 3 : * all vertices in the contour graph have distance @xmath235 from the boundary .",
    "+ if this occurs , there is a large connected region in the assembly that contains the @xmath236 square of all jigsaw pieces at distance at least @xmath79 from the boundary .",
    "consider the area in the planted assembly that corresponds to this square . in order to fit in the planted assembly",
    ", this area must cover all jigsaw pieces that are not in the @xmath237 outermost layers . as a consequence of this ,",
    "any jigsaw piece in the @xmath79 outermost layers of the new assembly must come from the @xmath237 outermost layers of the planted assembly .",
    "suppose we take a @xmath238 window in the assembly with a non - trivial contour graph @xmath102 .",
    "let again @xmath173 be the boundary of the window , @xmath97 the number of edges of @xmath102 , and @xmath118 the number of bounded faces of @xmath174 . as this window is at distance @xmath239 from the boundary",
    ", it is part of a @xmath37 window that touches the boundary .",
    "hence , by the definition of @xmath79-good , @xmath240 .",
    "furthermore , by the above reasoning , all connected regions come from the @xmath237 outermost layers of the planted assembly .",
    "as before we apply markov s inequality to the number of such partial assemblies that can be constructed from the random jigsaw puzzle .",
    "there are at most @xmath241 ways to choose the orientation and position of each connected region in the planted assembly , hence , by lemma [ lemma : cfi ] , the expected number of such assemblies corresponding to a fixed @xmath102 is at most @xmath242 we note that if @xmath243 , this is bounded by @xmath244 as @xmath59 . hence , with high probability , only @xmath238 windows where @xmath245 are possible .",
    "let us consider which non - trivial contour graphs @xmath102 satisfy @xmath245 .",
    "it is clear that the only possible way for @xmath174 not to be connected is if @xmath102 consists of four edges surrounding the center jigsaw piece , which we already assumed does not occur in our @xmath79-good feasible complete assembly ( also , @xmath246 in this case ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath174 is connected , its euler characteristic implies that @xmath247 where @xmath123 denotes the number of vertices of @xmath174 .",
    "note that there are always @xmath248 vertices on the boundary of @xmath174 , and , unless @xmath102 is empty , it must contain at least one additional vertex .",
    "hence , the only possibility is that @xmath102 contains exactly one interior vertex .",
    "it follows that @xmath102 consists of two edges that separate a corner piece from the rest of the @xmath238 window .",
    "suppose we have a @xmath79-good feasible complete assembly where the contour graph of each @xmath238 window is either empty , or consists of two edges that cut out a corner piece .",
    "observe that , in the latter case , if we can shift the window one step either vertically or horizontally towards the surrounded corner piece , then we would obtain a window with some other non - trivial contour graph .",
    "hence , whenever a @xmath238 window has a non - trivial contour graph , we can not make this shift .",
    "but the only reason why it would not be possible is if the surrounded corner is , in fact , a corner piece of the complete assembly .    in conclusion , for any such @xmath79-good feasible complete assembly ,",
    "all jigsaw pieces except possibly the four corners have the correct relative positions .",
    "but , with high probability , the 16 sides of the corner pieces all have different jig shapes , and thus only fit together with the rest of the puzzle as in the planted assembly , as desired .",
