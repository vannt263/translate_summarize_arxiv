    "motivated in part by the hierarchy problem , a number of theoretical models have been developed recently which raise the possibility that the energy scale at which gravity is unified with the other fundamental forces could be as low as @xmath0 tev @xcite . in these models , large extra spatial dimensions ( which for compact dimensions could be as large as @xmath0 mm ) arise which might be accessible experimentally @xcite . while the effects of these new dimensions are generally model dependent , constraints on extra dimensional physics which are relatively independent of theory can be obtained from experiments searching for deviations from newton s law of gravity at sub - millimeter distances .",
    "such experiments can be classified according to the dominant background force acting between the test bodies used . for separations",
    "@xmath3 m gravity produces the dominant background and a number of groups are conducting experiments testing newtonian gravity at @xmath4 mm scales . for smaller separations ,",
    "casimir forces provide the dominant background force , and the experiments setting the best limits in this regime are those testing the casimir force law . in this paper , we will briefly review the theoretical motivation and phenomenology used in sub - millimeter force experiments .",
    "we then present new limits extracted from a recent experiment by the riverside group @xcite , which uses an atomic force microscope to test the casimir force . after comparing these results with existing limits ,",
    "we conclude by describing future possibilities for using afm experiments to set limits on new forces and extra dimensional physics .",
    "since gravity is a theory of spacetime , it is inevitable that the effects of extra dimensions will modify newton s law of gravity which is only valid in a 4-dimensional spacetime .",
    "although newtonian gravity has been well - tested over long distance scales , our understanding of gravity at sub - millimeter scales is quite limited @xcite .",
    "phenomenologically , the deviations from newton s law arise naturally in two different ways @xcite . in models with large compact dimensions such as originally proposed by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali ( add ) @xcite",
    ", one finds that the potential energy between two point particles with masses @xmath5 and @xmath6 separated by a distance @xmath7 ( the characteristic size of the compact dimensions ) is given by the usual newtonian gravitational potential energy with a yukawa correction @xcite : @xmath8 where the dimensionless constant @xmath9 depends on the nature of the extra dimensions , and where @xmath10 .",
    "for example , for a toroidal compactification with all @xmath11 extra dimensions having equal size , @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "when the separation between the masses decreases to the point where @xmath13 , the usual inverse square law of gravity changes to a new power - law : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the fundamental gravitational constant in the full @xmath16 dimensional spacetime .",
    "the size @xmath17 of the extra dimensions , according to the add models , is then related to the energy scale @xmath18 at which the unification occurs by @xmath19 where the planck mass is @xmath20 gev , and we have assumed @xmath21  tev  @xcite . for @xmath22 , @xmath23 cm is obviously excluded by solar system tests of newtonian gravity @xcite . if @xmath24 , @xmath25 mm , which is the scale currently being probed by a number of sub - millimeter gravity experiments @xcite . for @xmath1 , eq .",
    "( [ r * ] ) gives @xmath26 nm which is roughly the range accessible to experiments using atomic force microscopy like those discussed below .",
    "it is important to recognize , however , that while @xmath21 tev is a natural scale , it is little more than a reasoned guess .",
    "therefore , the scales suggested by eq .  ( [ r * ] ) should be taken simply as a heuristic guide for designing experiments .",
    "it should also be noted that the yukawa correction given in eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) arises naturally in ways unrelated to extra dimensional physics .",
    "for example , yukawa potentials arise from new forces generated by the exchange of bosons of mass @xmath27 ( e.g. , scalar , graviphoton , dilaton ) @xcite .",
    "a second class of extra dimensional models , such as that originally proposed by randall and sundrum @xcite , allow the extra dimensions to be non - compact , but warped . in these models , the leading order correction to the newtonian potential energy between two point masses takes on a power - law form @xcite : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the warping scale .",
    "the introduction of a new length scale @xmath30 such as @xmath29 or @xmath17 into a theory allows one to generalize eq .",
    "( [ rs power - law ] ) to arbitrary powers @xmath31 : @xmath32 , \\label{general power - law}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is a dimensionless constant .",
    "power - law corrections to newtonian gravity also arise from new interactions involving the exchange of 2 massless quanta .",
    "for example , @xmath34 may arise from the simultaneous exchange of two photons or two massless scalars @xcite , and @xmath35 characterizes the exchange of two massless pseudoscalars @xcite .",
    "potentials with @xmath36 arise from massless axion exchange @xcite , and also from the exchange of a ( massless ) neutrino - antineutrino ( @xmath37 ) pair @xcite .",
    "all of the extra dimensional models discussed above are speculative at this stage , and much work remains to be done to test their consistency and viability .",
    "however , they are important in demonstrating that if extra spatial dimensions exist , new fundamental energy scales must also exist , and that these scales will modify newtonian gravity at some level .",
    "furthermore , from the models that have been developed we see that these modifications generally take the form of yukawa or power - law potentials .",
    "therefore , while there remain many unanswered questions regarding models of extra - dimensional physics , the phenomenology supporting short distance gravity experiments rests upon a much firmer footing .    as noted earlier",
    ", experiments testing newtonian gravity over separations @xmath38 m have set significant limits on the yukawa coupling @xmath9 for ranges @xmath39 m @xcite . in addition",
    ", precise gravity experiments have set the best limits on power - law interactions for @xmath40 ( see table [ power - law limit table ] ) .",
    "motivated in part by the new extra dimensional models discussed above , several experimental groups @xcite are now probing newtonian gravity at sub - millimeter scales and have begun to set significant constraints on new physics at ranges @xmath4 mm .",
    "it is expected that within the next few years such experiments will extend our understanding of gravity down to separations where casimir forces form the significant background .",
    "coincidentally , the past few years have also witnessed the first precise tests of the casimir force @xcite .",
    "lamoreaux @xcite used a torsion balance to measure the casimir force between a disk and spherical lens , while ederth @xcite measured the force between two crossed cylinders .",
    "the practical implications of the casimir force have been considered recently with a mems ( microelectromechanical ) device by chan , _ et al .",
    "_ at bell labs @xcite .",
    "finally , a series of force measurements specifically devised to test various aspects of the casimir force has been conducted by the riverside group using an atomic force microscope @xcite . this entire experimental effort has motivated theorists to more carefully examine the effects of surface roughness , temperature , and finite conductivity which produce significant deviations from the idealized case of the casimir force between two perfectly conducting , smooth bodies @xcite .",
    "the inclusion of these corrections has been shown to be crucial in obtaining agreement between theory and experiment @xcite .",
    "while the goal of all these experiments is to improve our understanding of the origin and behavior of casimir forces , they have also been used to set limits on new interactions @xcite .",
    "these limits are in addition to those obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite from earlier , much less precise casimir and van der waals force measurements @xcite . it can be shown that casimir force measurements are relatively ineffective compared to longer ranged gravity experiments in setting limits on power - law interactions of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ general power - law ] ) .",
    "the reason is that for @xmath40 , such power - law forces between macroscopic bodies are relatively insensitive to the separation of the bodies when these are placed in close proximity @xcite .",
    "thus , there is no advantage to performing very short distance experiments , which are in any case generally less precise than larger scale gravity experiments , to search for power - law corrections to newtonian gravity .    on the other hand , experiments searching for yukawa interactions of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) are only sensitive when the separation @xmath41 of the test bodies is of order @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "hence , to constrain the yukawa coupling @xmath9 for a given value of @xmath42 , one must devise experiments such that @xmath41 is of order @xmath42 .",
    "therefore , if one wishes to constrain extra dimensions of size @xmath43  m using force measurements , one must inevitably confront large casimir forces which grow rapidly for @xmath44  m @xcite .",
    "this is why casimir force experiments yield the best constraints on @xmath9 for these separations .",
    "we turn next to the focus of this paper , which is the recent measurement of the casimir force performed by the riverside group @xcite who used an atomic force microscope .",
    "( we will henceforth refer to the work of the riverside group as `` mohideen , _ et al .",
    "_ '' ) like the previous afm measurements carried out by this group @xcite , this experiment measured the force between a metallized polystyrene sphere mounted on an afm tip and a substrate composed of a flat sapphire disk . however , this experiment differed from the previous efforts in several important respects : ( 1 ) the sphere and disk were each coated with a layer of gold of thickness @xmath45 nm .",
    "previously , aluminum coatings had been used instead , but this also required an additional surface layer of au / pd on top of the al to prevent oxidation .",
    "the use of only a single gold layer in the new experiment significantly simplifies the calculations of the forces involved , since one can treat the gold layer as infinitely thick as far as the casimir force is concerned . also , because au is much more dense than the previously used layers , stronger limits on new forces can be obtained .",
    "( 2 ) the gold layers were significantly smoother than previous coatings .",
    "the root - mean - square amplitude of the gold surfaces was measured to be only @xmath46 nm which means that corrections arising from the surface roughness could be neglected in all force calculations .",
    "( 3 ) electrostatic forces which plague nearly all short distance force measurements were reduced to @xmath47% of the casimir force at the shortest separation .",
    "this meant that no subtractions were required to separate casimir forces from spurious electrostatic background forces .",
    "the electrostatic force was used to arrive at an independent measurement of the surface separation including separation on contact of the two surfaces .",
    "( 4 ) the measurements were performed over smaller separations @xmath48 , @xmath49  nm which means this experiment can search for yukawa forces with smaller ranges @xmath42 . however , the absolute error of the force measurements was somewhat larger than in the previous experiments , @xmath50n .",
    "this is due to the thinner gold coating used in @xcite which led to poor thermal conductivity of the cantilever . at the smallest measured separations ,",
    "this error was still less than 1% of the measured casimir force .",
    "thus , this experiment can be used to significantly tighten constraints on new yukawa interactions as we will now show .",
    "we begin by calculating the force arising between the afm tip and the substrate using eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) .",
    "first , it is easy to show that the newtonian contribution is negligible .",
    "since the diameter of the sphere ( including the gold layer ) was @xmath51 @xmath52 m , while the disk diameter was @xmath53 cm , it follows that @xmath54 which allows us to consider each atom of the sphere as if it were placed directly above the center of the disk . in this case , the vertical component of the newtonian gravitational force acting between the disk and a sphere atom of mass @xmath55 located at a distance @xmath56 above the disk is @xmath57 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\approx &   -2\\pi gm_1\\rho_{\\rm disk } d\\left [ 1-\\frac{d+2l}{2l}\\right ] , \\label{11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is the disk density , @xmath59 mm is the thickness of the disk , and only the first order terms in @xmath60 and @xmath61 have been retained .",
    "the newtonian gravitational force acting between the disk and the sphere is obtained from eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) by integration over the sphere @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the density of the sphere .",
    "even if the sphere and disk were composed of solid vacuo - distilled gold with @xmath64kg / m@xmath65 , one finds from eq .",
    "( [ 12 ] ) that @xmath66 , so the usual newtonian gravitational force can be neglected .",
    "the force arising from the yukawa correction to newtonian gravity given by the second term of eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) should be calculated taking into account the actual compositions of the test bodies . for a polystyrene sphere @xmath67kg / m@xmath65 , for a sapphire disk @xmath68kg / m@xmath65 , and for the vacuo - distilled gold covering layers @xmath69kg / m@xmath65 .",
    "the yukawa force @xmath70 arising from eq .",
    "( [ yukawa ] ) can be easily obtained using the same procedure used to calculate the newtonian gravitational force .",
    "the result is @xmath71\\ , \\left[\\rho_{\\rm au}-(\\rho_{\\rm au}-\\rho_{\\rm sphere})e^{-\\delta/\\lambda } \\right ] , \\label{13}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the sphere - disk separation distance , and @xmath45 nm is the thickness of the gold coatings .",
    "the most stringent limits on new forces are obtained for the smallest possible separation . according to ref .",
    "@xcite , the rms deviation of the measured force ( @xmath72 ) from the theoretical value ( @xmath73 ) of the sum of all the known forces ( casimir and electrostatic ) is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the total number of force measurements .",
    "this is slightly larger than 3.5 pn , the experimental uncertainty of the force measurement at @xmath76 nm .",
    "therefore , to set constraints on the yukawa coupling constant @xmath9 , we will assume @xmath77 3.8 pn .",
    "the resulting limit is represented by the bold curve labeled `` mohideen 2000 '' in fig .",
    "[ limit figure ] .    before comparing the constraint obtained here with limits obtained from other experiments ,",
    "let us first discuss various sources of error which could affect our result .",
    "first , the uncertainty in the separation @xmath48 arising from the surface roughness is approximately @xmath78 nm which gives @xmath79 .",
    "this will produce a significant effect when @xmath80  nm , but as we will see below , other experiments produce better limits in this range . for @xmath81 , where the most stringent limits are obtained ,",
    "the resulting errors are only @xmath82 which can be neglected .",
    "second , it is important that all known forces be included in @xmath73 in using eq .",
    "( [ f rms ] ) . in short distance force experiments ,",
    "electrostatic effects can be significant .",
    "however , in the mohideen experiment , the measured residual potential difference of 3 mv between the gold sphere and disk leads to a force only 0.1% of the casimir force at @xmath76 nm .",
    "although this effect is small , it was included in @xmath73 .",
    "finally , the most significant difficulties arising in extracting limits from casimir force experiments involve calculating the casimir force between the interacting bodies .",
    "due to practical difficulties , none of the most recent tests of the casimir force use parallel plates for the interacting bodies , for which accurate calculations can be made .",
    "( the experiment by carugno @xcite uses parallel plates , but has not yet reached sufficient sensitivity to detect the casimir force . )",
    "rather , curved surfaces are used which requires the use of the proximity force theorem ( pft ) to calculate the casimir force @xcite . since the pft produces reasonable results when applied to casimir forces",
    ", it is probably correct .",
    "although there has not been a rigorous proof of the pft in this context @xcite ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for an interesting semi - classical argument ) , we will assume that its use in the analysis of the mohideen experiment is valid .",
    "other difficulties in casimir force calculations arise from the use of tabulated values of the complex dielectric constant as functions of frequency for the materials comprising the test bodies .",
    "it has been pointed out that if different interpolation schemes are applied to these discrete data , the resulting calculated casimir force can differ by as much as 4% @xcite .",
    "in addition , the tabulated dielectric properties were obtained using bulk samples and not the coatings which are actually used in the experiment .",
    "it would then be best to directly measure the dielectric properties of the actual test bodies to accurately determine @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "since this can not be done in the present context , and since there is no obvious discrepancy or inconsistency arising in the mohideen experiment , we will not consider this problem here and leave it to future experiments to address this issue .",
    "as can be seen from fig .  [ limit figure ] , the casimir force measurement between the gold surfaces carried out by mohideen , _ et al .",
    "_ strengthens the previously known constraints obtained from their earlier experiment @xcite using aluminum surfaces ( labeled by `` mohideen 1999 '' ) by as much as a factor of 19 within the range @xmath84 m , with the most significant improvement occurring at @xmath85(510)nm .",
    "these constraints are up to 4500 times more stringent than those obtained from older casimir and van der waals force measurements between dielectrics ( curves labeled by `` casimir '' and `` vdw '' respectively ) . in the same figure ,",
    "the curve labeled by `` lamoreaux '' exhibits the constraint obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the casimir force measurement which used a torsion pendulum @xcite .",
    "the curve denoted by `` ederth '' gives the new constraints obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite from the recent experiment which measured the casimir force between two crossed cylinders @xcite .",
    "we see that curve `` mohideen 2000 , '' which exhibits the limits obtained in this paper , represents the most stringent bound in the interaction range @xmath86 m .",
    "it is evident from fig .",
    "[ limit figure ] that for separations @xmath87 m much work is needed to improve the sensitivity of force experiments to yukawa interactions of the strength predicted by extra dimensional models ( @xmath8810 ) . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the constraints following from the experiment in ref .",
    "@xcite can be improved by up to four orders of magnitude in the range @xmath89  m which is what is required to constrain physically interesting values of @xmath9 .",
    "still , experiments using atomic force microscopy @xcite remain almost fifteen orders of magnitude below the sensitivity needed to reach the value @xmath90110 in the interaction range @xmath91 m .",
    "furthermore , significant ( and sometimes even more stringent ) constraints on the extra dimensional mass scale @xmath92 have been obtained from accelerator experiments @xcite , astrophysics @xcite , and cosmology @xcite .",
    "however , one must remember that gravity and casimir force experiments are also sensitive to other non - extra dimensional effects such as dilaton and moduli exchange which can lead to yukawa forces with @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "therefore , all experiments which can reduce the allowed region in the @xmath9@xmath42 plane are meaningful .",
    "we believe that in the future the best ultrashort range limits will come from a new class of experiments designed specifically to search for new forces rather than to test the casimir force . in such experiments",
    "the casimir effect is an unwanted background that needs to be suppressed .",
    "one suppression technique proposed recently @xcite relies on the observation that the casimir force depends on the _ electronic _ properties of interacting samples , whereas any gravitational interactions ( either conventional or new ) , and virtually all other proposed interactions , involve couplings to nuclei ( as well as to electrons ) .",
    "hence by comparing the interactions of two test masses which have very similar electronic properties , but different nuclei , with a common attracting source mass , we may be able to subtract out the common casimir background .",
    "this would leave a residual nuclear - nuclear interaction between each of the samples and the source , and these should be different for the two samples .",
    "we refer to this technique as the _ iso - electronic effect _ , and it can be implemented in two ways .",
    "one is to choose as the test masses elements such as cu and au whose nuclei are quite different , but which are known to have very similar casimir properties @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the test samples could be chosen to be isotopes of the same element whose nuclei would contain different numbers of neutrons , but whose electronic properties would be extremely similar . in either case , any residual differences in the electronic properties of the test masses would still have to be calculated , but this should in principle present no significant problems @xcite .",
    "a possible design for an afm experiment @xcite which utilizes the iso - electronic effect , is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ design figure ] . in this experiment",
    ", a gold - coated sphere would be attached to an afm tip and oscillated with frequency @xmath94 .",
    "the substrate would be composed of alternating strips of different isotopes of the same element , and would be oscillated horizontally with frequency @xmath95 .",
    "the signal for a new force would then be a force on the tip that depends on @xmath95 which should not be present if surface roughness and electrostatic effects are the same for the strips . since the yukawa force of the afm tip on the substrate couples only to the mass within a range @xmath42 of the surfaces ,",
    "the net sphere - substrate force will be proportional to the difference in the densities of the strips : @xmath96 therefore , it is important to select elements having isotopes with the largest possible mass density differences .",
    "possible candidates include ruthenium , osmium , nickel , and palladium , all of which can have isotope mass density differences exceeding @xmath97 kg / m@xmath98 .",
    "other possible designs for ultrashort distance experiments can be found in refs .",
    "it is clear that experiments which search for new forces in the casimir regime will be faced with significant challenges .",
    "however , there is strong theoretical motivation to conduct such searches , and new techniques ( including , possibly , those suggested here ) will certainly be developed to overcome these obstacles .",
    "the afm is a natural tool to be used in this effort as demonstrated by the experiments of mohideen , _ et al .",
    "furthermore , this instrument can be easily adapted to experiments whose intent is to specifically search for new forces .",
    "such laboratory force experiments have provided , and will continue to provide , important , and relatively model - independent constraints on new physics which complement those obtained from high - energy experiments and astrophysical observations .",
