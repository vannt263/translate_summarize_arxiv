    "in this article , we study last passage time to a specific state and time reversal of linear diffusions , and consider their applications to credit risk management . more specifically ,",
    "we are interested in certain threshold , denoted by @xmath0 , of company s leverage ratio , an exit from which means an entry into danger zone and would lead to insolvency without returning to that point @xmath0 . in other words , we study the lat passage time to @xmath0 before bankruptcy .",
    "it is often the case that companies in financial distress can not recover once the leverage ratio deteriorates to a certain level : the lack of creditworthiness makes it next to impossible to continue usual business relations with their contractors , suppliers , customers , creditors , and investors , which in turn further endangers the company s solvency .",
    "then companies would become bankrupt , not being able to improve the leverage ratio back to @xmath0 . in this sense , this @xmath0 can be considered as a precautionary level , the passage of which triggers an alarm . in this paper",
    "we assume the leverage ratio of the company is a function of a linear diffusion ; thus , @xmath0 is equivalent to a certain threshold @xmath1 for this linear diffusion .",
    "below , we will continue the discussion using @xmath1 .",
    "+ we address three problems .",
    "first , we fix an arbitrary level as @xmath1 , an entrance point to danger zone , and study the distribution of the last passage time to this point .",
    "second , we derive the distribution of the time until insolvency after the last passage time to the fixed dangerous zone entrance point .",
    "finally , we suggest how company managers can choose this level @xmath1 as a solution to an optimization problem .",
    "as will be illustrated below with empirical analysis , the information to be provide by the last passage time to @xmath1 is rich , offering a nice risk management tool .",
    "the leverage process of the company is a transient linear diffusion in our setting . in solving the above three problems",
    ", we first derive the formulas for a _ general transient diffusion _ with certain characteristics",
    "( propositions [ prop:1 ] , [ prop : reversal ] , and [ prop:3 ] ) , and then apply these results to the leverage process of our interest .",
    "specifically , we will be dealing with a transient diffusion process which has an attracting left boundary with killing and the natural right boundary that can be attracting or non - attracting . to our knowledge , this article is the first to present a framework that provides an analytical tool to credit management as applications of time reversal and last passage time of general linear diffusions .",
    "as to our first problem ( discussed in section [ sec : last - passage - time ] ) , last passage times of standard markov processes are studied in @xcite .",
    "they study the joint distribution of the process at the last exit time from a transient set and the last exit time itself using a potential kernel of the additive functional associated with the set .",
    "@xcite study the density of last exit time of transient linear diffusions on positive axis with scale function satisfying @xmath2 and @xmath3 using tanaka s formula .",
    "they apply the result to bessel processes .",
    "last passage time of a firm s value is discussed in @xcite .",
    "they analyze a value of defaultable claims which involve rebate payments at some random time .",
    "the random time when the payment is made is assumed to be last passage time of the value of the firm to a fixed level .",
    "we shall employ some techniques for time reversal of diffusions in @xcite that uses @xmath4-transform methods because the technique is a fast and easy way to obtain an explicit formula , compared to other studies .",
    "we shall provide a comprehensive treatment of various cases in proposition [ prop:1 ] .",
    "see also sharpe @xcite for a specific example of time reversal and a recent account by chung and walsh @xcite .",
    "we can use the last passage time density for a premonition of imminent absorption : _ how dangerous would it be if the process hits that level @xmath1 ? _ specifically , based on the density @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the last time to visit level @xmath1 , we compute @xmath7 , the probability that the premonition occurs within one year . we demonstrate this by using actual company data . + after deriving the transition density of the last passage time to a certain level , we analyze the time left until bankruptcy after the last passage time in section [ sec : mean - time - after - passage ] .",
    "in contrast to previous literature , we study the time after the last passage time to level @xmath1 but not the total time spent in a danger zone .",
    "this is one of the novel features of our paper .",
    "nevertheless , we are citing some articles that analyze the occupation time of the danger zone since this is somehow related to our paper .",
    "@xcite models the surplus of the company using brownian motion with positive drift and uses omega model to analyze occupation time in  red \" .",
    "this model assumes that there is a time interval between surplus of the company becoming negative for the first time and the bankruptcy .",
    "@xcite study the total time brownian motion spends below zero and the relation between this laplace transform of this occupation time and the probability of going bankrupt in finite time .",
    "@xcite model the firm value by time - homogeneous diffusion with level dependent drift and volatility parameters and set @xmath8 as a reorganization barrier , @xmath9 as liquidation barrier , and @xmath10 as the duration of the grace period decided by the court .",
    "they study the probability of the event @xmath11 where @xmath12 denoted the first time the first has stayed below @xmath8 for @xmath10 time period .",
    "other studies concerning total time in red are @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these studies , our focus is not on the occupation time of the danger zone but rather on knowing the distribution of the lifetime left after the last passage time to a certain level .",
    "this is a more complicated task ( involving two random times ) , but it is essential information for risk management .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : endogenizing ] , we will suggest a methodology how the specific level for the last passage time should be chosen as appropriate one .",
    "for this , we present an optimization problem using occupation time distribution and excursion theory , which we believe is new .",
    "( see egami and yamazaki @xcite which is a different optimization problem for this purpose but does not use last passage argument . )",
    "let us consider the probability space @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the set of all possible realizations of the stochastic economy , and @xmath15 is a probability measure defined on @xmath16 .",
    "we denote by @xmath17 the filtration satisfying the usual condition and consider the diffusion process @xmath18 adapted to @xmath19 .",
    "the state space of @xmath18 is @xmath20 and we adjoint an isolated point @xmath21 .",
    "we call @xmath22 a sample path from @xmath23 with coordinates @xmath24",
    ". the lifetime of @xmath18 is defined by @xmath25 .",
    "suppose that a firm has asset with its market value @xmath26 .",
    "we assume the asset process follows geometric brownian motion with parameter @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the debt process @xmath29 grows at the rate of @xmath30 : @xmath31 where we set initial values @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively . by assuming @xmath34",
    ", we define the leverage process @xmath35 as @xmath36 .",
    "then we set the insolvency time of the firm as @xmath37 since @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 implies @xmath42 which means that the insolvency time is the first passage time of brownian motion with drift @xmath43 to state @xmath10 .",
    "consequently , our study about the leverage process @xmath44  can be reduced to the study of the brownian motion with drift on the state space @xmath45 . since the stopping time @xmath46 is predictable , it is possible and may be a good idea to set a threshold level @xmath0 for the leverage process , so that when it passes this point from above , the firm should prepare and start precautionary measures to avoid possible subsequent insolvency .",
    "@xmath47 means @xmath48 and we can again study the passage time to this arbitrary @xmath49 for the brownian motion with drift . while we are interested in this specific problem , we rather discuss and prove our results for a generic diffusion @xmath18 .",
    "we wish to stress that our assertions below hold in a general setting and thus are applicable to other problems .",
    "we are interested in the last passage time of brownian motion with drift @xmath43 to the state @xmath1 : @xmath50 which is @xmath51 if the set in the brace is empty .",
    "the _ scale function _",

    "the left boundary @xmath10 is attracting since @xmath56 .",
    "the right boundary @xmath57 can be attracting ( @xmath3 when @xmath58 ) or non - attracting ( @xmath59 when @xmath60 ) . before finding the distribution of the last passage time ,",
    "let us introduce some objects that are needed .",

    "we have the following proposition .    [ prop:1 ] for any @xmath67 satisfying @xmath68 , the distribution of @xmath6 when the company goes bankrupt in finite time is @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the transition density of the brownian motion with drift @xmath53 to be killed at @xmath10 : @xmath71 with respect to the speed measure @xmath72 . for @xmath73 , the distribution of @xmath6 when the company goes bankrupt in finite time has atom at @xmath51 .",

    "it is much more convenient than handling the joint density of @xmath6 and @xmath245 in the original problem .",

    "the result can easily be extended to general diffusions @xmath18 including browinan cases with @xmath248 .",
    "in fact proposition [ prop:3 ] is proved for general diffusions .    to form an appropriate optimization problem",

    "let us now define @xmath251 then the firm may want to raise the level @xmath1 to accomplish the following task : assuming that at some point of time @xmath252 , the firm finds itself below the level @xmath1 , it wants to minimize the probability that @xmath253 is the last visit to @xmath1 : @xmath254 . while the firm can make this probability smaller by raising the level @xmath1 ,",
