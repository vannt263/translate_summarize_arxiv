    "multiqubit entanglement is identified as a key resource for scalable quantum computation and communication @xcite . as an important multiqubit entangled state ,",
    "an equally weighted superposition of @xmath1 single - spin state , i.e. , the entangled @xmath2 state , has also been applied to the quantum information processing such as the grover search @xcite . in recent years",
    ", the theoretical and experimental constructions of multiqubit entangled states have been demonstrated with very few qubits in nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and trapped ions @xcite . however , this result is far away from the scalable quantum information processing in principle . from this point of view",
    ", significant efforts have been devoted to the study of quantum dynamics of many spins in quantum dots @xcite , semiconductors @xcite and molecular magnets @xcite .",
    "electron spins in these solids are considered among the promising candidates for quantum information technology @xcite . due to the range of neighboring spins in quantum dots and semiconductors ,",
    "the local control over the electrical and magnetic field is very challenging @xcite .",
    "this is becoming one main technological obstacle in the implementation of quantum logic gates . in this perspective , single molecular magnets(smms ) with antiferromagnetic interactions can act as effective qubits @xcite .",
    "compared to quantum dots , the molecular and supramolecular chemistry enable the manipulation of long range interactions between coupled molecular rings @xcite . even for the fast control requirement , the preferable electric control over smms is also possible @xcite .",
    "the proposal of quantum gates @xcite based on two molecular magnets such as @xmath3 has been put forward . in the interesting experiment @xcite",
    ", @xmath4 rings can be linked to each other so conveniently that the effective coupling between them can be chemically tuned by choosing the linker .",
    "therefore , it is very valuable to investigate the multiqubit entanglement in this quantum hardware which consists of a collection of coupled molecular magnets .    in this paper ,",
    "our attentions are focused on the special quantum systems with @xmath1 antiferromagnetic molecular rings which are weakly coupled to a central molecular magnetic . in sec .",
    "ii , for the typical example of @xmath4 , the effective spin hamiltonian of @xmath0 coupled molecular magnets can be obtained in the form of anisotropic heiserberg exchange . in sec .",
    "iii , we analytically give the exact quantum dynamics of the system in the single - spin subspace .",
    "the entangled @xmath2 state is generated in this controllable quantum systems . and",
    "the multiqubit entangled states can also be perfectly transmitted from some rings to others by means of choosing the intermolecular coupling .",
    "a useful discussion concludes the paper .",
    "some molecular magnets @xcite have been synthesized as suitable candidates for carrying the quantum information and qubit encoding . in particular , a class prototypical system of the substituted antiferromagnetic @xmath4 rings can act as an effective two - level quantum system at low temperatures and show the long decoherence time . here , we take into account the quantum systems of @xmath5 rings with the number of @xmath1 which are weakly coupled to a central molecular ring @xmath6 . the hamiltonian of the quantum system can be described as @xmath7 here @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the spin hamiltonians of the @xmath10th circumjacent ring and central one respectively . according to @xcite , the spin hamiltonian of @xmath4 is @xmath11 & \\nonumber\\\\ & + \\sum_{k\\neq l}\\vec{\\tau}_{k}\\cdot \\vec{d}_{k , l}\\cdot \\vec{\\tau}_{l},(x = x_{i},x_{c})&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the spin operator of the @xmath13th electron spin in a molecular ring",
    ", @xmath14 describes the site of @xmath15 substitution @xmath16 and others denote the sites of @xmath17 irons @xmath18 .",
    "the first item of the above equation is the dominant isotropic heisenberg exchange with different couplings @xmath19 , while the second and third ones account for the anisotropic local crystal field and the intramolecular dipolar interaction .",
    "for the experimental measurements , the intramolecular dipolar coupling is small enough to be neglected in the following context . with the idea of the local exchange between the @xmath20th electron spin in the @xmath10th circumjacent ring and the @xmath21th one in the central ring ,",
    "the form of @xmath22 is expressed by @xmath23 here , the symbol of @xmath24 includes all possible pairs of selective local linkers between two rings where @xmath25 denotes one pair . at very low temperatures , all of the anitiferromagnetic molecular rings serve as effective qubits for the ground doublet states @xmath26 with the total spin @xmath27 .",
    "these two degenerate states are separated from the next excited state by a large energy gap @xmath28 . for the weak local exchanges ,",
    "the heisenberg interaction of @xmath22 can be expressed by the effective molecular spin operators @xmath29 @xmath30\\ ] ] where the effective intermolecular interaction can be described by @xmath31 and the anisotropy @xmath32 .",
    "it shows that the interactions closely depend on the definite structures of the molecular rings and local linkers .",
    "the recent experiment has demonstrated that the effective couplings can be chemically tuned by the control of the local linkers between two molecular rings @xcite . without losing the generality ,",
    "the controllable anisotropy is calculated for two coupling rings @xmath33 with the same structure .",
    "it is seen that the anisotropy @xmath34 can be varied with the change of the ratio of the intramolecular couplings @xmath35 and local crystal field @xmath36 in fig .",
    "when the value of @xmath35 is near to one , the values of @xmath34 is increased almost linearly with respect to @xmath37 . by the manipulation of two pairs of local linkers , fig .",
    "1(b ) illustrates that the anisotropy @xmath34 can also be tunable in the large range from the negative value to the positive one .",
    "for the special case of @xmath38 , the model of @xmath22 is simplified to be the heisenberg @xmath39 one .",
    "if the selective local exchanges arrive at a critical ones @xmath40 , the anisotropy can be rapidly tuned from one negative value to a large positive one . because of the symmetric property @xmath41=0 $ ] , the effective spin hamiltonian for @xmath0 interacting molecular rings can be described in the single - spin subspace of @xmath42 @xmath43 & \\nonumber\\\\ h_{eff}|\\psi_{n+1}\\rangle&=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\\frac { \\gamma_i}4[2|\\psi_i\\rangle-(1+\\delta_i)|\\psi_{n+1}\\rangle]&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the basis of the subspace @xmath44 . at very low temperatures , the quantum information could be processed in this subspace .",
    "then , the dynamics of these states can be analytically solved as follows .",
    "our quantum memory registers will be expanded by the set of states in the single - spin subspace for low temperatures @xmath45 .",
    "the general expression of the effective hamiltonian @xmath46 can be obtained    @xmath47    by means of the tunable exchanges @xmath48 for the local selective linkers , the anisotropic interactions can be controlled and satisfy @xmath49 . in this condition , we can analytically obtain the eigenstates and corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "the effective hamiltonian @xmath46 has @xmath50 degenerate states @xmath51 with the same eigenvalue @xmath52 and two nondegerate states @xmath53 with @xmath54 $ ] where @xmath55 .",
    "the set of all orthonormalized eigenstates can be given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "to study how to generate the multiqubit entangled states , we need to find the evolution operator in the single - spin subspace @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 .    for illustration , we choose two kind of typical initial states .",
    "if the initialized state is @xmath61 , the general state at any time @xmath62 is obtained by @xmath63|\\psi_i\\rangle&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 where the phase angles @xmath67 and @xmath68 . at a certain time for @xmath69 ,",
    "the possibility of @xmath70 is zero . for the circumjacent @xmath1 sites",
    ", we need the possibility of each @xmath71 is equal and the ratio of the effective interactions @xmath72 @xmath73 the actual quantum state at this time is @xmath74 ) .",
    "then by means of the single - qubit phase operator at the @xmath10-th ring , we can obtain the perfect @xmath2 state .",
    "when another initial state is chosen as @xmath70 , the general state at time @xmath62 is expressed by @xmath75 through the calculation of the possibilities of the eigenstates , it is found out that the entangled @xmath2 state @xmath76 can be generated when the time satisfies @xmath77 , @xmath38 and @xmath78 .",
    "however , in realistic quantum control , certain fluctuations from internal and external impacts are unavoidable .",
    "to evaluate the effects of quantum fluctuation on the generation of the multiqubit entangled state , we take into account the simplest case of @xmath79 under the circumstance of @xmath80 and @xmath81 . in accordance with the above analysis",
    ", the perfect entangled @xmath2 state can be produced at the time @xmath82 . in regard to the certain fluctuation , the effective intermolecular interactions possibly obey the relation of @xmath83 . from fig .",
    "2 , it is seen that the error of generation @xmath84 is almost linearly decreased with the fluctuation parameter @xmath85 .",
    "the relation of the values @xmath86 can demonstrate that the proficiency of the generation of the multiqubit entangled state is high enough to resist the fluctuation to a certain extant .    in solid state quantum computers ,",
    "it is very necessary to investigate the quantum transport of the multiqubit states .",
    "here we provide a efficient scheme of transferring @xmath87-qubit entangled states in our quantum memory registers . for low temperatures ,",
    "the initial @xmath87-qubit entangled state for @xmath88 can be expanded in the single - spin subspace @xmath89 . for the perfect quantum transmission ,",
    "the entangled state can occur at another @xmath87 sites from the @xmath90-th ring to @xmath91-th one after the time . by the analytical calculation ,",
    "it is found out that the perfect quantum transfer can be achieved in the condition of @xmath92 this means that the @xmath87-qubit entangled state can be transported perfectly by the adjustment of the effective intermolecular interactions .",
    "for an example of @xmath93 , the transferred state is @xmath94 .",
    "to access the quantum transfer in this system , the fidelity at time @xmath62 is used in the form of @xmath95 it is seen that the values of fidelity take on the periodic evolution with the time in fig .",
    "the perfect quantum transmission can be realized by the efficient manipulation of the effective intermolecular couplings .",
    "the multiqubit entangled @xmath2 state can be generated by chemically tuning the effective intermolecular interactions in the quantum system of @xmath0 weakly coupled antiferromagnetic molecular rings .",
    "this method can provide an important entanglement source for the scalable quantum search in solids . in the present work",
    ", the anisotropy of the effective spin hamiltonian can be chemically controlled by the selection of local linkers between electron spins of different rings . for low temperatures , the state carrying quantum information can be expanded in the single - spin subspace .",
    "the high precision of producing @xmath2 state at @xmath1 circumjacent rings can be satisfied with the consideration of a certain fluctuations . and the @xmath87-qubit entangled state can also be perfectly transferred at a series of periodic time in our quantum registers by means of the control of the effective long range couplings between molecular rings .",
    "this is also an efficient proposal for the quantum router @xcite in which the communication can be directed between any chosen rings .",
