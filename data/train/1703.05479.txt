    "galactic black holes candidates ( bhcs ) are situated generally in binary systems .",
    "some of these sources are transient in nature .",
    "these black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrb ) spend most of their lifetime in the quiescent states .",
    "occasionally , they show outbursts in which high energy radiation intensity increases by a factor of hundred or more .",
    "a possible explanation is that an outburst is triggered by the sudden rise in viscosity in the accreting matter coming from the companion ( chakrabarti & titarchuk 1995 ; ebisawa et al .",
    "the mass transfer from the companion to the compact object can occur via roche lobe overflow or by wind accretion depending on the nature of the companion .",
    "in general , if the companion is a low mass k or m type star , roche lobe overflow is expected .",
    "if the companion is a mass losing high massive star , such as a type of o , a or b , winds form and accretion of winds are expected . in a bhxrb , the matter does not fall radially on the compact object .",
    "rather , it forms an inward spiraling accretion disk around it .",
    "this disk emits electromagnetic radiation in the range from radio to @xmath2-rays .",
    "high energy radiations , such as x - rays , are very important to study the properties of black holes ( bhs ) , as they come from regions close to the bh event horizon and therefore carry accurate information about the compact object .    in general , x - ray spectrum consists of a multi - color black body type component of soft photons and a power - law ( pl ) type tail of hard photons .",
    "the multi - color black body component is believed to come from the standard accretion disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; novikov & throne 1973 ) while the pl component is believed to come from a hot - electron filled compton cloud region ( sunyaev & titarchuk 1980 , 1985 ) . in the two component advective flow ( tcaf )",
    "solution chakrabarti and his collaborators ( chakrabarti & titarchuk , 1995 , hereafter ct95 ; chakrabarti , 1997 ) , the so - called compton cloud is replaced with centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ( cenbol ) . in the tcaf solution ,",
    "the accretion disk consists of two components of accreting matter - a standard keplerian disk with temperature modified by the compton cloud and a sub - keplerian halo .",
    "the keplerian disk is a high viscous disk with high angular momentum while the sub - keplerian disk has low viscosity and low angular momentum .",
    "the sub - keplerian halo piles up at the centrifugal barrier and an axisymmetric shock is formed ( chakrabarti 1990 ) .",
    "the soft photons from the keplerian disk are inverse - comptonized at the post - shock region and become hard photons .",
    "cenbol is also considered to be the base of jet ( chakrabarti 1999 ) .",
    "its oscillation is believed to cause low frequency quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) .",
    "qpos are observed if resonance conditions are satisfied when infall timescale roughly matches with the cooling time scale ( molteni et al .",
    "1996 ; chakrabarti et al . 2015 ) or the rankine - hugoniot conditions are not satisfied ( ryu et al .",
    "the observed frequency of the qpos are inversely proportional to the infall time in the post - shock region ( chakrabarti & manickam 2000 ) .",
    "recently , debnath and his collaborators have successfully included this most generalized accretion solution into heasarc s spectral analysis software package xspec ( arnaud 1996 ) as an additive table model ( debnath et al .",
    "2014 ; mondal et al .",

    "2015a , b , hereafter dmc15 , dmcm15 respectively ; jana et al .",
    "2016 , hereafter jdcmm16 ; chatterjee et al .",
    "2016 , hereafter cdcmj16 ) to find the nature of accretion flow properties of a few transient bh sources during their x - ray outbursts .",
    "apart from the mass of the black hole and constant normalization , one requires four parameters ( two types of accretion rates , shock location and compression ratio ) to fit a bh spectrum with the tcaf solution in xspec .",
    "transient bhxrbs show several spectral states during an entire outburst , which could be well understood by observing variations of these physical flow parameters and nature of qpos .",
    "four spectral states , namely , hard ( hs ) , hard - intermediate ( hims ) , soft intermediate ( sims ) and soft state ( ss ) are commonly observed in an outburst of a transient bhc . in a typical outburst ,",
    "bhcs generally stay in the hs at the start of an outburst .",
    "after that , it enters into the hims , sims and ss one by one .",
    "the shock moves closer to the black hole as it moves to the softer state and before disappearing altogether in soft / very soft state .",
    "the declining phase starts when the matter supply to the inner disk is turned off . during this phase of an outburst ,",
    "the shock moves away from the black hole and the spectra start to become harder .",
    "generally sims , hims and hs are observed one after another , to complete the hysteresis loop of the spectral states ( see , debnath et al .",
    "2013 and references therein ) .    in general , in the harder states ( hs and hims ) ,",
    "the halo rate dominates while in the softer states ( sims and ss ) , the disk rate dominates . from the spectral fits of data of each day with tcaf solution , we can also estimate the mass of black hole more accurately using constant normalization method ( molla et al . 2016 ; hereafter mdcmj16 ) . according to the tcaf solution ,",
    "model normalization ( n ) should not vary on a daily basis , since it only depends on the mass , distance and disk inclination angle @xmath3 of the disk , unless precession in the disk occurs to change the projected surface of the emission area or there are some significant outflow activities which are not included in current tcaf model _ fits _ file .",
    "this method has been successfully applied to estimate masses of few transient galactic bhcs , such as , maxi  j1659 - 152 ( mdcmj16 ) , maxi  j1836 - 194 ( jdcmm16 ) , maxi  j1543 - 564 ( cdcmj16 ) , h  1743 - 322 ( bhattacharjee et al . 2017 ; molla et al .",

    "moreover , mondal et al .",
    "( 2016 ) also estimated spin parameter of bhc gx  339 - 4 , from their spectral study of the relativistic broadening of the double fe - line with combined tcaf plus laor model fits using swift / xrt and nustar / fma data of the 2013 outburst .",

    "cadolle bel et al .",
    "( 2007 ) estimated the distance of the system is likely to be in between @xmath12  kpc .",

    "( 2014 ) calculated the source distance as @xmath13  kpc for inclination of @xmath14 and @xmath15 kpc for inclination of @xmath16 .",
    "the secondary companion is also reported to be a k or m type main - sequence star ( bell et .",
    "al 2007 ) .",
    "radio jet was also observed during the 2005 outburst of source ( fender et al .",
    "2005 ; soleri et al .",
    "the source is still active in hs with observable low luminosity x - ray intensities .",
    "in fact , the source has not gone into the quiescent state , since its discovery .",
    "the source was active over 11 years before going to quiescence state in november , 2016 ( shaw et al .",

    "recent studies of different transient bhcs show that outbursts are of two types : type - i or classical type , where all spectral states ( hs @xmath18 ss via two intermediate states , hims and sims ) are observed , and type - ii or harder type , where ss ( sometimes even sims ) are absent .",

    "photons in the multi - color blackbody type spectral component are mainly originated from the keplerian disk , where as photons in the comptonized part originate from the cenbol .",
    "since the keplerian disk in the pre - shock region is also heated up by absorbing hard radiations from the cenbol , it is not exactly the standard keplerian disk as explained in ct95 .",

    "spectra are fitted with the current version ( v0.3 ) of the tcaf solution _ fits _ file to extract physical accretion flow parameters , such as , keplerian disk rate ( @xmath39 ) , sub - keplerian halo rate ( @xmath43 ) in eddington rate , shock location ( @xmath46 ) in @xmath47 and shock compression ratio ( @xmath55 ) , and mass of the bh .",
    "a comparison is made with the spectral analysis result done with the combined dbb and pl models .",
    "a combined analysis of dbb and pl model gives us a rough estimation of disk temperature , photon indices and thermal and non - thermal flux contributions , etc .",
    "however , a tcaf model fits provide us with the evolution of the physical parameters relating to the accretion flow itself .",
    "variation of tcaf extracted parameters together with arr , and observed qpos help us to determine the spectral state of the bhc .",
    "we conclude that this source has been in two harder ( hs and hims ) spectral states during the 2005 outburst , although there are many reports from other authors that during the entire outburst phase source was in low hs ( see , cadolle bel et al . 2007 ; ramadevi & seetha 2007 ) .",
    "no signature of softer ( sims and ss ) spectral states are observed by us . the reason may be the short orbital period ( @xmath75  hrs , zurita et al .",
    "2007 ) of the binary system which makes the system very compact .",
    "there is a general excess of matter surrounding the whole system .",
    "so , there may be a constant supply of sub - keplerian matter from the wind .",
    "this is also the reason that the outburst continued till date in hs with low x - ray intensity . since during the outburst",
    ", this source does not follow canonical hysteresis loop of hid or ` q'-diagram or arrid ( see , jdcmm16 and references therein ) , as it never visited softer spectral states , the 2005 outburst of swift  j1753.5 - 0127 may be termed as a ` failed ' outburst .",
    "several other bhcs , such as , maxi  j1659 - 152 , maxi  j1836 - 194 , xte  j1118 + 480 ,",
    "swift  j1357.2 - 0933 also have shown similar behavior during their outbursts .",
    "similar to maxi  j1836 - 194 during its 2011 outburst ( jdcmm16 ) , the spectral states are observed in the sequence of : hs ( ris . ) @xmath57 hims ( ris . )",
    "@xmath57 hims ( dec . ) @xmath57 hs ( dec . )",
    "to form a hysteresis loop without softer spectral states .",
    "x - ray intensities , qpo frequencies as well as two component accretion rates , pl indices rise during initial five days of the outburst .",
    "this phase of the outburst is divided into hs ( ris . ) and hims ( ris . ) with a transition on the 2nd observation ( 2005 july 4 ; mjd=53557.24 ) , when a sharp rise in above mentioned parameters from the first observation and a local maximum of the arr are observed .",
    "this property is found to be a common feature on hs @xmath18 hims transition days , observed for other transient bhcs , such as h  1743 - 322 , gx  339 - 4 , maxi  j1659 - 152 , maxi  j1836 - 194 during their outbursts ( see , mdc14 , dmc15 , dmcm15 , jdcmm16 ) .",
    "after that , x - ray intensity , qpo frequency as well as two component accretion rates are observed to decrease with time ( day ) till the end of our observations .",
    "we define this phase of the outburst into two declining harder spectral states , i.e. , hims ( dec . ) and hs ( dec . ) . the transition between these spectral states is defined on 2005 august 7 ( mjd=53589.49 ) , since after that qpo frequencies , arrs , pl",
    "indices become roughly constant .",
    "our definition of 2005 july 6 ( mjd=53557.24 ) observation as the transition between two hard - intermediate spectral states is clearly justified as on this particular observation maximum values of x - ray intensities , qpo frequencies , keplerian rates are observed .",
    "qpo frequencies monotonically increase during the rising phase of the outburst , whereas during the declining phase of the outburst a general trend of decreasing nature of qpo frequencies is observed though on a daily basis the decrease is not monotonic",
    ". there may be some turbulence present in the flow . according to the tcaf solution , origin of these low frequency qpos",
    "could easily be explained by the resonance oscillation ( type - c ) , weak oscillation ( type - b ) of the compton cloud boundary ( i.e. , shock ) or even of the shock - free centrifugal barrier ( type - a ) .",
    "so , we suspect that during the non - qpo days ( in the declining hs ) , resonance condition between cooling and infall time of the post - shock region was not satisfied by a large margin ( see , chakrabarti et al . , 2015 for more details ) .    through tcaf fits , we find that an outburst of a transient bhc is manifested due to a large supply of keplerian and sub - keplerian matter close to the inner disk .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that this is due to rapid rise in viscosity , perhaps of magnetic origin , owing to enhanced magnetic activity in the companion or convective turbulence at the outer disk ( chakrabarti 2013 ) .",
    "similarly , declining phase of an outburst starts when supply from the companion is turned off , i.e. , due to low supply of the high viscous matter .",
    "although the 2005 outburst of galactic bhc swift  j1753.5 - 0127 started in the canonical way , it did not move to the burst - off phase for over a decade now .",
    "this may be due to the constant supply of matter from the companion star , most probably in the form of wind flow of low angular momentum low viscous sub - keplerian halo matter .",
    "for this reason , sometimes even for high accretion rate in the keplerian component could not able to cross the comparative limiting value , such that source reaches soft spectral state .",
    "the binary system , swift  j1753.5 - 0127 seems to belong to a type - ii class of outbursting sources along with maxi  j1836 - 194 , maxi  j1659 - 152 , xte  j1118 + 480 , etc .",
    "of shorter orbital periods , where softer spectral states are also missing during their outbursts",
    ".    for comparison of parameters obtained from tcaf fits with those we have obtained from dbb & pl model , we compute the @xmath76 , the inner edge of the so - called truncated standard disk . in tcaf fits , @xmath46 is the shock location which is the inner boundary of a modified standard disk and the outer boundary of the cenbol .",
    "@xmath76 ( in @xmath77 ) computed from dbb normalization from the relation @xmath78 , where , @xmath79 is in @xmath80 @xmath81 and @xmath82 is inclination angle , is given in the table in appendix -i .",
    "the normalization is used for the whole spectrum to match photons emitted at the disk frame and those observed by us .",
    "@xmath76 , calculated from dbb norm , is not really a physical parameter . for instance , we see from the appendix table that on mjd=53583 , @xmath76 is less than 30 km . for a bh mass of @xmath83 @xmath84",
    ", @xmath76 goes inside the event horizon which is not possible .",
    "similar value of @xmath85 was found in seven more observations .",
    "in contrast , normalization in tcaf is constant across the spectral states and the size of the compton cloud @xmath46 could be tens to hundreds of schwarzschild radii away . in other word",
    ", tcaf solves for totally different physical parameters of the system than those from the dbb & pl model .",
    "it is important to note that according to tcaf , all the four parameters ( other than the mass and the normalization which do not change in principle on a daily basis , unless there are addition sources of photons from jets ) , are essential to fit any general data from a stellar mass black hole having no outflows or magnetic field . in certain period of time , one or more parameters may be constant or nearly constant as special case .",
    "for instance in soft / very soft states , only accretion rate of the disk @xmath86 would be required , and two components are not necessary .",
    "fitting with dbb plus pl models often requires an additional ` reflection ' component to take care of a ` bump ' like features . in tcaf",
    "this is automatically produced when the keplerian disk is heated up by the fraction of incident comptonized photons from the cenbol .",
    "thus we do not require this additional component .",
    "it is not unlikely that this reprocessing may not fully account for the reflection component , especially when the disk is partly ionized .",
    "however , in our case the keplerian disk is flanked by a hot advective flow , and thus this problem of partial ionization , especially closer to the black hole , does not arise .",
    "all the four parameters play crucial role in fitting a spectrum even it appears to have simple features .",
    "the coupled differential equations given in ct95 produce a spectrum in a self - consistent way .",
    "keplerian disk component , depending on its accretion rate @xmath86 , emits seed photons , a fraction of which are intercepted by the cenbol .",
    "the fraction depends on the optical depth , height ( related to the cenbol temperature ) of the cenbol , and hence depends on all four parameters .",
    "the degree of comptonization of the seed photons will decide the pl slope of the spectrum .",
    "if the cenbol size ( @xmath46 ) gets reduced , it it expected that it should be easier to cool it since the optical depth is much higher in a denser region .",
    "however , the reduction in size reduces the path length as well as the number of intercepted seed photons from the keplerian flow .",
    "the compression ratio ( @xmath55 ) increases the density in cenbol by this factor , causing more comptonization .",
    "the internal density of the cenbol depends on the sum of the two rates ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) of the accretion flow .",
    "as the cenbol cools down with higher @xmath86 , the possibility of thermal pressure driven jets from cenbol becomes lesser .",
    "thus in tcaf scenario , jets and outflows are possible in harder states .",
    "in sort , all the four parameters play their roles in a complex and non - linear way .",
    "it is true that when the disk rate is very small , as shown in ct95 , the spectral slope is fairly insensitive to the rate , till the time the disk rate becomes comparable to the halo rate to cool cenbol down .",
    "so one would imagine that the @xmath86 would be degenerate .",
    "this is not true , since the same rate also is responsible for the multi - color blackbody bump . on the other hand",
    ", the resulting spectral slope would be different when the mass changes , since changes the seed photon temperature , without changing the advective flow properties .",
    "hence the information of mass enters through the spectral properties of the softer component .",
    "since tcaf obtains the entire spectrum at a time at the rest frame of the emitter , only one normalization is needed to map the whole spectrum with the observed spectrum . there could be fluctuations due to observational errors , but our model normalization is not expected to change violently for the same object unless there are addition source of x - rays from the base of the outflows and jets .",
    "thus the average normalization obtained from one outburst is expected to fit the data in other outbursts as well .    using tcaf , we also estimated probable range of the mass of the bhc from our tcaf model fitted spectral study .",
    "mass of the bh is an important parameter of the current tcaf model _ fits _",
    "file , which was kept free while fitting spectra .",
    "we assumed the model normalization to remain constant ( as in mdcmj16 ) to estimate mass of the source to be about @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "tcaf model normalization ( n ) does not vary significantly for a particular bhc even when it passes through different outbursts and spectral states , unless there is a precession in the disk which may change the projected surface of the emission area or there are some significant outflow activities which we missed to include in current model",
    "_ fits _ file . during the entire 2005 outburst of swift  j1753.5 - 0127 ,",
    "model normalization is found to be constant at @xmath73 with a little variation in between @xmath90 .",
    "a large deviation ( n @xmath74 ) is observed in five observations during the hims ( dec . ) , and this may be due to high jet emissions ( soleri et al . 2010 ) during that period of observations , whose effects were not included in the current version of the tcaf model fits file . in future , we will calculate x - ray flux coming from the jet and study their variations during the outburst using the variation of n during an outburst .",
    "this will be published elsewhere .",
    "a broad band x - ray study of the source starting from july 2005 till date , using archival data of rxte ( pca and hexte instruments ) and swift ( xrt and bat instruments ) satellites will also be done and published elsewhere .",
