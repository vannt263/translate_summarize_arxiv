    "in a helical flow both energy and helicity are inviscid invariants which are cascaded from the integral scale to the dissipation scale @xcite .",
    "if these scales for the helicity are separated there will be an inertial range in which an equivalent of the four - fifth law for helicity transfer holds .",
    "this is a scaling relation for a third order structure function with a different tensorial structure from the structure function associated with the flux of energy . for helicity flux",
    "this is , @xmath0\\rangle   = ( 2/15 ) \\overline{\\delta}l^2 $ ] , where @xmath1 is the mean dissipation of helicity .",
    "this relation is called the two - fifteenth law due to the numerical prefactor @xcite .",
    "the inertial ranges for helicity cascade and for energy cascade are different because the dissipation of helicity scales as @xmath2 , thus the helicity will be dissipated within the inertial range for energy cascade . from balancing the helicity flux and the helicity dissipation a kolmogorov scale @xmath3 for helicity dissipation",
    "can be defined ,    @xmath4    where @xmath5 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath6 is the mean energy dissipation per unit mass and @xmath1 is the mean helicity dissipation per unit mass .",
    "this scale is larger than the usual kolmogorov scale @xmath7 .    the physical picture for fully developed helical turbulence",
    "is shown schematically in figure 1 .",
    "the mean dissipations @xmath1 and @xmath6 are solely determined by the forcing in the integral scale .",
    "there will then be an inertial range with coexisting cascades of energy and helicity with third order structure functions determined by the four - fifth  and the two - fifteenth laws .",
    "this is followed by an inertial range between @xmath8 and @xmath9 corresponding to non - helical turbulence , where the dissipation of positive and negative helicity vortices balance and the two - fifteenth law is not applicable .",
    "there is now experimental evidence that the k41 scaling relations are not exact .",
    "there are corrections for moments different from 3 , expressed through anomalous scaling exponents , @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "understanding and quantitatively determining the anomalous scaling exponents is one of the most intriguing and unsolved problems in turbulence .",
    "the intermittency corrections to the k41 scaling could depend on the transfer of helicity , maybe similar to the way the different sectors in anisotropic turbulence might give rise to sub - leading corrections of scaling exponents @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the helicity cascade itself leads to a set of anomalous scaling exponents related to moments of the third order correlator of the two - fifteenth law .",
    "there is at present no experimental measurements from helical turbulence of the scaling exponents associated with the two - fifteenth law .",
    "it was recently shown numerically by biferale et al .",
    "@xcite that in the case of a shell model the anomalous scaling exponents for the helicity transfer has a strong difference between odd and even powers such that the scaling exponent @xmath12 is not a convex function .",
    "biferale et al . used a shell model consisting of two coupled goy shell models .",
    "we will show here that the results obtained holds for the standard goy shell model as well .",
    "shell models are toy - models of turbulence which by construction have second order inviscid invariants similar to energy and helicity in 3d turbulence .",
    "shell models can be investigated numerically for high reynolds numbers , in contrast to the navier - stokes equation , so that high order statistics and anomalous scaling exponents are easily accessible .",
    "shell models lack any spatial structures so we stress that only certain aspects of the turbulent cascades have meaningful analogies in the shell models .",
    "this should especially be kept in mind when studying helicity which is intimately linked to spatial structures , and the dissipation of helicity to reconnection of vortex tubes @xcite .",
    "the following thus only concerns the spectral aspects of the helicity and energy cascades .",
    "the goy model @xcite is the most well studied shell model .",
    "it is defined from the governing equation ,    @xmath13    with @xmath14 where the @xmath15 s are the complex shell velocities .",
    "the wave numbers are defined as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the shell spacing .",
    "the second and third terms are dissipation and forcing .",
    "the model has two inviscid invariants , energy , @xmath18 , and helicity , @xmath19 .",
    "the model has two free parameters , @xmath17 and @xmath20 .",
    "the helicity only has the correct dimension of helicity if @xmath21 . in this work",
    "we use the standard parameters @xmath22 for the goy model .",
    "a natural way to define the structure functions of moment @xmath23 is through the transfer rates of the inviscid invariants ,    @xmath24    the energy flux is defined in the usual way as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the time rate of change due to the non - linear term in ( [ 1 ] ) .",
    "the helicity flux @xmath27 is defined similarly . by a simple algebra we have the following expression for the fluxes ,    @xmath28    where @xmath29 , @xmath6 and @xmath1 are the mean dissipations of energy and helicity respectively .",
    "the first equalities hold without averaging as well .",
    "these equations are the shell model equivalents of the four - fifth  and the two - fifteenth law .    in the definition ( [ s3e ] ) , ( [ s3h ] ) of the structure functions",
    "there is a slight ambiguity in the definition of @xmath30 for negative @xmath31 and @xmath23 not a multiplum of 3 .",
    "the complex roots for @xmath32 are @xmath33 and for @xmath34 they are @xmath35 .",
    "the common way of circumventing the ambiguity is by defining @xmath36 , which neglects the imaginary roots has no real roots . ] . with this definition",
    "we have ,    @xmath37x^{p/3}dx \\equiv \\int_0^{\\infty}\\psi_n^+(x)x^{p/3}dx \\ , \\ , & ( p\\ , \\mbox { even } ) \\label{pdf1 } \\\\",

    "= 13.5 cm    the scaling exponents are determined from the scaling of the pdf s through ,    @xmath43    so the scaling exponents for @xmath23 even is related to the scaling of @xmath44 while for @xmath23 odd they are related to the scaling of @xmath45 .",
    "we have performed a simulation of the standard goy model with @xmath46 and a forcing of the form @xmath47 , corresponding to a constant energy input .",
    "the simulation was about @xmath48 large eddy turnover times .",
    "figure 2 shows the anomalous scaling exponents , @xmath49 for the energy and the helicity calculated according to ( [ pdf1 ] ) and ( [ pdf2 ] ) . using ( [ pdf1 ] ) the scaling exponent @xmath12 can be defined for any real positive @xmath23 , which from the hlder inequality is a convex curve . similarly using ( [ pdf2 ] ) assuming @xmath50 to be a positive function we can define a continuous curve @xmath51 which is also from the hlder inequality a convex curve . the scaling exponent @xmath12 defined for integer @xmath23 jumps between the two curves shown in figure 2 .",
    "the scaling exponents differs from the ones found by biferale et al .",
    "for the two - component goy model .",
    "we find that @xmath52 is slightly larger than @xmath53 .",
    "the scaling regime in which @xmath12 is calculated is @xmath54 while for the energy @xmath55 .",
    "the negative part of the probability density is negligible in the case of energy transfer , @xmath56 for @xmath57 , but for helicity transfer the negative tail is big which gives the strong even - odd oscillations between the two curves .",
    "note that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are just the four - fifth  and the two - fifteenth law .",

    "the negative tail is plotted as @xmath63 which for a symmetric pdf gives two overlapping curves .",
    "we can similarly define the pdf @xmath64 .",
    "a simple algebra gives @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "so we see that the scaling of @xmath67 is related to the scaling of the mean of the two curves in the right panels in figure 3 , while the scaling of @xmath68 is related to the gap between the two curves .",
    "coexisting cascades of energy and helicity are possible in the goy shell model .",
    "the scaling of the odd order moments of the helicity transfer depends on the scaling of the anti - symmetric part of the probability density function for the helicity flux .",
    "this defines a convex anomalous scaling curve through the point @xmath59 which is the two - fifteenth law .",
    "the even order moments of the helicity flux has anomalous scaling exponents close to the ones found for the energy flux . in the simulation",
    "a scale break at @xmath8 is not observed .",
    "this implies that the anomalous scaling exponents for the energy flux are not influenced by the cascade of helicity .",
