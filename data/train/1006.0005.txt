    "massive young stellar clusters are outstanding objects containing copious numbers of stars over the entire stellar mass range . with masses between @xmath6m@xmath7 and 10@xmath8m@xmath7 @xcite , they cover the upper end of the cluster mass function and may constitute progenitors of globular clusters ( gcs ; zhang & fall 1999 ; mccrady & graham 2007 ) . while extragalactic starburst clusters , such as those in the antennae galaxies , are often barely resolved @xcite , in milky way starburst clusters thousands of individual stars can be observed .",
    "in addition to three clusters in the galactic center region ( arches , quintuplet , young nuclear cluster ) , only a handful of milky way starburst clusters located in spiral arms have so far been identified ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . among the spiral arm clusters , the ngc3603youngcluster ( nyc ) , located in its namesake giant h ii region ngc3603 @xcite , is the most compact and youngest cluster with an age of @xmath9myr @xcite and a central density @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it hosts three wolf  rayet stars , at least 6 o2/o3 , and 30 late o - type stars @xcite , and is extensively referenced as a template for extragalactic starburst environments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "previously , dynamical studies of galactic starburst clusters were largely restricted to one - dimensional velocity dispersions derived from radial velocity measurements of a few of the most luminous cluster members ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . using multi - epoch observations of gcs , king & anderson ( 2001 , 2002 ) and anderson & king ( 2003a ) pioneered high precision proper motion studies with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) , which enabled the distinction of gc members from field stars , and the study of gc dynamics and kinematics .    in 2006",
    ", we initiated an extensive observational program to obtain multi - epoch high - angular resolution imaging observations of galactic starburst clusters with the aim to study their internal dynamics and global motions . here , we present the results of our analysis of two epochs of _ hst _ observations of nyc separated by 10.15yr .",
    "accurate proper motions enable us to get a `` clean '' census of the cluster population by rejecting field stars and to study the internal cluster dynamics .",
    "two epochs of observations of ngc3603 with the _ hst_/wide - field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) separated by 10.15 yr are analyzed .",
    "we compare planetary camera ( pc1 ) observations in f547 m and f814w from epoch 1 ( go 6763 , archival data ) with our second epoch observations in f555w and f814w ( go 11193 ) . with an image scale of 45.5mas @xmath11 , pc1 provides the best point - spread function ( psf ) sampling of the wfpc2 cameras . while the first epoch observations were carried out in stare mode , for the second epoch we selected a four - point sub - pixel dither pattern to facilitate bad pixel recovery and to provide an improved psf sampling .",
    "table [ obslog ] summarizes the observations , including individual and total exposure times .",
    "data reduction has been performed with iraf / pyraf .",
    "we combined the individual bias subtracted , flat - fielded images with identical exposure times using @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "this corrects for velocity aberration and geometrical distortion including the 34th column anomaly based on the latest distortion correction . for the second epoch observations we applied 2@xmath132 oversampling .",
    "astrometry and photometry were derived from the drizzled images for each filter and exposure time setting using daophot @xcite with a penny2 psf varying linearly across the field . near the faint end , where the photometric uncertainties start to increase ,",
    "the star list was filled in by the results derived from the next longer exposure , and uncertainties assessed accordingly .",
    "the final number of detections in each band and epoch for a @xmath14 threshold above the background noise is listed in table  [ obslog ] .",
    "photometric calibration is based on the zero points provided by dolphin ( 2000 ) .",
    "photometric correction for charge transfer efficiency follows the recipe provided by a.dolphin , and the astrometric correction is based on equation 7 of kozhurina - platais et al .",
    "( 2007 ) with the values for @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 given in table  [ param ] ( note the different pixel scale due to 2@xmath132 oversampling for the second epoch ) .",
    "the combined image has distortions reduced to a level of 0.02 pixel ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . due to the different orientation angle of 51@xmath18 between the two epochs",
    ", we have to consider the uncertainty of the position induced by the residual geometric distortion , @xmath19 . for sinusoidal pixel phase errors ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure  2 ) , the second epoch dithering pattern with 0.5 pixel shifts largely cancels out the pixel phase error . as the first epoch",
    "was observed in stare mode , the pixel phase error has to be considered . with a typical amplitude of the sinusoidal pixel phase error of @xmath200.02 pixel ,",
    "the uncertainty to be included in our analysis amounts to an average residual uncertainty of @xmath21pixel .",
    "simulations based on tinytim psfs @xcite indicate that the positional psf fitting uncertainty results in a centroiding error of @xmath22 pixel .",
    "the effect of _ hst _ breathing on pixel scale was determined by measuring the separation of wide pairs of stars on frames obtained during different phases of _ hst _ s orbit , resulting in @xmath23 pixel .",
    "the combined contribution of these effects amounts to @xmath24mas .",
    "the observed proper motion dispersion has to be corrected for @xmath25 to derive the intrinsic velocity dispersion of the cluster members .",
    "as the orientation angles of the two epochs differ ( @xmath26),the common field available to our analysis is a circle with a diameter of @xmath27 . a geometric transformation based on a preliminary list of main - sequence ( ms ) cluster members is derived using iraf / geomap with a second - order polynomial .",
    "stars detected in _",
    "i _ band with photometric psf fitting uncertainties @xmath28mag are matched after applying this transformation , and individual proper motions are calculated for each star . in this reference frame ,",
    "cluster members center around ( 0,0 ) in the proper motion vector point diagram .",
    "the final proper motion table contains 829 matched stars .",
    "in figure  [ fig1 ] ( left ) we show the measured proper motions for all stars with respect to the cluster reference frame in galactic coordinates .",
    "the symmetrical distribution of all proper motions around ( 0,0 ) indicates the absence of any large relative motion of the cluster with respect to the field , i.e. , the cluster follows the galactic rotation curve . as nyc s galactic longitude of l=291.6@xmath18 implies an almost tangential view into the carina spiral arm ,",
    "the distributions of cluster member and field star proper motions are superimposed .",
    "this proper motion distribution is fitted by a two - component gaussian with the wide function describing predominantly foreground stars , and hence non - cluster members ( dashed line in figure  [ fig1 ] , top right ) , and the narrow component is interpreted as cluster member candidates .",
    "we calculate cluster membership probabilities @xmath29 as described in jones & walker ( 1988 ) and consider stars as cluster members if @xmath30 .",
    "this significantly reduces the number of contaminating field stars , but due to the similar proper motions of cluster and field , some field stars might remain in the cluster sample . based on besanon models @xcite",
    ", we estimate the number of field stars in our field of view to be 46 stars between @xmath31mag . including stars with a membership probability above 0.9 in our cluster sample",
    ", we subtracted a total of 58 stars as field stars . for the variable stars _",
    "hst _ 12 , 474 , 481 , and 574 , studied by moffat et al.(2004 ) , we found membership probabilities @xmath29 of 0.75 , 0.98 , 0.90 , and 0.98 , respectively , indicating that the latter three are likely cluster members .",
    "the @xmath32 , @xmath33 cmd is shown in figure  [ fig2 ] ( left ) .",
    "the distinction between candidate cluster members ( small dots ) and field stars ( open circles ) as described in section  [ motions ] leads to a very well defined cluster sequence with high - mass ms stars , intermediate - mass stars located in the pre - main - sequence ( pms)ms transition region between @xmath34mag and 20mag , and more than 300 lower mass pms stars down to @xmath35mag ( figure  [ fig2 ] , middle ) .",
    "the efficiency of the proper motion member selection is evident in the left panel of figure 2 , particularly among pms and faint stars that could not be distinguished from cluster members from their colors alone .",
    "the foreground sequence blueward of the pms does likely not belong to the cluster , suggesting a residual contamination of  18 stars with 20mag@xmath36mag .    in the following ,",
    "we assume solar metallicity @xcite for the cluster and the relation between absolute and selective extinction from schlegel et al .",
    "the upper ms is well fitted by a 1myr padova isochrone ( * ? ? ?",
    "* black solid line along the ms in the right panel of figure  [ fig2 ] ) for @xmath0=4.7mag and a distance modulus of 14.1mag .",
    "for the analysis of the pms  ms transition region and the lower mass pms we use siess models @xcite , transformed by da rio et al .",
    "( 2009 , s00/dr ) , as well as pisa - franec models ( deglinnocenti et al .",
    "2008 , pf09 ) , transformed into the observational plane using atlas 9 model atmospheres @xcite .",
    "the best - fitting isochrones yield a distance between 6.6kpc ( pf09 ) and 6.9kpc ( s00/dr ) and a visual extinction @xmath0=4.7mag ( pf09 ) and 4.6mag ( s00/dr ) , respectively for an age of 1myr .",
    "we note that the derived selective extinction is in good agreement with @xmath37 = 1.25mag as reported by sung & bessell ( 2004 ) , though the absolute extinction value derived by us is slightly higher due to the use of the schlegel et al .",
    "the 1myr pf09 isochrone represents the pms best , in particular at the pms  ms transition region .    at an age of 1 myr",
    ", stars with masses between 3.5 and 3.8m@xmath7 are expected to be in the short - lived radiative  convective ( r  c ) gap phase @xcite .",
    "this phase corresponds to the formation of a radiative core in the interior of the stars , due to the increasing central temperature @xcite .",
    "we observe eight sources in the r  cgap at 18.5mag@xmath38mag ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) and @xmath39mag ( shown as diamonds in the right panel of figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "if their pms nature is spectroscopically confirmed , this is the first identification of pms stars in this interesting evolutionary stage .",
    "a previously unreported cmd feature is the apparent extension of the ms toward lower masses below the pms",
    " ms transition region ( @xmath40mag ) .",
    "isochrone fitting to the ms turn - on yields an age of 4myr .",
    "the derived age is consistent with recent estimates of the age of the two blue supergiants sher23 and sher25 @xcite .",
    "these stars might represent an earlier epoch of star formation in the giant hii region ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "the distribution @xmath41 of the proper motions @xmath42 , as shown in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig1 ] , is a combination of internal velocity dispersion and instrumental effects , resulting in @xmath43 . in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig1 ]",
    "we show the observed one - dimensional proper motion dispersion as a function of stellar magnitude in bins of 1 mag for candidate cluster members .",
    "the velocity dispersion is constant for stars with 14.5mag @xmath44 18.5mag ( @xmath451.79m@xmath1 ) .    correcting the observed one - dimensional proper motion dispersion of @xmath46as / yr for the instrumental effects discussed in section[obs ] results in an intrinsic one - dimensional velocity dispersion @xmath47as yr@xmath4 for stars brighter than @xmath4818.5mag , assuming a negligible effect of binary orbital motions ( girard et al .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath49 km s@xmath4 at a distance of 6.75kpc .",
    "the constant velocity dispersion for stars in the mass range 1.79m@xmath1 indicates a lack of equipartition of energy among cluster members .",
    "this provides a strong indication that nyc is far from virial equilibrium .",
    "nevertheless , an upper limit of the cluster mass can be obtained by deriving the virial mass @xmath50 from the observed velocity dispersion @xcite :    @xmath51    where @xmath52 ( weakly depending on cluster density structure ) , @xmath53 is the half - mass radius , @xmath54 is the three - dimensional velocity dispersion , and _",
    "g _ is the gravitational constant .",
    "nyc is mass segregated with its core radius increasing with decreasing stellar mass @xcite . a lower limit on @xmath55 for the high - mass stars as derived from _ hst _",
    "data is comparable to the core radius of @xmath450.2pc ( stolte 2003 ) , whereas harayama et al .",
    "( 2008 ) based on the analysis of near - infrared adaptive optics data estimate @xmath55 = 0.71.5pc for stars in the mass range 0.52.5m@xmath1 .",
    "if we assume @xmath55 = 0.5pc and a three - dimensional velocity dispersion of @xmath56 km s@xmath4 , we derive @xmath57 .    considering that this dynamical mass estimate provides an upper limit , it is in agreement with photometric studies of nyc , which assigned masses to individual stars , and estimated the total stellar mass to @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "based on two epochs of high - accuracy astrometric _",
    "hst_/wfpc2 observations separated by 10.15yr , relative proper motions of 829 stars were measured . a selection of candidate cluster members with @xmath59 results in a clean cluster cmd .",
    "the best - fitting isochrone yields an age of 1myr , a distance of 6.66.9kpc , and @xmath0=4.6 - 4.7mag for the pms and intermediate - mass ms cluster members .",
    "stars at the location of the short - lived radiative convective gap , which occurs at 3.53.8m@xmath7 at the age of nyc , are identified for the first time .",
    "we find hints of a sparse young low - mass population with an age of @xmath60myr , which might constitute an earlier generation of star formation in ngc3603 , and likely represents the low - mass counterparts to several blue supergiants in the vicinity of nyc .",
    "for the first time , the internal velocity dispersion of the starburst cluster nyc could be measured . for stars with masses 1.7m@xmath61m@xmath62m@xmath1 , we determine a one - dimensional velocity dispersion of @xmath63as yr@xmath4 , corresponding to @xmath5 km s@xmath4 at a distance of 6.75kpc .",
    "from the fact that the velocity dispersion does not vary with stellar mass in this mass range , we deduce that nyc has not yet reached equipartition of energy .",
    "this is not entirely unexpected at the young age of the cluster , since its crossing time is estimated to be 1.4myr by nrnberger & petr - gotzens ( 2002 ) .",
    "the same might be true for many extragalactic starburst clusters , where mass estimates rely on the measurements of velocity dispersions .",
    "if these clusters are also not yet in virial equilibrium , their masses might be systematically overestimated .",
    "thus , nyc provides an important benchmark for our understanding of the early dynamical evolution and the long - term survival of young , massive stellar clusters in the milky way and in other galaxies .",
