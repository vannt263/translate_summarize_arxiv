    "derived as the variational equations from a lagrangian , the supergravity equations are as follows : @xmath5    the nonlinear supergravity operator has an edge structure in the sense of mazzeo @xcite , which is a natural generalization in the context of the product of a conformally compact manifold and a compact manifold .",
    "we consider those solutions that are sections of the edge bundles , which are rescalings of the usual form bundles .",
    "the fredholm property of certain elliptic edge operators is related to the invertibility of the corresponding normal operator @xmath6 , which is the lift of the operator to the front face of the double stretched space @xmath7 .",
    "the invertibility of the normal operator is in turn related to its action on functions polyhomogeneous at the left boundary of @xmath7 , which is determined by the indicial operator .",

    "kantor studied this problem in his thesis  @xcite , where he computed the indicial roots of the system and produced one family of solutions by varying along a specific direction of the form .",
    "here we use a different decomposition that gives the same indicial roots and show that all the solutions nearby are prescribed by boundary data for the linearized operator , more specifically , the indicial kernels corresponding to three pairs of special indicial roots .      the 11-dimension supergravity theory contains the following information on an 11-dimensional manifold @xmath14 : gravity metric @xmath15 and a 4-form @xmath16 . in this theory , the lagrangian @xmath10 is defined as @xmath17 here r is the scalar curvature of the metric g , a is a 3-form such that f is the field strength @xmath18 .",
