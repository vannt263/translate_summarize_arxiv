    "entanglement is the central theme in quantum information processing .",
    "it allows to design faster algorithms than classically , to communicate in a secure way , or to perform protocols that have no classical analogue .",
    "entangled states of few particles ( e.g. photons , ions ) can be routinely created in experiments , and their entanglement can be confirmed using state tomography , bell inequalities or entanglement witnesses .",
    "all of these tools are well - established methods for the detection of entanglement . but can one be sure that they give a confirmative answer even when realistic , i.e. erroneous detectors are used ? here , we will introduce and study a loophole - problem for the detection of entanglement via witness operators .",
    "loophole - problems have been widely discussed in the context of ruling out local hidden variable ( lhv ) models , by measuring a violation of certain inequalities , as suggested in the seminal work of j.s .",
    "bell in 1964 @xcite .",
    "many experiments have been carried out along that line @xcite , but all of them so far suffer from the locality loophole ( i.e. no causal separation of the detectors ) and/or the detection loophole ( i.e. low detector efficiency ) . as a consequence of a loophole , quantum correlations are also explainable by lhv theories @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss a possible _ detection loophole _ for experiments that measure entanglement witnesses . here , the goal is not to prove the completeness of quantum mechanics ( as in bell experiments ) , but , assuming the correctness of quantum mechanics , to prove the existence of entanglement in a given state .",
    "one advantage of witness operators is that they require only few _ local _ measurements to detect entanglement @xcite ; global measurements are experimentally not easily accessible at present .",
    "a local projection measurement with realistic imperfect detectors ( in the computational basis , for qubits and isotropic noise ) can be described by the following positive operator valued measurement ( povm ) : @xmath0 and @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the efficiency of the detector . however , in general the _ global _ properties of the detectors are not fully characterised , e.g. there may exist correlations between povm elements of different detectors .",
    "provided that only local detector properties are given , what are the conditions for being nevertheless able to prove the existence of entanglement without doubt ?",
    "an entanglement witness @xmath3 is a hermitian operator that fulfils @xmath4 for all separable @xmath5-partite states @xmath6 @xcite , where the index @xmath7 numbers the subsystem , the probabilities @xmath8 are real and non - negative , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 for at least one entangled state @xmath11 @xcite . throughout this paper",
    ", we will use without loss of generality normalized witnesses , i.e. @xmath12 . our goal is to ensure that a negative measured expectation value @xmath13 is really due to the state being entangled , rather than to imperfect detectors .",
    "the following line of arguments also holds for specialized witnesses which are constructed such that , e.g. , they detect only genuine multi - partite entanglement @xcite or states prohibiting lhv models @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "after introducing the local decomposition of entanglement witnesses , we study the effect of lost events as well as additional events on the experimental expectation value of @xmath3 . here",
    ", we use the worst case approach to derive inequalities which need to be fulfilled to ensure entanglement of the given state .",
    "the parameters in these inequalities are the measured expectation value of the witness , the detection efficiencies , and the coefficients for the local decomposition of the witness .",
    "we show for the two - qubit case how to optimize the local operator decomposition of the witness , such that the detection efficiency which is needed to close the loophole is minimized .",
    "some recent experiments measuring witness operators are presented , to demonstrate that the detection loophole is a problem in current experiments .",
    "any witness for an @xmath5-partite quantum state in @xmath14 dimensions can be decomposed in a local operator basis , i.e. an @xmath5-fold tensor product of operators @xmath15 , @xmath16 where the coefficients @xmath17 are real .",
    "each operator @xmath15 is traceless or the identity and corresponds to the @xmath18th local setting for the party number @xmath7 . in this expansion , we include implicitly also the local identity operators which do not need to be measured . the number of terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq - wdec ] ) depends on the decomposition , i.e.  on the choice of operators @xmath15 . a straightforward , but not necessarily optimal choice ( concerning the needed detector efficiency ) are the @xmath19 hermitian generators @xmath20 of su(@xmath21 ) and the respective identity operators .",
    "in the following , we will use a simpler notation , namely @xmath22 where @xmath23 stands for one term from the local expansion ( [ witness ] ) . here , we exclude the identity @xmath24 ( acting on the total space ) from the sum over @xmath25 , because it does not have to be measured and therefore has a special role .",
    "we will now investigate one local measurement setting described by @xmath26 , and drop the index @xmath25 for convenience .",
    "the _ measured _ expectation value @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the @xmath18th eigenvalue of @xmath30 , the number of measured events for the @xmath18th outcome is denoted as @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the total number of measured events for that setting . in the second part of eq .",
    "( [ eq - settingexpect ] ) we expressed this expectation value as a sum of the ideal number of events , denoted as @xmath33 ( i.e. for perfect detectors ) , the additional events @xmath34 ( e.g.  dark counts ) and the lost events @xmath35 for the @xmath18th outcome .",
    "the total ideal number of events for such a setting is denoted as @xmath36 , and the total number of additional / lost events as @xmath37 .",
    "we have @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the experimental data usually gives no information about the number of errors @xmath40 for a specific measurement outcome @xmath18 .",
    "only the detection imperfections are known , namely the detection efficiency ( `` lost events efficiency '' ) : @xmath41 and the `` additional events efficiency '' : @xmath42 where @xmath43 holds . here , @xmath44 denotes the global detection efficiency for a given measurement setting . in the following , we assume that @xmath44 is the same for all settings .",
    "( other cases can be included by indexing @xmath44 with @xmath25 . )",
    "usually , one makes the fair - sampling assumption about the statistical distribution of the unknown errors @xmath45 , i.e.  one assumes the same statistical distribution for detected and lost events ; the additional events are assumed to have a flat distribution . here",
    ", we will give up this assumption and will consider the worst case , where both lost and additional events contribute such that the expectation value of the witness is shifted towards negative values .",
    "we point out that in order to reach this worst case scenario , it is already sufficient that the global povm elements exhibit certain classical correlations ( while being compatible with the local measurement operators ) @xcite .",
    "the worst case is equivalent to finding the lowest possible @xmath27 , which is achieved by minimizing the contribution of the additional events , and maximizing the contribution of the lost events in eq .",
    "( [ eq - settingexpect ] ) .",
    "this minimization / maximization can be easily shown to have the form @xmath46 and @xmath47 , with @xmath48 where @xmath49 denotes the heaviside function , and @xmath50 is the minimal / maximal eigenvalue of @xmath30 .    inserting this into eq .",
    "( [ eq - settingexpect ] ) , one finds the following worst case estimate for the measured expectation value @xmath27 : @xmath51 where @xmath52 . here , we have introduced the notation @xmath53 for the _ true _ expectation value ( without any errors ) .    using @xmath54 and eq .",
    "( [ expectvalue ] ) , with isotropic detection efficiencies , we can express the measured witness expectation value @xmath55 as a function of the _ true _",
    "one @xmath56 , for the worst case . to close the loophole it is necessary to ensure that @xmath57 .",
    "this leads to a condition for the maximal @xmath55 that depends on the decomposition of @xmath3 and the efficiencies @xmath58 : @xmath59 where we have re - introduced the summation index @xmath25 .",
    "> from now on we want to focus on the case where the subsystems are two - dimensional , i.e. qubits . for qubits",
    "the measurement operators @xmath23 are chosen to be tensor products of pauli operators with eigenvalues @xmath60 .",
    "this simplifies @xmath61 to @xmath62 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq - wmineq ] ) reads for qubits @xmath63 in fig .",
    "[ fig - wmetpetm ] a contour plot of this function is shown : given a certain measured expectation value @xmath55 , the corresponding efficiencies @xmath58 ensure that the state is indeed entangled .",
    "this plot assumes @xmath64 , and can be easily redrawn for other decompositions .",
    "> from eq .",
    "( [ eq - wmetpetmqbts ] ) it is obvious that an _",
    "optimal _ decomposition of such a witness with respect to the needed efficiencies @xmath58 is achieved by minimizing @xmath65 . for the case of two - qubit witnesses",
    "a constructive optimization can be achieved , when arbitrary local stern - gerlach measurements ( described by pauli operators or rotations thereof ) and the identity are allowed .",
    "we start with a two - qubit witness in its pauli operator decomposition , i.e.@xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the normalization condition @xmath69 leads to @xmath70 .",
    "the three remaining terms in eq.([eq-2qwitnessterms ] ) can be optimized separately ( note the special role of the identity ) .",
    "let us first consider the term @xmath71 .",
    "this expression is optimized by doing a singular value decomposition of the coefficient matrix @xmath72 , i.e.@xmath73 , where @xmath30 is the diagonal matrix that contains the singular values @xmath74 .",
    "the matrices @xmath75 and @xmath76 are orthogonal and have entries @xmath77 and @xmath78 . the new orthogonal basis is simply constructed by using the orthonormal rows of @xmath75 and @xmath76 , i.e.@xmath79 and @xmath80 , such that we get the schmidt operator decomposition @xmath81 with @xmath82 and the same orthogonality relation for party @xmath83 .",
    "the optimality of this biorthogonal decomposition with respect to the detector efficiencies is shown as follows : consider the most general decomposition @xmath84 , where @xmath85 are arbitrary ( not necessarily orthogonal ) rotated pauli operators and without loss of generality @xmath86 ( we can include a minus sign in one of the operators ) . here , the number of terms @xmath87 is finite and an operator may appear more than once .",
    "we can express this decomposition in terms of our orthogonal basis @xmath88 , @xmath89 with @xmath90 for all @xmath91 .",
    "the right hand sides of eq .",
    "( [ eq - optdec ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq - gendec ] ) are equal .",
    "we multiply these two expressions by @xmath92 and take the trace on both sides .",
    "this leads to @xmath93\\left [ \\tilde{\\sigma}_{am}\\otimes\\tilde{\\sigma}_{bm}\\right ] \\right ) }   =   \\nonumber\\\\   \\sum_{j , k , l , m } b_j\\alpha_k^{(j)}\\beta_l^{(j ) } { \\mathrm{tr}_{}\\ ! \\left ( \\left[\\tilde{\\sigma}_{ak}\\otimes\\tilde{\\sigma}_{bl }   \\right]\\left [ \\tilde{\\sigma}_{am}\\otimes\\tilde{\\sigma}_{bm}\\right ] \\right)}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] orthogonality of the basis is used to get @xmath94 where we used the fact that the scalar product between two normalized vectors ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) is less or equal to one .",
    "this proves the optimality of the decomposition of @xmath97 given in eq .",
    "( [ eq - optdec ] ) .    the third term in eq .",
    "( [ eq-2qwitnessterms ] )  and , analogously , the second one  can be written as @xmath98 where @xmath99 is a rotated pauli operator , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . following similar arguments as before , it is easy to verify that @xmath102 is optimal .",
    "the situation for higher dimensions is different : it is unfortunately not straightforward to generalize the above optimization to higher - dimensional witnesses , because we extensively used the fact that a linear combination of pauli operators is again a scaled rotated pauli operator . also , for multi - partite witnesses the schmidt decomposition eq .",
    "( [ eq - optdec ] ) does not always exist , such that our optimization method is not applicable for these cases .",
    "in many experimental situations , e.g.  when optical detectors are used , only the `` lost event efficiency '' is an important issue and the `` additional event efficiency '' is approximately @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "this situation further simplifies eq .",
    "( [ eq - wmineq ] ) , and the minimal detector efficiency that allows to close the loophole has a simple relation with the measured expectation value and the decomposition of the witness , namely @xmath104    this function is shown in fig .",
    "( [ fig - etamwm ] ) , where the hatched area corresponds to values for which the inequality is fulfilled , again assuming @xmath105 . for two qubits the detection loophole for witnesses can already be closed with a detection efficiency @xmath106 .",
    "this bound is sufficient e.g.  for the optimal two - qubit witness of a bell state and a measured expectation value of @xmath107 .",
    "we conjecture that for @xmath108 the loophole can not be closed for any witness .",
    "we now want to discuss some prominent experimental examples in this context . in ion trap experiments the detection efficiencies are close to one ( @xmath109 ) @xcite and",
    "the detection loophole is usually not an issue .",
    "exceptions are many - party - witnesses with expectation values close to zero , like the genuine 8-qubit multipartite entanglement witness experiment of hffner _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "single photon experiments on the other hand are more problematic . using eq .",
    "( [ eq - etamwm ] ) we give some explicit experimental examples for the needed detection efficiencies to close the witness loophole : m. barbieri _",
    "et al .  _",
    "@xcite implemented the optimal two - qubit entanglement witness to detect a bell state , where they achieved an expectation value of @xmath110 . in this case",
    "the detection efficiency needs to be @xmath111 . in recent experiments also multipartite entanglement witnesses",
    "were implemented @xcite . in this work",
    "the three - qubit ghz entanglement witness is loophole - free with a detection efficiency of @xmath112 , and the four - partite case needs @xmath113 .",
    "single photon detector efficiencies for wavelengths of 700 - 800 nm are typically around 70% @xcite , such that the global detection efficiency for two qubits is circa 50 % , and even lower for more than two subsystems .",
    "the detection efficiencies for multipartite witness experiments with photons are thus considerably below the needed thresholds .",
    "this is a similar situation as for the detection loophole in bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "however , there is a good chance for loophole - free witness experiments with two qubits , when slightly more efficient detectors are available .    in summary , we discussed the detection loophole problem for experiments measuring witness operators . assuming the worst case ( that may occur due to unknown global properties of the detectors ) we derived certain inequalities to close such loopholes .",
    "these inequalities are generally valid for any type of witness operator and depend on the measured expectation value of the witness , its local operator decomposition and the detector efficiencies .",
    "> from there , detector efficiency thresholds to close the loophole are easily calculated .",
    "the local decomposition of the witness can be optimized such that the needed detection efficiencies are minimized .",
    "we explicitly presented a constructive optimization for two - qubit witnesses . for multi - qubit witnesses the optimal decomposition",
    "is achieved by minimizing the sum of the absolute values of the expansion coefficients . in the case of higher - dimensional witnesses",
    "the optimization is not straightforward any more , because it then also depends on the type of operator basis .",
    "let us mention that an analogous study can be performed , if the witness is decomposed into local projectors @xcite ; this will be published elsewhere . for qubit witnesses we further considered the common experimental situation , where additional counts can be neglected .",
    "current witness experiments with polarized photons do not close the detection loophole , because of the low single photon detector efficiencies . ",
    "further research directions and open problems include the optimal local decomposition for higher - dimensional witnesses , and the case of erroneous detector orientations .
