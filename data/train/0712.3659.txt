    "extensive experimental and theoretical studies of multiple ionization in strong laser fields have revealed a number of unexpected features .",
    "while some phenomena can be described as multi - photon , independent electron processes , ( see e.g. @xcite ) , others require electron - electron correlations .",
    "this was concluded on the basis of a detailed analysis of experimental data together with precise calculations of single ionization rates @xcite .",
    "several experiments @xcite then revealed a pronounced `` knee '' structure in the yield vs peak laser intensity , typically plotted with logarithmic axis because of the wide range of values covered .",
    "further ingenious experiments that resolved the joint momentum distributions of the outgoing electrons then showed that they often leave the atom with the same momenta @xcite .",
    "this has triggered a number of theoretical studies of this process , including @xmath0-matrix calculations for the full cross sections @xcite , and investigations of simplified classical and quantum models . among the models",
    "are so - called aligned - electron models @xcite , in which electrons move in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) regularized coulomb potential , or quasi three - dimensional ( 3d ) ones with the center of mass of the electrons confined to move along the field polarization axis @xcite . on the other hand , an exact solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation for two electrons in a laser field remains a formidable task , accessible usually to very short pulses of wavelengths shorter than 800  nm @xcite .",
    "one of the keys to understanding the dynamics of double and higher multiple - ionization is the rescattering scenario @xcite .",
    "most of the electrons escaping from the atom when the field is strong , leave definitely and contribute to the single ionization channel . some , however , have their paths reversed back to the ionic core when the field changes sign .",
    "these electrons are then accelerated by the field and can share their energy with one or more electrons close to the nucleus .",
    "when they return to the ion , the electrons form a transient , short lived compound state which has several possible channels to decay : it can exit in a single ionization event , a double ionization event or a repetition of the rescattering cycle .",
    "interestingly , starting from this intermediate situation , a classical analysis easily yields possible pathways to ionization and the effective potential @xcite .",
    "the classical analysis of double ionization suggests that the electrons may escape simultaneously if they pass sufficiently symmetrically over saddles that form in the presence of the electric field . as the field phase changes , the saddles move along lines that keep a constant angle with respect to the polarization axis @xcite .",
    "the observation about the location of the saddles then suggested a way to reduce the degrees of freedom but to allow the possibility for the two electrons to escape with the same momentum@xcite : as in the aligned electron models , the electrons are confined to move along lines , except that the lines pass through the location of the saddles and have an angle of @xmath1 with respect to the field axis .",
    "as other 1d+1d models , also this one allows to reproduce @xcite tunnelling and rescattering processes , single and sequential double ionizations but , in addition , it allows for escape with the same momentum and hence can mimic the correlated electron escape . in the aligned  electron model",
    "this process is suppressed by the overestimated coulomb repulsion .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present the quantum version of this model and to discuss in detail its predictions for the ionization signal .",
    "results for longer pulses have been described briefly before @xcite .",
    "the model is introduced and motivated in section [ physics ] .",
    "section [ methods ] then contains technical information on numerical aspects of the calculations . except for section [ config_space ] on the methods used to distinguish the different ionization signals",
    "much of the material can be skipped on a first reading . in section [ pulses ]",
    "we focus on the results for short pulses and the temporal sequence of events . in section [ fringes ]",
    "we focus on the modulations which appear in the momentum distributions and which we related to the rescattering mechanism .",
    "we conclude with some final remarks in section [ end ] .",
    "consider a hamiltonian for a non - relativistic he atom ( in atomic units ) , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the part of hamiltonian describing the interaction with the external field .",
    "its detailed form depends on the gauge , and different forms have different advantages . for the calculation of the ionization yields",
    ", we will use the position gauge . then , for a laser pulse linearly polarized along the @xmath4 axis , @xmath3 takes the form : @xmath5 where the electric field is composed as f(t ) = f _ 0 f(t ) ( t + ) , [ pole ] with @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 being the peak amplitude , the envelope , the frequency and the initial phase , respectively . in the following we assume the frequency corresponding to the wavelength of 800  nm , i.e. @xmath10  a.u . , and the sine - squared envelope , f(t)=^2(t / t_d ) , [ envelope ] where @xmath11 is the pulse duration .",
    "the velocity gauge is more convenient for evaluation of momenta distributions : then @xmath3 reads @xmath12 with the vector potential @xmath13 .",
    "solution of the schrdinger equation corresponding to ( [ hamhe ] ) is a formidable numerical task @xcite involving six spatial dimensions . for visible or infrared frequencies it requires supercomputer resources .",
    "similar restrictions apply to s - matrix based calculations @xcite .",
    "thus simplified models that allow for reduction of the dimensionality of the problem are desirable . for single electron ionization under the influence of linearly polarized wave a 1d model where the electron is restricted to move along the field polarization axis",
    "was proposed already more than 20 years ago @xcite .",
    "such a model was shown to capture the essence of the ionization process both in microwave @xcite as well as the optical @xcite domain .",
    "a similar 1d reduction was soon applied to two electron atom @xcite .",
    "the technical advantages of such a 1d+1d electron model are numerous and the reduction appeared justified as the model seemed to capture essential features of experiments . however , the model had to be called into doubt with the advent of experiments that showed that a significant fraction of electrons leaves the atom simultaneously , in a correlated manner , with the same momenta parallel to the polarization axis .",
    "clearly , the collinear 1d+1d models overestimate the effects of the coulomb repulsion , and while they can model processes in which the electrons ionize at vastly different times , they can not capture such a simultaneous ionization event .    to overcome this shortcoming of the aligned electrons model",
    "a different reduction has been proposed in @xcite : the motion of the center of mass of the system was restricted to move along the polarization axis .",
    "this reduces the effective dimensionality of the problem from six to three spatial dimensions , and enables numerical simulations .",
    "the obvious drawback of the model is that it introduces unusual long - range correlations between the electrons which can be expected to be small when both electrons are at about the same distance from the nucleus , but which may change the dynamics when one electron is close to the nucleus and the other far away",

    "the angle of @xmath1 is chosen such they agree with the motion of the stark saddle under variation of the field.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    a model that keeps the simplicity of the aligned electron models but allows for correlated electron escape was proposed in @xcite .",
    "the model builds on the insights gained from classical trajectory studies @xcite . in the presence of the field",
    ", each electron sees an effective stark saddle . due to electron - electron repulsion",
    "the saddles move from the repulsion free positions and are placed symmetrically with respect to the polarization axis and within the same distance from the nucleus .",
    "the saddles move along straight lines when the field changes .",
    "the observation that the electrons have to cross this saddle then led to the suggestion to restrict the electronic motion to the lines traced by the saddles .",
    "the lines form angles of @xmath14 with respect to the polarization axis ( compare fig .",
    "[ geo1 ] ) .",
    "since electrons separate as they simultaneously move out from the nucleus their mutual repulsion diminishes , and the resulting potential far from the diagonal , i.e. around @xmath15 ( where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the positions along the saddle lines ) , becomes quite similar to that of the aligned electron model , as evident from the potential landscapes in fig .",

    "the model has the drawback that the chosen subspace is not an invariant subspace of the full motion , as is the case for the aligned electron model .",
    "this drawback is shared with the previously mentioned model of constrained center of mass motion @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we will see that the model does yield qualitative predictions and valuable insights into the relevant processes and interactions",
    ".    in the new `` saddle - track '' coordinates the dynamics of two electrons in the linearly polarized laser field is given by the hamiltonian @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the electron coordinates along the saddles lines .",
    "this section is mainly technical and devoted to details of the numerical procedures used in the following sections .",
    "the subjects covered in this section include the numerical method in [ technical_numerics ] , the partitioning of configuration space in [ config_space ] , the calculation of the ionization yields in [ technical_ionisation ] and the extraction of the final momentum distributions in [ technical_final ] .",
    "readers interested mainly in the physical results should read the description in section [ config_space ] of how the different ionization channels are identified in the configuration space , and may then proceed directly to the next section .",
    "the simplified 1d+1d model is applied to calculate ionization yields for single and double ionization as well as to obtain electron and ion momenta distributions .",
    "the schrdinger equation corresponding to the hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) is solved on a grid using the operator splitting method combined with the fast fourier transforms to effectively switch between the position ( appropriate for the potential ) and the momentum ( for the kinetic energy evaluation ) representations .",
    "the ionization yields are efficiently obtained in the length gauge while the velocity gauge is used for the momenta distributions . in the latter case ,",
    "the physical space is divided into different regions with coulomb repulsion neglected in the outer regions ( as explained in details below ) .",
    "the potential singularities in ( [ ham ] ) are removed by replacing @xmath19 by @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "this leads to a ground state energy of the unperturbed atom of @xmath22 ( calculated by means of the imaginary time evolution ) .    in the time evolution , in order to minimize the undesired reflections at the edges of the integration region , absorbing boundary conditions are included by adding imaginary potentials v_j=\\ {    c - i ( |r_j|-x_0)^ , |r_j|>x_0 , + 0 , ,    . where @xmath23 is the distance from the center ( along each axis ) beyond which the imaginary potential becomes active .",

    "we use @xmath29 and @xmath30 .       and",
    "* d*@xmath31 correspond to the neutral atom , and singly charged ion , and doubly charged ion populations , respectively .",
    "ionization rates are estimated from the flux across the appropriate borders , and momentum distributions are obtained by propagating the fractions of the wave functions in the corresponding singly and doubly ionized regions ( see section [ config_space ] for more details ) .",
    "[ geometry],scaledwidth=40.0% ]    for the proper assignment of the final state to the appropriate decay channel we have to identify indicators for single and double ionization .",
    "some guidance as to how to pattern configuration space is provided by the interaction potentials and the regions in which they dominate . as in many other cases ,",
    "the long range nature of the coulomb interaction calls for special care , but we will here adopt a pragmatic approach and simply classify state space by the regions in which the interaction is stronger than some threshold .",
    "this then results in the division of state space as shown in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] .",
    "we follow in this respect the original ideas developed in the belfast group @xcite . when both electrons are close to the core and interact strongly , the system is in an atomic state , so this region is labelled @xmath32 . if one electron escapes along the @xmath16-axis and the other",
    "is trapped , i.e. @xmath17 is bounded , then only the attraction of this second electron to the nucleus remains asymptotically : this defines the bands parallel to @xmath16 , which are labelled @xmath33 and @xmath34 to indicate single ionization ( in this case , of electron @xmath35 ) .",
    "similar considerations lead to the definition of @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the single ionization of electron @xmath38 .",
    "if both electrons escape , then we have double ionization , indicated by the four regions @xmath39 .",
    "the numerical values for the borders between different regions affect the quantitative predictions of the model to some extend .",
    "this is not a major problem here since anyway the restricted dimensionality model we consider yields qualitative predictions only .",
    "we take the original belfast proposition @xcite for numerical values entering the model ( indicated in fig .",
    "[ geometry ] ) .",
    "starting from a state localized near the nucleus , there are several paths to double ionization",
    ". a sufficiently strong field will open a stark saddle along the diagonal , thus enabling the electrons to pass directly from @xmath32 to @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "we call this simultaneous escape ( se ) , since both electrons move into the ionized region directly .",
    "the processes called redi for * re*collision induced * d*irect * i*onization @xcite are one example of this behaviour .",
    "other contributions could come from situations in which the doubly excited state formed during rescattering persists for a while and does not decay until a later field cycle .",
    "we can also link the different quadrants of our model with the z and nz trajectories discussed by ho et al@xcite .",
    "the z trajectories have zero or small momenta for the ion , and thus require the electrons to move in opposite directions .",
    "a z trajectory will hence end up in section @xmath42 or @xmath43 .",
    "such events are allowed , but , according to our calculations , very rare .",
    "an nz trajectory , where the momentum of the ion is non - zero , will end up in sector @xmath40 or @xmath41 .",
    "note that only the nz trajectories are influenced by the electron repulsion during their escape , and hence only they will show the momentum correlations in the final state ( according to the classical analysis in @xcite )    other paths to double ionization pass through the single ionization regions @xmath44 before entering one of the @xmath45 .",
    "such paths are then either purely independent sequential electrons escapes or reminiscent of the resi processes in longer pulses : * r*ecollision and * e*xcitation of the ion plus * s*ubsequent * i*onization @xcite .",
    "we will collect their signal under the common name : a consecutive escape ( ce ) .      with the outgoing channels",
    "properly identified , the determination of the physical observables becomes relatively easy .",
    "for instance , population of one of the states can be determined by integrating the modulus squared of the wavefunctionover a given region .",
    "e.g. the population of atoms follows from p_a = _ a ||^2 dr_1dr_2 .",
    "however , due to the fact that absorbing boundary conditions are applied , the wavefunctionleaks out of the interaction region , and the norm of the total wavefunctionand the calculated yields decrease with time .",
    "to overcome this problem , the yields are instead calculated by using the probability fluxes between appropriate regions , as suggested by dundas _",
    "the fluxes are obtained from the quantum mechanical continuity equation , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the probability density and @xmath48 is the probability current @xcite .",
    "integration of the continuity equation over a given region ( @xmath49 ) and over time gives the population of the corresponding species : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the probability flux over boundaries of the region @xmath52 .",
    "* ( dashed line ) and integration of the probability fluxes through the boundaries of the * s@xmath31 * regions ( solid line ) .",
    "absorbing boundary conditions were introduced at a distance 150 a.u . from the nucleus and a 5 cycle laser pulse with amplitude @xmath53 a.u .",
    "was used.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    fig .",
    "[ sin ] compares the population of singly charged ions as a function of time obtained applying both methods described above .",
    "the results are for a 5 cycles long laser pulse with amplitude @xmath53 . to allow the ionised ( possibly slow ) electrons to leave the vicinity of the nucleus , here and in all the other calculations the evolution",
    "is continued for one additional cycle .",
    "the absorbing boundary conditions are set at the distance of @xmath54  a.u . from the nucleus . as can be seen , as long as the electrons do not reach the absorbing boundaries both methods give the same result .",
    "then , once electrons are absorbed , there is a dramatic fall of the population calculated from the direct integration of the modulus squared wavefunctionover the * s@xmath31 * regions .",
    "however , the ionization yield calculated from the probability fluxes remains essentially flat .    to obtain the double ionization yield we calculate fluxes through the boundaries of the * d@xmath31 * regions",
    "this in turn enables us to distinguish between the direct and indirect double ionization events by calculating probability fluxes over relevant boundaries , as discussed before in section [ config_space ] .",
    "that is , one calculates the flux between regions corresponding to singly and doubly charged ions in order to get the resi ionization yield , and between regions * a * and * d@xmath31 * to get the direct double ionization yield .    to summarize :    * the population of single ions ( si ) at time @xmath55 is obtained from time integration of the fluxes from * a * to * s@xmath31 * ( @xmath56 ) minus the fluxes from * s@xmath31 * to * d@xmath57 * ; * the probabilities for simultaneous double escape ( se ) are obtained from the time integration of the fluxes * a*@xmath58*d@xmath59 * and * a*@xmath58*d@xmath60*. * a possible simultaneous , anti - correlated double ionization probability is obtained from the time integrals of the fluxes * a*@xmath58*d@xmath61 * and * a*@xmath58*d@xmath62*. * integration of fluxes from * s@xmath31 * to * d@xmath57 * ( @xmath63 ) then gives a measure of the consecutive escape ( ce ) , i.e. sequential double ionization and resi type processes .      at first glance",
    "it seems possible to obtain a distribution of electron momenta that corresponds to double ionization by calculating the fourier transform of the part of the wavefunctionlocalized in the * d@xmath31 * regions ( see fig .",
    "[ geometry ] ) , using the fact the squared modulus of the wavefunctionin the momentum representation gives a momentum distribution .",
    "however , since absorbing boundary conditions are applied , the information contained in the final wavefunctionis not complete : the faster electrons reach quickly the edges of the domain where they are absorbed , and the information about their momenta is lost .    to overcome this problem ,",
    "we use a method proposed by lein et al .",
    "it is based on the observation that beyond a certain distance from the nucleus , say @xmath64 ( in the present calculation @xmath64 is set to 200 a.u .",
    "( except for the results shown in fig",
    ".  [ intrf ] , see text ) , an electron is unlikely to return .",
    "moreover , since @xmath64 is large , the coulomb potentials are weak and the motion of the electron at that ( or an even larger ) distance is determined by the field only .",
    "therefore , for distances larger than @xmath64 , it can be assumed that the electron does not interact with the nucleus and with the other electron .",
    "such a description is reminiscent of the simple man s model @xcite that is frequently used to describe the rescattering scenario , but this analogy is only partially correct . in the simple man s model the interaction with the nucleus and the other electron",
    "is neglected directly after the tunnelling event , even when the electron is still close to the nucleus . in our case ,",
    "coulomb interactions are neglected only for distances larger than @xmath64 , where the assumption of a weak interaction is more plausible .",
    "the absence of coulomb interactions simplifies the subsequent analysis considerably .",
    "if one evolves the wavefunctionin the velocity gauge , the interaction with the laser field becomes multiplication by a phase in momentum space .",
    "that in turn gives the possibility to efficiently evolve a state in the momentum space as if the configuration space was infinite .",
    "specifically , at the beginning , when both electrons are `` close '' to the nucleus ( this region will be called @xmath65 ) , i.e. @xmath66 , the whole evolution is described by the hamiltonian corresponding to ( [ ham ] ) but in the velocity gauge : @xmath67 the wavefunction@xmath68 spreads during the course of the evolution and eventually some parts of it can enter the outside region @xmath69 , though still remaining well within the extension @xmath70 of the numerical grid .",
    "we want to project out the parts of the wavefunctionin this region and evolve them in a simplified way .",
    "this requires some care since the wavefunctionhas to be cut smoothly to minimize reflections on the boundaries .",
    "we know that this can be done using absorbing boundary conditions , so we shall use a similar approach with the difference that the `` absorbed '' part of the wavefunctionwill be further evolved in a simplified way in the outer regions , as we discuss below @xcite .    to see how the transfer between inner and outer regions is calculated , consider a wavefunction@xmath71 that may extend ( as indicated by the circle in fig .",
    "[ ir ] ) beyond the critical distance @xmath64 .",
    "it can be written as a coherent sum of four parts , namely : @xmath72    the @xmath73 part is the wavefunctionwith both electrons `` close '' to the nucleus , @xmath66 : the wavefunctionis said to be in the @xmath65 region ( dashed region in fig .",
    "[ ir ] ) ( with exponential tails in the outside region ) .",
    "this part of the wavefunctionis evolved with the full hamiltonian ( [ fullh ] ) .",
    "the @xmath74 part corresponds to the wavefunctionthat describes a situation where the first electron has crossed the border , but the other one not , i.e. @xmath75 and @xmath76 ( @xmath77 region , shaded area in fig .",
    "its evolution is governed by hamiltonian @xmath78 which neglects the coulomb interaction of the outer ( first ) electron .",
    "thanks to such a simplification , the evolution of the first electron is just a multiplication by a phase factor in the momentum space .",
    "the evolution of the other electron still includes the interaction with the nucleus .",
    "the @xmath79 part has the same meaning , but with regard to the second electron .",

    "the part @xmath86 will become the new @xmath73 function when the process of reorganizing the wavefunctionis completed .",
    "the second term is just @xmath87 and it is decomposed into three terms : ^1_in&=&\\ {    ll _ in , & for |r_1|>x_c , |r_2|<x_c + d(r_2)_in , & for |r_i|>x_c ,    .",

    "the wavefunction@xmath79 is treated similarly , with @xmath16 and @xmath17 interchanged .",
    "if the wavefunctionhas a definite parity under exchange , this can efficiently be implemented with the symmetrization @xcite .    assuming the trivial evolution for @xmath80 has also been performed we may update the wavefunction .",
    "the inner part is just replaced by @xmath86 .",

    "the wavefunctionin the outer region has only incoming contributions from all other regions .",
    "the update is , therefore , realized by the following sequence : @xmath90    this sequence is repeated in every time step and of course it is accompanied by appropriate changes of representations from position space to momentum space .",
