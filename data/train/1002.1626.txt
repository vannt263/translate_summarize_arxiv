    "collisions involving hydrogen atoms , molecules , and their positive ( h@xmath5 , h@xmath6 ) and negative ( h@xmath4 ) ions play an important role in chemistry and evolution of neutral or negatively - charged hydrogen plasma such as laboratory hydrogen plasma , the interstellar medium ( ism ) , atmospheres of the sun and other stars @xcite as well in the earth atmosphere .",
    "binary collisions of these species are simple enough to be treated using first principle methods without any adjustable parameter .",
    "therefore , such processes are often used as benchmarks for testing theoretical methods .",
    "the existence of bound states of the h@xmath0 ion in a linear configuration for the three nuclei has been suggested in 1937 @xcite , but has been questioned since then .",
    "different _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite have been giving contradictory results for the depth of the van der waals well .",
    "the estimated error bar in the calculations was comparable or larger than obtained binding energies , so the calculations could not predict for sure if the h@xmath0 ion is stable .",
    "although first observations of h@xmath0 ions have been reported in low resolution experiments as early as in 1974 @xcite , they could not warrant either the stability of h@xmath0 .",
    "it is only in the 1990 s @xcite that theory became precise enough to confirm the stability of h@xmath0 bound states .    at present , there are three available accurate potential energy surfaces ( pes ) of h@xmath0 : the pes by strck and meyer @xcite , by belyaev and tiukanov @xcite , and by panda and sathyamurthya @xcite . in the following , these three pes will be referred to as pes - sm , pes - bt , and pes - ps respectively . in addition , belyaev , tiukanov and others @xcite have obtained pes of excited electronic states of h@xmath0 and their non - born - oppenheimer couplings with the ground state .",
    "the excited electronic states are unstable with respect to electron autodetachment .",
    "bound state calculation based on the pes - sm have been performed for h@xmath0 , h@xmath7d@xmath4 , and d@xmath7h@xmath4 in ref . @xcite and using the pes - bt for h@xmath0 in ref .",
    "it is worth to mention a stand alone study by robicheaux @xcite confirming the stability of h@xmath0 ( and similar anions ) , where the pes was derived from the scattering length for the electron - h@xmath7 collisions , and from the polarizability of h@xmath7 .",
    "while never observed in the ism , the collisions between h@xmath7 and h@xmath4 , and of their isopotologues , have been studied in a number of laboratory experiments back to the 1950 s @xcite .",
    "such collisions should also play a role in processes in tokamaks , especially if the negative ion source ( d@xmath4 ) is used for the tokamak neutral beam injectors @xcite .",
    "many studies have been devoted to the calculation of elastic and inelastic cross - sections for h@xmath7-h@xmath4 collisions and for all isotopologues , @xcite , most of them for energies significantly larger than 1  ev above the lowest dissociation limit h@xmath7 + h@xmath4 . however , at such energies the theoretical cross - sections may not be reliable : the dissociation energy of the h@xmath8 ground state lies only 0.75  ev above the h@xmath0 dissociation energy , and the non - born - oppenheimer interaction between the ground states of h@xmath8 and h@xmath0 could be significant .",
    "the non - born - oppenheimer interactions have been taken into account only in ref .",
    "@xcite within a reduced - dimensionality approach , where only linear geometries of h@xmath0 have been taken into account .",
    "finally , the photodissociation of h@xmath7d@xmath4 has been studied in a simplified approach based on the franck - condon overlap between a bound level and a scattering state of h@xmath7d@xmath4 @xcite , since the _ ab initio _",
    "dipole moments of h@xmath0 were not available at that time .",
    "the present study is mainly motivated by the formation of h@xmath0 bound states in low - energy collisions between h@xmath7 and h@xmath4 . in such collisions h@xmath0 can be formed only if a third body ( other than h@xmath7 or h@xmath4 ) participates ( three - body recombination  tbr ) or if a photon is emitted ( radiative association ",
    "both processes could be relevant for the chemistry of cold interstellar clouds , if h@xmath4 is present @xcite .",
    "note that the h@xmath4 ion has not been detected so far in the interstellar medium ( ism ) : it can not be directly observed by usual photoabsorption spectroscopy because h@xmath4 has only one bound electronic state .",
    "the evaluation of the cross - section for radiative association of h@xmath7 and h@xmath4 at low energy ( 10 - 30k ) requires an accurate pes with a precision around 1 @xmath2 or better , and permanent dipole moment surfaces ( pdms ) for h@xmath0 . in the present study we calculated a new _ ab initio _",
    "pes for the h@xmath0 electronic ground state on a dense and large grid for internal coordinates , using a larger electronic basis set than those of pes - sm and pes - ps calculations .",
    "special care is taken in order to account for the long - range behavior of the surface .",
    "we also obtain for the first time the pdms of the h@xmath0 electronic ground state .",
    "we constructed fortran subroutines that calculate pes and pdms values for any arbitrary geometry using b - spline interpolation procedures , and we determine the bound states of h@xmath0 and d@xmath0 .",
