    "recently , there has been a resurgence of interest in extreme value questions for random walks and its variants , particularly in the physics literature @xcite . this is motivated to a large extent by the observation that extreme value statistics ( evs ) plays a crucial role in the physics of complex and disordered systems @xcite . although the evs of independent and identically distributed ( i.i.d .",
    ") random variables is very well understood , much less is known for strongly correlated variables , which is the case frequently encountered in physics . from that point of view , random walks offer a very useful framework where the effects of correlations on evs can be characterized analytically .",
    "the statistics of the maximal displacement of a random walk ( rw ) after a given number of steps @xmath14 is now quite well understood , thanks for instance to the pollaczeck - spitzer formula  @xcite , from which precise asymptotic estimates in the large @xmath14 limit can be obtained  @xcite .",
    "the full order statistics , i.e. the statistics of the @xmath15 maximum for any integer @xmath16 , was investigated in  @xcite in the case of ordinary rws with a narrow jump distribution ( characterized by a lvy exponent @xmath17 ) .",
    "of particular interest is the _ gap _ between two consecutive maxima , which makes it possible to characterize the `` crowding '' of the walker positions near their maximum . along this line",
    "we recently obtained a complete description of the joint distribution of the gap and time interval between the first two maxima of rws not only for narrow jump distributions ( @xmath18 ) , but also for lvy flights characterized by a lvy exponent @xmath19  @xcite .",
    "since the characteristic displacement of the walker after @xmath14 time steps grows like @xmath20 , the results of  @xcite are of interest for diffusive ( @xmath18 ) and super - diffusive ( @xmath21 ) processes only , leaving out the important case of _ sub - diffusive _ processes . extending the analysis of  @xcite to sub - diffusive rws has been one of the motivations for this work .",
    "a common model to describe sub - diffusive processes is the so called continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) . in this model ,",
    "the walker performs a usual random walk where two consecutive jumps are separated by a certain trapping time @xmath1 .",
    "the trapping times are i.i.d .",
    "random variables drawn from a common distribution @xmath4 which has a power law tail @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "this model , initially suggested by scher and montroll in the setting of non - gaussian transport in disordered electronic systems @xcite , has been widely used to describe anomalous sub - diffusive dynamics in various complex systems phenomenologically  @xcite .",
    "indeed , for @xmath24 the average trapping time between two successive jumps is infinite and , consequently , ctrws are characterized by an anomalous growth of displacement @xmath25 which is indeed sub - diffusive if @xmath7 ( and super - diffusive for @xmath8 ) .",
    "the case of a finite average trapping time between two successive jumps corresponds to standard , non sub - diffusive , rws .",
    "the fluctuations of the maximal displacement of ctrws for @xmath17 and arbitrary @xmath26 was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite using real space renormalization techniques ( see also @xcite for a feynman - kac approach )",
    ". a precise estimate of the expected value of the maximum of the ctrw was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite by combining the results of ref .",
    "@xcite with the so called subordination property. however , nothing is known about the order statistics , beyond the first maximum , for such ctrws . in this paper , we provide a complete analytic description of the distribution of the gap and the time interval between the first two maxima of such ctrws for any values of the parameters @xmath3 and @xmath27 , as well as for a finite average trapping time between two successive jumps .",
    "we consider a ctrw starting at the origin , @xmath28 , and evolving according to @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the walker position between the @xmath31-th and the @xmath32-th jumps .",
    "the jumps @xmath33 are i.i.d .",
    "random variables distributed following a symmetric , bounded and piecewise continuous distribution @xmath2 the fourier transform of which , @xmath34 , has the small @xmath16 behavior @xmath35 where @xmath3 is the lvy index and @xmath36 is the characteristic length scale of the jumps . for @xmath17 , the variance of the jump distribution @xmath37",
    "is well defined and @xmath38 . on the other hand ,",
    "for @xmath39 , @xmath2 does not possess a well defined second moment because of its heavy tails , @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) , and the rw  ( [ def_rw ] ) is a lvy flight of index @xmath42 .",
    "the time intervals @xmath43 between the @xmath44-th and the @xmath31-th jumps ( @xmath45 ) are i.i.d .",
    "random variables , independent of @xmath33 , with pdf @xmath4 the laplace transform of which , @xmath46 , has the small @xmath47 behavior @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 is the characteristic time scale of the jumps . for @xmath51 , the mean time between two successive jumps , @xmath52 , exists and @xmath53 .",
    "for @xmath27 , the mean time between two successive jumps does not exist . as a function of time ,",
    "the walker position is thus given by @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath14 the total number of jumps in the walk .",
    "the solution to  ( [ def_ctrw ] ) is readily found to be given by @xmath56 with @xmath30 given by  ( [ def_rw ] ) .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to provide an exhaustive discussion of the different behaviors of the joint pdf of the gap @xmath9 and time interval @xmath10 between the first two maxima of the walk that may arise in the large @xmath14 limit , depending on the large argument behavior of @xmath2 and @xmath4 . before entering the details of the calculations ,",
    "it is useful to summarize our main results .",
    "we first show that the joint pdf @xmath57 has a well defined limiting pdf as @xmath58 : @xmath59 where the laplace transform of @xmath60 with respect to ( w.r.t . )",
    "@xmath10 is given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq2.8 ] ) and ( [ eq2.5 ] ) .",
    "then , we perform a detailed analysis of @xmath11 in the plane @xmath61 for @xmath42 and @xmath62 in the whole ranges @xmath3 and @xmath49 , and for the three different main classes identified in  @xcite : ( i ) slow , ( ii ) exponentially , and ( iii ) fast decreasing @xmath2 at large @xmath63 .    one of the most remarkable result of this study may be the existence of a scaling form for the joint pdf @xmath11 in the case of a fast decreasing jump distribution ( @xmath18 ) , such that @xmath64 for @xmath41 [ see eq .",

    "this class includes the case of a gaussian jump distribution for which @xmath65 .",
    "this is a new result , characteristic of ctrws , without any counterpart in the discrete time rw setting considered in  @xcite .",
    "more specifically , we show that there is a scaling regime @xmath66 with fixed @xmath67 , in which @xmath11 takes the scaling form @xmath68 with the asymptotic behaviors @xmath69 where the amplitudes @xmath70 and @xmath71 are given in eqs .",
    "( [ eq5.26 ] ) and  ( [ eq5.27 ] ) , respectively .",
    "physically , the switch from the first to the second behavior  ( [ scaling1b ] ) around @xmath72 corresponds to the cross - over from a ` concentration '  or ` one - step '  regime ( for @xmath73 ) where the walker get stuck for a long time @xmath10 at the second maximum and then jumps directly to the first maximum , to a ` many - steps ' regime ( for @xmath74 ) where she / he travels a long walk of total duration @xmath10 ( with many steps ) between the second and the first maxima . for @xmath51 , there is no scaling form and  ( [ scaling1a ] ) is replaced with the uniform expression  ( [ eq5.30 ] ) .",
    "an other important result is how the scaling form derived in  @xcite for a discrete time lvy flight ( see sec .",
    "4.1 and appendix d in  @xcite ) is affected when one switches to a ctrw .",
    "lvy flights have type ( i ) jump distributions since , for @xmath39 , @xmath2 necessarily has an algebraic , slow decreasing , tail . in this case",
    "we show that in the scaling regime @xmath66 with fixed @xmath75 , the joint pdf @xmath11 takes the scaling form @xmath76 with the asymptotic behaviors @xmath77 and @xmath78 where @xmath79 in the first line of  ( [ scaling2b ] ) denotes the integer part of @xmath62 and the last two lines are for @xmath27 only .",
    "it can be checked that for @xmath51 , eqs .",
    "( [ scaling2a ] ) ,  ( [ scaling2b ] ) , and  ( [ scaling2c ] ) reduce to eqs .",
    "( 87 ) , ( 88 ) , and ( 90 ) of  @xcite in which the number of jumps between the first two maxima , @xmath80 , is merely replaced with @xmath81 , as expected from simple law of large number arguments giving @xmath82 as @xmath83 .",
    "our results provide thus a non trivial extension of the ones in  @xcite to the case @xmath27 in which the mean time between two successive jumps does not exist and law of large number arguments can not be used .",
    "finally , by integration of the joint pdf @xmath11 over @xmath9 , one finds that the marginal distribution @xmath84 displays a power law tail with logarithmic corrections and an exponent depending only on @xmath42 and @xmath62 .",
    "namely , for @xmath51 one finds @xmath85 where the amplitudes @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 are given in eq .",

    "it follows in particular from  ( [ eq1:result_p_of_t ] ) and  ( [ eq2:result_p_of_t ] ) that the first moment of @xmath84 is never defined .",

    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec2 ]",

    "the asymptotic behavior of @xmath11 for large @xmath9 is investigated in section  [ sec5 ] for three classes of jump distributions encompassing a wide range of jumps of practical interest .",
    "it is shown in section  [ sec5.3 ] that when the jump distribution has a fast decreasing tail , the behavior of @xmath60 when both @xmath9 and @xmath80 are large takes on a scaling form capturing the existence of two complementary regimes , one dominated by walks with only one step between the first two maxima , and the other dominated by walks with many steps between the first two maxima . in section  [ sec6 ] we give the scaling form of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath11 for a lvy flight at large @xmath10 and @xmath9 . in section  [ sec7 ] we use the results obtained in sections  [ sec3 ] and  [ sec6 ] to determine the large @xmath10 behavior of @xmath84 and show its freezing when the random walk is a lvy flight with index @xmath107 .",
    "finally , section  [ sec8 ] is devoted to the comparison of our analytical results with numerical simulations .",

    "the third lines of  ( [ eq1:result_p_of_t ] ) and  ( [ eq2:result_p_of_t ] ) reveal that the freezing phenomenon of the large @xmath10 behavior of @xmath84 , as a function of @xmath42 , as @xmath42 decreases past the value @xmath96 , which was first put in evidence for discrete time rws in  @xcite , also exists for ctrws . as a consequence , the first moment of @xmath84 is never defined .",
    "our study raises interesting open questions .",
    "for instance , this work focuses on the first gap and it would be interesting to study higher order gaps . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the study of the @xmath16-th gap of long random walks , for @xmath18 revealed a rich and universal behavior ( i.e. , independent of the jump distribution ) of the stationary pdf of the @xmath16-th gap in the large @xmath16 limit .",
    "the extension of these results , which also hold for ctrw with @xmath18 and any value of @xmath403 , to lvy flights , i.e. @xmath39 , remains a challenging open question .",
    "similarly , it would very interesting to study the time between the @xmath16-th and @xmath404-th maximum for ctrw ( both for @xmath405 and @xmath257 ) , for which one also expects universality for @xmath406 .",
    "finally , the generalization of our results to higher dimensions would also be very interesting ."
