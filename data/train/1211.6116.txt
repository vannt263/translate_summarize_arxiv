    "the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of a galaxy contains valuable information about its physical properties , including the stellar , gas and dust content , the age and abundance distribution of the stellar populations resulting from the star formation history ( sfh ) , and their interaction with the interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the study of the sed therefore offers the most direct way to investigate galaxy formation and evolution , both through direct observations and corresponding theoretical modelling .",
    "the different physical processes occurring in galaxies all leave their imprint on the global and detailed shape of the spectrum , each dominating at different wavelengths . therefore , by analysing and predicting the whole spectral range one can hope to deconvolve and interpret all the information contained in the sed in terms of the sfh and galaxy evolution in general .",
    "stellar sources mainly emit in the uv / optical to nir spectral range , and the sed in this wavelength region is therefore heavily influenced by the star formation history of the galaxy .",
    "the sed from a few @xmath2 m to the sub - mm ( the ir region ) is dominated by the interaction of dust grains with stellar radiation .",
    "basically dust absorbs and scatters photons , mostly at wavelength @xmath12 1 @xmath2 m and thermally emit the absorbed energy in the ir .",
    "the resulting sed is often substantially changed and in many relevant cases radically modified by the presence of dust .",
    "a detailed modelling of the entire sed of galaxies is therefore very complex .",
    "several different approaches have been proposed , depending on the purpose of the applications . some works ( e.g. devriendt , guiderdoni & sadat  1999 ; chary & elbaz 2001 ; dale et al .",
    "2001 ; dale & helou  2002 ; galliano et al .",
    "2003 ; lagache , dole & puget  2003 ; burgarella et al .",
    "2005 , da cunha , charlot & elbaz  2008 ) have proposed semi - empirical treatments of the seds .",
    "the aim of these works is in general to interpret large samples of data , requiring fast computing times making use of observationally or physically motivated seds .",
    "there are then other codes , as hyperz ( bolzonella et al .",
    "2000 ) or lephare ( arnouts et al .",
    "1999 ) which usually perform a template - based sed fitting procedure based on a standard @xmath13 minimization method . usually here",
    "dust effects are accounted for by computing the attenuation of the light from a source placed behind a foreground screen of dust and assuming different extinction curves .",
    "other works are based , instead , on theoretical computations in order to have a more general applicability in terms of interpretative and predictive power .",
    "several papers deal with the radiative transfer ( rt ) in spherical geometries , mainly aimed at modelling starburst galaxies ( e.g. rowan - robinson  1980 ; rowan - robinson & crawford  1989 ; efstathiou , rowan - robinson & siebenmorgen  2000 ; popescu et al .",
    "2000 ; efstathiou & rowan - robinson  2003 ; takagi , arimoto & hanami  2003a ; takagi , vansevicius & arimoto  2003b ; siebenmorgen & krugel  2007 ; rowan - robinson 2012 ) .",
    "early models of this kind did not include the evolution of stellar populations .",
    "silva et al .  (",
    "1998 ) were the first to couple radiative transfer through a dusty ism and the spectral ( and chemical ) evolution of stellar populations .",
    "modelling the emission from stars and dust consistently in order to get reliable estimates for the main galaxy physical parameters , like stellar mass ( @xmath14 ) , star formation rate ( sfr ) and the average extinction ( @xmath15 ) , involves solving the radiative transfer equation for idealised but realistic geometrical distributions of stars and dust , as well as taking advantage of the full sed coverage from uv to sub - mm .",
    "the full sed allows the total luminosity of the galaxy to be robustly constrained without relying on extrapolations based on optical data alone .",
    "while the shape of the optical - uv sed indicates some level of dust extinction , there may be stellar populations ( typically the newly born ) completely obscured by dust .",
    "the only way to overcome this problem and quantify how much stellar light ( and therefore mass ) is missing from the optical , is to consider the dust - absorbed galaxy luminosity through the dust re - emitted spectrum in the ir , and model it together with the optical spectrum with a complete radiative transfer method .    with total infrared luminosities between @xmath16 l@xmath5 and @xmath17 l@xmath5 ,",
    "respectively , luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies [ ( u)lirgs hereafter ] are among the most luminous and complex extragalactic objects we can conceive , including all varieties of young and old stellar populations , dust absorption , scattering , grain thermal re - radiation , and agn emission ( lonsdale et al .",
    "although they are quite rare in the local universe , they dominate the cosmic star formation rate and the fir background at z @xmath18 1 .",
    "therefore they are suitable laboratories to study the main physical processes which drive galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "observations of local ulirgs have shown that they are dominated by strong interactions and mergers and the fraction of mergers / interactions among them has been found to be strongly correlated with their ir luminosity , such that lower luminosity lirgs ( l@xmath19 @xmath20 @xmath21 l@xmath5 ) are ordinary disks while the highest luminosity ulirgs are advanced stage mergers .",
    "high - z lirgs and ulirgs seem to be , instead , not equivalents of ulirgs in the nearby universe , but rather upscaled versions of normal galaxies ( elbaz et al .",
    "2011 ; nordon et al . 2012 ; symeonidis et al .",
    "2009 ; rujopakarn et al .",
    "an implication is that high - z ulirgs could well have gradually evolving sfhs , and be not necessarily associated with merger events as they are at z@xmath00 .",
    "this paper is the first of a series dedicated to a detailed physical investigation of the spectro - photometric properties of dusty high - redshift ( u)lirgs in an attempt to achieve a deeper understanding of these sources .",
    "here we concentrate on a small sample of high-@xmath22 ( u)lirgs with the currently richest suite of photometric and spectroscopic data , available for the first time at redshift @xmath11 , combining deep _ herschel _ imaging with ultra - deep irs spectra from _",

    "[ data ] we describe our data sample .",
    "the physical modeling performed for this study is presented in section  [ grasilandfadda ] .",
    "the results concerning our sfh and sfr estimates are discussed in section  [ sfrandsfh ] . while the predicted stellar masses and average extinctions for these high - z ( u)lirgs are presented in section  [ massdet ] .",
    "the conclusions can be found in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "our cosmological model assumes h@xmath23=71 km @xmath24 mpc@xmath25 , @xmath26=0.73 , @xmath27=0.27 .",
    "our high-@xmath22 ( u)lirgs have been selected from the sample of 48 ir - luminous galaxies in goods - s presented by fadda et al .",
    "( 2010 , f10 hereafter ) .",
    "it includes the faintest @xmath1 @xmath2 m sources observed with irs ( @xmath28 mjy ) in the two redshift bins ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) and samples the major contributors to the cosmic infrared background at the most active epochs . at these redshifts , the @xmath31",
    "m fluxes translate to infrared luminosities roughly in the ranges for lirgs at @xmath10 and ulirgs at @xmath11 .",
    "this sample is therefore crudely luminosity selected ( with the @xmath32 limits corresponding to different luminosity ranges for the z@xmath33 lirgs and z@xmath34 ulirgs ) and f10 did not apply any other selections .",
    "these objects have been selected by f10 mostly using the photometric redshifts computed by caputi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) since only 50% and 10% of them had spectroscopic - z in the z@xmath0 1 and 2 bins , respectively .",
    "as emphasized by f10 , except for having higher dust obscuration , these galaxies do not have extremely deviant properties in the rest - frame uv / optical compared to galaxies selected at observed optical / near - ir band .",
    "their observed optical / near - ir colors are very similar to those of extremely red galaxy ( erg ) populations selected by large area k - band surveys .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on galaxies powered by star formation .",
    "therefore we excluded from our present analysis objects previously classified by f10 as agn - dominated on the basis of several indicators such as broad and high ionization lines in optical spectra , lack of a @xmath35 m stellar bump in the sed , x - ray bright sources , low mid - ir @xmath36 m ew and optical morphology ( see also pozzi et al .",
    "we also excluded the sources falling outside the multiwavelength music catalogue ( santini et al .",

    "2010 ) and daddi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) . our upper and lower envelopes in fig .",
    "3 , within which all our sources are contained , may correspond to these two sequences .",
    "further investigation with larger and unbiased samples of galaxies will help in this sense .",
    "the latter would be explained by the fact that , while locally galaxies with ir luminosities exceeding @xmath47 l@xmath5 are predominantly associated with merging events ( e.g. dasyra et al .",
    "2006 ) , at high - z these high - ir luminosities may be achieved mostly via cold gas accretion ( powell et al . 2011 ) .",
    "our study confirms that high - z ( u)lirgs are more likely up - scaled versions of normal galaxies rather than equivalents of local ( u)lirgs in terms of the mode of sf ( e.g. symeonidis et al . 2009 , rujopakarn et al . 2011 ) .    with our current assumptions ( see    [ grasilandfadda ] ) , all our mid - ir selected galaxies appear to include massive populations of old ( @xmath3  gyr ) stars and , at the same time , to host a moderate ongoing activity of sf ( sfr@xmath43 @xmath4 100  m@xmath5/yr , cf .",
    "[ sfrchih ] ( right ) ) . the bulk of stars appear to have been formed a few gyr before the observation in essentially all cases .",
    "average estimates can be inferred from fig  [ sfrtm ] : for the z@xmath0 2 ( u)lirgs having the sfh shown in the central panel of fig .  [ sfrtm ] , about 66 - 80% of the stellar mass has formed after @xmath0 1 gyr from the beginning of their star formation activity , proportionally higher at higher sf efficiency . for the z@xmath02 ( u)lirgs presenting , instead , more regular sfh , as those shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ sfrchih ] , about 30 - 43% of stellar mass is formed after 1 gyr . finally for the lirgs , on average , @xmath0 28% of the stellar mass has already been formed after the first 1 gyr .",
    "another key physical parameter of high - redshift galaxies is the stellar mass m@xmath48 .",
    "our best - fit estimates appear in table  [ tabulirg ] where we compare our best - fit m@xmath48 to those derived by f10 .",
    "they fit bc03 models to the optical - to-8 @xmath2 m sed with the hyperz code ( bolzonella et al .",
    "2000 ) allowing different sfhs , from a constant star formation to an exponentially declining sf with different e - folding times ( @xmath49-model ) , and assuming the calzetti et al .",
    "( 2000 ) attenuation law to account for dust extinction effects .",
    "the so called @xmath49-model is essentially an analytical approximation of the schmidt s law @xmath50 , with @xmath49=1/@xmath51 . as shown in tab .",
    "[ tabulirg ] , grasil m@xmath48 are systematically larger than those based on hyperz .",
    "this discrepancy is higher for the ulirgs at @xmath11 , for which it reaches a factor of @xmath0 @xmath52 in m@xmath48 ( median factor 2.5 ) , while it is lower for the @xmath10 lirgs whose median factor is @xmath53 .",
    "michalowski et al .",
    "( 2012 , m12 hereafter ) found the adopted specific sfh ( double component versus @xmath49-model ) to be the major factor affecting the derived stellar masses of high-@xmath22 and highly star forming smgs , accounting for a factor of @xmath0 2.5 in m@xmath48 .",
    "we have investigated the possible origin of the larger differences in our m@xmath48 estimates by considering different models for the sfh , continuous vs starburst . in both cases we found similar m@xmath48 discrepancies with respect to the hyperz ones . as discussed in detail in m12",
    ", the different evoutionary models may also contribute to a factor 2.5 difference in m@xmath48 estimates when a @xmath49-model is considered .",
    "we tested this hypothesis by modeling our ( u)lirgs with similar sfhs ( tau - models ) , age , metallicity and @xmath54 plus calzetti attenuation law and by fitting the optical data alone as in the hyperz code . by adopting similar prescriptions we found our m@xmath48 to be in full agreement , ( i.e. within @xmath55 ) with the hyperz estimates .",
    "taking into account the differences in the specific parameters ruling the sfh ( e.g.  @xmath49 ) and on the ssp libraries used ( bc03 and grasil ssps rely on the same padova isochrones but the latter includes dusty envelopes around agb stars ) we can conclude that the different sfh ( i.e. different @xmath49 ) and ssps can not account for the larger discrepancies , we find among the more obscured ulirgs at @xmath11 ; for these the dominant factor is the dust exinction .",
    "of course the effect of the different sfh on the stellar mass estimates becomes larger when comparing @xmath49-models with sfh characterized by recent ( last 50 myr ) burst of star formation , as shown by m12 .",
    "all these galaxies are , however , normal star forming galaxies and the only five objects requiring the burst on top of the schimdt - type sf are all observed as late - sbs .      using the grasil best - fits",
    ", we estimate the average total extinction in the rest - frame @xmath56-band , @xmath54 , from the ratio of the extinguished ( @xmath57 ) to the unextinguished starlight ( @xmath58 ) : @xmath59 the average a@xmath60 values , reported in table [ tabulirg ] , are systematically higher for the @xmath11 than for the @xmath10 objects .",
    "these differences are traceable to the different evolutionary stages at which the two classes of sources are observed .",
    "our best - fit a@xmath60 are also systematically higher than those obtained with hyperz using the calzetti approximation in combination with the foreground screen of dust , expecially for the @xmath11 ulirgs for which the median a@xmath61 is @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the two cases , respectively .    as shown in fig .",

    "this clarifies why for ulirgs , with higher a@xmath61 on average , we see the largest stellar mass discrepancies .",
    "the stellar mass missed by fitting optical data alone is hidden in dust . in concurrence with our results , wuyts et al .",
    "( 2009 ) also found that the mass underestimate is more severe during the dusty , peak sf phase .",
    "it is worth noting that the availability of the full wavelength coverage also plays a crucial role in constraining the models .",
    "in fact the first basic constraint that is provided by the availability of uv - to - sub - mm data is the total l@xmath66 of the galaxy , which otherwise should be guessed .",
    "this is easier when the optical contains most of the total energy .",
    "the shape of the optical - uv sed indicates some level of dust , but there may be stellar populations totally obscured by dust ( typically the newly born ) , and even less young stellar populations may be partly extinguished . without a constraint on the optical - uv extinction , i.e. on",
    "how much is re - emitted in the ir , it is difficult to quantify how much stellar light ( therefore mass ) is missing from the optical .",
    "two examples are given in fig .",
    "[ balance ] which compares the total l@xmath66 inferred from the unextinguished starlight component computed with hyperz ( in red ) to that one computed with grasil ( magenta long - dashed line ) and to the total l@xmath19 inferred from the grasil best - fits .",
    "the two objects shown in this figure represent two extreme cases , the one on the left corresponding to a large discrepancy in stellar mass ( @xmath0 a factor of 4 ) and the other one on the right characterized by the lowest stellar mass discrepancy ( @xmath0 a factor of 1.17 ) . of course , due to energy balance , the energy of the pure stellar sed must be equal to that of the processed sed which fit the data .",
    "therefore , the ir part of the sed is a further fundamental constraint when it contains an important fraction of the energy emitted by stellar populations .",
    "figure  [ extinction ] ( bottom ) shows that our stellar and dust masses are consistent with published estimates for high-@xmath22 smgs at comparable redshifts .",
    "compared to local spirals and local ( u)lirgs our @xmath11 ( u)lirgs have higher dust - to - stellar mass ratios , by a factor of @xmath0 30 and 6 , respectively .",
    "similar results were found by santini et al .",
    "2010 for the high-@xmath22 smgs .",
    "the m@xmath67/m@xmath48 of z@xmath33 lirgs are , instead , similar to those of local ( u)lirgs .",
    "m@xmath48 and m@xmath67 of galaxies in this work appear also to be in agreement with the predictions of the calura et al .  ( 2008 ) chemical evolution models for proto - ellipticals .",
    "the distribution of our sources in this plot is also similar to that found by rowan - robinson et al .",
    "2010 for the hermes lockman sample .",
    "these specific aspects will be dealt with in detail in one of the forthcoming papers of the series .",
    "the top - right panel of fig .",
    "[ extinction ] illustrates the possible degeneracy in the model solutions , between the average extinction and stellar mass , color - coded by the value of @xmath13 , for a typical @xmath11 ulirg .",
    "as we see , among the many solutions considered , acceptable best - fits , within @xmath68 + 30 , are clearly identified in the parameter space and not much degeneracy is apparent . in particular a@xmath60 and m@xmath48",
    "seem to be well constrained within @xmath69 @xmath70 and @xmath71 @xmath72 dex .",
    "these values refer to the case of fixed sfh , that is to say fixed @xmath73 and @xmath51 .",
    "if we consider in addition to the many combinations of grasil parameters also the different combinations of parameters ruling the sfh , the scatter around the best - fit solution increases to @xmath69 @xmath74 and @xmath71 @xmath75 dex , well within the typical uncertainties for this kind of analysis .",
    "this is likely to be a result of the continuous spectral coverage from uv to sub - mm for our sample .",
    "another likely factor is the self - consistent radiative transfer modelling , accounting for the distribution of dust with respect to young and old stars , from which both the age - dependent dust attenuation and dust reprocessing are constrained .",
    "the present work reports on a selection of results from a physical self - consistent study of ir luminous galaxies at @xmath76 and @xmath77 . for this study we combined far - infrared photometry from two related deep surveys , pep and hermes , carried out with the _ herschel space observatory _ , with deep photometry in the near - ir and mid - ir with the _ spitzer _ irac and mips imagers , as well as complete mid - infrared spectroscopic follow - up with the _ spitzer _ s infrared spectrograph irs .",

    "herschel_.    these data have prompted us to investigate the nature and the main physical properties - like stellar mass , bolometric luminosity , star - formation history , extinction , as well as the mass assembly history - for every object .",
    "the novelty of our approach consists in modeling the data with a self - consistent physical code ( grasil ) , exploiting a state - of - the - art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing .",
    "we find that all of our galaxies require massive populations of old ( @xmath3  gyr ) stars and , at the same time , host a moderate ongoing activity of sf ( sfr@xmath78 100  m@xmath5/yr with sfr@xmath43 being the sfr averaged over the last 10 myr ) .",
    "our detailed analysis appears to give important hints also on the past history of sf with the bulk of stars consistent with having been formed a few gyr before the observation in essentially all cases .",
    "only five galaxies of the sample seem to require , on the basis of an application of the @xmath79-test to our @xmath13 analysis , a recent starburst superimposed on a low - level , secularly evolving star formation history . even in these five objects , however , the gas mass involved in the sb amounts to only a small fraction of the galactic mass , @xmath20 4% , and all of them are observed just at the end of the burst event ( i.e. late sbs ) .",
    "we find substantial discrepancies between our results and those based on optical - only sed fitting for the same objects .",
    "our physically consistent best - fit model solutions of the observed seds indicate higher extinctions ( by @xmath6a@xmath7 0.81 and 1.14 ) and higher stellar masses ( by @xmath6log(m@xmath8 0.16 and 0.36 dex ) for z@xmath01 and z@xmath02 ( u)lirgs , respectively . the stellar mass difference is larger for the most obscured objects and correlates with the total dust extinction .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of wuyts et al .",

    "we also find lower sfrs on average than those computed from the total @xmath9 using the kennicutt ( 1998 ) calibration due to the significant contribution to the dust heating by intermediate - age stellar populations through ` cirrus ' emission : only @xmath027% and @xmath034% of the total @xmath9 appears to be due to ongoing sf in mcs for @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( u)lirgs , respectively .",

    "<S> we model the data with a self - consistent physical model ( grasil ) which includes a state - of - the - art treatment of dust extinction and reprocessing . </S>",
    "<S> we find that all of our galaxies appear to require massive populations of old ( @xmath3  gyr ) stars and , at the same time , to host a moderate ongoing activity of sf ( sfr @xmath4 100  m@xmath5/yr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk of the stars appear to have been formed a few gyr before the observation in essentially all cases . </S>",
    "<S> only five galaxies of the sample require a recent starburst superimposed on a quiescent star formation history ( sfh ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also find discrepancies between our results and those based on optical - only sed fitting for the same objects ; by fitting their observed spectral energy distributions with our physical model we find higher extinctions ( by @xmath6a@xmath7 0.81 and 1.14 ) and higher stellar masses ( by @xmath6log(m@xmath8 0.16 and 0.36 dex ) for z@xmath01 and z@xmath02 ( u)lirgs , respectively . the stellar mass difference is larger for the most dust obscured objects . </S>",
    "<S> we also find lower sfrs than those computed from @xmath9 using the kennicutt relation due to the significant contribution to the dust heating by intermediate - age stellar populations through ` cirrus ' emission ( @xmath073% and @xmath066% of total @xmath9 for @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( u)lirgs , respectively ) . </S>"
