    "@xcite first showed that even on very large scales , the galaxy power spectrum in redshift space is significantly affected by bulk flows , and proposed this as a technique to measure @xmath1 .",
    "the anisotropy of the correlation function was explored by @xcite .",
    "the redshift - space distorition technique was first applied to the _ infrared astronomical satellite _ ( _ iras _ ) 2 jy redshift survey by @xcite , yielding a measurement of @xmath2 .",
    "subsequent work with _",
    "iras_-selected surveys @xcite and optically - selected redshift surveys @xcite showed that the redshift - space anisotropy parameter @xmath3 was @xmath4 , providing strong evidence that either @xmath5 or a high bias @xmath6 was required .",
    "the 2-degree field ( 2df ) survey represented a large step forward for redshift space distortion measurements , with @xcite reporting @xmath7 . combining this approach with the galaxy bispectrum , which independently gives @xmath8 , allowed @xcite to measure @xmath9 , completely internal to the 2df survey .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) has reported rsd measurements from both magnitude - limited and color - selected ( luminous red galaxy ; lrg ) samples @xcite .",
    "rsd measurements have also been reported for quasars @xcite and more recently ( and with higher signal - to - noise ratio ) for galaxies at @xmath10 @xcite .        today , other methods of constraining @xmath11 are more powerful , namely combining the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) with supernovae and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) measurements @xcite .",
    "rsds have also developed a reputation for having difficult - to - control systematics since nonlinear evolution affects them at larger scales than the real space power spectrum .",
    "however , the discovery of dark energy has driven a revival in the subject of redshift space distortions .",
    "the same jumbo redshift surveys that are required by the bao method will measure many modes of the galaxy field at large scales ",
    "precisely what is required to exploit the power of the redshift - space distortion technique in the regime where its systematics should be minimized @xcite .",
    "modified gravity theories in which the acceleration of the universe reflects a breakdown of general relativity rather than a new contribution to the cosmic energy budget have motivated studies of the growth of structure , as it is impossible to distinguish these models from dark energy using distance information alone ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this case",
    "redshift - space distortions generally measure the velocity power spectrum @xmath12 .",
    "finally , advances in understanding nonlinear evolution with larger @xmath13-body simulations and with halo occupation models @xcite , and novel techniques using multiple galaxy tracers to reduce the uncertainty on @xmath12 @xcite have made the case for rsds more compelling .",
    "indeed , rsds are part of the prime science case of the proposed _ euclid _ dark energy mission .",
    "rsds suffer from a very different set of limitations than alternative probes of the growth of cosmic structure such as cosmic shear ( cs ) , the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect , and the cluster mass function .",
    "cs directly probes the matter distribution without assumptions about galaxy biasing ; it is however technically difficult to measure galaxy shapes with sufficient control of systematics , and practical implementations of cs rely on photometric redshifts .",
    "the isw effect has turned out to be relatively clean @xcite , but its statistical power suffers from severe cosmic variance limitations .",
    "clusters are easier to observe than cs , and are numerous so that statistical errors can be made small even with present data ; the main uncertainty is instead in the astrophysics of relating cluster observables to virial masses .",
    "the most worrying systematic error in the rsd method is the behaviour of galaxy biasing and velocities in the nonlinear regime .",
    "however , we show in this paper that the alignment of galaxies by large - scale tidal fields results in an additional systematic error . if galaxies are preferentially aligned along the stretching axis of the tidal field , as is the case for lrgs , and there is any viewing direction - dependent selection effect ( e.g. preferring galaxies where we look down the long axis , as would occur with an aperture magnitude cut ) , then fourier modes of the density field along the line of sight are suppressed because the galaxies in the troughs are more likely to be selected than galaxies in the crests .",
    "this is shown in cartoon form in fig .",
    "[ fig : cartoon ] . tidal alignments of disk galaxies would if present produce a similar effect because these galaxies are often selected by optical continuum or emission line luminosity cuts , which suffer inclination - dependent internal extinction . the alignment effect is small  we will argue that in pessimistic scenarios it contaminates redshift space distortion measurements by 510 per cent  but we will show that it exactly mimics the angular and scale dependence of rsds , making it hard to remove . moreover , it is not included in mock catalogues that paint galaxies onto @xmath13-body simulations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : zspace ] , we outline the standard theory of the rsd technique . in section  [ sec : problem ] , we show how they can be altered by galaxies with tidal alignments and viewing direction - dependent selection effects .",
    "section  [ sec : t ] specializes to the physically motivated case of galaxies aligned by the large - scale tidal field . in section  [ sec : micro ]",
    "we consider some crude models of orientation - dependent selection effects and find that they may be significant .",
    "section  [ sec : cosmic ] compares the effects of tidal alignments on rsd to their more familiar effect on cs .",
    "we conclude and discuss mitigation strategies in section  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the early parts of this paper , especially section  [ sec : problem ] , are intended to be general , exploring all models allowed by symmetry ; they are unavoidably heavy on mathematical formalism . section  [ sec : micro ] , in contrast",

    "section  [ sec : cosmic ] is included mainly to develop intuition and hence also makes use of some rough calculations .",

    "we work in the flat - sky approximation and take the observer s line of sight to be in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "the bulk velocity field is described in linear perturbation theory by @xmath19 for a sample of galaxies with linear bias @xmath8 , the real - space density fluctuation of galaxies in the linear regime is @xmath20 .",

    "that is , @xmath22 these equations are most easily represented in fourier space : @xmath23 and @xmath24    the overall galaxy density in redshift space is then @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the direction of the fourier mode under consideration .",
    "this implies an observed galaxy power spectrum , @xmath27 the amount of anisotropy depends on the parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the standard use of redshift space distortions is to use the amplitudes @xmath29 , which satisfy @xmath30 to extract the quantity @xmath31 .",

    "this could be done internally to the galaxies using the @xcite test . in this case , extracting @xmath41 would require independent information on the galaxy bias , e.g. from the three - point function .",

    "it would be premature at present to conclude that one of these strategies will be more successful than the other .",
    "moreover , since cs and rsd do not measure the same function ( cs measures @xmath15 whereas rsd measures @xmath400 ) they are not necessarily competitors .",
    "in this paper , we showed that tidal alignments of galaxies can be a source of systematic error for the redshift - space distortion technique to measure the growth of cosmic structures .",

    "realistic models would probably give smaller contamination , since the tidal alignment effect decreases as one goes down the lrg luminosity function and our result for disk galaxies uses an upper limit .",
    "the effect is probably unimportant for current rsd measurements , but could represent a problem for future large - scale structure surveys .",
    "there are several strategies to reduce contamination of the rsd by tidal alignments .",
    "one could choose samples of galaxies with weaker alignments ; in lrg surveys this means going to fainter galaxies , whereas for late - type galaxies we do not have a detection of tidal alignments so no specific subsample can be identified as `` best '' at this time .",
    "secondly , one could try to reduce anisotropic selection effects ; for optically thin galaxies such as ( most ) lrgs , this would mean using model magnitudes for selection .",
    "for late - type galaxies whose optical luminosities are significantly affected by dust this is harder , but to some extent is possible ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "a final strategy would be to take observed density - ellipticity correlation functions and attempt a model - dependent calculation of the @xmath126 parameter by methods similar to those used in this paper ( but more sophisticated ) .    in this paper",
    "we have focused our attention on the effect of tidal alignments in the linear regime .",
    "the same processes occur in the quasilinear and nonlinear regimes , although there it is even more difficult to make predictions .",
