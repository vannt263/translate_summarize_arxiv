    "it is a widely held belief that new physics must exist beyond that predicted by the standard model(sm ) if for no other reason than that it leaves us with too many unanswered questions and too many free parameters .",
    "just when , where and how new physics will make its first appearance has been  and continues to be  a matter of some speculation . in the past few years we have seen a number of potential new physics signatures vanish as either more statistics was accumulated or the data and analysis thereof improved .",
    "these signatures have each in their turn induced some excitement in the community with the hope that a new window beyond the sm was finally opening .",
    "though later vanishing , these affects have each taught us something new about what kinds of models can be constructed , even if they were not necessarily realized in nature , given the ever - tightening constraints provided by experiment . still , new physics is out there somewhere waiting to be discovered ; it is only a question of looking",
    ". we should learn to expect the unexpected .",
    "searching for new physics is a multi - pronged attack on the unknown . while the production of a non - sm particle at a collider would be the most obvious and undeniable signature that one can imagine , the first sign of something new maybe more subtle .",
    "for example , one can imagine a significant deviation from sm expectations in a precision measurement , , the @xmath3 mass or polarized forward - backward asymmetry for @xmath4quarks , @xmath5 .",
    "instead , one might imagine the observation of a process forbidden by the sm , such as @xmath6 .",
    "however , as is well known , new physics rarely contributes to only one of these scenarios .",
    "for example , susy leads to new particle production at colliders , a potentially observable shift in the @xmath3 mass and/or @xmath7 and can enhance many rare decay processes beyond their sm expectations .",
    "the same is of course true with other forms of new physics .",
    "in fact , it likely that once new physics is found all three types of experiments will be necessary to unravel its detailed nature .",
    "attempts to understand the excess of events at high@xmath0 recently observed at hera in both the neutral current(nc ) and charged current(cc ) channels@xcite provides just such an example of the strong interplay between the various new physics search scenarios and the constraints that arise from the three classes of experiments .",
    "if the hera excesses are real and non - resonant then possible explanations include , , the presence of higher dimensional operators@xcite signalling compositeness or exotic modifications in the parton densities at large @xmath8@xcite ; both these proposed scenarios face some very serious difficulties . instead , if the excess is resonant a popular@xcite explanation is the @xmath9channel production of a @xmath10 gev scalar ( , spin-0 ) leptoquark(lq ) with fermion number(@xmath11 ) equal to zero  the subject of the present work .",
    "( given the most recent results@xcite it appears that the h1 excess in the nc channel is apparently clustered at @xmath12 gev while that for zeus is at @xmath13 gev . whether this is reconcilable with a single resonance is still unknown . )",

    "any discussion of lq models has been historically based on the classic work by buchm \" uller , r \" uckl and wyler(brw)@xcite .",
    "those authors provided not only a set of assumptions under which consistent lq models can be constructed but then classified them according to their possible spins and fermion number thus leading to the 10 states displayed in table 1 .",
    "these assumptions may be stated as follows :    \\(a ) lq couplings must be invariant with respect to the sm gauge interactions    \\(b ) lq interactions must be renormalizable    \\(c ) lqs couple to only a single generation of sm fermions    \\(d ) lq couplings to fermions are chiral    \\(e ) lq couplings separately conserve baryon and lepton numbers    \\(f ) lqs only couple to the sm fermions and gauge bosons    l|ccrccc & leptoquark    ' '' ''    & su(5 ) rep & & @xmath14 & coupling & @xmath15 + scalars & & & & & & + @xmath16    ' '' ''    & @xmath17 & * 5 * & & @xmath18 & @xmath19 , @xmath20 & @xmath21 + & @xmath22 & * 5 * & & @xmath18 & @xmath23 & 1 + & @xmath24 & * 45 * & & @xmath25 & @xmath26 & 1 + & & & & @xmath25 & @xmath27 & 1 + & @xmath28 & * 45 * & @xmath29 & @xmath18 & @xmath30 , @xmath31 & @xmath21 + & & & & @xmath32 & @xmath33 & 0 + [ 0pt]@xmath34 & [ 0pt]@xmath35 & [ 0pt]*45 * & [ 0pt]@xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath38 & 1 + & & & & @xmath39 & @xmath40 & 0 + & [ 0pt]@xmath41 & [ 0pt]*45 * & [ 0pt]@xmath36 & @xmath37 & @xmath42 & 1 + & & & & @xmath39 & @xmath43 & 1 + & [ 0pt]@xmath44 & [ 0pt]*10/15 * & [ 0pt]@xmath36 & @xmath39 & @xmath45 & 1 + & & & & @xmath46 & @xmath47 & 0 + vectors & & & & & +    ' '' ''    [ 0pt]@xmath16 & [ 0pt]@xmath48 & [ 0pt]*24 * & [ 0pt]@xmath36 & @xmath25 & @xmath49 & 1 + & & & & @xmath18 & @xmath20 & 0 + & [ 0pt]@xmath50 & [ 0pt]*24 * & [ 0pt]@xmath36 & @xmath25 & @xmath26 & 1 + & & & & @xmath18 & @xmath23 & 1 + & [ 0pt]@xmath51 & [ 0pt]*10/15 * & [ 0pt]@xmath36 & @xmath18 & @xmath19 & 1 + & & & & @xmath32 & @xmath52 & 0 + @xmath34 & @xmath53 & * 10 * & & @xmath39 & @xmath45 , @xmath40 & @xmath21 + & @xmath54 & * 10 * & & @xmath39 & @xmath26 & 1 + & @xmath55 & * 75 * & & @xmath37 & @xmath42 & 1 + & & & & @xmath37 & @xmath56 & 1 + & @xmath57 & * 40 * & @xmath29 & @xmath39 & @xmath58 , @xmath40 & @xmath21 + & & & & @xmath46 & @xmath59 & 0 +    if we strictly adhere to these rules then the requirements of gauge invariance and renormalizability fix all of the spin-1 lq couplings and thus its production cross section at the tevatron@xcite is simply a function of its mass . the possibility that such particles can exist in the mass range below approximately 350 gev can then be excluded based on the direct searches by both cdf and d0@xcite .",
    "( as noted by blmlein@xcite , the introduction of non - renormalizable anomalous couplings for the lq may allow us to somewhat soften this conclusion but spin-1 lqs are still found to be excluded in the range of interest for the hera excess . )",
    "if the lq is a scalar but is of the @xmath60 type then we would have expected to see an event excess show up in the @xmath61 nc channel and not the @xmath62 channel as is the case .",
    "this is demonstrated in table 2 which shows the event rate for each of the brw scalar lqs assuming a yukawa coupling strength of @xmath63 and a mass of 200 gev normalized to a luminosity of 100 @xmath64 .",
    "even with the great disparity in integrated luminosity collected by the experiments in both channels and allowing for the free adjustment of the strength of the yukawa coupling we must conclude that the lq is of the @xmath34 type .",
    "we note from table 1 that all @xmath34 scalar lqs must have @xmath65 and lie in @xmath66 doublets , implying that more than one type of lq must exist .",
    "given the recent strengthening of the tevatron search reach and the possible cc excess at hera , this poses a serious challenge to the scalar lq interpretation , although not as serious as was found in the case of vector lqs .",
    "using the next - to - leading order cross section formulae of krmer , the @xmath67 cl lower limit on the mass of a @xmath65 scalar lq is found by d0 to be 225 gev .",
    "d0 has also performed a combined search for first generation leptoquarks by using the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 channels . for fixed values of the leptoquark mass below 225 gev",
    ", these search constraints can be used to place an upper limit on @xmath15 . for @xmath71=200(210,220 ) gev , d0 obtains the constraints @xmath72 at @xmath67 cl .",
    "of course if cdf and d0 combine their searches in the future , then the 225 gev bound may rise to @xmath73 gev , in which case even stronger upper bounds on @xmath15 will be obtained .",
    "allowing the lq to have decays into the @xmath74 final state with a reasonable branching fraction would solve this problem and would yield the desired cc signal at hera .",
    "however the models in table 1 do not allow for this possibility .",

    "to directly test the proposed models we must look for new physics signatures _ beyond _ those suggested by the lq interactions described eqns . 1 and 2 .",
    "one possibility is to probe for the additional interactions between the vlfs and the lq ; this is obviously difficult since the vlfs are so massive .",
    "a second possibility is to directly look for the influences of the vlfs themselves . for the time",
    "being this must be an indirect search since the lhc will be required to directly produce the vlfs in the range of interest to us here . once the lhc is available , however , a 1 tev color triplet will produce 1000 events / yr even with a luminosity of 10 @xmath81 .    in the first category a potential new process of interest is the pair production of like sign lqs at the tevatron through @xmath82 and @xmath83channel @xmath84 exchange ( in those models where it is present ) when @xmath84 is a majorana field : @xmath85 .",
    "this rate for this process goes as the fourth power of the @xmath86 or @xmath87 yukawa coupling but these are assumed to be of order unity so that potentially large cross sections are obtainable .",
    "one finds the subprocess cross section to be @xmath88 ^ 2\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the mass of the @xmath84 .",
    "note that as @xmath90 the rate vanishes as one might expect for a majorana fermion induced process .",
    "the cross section for this reaction at the tevatron main injector for @xmath91 and @xmath92 gev is approximately 50 fb for @xmath89=1 tev and falls off quickly with increasing as @xmath89 increases .",
    "since the signature for this process is 2 jets plus like - sign leptons there is little sm backgrounds and so it may be observable during run ii .",
    "the best indirect tests for the presence of vlfs which mix with the conventional fermions are searches for new physics associated with deviations in couplings from sm expectations@xcite .",
    "two of the best tests here are our old friends quark - lepton universality in the guise of @xmath93 and the leptonic decays of the @xmath94 discussed above .",
    "to clarify this point we note that in models where , , the @xmath95 and @xmath96 mix with isodoublet vlfs the @xmath3 couples as @xmath97 whereas if the vlfs are isosinglets the corresponding coupling is @xmath98 .",
    "( the corresponding couplings can be also written down for the case of leptonic mixing . )",
    "we note also the general feature we find is that in models where the vlfs are in isodoublets @xmath99 and differences in @xmath100 , whereas the converse is true when the relevant vlfs are isosinglets .",
    "leptonic mixing will never show up as a shift in the value of @xmath101 since the modification in the amplitude occurs not only in the process @xmath102 but also in @xmath103 decay so that it is absorbed into the definition of @xmath104 . on the otherhand",
    "if quark mixing occurs @xmath101 will experience an apparent small shift(to leading order in the mixing angles ) @xmath105 in models with isodoublet vlfs and @xmath106 in the isosinglet vlf case .",
    "for the ratio @xmath107 in @xmath94 decay any modification of the hadronic matrix element will factor out so that there is no sensitivity to quark mixing . however , leptonic mixing no longer factorizes and we find a shift in @xmath107 by an amount @xmath108 in the case of isodoublet mixing and @xmath109 for isosinglets .",
    "recall that isodoublet leptonic mixing is only viable in models where the neutrino is dirac or the right - handed neutrino appears as an ordinary neutrino . in these same isodoublet models , the presence of both left- and right - handed cc couplings and heavy vlfs can lead to a contribution to the @xmath110 of the electron and @xmath111 which are typically both or order @xmath112 , neither of which are far from the present level of sensitivity .",
    "the mixing of the sm fermions with the vlf modify their couplings to the @xmath113 .",
    "these are difficult to observe particularly in the case of quarks due to the small size of the effect and qcd correction uncertainties . in the case of leptonic",
    "mixing there is not only the contribution due to mixing but there is an overall normalization change in the couplings due to our redefinition of @xmath104 .",
    "this mixing can lead to a shift in @xmath114 width by @xmath115 mev and an apparent shift in @xmath116 from the asymmetries of @xmath117 .",
    "again , shifts of this size are near the present limit of experimental sensitivity . in a similar manner sm expectations for @xmath118 in apv measurements",
    "may also be modified if sm mixing with the vlf occurs . however , in this case it is easy to show that the fractional change in @xmath118 due to these effects is only at the level of @xmath119 .",
    "if lqs are indeed real and we also believe that there is experimental evidence for coupling constant unification then we must begin to examine schemes which contain both ingredients as pointed out in@xcite . in the scenarios presented here the sm quantum numbers of the lq",
    "are fixed but new vlfs have now been introduced as well , all of which will alter the usual rge analysis of the running couplings .    before discussing susy models we note with some curiosity that coupling unification _ can _ occur in lq models containing exotic fermions even if susy is not introduced as was shown many years ago in @xcite .",
    "of course in the work of murayama and yanagida @xcite , the lq was an isodoublet and one of the particular models on the brw list , now excluded by the combined hera and tevatron data . in the scenarios presented above the lq",
    "is now a @xmath120 isosinglet so that the murayama and yanagida analysis does immediately apply .",
    "fortunately , we see from the results of ref . @xcite that a second possibility does exist for just this case : one adds to the sm spectrum the lq and its conjugate as well as a vector - like pair of color - triplet , isodoublets together with the field @xmath121 .",
    "this is the just particle content of the model a. to verify and update this analysis , let us assume for simplicity that all the new matter fields are introduced at the weak scale and take @xmath122 as input to a two - loop rge analysis .",
    "we then obtain the predictions that coupling unification occurs at @xmath123 gev and @xmath124 is predicted to be 0.118 . if unification does indeed occur we can estimate the proton lifetime@xcite to be @xmath125 years , safely above current constraints@xcite .",
    "we find this situation to be rather intriguing and we leave it to the reader to further ponder .",
    "of course there are other reasons to introduce susy beyond that of coupling constant unification .",
    "this subject has been discussed at some length in @xcite from which we extract several important observations : ( @xmath126 ) to _ trivially _ preserve the successful unification of the susy - sm , only complete @xmath127 representations can be added to the mssm spectrum . as is well - known",
    ", the addition of extra matter superfields in complete @xmath127 representations delays unification and brings the gut scale closer to the string scale .",
    "of course , there still remains the rather unnatural possibility of adding incomplete , but ` wisely chosen ' , split representations .",
    "employing split representations certainly allows for more flexibility at the price of naturalness but still requires us to choose sets of @xmath128 representations which will maintain asymptotic freedom and perturbative unification .",
    "an example of this rather bizarre scenario is the possibility of adding a @xmath129 from a * 15 * and a @xmath130 from a * 10 * to the low energy spectrum@xcite . here",
    "the notation refers to the @xmath131 quantum numbers of the representation .",
    "we remind the reader that the lq itself transforms as @xmath132 ; the smallest standard @xmath127 representation into which the @xmath133 can be embedded is a * 10*@xmath134 while in flipped-@xmath135@xcite , it can be placed in a * 5*@xmath136 .",
    "( @xmath137 ) since we are using vlfs in these models , it is clear that only pairs of representations , * r*@xmath138 , can be added to the mssm spectrum in order to maintain anomaly cancelation . of course this is also true for the lq superfield in that both lq and @xmath139 fields must now be present as discussed above .",
    "( @xmath140 ) to preserve perturbation theory and asymptotic freedom up to the gut scale when adding complete representations , at most one * 10*@xmath141 or three * 5*@xmath142 can be appended to the low energy spectrum of the mssm apart from sm singlets .",
    "the reason for this is the general observation that if one adds more than three , vector - like , color triplet superfields to the mssm particle content then the one - loop qcd beta function changes sign .",
    "recall that the lq itself _ already _ accounts for one of these color triplets .",
    "this same consideration also excludes the introduction of light exotic fields in higher dimensional @xmath143 representations .",
    "complete @xmath127 representations larger than * 10*@xmath141 are found to contribute more than this critical amount to the running of the qcd coupling .",
    "these are highly restrictive constraints on the construction of a successful gut scenario containing both vlfs and lqs and we see than none of the models discussed above can immediately satisfy them _ unless _ the lq and vlf superfields can be placed into a single @xmath127 representation . in the standard @xmath127 picture , we can then place @xmath144 , an isosinglet @xmath145 and @xmath139 into a single * 10 * with the corresponding conjugate fields in the @xmath146 .",
    "this would form a hybrid of model a with the ` skeleton ' model d , which we ve denoted by ad above . of",
    "course we pay no penalty for also including ` skeleton ' model c here as well , which then yields model acd .",
    "instead , when we consider the flipped-@xmath135 case , it would appear that we can place @xmath147 and @xmath139 into a @xmath148 with the conjugate fields in the * 5 * ; this is exactly model b. it would also seem that no penalty is paid as far as unification is concerned for including the ` skeleton ' model c here as well _ except _ that this would violate assumption ( @xmath140 ) about the chirality of lq couplings to fermions . however , this model is no longer truly unified since the hypercharge generator is not fully contained within the @xmath127 group itself and lies partly in the additional @xmath149 .",
    "while the @xmath143 and @xmath66 couplings will unify , @xmath150 will not join them even when arbitrary additional vector - like singlet fields are added .",
    "thus unification no longer occurs in this scenario so that this possibility is now excluded .",
    "the lq embedding situation becomes more perplexing if the lq and vlfs can not occupy the same gut multiplet . in this case unification and asymptotic freedom constraints",
    "become particularly tight and we are forced to consider the split multiplet approach mentioned above .",
    "this means that we add the fields @xmath151 and their conjugates at low energies but constrain them to be from different @xmath127 representations . in this case",
    "the combination @xmath152 corresponds to the isosinglet lq and its conjugate so what remains can only be the vlf fields .",
    "note that we have again arrived back at models ad and acd .",
    "are these the only solutions ?",
    "we have performed a systematic scan over a very large set of vlfs with various electroweak quantum numbers under the assumption that they are either color singlets or triplets , demanding only that ( @xmath126 ) qcd remains asymptotically free and ( @xmath137 ) the model passes the so - called `` b - test''@xcite which is highly non - trivial to arrange . essentially the b - test takes advantage of the observation that if we know the couplings at the weak scale and we demand that unification takes place _ somewhere _ then the values of the one - loop beta functions must be related . note",
    "that it is a necessary but not sufficient test on our choice of models but is very useful at chopping away a large region of parameter space . using the latest experimental data@xcite , we find that @xmath153 where the @xmath154 is an estimate of the corrections due to higher order as well as threshold effects and the @xmath155 are the one - loop beta functions of the three sm gauge groups .",
    "note that @xmath156 clearly satisfies the test .",
    "if we require that ( @xmath126 ) and ( @xmath137 ) be satisfied and also require that the unification scale not be too low then only the solutions described above survive after examining @xmath157 combinations of matter representations . while not completely exhaustive this search indicates the solutions above are fairly unique .",
    "it is interesting to observe that models constructed around model a produce successful grand unification both with and without susy .",
    "in this talk we have seen how a wealth of data from low and medium energy experiments as well as high energy colliders can be combined to point us in a fixed direction for lq model building .",
    "i have also discussed a general framework for the construction of new @xmath34 scalar lq models which go beyond the original classification by buchmller , rckl and wyler .",
    "this approach is based on the observation that in any realistic extension of the sm containing lqs it is expected that the lqs themselves will not be the only new ingredient .",
    "this construction technique is , of course , far more general than that required to address the specific issue of the hera excess .",
    "while the assumptions of gauge invariance and renormalizability are unquestionable requirements of model building , it is possible that the other conditions one usually imposes are much too strong  unless they are clearly demanded by data .",
    "this observation implies that for lqs to be experimentally accessible their couplings to sm fermions must be essentially chiral and separately conserve both baryon and lepton numbers . the assumption that lqs couple to only a single sm generation is surely a convenient way of avoiding numerous low energy flavor changing neutral current constraints but is far from natural in the mass eigenstate basis .",
    "what is required to obtain a new class of lq models is that the lqs themselves must be free to couple to more than just the sm fermions and gauge fields .    given the fixed gauge structure of the sm the most likely new interactions that lqs may possess are with the higgs field(s ) responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking and with new vlfs that are a common feature in many extensions of the sm .",
    "in the discussion above it has been shown how two new forms of the effective interactions of lqs with the sm fermions , consistent with tevatron searches , the hera excess in both the nc and cc channels and low - energy data , can arise through the action of vlfs and ordinary symmetry breaking .",
    "the typical vlf mass was found to lie in the low tev region and they could thus be directly produced at future colliders with known rates .",
    "we saw that we could construct ten new models which fell into two broad classes according to the chirality of the resulting lq couplings to the sm fermions .",
    "the vlfs themselves were shown to lead to a number of model - dependent effects which are close to the boundary of present experimental sensitivity .",
    "lqs within the framework of models containing vlfs were also shown to be consistent with grand unification in both a supersymmetric _ and _  non - supersymmetric context .",
    "the common feature of both schemes is the structure associated with model a , , the vlfs are color triplet , weak isodoublets in a @xmath129 representation and both @xmath158 and @xmath121 higgs fields are required to be present as is @xmath139 field . in both scenarios the gut scale is raised appreciably from the corresponding model wherein lqs and vector - like fermions are absent . in the susy case a @xmath159 field",
    "is also required with the optional addition of a sm singlet , corresponding to models ad and acd . in some sense , acd is the `` anti-@xmath160 '' model in that the color triplet vlfs are in isodoublets while the color singlet fields are all isosinglets .",
    "interestingly , in this scenario there is a vector - like fermion corresponding to every type of sm fermion .",
    "realistic lq models provide a rich source of new physics beyond the standard model .",
