    "since the discovery of the prototypical `` hot jupiter '' orbiting the star 51 pegasi in 1995 , more than 450 extrasolar planets have been identified .",
    "this flurry of discovery has been driven largely by technological innovation and the development of new observational techniques .",
    "precise doppler measurements have played a particularly important role in the discovery of extrasolar planets .",
    "the search for unseen orbiting companions to stars by measuring the subtle doppler shifts of stellar spectral lines is more than a century old ( e.g. @xcite ) , and since the late 1800s the precision of these measurements has improved by more than four orders of magnitude . since the amplitude of the doppler signal induced by an unseen companion is directly proportional to the companion s mass ,",
    "the discovery of extrasolar planets is a direct result of steady improvements to measurement techniques that have been used for over a century to study binary star systems .",
    "approximately @xmath9 of the known extrasolar planetary systems have low - mass star hosts ( m0-m4 ; www.exoplanet.eu ) .",
    "the bias in doppler surveys toward stars more massive than m dwarfs is due largely to the technical limitations of obtaining precise measurements of cool , intrinsically faint objects .",
    "understanding the rate of occurrence of planets orbiting these lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs , collectively referred to as ultracool dwarfs ( ucds , spectral types later than m5 ) , may have important implications for theories of planet formation since the core accretion and disk instability formation scenarios make different predictions about the occurrence of planetary companions as a function of host mass @xcite .",
    "while it has been shown that early m dwarfs have a relative paucity of close in jupiter - mass planets @xcite , we are just now beginning to understand the occurrence of super - earth ( @xmath10 ) planets to mid - m stars or any type of planet orbiting late - m or l dwarfs .",
    "doppler planet surveys generally include no ucd targets @xcite , so little is known about the rate at which planetary companions accompany the lowest mass stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "there are some initial indications from microlensing surveys that sub - jupiter - mass companions orbiting at several au from m dwarfs may be common @xcite , but these findings are not yet statistically robust .",
    "several examples of possible planetary companions to brown dwarfs do exist , including a @xmath11 companion found orbiting a young brown dwarf in a doppler survey conducted by @xcite , a giant planetary companion to 2m1207@xmath339 found by @xcite in a direct imaging survey , and a possible super - earth orbiting the ucd moa-2007-blg-192 detected via microlensing @xcite .",
    "there is strong observational evidence for the initial stages of planet formation around young ucds in the form of a high disk fraction @xcite and the formation of silicate grains @xcite .",
    "the formation of planets around ucds with @xmath12 has been modeled by @xcite who found that , depending on the mass of the protoplanetary disk , super - earths up to @xmath13 may be relatively common ( @xmath14 of ucds ) if disk mass scales linearly with host mass .",
    "the interaction of a planet with a gaseous disk leads to gravitational torques that can cause a planet to lose angular momentum and migrate within the disk .",
    "for small planets ( @xmath15 ) , the disk - planet interactions are linear , resulting in a type i migration that can cause very rapid inward movement .",
    "more massive planets may be able to open a gap in the protoplanetary disk and then torques between the planet and the inner and outer edges of the gap may cause the planet to slowly migrate inward through type ii migration .",
    "ucd planets may be found at relatively large separations ( @xmath16  au ) since inward migration to short orbital periods through type ii migration is not expected to be efficient in ucd protoplanetary disks .",
    "the detection of a significant population of close - in companions to ucds would place interesting constraints on planetary migration via the type i mechanism since the rapid inward movements due to this mechanism are expected to cause protoplanets to fall into the star on short timescales .",
    "@xcite predict that the formation of giant planetary companions to ucds should be completely inhibited and propose that systems like 2m1207@xmath339 form in a manner similar to that of binary stars .",
    "doppler planet searches are very sensitive to spectroscopic binary systems .",
    "binary star systems afford one of the few opportunities to directly measure the masses and radii of stars and measurements of stars in binary systems are an important component of the observational basis of our theoretical models of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "the are four different types of spectroscopic binary systems : single - lined ( sb1 ) , double - lined ( sb2 ) , single - lined eclipsing ( seb ) , and double - lined eclipsing ( deb ) . in an sb1 binary",
    "the reflex motion of the primary ( more luminous and usually more massive ) star is observed and when combined with the orbital period and eccentricity can be used to define a mass function , a transcendental equation involving the masses of both components and the inclination .",
    "the inclination of the system is not known , so additional observations , such as measurements of the astrometric orbit , are required to determine the actual masses of both components . in an sb2 system the spectral lines of",
    "both the primary and secondary are observed and the ratio of the radial velocity semi - amplitudes of the components directly determines the ratio of their masses ( @xmath17 ) . using a technique like todcor @xcite to analyze observations of an sb2 system it may also be possible to simultaneously determine mass and flux ratios of the components of the system , enabling direct tests of theoretical models of coeval low - mass stars and brown dwarfs . as with an sb1 system , the system inclination is not known in an sb2 , so individual masses can not be directly measured . in an seb system light from the secondary is not detected , but its presence is inferred from both the reflex motion of the primary and the diminution in brightness that occurs as the secondary eclipses the primary . in these systems ,",
    "of which the transiting extrasolar planets are a specific case , the orbital inclination is constrained by the fact that an eclipse occurs .",
    "the deb is a rare , but very important , type of binary that allows for precise measurements of the masses and radii of both components of the binary .",
    "very few ucd spectroscopic binaries are known , meaning that theoretical models of low - mass stars and brown dwarfs are relatively untested compared to models of sun - like stars .",
    "in fact , there are significant ( @xmath18 ) discrepancies between models and mass and radius measurements of low - mass stars in eclipsing binary systems @xcite . for ucds , only one deb system is known @xcite , serving as the lone observational benchmark for models of young brown dwarfs . in this young ( @xmath19  gyr ) system ,",
    "the measured radii are consistent with theoretical models but the estimated temperatures indicate that the less massive component is actually hotter , contrary to theoretical predictions for coeval brown dwarfs . since ucds that appear brightest in the sky are necessarily close to the sun ,",
    "direct imaging surveys have been very successful in detecting ucd binaries with orbital separations @xmath16  au . the orbital motions in these long - period visual binary systems can be observed ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , providing another opportunity to measure masses of ucds .",
    "discovering additional ucd binaries , particularly sb2 and deb systems , is crucial for improving our understanding of stellar astrophysics at and below the bottom of the main sequence .",
    "observations of a large sample of binary systems also enable tests of models of the formation history of ucds .",
    "the process through which ucds form is not well understood , and the statistical properties of the orbital separations and mass ratios of binary systems help to test potential formation scenarios .",
    "for example , some models of ucd formation suggest that these objects undergo ejection from star formation regions before they have the opportunity to accrete enough mass to become main - sequence stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if this is the case , wide binaries ( @xmath20  au ) with low binding energies are expected to be rare .",
    "thanks to direct imaging surveys , the binary fraction at large separations has been well studied .",
    "compared to sun - like stars , ucd binaries tend to have larger mass ratios ( @xmath21 ) and smaller separations ( @xmath22  au ) and very few wide ( @xmath20  au ) systems are seen .",
    "most systems with small ( @xmath6  au ) separations are not resolved by imaging surveys , but their relatively short periods ( years instead of decades ) make them prime targets for doppler surveys . since no comprehensive doppler survey of ucds has been carried out , our understanding of the overall distribution of system properties is incomplete at small separations @xcite .    obtaining precise doppler measurements poses a significant technical challenge , particularly if the target is a ucd . in the 1970s astronomers realized that having a simultaneous wavelength calibrator that superimposes absorption features of known wavelengths onto a source spectrum provides a major advantage in terms of doppler precision for slit spectrographs @xcite . prior to the advent of the gas cell technique",
    "( hf by @xcite and later i@xmath23 ) , atomic and molecular absorption features in the earth s atmosphere were used for this purpose . while not inherently stable like the gas in an absorption cell , telluric lines have been used to produce doppler measurements with a month - to - month precision of 5 - 20 m s@xmath1 @xcite . after making corrections based on a simple model of atmospheric winds ,",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that atmospheric o@xmath24 lines at optical wavelengths can be used to make rv measurements with a precision of 2 m s@xmath1 over timescales of years .",
    "doppler measurements of sun - like stars with a precision exceeding 1 m s@xmath1 have been demonstrated using two different techniques for calibrating high - resolution spectroscopic data . for bright early - m dwarfs both the thorium - argon ( thar ) emission lamps and simultaneous iodine ( i@xmath23 ) absorption cells",
    "have been used to obtain rv precision of 3 - 5 m s@xmath1 @xcite . due to their cool temperatures ( @xmath25k ) and small sizes ( @xmath26 ) , ucds",
    "are intrinsically very faint at the wavelengths where these measurements are made ( 400 to 700 nm ) , limiting observations to only the few brightest targets on the sky .",
    "making precise doppler measurements at near infrared ( nir ) wavelengths is a very attractive option for exploring the population of planets orbiting ucds .    until quite recently ,",
    "the precision of nir doppler measurements of ucds has tended to lag behind that of rv measurements of sun - like stars by two orders of magnitude .",
    "this is due in part to the relative complexity and expense of nir echelle spectrographs , the relative faintness of cool dwarfs , and to the worse noise properties of nir detectors compared to ccds .",
    "in addition , there has been a lack of suitable wavelength references in the nir .",
    "the i@xmath23 cell is not effective at these wavelengths , but the th lines in thar emission lamps may prove useful in @xmath27 and @xmath28 bands . both @xcite and @xcite",
    "provide a summary of future prospects for calibrating nir echelle spectra using gas absorption cells and emission line lamps .",
    "the nir is replete with telluric absorption lines due to h@xmath23o and ch@xmath0 .",
    "in this spectral region ucds have a rich set of molecular absorption features that can potentially be used to make precise doppler measurements .",
    "we have developed a technique that relies on telluric ch@xmath0 absorption features as a simultaneous wavelength reference and exploits the rich set of co absorption features found in the spectra of ucds near 2.3@xmath29 m to make doppler measurements with a limiting precision of approximately 50 m s@xmath1 .",
    "high - resolution nir spectrographs that could make use of this technique are expected to be an important component of the suites of instruments on future large telescopes and @xcite and @xcite report the development of new high - resolution instruments that should be able to achieve 10 m s@xmath1 precision at nir wavelengths .",
    "doppler measurements with a precision of @xmath30 m s@xmath1 have been demonstrated by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , and a doppler precision in the range 5 - 20 m s@xmath1 has been demonstrated on short timescales using the crires instrument on vlt by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite used an nh@xmath31 absorption cell with crires to obtain rv measurements of bright ( @xmath32 ) mid - m dwarfs in k band with a precision approaching 5 m s@xmath1 .",
    "we do not expect to reach this impressive level of precision for two reasons : first , the resolution of nirspec is r=25000 , which is significantly worse than that of crires ( r=100000 ) .",
    "second , all but eight of the 59 targets in our survey have k magnitudes between 11 and 12.5 , significantly fainter than the faintest targets reported in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "we report the results of a doppler survey of 59 ucds using the nirspec instrument on the keck ii telescope .",
    "our observations span a period of six years and we demonstrate sensitivity to giant planetary companions as well as ucd - ucd binaries with small orbital separations . in section 2",
    "we describe our ucd sample and our nirspec observations . in section 3",
    "we describe the details of our reduction and calibration of the nirspec data . in section 4",
    "we describe our nir doppler technique , the expected precision , and potential sources of noise that limit the overall precision we achieve . in section 5",
    "we discuss the overall statistical properties of our doppler measurements .",
    "in section 6 we describe four individual rv variables and present orbital solutions . in section 7",
    "we describe the rotational and kinematic properties of our sample and compare the distributions of these values to those in the literature . in section 8",
    "we estimate the rate of tight ( @xmath6au ) ucd binaries and simulate the sensitivity of our survey to giant planet companions .",
    "thanks to all - sky nir surveys such as 2mass , sdss , and denis , the l spectral class is a well - studied group of several hundred old low - mass stars and younger brown dwarfs . there is an inherent degeneracy between age and spectral type for these objects , but at field ages ( @xmath33  gyr ) the mid - l dwarfs are expected to be brown dwarfs , objects with masses below the minimum required for main sequence hydrogen burning , while late m and early l dwarfs may be very small hydrogen burning stars @xcite .",
    "the brown dwarfs slowly cool , radiating away their initial thermal energy over billions of years . with their cool temperatures ,",
    "the atmospheres of ucds contain a wide array of molecules , including tio , vo , and co , as well as dust particles , leading to complex nir spectra @xcite .",
    "we selected a sample of field ucd dwarfs brighter than @xmath34 observable from mauna kea ( dec@xmath35 ) .",
    "our targets and their observed properties are listed in table 1 .",
    "the majority of our targets are classified as l dwarfs , though three may be classified as early - l or late - m depending on the spectral diagnostics used .",
    "today , our sample contains more than @xmath36 of the known l dwarfs that satisfy our magnitude and declination limits ( www.dwarfarchives.org ) , though a number of new l dwarfs were discovered during the course of our survey . between march , 2003 and may , 2009 we collected approximately 600 individual observations of a sample of 59 ucds using the nirspec @xcite instrument on the keck ii telescope .",
    "nirspec is a high - resolution , cross - dispersed nir echelle spectrograph and is a powerful instrument for high - resolution spectroscopy of cool stars and brown dwarfs .",
    "while nirspec can be operated in conjunction with the ao system , our observations were obtained without ao since many of our targets are too faint for ao observations .",
    "we selected the 3-pixel ( 0.432@xmath37 ) slit , the n7 order blocking filter , the thin ir blocker , and a spectrograph configuration designed to place our desired spectral region around the co bandhead ( 2.285 to 2.318  @xmath38 ) near the center of echelle order 33 .",
    "this setup provided a resolution of r=25000 and the 3-pixel slit was a good match for the typical seeing in k - band at mauna kea .",
    "over the course of our survey we utilized this same spectrograph set - up and by using emission line lamps we were able to adjust the echelle and cross disperser angles in order to reproduce the positions of the echelle orders to within @xmath39  nm .",
    "nirspec employs a 1024x1024 pixel aladdin insb array with 27@xmath38 pixels and all of our science data were gathered using fowler sampling ( mcds-16 ) readouts in order to reduce the read noise to the nominal level of 25  e@xmath40 .",
    "we gathered observations of our targets in nod pairs where the target was nodded along the slit by approximately 6@xmath37 between the first and second exposures of a pair .",
    "this observing strategy facilitates the removal of sky emission lines through the subtraction of consecutive 2d images .",
    "we selected integration times so as to achieve a s / n per pixel of between 50 and 100 in each of our individual extracted 1d spectra with exposure times ranging from 500 to 1200 seconds per nod position . on each night",
    "we gathered an extensive set of calibration data including a large number of flat field images and observations of bright , rapidly rotating a stars at a range of airmasses .",
    "the a star spectra are free from stellar absorption features in our spectral region and are therefore useful for monitoring changes in telluric absorption . during the course of our survey we obtained between two and 16 epochs of observations for each target in our sample .",
    "this inhomogeneous pattern of visits was determined in part by the scheduling of our observing time , but objects were also prioritized based on their projected rotational velocity , @xmath4 .",
    "typically , we observed objects with large @xmath4 , which limits our doppler precision , only twice , while objects exhibiting clear evidence for doppler variations were observed at every opportunity .",
    "we reduced the nirspec data and extracted spectra from order 33 using a set of custom idl procedures developed for this survey to flat field the 2d spectra , trace the spectral orders , and extract 1d spectra . for each observing session , which we defined as the period between physical movements of the internal components of the spectrograph ,",
    "sets of 20 flat field images were median combined to produce a `` superflat '' . as a result of computer or hardware problems , there were occasionally multiple observing sessions defined within a single observing night .",
    "the individual flat fields have an integration time of 4s , resulting in an average signal of @xmath41 adu per pixel in order 33 .",
    "the aladdin detector has a small dark current ( 0.2 e@xmath1 pixel@xmath1 s@xmath1 ) so we also gathered 4s dark frames for use in the creation of the superflats .",
    "prior to median combination the individual flat fields were each normalized so as to compensate for changes in the overall flux levels due to warming of the flat field lamp .",
    "we used the superflat to trace echelle order 33 and to define the position of the order across the detector .",
    "since we replicated the same spectrograph configuration during each observing session , the positions of the echelle orders are known to within a few pixels _ a priori _ in all of our data .",
    "we began the reduction and extraction procedures by subtracting nod pairs .",
    "provided that changes in the detector or spectrograph properties were negligible over the timescale of the nod pair , this effectively removes the dark current and the bias level of the detector .",
    "if the sky brightness is not rapidly changing then night sky emission lines are also removed by pair subtraction . following subtraction , the two resulting 2d difference images ( a - b and b - a ) were flat fielded using the superflat to compensate for sensitivity variations both across the order and at the pixel - to - pixel level , resulting in intensity rectified difference images .",
    "we trimmed 24 noisy columns from one edge of the detector , leaving a total of 1,000 columns . in our description of the data the echelle orders run roughly parallel to the rows of the detector .",
    "we extracted spectra from the intensity rectified difference images following the procedures outlined in @xcite .",
    "the position of the spectrum across order 33 was determined by fitting a gaussian in the spatial direction at each column and then fitting the resulting centers to a fourth - order polynomial with outlier rejection . using the difference image",
    ", we built an empirical model of the spectral profile within order 33 in the spatial direction .",
    "this model accommodates smooth variations in the width or shape of the profile across the order and is normalized so that the integral of the spectral profile at each column is unity . at each column",
    "we fit this model spectral profile to the data by solving for the scale factor and an additive offset , to account for incomplete sky subtraction , that best fits the data in a least squares sense .",
    "the variance for each pixel was determined from the quoted gain and read noise estimated from a region of the nirspec detector between the spectral orders .",
    "we found that the read noise estimated in this way was often close to 75 e@xmath40 , much larger than the quoted value of 25 e@xmath40 .",
    "the optimal estimate of the total flux at each of the 1,000 columns was determined by the scale factor of the best - fit model spectral profile .",
    "each profile fit was conducted iteratively to mitigate the effects of cosmic rays or bad pixels by rejecting outliers and then re - fitting .",
    "some of our nirspec data exhibit a significant additional noise .",
    "a transient pattern is sometimes seen in a single quadrant of the nirspec detector such that every eighth row has significantly enhanced noise .",
    "the phase of this pattern changes in time both within a night and between nights while the eight pixel periodicity remains fixed .",
    "these noisy rows run roughly parallel to the echelle orders so , depending on the phase of the pattern , they can have a significant impact on the s / n of the extracted data .",
    "the enhanced noise was seen in approximately 22@xmath42 of our observations , though not always in the immediate vicinity of order 33 . in a smaller subset of our data",
    "more complex noise patterns were seen with multiple patterns each having an eight pixel period .",
    "we visually inspected all of the individual extracted spectra and culled approximately @xmath14 as having poor s / n or severe noise problems due to order 33 falling along a particularly noisy row .",
    "we forward modeled the extracted spectra to measure the stellar radial velocity ( rv ) and projected rotational velocity ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this procedure followed the methods described in @xcite and is similar to that used by @xcite to obtain 3 m s@xmath1 doppler precision at optical wavelengths using an i@xmath43 absorption cell .",
    "our simultaneous calibrator is ch@xmath0 located not in a cell but in earth s atmosphere .",
    "the basis for our modeling procedure is the interpolation and convolution of high - resolution spectral models to fit the lower resolution nirspec data , which we denote @xmath44 , by minimizing @xmath45 .",
    "the basic form of our model can be expressed    @xmath46 \\times t(\\lambda)\\right ) \\star lsf\\ ] ]    where @xmath47 indicates convolution , @xmath48 is a high resolution ucd template , @xmath49 is the rotational broadening kernel , @xmath50 is the telluric spectrum , and @xmath51 is the spectrograph line spread function .",
    "we began with a library of high - resolution synthetic template spectra computed as described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the models apply the condensation cloud model of @xcite with a sedimentation parameter of @xmath52 , corresponding to a moderate amount of condensate settling .",
    "the models used here have solar metallicity @xcite , use the opacities described in @xcite , a fixed gravity of @xmath53 ( cgs ) , and cover a range of @xmath54 from 1200 to 2400@xmath55k .",
    "the synthetic spectra provide monochromatic fluxes spaced @xmath56 m apart .",
    "we incorporated line broadening due to stellar rotation by convolving with the kernel defined by @xcite using a linear limb - darkening parameter of 0.6 as appropriate for cool stars at infrared wavelengths @xcite .",
    "we also used a high - resolution ( @xmath57 m  spacing ) telluric spectrum derived from observations of the sun provided by @xcite . using quadratic interpolation we placed the synthetic ucd template and telluric model onto an evenly spaced wavelength grid with @xmath58 m spacing , about five times finer than the nirspec data .",
    "we convolved the product of the rotationally - broadened ucd template and the telluric model with an estimate of the spectrograph line spread function ( lsf ) .",
    "finally , we used quadratic interpolation to place the model on the lower resolution nirspec wavelength grid , which we define through polynomial mapping of pixel to wavelength . in total the model of each individual spectrum",
    "has the following 11 free parameters : four for the polynomial mapping of pixel to wavelength , one for an overall flux scaling , four for a flux gradient across the spectrum , one for the lsf fwhm under the assumption that the lsf is a normalized gaussian , and one for the ucd rv .",
    "we also had fixed parameters for the scaling of the telluric model with airmass , which we define later in this section , as well as the @xmath4 and effective temperature , @xmath59 , for each ucd , which we determined separately and fixed in all subsequent analyses .",
    "we fit our model to the nirspec data in a least squares sense using an implementation of the amoeba @xcite fitting method to minimize @xmath45 .",
    "we began our analysis of the nirspec data by selecting a training sample of 200 a star observations acquired over the course of the survey at a range of airmasses from 1.0 to 2.0 .",
    "examples of a star spectra at a range of airmasses are shown in figure [ astars ] .",
    "we modeled these observations without including the ucd template in order to refine our fitting procedure , determine the overall distribution of the best - fit wavelength and lsf parameters , and model the changes of the depths of telluric lines with airmass . starting from the nominal 10 model parameters ( no rv ) we added an additional free parameter for the scaling of the depths of the telluric lines with airmass .",
    "the @xcite data is at airmass ( am ) of 1.5 , but our data were acquired at a wider range of airmasses . at higher airmass the optical depth of the atmosphere increases and we expect the telluric line depths to increase .",
    "we assumed a one parameter scaling of the depths of the telluric lines from the am=1.5 model ( @xmath60 ) with airmass @xmath61 .",
    "based on the fits to the a star training sample , we found that the telluric line depths observed at the summit of mauna kea , shown in figure [ tau ] , were well fit with @xmath62 .",
    "after this initial determination of the telluric scaling we adopted this relation for @xmath63 for all of the subsequent fitting of nirspec spectra and fixed this parameter in the modeling of each ucd spectrum .    in order for our fitting procedure to successfully converge on the correct model parameters , excellent initial estimates of the parameters were required .",
    "the a star training sample allowed us to determine the average model parameters related to the spectrograph and select good initial values for each parameter .",
    "we found that our nominal model resulted in a star fits with @xmath64 . adding additional parameters for the wavelength solution did not significantly improve the overall quality of the fits .",
    "we also found that conducting an initial cross - correlation of the first 200-pixel chunk with a nominal model of a nirspec a star observation allowed for the determination of the zeroth - order term in the wavelength solution to better than 0.1 of a nirspec pixel , sufficiently precise for amoeba to reliably converge on the correct wavelength solution .",
    "we investigated how the lsf changes across the spectral order by fitting portions of a star spectra independently . while the fwhm of the gaussian lsfs across the spectra change with time , we found that the ratios of the fwhm of the best - fit gaussian lsfs in different portions of the spectra were relatively constant so that a single fixed parameter could be used to describe the slow change in the width of the lsf across the order . by looking at the average residuals of the fits to all 200 a stars we also identified individual telluric lines that did not follow the scaling with airmass . in figure [ fig2 ] we show four lines that are likely not @xmath65 absorption features but may be features due to @xmath66 @xcite .",
    "we excluded a small spectral region ( ten pixels ) around each of these features in all of our fitting of the ucd spectra by assigning zero statistical weight .",
    "the residuals of the model fits to the a star sample are shown in figure [ fig2 ] . with our instrumental setup a fringe - like modulation was often seen in the extracted spectra and is clearly visible in the a star residual around 2.314  @xmath29 m in figure [ astars ] .",
    "this pattern is likely due to an internal reflection in an optical element near the detector @xcite and is generally described as the superposition of sinusoidal patterns with amplitudes of roughly @xmath67 and periods of approximately @xmath68  nm . an additional complication is that the spatial frequency of the fringe pattern is similar to the spatial frequencies of absorption features seen in slowly rotating ucds , so it can not be easily removed without degrading the signal that we wish to model .",
    "like @xcite we found that the fringing pattern varies somewhat over time in phase , frequency , and amplitude . assuming that the fringe signal is multiplicative ( as opposed to additive ) we built a model of the average fringe signal in wavelength space by averaging the a star residuals ( @xmath69 ) in bins of width @xmath70  nm .",
    "this model , shown in figure [ fig2 ] , is fixed in wavelength space and has an amplitude of approximately @xmath67 and is quasi - periodic with a dominant period of @xmath68  nm . including this fringe model in the fitting of the a star sample resulted in sigificant improvements in @xmath71 for the highest s / n spectra though had negligible impact on the resulting overall distribution of the best - fit model parameters .",
    "given that the fringe pattern is a quasi - periodic multiplicative modulation it is possible that the average shapes of the telluric lines , and therefore the resulting wavelength solutions , could be biased as a function of the relative phase of the fringe and the telluric absorption features .",
    "at the same time , the fact that the fringe model is not strictly periodic could mean that this effect averages out over the spectrum , reducing the impact on the resulting fits .",
    "given the small amplitude of the fringe model compared to the s / n of our a star observations ( s / n@xmath72 ) it is perhaps not surprising that it is not an important factor in our fits .",
    "we fit the ucd spectra following an iterative process using the average parameter values determined from the a star analysis as the starting parameters for amoeba . as with the a star analysis",
    ", we used the first 200-pixel chunk of each spectrum to estimate the zeroth - order term of the wavelength solutions by cross correlating against a nominal telluric model . this first 200-pixel chunk",
    "( 2.585 to 2.592 @xmath29 m ) of the ucd spectrum is relatively devoid of stellar absorption features and so fitting this chunk to the telluric - only model was useful both for determining the starting wavelength position as well as the single lsf fwhm parameter .",
    "we also produced an initial rv estimate by cross correlating a spectral region with rich co features ( 2.298 to 2.305 @xmath29 m ) against a fiducial ucd model at zero velocity .",
    "this step , which we found necessary for ensuring convergence of the fitting process , provides a rough ( @xmath7310 km s@xmath1 ) estimate of the rv that includes shifts due to barycentric motion .",

    "we adopted the simple average of the individual estimates from each spectrum as the fixed @xmath4 of the ucd and the scatter of those estimates as the error on the @xmath4 .",
    "these two parameters , @xmath59 and @xmath4 , were then fixed for all subsequent analyses .",
    "we determined the lower limit on @xmath4 , set by the resolution of nirspec , by estimating the value below which changes in @xmath4 did not improve the @xmath45 of the fits to ucds that are known to be slow rotators .    with the global ucd parameters fixed ( @xmath4 and @xmath59 ) for each target , we estimated the rv of each observation of each target using the same fitting process .",
    "each spectrum was fit in two stages , rejecting outliers following an initial fit and then fitting again using the best fit parameters from the first fit as the new starting parameters .",
    "we conducted extensive tests using artificial spectra to ensure that the correct minima were being found by amoeba by conducting fits with fixed wavelength solutions over a large , high - resolution parameter space .",
    "we generated the artificial spectra based on the wavelength solutions found in the a star analysis , the synthetic ucd templates over a range of @xmath59 and @xmath4 , and noise properties representative of the actual nirspec data .",
    "we found that with good starting values our amoeba fitting procedure reliably converged on the true minimum of @xmath45 and the correct model parameters .",
    "the formal reduced @xmath45 of the ucd fits fall in a wide range ( 2@xmath76 ) . unlike with the a star analysis , where the @xmath45 is likely dominated by the noise properties of the nirspec detector and limitations in our lsf model , the ucd fits may be dominated by the mismatch between the theoretical stellar templates and the ucd and we expect some larger values of @xmath45 .",
    "for example , systematic discrepancies are sometimes seen in the structure of the co bandhead or in the depths of individual co features longward of the bandhead .",
    "we emphasize that systematic deviations between the spectra and the theoretical models may not be shortcomings of the models themselves but rather a symptom of the small range of our library of synthetic templates in terms of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and metallicity .",

    "based on the standard deviations of the rv measurements of 43 of our targets with observations on three or more epochs , @xmath92 km s@xmath1 , and excluding known or suspected variables , shown in figure [ rmshist ] , we estimate our rv precision to be approximately 100 - 300 m s@xmath1 for slowly rotating ucds . in figure [ vsinrms ]",
    "we compare the measured standard deviation of the rvs of each of our targets to the estimated @xmath4 .",

    "this object is more massive than the stars in our ucd sample , falling outside the @xmath59 range of our synthetic templates . for the spectral",

    "we note that the scatter of these rv measurements is well - described by the pldp error estimates obtained using the technique described in section 4 [ @xmath96 indicating that at least for bright , slowly rotating objects we are achieving an rv precision very close to the photon limit .    to reliably estimate the statistical significance of any rv variations we detect in our ucd sample it is necessary to understand the underlying errors , both systematic and statistical , on our individual measurements .",
    "we have estimated the statistical errors on our individual rv measurements , @xmath79 , directly from the data , but these estimates do not take into account systematic effects that may occur between epochs . to investigate the overall statistical properties of our measurements we selected a sub - sample of objects that have observations on three or more epochs and are not known or suspected binaries . assuming the null hypothesis that each of these ucds has a constant rv , using the empirically - determined internal errors , @xmath79 , for each of the 207 measured rvs we calculated @xmath97 for @xmath98 degrees of freedom ( assuming one parameter for the constant rv of each target ) .",
    "if we have excluded all of the actual rv variables from this analysis , then this value of @xmath99 indicates that our statistical error estimates are too small and that there is a significant systematic contribution to be included in our overall error model . the overall error distribution for this sub - sample is shown in figure [ residnorm ] , which shows that there are significant non - gaussian tails at @xmath100rv@xmath101 .",
    "we scaled all of the pldp errors estimates for the ucds by a factor of @xmath102 , resulting in a reduction of the @xmath99 to 163.6 for the same number of degrees of freedom @xmath103 $ ] . in some cases it is clear that the scaled errors are too large .",
    "for example , the scatter about the best fit orbital solution for the binary 2m0320@xmath304 , described in section 6.1 , is 135 m @xmath1 while the smallest error estimate for a single point in the fit is 178 m s@xmath1 . despite this possible overestimation , we used the scaled rv error estimates for all subsequent analyses of the ucd rv measurements . based on our observations of the rv standard",
    "gj 628 we conclude that our modeling process can produce rv measurements near the photon - limit over long timescales and that the worse overall rv precision obtained for the ucds could be due to a number of factors .",
    "the tails of the distribution of @xmath104 could be the result of real rv variability since we have only excluded known and suspected binaries from our sub - sample .",
    "while the theoretical template used to model gj 628 is a very good match for its spectrum , mismatch between the theoretical templates and the actual spectra of the ucds could lead to worse rv precision .",
    "lastly , it is possible that the much longer integration times used for the ucd observations compared to the gj 628 observations lead to systematic effects that are not encompassed in our model .      in an effort to increase the overall precision of our rv measurements , as well as to address some technical issues that may be important for efforts to achieve high rv precision in the nir with nirspec or similar instruments",
    ", we experimented with some modification to the standard fitting process described in section 4 .",
    "the first was the inclusion of the fringe model derived from observations of a stars into the ucd fits . including this fringing model in the a star fitting process led to significant improvements to the resulting @xmath71 , though had negligible impact on the overall statistical properties of the resulting model parameters .",
    "similarly , including the fringe model in the analysis of the gj 628 observations did not result in a statistically significant decrease in the resulting rv scatter . while the a star and gj 628 observations typically have s / n@xmath72 , the ucd observations have @xmath105s / n@xmath106 .",
    "the low - amplitude flux modulation of the fringe pattern is small compared to the read noise and photon noise and so was not expected to significantly impact the fitting process .",
    "we did experiment with including the fringe model in the flitting of the ucd spectra and found that the overall statistical properties of the resulting rv measurements were consistent with or without the fringe model and that the photon - limited errors still needed to be scaled by a factor of @xmath107 to account for the observed scatter in the rv measurements of individual objects .",
    "the fringe model was not included in the final ucd rv results presented here .",
    "while our theoretical templates are generally a very good match for the ucd spectra , for some individual objects there are significant systematic discrepancies in the shapes of the spectral features .",
    "this is most likely due to the fact we are only fitting a small library of synthetic templates to our spectra and a wider range of @xmath77 , @xmath78 , metallicity values , and line damping treatments could significantly improve the fits for some objects .",
    "if we have multiple observations of an object , and we can assume that the object has a constant rv , then it is possible to build an empirical spectral template from the observations themselves .",
    "we began by fitting the spectra using the theoretical templates following the standard procedure described in section 4 . assuming that the wavelength solutions were sufficiently well - determined by this initial fit we divide the data by the telluric component of our best fit model , resulting in a normalized ucd spectrum that is free from atmospheric absorption features .",
    "we corrected the wavelength solutions for the known barycentric velocity of each spectrum and then averaged all of the normalized spectra in 0.01  nm bins to create an empirical spectral template .",
    "for a slowly rotating ucd , where @xmath4 is comparable to or smaller than the spectrograph resolution , it is necessary to account for the broadening of the stellar spectral features by the lsf of the spectrograph . to do this we assumed a gaussian lsf with fwhm=@xmath108  nm and carried out an iterative deconvolution following @xcite on the empirical template in an attempt to recover the un - broadened spectrum . using this method we created an empirical template for the rapidly rotating ( @xmath109 km s@xmath1 ) l dwarf 2m0652 + 47 and found that the overall fit residuals were reduced to the level of @xmath67 .",
    "we also generated templates for more slowly rotating objects and a comparison between a theoretical template and an empirical template for the slowly rotating l dwarf 2m0835@xmath308 is shown in figure [ empiric ] . while this technique did in some cases",
    "result in templates that were significantly better fits to the observed spectra , there are a number of drawbacks .",
    "the first is that a large number of spectra are required to produce the empirical template , preferably more than five , in order to robustly average in wavelength bins .",
    "the second is that we began by assuming that the object has a constant rv .",
    "intrinsic doppler shifts will result in a broadened spectral template and , particularly if the number of spectra is small , the empirical template may result in biased rv estimates .",
    "we found that using empirical templates to fit the subset of our sample with observations on five or more epochs did not yield rvs with a smaller dispersion . with our current data",
    "the creation of empirical templates may be most useful when looking for temporal changes in the residuals of the fits , which could be evidence for a faint companion .",
    "as the precision of rv measurements at optical wavelengths has improved to the level of 1 m s@xmath1 it has become clear that modeling the shape of the spectrograph s lsf is critically important .",
    "@xcite used a basis set of 11 gaussian functions to model the subtle changes in the lsf asymmetries in their @xmath110 cell observations .",
    "spectrograph lsf asymmetries may be inherent to the instrument or , in a slit spectrograph , they may arise from guiding errors inducing variations in the stellar position along the slit .",
    "we modeled the nirspec lsf as a symmetric , gaussian function that has a linear variation in width across the order .",
    "we experimented extensively with using multiple gaussians to describe a more complex lsf in a manner similar to @xcite .",
    "owing to the limited s / n of our data , we could not reliably model the lsf asymmetry in either the a star or ucd spectra .",
    "future improvements in the rv precision obtained using this technique will require a detailed modeling of the spectrograph lsf but the current spectral resolution and s / n may not motivate such an analysis .",
    "the measurements from our nirspec survey , listed in table 2 , represent the largest available sample of high - resolution , high - s / n , nir observations of l dwarfs .",

    "the measurements , given in table 9 , are well - fit by a linear rv trend with a slope of @xmath187  m s@xmath1 per year . using a monte - carlo simulation we estimated the false alarm probability of observing a slope @xmath188 m s@xmath1 per year to be 2.2@xmath42 .",
    "this linear trend is also consistent with a single rv measurement from @xcite obtained in 2000 , though this optical measurement has a very large error bar ( @xmath189 km s@xmath1 near hjd 2451661 ) .",
    "@xcite report a velocity difference between 2000 and 2004 of 2.5 km s@xmath1 for this object , which is incompatible with the velocity trend seen in our data , though we note that these measurements also have large errors bars .",
    "we calculated the secular rv acceleration ( @xmath190 ) for this object following @xcite and estimated the maximum amplitude of this effect to be less than 0.6 m s@xmath1 yr@xmath1 , far smaller than the observed trend .",
    "the trend seen in our nirspec observations could be indicative of a very long period system with @xmath191 d , but we note that within our sub - sample of 46 objects observed on three or more epochs we may expect to observe at least one long - term slope with a false - alarm probability of @xmath192 .    the mass of the l5 primary is poorly constrained based on photometry alone , but comparing absolute magnitudes and the temperature ( @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 from @xcite ) to models from @xcite and @xcite , the minimum mass is expected to be in the range @xmath196 depending on the age of the system , assuming ( based on the object s kinematics ) @xmath197gyr . based on the lack of li absorption , @xcite determined that this l dwarf has a minimum mass of @xmath198 .",
    "if we assume that the binary has near equal mass components , as is observed to be the case for many low - mass binaries @xcite , with @xmath199 , then the mean orbital separation for a circular orbit would be @xmath200 au if @xmath191  d. at a distance of 7.3 pc this corresponds to an angular separation of @xmath201 .",
    "unless the system is close to edge - on and observed at a very unfavorable phase , then such a binary would have been readily resolved in the high - resolution imaging observations presented by @xcite and @xcite who found no luminous ( @xmath202 mag ) companions to 2m1507@xmath316 over a range of separations @xmath203 . approximating the detection limit for faint companions from @xcite as @xmath204 and assuming the 5 gyr models from @xcite for the secondary and 5 gyr models from @xcite for the primary",
    "then the non - detection constrains the mass ratio of the system to be @xmath205 .",
    "it is also possible that the period of the system is much longer than 5000 d , resulting in an angular separation too large to be detected in the narrow fields of view of high - resolution imaging surveys .",
    "using nir imaging data obtained in 2005 and described in @xcite we detect only one source in an annulus of @xmath206 to @xmath207 down to limiting magnitude of @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "this source is also visible in archival 2mass observations from 1998 and does not share the large ( @xmath210 year@xmath1 ; @xcite ) proper motion of 2m1507 - 16 .      the orbital motion of the two components of this tight ( @xmath211 mas ) binary system has been directly observed with high - resolution imaging , resulting in the measurement of the sum of the masses and the first dynamical mass estimate for an l dwarf @xcite .",
    "based on high spatial resolution observations with hst , vlt , and gemini , the orbital period of this system is estimated to be @xmath212 days , so our nirspec observations , shown in figure [ 2m0746 ] , span a considerable fraction of a period .",
    "the fit to the astrometric orbit determines the sum of the masses , @xmath213 , and the semi - major axis @xmath214 au .",
    "the components of this system are resolved and the flux ratio of the components is measured to be 1.6:1 at @xmath49 band . based on the orbital parameters determined in @xcite and the mass estimates from @xcite , the expected rv separation at periastron passage is @xmath215 km s@xmath1 . using nirspec with",
    "ao @xcite resolved this system and obtained rv measurements for both components . combining these measurements with the astrometric orbit",
    "yields direct measurements of the masses of both components , though for the case of 2m0746 + 20 the errors on the mass estimates are relatively large .",
    "while the flux ratio of the system is favorable for detecting the spectral lines of the secondary , the velocity separation is small compared to the nirspec resolution , particularly for observations that do not coincide with the periastron passage in 2003 . in this case where both components are of similar brightness , are expected to have similar spectral features , and are not resolved in velocity , we are effectively measuring the rv of the combined light of the system . if the components have exactly equal masses , spectral features , and luminosities , we would observe no rv variations at all . as a result of this combined light effect",
    "we do not necessarily expect to measure the true rv of 2m0746 + 20a using our technique . using the orbital parameters from the astrometric orbit from @xcite we fit for @xmath112 and @xmath126 assuming that the light from 2m0746 + 20b has a negligible impact on the measured rv and found @xmath216 km s@xmath1 and @xmath217 km s@xmath1 .",
    "the resulting rv orbit is shown in figure [ 2m0746 ] .",
    "we emphasize that these orbital parameters are very likely biased by the influence of 2m0746 + 20b , in particular our estimate of @xmath112 is expected to be too low .",
    "we carried out a simulation to assess the impact of a marginally - resolved secondary by fitting mock spectra that contained light from a secondary with a flux ratio of @xmath218 and velocity offsets of between @xmath219 km s@xmath1 from the primary .",
    "we found that such companions significantly influenced the resulting rv measurement from fitting the combined light , @xmath220 , and that @xmath221 , meaning that our rv measurements near periastron passage could be biased by up to a few km s@xmath1 .",
    "our observations can also be used to study the statistics of the rotational and space velocities of ucds .",
    "the rotational velocities of brown dwarfs and low - mass stars are important for understanding the angular momentum history of these objects .",
    "measurements of a large number of ucd @xmath4 values exist in the literature , though the measurements were made using techniques different from the one employed here .",
    "@xcite estimated rotational velocities by fitting the rotationally - broadened feh stellar absorption features near @xmath222 m using data from hires at keck i and uves at vlt .",
    "these optical data are of higher resolution than our nirspec data resulting in @xmath4 sensitivity down to 3 km s@xmath1 .",
    "both @xcite , using vlt and the uves spectrograph , and @xcite , using keck and nirspec , follow the traditional technique of cross - correlating their spectra with a slowly rotating template and estimating @xmath4 from the width of the resulting cross correlation function .",
    "as shown in figure [ vsin ] , we find excellent overall agreement between our @xmath4 estimates and the values reported in the literature , including those in @xcite .",
    "@xcite explored possible patterns in the rotation of m and l dwarfs as a function of spectral type in an effort to better understand the evolution of the angular momentum of ucds as they age .",
    "the fact that both young and old l dwarfs are often rapid rotators indicates that their rotation differs from that of sun - like stars .",
    "more massive stars lose angular momentum through solar winds , slowing as they age , but older field l dwarfs still appear to be relatively rapid rotators compared to sun - like stars of similar ages .",
    "@xcite propose a braking mechanism that decreases in efficiency at the cooler atmospheric temperatures of ucds and is very inefficient in mid- to late - l dwarfs , where the deceleration timescales become comparable to the age of the universe . at the cool temperatures of ucds the stellar atmospheres are largely neutral , with few ions , reducing the strength of the coupling between the magnetic fields and the atmosphere and therefore reducing the strength of the braking mechanism .",
    "this model explains the lack of l dwarfs later than l3 found by @xcite to rotate slower than @xmath223  km s@xmath1 . in figure [ sptvvsin ]",
    "we show our projected rotational velocities against spectral type as determined from optical diagnostics , the same spectral types used by @xcite , along with other measurements from the literature .",
    "we also see some evidence for increasing @xmath4 for objects with spectral types later than l3 .",
    "we do , however , find four mid - l dwarfs that appear to be very slow rotators with @xmath224 km s@xmath1 : 2m0355 + 11 , 2m0500 + 03 , 2m0835 - 08 , and 2m1515 + 48 .",
    "the spectra of these l dwarfs , shown in figure [ slow ] , exhibit sharp , narrow co features indicative of slow rotation and their spectra are relatively well fit by our theoretical ucd models .",
    "the l6 dwarf 2m1515 + 48 also has a very large space velocity , a potential indicator of old age .",
    "the @xcite sample includes approximately 15 l dwarfs with spectral types later than l3 , comparable to our number .",
    "it is possible that these results are entirely consistent and that our slow rotators are simply observed close to pole - on . comparing our @xmath4 measurements to those from @xcite for objects with spectral types later",
    "than or equal to l4 with a two - sided k - s test indicates a probability of @xmath225 that the two samples are drawn from the same underlying distribution .    studying the kinematics of a population of stars , in particular their 3d motions ,",
    "is a powerful tool for understanding the age of that population as well as for identifying subgroups that may have distinct histories from the main population . as a result of gravitational interactions , the velocity dispersion of a population of stars",
    "is expected to increase with time as it orbits in the galaxy .",
    "models of ucds , and brown dwarfs in particular , have an inherent mass - age degeneracy that makes it difficult to differentiate between a old low - mass star and young brown dwarfs .",
    "this means that very few individual ucds have reliable age estimates . since ucds are intrinsically very faint , the relatively bright ucds we observe are necessarily close to the sun and most have reliable proper motion , and sometimes parallax , measurements . using these measurements , the statistical properties of the kinematics of the ucd population can be determined and the age of the population estimated using calibrated age - dispersion relations @xcite . @xcite present a analysis of the space velocities of 841 ucds .",
    "in this work the authors do not have rv information but rely on photometric distance estimates combined with proper motions to estimate the tangential velocity , @xmath226 . as pointed out by @xcite",
    "the analysis by @xcite applies the results from @xcite by assuming @xmath227 when in reality the dispersion of the total velocity must be determined from the dispersions of the individual velocity components .",
    "we combined our radial velocities with proper motion and parallax measurements from the literature and photometric distance estimates from @xcite to estimate the total space velocity , @xmath228 , as well as @xmath229 , @xmath230 , @xmath231 components following the transformation presented by @xcite .",
    "we followed the right handed convention ( positive @xmath229 is toward the galactic center ) and we did not apply a correction to the local standard of rest .",
    "the distribution of @xmath232 for 55 of our targets with distance and proper motion estimates from the literature is shown in figure [ vtot ] and the velocity components are listed in table 10 .",
    "the distribution of @xmath228 is approximately gaussian with a significant tail of targets with @xmath233 km s@xmath1 . excluding these high velocity ucds we found that the average space velocity of the ucds in our sample is @xmath234 km s@xmath1 , similar to the mean l dwarf space velocity found by @xcite .",
    "we estimated the velocity dispersions of our sample in each velocity component using a bootstrap simulation taking into account the reported errors on all of the measured quantities used to calculate @xmath229 , @xmath230 , and @xmath231 .",
    "we calculated the @xmath235-weighted dispersions ( eqns . 1 - 3 in @xcite ) and estimated @xmath236 excluding the high velocity ucds . based on the results of the bootstrap simulation we estimated @xmath237 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we used eqn . 16 from @xcite ( eqn . 3 from @xcite ) to estimate the age of our sample to be @xmath5 gyr ( @xmath238 confidence )",
    "not including any systematic uncertainty in the age - dispersion relation .",
    "this age is somewhat larger than the 3.1 gyr estimated by @xcite for their sample of m7-m9.5 dwarfs , though they conclude that @xmath14 of their objects are actually young brown dwarfs .",
    "our sample of mainly l dwarfs is lower in mass and may have less contamination from young objects , possbily contributing to the differences in the estimated ages of our two samples .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with those of @xcite who used a similar method to estimate the age for a sample of 43 l dwarfs .",
    "they also estimate the kinematic age of their sample to be approximately 5 gyr and discuss the impliciations of this result .",
    "since nearby m dwarfs appear to have an age of approximately 3 gyr it is surprising that early l dwarfs , which , if below the hydrogen burning mass limit , will dim substanitally and move to later spectral types as they age , should be found to be older than m dwarfs .",
    "possibly explanations for this proposed by @xcite include different initial velocity dispersions for m and l dwarfs , the influence of kinematic outliers in the estimation of the velocitiy dispersions , and non - gaussianity in the velocity distributions .",
    "the high velocity ucds that we excluded from the @xmath228 analysis are themselves potentially very interesting",
    ". objects with high velocities may be subdwarfs from an older , lower - metallicity thick disk or halo population .",
    "in addition to lsr1610 we identified eight l dwarfs with @xmath233 km s@xmath1 listed in table 11 .",
    "lsr1610 was one of the first known low - mass subdwarfs , and its @xmath173 km s@xmath1 exceeds all of the rest of the objects in our sample and based on its velocity components it is considered to be a member of the halo population . in figure",
    "[ thin ] we compare the estimated uvw velocities to velocity ellipsoids for the thin disk and thick disk populations . while the majority of the ucds in our sample have kinematics consistent with the local thin disk population , seven have large negative v velocities , falling outside the @xmath239 velocity ellipsoid for the thin disk ( @xmath240 km s@xmath1 ) , making them candidates for membership in the older thick disk population .",
    "thanks mainly to direct imaging surveys , we now know that the population of ucd binaries has several significant differences from that of binaries composed of sun - like stars .",
    "these differences are summarized in @xcite and @xcite : @xmath241 ucd binaries tend to have mass ratios @xmath21 compared to @xmath242 for sun - like stars , @xmath243 there are very few ucd binaries with @xmath244 au , @xmath245 for ucds the distribution of binary separation peaks around @xmath22 au compared to @xmath246 au for sun - like stars , @xmath247 the overall fraction of binaries is @xmath248 for ucds compared to @xmath249 for sun - like stars . using a bayesian approach that assumes a parameterized underlying distribution for the properties of ucd binary systems , @xcite estimated that there is likely a small but significant population of small separation ( @xmath6 au ) ucd binaries that are not detected by imaging surveys or the rv surveys that have been conducted to date .",
    "systematic rv surveys like our nirspec survey are important for constraining the binary fraction in this part of parameter space . an equal - mass ucd binary ( @xmath250m@xmath251 ) with an average separation of @xmath252 au",
    "has an orbital period of 7 years and an rv semi - amplitude @xmath253 km s@xmath1 , potentially detectable in our survey .",
    "we carried out a monte carlo simulation to estimate how efficiently our survey detects tight binaries and the overall rate of such systems .    for our simulation we used a sub - sample of 40 targets from our survey meeting the following criteria : @xmath254 , not a known binary , not a known subdwarf , observations on two or more epochs , and total time span of observations more then 350 days .",
    "our simulation is similar in nature to the simulations of @xcite , though we made some simplifying assumptions . using the actual times of observations of these 40 targets , as well as the actual rv error estimates for each observation",
    ", we generated @xmath255 hypothetical surveys where each of the 40 targets is a tight binary .",
    "for the mass ratio , @xmath125 , we used a power - law distribution with exponent @xmath256 @xcite .",
    "we assumed that each of our ucds has a mass of @xmath257 and used a uniform distribution in @xmath258 between @xmath259 and @xmath260 au to calculate spectroscopic binary orbits with random phase , argument of periapsis , @xmath127 , and inclination .",
    "we assumed a distribution of eccentricity that is uniform between @xmath261 and @xmath262 .",
    "we generated synthetic data based on the binary orbits , the actual times of the nirspec observations , and adding noise based on the scaled error estimates at each epoch , @xmath79 .",
    "since we have already adjusted our empirical error estimates so that they are a good description of the overall statistical properties of our data , we feel that a synthetic data set generated in this way is a fair representation of a potential survey .",
    "we excluded epochs after april , 2009 since these observations were primarily for follow - up of suspected binary systems . to estimate the efficiency with which such systems would have been detected in our survey we counted the number of binary systems detected in each simulated survey with a conservative requirement that @xmath263 to qualify as a detection .",
    "based on these simulations we estimated that our overall average efficiency in detecting systems with @xmath264 au is @xmath265 .",
    "we found that this efficiency is relatively insensitive to the assumed mass of the primary and , since it is peaked near 1.0 , the assumed mass ratio distribution .",
    "our survey contains 43 targets that would have been included in the sample based on the above criteria alone and assuming that none of these systems passed the magnitude cut because they are unknown binaries . within this sample we found one definite tight sb1 system ( 2m0320@xmath304 ) and one possible sb1 system ( 2m1507@xmath316 ) , though",
    "if this system is a genuine sb1 then the separation may be larger than @xmath252 au .",
    "the system 2m0746 + 20 was a known astrometric binary , with @xmath16au , and lsr1610@xmath30040 and lsr0602 + 39 were known subdwarfs .",
    "based on the estimated detection efficiency , a flat prior on the binary fraction , and the detection of 1 ( possibly 2 ) tight binaries , we use the binomial distribution to make a bayesian estimate of the fraction of late - m and l dwarf systems in tight binaries ( @xmath266 confidence ) of @xmath7 ( @xmath267 ) .",
    "while our sample is small and the number of detected tight binaries is small , our observations are consistent with the overall binary properties from @xcite and in particular with the prediction that @xmath268 of ucds are in binaries with @xmath6 au . assuming similar underlying statistical distributions to the ones we used here , @xcite combined radial velocity observations from the literature and found a relatively large number of close binaries , requiring an overall binary fraction of @xmath269 , approximately a factor of two higher than those from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "while our results are consistent with the lower overall binary fraction , our current constraint does not rule out the higher value .      for at least four reasons , ucds are excellent targets for planet searches",
    "@xmath270 : the semi - amplitude of the doppler signal , @xmath112 , increases inversely with the mass of the host star ( @xmath271 ) for a fixed orbital period and planetary mass .",
    "if the level of doppler precision achieved for f - g - k dwarfs can be achieved for ucds , then it becomes possible , in principle , to detect super - earth planets in the so called habitable zone ( hz ) , where in the absence of an atmosphere the equilibrium temperature of a planet is in the liquid water range .",
    "@xmath272 : ucds have low luminosities compared to sun - like stars , meaning that the hz moves closer in to the host , serving to boost the doppler signal of a planet of fixed mass beyond the gain from the decrease in the mass of the primary .",

    "a significant population of giant planets orbiting close to m and l dwarfs is not predicted by models of planet formation via core accretion ( i.e. @xcite ) , though such planets may be formed in the disk instability scenario @xcite .",
    "@xmath274 : the ratio of the intrinsic brightness of a planet to its host at thermal infrared wavelengths is orders of magnitude larger when that host is a ucd rather than a sun - like star .",
    "the relative proximity to the sun of the brightest ucds that we observe also means that planetary companions will have relatively large angular separations on the sky .",
    "favorable contrast ratios and angular separations mean that planetary companions to ucds will likely be among the best targets for efforts to directly image and study the atmospheres of extrasolar planets at infrared and mid - infrared wavelengths using high contrast imaging techniques .",
    "we ran a monte carlo simulation to estimate our ability to detect binary systems with small mass ratios ( @xmath275 ) and orbital separations @xmath264 au .",

    "we followed a similar procedure to that described previously in this section to generate @xmath255 realization of our survey and inserted spectroscopic orbits with random inclinations into the synthetic data and counted detections using the same @xmath263 criteria .",

    "we found that for small orbital separations , similar to those of the hot jupiters found orbiting sun - like stars ( @xmath280 au ) , our survey is very sensitive to giant planets ( @xmath281 m@xmath279 ) and the least massive brown dwarfs .",
    "based on the average detection efficiencies , @xmath282 , shown in figure [ planet ] , we estimate the following upper limits ( @xmath238 ) for the rate of planetary companions , @xmath283 , at orbital separations @xmath284  au : for 1m@xmath279 , @xmath285 , for 2m@xmath279 , @xmath286 , for 5m@xmath279 , @xmath287 , for 10m@xmath279 , @xmath288 .",
