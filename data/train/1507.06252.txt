    "metamaterial research in the past decade offered an entirely new route to further enhance our capability to engineer material properties at will . here , metamaterials are artificially fabricated structures ( often periodic , _",
    "i.e. _ , crystalline ) which are designed so that they exhibit wave properties not observed with common materials , _ e.g. _ , they can , in theory , bend electromagnetic @xcite , acoustic @xcite , and even surface gravity waves @xcite so as to achieve sub - wavelength focusing @xcite , create cloaks @xcite , and attain shielding @xcite .",
    "other unexpected properties include artificial magnetism @xcite , negative permeability @xcite , negative refraction index @xcite , and hyperbolic dispersion @xcite , to name a few .",
    "such materials have allowed us to gain unprecedented control over a range of electromagnetic / optical and acoustic wave phenomena . in many ways metamaterials",
    "parallel the development of photonic and phononic crystals ( optical and acoustic analogues of semiconductors ) which also rely on small - scale structures for their properties .",
    "however , the major difference lies in the sub - wavelength nature of metamaterial structure .",
    "this enables us to summarize their properties in terms of permittivity and permeability @xmath0 for electromagnetic waves , or bulk modulus and mass density @xmath1 for acoustic waves , just as we would for any naturally occurring material .",
    "this is an enormous simplification for the design process , and research is now focusing on the realization of a new generation of metadevices @xcite  with novel and useful functionalities achieved by the structuring of functional matter on the sub - wavelength scale .",
    "novel devices such as superlens @xcite , hyperlens @xcite , invisibility cloaks @xcite , and plasmonic waveguides @xcite  have been fabricated and tested in the past few years .",
    "the technology behind such metadevices is fairly well established in the _ low - frequency _ regime where inclusions have sizes much smaller than the wavelength of operation . at these relatively low frequencies this",
    "is commonly obtained by assuming only monopole and/or dipole interactions , _",
    "e.g. _ , by utilizing conducting materials shaped as dipoles @xcite  and split - ring resonators @xcite .",
    "the existence of resonances poses a considerable challenge to classical effective medium theories .",
    "this is because their basic principle is to minimize the scattering in the quasi - static limit , while the local resonances occur most often at longer wavelengths .    here",
    ", following these concepts , we develop and analyse a",
    "_ _ supra__-classical dynamic model of metamaterial response .",
    "there is an abundance of miscellaneous effective medium theories @xcite , some quite recent @xcite ; many of these works claim to be valid not only in the quasi - static limit but also at finite frequencies _ beyond _ the long - wavelength limit : a situation that happens when the wavelength @xmath2 is long in the host medium , while the wavelength in the particles , @xmath3 , can be small .",
    "( this is in contrast to the quasi - static limit where both @xmath2 and @xmath3 should be much larger than the size of the particles . )",
    "such extension to finite frequencies is sometimes denoted as the dynamic effective medium theory . however , even this _ dynamic _ approximation relies exclusively on the monopolar and dipolar response of the scattering objects , which implicitly assumes long wavelengths . in this paper , this restriction is relaxed and the full effect of the ensemble of particles that constitute the effective medium is included , as higher diffraction orders are encompassed .",
    "this will allow the design of new metadevices working over a wider wavelength range .",
    "we shall illustrate this by solving a simple scalar problem in two dimensions , having applications not only in electromagnetics but also in acoustics and elasticity .",
    "the similarities between the equations of acoustics , elasticity and electromagnetics allow us to use some of the same techniques to solve problems in these seemingly disparate fields .",
    "the theoretical approach to the field of metamaterials is provided through dynamic homogenization techniques which relate the microstructure of a composite to the frequency dependence of its effective properties .",
    "the majority of research interest in the area of metamaterials is restricted to _ periodic _",
    "microstructures @xcite ( as the arrangement of molecules according to solid - state physics ) which admit bloch ( or floquet ) waves  as solutions and many different numerical algorithms have been developed ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) for calculating the dispersive properties of these waves .",
    "a popular route to determining these parameters is by the use of retrieval methods @xcite where the assumption is that local effective properties may be used to define periodic composites .",
    "the retrieval method leads to the refractive index @xmath4 and the wave impedance @xmath5 , which defines the reflectivity of a semi - infinite slab .",
    "however , while simple in principle , such retrieval methods are limited to ordered arrays and often produce ambiguous results due to oversimplified initial assumptions of the bulk model @xcite .",
    "certainly engineers like structures and designs that follow some type of order .",
    "however , materials may be also amorphous and isotropic , and natural materials on the macroscopic level are quite often _ random _ in essence",
    ". it may well be that a random placement of complex particles would be enough to produce emergent properties in the overall wave response and therefore give us a sample of metamaterial @xcite .",
    "the effective behaviour of metamaterials whose microstructure is random depends strongly on the governing statistics of the random distribution .",
    "effective properties may be determined by using the self - consistent _ effective medium _",
    "methods for which a substantial body of literature may be found . although variants exist , these methods often consider the scattering problem of a coated particle embedded in a matrix which has the properties of the effective media .",
    "these properties are then determined by requiring the vanishing of the effective forward - scattering amplitude @xmath6  and as such are formally restricted to the low - frequency and long - wavelength ranges . for examples where this method has been applied to electromagnetic , acoustic and elastic waves , see @xcite . although the above self - consistent condition ( @xmath7 ) is physically sufficient to describe the effective medium , two effective properties , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath8 , can not be determined ` simultaneously and uniquely ' from the single condition .",
    "a supplementary condition is needed ; this prevents the application of effective medium methods to finding dynamic effective properties .",
    "note however that the above condition is sufficient for wave propagation in a metamaterial in which a single material constant is involved , _",
    "e.g. _ in dielectric media .",
    "another deficiency of many current enhancements of the effective medium methods is their failure to describe the influence of the spatial distribution of particles on the effective constitutive parameters .",
    "such a description is possible in the framework of a self - consistent scheme called the _ effective field _",
    "method @xcite  and our work is within the framework of this scheme .",
    "one of the principal results of the effective field approach was an adequate definition of the coherent wave and a proof that it obeys a wave equation , _",
    "i.e. _ , a proof that , under certain conditions , a random distribution of scatterers can , for this purpose , be represented by an effective medium @xcite .",
    "most calculations proceed by assuming the existence of such an effective medium equation .",
    "the subject of the present work is the macroscopic dynamic behaviour of the above composite medium , _",
    "i.e. _ , random distribution of particles .",
    "more precisely , we shall describe a heuristic scheme for evaluating the effective properties of metamaterials .",
    "the approach is based on the idea that a certain effective field acts on each particle , as a consequence of the presence of the other particles ; hence , the name _ effective field _",
    "method__. _ _ the framework we develop is based on the fikioris - waterman @xcite and waterman - pedersen @xcite  formalism to evaluate the coherent wave motion on both sides of a semi - infinite array of particles . in the dynamic range .",
    "the authors have also predicted negative frequency - dependent @xmath9 at single - particle resonances although the plots only displayed the positive values .",
    "in fact , they only noted that _ the effective parameters vanish or diverge at certain frequencies _  without further comment , which suggests that the results were considered curious at that time .",
    "currently it is common to have negative effective parameters , and much research on metamaterials is focused on this area . ]",
    "more specifically , we consider an averaged wave motion , where all possible configurations of particles are weighted by appropriate pair - correlation functions .",
    "in contrast to the effective medium methods , we derive a fully dynamic model for the effective constitutive parameters , which retains all the relevant information ( particle geometry and physical parameters )  provided by an expanded multipole solution . as a result ,",
    "the theory discussed in the following is more complete and potentially more useful than previous approaches to derive effective material parameters .",
    "here , we consider two specific polarizations in electromagnetism , transverse electric ( te ) and transverse magnetic ( tm ) . in addition , parallel to the electromagnetic example is the mathematically identical case of acoustics and anti - plane elasticity .",
    "we then consider these as two dimensional problems . indeed , exploiting the physics common to many types of wave propagation , the idea of metamaterials has been implemented successfully for acoustic and elastic waves .",
    "many of the conclusions drawn from photonics research directly apply to acoustic waves and acoustic metamaterials due to the essential similarity of the governing equations in the two cases . realizing analogous results for elastic metamaterials",
    "is complicated by the fact that the governing equation for elasticity admits both longitudinal and shear wave solutions which are capable of exchanging energy between each other .",
    "however , anti - plane elasticity is a special state of deformation with just a single non - zero displacement field , similar to transverse electromagnetics .",
    "the governing equation common to electromagnetics , acoustics , and linear anti - plane elasticity is detailed in appendix a.    effective constitutive parameters depend on many factors including the intrinsic properties of the particles and the host matrix , their shape and topology .",
    "the latter determines how the particles are distributed in the matrix .",
    "the system considered in our study is composed of two isotropic phases : cylindrical particles of arbitrary shape randomly distributed in a host medium with propagation constant @xmath10 for some ( possibly complex ) parameters ( @xmath11 )  of the medium .",
    "depending on the application , these material parameters could be , _",
    "e.g. _ , compliance ( @xmath12 ) and density ( @xmath13 ) for shear horizontal polarized elastic waves or permittivity ( @xmath14 )  and permeability ( @xmath15 ) in electromagnetism ; a number of useful relationships among these parameters are summarized in table i.    in appendix b , we briefly review the effective field method .",
    "subject to the quasi - crystalline approximation , two equations are obtained for which the effective wavenumber @xmath16 of some coherent wave motion ( either electromagnetic , acoustic , or elastic ) and the effective impedance @xmath5 , are given in implicit form .",
    "note that , whereas the dispersion relation for @xmath16 is polarization - independent , the effective impedance depends on the type of the incident wave .",
    "these equations are the starting point of all further developments .",
    "observe that the particles have a size distribution and their relative positions are described by an arbitrary _ cross - pair _ distribution function @xmath17 .",
    "also , the size distribution is represented by @xmath18 ; here @xmath19 is the radius of the circular surface  circumscribing a particle , and @xmath20 is the number of particles per unit area .    without loss of generality ,",
    "we next assume the particles are identical and have equal sizes @xmath21 . here",
    ", we refer only to the final explicit solutions for the effective parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which are expressed elegantly as @xmath24@xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the scalar coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 are given in matrix notation by    [ meeff]@xmath29   , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and    [ deeff]@xmath30   .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one can easily check that these equations are compatible when @xmath31 . incidentally , we obtain @xmath32 , which is , as expected , the second order expansion in @xmath33 of the implicit wavenumber equation .",
    "note that all notations appearing in eqs . and",
    "are introduced in the appendix .",
    "results in classical multiple scattering theories are usually defined in terms of the _ angular shape function _",
    "@xmath34 for scattering of a plane wave by a single particle .",
    "it is useful to render yet another form of the coefficients and in terms of @xmath34 .",
    "this is done by considering the line - like approximation : in addition to @xmath35 , we also require @xmath36 . to render the results more tractable , the spatial distribution of particles is assumed to be isotropic and homogeneous , for which @xmath37 .",

    "it is noteworthy that if one wants to study the behaviour of effective parameters at high concentrations ( where such expansions may not be valid ) the general implicit equations detailed in appendix b should be used and/or more accurate pair correlation functions should be considered .",
    "neither incident wave nor boundary conditions have entered yet in the above description . consequently , the results admit several solutions corresponding to different polarization states . in ref .",
    "@xcite ( section  s1 ) , the expansions and [ or and ] are specialized to electromagnetic , acoustic , and elastic scattering for long wavelengths ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "this provides an additional check on the correctness of the results obtained in this paper .",
    "a further check on the consistency of our method is provided in ref .",
    "@xcite ( section s2 ) .",
    "it is shown that the quasi - crystalline approximation is _ self - consistent _ and identical to coherent potential approximation @xcite  at least to second order in concentration , provided the effective parameters are identified as those derived in this section .",
    "while the limiting cases considered in ref .",
    "@xcite ( section s1 ) perform a check of the theory we have presented , they neglect some important features of the effective field method .",
    "therefore , we address this problem numerically in order to illustrate the dynamic behaviour of the effective parameters . in the following , the effective parameters @xmath50 are calculated by using eqs . and , together with the percus - yevick pair - correlation function for hard disks @xcite .",
    "we consider a fibre bundle ( or circular cluster of dielectric fibres with @xmath51 ) of effective radius @xmath52 in vacuum .",
    "a plane electromagnetic wave is incident on the fibre bundle .",
    "a sketch is shown in figure 1 .",
    "there are @xmath53 circular fibres each of radius @xmath54 randomly distributed in the cluster and their volume fraction is @xmath55 .",
    "the refractive index of the fibres is @xmath56(@xmath57)@xmath58 exact multiple scattering simulations are compared with the effective medium model ( _ i.e. _ equivalent homogeneous magneto - dielectric inclusion at finite frequencies ( different from that in vacuum ) in a system in which both the matrix and the particles are non - magnetic . ] with effective parameters @xmath8 ) .",
    "the multiple scattering results are averaged over different realizations of the fibres locations . with @xmath59 realizations ,",
    "the maximum error between the numerical model and the effective medium results is less that @xmath60 , for the two cases illustrated .",
    "figures 2 and 3 show the spatial maps of the near - field electric field amplitude @xmath61 for two different incident wavelengths , @xmath62 and @xmath63 , respectively .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the response of the coherent wave regarding the topology of the fibre - bundle .",
    "as expected , the waves are insensitive to the relative locations of the fibres for long wavelengths .",
    "this is not the same for shorter wavelengths .",
    "a comparison of the results in figure 3 indicates the agreement is excellent even for the high frequency case considered ( @xmath64 ) .",
    "it is particularly encouraging that the agreement is excellent even inside the circular cluster .",
    "observe that the a regular arrangement of fibres produces a result that is closer to the effective cluster for long wavelengths , than is the result obtained with a random realization of the fibres locations .",
    "we should note that although the comparison in fig .",
    "3 is excellent , it may not always be so for other geometries of the fibre bundle . in a final section we detail various limitations and assumptions of our model and discuss",

    "it is of considerable interest to discuss the possibility of realizing anisotropic metamaterials , that is , the  material parameters are not scalars but tensors , with their principle components taking different values .",
    "different from the anisotropy property of the material itself , we shall examine anisotropy originating from geometric asymmetry and consider a random array of elliptic cylinders of material parameters ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "the @xmath66- and @xmath67-axes are set in the directions of the semi - minor and semi - major axes of the elliptic cylinders , with respective radii @xmath68 and @xmath69 . due to the geometric arrangement of the elliptic cylinders and the symmetry of the scattered fields ,",
    "the @xmath66- and @xmath67-directions can therefore be seen as effective principal directions .",

    "@xcite , section s1 ) , and @xmath79 .",
    "the results of eqs . -",
    "show that only the effective property @xmath80 is a tensor with principal components @xmath81 and @xmath82 , whereas @xmath23 is a scalar .",
    "this is consistent with results obtained recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , for electromagnetic waves in the quasi - static limit . however , these results should be consumed with prudence .",
    "we show that , in general , both @xmath80 and @xmath83 are tensors for arbitrary frequency and wavelength . to see this more clearly ,",
    "let us consider the scattering of a tm wave by perfect electric conductive elliptic cylinders in vacuum . from table",

    "the figure is intended to illustrate the variations of @xmath94 and @xmath95 as the wavelength @xmath96 varies on the horizontal axis , for several aspect ratios @xmath92 ; here , @xmath97 is the geometric mean of the semi - minor and semi - major axes , @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "observe that in the quasi - static limit , for @xmath98 , where currently available model will be adequate , the principal components of @xmath88 are visibly equal , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath99 , regardless of the ratio @xmath92 .",
    "this is as expected , given eq . .",
    "it is interesting that for shorter wavelengths ( @xmath100 ) , @xmath101 and @xmath102 become increasingly distinct as the ratio @xmath92 decreases from @xmath103 to @xmath104 , an effect not predicted by the existing literature .",
    "this suggests a new route to the design of metamaterials with controllable anisotropic effective properties .",

    "the results in figures 2 and 3 support the reliability of the effective material parameters resulting form the _ supra_-classical dynamic homogenization procedure reported here .",
    "note however that , although not apparent in the results , there is an approximation involved in replacing a finite - size heterogeneous composite with its homogenized equivalent , in addition to the reliability of the homogenization procedure ( which ignores transition region complications at the interface @xmath111 @xcite ) . in practical terms , it means that for a finite sample of the random composite the applicability of dynamic homogenization not only depends upon the frequency under consideration but also upon the phase of the composite at the boundary of the sample .",
    "an effort to quantify such an approximation is described in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", the approximation results from truncating interfaces of a finite ( or semi - infinite ) 1-d periodic composite , the later being replaced with what are essentially its effective dynamic properties in the infinite bloch - wave domain .",
    "other questions will need to be answered relating to the shape and size of the scattering boundary , the effect of increasing the number of particles , and how many realizations are required to determine both the near- and far - fields accurately .",
    "it is expected that as the bounded area increases , so does the uncertainty of the calculated field .",
    "an investigation in this direction is beyond the scope of the paper , however we refer the reader to the comprehensive numerical analysis ( based on the quasi - crystalline approximation ) reported in refs .",
    "the later references should come with a warning , as their analysis contains the implicit ( and incorrect @xcite ) assumption that the dielectric permittivity is the only quantity of interest .    finally , let us note that the effective material parameters derived in here ( which are tensor values for anisotropic media ) are not necessarily tied to the physical material parameters of any of the individual elements of the metamaterial .",
    "a rather critical survey discussing the link and the difference between these two concepts ( _ i.e. _ effective _ versus _ characteristic material parameters ) , particularly for the case of maxwell s equations , is presented in ref .",
    "as evidenced in this survey and references therein , homogenization theories continue to attract attention and even controversy .",
    "it appears , from considering exact reflection coefficients at oblique incidence ( if one assumes that fresnel - like formulae are always valid ) , that any effective material parameters that can be introduced in any theory would depend on the angle of incidence ; broadly speaking , they would depend on the type of illumination .",
    "this means that these effective properties do not necessarily relate solely to the bulk properties of the material itself ; they can involve the material and the type of illumination .",
    "relevant considerations in this direction are presented for periodic composites in refs .",
    "a retrieval method extended to the arbitrary orientations of the principal axes of anisotropy and oblique incidence was presented in ref .",
    "a discussion regarding modelling of the coherent wave propagation from the knowledge of the material properties along the principal axes only is elaborated in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to summarize , a self - consistent multiple scattering approach , which enables the dynamic homogenization of metamaterials in two dimensions is developed .",
    "the quasi - crystalline approximation is employed to break the hierarchy of increasing conditional probability densities , but otherwise the treatment is exact . in particular , the effective wavenumber and the effective impedance is obtained .",
    "these characteristics can then be used to determine the effective constitutive parameters of the homogenised material .",
    "whether the resulting effective parameters represent a true bulk property of the metamaterial in the dynamic range is yet to be determined .",
    "the two natural approximations - dilute media and low frequency approximations - show consistency , and , moreover , the quasi - static limit gives results reminiscent of the laws of maxwell garnett @xcite , ament @xcite , and kuster and toksz @xcite , respectively for electromagnetic , acoustic , and elastic material parameters ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , section s1 , for more details ) . the entire analysis described in this work",
    "is germane for alternative analytical procedures based on other scattering operators @xmath112  for an isolated particle .",
    "as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite ( section s2 ) , a fully self - consistent procedure may be based on a new kind of isolated scatterer problem .",
    "we have shown that the coherent potential approximation , used in many previous works , is only an approximation of this procedure to the first order in the concentration of particles .",
    "the theory provided here offers exciting opportunities for researchers in different communities , ranging from seismic waves to the entire field of ultrasound research , and spanning radio frequency and optical engineering .",
    "in particular , metamaterial modelling in optics , physical acoustics , and condensed matter physics may benefit from a rigorous , compact model for estimating more accurate and anisotropic effective medium parameters that homogenize artificial media .",
    "the numerical results were obtained using the computational facilities of the advanced computing research centre , university of bristol - http://www.bris.ac.uk / acrc/.",
    "there are many examples of wave equations in the physical sciences , characterized by oscillating solutions that propagate through space and time while , in lossless media , conserving energy .",
    "examples include the scalar wave equation ( _ e.g. _ , pressure waves in a gas ) , maxwell s equations ( electromagnetism ) , schrdinger s equation ( quantum mechanics ) , elastic vibrations , and so on . from a mathematical viewpoint , all of these share certain common features . in the following",
    ", we shall briefly identify the similarities between three types of such waves , in two dimensions : electromagnetic waves , anti - plane elastic waves , and acoustic waves .",
    "electromagnetic waves are quite different from acoustic and elastic waves in that they can travel through vacuum .",
    "however , from an algebraic perspective , all three types of waves can be described by a unique scalar equation and hence these disparate phenomena can be studied simultaneously .",
    "the prototype problem consists of the wave equation at fixed angular frequency @xmath113 @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the phase velocity of the wave for some parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 of the medium . in the above",
    ", the scalar wavefunction @xmath118 corresponds to some physical field .",
    "the problem considered here is reduced to points in the @xmath66-@xmath67 plane ( _ i.e. _ the cross section plane of our scattering geometry ) , which in polar coordinates are @xmath119 ; here , @xmath120 is measured from the positive @xmath66-axis .",
    "let us first consider the two important modes for electromagnetic wave propagation : the transverse electric field and the transverse magnetic field .",
    "these modes are closely analogous to anti - plane shear in elastodynamics and to acoustic waves .",
    "let us assume the medium is isotropic and has dielectric permittivity @xmath14 and magnetic permeability @xmath15 that are independent of @xmath121 a transverse magnetic ( tm ) field is a special solution of the maxwell s equations that has the form @xmath122 , and the electrical field @xmath123 a transverse electric ( te ) field is another special solution of the maxwell s equations that has the form @xmath124 , whereby the magnetic field is given by @xmath125 observe that simple knowledge of the scalar wavefunction @xmath126 suffices for the determination of the @xmath66 and @xmath67 components of the electric and magnetic fields , for the two polarizations .",
    "hence , eq .",
    "is the governing wave equation for electromagnetic waves provided that @xmath127 for tm waves , and @xmath128 for te waves .",
    "the general solution independent of @xmath129 is a superposition of the te and tm solutions .",
    "this can be seen by observing that the maxwell s equations decouple under this condition and a general solution can be written as @xmath130 , where the second term represents the tm solution .",
    "the first term is of course the te solution because @xmath131 , which implies @xmath132 as expected .",
    "let us now consider the case of anti - plane shear strain which is a special state of deformation where the displacement field is given by @xmath133 this is an out - of - plane mode of deformation and is analogous to transverse electromagnetic wave propagation . in the linear regime ,",
    "an isotropic elastic medium is characterized by its density @xmath13 and the lam elastic constants @xmath134 and @xmath135 : @xmath136 is the shear modulus ( notation used to distinguish from the permeability @xmath15 employed in electromagnetics ) and @xmath137 @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the two dimensional bulk modulus .",
    "hence , eq .  is the wave equation for anti - plane shear provided that @xmath140 .",
    "shear waves that satisfy this equation are also called sh ( shear horizontal ) waves , particularly in seismology .",
    "finally , let us consider the acoustic wave propagation in an isotropic medium .",
    "for an inviscid fluid or gas , the shear modulus @xmath136 is zero  and @xmath135 is just the bulk modulus . in this case , replacing @xmath126 with the pressure @xmath141 , we obtain precisely the acoustic wave equation  for p ( or compressional ) waves if @xmath142 .",
    "suppose that discrete particles of cylindrical geometry are randomly and uniformly distributed in a half - space defined by @xmath143 .",
    "the particles need not be circular , provided that each of them can be contained in a circumscribing circular surface of radius @xmath19 ( with an axis of revolution parallel to the @xmath129-axis ) ; their number density is @xmath144 .",
