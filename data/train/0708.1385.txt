    "_ testing the indistinguishability of four - photon state .",
    "_ the experiment shown in figure 2 was performed to confirm that the pair of two photons generated from our source was @xmath24 and not @xmath82 .",
    "the point here is that the probability of detecting two photons in each output of the beam splitter differs for those two input states .",
    "the genuine @xmath24 state will show the probability of 1/4 , and the state @xmath82 will show the probability of 1/2 . in both cases ,",
    "a pair of input states ( @xmath83 or @xmath84 ) have to be incident to the beam splitter at exactly the same time , i.e. , delay time @xmath85 .",
    "this is the reason why the probabilities at @xmath85 is essential for distinguishing those two states .    in the experiment , it is more convenient if we have a ` standard probability ' to which we can compare those probabilities .",
    "the probability where no quantum interference occurs among those four photons serves as such a standard .",
    "the probability is @xmath86 , which can be given by the classical probability to have two out of 4 with 1/2 probability , @xmath87 .",
    "this situation is realized experimentally by putting two photons in mode a and mode b at different timing , i.e. the path length difference is much more than the spatial distribution of the photonic wave functions ( about @xmath88 determined by the filter bandwidth of 4 nm ) .",
    "this provability @xmath86 is the same for both input states @xmath48 and @xmath89 , which is why it serves as a reference standard .",
    "this is the reason why the coincidence counts at delay time @xmath90 is also important .",
    "the reason why the probability is 1/4 for the @xmath24 input is easily found in eq . ( 1 ) of the manuscript : the square of the coefficient of the @xmath48 state at the output of the beamsplitter ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) ) is 1/4 . for @xmath91 input ,",
    "the state is converted by a 50:50 beam splitter as follows :      among the four possible four output states , the output states where two photons are found in both mode c and mode d are @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "thus , the probability to measure two photons in each output mode c and d is @xmath95 .    in summary , we can check if the state is @xmath24 or @xmath82 by comparing the four - fold coincidence count rate c(@xmath96 ) and c(@xmath90 ) .",
    "if c(@xmath96)/c(@xmath90)=2/3 ( 0.66 ) , it suggests that the initial state is @xmath24 . if c(@xmath96)/c(@xmath90)=4/3 ( 1.33 ) , the initial state is @xmath82 . if the output from the source is the mixture of those two states , the ratio is between 2/3 and 4/3 .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "2 that , c(@xmath96)/c(@xmath90 ) is almost 0.66 , indicating that our source generates almost purely @xmath24 ."

    "<S> this demonstrates that phase super - resolution by itself does not guarantee a quantum mechanical advantage . </S>",

    "<S> figure 3 shows the key experimental results of this paper . </S>",
    "<S> firstly we confirm the high visibility classical operation of our interferometer by inputing single photons in mode @xmath4 @xmath6 and detecting the rate of single photons measured in mode @xmath11 ; we observe an interference fringe with high visibility ( @xmath63 ) as a function of the optical phase in mode @xmath10 ( fig . </S>",

    "<S> 3b ) . this visibility is greater than the threshold to beat the sql ( @xmath65 ) . </S>",
    "<S> finally we input the state @xmath24 and observe the rate of detecting 3 photons in mode @xmath11 and 1 photon in mode @xmath22 , as described above ; again we see a high visibility fringe ( @xmath66 ) , now with a period four times smaller than that observed for single photons , demonstrating a four photon de broglie wavelength ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3c ) . </S>",
    "<S> more importantly the fringe visibility is greater than the threshold @xmath43 to beat the sql .    </S>",
    "<S> the distinction between a reduced de broglie wavelength ( phase super - resolution ) and beating the sql ( phase super - sensitivity ) has been described above . </S>",

    "<S> we have used exactly the same experimental setup as before , but have intentionally used distinguishable photon inputs ( see fig . 4 caption ) . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4c we use the input state @xmath54 , described above . in this case the probability of detecting 3 photons in mode @xmath11 and 1 in mode @xmath22 is given by @xmath71 , which still shows a @xmath72 dependence on phase . </S>",
    "<S> however , because the intinsic efficiency is @xmath73 , such a scheme can never show a phase sensitivity below the sql : @xmath74 . for fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4b the input is @xmath75 and the probability of detecting two photons in mode @xmath11 is @xmath76 , which shows a @xmath77 phase dependence , but again can not beat the sql since @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the reduced count rates in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4 ( b and c ) relative to fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ( b and c ) correspond to the reduced @xmath35 s    our results point towards the ultimate sensitivity for optical measurements . to test the performance of the four - photon interferometer </S>",
    "<S> , we used a relatively low efficiency source and modest efficiency detectors which means that many more photons pass through the interferometer than lead to a four - photon detection event . for applications ( such as biological sensing ) where photon flux is important higher efficiency sources </S>",
    "<S> might be realized using single photon sources and a hom interferometer as a heralded two - photon source , while high efficiency number resolving visible light photon counters@xcite would dramatically improve detection efficiency . </S>",
