    "liquids at solid - liquid interfaces behave differently from bulk liquids .",
    "interfacial phenomena play key roles in various applications like , for instance , heterogeneous catalysis , electrochemistry , adsorption and transport in porous media .",
    "it is our goal to improve the description of such interfaces at the microscopic scale .",
    "experimentally , specific techniques have been developed , such as the vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy  @xcite or quasi - elastic neutron scattering techniques  @xcite , that now give access to information on the structural and dynamic properties of the liquid on few molecular layers on top of the surface . at these scales , theoretical modeling can clarify experimental observations by linking them to atomistic phenomena .",
    "for instance , rotenberg _ _ et  al .  _",
    "_ @xcite showed by molecular simulations that wetting properties of talc surfaces , that behave as hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on the relative humidity , are a consequence of the competition between surface - solvent adhesion , favorable entropy in the gas phase and molecular cohesion in the liquid phase .",
    "this kind of theoretical modeling is typically based on molecular dynamics ( md ) or monte carlo simulations where each atom is considered individually . for systems that are intrinsically multiscale , e.g. porous media",
    ", one has to deal with thousands of atoms . at this point ,",
    "numerical heaviness becomes critical and hinders systematic studies . to overcome this difficulty , various mesoscale models",
    "have been proposed , that are less computationally demanding .",
    "one can for instance forget the molecular nature of the solvent to only account for a polarizable continuum medium ( pcm )  @xcite , or simplify it to a hard sphere , with or without dipole  @xcite .",
    "coarse - grained strategies have also been successfully applied to solid - liquid interfaces  @xcite .",
    "while these methods and others proved efficient on a panel of problems , the applicability of their underlying approximation to an unknown system remains to be carefully and systematically checked .    in the second half of the last century , liquid state theories  @xcite like the classical density functional theory ( dft )",
    "@xcite have blossomed .",
    "classical dft , like other methods such as integral equations or classical field theories have shown to give thermodynamic and structural results comparable to all - atom simulations at attractive numerical cost , but they have for now been limited to highly symmetric systems , bulk fluids or simple model interfaces , e.g. hard and soft walls .",
    "a current challenge lies in the development of three - dimensional theories and implementations to describe molecular liquids , solutions , mixtures , in complex environments such as biomolecular media or atomically - resolved surfaces and interfaces .",
    "recent developments in this direction use lattice field  @xcite , or gaussian field  @xcite theoretical approaches , or the 3d reference interaction site model ( 3d - rism )  @xcite , an appealing integral equation theory that has proven recently to be applicable to , e.g. , structure prediction in complex biomolecular systems .",
    "integral equations are , however , restricted by the choice of a closure relation ( typically hypernetted chain ( hnc ) , percus - yevick  @xcite , or kovalenko - hirata  @xcite approximation ) , and despite their great potential , they remain difficult to control and improve , and can prove difficult to converge .",
    "recently , a molecular density functional theory ( mdft ) approach to solvation has been introduced .",
    "@xcite it relies on the definition of a free - energy functional depending on the full six - dimensional position and orientation solvent density . in the so - called homogeneous reference fluid ( hrf ) approximation , the ( unknown ) functional can be inferred from the properties of the bulk solvent .",
    "compared to reference molecular dynamics calculations , such approximation was shown to be accurate for polar , non - protic fluids @xcite , but to require corrections for water@xcite . until now , only simple three - dimensional solutes have been considered in this framework including ions and polar@xcite or apolar  @xcite molecules . in ref .",

    "the hrf - mdft calculations allowed to accurately describe the subtle structure of the first molecular layers at the surface , in particular the orientational properties .",
    "the only noticeable difference lies in a localized zone of high density at the center of hexagons , a defect due to a small overestimation of the polarization close to the solute inherent to the method .",

    "the numerical efficiency of our approach made it possible to analyze the relative contributions of the clayff force field to the solvation properties .",
