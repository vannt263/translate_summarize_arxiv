    "supernova 1987a provides a uniquely detailed case for the study of the late evolution of massive stars with many surprising features .",
    "it is one of the very few sne in which the progenitor was studied before the explosion .",
    "the internal composition of the progenitor structure and that of the ejecta have been the subject of intense scrutiny . the sn environment is dominated by a mass - loss nebula ( or `` circumstellar envelope '' - cse ) with many different features capable of betraying various phases and events during the life of the progenitor . the cse can in turn be probed through its response to the ionizing flash from the sn explosion , followed by light echoes in the optical , followed by the collision with the cse of the ejecta from the explosion .",
    "we are studying the spatial structure of this nebula , as well as its velocity structure seen in narrow emission lines , in order to construct as complete as possible a history of the mass loss phases of the star . with both the velocity structure and the full three - dimensional spatial structure that light echoes reveal",
    ", one can interpret observations in terms of the kinematic ages and therefore the evolutionary phases involved in mass loss .",
    "we are presenting these observations in a series of works detailing the spatial structure of the inner cse ( paper i : crotts , kunkel & heathcote 1995 ) , its velocity structure ( this paper ) and the spatial structure of the outer cse ( in preparation ) .    while the velocity and distance from the sn of a feature yield a timescale characteristic of how long ago that material was ejected from the surface of the progenitor , these timescales can also be inferred more indirectly from compositional variations within the cse : structures arising at different times result from different layers of the star , and hence should have different compositions . detecting this level of differentiation across the cse",
    "requires the spatial resolution of @xmath1  fos spectra to compare the rings ( panagia et al .",
    "1996 ) , indicating much less nitrogen in the outer rings than the inner ring , suggesting that the outer rings were ejected some @xmath7  yr earlier than the inner rings whose kinematic age is @xmath8  yr ( crotts & heathcote 1991 ) .",
    "we shall here test this compositional age measure against the kinematic age of the outer ring , and attempt to explain possible discrepancies .",
    "this is a difficult observational problem best attacked through the combination of ground - based and @xmath1 measurements . over the entire central region where they are expected to show the largest variation in velocity ,",
    "the ors are found within only @xmath50.3 arcsec of the er , yet are many times fainter than the er . this situation cries out for the high angular resolution of @xmath1 , but also requires high spectral resolution ( preferably at least @xmath9 ) which is available on @xmath1 ( ghrs and stis / mama ) only in the uv for transitions in which the ors are too faint .",
    "such high spectral resolution is readily available in the optical from the ground , but seeing limits its usefulness to the portions of the ors separated from the er by more than about 1  arcsec . as we shall see",
    ", the @xmath10 , stis g750 m setup for [ n  ii]@xmath26583 can detect velocity offsets of some er and or features if sufficient care is taken . fortunately , for different segments of the ors , one or the other observational alternative offers some way of measuring their velocity , and for some these results can be intercompared .    to look at signals at different spatial scales and spectral resolutions , we used a total of four different kinds of data : from the ground ( ctio 4m / echelle ) , single - slit spectra to study the er and or features 1 - 2  arcsec from the er and multi - slit spectra to study fainter features at larger radii , and on @xmath1 , stis spectra of the er and or compared to wfpc2 images , the latter used to fix the angular positions of different features in the stis spectrograph slit relative to one another . to appreciate the relevance of each data set to the problem , it is helpful to see ( figure 1 ) the placement of the stis and ctio / echelle slits relative to the rings and adjacent stars .",
    "( `` nor '' and `` sor '' refer to the northern and southern or , respectively . )      the data used here , already described in sonneborn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) ( their figure 6 ) , were taken on ut 1997 apr 26 , day 3715 after core collapse .",
    "it was a 643s stis integration in the g750 m mode ( 6295 - 6867 , resolution @xmath11 1.02 , or 46.5  km  s@xmath4 at [ n  ii]@xmath12 ) .",
    "the 2  arcsec - wide longslit centered on the sn was oriented at pa@xmath13 , nearly parallel to the er s projected major axis , and hence included the entire er as well as much of the ors , including the segments which might be expected to be seen expanding most rapidly from the sn along the line of sight .    because of the wide spectrograph slit used the position of a feature along the dispersion axis depends on both its velocity and its position perpendicular to the slit .",
    "thus in order to measure velocities within the rings , we must compare their dispersed images seen in the stis spectra to their undispersed locus measured in wfpc2 images .",
    "for this purpose we have used an image through the narrow band f658n filter , which primarily admits flux in [ n  ii]@xmath26583 obtained on day 3478 ( go program 6437 , kirshner et al . ) which had a total exposure time of 5400s .",
    "the possible motion of the ring emission locus over this 237 day interval between the stis and wfpc2 observations should be negligible , less than 0.1 pixel ( c.f .",
    "plait et al .  1995 ) .",
    "these data were taken with the same setup used in crotts & heathcote ( 1991 ) , using the f/8 echelle spectrograph on the ctio 4 m , with the 31.6  l  mm@xmath4 echelle grating and kpgl3 cross - disperser ( 527  l  mm@xmath4 , blazed at 5500  in first order ) , which together deliver a resolving power @xmath14 ( corresponding to 7.5  km  s@xmath4 ) with the 1  arcsec slit used .",
    "we used the red , long - focus camera and red collimator , covering 5530 - 7050 .",
    "we concentrate primarily on the narrow emission line at [ n  ii]@xmath12 . for the slit decker used",
    ", each order is 19 arcsec wide .",
    "data such as these were taken on numerous occasions between 1989 and 1997 , and we chose the best of these , in terms of good seeing and signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath15 ) of the or features .",
    "those chosen were from ut 1996 dec 1 ( day 3569 after core collapse , shortly before the @xmath1 stis observation ) , and have seeing of about 0.8 arcsec fwhm .",
    "these data are described in xu & crotts ( 1999 ) .",
    "they employed the 79  l  mm@xmath4 echelle grating on the ctio 4m / echelle , along with an order separation filter that selected h@xmath16 and [ n  ii ] lines , projected through a set of five slits separated by 12.5  arcsec perpendicular to their length .",
    "the free velocity range of 120  km  s@xmath4 between successive slits was sufficient to prevent overlap of detectable lmc emission components .",
    "the data considered here were part of a 6@xmath176 arcmin raster of north - south slits roughly centered on the sn ( with one actually passing through the sn ) , with additional single , long slits oriented east - west in preliminary exposures to check that there were no observable components lying beyond the 120  km  s@xmath4 no - overlap range .",
    "these spectra have a velocity resolution of 10  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "exposures were obtained for 1  hour in each position , and up to five velocity components were disentangled from each spectrum , analyzed at each point on a grid with 13  arcsec sampling north - south and 12.5  arcsec east - west .",
    "these data were taken several years before the others , on days 2160 - 2162 .",
    "these four datasets are combined to map the velocity field of sn  1987a s cse .",
    "the ground - based data provides good measurements of the velocities of the ors north and south of the sn , which are missed by stis , but because of limited spatial resolution are less useful for the portions of the ors closer to the er , which stis covers well .",
    "the emission from the portion of the sky containing the outer cse , however , has too low an emission measure for @xmath1 to study easily , but is seen more easily by a telescope with a faster f - ratio . we consider each of these measurements in turn .",
    "the g750 m stis spectra of sonneborn et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , their figure 6 , show excellent images of the er and a portion of the nor and sor in [ n  ii]@xmath2@xmath26548 , 6583 and h@xmath16 ( as well as several other transitions ) taken on day 3715 , which can be compared to nearly contemporaneous images from wfpc2 . the [ n  ii]@xmath26583 line has by far the greatest @xmath15 ( with the h@xmath16 signal being smeared by thermal broadening . )",
    "the difference between the positions of features in the dispersed stis data compared to the direct wfpc2 image allows us to measure the relative velocities between different parts of the cse .",
    "unfortunately , the region of the nor seen within the er is largely obscured by the sn ejecta and in part by the blue - shifted smear of the `` hot spot '' ( sonneborn et al .",
    "1998 , michael et al .  1998 ) on the er overlapping the nor .",
    "nonetheless , the entire er and a large portion of the northern sor and southern nor can be compared between the stis and wfpc2 data in this way .",
    "figure 2 shows the results of the best bilinear fit of the g750 m stis locus of the er to the position of er from the day 3478 wfpc2 exposure with the f658n filter .",
    "the loci in each image are defined as the set of points of maximum brightness defined along radial crosscuts through the sn .",
    "( note that the scale in one dimension is expanded to make the er appear roughly circular . )",
    "this shows a close correspondence between the two loci with the stis points following the wfpc2 track , matching most features in great detail , to within an r.m.s .",
    "difference of 0.12 stis pixels .",
    "the anamorphic magnification of this stis mode at this wavelength ( bowers et al .",
    "1998 ) is 0.92786 ( compressed in the dispersion direction ) . in comparison ,",
    "the stis - to - wfpc2 fit requires a 0.91058 compression along the dispersion , corresponding to a difference in velocity of @xmath18 stis pixels , or @xmath19  between the northern and southern side of the er , in the sense that the southern side is redshifted .",
    "this implies a velocity shear of 14.3  km  s@xmath4 across the slit , which corresponds ( since the slit is well - aligned with the er ) to a radial expansion velocity i.e.  outward from the sn , of @xmath20  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "this is a new , independent measurement of the er expansion velocity , but it is in good agreement with some previous values ( 10.3  km  s@xmath4 : crotts & heathcote 1991 , cumming 1994 ) and is not far from others ( 11  km  s@xmath4 : panagia et al .  1996 , 8  km  s@xmath4 : meaburn et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "figure 3a shows the position of the stis and wfpc2 or signals after alignment of the er signals as in figure 2 .",
    "the residual offset of the sor and especially the nor is a clear sign of the velocity difference between the ors and the er centroid .",
    "intercalibrating the data in this way eliminates any possible sources of systematic error due to uncertainties in the standard stis and wfpc2 platescales , at the cost of only slightly increasing the random error due to the uncertainty of aligning the two er signals .",
    "the useful sample of the ors excludes those portions where they approach the er , and also where they run nearly parallel to the dispersion axis .",
    "additionally , the sor signal is corrupted over a large extent by the continuum from star 3 .",
    "the uncontaminated samples are shown in figure 3a , and with the sor signal magnified in figure 3b .",
    "this remaining sample permits one useful measurement along the sor at a point 1.36  arcsec east of the sn ( labeled `` a '' in figure 1 ) , and three measurements of comparable accuracy along the nor , 1.04 , 1.40 and 1.68  arcsec west ( points `` b '' through `` d '' in figure 1 ) .",
    "these yield velocity values of 21.5  km  s@xmath4 ( blueshifted ) and 22.3 , 24.6 and 21.1  km  s@xmath4 ( redshifted ) , respectively , relative to the 289  km  s@xmath4 heliocentric redshift of sn  1987a , with @xmath21 errors of about 2  km  s@xmath4 , except for the last point , with an error of about 3  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "as discussed by crotts & heathcote ( 1991 ) , the velocity field of the er , best traced by [ n ii]@xmath26583 , has a centroid at 289  km  s@xmath4 , with little velocity shear across the er at pa@xmath22 , almost parallel to the er major axis , but with strong velocity shears on either side , at pa@xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "there are additional , fainter emission patches at larger radius or velocity offsets from the centroid .",
    "occasionally such faint sources correspond to transient spots ( crotts , kunkel & mccarthy 1989 , hanuschik 1990 , crotts & heathcote 1991 , cumming & meikle 1993 , cumming 1994 ) , but at the time of these observations no such spots were revealed in optical imaging .",
    "these fainter , outrigger sources observed here are almost certainly due to the ors .",
    "figure 4 shows the portion of the echelle order centered on the [ n  ii]@xmath25 line , showing the broad emission lines from the sn and stellar continua extending horizontally , and the lmc interstellar [ n  ii ] emission extending vertically .",
    "the bright patch in the center is emission from the cse .",
    "the underlying ism is fit linearly in the spatial dimension , interpolated across the cse , and subtracted off .",
    "the spectral continuum and broad emission is fit quadratically , and likewise interpolated and subtracted .",
    "this subtraction produces the residual distribution of flux shown in the contour plot of the echellogram in figure 5a ( with a vertical scale of 0.26  arcsec and horizontal scale of 3.50  km  s@xmath4 per pixel , at [ n  ii]@xmath26583 ) .",
    "there are notable protrusions from the nearly elliptical flux contours , particularly to the south at roughly the centroid velocity and to the north slightly to the red of centroid .",
    "furthermore , the flux contours at low levels become more rectangular , as if flux might be appearing at the corners .      we know the flux distribution in [ n  ii]@xmath26583 of both the er and ors from the hst images , and have good constraints on the global velocity structure of the er . furthermore , comparing the width of the er feature in the [ n  ii ] and h@xmath16 echellograms , we see a significant difference most likely due to thermal broadening . accounting for the different atomic masses producing the lines we find the temperature of the gas at day 3569 to be roughly @xmath26k ( to within roughly 20% ) .",
    "( this compares to other temperature measurements at late times : @xmath27k on day 1278 , from [ o ii ] and [ n ii ] recombination [ wang 1991 , sonneborn et al .  1997 ] ; 55000k on @xmath5day 300 from [ o iii ] [ wampler & richichi 1989 ] .",
    "the lower temperature we measure on day 3569 may be due to the cooling of the gas , or due to h @xmath16 and [ n  ii ] emission arising from different gas .",
    "recombination model calculations predict @xmath28k throughout the er by day 2000 [ lundqvist & fransson 1996 ] . )   we can also measure the spatial and spectral line spread functions of the spectrograph from the width of the stellar continuum and night sky lines in the echellogram .",
    "given these parameters we can model the image of the cse produced by the spectrograph on the detector and construct the synthetic echellogram shown in figure 5b . at high flux levels , it appears very similar to the actual data , but at low flux levels differs by the absence of the extensions mentioned above .",
    "the width of the spatial and spectral line spread functions , temperature , and placement of the slit are allowed to vary over a grid of values spanning approximately @xmath2910% in each of these parameters , in order to produce a family of model echellograms , and the minimum @xmath30 ( in terms of the square - root of counts per pixel ) , within the region covered by non - zero flux from the model .",
    "the resulting best fit model is shown in figure 5b , and the difference between the data and fit shown in figure 5c .",
    "this corresponds to a best fit of 9.5  km  s@xmath4 in radial expansion velocity of the ring away from the sn , with a probable error of about 5 - 10% ( which is difficult to estimate given systematic errors in other parameters ) .",
    "note that the number of contours in the residual features is several times fewer than in the original , figure 5a , and that the contour levels are five times finer in figure 5c , so that the extreme residual features are only about 7% of the original peak flux , and cover regions on the scale of single pixels , so that residual features within the region of the model are at most about 1% of the total .",
    "this compares to expected poisson errors from photon counting statistics at the 0.3% level , so a much better fit would be difficult to achieve .      outside the region modeled in  3.2.1",
    ", several significant residuals appear : to the north and south at roughly the centroid velocity , and to higher and lower velocities at roughly the centroid position along the slit .",
    "these four residuals are centered at ( @xmath3121.7  km  s@xmath4 , 0.39 arcsec north ) , ( @xmath322.8  km  s@xmath4 , 2.18 arcsec south ) , ( @xmath324.2  km  s@xmath4 , 1.98 arcsec north ) , and ( @xmath3320.3  km  s@xmath4 , 0.05 arcsec south ) , and have flux amounting to 2.8% , 2.8% , 2.0% and 1.1% , of the total , respectively .",
    "note that these radii along pa@xmath23 correspond closely to those measured from the wfpc2 image for the northern sor , southern sor , northern nor , and southern nor respectively : 0.71 arcsec north , 2.08 arcsec south , 1.96 arcsec north , and 0.08 arcsec south , with the first and fourth measurements being somewhat uncertain due to confusion with the er and sn , respectively .",
    "these positions agree between the echelle and @xmath1 datasets to within about 0.2 arcsec r.m.s .",
    ", less than an echelle pixel ( 0.26 arcsec ) .",
    "we can use the relative strength of the er and ors in the wfpc2 images to predict relatively how much light is entering the echelle spectrograph slit . from the stis g750 m data , we know that the or flux in the vicinity of the er ( but beyond @xmath50.3  arcsec to avoid being overwhelmed by the er ) are 2.5 - 3.5 times stronger in the [ n  ii]@xmath26583 line than in h@xmath16 . additionally , the throughput at the sn redshift in the wfpc2 f658n filter is 3.8 times greater at [ n  ii]@xmath26583 than at h@xmath16 , hence the or signal in the wfpc2 f658n image is 92% due to [ n  ii ] .",
    "this implies that even if the h@xmath16 flux were to vary by 100% of its strength relative to the [ n  ii]@xmath26583 flux at different points around the ors , the flux of the or [ n  ii]@xmath26583 flux can still be predicted to within 9% .",
    "the flux values inferred from wfpc2 for the south sor is 2.0% and for the north nor is 1.8% of the er signal within the slit , close to the values seen in the echellogram .",
    "the brightness of the north sor and south nor is difficult to determine in the wfpc2 image , again because of the contributions by the er and sn . given that most of the signal in the residual echelle features corresponds to the actual or fluxes , it would appear that errors in the flux could only decenter the signal by at most about 1 pixel in velocity , or about 4  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "we will take this as the probable error on the echelle or measurements .      to interpret these or velocity measurements , we compute a simple model for or loci in a homologous velocity flow , without imposing any constraint that the or and er velocities should compare , and then require that the projected shape of each or be consistent with its observed shape and location . for the purpose of computing homologous velocities",
    ", we make the approximation that all three rings are coaxial . for the nor , which appears nearly elliptical , we adopt an inclination angle set by assuming that the ring is really circular and is only seen as an ellipse in projection .",
    "this inclination angle is 42@xmath34.7 ( burrows et al .",
    "1995 ) with an error that we infer to be about 1@xmath34 .",
    "in contrast , the er has an inclination measured variously as 43@xmath35 ( jakobsen et al .",
    "1991 ) , 45@xmath34.3 ( burrows et al .",
    "1995 ) , or 44@xmath36 ( plait et al .  1995 ) .",
    "the sor is not truly elliptical , but the best fit ellipse corresponds to an inclination of 31@xmath34 ( burrows et al .",
    "for the sor we adopt two alternative geometries : a ) that it is inclined by 31@xmath34 , and b ) that it is inclined by 45@xmath34 , parallel to the er , but distorted from a circle .",
    "perhaps neither alternative is correct , but these at least span a reasonable range of possibilities .    under these assumptions ,",
    "the nor is expanding outwards from the sn at 26.1  km  s@xmath4 , while the sor expands at either a ) 25.5  km  s@xmath4 , or b ) 26.3  km  s@xmath4 ( along the minor axis ) , according to a best fit to the observed velocities from stis+wfpc2 and the ctio 4m / echelle .",
    "these fits are shown in figures 6a , b and c ( for the nor and sor models a and b , respectively ) .",
    "all three fits are reasonable , with reduced @xmath30 near unity .",
    "sor model b ( 31@xmath34 inclination ) fits slightly better than model a. the 1@xmath37 errors on all of these derived expansion velocities are about 2  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "( note that the above results appear consistent with those quoted by cumming & lundqvist [ 1994 ] . )",
    "these velocities should be compared the radial distance of the ors from the sn in order to derive a kinematic timescale . for the sake of discussion",
    ", we adopt a semimajor axis length of 1.7  arcsec for both ors .",
    "( we measure a slightly smaller value than the semimajor axis lengths found by burrows et al .  [",
    "1995 ] : 1.77 and 1.84 arcsec . )   for a distance to sn 1987a of 50 kpc , these models correspond to or distances from the sn of 0.58  pc for the nor , 0.52  pc for the sor ( model a ) , or 0.56  pc for the sor ( model b , along the minor axis ) .",
    "compared to the corresponding expansion velocities , these correspond to kinematic timescales of 21700 , 19900 and 20800  yr , respectively , indicating the time in which the ors would have coasted at their current velocities to their current positions .",
    "similarly , the er , with a semimajor axis of 0.86  arcsec ( plait et al .  1995 ) or 0.21  pc , would require 19500 years expanding at 10.5  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "clearly , these kinematic ages are consistent within the errors ( of @xmath38 11% ) .",
    "the longslit survey by xu & crotts ( 1999 ) of the 6 arcmin square around sn  1987a was intended to observe structure on scales considerably larger than the spatial sampling of 13 arcsec , but nonetheless provides some information on the cse of the sn . as seen in light echoes ( crotts & kunkel 1991 , crotts 1999 ) , there is an echo feature apparently centered on the sn extending some 5  pc towards earth , corresponding to an angular scale of 20 arcsec .",
    "a search for features on this scale in the longslit data set reveals two features ( figure 7 ) .",
    "one , centered near 279  km  s@xmath4 ( 10  km  s@xmath4 blueshift with respect to the sn ) is found between 25  arcsec east and 13  arcsec west , and between 18  arcsec north and 4  arcsec south of the sn .",
    "a second feature at 301  km  s@xmath4 ( 12  km  s@xmath4 redshift ) extends between 13 and 38  arcsec west , and 4  arcsec north and 15  arcsec south of the sn .",
    "these appear to form a possibly bipolar , or double - lobed , nebula , with the near side to the northeast , assuming material is being ejected .",
    "the axis of symmetry of this structure would lie along @xmath39 .",
    "these features are not perfectly coherent in velocity , however . while the @xmath15 detection level of individual segments of these features is low ,",
    "there appear to be significant gradients in velocity , so that the differences from the sn velocity centroid can extend up to 15  km  s@xmath4 .",
    "it is evident from figure 7 , however , that patches of roughly this spatial scale and velocity coherence exist in locations far away from the sn , such that there is a significant probability that one or both features are chance superpositions in projection against the sn .",
    "one possible method of investigating the association of these two features with the sn is to determine if their elemental abundances are more similar to the anomalous values found in the rings ( e.g.  lundqvist & fransson 1996 , sonneborn et al .",
    "1998 ) , or those typical in the lmc .",
    "we are currently pursuing this test of the origin of this gas .",
    "why do the kinematic and compositional timescales ( panagia et al .  1996 ) disagree ?",
    "of course , the simple kinematic timescale @xmath40 does not account for the acceleration of the rsg wind by the lower density ( and not directly observed ) bsg wind , so that at a given radius the winds interface i.e.  the freshly shocked rsg material , is actually expanding faster than the rsg wind just exterior to the shock . since",
    "this exterior wind has presumably coasted freely since leaving the progenitor , @xmath41 for this material is close to the actual time @xmath42 since the material left the progenitor . however",
    ", this may not be so for the material actually observed . in comparing @xmath41 for different parts of the cse we wish to know whether the ratio of @xmath43 is constant throughout .",
    "recent models of interacting winds within a wind - compressed disk outflow ( collins et al .",
    "1999 ) can lead to velocity fields over the winds interface which produce a nearly constant @xmath43 throughout ( collins et al .",
    "1999 , fig .  2 and a.  frank , private communication ) , while simultaneously producing a shape for the cse consistent with that observed .",
    "other models ( blondin & lundqvist 1993 , martin & arnett 1995 ) have a more complicated velocity flow , in which @xmath43 is nonuniform even on scales as small as @xmath44  cm .",
    "thus while a constant @xmath43 is consistent with the known morphology of the cse , it is by no means assured .",
    "in contrast , the compositional ratios computed by panagia et al .",
    "( 1996 ) are highly time - dependent , since the system is far from equilibrium while still recovering from the pulse of euv photons emitted during the first hours of the sn explosion .",
    "while the elemental ratios can be recovered from a time - dependent analysis of line ratios , the particular line ratios arising from the same gas can vary by large amounts over the course of time ( lundqvist and fransson 1991 ) .",
    "the panagia et al .",
    "study does not sufficiently explore these time - dependent effects .",
    "it is unclear that a compositional difference between the er and ors can be disentangled from these effects given the single epoch of data and relatively simple models considered , as a unique solution to the elemental abundances requires knowledge of the temperature and ionization shortly after it was heated and ionized by the sn flash ( p.  lundqvist , private communication ) .",
    "if the extended two - lobed nebula apparently in figure 7 is indeed associated with sn 1987a , its expansion velocity is 10 - 15  km  s@xmath4 slower than the or velocities , but roughly equal to the er expansion velocity . if this nebula is associated with the sn , what is its three - dimensional configuration ?",
    "this is difficult to know certainly given the absence of light echoes from the outer regions of this double - lobed object .",
    "this absence might simply be due to insufficient light travel time to cover the whole structure , which would probably require 30  yr or more . in two - dimensional projection ,",
    "the correspondence of this structure to gas at smaller radii is not obvious .",
    "its symmetry axis ( @xmath39 ) is far from the axis of the ring system ( @xmath45 ) or its equatorial plane .",
    "since this nebula does extend significantly to the north and south of the sn , however , if it does surround the sn , it likely envelops the ors , too . in this case , the ors are expanding at @xmath525  km  s@xmath4 into a medium expanding at only 10 - 15  km  s@xmath4 , and are therefore being accelerated by the bsg wind into the slower rsg wind medium .",
    "it is not clear that the er has been accelerated by a proportionally large fraction of its own velocity , implying that it might be younger than the ors .",
    "this runs in the same sense as the inequality between er and or ages inferred by panagia et al .",
    "regardless of the nature of the extended nebulosity , it is evident that the inner portions of the cse are expanding at different velocities .",
    "this is different from at least the initial conditions assumed in all simulations of the sn s cse , with the exception of collins et al .",
    "other simulations tend to produce an asymmetric boundary between the bsg and rsg winds with an isotropy in matter density , not velocity .",
    "it is interesting that both can be probed using not only narrow - line emission , but also light echoes , which trace dust density .",
    "furthermore , if the cse terminates in a contact discontinuity against an interstellar bubble of constant pressure ( chevalier & emmering 1989 ) , the shape of this contact discontinuity is a measure of the momentum flux as a function of angle around the sn , since pressure must be matched along the discontinuity s surface .",
    "thus in directions from the sn of higher outward ram pressure @xmath46 at a given radius , the wind will be forced to a halt at a larger radius .",
    "this will be investigated in paper iii .",
    "regardless of the shape of the cse , its size scale combined with the outflow velocity , especially where gas is simply coasting and not being accelerated along a wind interface , provides an estimate of the minimum age of the cse .",
    "it is only a lower limit because mass has accumulated in the contact discontinuity .",
    "a cse radius of 5  pc and a velocity scale of @xmath515  km  s@xmath4 implies a minimum cse lifetime of @xmath5350000  yr .",
    "this compares to model predictions to the duration of the rsg phase of sn 1987a of about 190000  yr ( woosley , pinto & ensman 1988 ) minus a terminal bsg phase beginning 10000 - 20000  yr before explosion ( woosley et al .",
    "1988 , saio , kato & nomoto 1988 ) .",
    "while the terminal bsg phase lifetime is in agreement with observations , the rsg phase appears too short in the models .",
    "this would imply that the sn progenitor depleted its core helium supply earlier than expected .",
    "further work is needed to explain the production of these three rings .",
    "lloyd , obrien and kahn ( 1995 ) interpret the rings in terms of interacting winds from the progenitor in the presence of a companion star .",
    "also , chevalier and dwarkadas ( 1995 ) propose that the rings arose from the collision of the bsg and rsg winds , with the further action of ionization by the progenitor , but no complete interacting - wind model has yet to be formulated .",
    "models ( meyer 1997 , soker 1999 ) that naturally explain the formation of a three - ring system fail in other important respects , either in not predicting ( meyer 1997 ) the cavity interior to the three rings , as evidenced by the rapid fall and only gradual rise of the radio signal from ejecta / cse interaction ( turtle et al .",
    "1987 , staveley - smith 1993 ) , or in failing to incorporate ( soker 1999 ) the diffuse nebulosity seen in the outer cse ( crotts & kunkel 1991 , crotts 1998 ) and between the rings ( crotts et al .  1995 , see also lundqvist & fransson 1996 ) .",
    "the eventual model , in order to be successful , must now account for the motions seen in the rings and beyond .",
    "the authors would like to thank peter lundqvist and the anonymous referee for helpful comments .",

    "there are notable protrusions from the nearly elliptical flux contours , particularly to the south at roughly the centroid velocity and to the north slightly to the red of centroid , and flux contours at low levels become more rectangular , as if flux might be appearing at the corners .",

    "figure 5c shows the resulting residual between the actual data and the best fit .",
    "note that the number of contours in the residual features is several times fewer than in the original , figure 5a , and that the contour levels are five times finer in figure 5c , so that the extreme residual features are only about 7% of the original peak flux , and cover regions on the scale of single pixels , so that residual features within the region of the model are at most about 1% of the total .",
