    "evolution equations with applications in the natural sciences typically contain some structural information reflecting inherent physical properties such as positivity , mass conservation , or energy and entropy dissipation . in this paper , we propose novel one - step and two - step semidiscrete numerical schemes , which preserve the structure of the underlying diffusive equations . for the analysis , we combine linear multistep discretizations , investigated for ordinary differential equations from the 1980s on , and entropy dissipation methods , which have been proposed in recent years .",
    "linear multistep methods refer to previous time steps and derivative values .",
    "they are proposed to solve stiff differential equations .",
    "an important class of these methods are the backward differentiation formulas ( bdf ) .",
    "multistep methods were also applied to nonlinear evolution equations .",
    "for instance , linear multistep schemes for fully nonlinear problems , which are governed by a nonlinear mapping with sectorial first frchet derivative , were dealt with , by linearization , in @xcite , and quasilinear evolution equations were treated in @xcite . in @xcite , multistep discretizations for problems governed by maximal monotone or monotone operators were studied . for monotone evolution equations , also other schemes were proposed , for instance , stiffly accurate implicit runge - kutta methods @xcite .",
    "error estimates for two - step bdf methods for nonlinear evolution equations were shown in @xcite .",
    "dahlquist introduced in @xcite so - called one - leg methods which need only one function evaluation in each time step . with every multistep method we can associate its one - leg counterpart and vice versa .",
    "it turned out that one - leg methods allow for a stability analysis for stiff nonlinear problems .",
    "the stability behavior was defined in terms of the so - called g - stability @xcite , which can be related to discrete `` energy '' dissipation @xcite .",
    "stiffness independent error estimates with the optimal order of convergence were derived in @xcite .",
    "our schemes are generalizations of dissipative multistep methods analyzed in , e.g. , @xcite . in order to explain the idea",
    ", we consider the evolution equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is some ( nonlinear ) operator defined on @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is a gelfand tripel ( see section [ sec.thm3 ] for details ) . in the literature , usually the monotonicity condition @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the dual product between @xmath6 and @xmath7 ,",
    "is assumed @xcite .",
    "this condition implies that the `` energy '' @xmath8 is nonincreasing : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the norm on @xmath11 .    in many situations , not",

    "then , replacing assumption by @xmath16 we find that formally @xmath17 = ( u_t(t),h'(u(t ) ) ) = -\\langle a(u(t)),h'(u(t))\\rangle \\le 0,\\ ] ] i.e. , @xmath18 $ ] is a lyapunov functional for which expresses the dissipation property of the evolution equation .",
    "note that condition formally reduces to for the special choice @xmath18=\\frac12\\|u\\|^2 $ ] .    in order to recover property on a discrete level , hill @xcite discretizes by the one - leg method @xmath19 where @xmath20 approximates @xmath21 with @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the time step size , and @xmath24 with @xmath25 , @xmath26 are approximations of @xmath27 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "hill proves that , under some assumptions , this scheme yields a dissipative discretization if and only if the scheme is strongly a - stable or strongly g - stable ( see section [ sec.g.ene ] for a definition of g - stability ) .",
    "the proof relies on the quadratic structure of the definition of g - stability ; this structure is already present in .",
    "unfortunately , does not possess such a structure and the proofs of @xcite do not apply under the assumption .",
    "the main idea of this paper is to _ enforce _ a quadratic structure by introducing the variable @xmath28 by @xmath29 ( assuming that @xmath30 ) .",
    "more precisely , we discretize in the formulation @xmath31 which is formally equivalent to .",
    "the semidiscrete scheme reads as @xmath32 note that @xmath33 approximates @xmath34 and @xmath35 approximates @xmath21 .",

    "the _ second aim _ of this paper is to prove that scheme possesses an ( entropy - dissipating ) nonnegative weak solution . for the existence proof",

    "the main conditions are that equation is nonnegativity - preserving and possesses two entropies , @xmath42 for @xmath43 and @xmath44 ( assuming that these expressions are defined ) .",
    "the nonnegativity - preservation of our scheme is inherited by the first condition .",
    "this property is proved by using the entropy density @xmath44 and the variable transformation @xmath45 .",
    "the entropy density @xmath42 allows us to show the entropy - dissipation of our scheme .",
    "we believe that the condition @xmath43 is technical . it is needed to control the discrete time derivative in when using the test function @xmath46 ( see lemma [ lem.est.t ] ) .",
    "a general existence proof would require more assumptions on @xmath1 which might restrict the applicability of our results .",
    "therefore , we prefer to demonstrate the flexibility of our ideas by investigating two very different examples for @xmath1 .",
    "the first example is a cross - diffusion system , the second one is a highly nonlinear equation of fourth order . in particular ,",
    "our scheme is _ not _ restricted to scalar or second - order diffusion equations . for these examples ,",
    "which are detailed in sections [ sec.1 ] and [ sec.2 ] , we give rigorous proofs of the existence of semidiscrete weak solutions to scheme .",
    "our _ third aim _ is to prove the second - order convergence of the one - leg scheme .",
    "given a sequence of positive solutions @xmath47 to and a smooth positive solution @xmath48 to , this means that there exists @xmath49 such that for all sufficiently small @xmath23 , @xmath50 for this result , we assume that the mapping @xmath51 satisfies a one - sided lipschitz condition and that the scheme @xmath52 is of second order ( see theorem [ thm.second ] for details ) .",

    "general one - leg multistep schemes , which dissipate the energy or entropy , are discussed in section [ sec.g ] .",
    "section [ sec.ex ] is devoted to the existence analysis .",
    "we detail the strategy of the existence proof in a general context and prove theorems [ thm.skt ] and [ thm.dlss ] .",
    "the second - order convergence of the scheme is proved in section [ sec.second ] .",
    "numerical examples in section [ sec.numerics ] for the cross - diffusion population model , using the two - step bdf and the so - called @xmath54-method ( see remark [ rem.ex ] ) , show that the discrete entropy @xmath36 $ ] decays exponentially fast to the stationary state . finally ,",
    "in the appendix , we derive the family of all g - stable second - order one - leg schemes .",
    "we state the existence theorems for the semidiscretized cross - diffusion system and fourth - order equation and a theorem on the second - order convergence of the one - leg scheme .",
    "the first example is the cross - diffusion population model of shigesada , kawasaki , and teramoto @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the density of the @xmath57-th species , @xmath58 , @xmath59 are the diffusion coefficients , @xmath60 , @xmath61 denote the self - diffusion coefficients , and the expression @xmath62 is the cross - diffusion term . the above system has been scaled in such a way that the coefficient of the cross - diffusion term is equal to one ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the equations are solved on the @xmath63-dimensional torus @xmath64 with the initial conditions @xmath65 our results are also valid for homogeneous neumann boundary conditions and suitable reaction ( lotka - volterra ) terms .",
    "this model describes the time evolution of two competing species neglecting lotka - volterra terms and effects of the environment .",
    "the basic idea is that the primary cause of dispersal is migration to avoid crowding instead of just random motion , modeled by diffusion .",
    "the model can be derived from a random walk on a lattice by assuming that the transition probabilities for a one - step jump depend linearly on the species numbers .",
