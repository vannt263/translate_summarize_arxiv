    "recently the icecube collaboration has reported the first observation of extremely intriguing two events with neutrino energies above 1 pev  @xcite . these are by far the highest neutrino energies that have ever been observed .",
    "as such they could potentially represent the first detection of a non - atmospheric , astrophysical high energy neutrino flux , thus opening an avenue for a number of astrophysical objects and mechanisms to provide information complementary to that obtained from electromagnetic or hadronic observations  @xcite . in a follow - up search with improved sensitivity and extended energy coverage , icecube has reported additional 26 events with deposited energies ranging from 30 to 300 tev  @xcite .",
    "these 28 events are the result of the first 662 days of data - taking , and give a preliminary significance of @xmath2 with respect to the reference atmospheric neutrino background model .",
    "these observations may well hold the key to understanding neutrino masses , the nature of neutrino mass - hierarchy , their relevance to dark matter , or in general , to physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "for these reasons , it is extremely important to understand every possible aspect of these icecube events .",
    "this realization has spurred a lot of interest on the origin of these ultra - high energy ( uhe ) neutrino events and their underlying spectral shape .",
    "various extra - terrestrial sources ( e.g. , gamma - ray bursts , active galactic nuclei , early supernovae , baby neutron stars , starburst galaxies , cosmogenic )  @xcite with different power - law fluxes have been analyzed . from a particle physics point of view , several beyond sm phenomena , e.g. , decaying heavy dark matter  @xcite , lepto - quark resonance  @xcite , decay of massive neutrinos to light ones over cosmological distances  @xcite , and pseudo - dirac neutrinos oscillating to their sterile counterparts in a mirror world  @xcite , have been proposed .",
    "most of these proposals are motivated by some specific features in the icecube data such as a ( slight ) paucity of muon tracks , a ( possible ) apparent energy gap between 300 tev and 1 pev , and possibly a bit higher than expected event rate above pev .",
    "our primary aim in this paper is to carefully scrutinize the icecube observations with respect to the sm expectations , taking into account the theoretical uncertainties , mainly due to the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) . following the icecube analysis  @xcite , which did not find significant clustering of the events in time or space compared to randomized sky maps , we assume a simple isotropic astrophysical power - law spectrum for the uhe neutrino flux @xmath0 , and",
    "show that for @xmath1 - 2 , the current data is consistent with the sm , within the theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "thus there is no significant feature of the current data requiring an exotic particle physics explanation , other than of course a very interesting new cosmic neutrino flux .",
    "however , we want to stress that there are mild indications of slight potential deficit of muons in comparison to other flavors and perhaps a little excess of above pev events .",
    "if these features attain clear statistical significance as more data is accumulated , then some new physics interactions may well become necessary ; but at this juncture , these considerations appear somewhat premature .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec:2 ] , we calculate various neutrino - induced scattering cross sections in the sm , along with their differential distributions , for a reference pdf set , and compare the predictions for the central value as well as the 90% confidence level ( cl ) range of the pdfs at leading order ( lo ) , next - to - leading order ( nlo ) and next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we use the icecube experimental parameters to carefully estimate the corresponding number of events predicted by the sm , along with its theoretical uncertainty , and compare our results with the icecube observed events for a simple power - law cosmic neutrino flux .",
    "we also perform a @xmath3-analysis to find the best - fit spectral index and normalization for this new flux .",
    "finally , our conclusions are given in section  [ sec:4 ] .",
    "the expected neutrino - induced event rate at icecube can be schematically written as @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the incoming neutrino energy in the _ laboratory frame _ , @xmath6 is the electromagnetic ( em)-equivalent deposited energy , @xmath7 is the time of exposure , @xmath8 is the solid angle of coverage , @xmath9 is the effective number of target nucleons , @xmath10 is the neutrino - induced interaction cross section , and @xmath11 is the incident neutrino flux . the main particle physics ingredient in eq .

    "our results for the total cross section agree well with those calculated using other pdf sets ; for a comparison , see e.g. ,  @xcite .    at very high neutrino energies ,",
    "the cross sections are dominated by contributions from very small @xmath32 , which currently have a large uncertainty directly associated with the underlying qcd dynamics at high energies  @xcite . in this regime , one might have to go beyond the dglap formalism  @xcite used by conventional pdf fits , and to consider the non - linear evolution of the parton distribution arising due to the physical process of recombination of partons in the parton cascade .",
    "this can be characterized by the saturation scale of the growth of the parton distribution , forming a color glass condensate  @xcite .",
    "such saturation effects lead to slightly higher values of the neutrino - nucleon cross section and a steeper energy dependence at very high energies ( @xmath59 pev )  @xcite .",

    "however , this possibility was disfavored by a dedicated follow - up analysis  @xcite .",
    "the average incoming neutrino energies required to explain the two pev events are found to lie below the glashow resonance region , and hence , the contributions from @xmath61 scattering to the total number of events turn out to be negligible ( see section  [ sec:3 ] )",

    "this is slightly different from the icecube signal+background best - fit given in ref .",
    "this mild disagreement may be due to one or several of the following reasons : ( i ) the icecube best - fit was derived from a global fit of the deposited energy and zenith distribution of the data to a combination of the atmospheric neutrino background and an isotropic astrophysical flux in the range of 60 tev - 2 pev , which does not include the lowest energy bin shown in fig .",

    "( iv ) some additional experimental effects relevant at lower energies to reduce the atmospheric background ( e.g. , hit probability ) not captured in our simple analysis .",
    "it is also important to note here that we have directly used the true value of the inelasticity parameter @xmath33 for a given pdf set in our numerical analysis , and not the the average inelasticity parameter as used in some of the previous analyses .    the total number of sm signal events in each channel over the entire energy range of interest shown in fig .

    "note that at the moment , the icecube detector can not distinguish between electromagnetic and hadronic shower events , and hence , collectively calls them the ` cascade ' events , whereas the muons appear as distinct ` track ' events .",

    "combining this with the 10.6@xmath112 background events , we obtain a total of @xmath113 signal+background events , which is consistent with the 28 events observed by icecube . from the energy distribution shown in fig .",

    "[ fig2 ] was obtained with the current _ upper _ limit on the normalization of an astrophysical @xmath106 flux ; hence , any additional excess in the future data and/or improvement in the flux limit would make it extremely difficult to explain by the sm alone , and could give us an important clue to some new physics .",

    "<S> the recent observation of two pev events at icecube , followed by an additional 26 events between 30 - 300 tev , has generated considerable speculations on its origin , and many exotic new physics explanations have been invoked . for a reliable interpretation </S>",
    "<S> , it is however important to first scrutinize the standard model ( sm ) expectations carefully , including the theoretical uncertainties , mainly due to the parton distribution functions . assuming a new isotropic cosmic neutrino flux with a simple unbroken power - law spectrum , @xmath0 for the entire energy range of interest </S>",
    "<S> , we find that with @xmath1 - 2 , the sm neutrino - nucleon interactions are sufficient to explain all the observed events so far , without the need for any beyond the sm explanation . with more statistics , this powerful detector could provide a unique test of the sm up to the pev scale , and lead to important clues of new physics . </S>"
