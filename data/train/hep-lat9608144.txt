    "in this report we discuss several issues concerning the light hadron mass spectrum in quenched qcd with the kogut - susskind  ( ks ) and wilson quark actions . for the ks action we use data generated in our @xmath0 measurements in the range @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the wilson data come from @xmath2  @xcite and @xmath0  @xcite measurements at @xmath3 .",
    "we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite for simulation details , concentrating here on physics issues .",
    "spectral quantities for the ks action are expected to have flavor breaking errors of @xmath4 . for the pion spectrum in physical units",
    "this means that @xmath5 to leading order in @xmath6 , where @xmath7 denotes the symmetry - breaking scale , _ ng _ means the nambu - goldstone channel @xmath8 and _ non - ng _ any other channels .",
    "an interesting implication is that the mass splitting @xmath9 should vanish linearly @xmath10 at @xmath11 , while the behavior should change to @xmath12 for fixed and finite values of @xmath13 satisfying @xmath14 .",
    "these predictions are confirmed in our data as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where we take @xmath15 for the non - nambu - goldstone pion .",
    "this conforms the result of a similar test made previously  @xcite .",
    "the nambu - goldstone pion mass for the ks action offers a good testing ground for the predictions of quenched chiral perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "we fit our data for @xmath16 for equal and unequal quark masses to the form ( fit-1 ) , @xmath17 \\\\    & + & c_4 ( m_1+m_2)^2a^2 + c_5 m_1m_2a^2 . \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the quadratic terms are added since fits with only the logarithm term become untenable as @xmath18 increases beyond @xmath19 .",
    "fits are also made in which the quark masses inside the logarithm are corrected by a constant shift to take into account the non - nambu - goldstone nature of @xmath20 in the ks formalism ( fit-2 ) .",
    "we find both types of fits to be acceptable , and the resulting @xmath21 reasonably stable as a function of lattice spacing as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . in this sense",
    "our data are consistent with the presence of the quenched chiral logarithm .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath21 , @xmath22 for fit-1 and @xmath23 for fit-2 , however , is a factor 23 smaller than is expected in the real world @xmath24 .",

    "continuum extrapolations of light quark masses have been recently discussed by several authors  @xcite . in fig .  [",

    "our results are obtained by a 2-loop running of tadpole - improved @xmath31 masses at the scale @xmath32 calculated with @xmath33 .",
    "the lattice spacing is fixed by @xmath34 .    for the wilson action",
    "our results show a weaker @xmath6 dependence compared with those of other groups , albeit errors are large and the lattice size used is rather small ( @xmath35fm ) . as a result ,",
    "the agreement of wilson and ks results after continuum extrapolation is less apparent ( _ cf . _ ref .",
    "we note , however , that the one - loop renormalization factor for the ks action has a large value of almost two in the range of our data .",
    "higher order corrections might well bring the results for the ks action into agreement with those of the wilson action .",
    "= 7.5 cm    = 7.5 cm",
    "determination of hadronic matrix elements often suffers from uncertainties in renormalization factors .",
    "an exceptional case is the vector meson decay constant @xmath36 for which the renormalization constant @xmath37 for the local vector current can be precisely determined non - perturbatively with the use of the conserved current  @xcite . for",
    "our wilson runs at @xmath38 5.9 , 6.1 and 6.3  @xcite , we obtain @xmath37= 0.532(4 ) , 0.595(3 ) and 0.640(4 ) , respectively .    in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we plot @xmath36 as a function of @xmath39 for the three @xmath18 values using the non - perturbative @xmath37 as well as the tadpole - improved perturbative result @xmath40 .",
    "we find an almost perfect scaling with the non - perturbative estimate of @xmath37 as was noted previously  @xcite , while the perturbative @xmath41 factor gives results significantly varying with @xmath18 .",
    "making a linear extrapolation of the non - perturbative results in @xmath42 , we obtain @xmath43 0.270(25 ) and @xmath44 0.239(10 ) in the continuum limit .",
