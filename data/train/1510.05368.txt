    "numerous physical settings lend themselves to creating such interfaces , including both warm and cold neutral atoms @xcite , quantum dots @xcite , nitrogen  vacancy ( and other ) colour centres @xcite and trapped ions @xcite .",
    "cavity optomechanical systems are a promising platform for novel quantum interfaces because they may be used to couple light to the ` stationary ' media listed above , and because existing mechanical oscillators have extremely long decay times ( @xmath0  s , _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . in these systems",
    "a mechanical degree of freedom with ( angular ) frequency @xmath1 is parametrically coupled to an optical cavity with linewidth @xmath2 .",
    "these devices have entered the quantum regime for the first time in recent years ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and they are set to find technological and research applications in a variety of capacities .",
    "for instance , a mechanical oscillator which is subject to radiation pressure arising from microwave and optical modes simultaneously may be used to couple superconducting circuits to optics @xcite ; the capability to do this at the quantum level would permit construction of quantum information networks that utilise the advantages of both low - loss optical transmission and the exquisite quantum control of superconducting circuits .",
    "there are also a wealth of proposals for employing cavity optomechanical coupling to prepare massive mechanical oscillators in non - classical states , which could allow sensitive probing of the quantum - to - classical transition @xcite or quantum - enhanced metrology ( _ e.g. _ mass sensing @xcite , accelerometry @xcite ) .    in many of these applications",
    "it is expedient to employ a low - frequency mechanical oscillator ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) ; for instance , devices with material - limited damping rates @xmath3 obey the scaling @xmath4 ( due to the akhiezer effect @xcite ) . furthermore , large optomechanical coupling rates require small cavity volumes , and the optical linewidth typically scales inversely with its length , so that @xmath2 is often unavoidably larger than @xmath1 in micro- and nano - optomechanical devices .",
    "this high - bandwidth operating regime , @xmath5 , is known as the _ unresolved sideband limit _ or _ bad - cavity limit _",
    ", despite the fact that the cavities involved often have large @xmath6 factors .",
    "current technologies make it possible to cool a mechanical oscillator to near its ground state in the unresolved sideband limit using optical measurement - based feedback cooling ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) , or to perform steady - state cooling using hybrid quantum systems @xcite , dissipative optomechanics @xcite , optomechanically - induced transparency @xcite , and related schemes ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "very rapid ground state cooling of the mechanical oscillator is also enabled by varying the optical drive s amplitude and phase dynamically @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one may exploit the large cavity bandwidth in the bad - cavity limit to engineer quantum non - demolition ( qnd ) interactions between short optical pulses and a mechanical oscillator ( _ cf_. ) @xcite .",
    "qnd interactions are the basis of proposed quantum ` upload ' interfaces , which write the state of one input mode onto one output mode @xcite",
    ". further applications of qnd interactions include generation of mechanical geometric phases @xcite , and cooling by measurement and state tomography @xcite .    despite this  and the success of optomechanical interfaces in the ` resolved - sideband ' ( @xmath7 ) , regime ( _ e.g. _ @xcite)there are currently no quantum optical  to  mechanical interfaces which permit a state swap in the unresolved sideband limit .",
    "teleportation schemes @xcite and the aforementioned quantum ` upload ' interfaces @xcite , which transfer an input state from one degree of freedom to another , are incapable of directly exchanging two input states .",
    "here we present a _ bidirectional _",
    "optomechanical interface which can perform a quantum state swap and other operations in the unresolved sideband limit .",
    "our interface is completely deterministic and does not rely on measurement or any form of conditioning or post - selection .",
    "furthermore , the proposed protocol only requires classical open - loop control , which may be performed with very low added noise ( _ i.e. _ below the back - action noise ) @xcite .",
    "we predict that the interface is capable of performing a number of important operations , including mechanical ground state cooling , squeezing , and exploiting non - gaussian optical inputs to create wigner - negative mechanical states , including low - amplitude schrdinger cat ( ` kitten ' ) states .",
    "we now show that qnd interactions may be performed by pulsed optomechanics , following @xcite .",
    "consider a mechanical oscillator with annihilation operator @xmath8 and angular frequency @xmath1 parametrically coupled to an optical cavity .",
    "as the ( dimensionless ) position of the oscillator @xmath9 ( momentum @xmath10 ) fluctuates the resonance frequency of the cavity also shifts .",
    "thus the optomechanical ( dispersive ) coupling hamiltonian takes the form @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the cavity annihilation operator and the optomechanical coupling rate is @xmath13 .",
    "this is understood as the frequency shift of the cavity per zero - point displacement of the oscillator . for a detailed discussion of the optomechanical hamiltonian",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "we assume that @xmath14 , as is usually the case ( _ e.g. _ review of parameters given by @xcite ) .",
    "then if a bright pump beam is applied to the cavity the interaction between the cavity field and mechanical fluctuations is well described by the effective linearised hamiltonian @xcite @xmath15 here , @xmath16 is the mean intracavity amplitude induced by the pump , and the optical fluctuation operator @xmath17 describes amplitude fluctuations of the field ( this expression is valid for real , positive @xmath18 ; for the general case see appendix [ app : fluctuationsdef ] ) .",
    "these quantities are written with explicit time dependence to show that they depend on the pulse used to illuminate the cavity .",
    "the phase fluctuations of the optical field @xmath19 do not appear in the interaction hamiltonian .",
    "both fluctuation operators obey @xmath20 for all times .",
    "we now consider applying pulses of light to the cavity .",
    "these are described by a mean amplitude @xmath21 , normalised such that the average number of photons in the input pulse envelope is @xmath22 and the instantaneous amplitude and phase noise operators , @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the latter are defined by analogy with the intracavity field .",
    "the optical field exiting the cavity is connected to the intracavity mode and input field through the input ",
    "output relation .",
    "this takes the form @xmath25 with a similar expression holding for the phase fluctuations @xcite .",
    "if the bandwidth of the pulse is large compared to both the mechanical frequency and the thermal heating rate @xmath26 we may neglect the damped dynamics of the oscillator over the duration of the interaction ; furthermore , the large cavity linewidth ( compared to the pulse bandwidth ) allows the optical fields to be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "together , these approximations yield effective langevin equations of the form    [ eqns : eom ] @xmath27    in which we have used to obtain & .    integrating and over the duration of the pulse and employing the fact that the pulse envelope changes rapidly compared to @xmath28 allows us to obtain the following transformation between the initial and final mechanical quadratures ( final quadratures are primed ) .",
    "@xmath29 where the interaction strength is @xmath30 .",
    "we see that the weighted optical amplitude fluctuations have been transferred onto the mechanical momentum @xmath31 , along with a classical momentum kick @xmath32 .",
    "it is possible to subtract off the classical kick by performing a displacement on the mechanical oscillator immediately after the interaction ; this can be done using open - loop control with very little added noise ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "we will therefore neglect this kick hereafter .",
    "motivated by the form of , we factorise the pulse envelope into the form @xmath33 ; thus the integral of @xmath34 over the whole pulse is unity .",
    "multiplying & by @xmath35 and integrating , we find @xmath36 in which the collective pulse quadratures @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( @xmath39 } } = { \\ensuremath{\\left [ x_{m},p_{m } \\right ] } } = 2{\\mathrm{i}}$ ] ) have been defined by @xmath40    note that these quadratures are zero - mean by construction .",
    "similar relations hold for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , with the input fields replaced by @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively .",
    "the evolution described by ( including a mechanical displacement ) and is thus a standard qnd interaction between the mechanical oscillator and the collective quadratures of the optical pulse ;    [ eqns : qnd ] @xmath45    each oscillator acquires information about one quadrature of the other during this interaction .",
    "a qnd interaction correlates each oscillator with the other , but only one quadrature at a time ; evidently some extra ingredients will be required to perform a complete state swap .",
    "we will first show how to use a sequence of qnd interactions and local operations to realize a state swap under ideal conditions .",
    "secondly , we will generalise our protocol to allow both state transfer and squeezing . in our approach",
    "the pulse enters and leaves the optomechanical cavity multiple times , with local operations on the pulse and mechanical resonator occurring between the optomechanical interactions .",
    "figure  [ fig : schema ] summarises the necessary steps , as presented below , graphically .",
    "this approach is in the spirit of the proposal of @xcite ; however , our protocol replaces measurement and feedback with a third qnd interaction to achieve a two - way interface .",
    "firstly , consider the case in which @xmath46 and there are no optical or mechanical decoherence mechanisms . from it",
    "is clear that a single qnd pulse correlates @xmath31 ( @xmath42 ) with @xmath37 ( @xmath47 ) . in order to build the necessary correlations between the other pair of quadratures we must exchange @xmath48 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath31 ( @xmath42 )",
    "this may be achieved by local @xmath49 rotations on each mode .    for definiteness",
    ", we can consider the local rotations to be generated in the following manner .",
    "delay the pulse for a quarter of a mechanical period before re - injecting it into the cavity to achieve a mechanical rotation of @xmath49 .",
    "the optical amplitude and phase noise rotations may be generated by _ displacing _ the optical state in phase space , as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] ( panel _ ii _ ) , _",
    "e.g. _ by interfering the pulse with a very bright , temporally matched pulse on a highly asymmetric beamsplitter ( _ cf_. fig .",
    "[ fig : schema ] , panel _ iii _ ) .",
    "if we apply these rotations and then allow the pulse and oscillator to interact for a second time the quadratures have been transformed according to    [ eqns : pulse2 ] @xmath50    the momentum quadratures have been entirely swapped , as desired , because the contribution of the initial mechanical position to @xmath31 due to free evolution has been coherently cancelled by the contribution of @xmath41 ( which depends on the initial position ) from the qnd interaction .",
    "however , it is clear that @xmath48 ( @xmath41 ) still retains some ` memory ' of the initial momentum @xmath51 ( @xmath38 ) of the mechanical ( optical ) oscillator ; this needs to be erased for the swap to be completed .",
    "fortunately , this can be achieved by a second pair of @xmath49 rotations and a third qnd interaction , _",
    "viz_.    [ eqns : pulse3 ] @xmath52    this is a perfect state swap , up to local rotations ( which we shall not consider ) , because the mechanical system now carries only fluctuations from the initial optical state , and vice versa .",
    "the fundamental limits on the interface s performance are imposed by optical loss and thermomechanical noise .    optical loss  such as coupling inefficiencies , scattering and absorption  is readily treated by coupling the circulating pulse to a vacuum bath on a beamsplitter with efficiency @xmath53 ( unity for perfect operation ) .",
    "the resulting nonhomogeneous evolution is @xmath54 where @xmath55 is vacuum noise .",
    "an analogous relation holds for @xmath38 .",
    "the properties of the vacuum mode are @xmath56 and @xmath57 . here",
    "we have introduced the symmetrised expectation value , @xmath58 .",
    "mechanical decoherence is induced by two intimately related mechanisms : loss of energy from the oscillator into a heat bath , and random excitation of the oscillator by the bath .",
    "these processes may be described by the langevin equations for the damped evolution ( _ cf_. @xcite ) ,    [ eqns : dampedlangevin ] @xmath59    momentum - dependent damping occurs at a rate @xmath3 whilst excitations enter via the random force @xmath60 at a rate of @xmath26 , where @xmath61 is the equilibrium occupancy of the oscillator , related to the bath temperature @xmath62 through the bose - einstein distribution ( hence @xmath63 for large temperatures ) .",
    "non - zero mechanical damping reduces the mechanical resonance frequency to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 . it will be convenient to introduce the parameter @xmath66 , which is small in the limit of high mechanical quality ( @xmath67 ) .",

    "it is given by @xmath74 .",
    "we close this section with some remarks about achieving @xmath46 in the face of experimental imperfections and decoherence .",
    "firstly , we wish to emphasise that many recent pulsed optomechanics experiments have entered a closely - related regime where the optomechanical cooperativity ( see ) exceeds @xmath61 ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "the essential difference is that our scheme simultaneously requires @xmath75 to be satisfied , implying that @xmath76 .",
    "this necessitates the use of a very large number of pulse photons , because we are by assumption operating with @xmath14 and @xmath77 .",
    "such high-@xmath78 pulses could be readily generated by acousto - optic or electro - optic ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) modulation of a pump beam over the timescales relevant to our scheme .",
    "for example , a pulse lasting @xmath79 of a mechanical period at @xmath80  khz requires an average power of @xmath81  mw to reach @xmath82 ( _ cf_. example experimental parameters given in table  [ table : experimentalparams ] ) .",
    "the chief technical issue expected to be encountered in this large @xmath78 limit is heating due to optical absorption , which is often a problem in continuous - wave optomechanics experiments .",
    "we present example calculations in appendix  [ app : chinegone ] that show , using real experimental parameters , that such heating remains manageable for our pulsed scheme even in the regime of @xmath46 .",

    "the mechanical frequency @xmath1 , zero - point coupling rate @xmath13 and optical linewidth @xmath2 are taken from silicon nitride microstring resonators evanescently coupled to silica microsphere whispering gallery modes @xcite ; the decay rate @xmath3 of comparable oscillators has previously been observed to be as low @xmath83  mhz @xcite . with these specifications and a bath temperature of @xmath84",

    "the three - pulse protocol introduced above may easily be generalised to the case in which the pulses have unequal interaction strengths , which we shall denote by @xmath90 where @xmath91 labels each pulse . this could be arranged by using the control ( displacement ) pulses to alter the mean number of envelope photons @xmath92 between qnd interactions .",
    "it will prove convenient to introduce a set of ` pulse strengths ' @xmath93 which take into account the level of decoherence present ; these are given by @xmath94 note that in the absence of decoherence the perfect state swap is achieved when @xmath95 .",

    "note that the latter may always be arranged by local operations on the input states , and that the mean amplitudes are unchanged by the interface .",
    "ground state cooling is a convenient starting point for several schemes that aim to generate non - classical states of motion @xcite , fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and many quantum information processing protocols ( _ e.g. _ see @xcite ) .",
    "we shall refer to systems with average occupancies less than one ( @xmath107 ) as ` ground state cooled ' or ` near ground state cooled ' .",
    "examples include @xcite .",
    "clearly the three - pulse state swap protocol introduced here can achieve optomechanical cooling in the bad - cavity limit ; a coherent optical pulse carries only vacuum ( zero temperature ) noise , which can be swapped onto the mechanical system . in order to formulate a ground state cooling criterion",
    "we calculate the evolution of the mechanics  light covariance matrix ( _ cf_. appendix  [ app : groundcooling ] ) .    the mechanical occupancy after a three  pulse state swap @xmath108 ( given explicitly in ) may be minimised with respect to the three pulse strengths following the procedure outlined in appendix  [ app : groundcooling ] . in the high-@xmath109",
    "limit the minimum is achieved at @xmath110 , yielding @xmath111    if the decoherence is dominated by thermomechanical noise , which is the case in the regime of interest ( assuming @xmath112 ) , we may insert into the ground state criterion @xmath107 to show that ground state cooling is possible only when the additional criterion @xmath113 is satisfied . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : decoherencemechs ] ( _ cf_. table  [ table : experimentalparams ] ) , meeting the requirement @xmath114 is experimentally tractable .",
    "the further condition is essentially a requirement of quantum coherent oscillation ( _ i.e. _ less than one phonon entering the oscillator per mechanical period ) .",
    "many experimental systems boast @xmath109 large enough to satisfy this at temperatures achievable with conventional refrigeration technologies ( _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "recent devices may permit this regime to even be reached at room temperature ( @xmath115 at @xmath116  khz ) @xcite .",
    "other strategies for optomechanical cooling , such as resolved - sideband cooling or cold damping , typically express their criteria for ground state cooling in terms of the optomechanical cooperativity @xmath117 .",
    "we will therefore recast into a requirement on the cooperativity .",
    "@xmath117 is a dimensionless parameter describes how strongly the quantum back - action of the optomechanical coupling ( due to amplitude noise ) perturbs the dynamics of the mechanical oscillator : in the steady state @xmath118 a natural quantity to use in the pulsed setting is the instantaneous cooperativity time - averaged over the entire three - pulse sequence ; thus @xmath119 where in the first line @xmath16 includes contributions from all three pulses .    substituting this definition into and noting that @xmath120 for optimum cooling yields @xmath121 thus , although operating in a pulsed manner and in a fundamentally different regime , our interface s ground state cooling criterion is remarkably similar to that of resolved - sideband cooling ( @xmath122 ) , the current ` gold standard ' for optomechanical cooling @xcite .",
    "we note also that it also resembles the criterion for feedback cooling to near the ground state in the bad - cavity regime , namely @xmath123 @xcite .",
    "however , it must be remembered that in the cooperativity must be evaluated with @xmath110 because a near - perfect state swap is only possible in this regime : merely having a large cooperativity does not guarantee near ground state cooling using the three - pulse protocol .    in the case that the pulse strengths are not equal to unity we find that significant cooling is still possible so long as the deviation in @xmath124 is less than a threshold value which scales inversely with @xmath125 ( appendix  [ app : tolerance ] , fig .",
    "[ fig : coolingcross ] ) ; high-@xmath109 oscillators are therefore more sensitive to imperfections in @xmath124 .",
    "the validity of is confirmed by numerical calculations of the final phonon occupancy for a variety of @xmath93 , @xmath3 and @xmath61 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coolingsurf ] ( and fig .",
    "[ fig : coolingcross ] ) . in all figures",
    "we have set @xmath126 .",
    "[ fig : coolingsurf ] shows the expected trend of decreasing final occupancy as the oscillator @xmath109 is increased and the initial temperature is decreased .",
    "the analytical threshold for near - ground - state cooling ( ) is in excellent agreement with the calculations .",
    "note that the lines of equal heating rate are curved because there is a non - zero incoming noise contribution from the mechanical bath even when the ambient temperature is zero .",
    "near ground state cooling can be realised using the three  pulse protocol with achievable experimental parameters , as shown in table  [ table : experimentalparams ] .",
    "this cooling will persist for a time proportional to @xmath127 after the conclusion of the protocol .",
    "we note that these same parameters also permit non - classical state transfer , as discussed below (   [ sec : fockstate ] ) .",
    "for more complicated quantum states the covariance matrix ceases to be a full description , so we now move to considering the evolution of the system s wigner function .",
    "the wigner function is a quasiprobability distribution ( appendix  [ app : non - gaussian ] ) which is permitted to be negative over parts of phase space ; negativity is considered to be a ` smoking gun ' for non - classical states @xcite .",
    "our interface uses only linear interactions and therefore can not generate wigner negativity .",
    "it can , however , _ transfer _ negativity from one system to another .",
    "we demonstrate this numerically by considering the preparation of a single phonon fock state ( appendix  [ app : fock ] ) .",
    "fock states have definite energy but completely undefined phase , and as such are highly nonclassical . as may be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : decoherence ] ( panels _ i__iii _ ) , transfer of a single - photon state onto the mechanical oscillator is possible with realistic mechanical parameters ( _ cf_. table  [ table : experimentalparams ] ) .",
    "note that the state becomes rotationally asymmetric when the noise entering from the thermal bath is significant , and that increasing the heating rate leads to degradation of the wigner negativity .",
    "this is consistent with thermalisation of the system during the protocol .",
    "higher - number mechanical fock states may also be prepared .",
    "we show the infidelity ( 1-@xmath128 , where @xmath128 is the schumacher fidelity @xcite ) of this operation in fig .",
    "[ fig : infidelity ] ( panel _ i _ ) .",
    "note that higher-@xmath129 fock states are more difficult to prepare because of their intrinsically larger susceptibility to environmental noise .",
    "the interface may be made to perform additional non - trivial operations on the states involved .",
    "here we consider fixing @xmath130 and allowing @xmath100 to take on non - unit values . in this case",
    "becomes ( setting @xmath131 ) @xmath132 which may be decomposed into a state transfer , _  la _ , followed by local squeezing operations ( one on each output ) with equal squeezing parameters @xmath133 .",
    "thus @xmath134 yields position - squeezed output states , and momentum - squeezed outputs may be prepared with @xmath135 .    in principle , it is then straightforward to generate unconditionally squeezed motion by transferring the noise of a coherent pulse onto the oscillator with @xmath136 .    a more intriguing application of this squeezed transfer is generation of small - amplitude mechanical schrdinger cat states ( coherent state superpositions ) , termed ` kitten ' states . as has been demonstrated in optical systems , these may be ` bred ' into large - amplitude cat states by a number of schemes @xcite ; this could result in a macroscopic superposition of a massive object .",
    "creating such a state is a research goal of foundational interest @xcite , and is also sufficient to allow universal quantum computation @xcite with phonons .",
    "any state of the form @xmath137 is an odd cat state .",
    "taking @xmath18 to be small and real , we have @xmath138 note that this contains only odd fock state contributions .",
    "a squeezer generates correlated pairs of photons ; it follows that weakly squeezing @xmath88 could give an approximation to an odd kitten state ( _ cf_. @xcite ) . for small squeezing parameters @xmath139 , @xmath140 by comparing these we see that the approximate kitten state has an amplitude given by @xmath141 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath142 .",
    "the wigner function of such a state is given in appendix  [ app : catstatewigner ] and shown with mild decoherence in fig .",
    "[ fig : decoherence ] ( panel _ iv _ ) .",
    "it is important to note that the wigner function contains two positive lobes along the @xmath48 axis ( ` alive ' and ` dead ' ) separated by a region of quantum interference exhibiting wigner negativity , proving that coherence between the lobes persists @xcite .",
    "again , note that these parameters are experimentally realisable ( although requiring very large @xmath78 to achieve the squeezing shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : decoherence ] , panel _ iv _ ) .",
    "the degree to which the decohering squeezed single phonon state approximates a true cat state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : infidelity ] ( panel _ ii _ ) .",
    "it is evident that large cat states can not be produced directly in this manner , as the minimum infidelity rises monotonically with @xmath143 ; this is not due to imperfections in our interface , but from the approximate equality of an odd cat state and a squeezed single phonon state .",
    "environmental noise clearly degrades the preparation process , both through decreasing the purity of the initial mechanical state and through destroying the phonon pair correlations required for squeezing .",
    "even so , it is possible to push the infidelity to low values with realistic parameters ( _ cf_. table  [ table : experimentalparams ] ) .",
    "we also note that other non - gaussian quantum states of light can be transferred to the mechanics by our interface thus providing several routes for motional state engineering .",
    "we have shown how open  loop rotations and displacements plus repeated qnd interactions may be used to construct an optomechanical interface which operates in the high - bandwidth ( @xmath5 ) limit of optomechanics , a natural operating regime for many devices .",
    "our calculations predict that such an interface is within reach of current experimental parameters ( _ cf_. table [ table : experimentalparams ] ) .",
    "furthermore , we have shown how our three - pulse protocol may be extended to performing more complicated operations , including optical  mechanical state transfer with squeezing of the final modes ; we note that it is also possible to perform a partial state swap which entangles the final modes , though we have not modelled that process here .",
    "these results show that optomechanical systems in the unresolved sideband limit are capable of performing an optomechanical state - swap , and may prove important in the construction of quantum networks and studies of macroscopic quantum mechanics .",
    "finally , we note that this three - pulse protocol could directly be applied in other circumstances where qnd interactions with light are available , such as in spin ensembles .",

    "given that the noise associated with this operation may be made arbitrarily small in principle ( by selecting an extreme asymmetry and applying a more powerful displacement pulse ) we will neglect it , or else absorb it into the total efficiency @xmath53 defined below .",
    "any optical losses due to inefficiencies within the recirculating loop may be partially compensated by altering the magnitude and phase angle of the displacement pulse , but contamination of the fluctuation quadratures by vacuum noise can not be reversed .",
    "losses may be modelled as an asymmetric beamsplitter which transmits @xmath202 of the circulating pulse ( @xmath203 ) and couples in vacuum noise proportional to @xmath204 .",
    "the qnd interaction ( including open loop displacement of the mechanics ) may be written as @xmath206 with @xmath207      we now consider the net evolution induced by a qnd interaction followed by a quarter - cycle delay and an optical displacement .",
