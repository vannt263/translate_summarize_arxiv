    "leontovitch and fock introduced the parabolic wave equation ( pwe ) ( also known as the fresnel equation ) about fifty years ago @xcite .",
    "the pwe is widely used in radiophysics and oceanic acoustics for modeling electromagnetic wave and sound propagation @xcite .",
    "an important application of pwe has been found in visible light and x - ray optics , where pwe is used to describe the propagation of weakly divergent light beams in inhomogeneous media @xcite .",
    "the pwe can be also used to describe coherent scattering phenomena in x - ray imaging @xcite .",
    "a lot of papers have been dedicated to the refinement of the parabolic equation method in order to increase its numerical accuracy and adjust it to specific physical problems ( wide - angle version @xcite , vectorial pwe @xcite , etc ) .",
    "however , there are important applications where the original leontovich s approximation still provides excellent accuracy and numerical efficiency . in particular , in hard x - ray optics , where optical constants are close to unity",
    ", leontovich s pwe is a powerful tool for modeling complex optical structures such as nano - waveguides @xcite and diffraction zone plates @xcite .",
    "no matter what kind of parabolic equation is concerned , any numerical solution , for instance , by a finite difference ( fd ) approximation , requires appropriate boundary conditions ( bc ) as realistic computational domains are necessary finite , while the original wave field might be sought in the whole space .",
    "such a bc must substitute accurate wave field calculations outside the finite computational domain with some relations between its boundary values @xcite .",
    "there are two main approaches to the computational domain truncation for the parabolic type equations . the first one is based on an exact analytical solution of the governing pe in the outer domain , free of diffracting objects .",
    "projection of such a solution onto the computational domain border leads to so called transparent boundary conditions ( tbc ) @xcite",
    ". completely different idea underlies the perfectly matched layer ( pml ) techniques @xcite : the assumption that a gradual change of the medium parameters by adding small absorption will cause the outgoing wave attenuation without producing backward reflection .",
    "both approaches have their advantages and shortcomings : the former one is in a sense exact but may involve sophisticated derivations whereas the letter is analytically simpler but basically of approximate nature . in this paper",
    "we will only deal with the former type , which is based on assumption that any wave that reaches the boundary from within of the computational domain propagates outward and never returns .",
    "tbcs are generally non - local neumann - to - direchlet or direchlet - to - neumann mappings relating the wave field amplitude boundary values with its first derivative a coordinate .    for a general review of tbcs and their applications",
    "see @xcite . here",
    "we confine ourselves with the original leontovich 2d pwe .",
    "for this equation , i.e. eq . ( [ 0a ] ) ( see below ) with @xmath0 , a tbc was formulated about twenty years ago and now is known as basakov - popov - papadakis ( bpp ) condition @xcite .",
    "a tbc for the linear potential ( see eq .",
    "( [ 0b ] ) below ) but for constant coefficient @xmath1 has also been known for a long time @xcite , although , involving integration of a ratio of airy functions to obtain the kernel , it is quite complicated and poses difficulties for the numerical implementation @xcite . in this paper , extending our previous work @xcite we contrive to obtain two tbcs for the 2d pwe : ( i ) one for the linear potential with varying coefficient @xmath2 ( ii ) and one for the quadratic potential ( see eq .",
    "( [ 0c ] ) below ) .",
    "these tbcs do not involve special functions and additional integration , having kernels explicitly expressed via elementary functions .",
    "we also try to preserve as much generality as possible by considering in the linear potential case the curvature @xmath2 to be an arbitrary positive function of @xmath3 .",
    "in this paper we will only be concerned with the linear 2d pwe having the following form @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath3 are coordinates , @xmath6 is the wave number and @xmath7 is a finite function . the computational domain is defined as @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a positive number .",
    "we will also assume that @xmath10 when @xmath11 .",
    "( [ 0a ] ) is a full analog of the 1d schrdinger equation ( se ) , where @xmath3 is replaced with time and @xmath12 is the potential .",
    "the function @xmath7 generally comprises both on the dielectric permittivity of the medium and on a particular choice of the coordinate system @xcite .",
    "for instance , in a weakly bent optical waveguide or fiber we can introduce a curvilinear system of coordinates so that the propagation of light is described by the ordinary pwe but with a fictitious dielectric permittivity , which is a sum of the true dielectric permittivity @xmath13 and an additional term resulting from this particular choice of coordinates .",
    "we will consider two cases for the dependance of @xmath7 on the transversal coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "the first case is that of the linear dependance with the coefficient itself dependent on @xmath3 as is shown in the following expression @xmath14 where @xmath13 is a function having a compact support , i.e. @xmath15 outside the the computational domain when @xmath11 , @xmath16 is a constant and @xmath2 is a real positive function .",
    "so , outside the computational domain we have the pwe with linear dependence of @xmath7 on coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "it can be shown that in the case of weak bending @xmath17 in the second term of eq .",
    "( [ 0b ] ) . in other words",
    "@xmath2 is the curvature of the waveguide or fiber and @xmath18 is the curvature radius .    in the second case function @xmath7 can be expanded further up to the second order by coordinate @xmath5 as @xmath19 where @xmath13 has a compact support as in the previous case and @xmath20 is a parameter . in ( [ 0c ] )",
    "we omitted the linear term as it can be always eliminated by a simple shift of the coordinate system .",
    "the 2d pwe with the quadratic dependence of the potential term on a coordinate may have applications in the waveguide theory in optics and acoustics . in case of the quantum mechanics and 1d se",
    "the quadratic potential describes a particle in a parabolic trap ( in case the potential is attractive ) , which is itself an interesting problem , and which numerical solution can be greatly facilitated by an appropriate tbc .",
    "we will derive exact tbc from eq .",
    "( [ 0a ] ) with both linear and quadratic dependence of @xmath12 on @xmath5 by applying to it the laplace transform by coordinate @xmath5 .",
    "the transformed equations will be linear and of the first order relative the partial derivatives and susceptible to the solution by standard methods of the mathematical physics @xcite .",
    "the final result is obtained by applying the reverse laplace transform to the obtained solutions .",
    "let us consider the pwe ( [ 0a ] ) with function @xmath12 from ( [ 0b ] ) . then beyond and at the boundary of the computational domain defined above as @xmath21 , where @xmath9 is a positive number , it takes the following form @xmath22 where the parameters have been defined before .",

    "since the sources of the wave field are located where @xmath34 , the field should decrease when @xmath41 .",

    "note that the phase like value ( [ 3j ] ) has a growing negative real part and its imaginary part goes to a constant when @xmath79 , which corresponds to the points furthest from the current position at @xmath3 .",
    "this fact means that these remote points have little or no influence on the integrals in ( [ 3i ] ) , which is not surprising for a strongly leaking waveguide ( or a repulsive potential in case of the 1d se ) corresponding to the case when @xmath80 . in such a waveguide or potential the boundary functions as a sink for the waves incident on it . on contrary ,",

    "this fact means that all points from @xmath84 to @xmath3 has strong influence on the integrals in ( [ 3k ] ) , which can be explained by reflection of waves from the boundary in case of a confining waveguide or an attractive potential . in the more general case when @xmath20 is a complex number ,",
    "the behavior of integrals is intermediate between these two extreme cases .",
    "in this work we derived two exact transparent boundary boundary conditions for the 2d pwe ( or for the equivalent 1d se ) .",
    "the first of them is for a linear dependence of the permittivity ( or potential in case of 1d se ) on transversal coordinate @xmath5 ( see eq .",
    "( [ 0b ] ) ) with the coefficient also dependent on the longitudinal coordinate @xmath3 .",
    "the second tbc is for a quadratic dependence on @xmath5 with constant coefficients ( see eq .",
    "( [ 0c ] ) ) . as is usual for the tbcs they are non - local by the longitudinal coordinate ( or time for the 1d se ) .",
    "the integral kernels of both tbcs contain only elementary functions and relate the derivative of the field amplitude by the transversal coordinate at the boundary of the computational domain to the amplitude itself .",
    "this fact favorably distinguishes them from the known transparent boundary conditions , where the kernels are defined as some complex integrals over expressions containing special functions .",
    "this makes such conditions often difficult to apply in practice .    for the practical application of both tbcs",
    "they must be discretized to be used with a specific fd scheme . for the popular crank  nicholson fd scheme @xcite",
    "such a discretization may be done by using linear interpolation of slowly changing field amplitudes at the boundaries of the computational domain .",
    "the main problem remains how to develop a stable and accurate numerical integration method for the integral kernels in ( [ 1q])([1r ] ) and ( [ 3i])([3l ] ) that contain weak singularities and fast oscillating functions .",
    "we are planning to discuss this issue elsewhere .",
    "if the problems of discretization are overcome , the tbcs derived in the present paper may significantly simplify the numerical solution of the 2d pwe ( or the equivalent 1d se ) by fd schemes in cases when the dielectric permittivity or potential have a linear or quadratic dependence on the transversal coordinate outside the computational domain .",
    "they may find applications also in 3d ( 2d and 3d se ) case if the fd scheme for a higher dimension equation is reduced to fd schemes of lower dimensions at the boundary of the computational domain as it was done , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "the authors would like to thank a.v .",
    "vinogradov for the fruitful discussions about the parabolic and schrdinger equations and their applications .",
    "in order to derive equality ( [ 1l ] ) let us find the following limit @xmath85 taking into account that @xmath86 we conclude that    @xmath87    let us derive equality ( [ 1 m ] ) .",
