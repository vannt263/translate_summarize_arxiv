    "one typical example is hole - doped perovskite manganites re@xmath4ae@xmath5mno@xmath6 ( re being a trivalent rare - earth ion and ae being a divalent alkaline - earth ion ) , where a charge - orbital - ordered insulating ( co / oo ) phase and a ferromagnetic metallic ( fm ) one keenly compete with each other .",
    "a lot of intriguing phenomena such as colossal magnetoresistance and insulator - metal transition induced by various external stimuli are observed near the bicritical point , where the two phases are almost degenerate in free energy.@xcite    in addition to the external field , quenched disorder arising from the local lattice distortion and/or doped impurities can also significantly modify the electronic structure in the bicritical region.@xcite a first - order phase transition line separating the two phases completely disappears and instead phase - separated or mixed glassy states on various length- and time - scales are generated depending on the magnitude of the randomness .",
    "concerning the phase separation caused by strong disorder , effects of impurity doping onto mn sites have been intensively investigated so far .",
    "typical examples include an impact of cr doping in half - doped co / oo manganites.@xcite . a few - percent substitutes of cr easily destroy the long - range co / oo phase and induce the fm one locally , which results in the phase - separated ground state with both co / oo and fm clusters randomly distributed .",
    "in contrast to the above , it has recently been found that fe doping in a fm manganite locating near the bicritical point , such as ( la@xmath7pr@xmath8)@xmath9ca@xmath10mno@xmath2 , has also a marked impact ; it dramatically suppresses the fm state and instead ( short - range ) co / oo correlation evolves down to low temperatures.@xcite in fact , as small as 5% fe doping effectively decreases the ferromagnetic transition temperature , @xmath11 , by @xmath1270% , while the same amount of cr or ga doping only results in a slight decrease in @xmath11 by at most @xmath1210% .",
    "thus , the disorder effect on the bicritical - state manganite is likely to significantly depend on the impurity species.@xcite    in this study , we aim to reveal the comprehensive features of the dopant - dependent mn - site doping effect by systematically substituting a variety of transition metals for mn in a critical system of @xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 single crystals . as shown in the inset to fig .",

    "let us here discuss the origin of the contrastive nature of fe and cr doping , as demonstrated above . since both ions prefer to be trivalent state and are antiferromagnetically coupled with mn ones@xcite , the carrier density shift or the sign of the superexchange interaction can not account for their opposite impacts on the bicritical state .",

    "et al._@xcite explains the ability of cr doping to induce the fm state in the co / oo structure as follows : in the ce - type charge - orbital ordering , the fm zigzag chains of mn@xmath89/mn@xmath90 are coupled antiferromagnetically .",
    "the substituted cr@xmath89 will then locate in a zigzag chain with its spin orientation opposite to that of the neighboring zigzag chains .",

    "in addition to the cr - mn coupling , we have to take into consideration the effect of the cr - cr interaction when the cr concentration is further increased .",
    "if the antiferromagnetic interaction between neighboring cr ions were dominant over other exchange interactions , the induced fm clusters could not expand with aligning their spins in the same direction , which would make the spin system glass - like without developing the fm correlation . in the present case of cr doping in the @xmath3=gd system",
    ", however , the fm correlation continues to grow with increasing the cr content up to as high as 20% , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gsmco ] .",
    "this means that the cr - cr interaction is very weak , or negligible , where the evolution of the fm clusters due to the cr - mn interaction can be energetically favored .",

    "note here that the estimated exchange interaction energy @xmath93 between fe ions ( @xmath1243 k ) is merely slightly larger than that between cr ions ( @xmath1237 k ) , which indicates that the difference in their spin moments may give a dominant contribution to the above tendency .",

    "in particular , a crossover from reentrant @xmath75 glass to @xmath94 spin glass takes place with increasing the doping level , as revealed by a dynamical scaling analysis of ac susceptibility .",
    "microscopically , the short - range charge - orbital ordering has been found to coexist in the spin - glass phase by a measurement of transmission electron microscopy .",
    "the resultant phase diagram versus the fe concentration therefore is closely akin to that of the parent @xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 system versus the one - electron bandwidth represented as a tolerance factor . by selectively suppressing the ferromagnetic metallic correlation , fe doping is equivalent to the reduction of the bandwidth for the system in the phase - competing region . in the spin - glass insulating phase for @xmath3=gd , on the other hand ,",
    "fe doping plays only a minor role while the cr ( or ru ) doping effect is prominent .",
    "in 10 - 20% cr - doped crystals , an evolution of the ferromagnetic state is observed at low temperatures , which will be induced by the collapse of the charge - orbital correlation underlying in the @xmath3=gd system . reflecting the short - range correlation of the charge - orbital ordering ,",
    "however , only small - size ferromagnetic clusters seem to be produced , where no metallic conduction manifests itself even below the onset temperature of ferromagnetism .",
    "such a contrastive tendency of fe and cr doping is likely to hold for a variety of bicritical - state manganites , which enables us to bidirectionally control the competing phases by means of the impurity doping .",

    "<S> versatile features of impurity doping effects on perovskite manganites , @xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 , have been investigated with varying the doing species as well as the @xmath3-dependent one - electron bandwidth . in ferromagnetic - metallic manganites ( @xmath3=la , nd , and sm ) , a few percent of fe substitution dramatically decreases the ferromagnetic transition temperature , leading to a spin glass insulating state with short - range charge - orbital correlation . for each @xmath3 species , </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram as a function of fe concentration is closely similar to that for @xmath0sr@xmath1mno@xmath2 obtained by decreasing the ionic radius of @xmath3 site , indicating that fe doping in the phase - competing region weakens the ferromagnetic double - exchange interaction , relatively to the charge - orbital ordering instability . </S>",
    "<S> we have also found a contrastive impact of cr ( or ru ) doping on a spin - glass insulating manganite ( @xmath3=gd ) . </S>",

    "<S> the observed opposite nature of impurity doping may be attributed to the difference in magnitude of the antiferromagnetic interaction between the doped ions . </S>"
