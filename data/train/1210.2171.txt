    "the limited availability and environmental impact of fossile fuels motivate the development of renewable energy sources .",
    "significant research efforts are currently made to propose energy harvesting concepts and prototypes converting the kinetic energy of geophysical flows such as winds , rivers and oceanic or tidal currents into electricity @xcite . in parallel , a particular attention",
    "is currently given to systems able to produce limited amount of energy from different vibration sources in order to power remote or isolated devices @xcite .",
    "classical fluid - solid couplings and instabilities such as vortex - induced vibrations , galloping and flutter in axial flows effectively act as energy extraction mechanisms as they enable an energy transfer from the incoming flow to the solid body , and can therefore be used to produce electricity using displacement - based ( e.g. electromagnetic converters ) or deformation - based ( e.g. piezoelectric materials ) conversion mechanisms @xcite . because they are based on fundamentally - different mechanisms , such flow energy harvesters may be attractive complements to the existing wind- and water - turbines technologies , and properly assessing fundamental upper bounds on their respective efficiency is therefore of critical importance .",
    "a flexible plate placed in an axial flow becomes unstable to flutter above a critical flow velocity when the destabilizing pressure forces dominate the stabilizing effect of the structure s rigidity @xcite .",
    "this critical velocity depends on the plate s properties ( e.g. density , size and rigidity ) and can therefore be adjusted in the system s design to be lower than the typical flow velocity .",
    "this so - called flapping flag instability leads to self - sustained large - amplitude flapping of the plate in the form of traveling bending waves @xcite , that can be used to produce electricity using , for example , piezoelectric patches attached to the plate s surface @xcite .",
    "an important research effort is required in order to assess the amount of energy that can be harvested using such devices and investigate possible intrinsic limits or potential optimization strategies of their efficiency . in a theoretical or numerical framework ,",
    "the conversion mechanism and output circuit must be described , to properly include the coupling of the fluid - solid and electric systems .",
    "energy harvesting eventually amounts to an extraction of energy from the solid dynamics .",
    "hence , a first and simpler model for the harvesting mechanism is an additional structural damping ( e.g. kelvin - voigt ) , and assessing the system s efficiency is then equivalent to determining how much energy can be dissipated by the flapping structure @xcite . indeed , increasing damping would lead to a larger energy dissipation but eventually will re - stabilize the system and reduce its harvesting efficiency .",
    "although simple to implement , this representation is not complete as it assumes that energy is instantaneously and immediately dissipated and can not represent the dynamics of the electrical circuit or of the coupling mechanism .    the originality of the present work is to propose instead a fully - coupled description of a fluid - solid - electric system , namely a flexible plate in axial flow covered with piezoelectric patch pairs powering simple resistive elements .",
    "recently , @xcite followed this approach to study the impact of the piezoelectric coupling on the linear stability of a two - dimensional plate and on the solid - electric energy transfers .",
    "in particular , the role of the tuning of the fluid - solid and electric characteristic time - scales was emphasized , and a destabilization by the piezoelectric coupling was identified in the case of large fluid loading , associated with the destabilization by damping of negative energy waves @xcite .",
    "the present study extends this approach to study numerically the nonlinear dynamics of this fluid - solid - electric system in the case of a slender flexible plate , and to determine its harvesting efficiency . here , the system s efficiency is defined following the classical definition used for wind - turbines , as the ratio of the mean power output and of the mean kinetic energy flux through the section occupied by the device in the flow . in that sense",

    "the plate is inextensible and clamped at its leading edge ; for simplicity , only purely planar motions of the plate are considered , so that the plate s position @xmath6 is only a function of the streamwise curvilinear coordinate @xmath7 and time @xmath8 , and the solid does not experience any spanwise displacement nor twist .",
    "the local orientation of the flag with respect to the horizontal axis is noted @xmath9 ( figure [ fig : piezoflag_schema ] ) . in the following",
    ", lineic quantities will be defined per unit length in @xmath7 .",
    "the surface of the plate is covered by pairs of piezoelectric patches ( figure  [ fig : piezoflag_schema]b ) with streamwise length @xmath10 and width @xmath1 .",
    "the negative electrodes of each patch are shunted through the plate and the positive electrodes are connected to the output circuit .",
    "the deformation of the flag is coupled to the output circuit through the piezoelectric coupling : ( i ) stretching and compression of the patches due to the local curvature induces charge transfers between each patch s electrodes and ( ii ) an electric voltage applied to its electrodes results in an additional internal torque on the piezoelectric patch and on the flag .",
    "considering the limit of a continuous coverage by patches of infinitesimal length @xcite , the local electric state can be described in terms of the electric voltage between the positive electrodes of each patch , @xmath11 , and the charge transfer @xmath12 per unit length in the streamwise direction . in this limit , which differs from the single - patch approach of @xcite ,",
    "both quantities are continuous functions of @xmath7 and @xmath8 , and the piezoelectric coupling imposes that : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the total internal torque in the piezoelectric flag , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the lineic capacitance and piezoelectric coupling coefficient , directly related to the material and geometric properties of the patch pair @xcite .",

    "@xmath27 is always strictly positive , and in permanent periodic regime , @xmath28 , with @xmath29 the time - averaging operator .",
    "the relative motion of the solid body with respect to the incoming flow results in fluid forces @xmath30 applied on its surface . in the particular limit of a slender body ( @xmath31 ) and for a purely potential flow ,",
    "the extension of lighthill s elongated body theory to large amplitude displacements leads to the following leading order expression for the reactive fluid forces @xmath32 associated with the local transverse motion of each cross section along the plate : @xmath33 with @xmath34 the non - dimensional added mass coefficient of the local cross - section , namely @xmath35 for a flat plate . in , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are respectively the tangential and normal components of the local relative velocity of the solid with respect to the incoming flow : @xmath38 initially proposed by @xcite , this so - called large amplitude elongated body theory ( laebt ) was recently shown to provide a good estimate of the transverse fluid forces , in comparison with rans simulations on a towed and deforming fish body @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite emphasized that this purely reactive formulation can not by itself represent properly the deformation amplitude of freely - moving bodies , as such effects as drag and separation will be significant and must be accounted for by an additional resistive component @xmath39 ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the case of a freely - flapping slender body",
    ", @xcite indeed observed that the purely reactive model would lead to non - physical overestimates of the flapping amplitude .",
    "following @xcite and @xcite , the present model only retains the resistive drag associated with the plate s normal displacement @xmath40 with @xmath41 for a flat plate in transverse flows .",
    "the reactive part of the laebt corresponds to the asymptotic limit of the potential flow equations when @xmath42 @xcite , but the recent work of @xcite showed nonetheless , using comparisons with wind - tunnel experiments , that the combination of the reactive and resistive components and can provide a good prediction of the flapping properties of the plate even when @xmath43 . in the following , an aspect ratio @xmath44 will therefore be considered .",

    "in fact , a kelvin  voigt damping model could only be recovered in the particular limit of @xmath59 and finite @xmath60 . however ,",
    "this asymptotic limit is unlikely to be achieved in practice because of the material restrictions on the coupling coefficient @xmath54 for currently - available piezoelectric materials @xcite .",
    "the linear stability of the piezoelectric flag is first analyzed to identify the impact of the piezoelectric coupling and output circuit on the stability properties of the system , and also identify the operating regime of the harvesting devices , namely the parameter values for which self - sustained oscillations can develop .",
    "the present linear study only differs from that in @xcite by the fluid model considered , that corresponds to a different range for the plate s aspect ratio , therefore only the main results will be reminded and the reader is referred to this previous contribution for more in - depth analysis of the linear stability .",

    "the piezoelectric coupling @xmath54 enables the transfer of energy from the fluid - solid system to the electrical circuit where part of it is dissipated , resulting in a net damping on the solid motion .",
    "this additional damping is therefore expected to increase the critical velocity in comparison with the uncoupled flag ( @xmath68 ) , an effect indeed observed for @xmath69 ( figure [ fig : threshold]a ) . at larger @xmath70 , the piezoelectric coupling instead destabilizes the system , at least initially .",
    "this destabilization by damping was previously reported in the case of a two - dimensional flag by @xcite , and is associated with the existence of negative energy waves in the local stability analysis of the non - dissipative flag @xcite . from an energy harvesting point of view , it increases the operating range of the piezoelectric flag as self - sustained oscillations develop for lower velocities .    for a fixed piezoelectric coupling",
    ", @xmath55 measures the tuning of the fluid - solid and electric time - scales of the system .",
    "when forced by the flag at a frequency much lower than @xmath71 ( @xmath59 ) , the output resistive elements are seen by the piezoelectric as short circuits , and the voltage at the electrodes remains negligible .",
    "the critical velocity is therefore equal to that of the uncoupled piezoelectric flag ( @xmath68 ) as no piezoelectric feedback is applied on the structure . for a large forcing frequency ( @xmath72 )",
    "however , the resistive elements are seen as open circuits , and from eq .",
    ", the voltage at the piezoelectric s electrodes is proportional and opposite to the curvature : the piezoelectric coverage then acts as an additional rigidity on the system . between these two limit regimes , a destabilization is observed for large @xmath70 which corresponds to the destabilization mechanism mentioned above ( figure [ fig : threshold]b ) .    these results confirm and extend to the slender - body limit the conclusions of the infinite - span flag analysis of @xcite .",
    "it is worth noting that the results obtained with both models differ mostly at low @xmath70 , consistently with the results of @xcite on the impact of aspect ratio on the flag stability .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the linear analysis of @xcite identified significant differences in the performance of lighter ( large @xmath70 ) or heavier flags ( small @xmath70 ) , as measured by the energy transfer from the structure to the output circuit .",
    "higher performance at large @xmath70 was associated with the destabilization by damping of negative energy waves .    a similar result is observed here in nonlinear simulations for the harvesting efficiency @xmath73 ( figures [ fig : eff_scanmu ] and [ fig : optim_mu ] ) : harvesting efficiencies up to @xmath74@xmath75 can be achieved for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , while the optimal value of @xmath73 is less than @xmath78 below @xmath79 .     as a function of the mass ratio @xmath70 and non - dimensional velocity @xmath53 for @xmath80 . for each value of @xmath70 and @xmath53 ,",
    "@xmath55 is chosen so as to maximize the harvesting efficiency .",
    "the black dashed line shows the minimum of the instability threshold over all possible values of @xmath55 , below which @xmath81 for all @xmath55 . ]    comparing figures [ fig : eff_scanmu](a ) and ( b ) , the optimal @xmath70 appears as closely related to the tuning parameter @xmath55 , emphasizing again the importance of the synchronization of the fluid - solid and electric systems : for small @xmath55 , regions of greater @xmath70 will be optimal as they correspond to larger flapping frequencies while heavier flags ( smaller @xmath70 ) will be optimal for larger values of @xmath55 .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : optim_mu ] shows the optimal - tuning efficiency as a function of ( @xmath70,@xmath53 ) . up to @xmath75 of the kinetic energy flux can be harvested for the largest value of @xmath70 and @xmath53 considered .",
    "however , it is also important to emphasize that this parameter region corresponds to closely - spaced mode switching events , making the efficiency of the system quite sensitive to fluctuations in the flow velocity .",
    "the coupling coefficient @xmath54 is a measure of the intensity of the fluid - solid and electric systems forcing on each other , and as such is clearly expected to impact the amount of energy transferred to the output load .",
    "figure [ fig : alpha ] shows the evolution of @xmath82 and @xmath73 when @xmath54 is increased . for small coupling @xmath83 ,",
    "the flapping dynamics is only marginally modified and the amplitude of the charge transfer @xmath84 and electric potential @xmath85 increase linearly with @xmath54 as seen in eq .  .",
    "as a result , @xmath86 and @xmath73 initially increase quadratically with @xmath54 ( see inset on figure [ fig : alpha ] ) . however , when @xmath54 is increased further the feedback piezoelectric coupling modifies the flapping dynamics resulting in a linear decrease of the flapping amplitude and harvesting efficiency and , eventually , the restabilization of the system .",
    "one can therefore identify an optimal value of the coupling coefficient , in the same way that an optimal damping was determined for maximum energy dissipation in @xcite .",
    "the value of the optimal coefficient @xmath87 clearly depends on the other system parameters , and will be greater when the flag is far from its stability threshold before piezoelectric coupling is introduced , or when destabilization by damping occurs as for larger @xmath70 .",
    "( dashed ) and harvesting efficiency @xmath73 ( solid ) with the coupling coefficient @xmath54 for @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "the inset show the efficiency s scaling with @xmath54 in the limit of @xmath83 and @xmath91 with @xmath92 the critical value of @xmath54 leading to restabilization of the piezoelectric flag for those parameter values . ]",
    "achieving the optimal @xmath54 is however not necessarily possible practically : @xmath54 is a characteristic of the material s electric and mechanical properties and is of the order @xmath93 for typical piezoelectric materials such as pzt and even lower for pvdf @xcite . except in the vicinity of the instability threshold",
    ", the optimal @xmath54 leading to maximum energy efficiency is however expected to be greater than this value , suggesting that an optimization of the piezoelectric flag design or future technical improvements in the properties of available piezoelectric materials can potentially increase the achievable values of @xmath54 and lead to significant efficiency gains .",
    "the present study focused on the fully - coupled dynamics of a classical fluid - solid system , a flexible plate in axial flow , and a simple resistive circuit coupled through piezoelectric patches attached to the surface of the plate and converting the plate s bending deformation into an electric current . in the limit of continuous coverage by infinitesimal patches ,",
    "the energy harvesting efficiency was determined as a function of the different system parameters , namely the inertia ratio , the non - dimensional flow velocity , the coupling coefficient and the tuning ratio . for realistic coupling coefficients ,",
    "as much as @xmath94 of the kinetic energy flux can be transmitted to the output circuit , but this efficiency was found to be highly sensitive to several important parameters , in particular the coupling coefficient and the flow velocity .",
    "this study confirms the results by @xcite on the impact of destabilization by damping and on the solid - electric energy transfers : in nonlinear saturated regimes , those parameter regions correspond indeed to maximum energy harvesting efficiency . the critical role played by the tuning ratio",
    "is also confirmed : maximum energy transfers are obtained when the output circuit characteristic timescale is tuned to the flapping frequency .",
    "this frequency is itself determined through the nonlinear coupling of the fluid , solid and electric systems , and modifications in the flapping frequency associated with a switch in the flapping mode directly impact the efficiency of the system and its robustness to fluctuations in flow velocity for example .",
    "controlling the flapping mode selection is therefore an important challenge for the improvement of the efficiency of this model energy harvester , and should be considered in future work .    by coupling the fluid , solid and electric systems in a nonlinear model and by using an explicit description of the coupling mechanism and output circuit",
    ", the present approach provides some important insight on the nature and importance of the feedback of energy harvesting on the solid dynamics , as illustrated by the modification of the flapping amplitude and frequency , for example .",
    "even though the simplest possible circuit ( a purely resistive element ) was used here , the impact of the tuning ratio @xmath55 on the efficiency suggests that significant efficiency gains should be expected through a careful design of the output circuit , using more complex and possibly active circuits , as well as state - of - the - art power electronics techniques such as synchronized switching techniques @xcite ."
