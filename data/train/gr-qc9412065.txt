    "a notable development in the ongoing study of the black hole evaporation problem@xcite is that there is now a two dimensional model which admits physically sensible evaporating black hole solutions @xcite , at least for much of the process .",
    "in@xcite , it was shown that if the radiation in the scalar degrees of freedom which produce a black - hole like object , has positive energy , there must be a global event horizon or a naked singularity .",
    "this was a general argument which did not depend upon the precise fine - tuning of the model : only the general form of the global structure was determined .",
    "if a spacetime has a global event horizon or a naked singularity , one can say through reasonable qualitative statements that the former case implies loss of quantum coherence , while the latter would lead to an even worse breakdown of predictability .",
    "whilst such qualitative arguments are convincing , at least at the semi - classical level , ( a consideration of superselection sectors in a third quantised framework@xcite may lead to other possibilities ) , one would like to prepare explicit calculations which show that some physical quantity changes during the evolution of a spacetime in such a way that it is clearly seen whether there is loss of information .",
    "the quantity usually considered is the entropy .",
    "a good question then is how to relate the entropy changes to information loss@xcite .",
    "this will be considered elsewhere .    here",
    "a particular model is considered , and the behaviour of its quantitative entropy . the euclidean method for calculating the entropy",
    "is described , and compared with that of another method .",
    "the change in entropy during the lifetime of the class of black holes formed by the collapse of a shock wave is then calculated .",
    "this expression shows that the formation and evaporation of a black hole causes the entropy to increase for all positive energy incoming pulses .",
    "one can also show that the entropy is always increasing , that is , these solutions obey a second law .",
    "in this section , a model which has been discussed many times in the literature@xcite is discussed , but here the necessary boundary term for the variational problem to be well - posed and for the thermodynamics to be derived using the euclidean formalism is included .",
    "the quantum effects of the minimal scalars are represented by introducing an independent scalar field which mimics the trace anomaly of the matter fields , and also makes the effective action local , thus simplifying the calculation of the field equations .",
    "the effective action needed is the following:-    @xmath0 -\\frac 1 { \\pi } \\int d \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pm h } k\\tilde\\chi    \\label{eq : sm}\\ ] ]    where @xmath1    the fields present are the metric , @xmath2 , the dilaton , @xmath3 , the scalar field @xmath4 , and the classical minimal scalars .",
    "the pair of terms involving z in the volume term of this action have replaced the usual polyakov@xcite term @xmath5 this is multiplied by r and integrated in the action([eq : sm ] ) and arises from the matter fields contribution to the associated path integral .",
    "the trace anomaly of the z - scalar field is that of the n minimal scalars . there is a boundary term which defines the variational problem properly .",
    "the equations of motion are @xmath6    @xmath7    @xmath8    and the minimal scalars obey the wave equation . more information about the form of the z field can be deduced from these equations . if one takes the trace of the gravitational field equation , and uses ( [ eq : bz ] ) , one finds that @xmath9 .",
    "but eqn.([eq : bz ] ) then implies that @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a solution of the wave equation . if one were to introduce the conformal factor @xmath12 , which appears in the conformal metric in the form @xmath13 then one has @xmath14 so that the z field is clearly related to the conformal factor by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is another solution of the wave equation",
    ". also , evidently , the conformal factor and the dilaton have to differ only by such a solution , which depends on gauge .",
    "about twenty years ago , a close mathematical analogy between thermodynamics and the mechanics of black holes was noticed by bekenstein@xcite .",
    "the calculations of hawking @xcite then put this analogy on a safer footing by supplying constants of proportionality . hawking and",
    "gibbons@xcite showed how to use the euclidean continuation of a spacetime to derive its entropy .",
    "one first writes down the amplitude for a field configuration @xmath17 at time @xmath18 to another field configuration @xmath19 at time @xmath20 .",
    "this is @xmath21 e^{ii(\\phi ) }     \\label{eq : pa}\\ ] ] if one now lets @xmath22 be purely imaginary , identifies the initial and final field configurations , and sums over all possible states , the result is the partition function for the field on the euclidean spacetime , at temperature @xmath23 @xmath24 \\exp[-i\\hat i ( \\phi)]=z   \\label{eq : paa}\\ ] ]    once the identification of the thermodynamic partition function has been made , one can proceed as usual to derive other thermodynamical quantities , such as the entropy .",
    "this is done by finding the dominant contribution to the partition function and then substituting into the usual formula for the entropy : @xmath25    consider a euclidean solution with an inner boundary just outside the horizon .",
    "one could identify this spacetime with any period . evaluating",
    "the action shows that it is proportional to the period .",
    "thus from ( [ eq : sb])the entropy will be zero . if however the period,@xmath26,is taken to be that value which removes the conical singularity at the origin , one can remove the inner boundary .",
    "this changes the topology and reduces the action by the surface term at the origin evaluated such that the conical singularity is removed .",
    "this quantity is independent of @xmath26 .",
    "one can interpret this reduction in the action as corresponding to an increase in the partition function which in turn corresponds to an increase in the entropy .",
    "this will be equal to the term described above , as can be seen from ( [ eq : sb ] ) .",
    "this point will be discussed further in @xcite .    in this derivation ,",
    "one effectively considers the entropy defined at a given instant , making the approximation that the evaporation is quasi - static .",
    "the z - field accounts for the dynamics of the solution and appears in the formula for the entropy .",
    "one is in effect comparing the real solution with a sequence static black holes with the same values of @xmath3 and z on the horizon .    in the case of the rst model one finds for the on - shell action , @xmath27 where @xmath1    there are inner and outer boundaries , but only the inner one contributes .",
    "the terms involving k are those which have come from the surface term , and will be all those which contribute to the entropy .",
    "this is because the 1-volume of the inner boundary tends to zero , and the other terms are regular there . as explained above , one takes the period such that the horizon point is regular , which is necessary for a sensible euclidean spacetime . ]    to evaluate ( [ eq : ion ] ) , suitable coordinates in euclidean signature are :    @xmath28    the coordinate transformations needed to transform from kruskal conformal coordinates to ( [ eq : eucmet ] ) are @xmath29 , so that @xmath30 and @xmath31 in these coordinates , @xmath32 and the trace of the second fundamental form k for a circular boundary is given by @xmath33    one finds that the action is @xmath34    since the period is identified with @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the action becomes @xmath37    this , as explained above , is the entropy .",
    "this is the result one obtains using the noether charge method .",
    "this was expected as the two methods , though apparently very dissimilar , are equivalent@xcite as was mentioned before .    as the black hole loses mass , the value of the dilaton on the horizon decreases@xcite .",
    "the dilaton terms in the entropy correspond to the classical and quantum terms due to the black hole itself .",
    "the z - field term includes the effects of the radiation .",
    "as z increases on the horizon , it compensates for the reduction in internal entropy .",
    "how the radiation term increases is a measure of the inefficiency of information retrieval from the black hole . for thermal radiation ,",
    "its rate of increase should be a maximum , _",
    "i.e. _ any other kind of radiation should give a slower rate of increase .",
    "if the difference between these rates is large enough , then it might be possible that all the information which went into producing the black hole would be retrieved , albeit in a form very difficult to collect . in terms",
    "the entropy , this would be described by the case where the radiation terms exactly cancelled the changes due to the internal contributions .",
    "it is clear that in the exact rst shockwave solutions , the radiation is no longer exactly thermal@xcite .",
    "thus , they must radiate _ some _ information about the initial state , if only a bit .",
    "since our formula ( [ eq : loopp ] ) is derived using the quasi - static approximation , and the evolving rst solutions are not strictly quasi - static , the statements one can make about the entropy changes found in the following chapter are really only guidelines .",
    "one should rather consider a series of static black holes with the same values of dilaton and z - field on the horizon , but with decreasing mass .",
    "we now calculate the entropy for solutions describing the evolution of spacetime after a shockwave of positive energy , m , is sent in from past right infinity . these form black holes which evaporate away to nothing in a finite lifetime .",
    "this is done in the conformal gauge , and in double null coordinates , _",
    "i.e. _ the metric is @xmath38 since the z field obeys ( [ eq : zq ] ) , where @xmath16 is a solution of the wave equation , the field equations in terms of the new variables @xmath39 and @xmath40 used by rst , are unchanged .",
    "it seems not possible to write the local rst model in variables which reduce it to a liouville - like model .",
    "therefore , the usual transformation(see @xcite ) are used .",
    "the definitions of the new variables are @xmath41 @xmath42 and the volume part of the action becomes @xmath43 the field equations for the action ( [ eq : sm ] ) reduce neatly to the following form @xmath44 @xmath45 with constraint equations @xmath46 where the functions @xmath47 are chosen so that for a given solution to the field equations the constraint equations are satisfied .",
    "the last term on the left hand side is summed over n matter fields .",
    "one can fix the remaining coordinate freedom left in the conformal gauge by setting @xmath48 , which is the kruskal gauge , @xmath49 in terms of the old variables . the general solutions for infalling matter are @xmath50 where m is the @xmath51-dependent kruskal energy - momentum tensor @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the total incoming momentum up to the advanced time @xmath51 given by @xmath54 solutions for which @xmath55 are considered .",
    "these are incoming shock waves at @xmath56 , with total energy m.    in order to find s , one must fix z by imposing initial conditions along a cauchy surface .",
    "this is done in such a way that corresponds to no incoming particles from right infinity except for the shockwave , and none in spacetime before the shock .",
    "these are the same conditions that were applied to the z - field introduced in @xcite , which are shown in fig.1 ; in this case , however , although the energy - momentum tensor still mimics the trace anomaly of the minimal scalars , one is now of course treating a particular model rather than the general form in two dimensions .",

    "the apparent horizon is defined by @xmath65 .",
    "this gives , in terms of the chosen kruskal coordinates , @xmath66 to express the total entropy change from start to finish , the coordinates of the endpoint are also required .",
    "this is found simply by solving simultaneously with ( [ eq : ah ] ) the equation for the singularity ( which is on the line where @xmath67 which gives @xmath68 and so @xmath69 ) .",
    "this yields for the endpoint @xmath70 @xmath71 the above agrees with @xcite . knowing the beginning and endpoints of the apparent horizon one can substitute into the entropy formula to find the overall change .",
    "this turns out to be @xmath72 this expression is positive for all positive values of m. for large values of @xmath73 it increases arbitrarily , and as @xmath73 tends to zero , it goes to zero . for fixed @xmath73 , but with the number @xmath74 of matter fields going to infinity , the entropy change diverges .",
    "this result depends upon choosing the right boundary conditions for the z field , the correct vacuum state .",
    "myers@xcite obtains equivalent results by considering the appropriate conformal transformation ( to the flat asymptotic vacuum coordinates ) on the @xmath75 term which appears in his entropy formula .",
    "this adds precisely the contribution to the entropy which the function @xmath11 gives in the z - field analysis used here .    to see that the entropy is always increasing for these shockwave solutions as the advanced time increases on the horizons",
    ", one can simply write the entropy as a function of @xmath76 , and finds that , @xmath77 and @xmath78 both of which clearly increase with advanced time .",
    "this is a second law for these solutions on both the apparent and event horizons .",
    "in@xcite a second law is proved to exist more generally ( _ i.e. _ all solutions ( [ eq : gen ] ) ) for this model .",
    "now that there is a semi - classical model which describes black holes which evaporate , and which is simple enough to yield exact solutions , though not quite in the simplest and most directly handlable way , the immediate task is to extend the classical theory thermodynamics of black holes , to cover the new dynamical situations of the recent models . this is being done , and has been applied here for the local , well - posed rst model .",
    "consider an empty spacetime , whose entropy at some advanced time is normalised to zero , say .",
    "send in matter at the speed of light at this time forming a black hole , and attribute to it an intrinsic entropy . at a later advanced time ,",
    "the black hole ceases to be , but the quantity we called the entropy has risen above zero , and to what extent it has done so depends on how energetic was the original pulse of energy , the number of degrees of freedom we allow for the carriage of radiation to infinity , and the model with which we are working . once the black hole has disappeared , we are presumably back to the same spacetime geometry that we began with , but the entropy has increased .",
    "we need to know how this quantity is relevant to information loss .",
    "an increase in entropy is normally taken to be associated with a loss of information@xcite .",
    "properly defined , the entropy corresponding to ` missing information ' for matter in a pure state , which is finely monitored , should remain constant , although in _ practice _ this monitoring is never possible , and the coarse - graining then allows energy to degrade . if there is a black hole , formed from pure - state matter , and no amount of monitoring could prevent this entropy increasing in the course of evaporation , then information is said to be lost in _",
    "principle_. that is , no one to one map exists between the initial state preparation and future infinity after the black hole has disappeared .    in further work",
    ", we shall consider the question of how to quantify the loss of information which appears to occur in the semi - classical black hole theory .",
    "what seems needed is a clarifying study of information theory uesful to black hole physicists . in what relation",
    "does ` information ' stand to the ` entropy ' of black hole mechanics .",
    "this latter can be related to the scattering properties of black holes - which are themselves rather difficult concepts - and can be derived directly from the action , the starting point for most two dimensional models .",
    "this work will be the third of three linked papers of which this is the second and @xcite , which considered the general theory of scattering and coherence in two dimensional semi - classical theory , was the first .    in bekenstein",
    "s work@xcite , formulae which relate the rate of black hole intrinsic entropy change directly to rate of information retrieval are used .",
    "that is , the deviations from thermality of the radiation from a black hole are directly proportional to the information retrieval rate .",
    "it is known that there are such deviations , from the work on two - dimensional models@xcite .",
    "thus if we can determine what these correspond to , then we can see whether the black hole can re - emit all its information , at least at in the approximation in which our present notion of spacetime geometry is unchanged .",
    "it seems , however that the information stored in these non - thermal modes is limited@xcite .",
