    "in @xcite , sullivan introduced multiple notions of _ tautness _ of a foliation , and proved the equivalence of these notions for @xmath3 foliations .",
    "the conceptually simplest of these was highlighted further by gabai ( cf , definition  2.11 of @xcite ) .",
    "when @xmath4 is only @xmath0 , definition  2.11 of @xcite admits two natural interpretations .",
    "moreover , the notions of tautness introduced by sullivan are distinct when the criterion that @xmath5 be @xmath3 is dropped .    in this paper",
    "we describe several notions of tautness that arise in the study of @xmath0 foliations , @xmath1 or smoother foliations , and in geometry .",
    "we examine how these notions are related , and give examples in   [ examples ] to show that these notions are different .",
    "the implications of the differences between versions of tautness are clearest in geometry and contact topology .",
    "we show in proposition  [ no vp flow ] that some smoothly taut foliations are not transverse to a volume preserving flow , whereas by theorem  [ vp flow ] , @xmath1 everywhere taut foliations are always transverse to such flows .    in theorem",
    "[ limit of both ] we construct smoothly taut @xmath2 foliations that are @xmath0 approximated both by overtwisted contact structures and by everywhere taut foliations .",
    "this contrasts sharply with theorem  [ everwheretautimplies ] which shows that @xmath1 everywhere taut foliations are @xmath0 approximated by , and only by , weakly symplectically fillable , universally tight contact structures .",
    "since topologically taut @xmath0 foliations are isotopic to everywhere taut @xmath2 foliations ( corollary  [ top approx ] ) , the differences between the versions of tautness are unimportant when working with foliations up to topological conjugacy . in particular , for example , an @xmath6-space does not admit a transversely orientable , topologically taut , @xmath0 foliation ( corollary  [ l space ] ) .",
    "this study was inspired by an observation of vincent colin , who pointed out to us that if @xmath4 is only continuous , then @xmath4 is not uniquely integrable and this impacts the existence of transversals .",
    "we thank vincent for helpful conversations , and in particular for explaining his work , @xcite , where these issues arise in the search for a foliation approximated by a pair of contact structures .",
