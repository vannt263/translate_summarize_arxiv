    "we investigate the spatial profile of the fine - structure lines in the two - dimensional spectrum of g095 , but the double shell structure is not confirmed possibly due to an insufficient spatial resolution ( fwhm@xmath310@xmath15.48 ) .",
    "the size of the envelope shell in the n11.7 image suggests that the n11.7 emission mainly comes from the outer shell with some contribution from the inner shell .",

    "the profile of the broad feature around 12@xmath1 m shows the same spatial variation of the n11.7 image .",
    "however , the surface brightness of the 11.3@xmath1 m pah feature increases from regions 1 to 5 ( from north to south ) and the intensity of the pah feature in region 5 is twice as strong as that in region 1 .",

    "the [ ] emission has peaks at regions 2 and 3 , while the [ ] is strong at regions 1 and 5 .",
    "the intensity ratio of the pah features are often used to diagnose the ionization and excitation conditions of pahs .",
    "the 6.2 to 11.3@xmath1 m and 7.7 to 11.3@xmath1 m band ratios are about 1.8 and 2.8 , respectively .",
    "these ratios become large when pahs are ionized @xcite .",
    "the 6.2 to 11.3@xmath1 m and the 7.7 to 11.3@xmath1 m band ratios of typical galactic pne range from 0.5 to 3.5 and from 1.0 to 6.5 , respectively @xcite .",
    "these ratios suggest that the ionization of pahs in g095 is intermediate among galactic pne .",
    "the 11.3 to 3.3@xmath1 m band ratio is used to estimate the excitation of pahs . since the 3.3@xmath1 m feature requires a high excitation of pahs , the band ratio becomes small when the excitation of pahs becomes high .",
    "the ratio of g095 is about 3.0 , while @xcite reported that the typical 11.3 to 3.3@xmath1 m band ratio ranges from 3 to 4 .",
    "the small 11.3 to 3.3@xmath1 m band ratio of g095 suggests that the pah excitation in g095 is high .",
    "it seems consistent with the hard radiation field of pne . on the other hand ,",
    "the destruction of small pahs increases the 11.3 to 3.3@xmath1 m ratio as discussed in @xcite .",
    "the small ratio of g095 also suggests that pahs in g095 are still intact in spite of the hard radiation fields .    to investigate the carrier of the broad feature around 12@xmath1 m",
    ", we plot the spectrum of ic418 , which is a pn with the 12@xmath1 m feature @xcite , in figure  [ fig : satellitespec ] by the thick gray line .",
    "the broad features of g095 and ic418 show almost the same spectral profiles .",
    "@xcite also investigate the 12@xmath1 m feature of pne in mcs .",
    "the peak position and wavelength range of the broad feature of g095 are consistent with those of the 12@xmath1 m feature reported in @xcite .",
    "thus , we conclude that the broad feature in the irs spectrum has the same origin of the 12@xmath1 m features discussed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the 12@xmath1 m feature is generally attributed to silicon carbide ( sic ) grains ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "alternatively , @xcite tentatively attribute the broad feature around 12@xmath1 m to aliphatic carbons .",
    "if the 12@xmath1 m feature of g095 arises from aliphatic carbons , we expect the aliphatic feature at 3.4@xmath1 m .",
    "however , the irc spectrum of g095 does not show any feature around 3.4@xmath1 m .",
    "it does not support the aliphatic origin of the 12@xmath1 m feature of g095 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the 12@xmath1 m feature of g095 is attributable to sic grains .",
    "the 12@xmath1 m feature is seldom detected in galactic pne .",
    "pne in mcs show the 12@xmath1 m feature more frequently than galactic pne @xcite .",
    "@xcite point out that the typical dust temperature of carbon - rich pne in lmc is higher than that of galactic carbon - rich pne .",
    "frequent detection of the 12@xmath1 m feature in pne in mcs is attributable to their high dust temperature .",
    "we expect that the dust temperature in g095 is sufficiently high to show the 12@xmath1 m feature based on the small size of g095 .",
    "g095 has the blue _ iras _ 25 to 60@xmath1 m color of about 2.0 , while the ratio is typically about 0.7 for galactic pne @xcite .",
    "it also supports the high dust temperature of g095 .",
    "the most simple explanation of the difference between regions 1 and 5 is that the amount of pahs is different between the northern and southern parts of g095 .",
    "it may result from efficient pah formation in the southern part , or pah destruction in the northern part .",
    "however , there is no observation to support the scenario .",
    "the strength of the 12@xmath1 m feature and underlying continuum emissions , both of which can be attributed to carbonaceous dust grains , do not show a large difference between the northern and southern part of g095 .",
    "it suggests that the formation of carbonaceous grains does not differ between the northern and southern regions .",
    "if the emission from ionized gas is enhanced in the northern region , there can be pah destruction .",
    "however , the 6@xmath9 cm free  free emission in the northern part is as strong as that in the southern region @xcite .",
    "the [ ] to [ ] intensity ratio does not show a significant difference between the northern and southern regions .",
    "in addition , the 11.3 to 3.3@xmath1 m pah band ratio does not support pah destruction in g095 .",
    "although we can not completely rule out the possibility that the southern region has a large amount of pahs , there is no observational evidence for it .",
    "we propose that the uv absorption within the dust envelope can explain the difference in the strength of the pah feature between regions 1 and 5 .",
    "since pahs require the uv photons to be excited , a different amount of uv photons could explain the different strength of the pah feature .",
    "assuming that pahs coexist with other dust grains in the nebula , uv radiation can be absorbed by dust grains before it excites pahs .",
    "the amount of the uv photons to excite pahs is estimated by @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the optical depth to the central star at the uv wavelengths . the dust column density in the northern region",
    "is suggested to be higher by about 10% than that in the southern region from the comics observation .",
    "assuming that @xmath33 in the northern region is 10% larger than in the southern region , the amount of the uv photon in the southern region can be twice larger than in the northern region when @xmath34 .",
    "thus , we expect that g095 is optically thick in the uv .",
    "the color index of g095 is @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath36 and the intrinsic color @xmath37 , the amount of the extinction without the interstellar extinction ( @xmath38 from @xcite ) is roughly estimated as @xmath39 , corresponding to @xmath40 or @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the estimated optical depth is sufficiently large to quantitatively explain the difference in the strength of the 11.3@xmath1 m pah feature between regions 1 and 5 .",
    "thus , a small asymmetry in the amount of dust ( @xmath3110% ) can result in a large difference in the intensity of the pah feature .",
    "the present results suggest that we have to consider the uv absorption within the nebula to investigate the pah features in young pne , such as g095 .",
    "we speculate that part of the mid - infrared spectral sequence from ppne to pne can be explained in terms of the uv absorption even if there is no assumption of dust processing . in the early phase of the sequence ,",
    "the circumstellar nebula is small and dense so that it can be optically thick in the uv .",
    "nearly all the uv photons are absorbed at the inner surface of the dust envelope and pahs are not excited efficiently .",
    "the small size of the nebula leads to dust temperature high enough to produce the 12@xmath1 m feature . as the nebula expands along the evolution , the optical depth in the uv and the dust temperature decrease .",
    "pahs start to be excited by the uv photons and the pah features are efficiently emitted .",
    "the drop in the dust temperature results in a decrease of the 12@xmath1 m feature .",
    "consequently , the mid - infrared spectrum becomes dominated by the strong pah emission .",
    "the advent of the pah features and the disappearance of the 12@xmath1 m feature of the mid - infrared spectral sequence can be interpreted in terms of the uv absorption within the nebula and the nebular expansion .",
    "we investigate the pah features of g095 based on the infrared images and spectra .",
    "we detect the pah features and the 12@xmath1 m feature in the irc and irs spectra .",
    "we obtain the mid - infrared image and spatially resolved spectra in the @xmath14-band with the _ subaru_/comics .",
    "the surface brightness of the 11.3@xmath1 m pah feature in the southern region is twice stronger than in the northern region , while the 11.7@xmath1 m image and the 12@xmath1 m feature do not show a large difference between the northern and southern parts of the nebula .",
    "we propose that the difference in the strength of the pah feature is caused by the uv absorption of the dust envelope rather than the chemical processing of carbonaceous dust .",
    "the present results suggest that the uv absorption within the nebula is needed to be taken into account in the investigation of the mid - infrared spectrum of ppne and young pne .",
    "we propose the scenario to account for the mid - infrared spectral transition seen in the evolution from ppne to pne in terms of the uv absorption and the nebular expansion without assuming any dust processing .",
    "the mid - infrared spectral evolution in a transition from ppne to pne involves the evolution of nebulosity as well as the processing of dust grains .",
    "we propose that the change in the uv absorption within the nebula can significantly affect the mid - infrared spectrum .",
    "further studies will confirm that the proposed scenario is applicable to other ppne and young pne .",
