    "uncertainty relation ( principle ) as one of the well - known fundamental principles in quantum mechanics shows that anyone is not able to simultaneously specify the values of the non - commuting and canonically conjugated observables @xcite .",
    "it is also one of the keys that highlights the difference between the quantum and classical worlds .",
    "uncertainty relation not only has a wide range of applications such as entanglement detections @xcite , security analysis @xcite , signal processing @xcite and so on , but also has been developed based on different considerations such as the noise - disturbance uncertainty ozawa1,ozawa6,ozawa7,ozawa9 , the entropic uncertainty wehner , deutsch , kraus , uffink , renyi , inade , k - entropy , smooth , fan , shu , qiao , the uncertainty with memory @xcite , the uncertainty of successive measurements @xcite or joint measurements werner2,werner5,werner6,wernerz and so on .",
    "in fact , uncertainty relations and uncertainty principles have been well distinguished in ref .",
    "the former refers to the measurements performed on the identical preparations of the state , so one measurement can never induce the disturbance on the other measurement ; the latter considers the measurement disturbance induced by the apparatus or the impossible joint measurements of incompatible observables @xcite . here",
    "we mainly consider the uncertainty relations .",
    "the most popular version of the uncertainty relation ( in many textbooks ) is the kennard - robertson inequality @xcite which shows the product of the variances of two observables are lower bounded as follows .",

    "it is obvious that the right - hand - side vanishes if the expectation value of the commutator vanishes , even though @xmath2 and @xmath4 do nt commute with each other",
    ". later the inequality ( [ 1a ] ) was further improved by schr@xmath5dinger who added an anti - commutator contribution into the right - hand - side of eq .",

    "however , it can be easily found that both eq .",

    "( [ pati1 ] ) is selected such that the term is positive .",
    "when more than two observables are considered , the relevant uncertainty relations are also introduced @xcite . since all the aforementioned uncertainty relations ( eqs .",
    "( [ 1a],[2a],[patis ] ) ) are just the quantitative expression for the nonexistence of common eigenstates in incompatible observables , one can find that the lower bound ( eq .",
    "( patis ) ) in qubit system is just a rewriting of the left - hand side of eq.([patis ] ) for a qubit system , even though it could also be of significance in some particular cases .",
    "the details about this analysis and the generalized rewriting for all systems are given in methods .",
    "so it remains an interesting question how to present genuine tight enough bounds instead of the potential rewriting .    in this paper",
    ", we give a perfect answer to this question by presenting the arbitrarily tight and nontrivial upper and lower bounds on the `` weighted - like '' sum of variances of two observables based on the quantum superposition principle .",
    "the characteristic our bounds is that our bounds include some free adjustable parameters , which leads to three obvious advantages : ( 1 ) the bounds can always be adjusted to be nontrivial at any case ; ( 2 ) the tightness of the bounds can be effectively controlled by the free parameters as we expect ; ( 3 ) all the free parameters does not obviously depend on the state and observables covered in the uncertainty relation .",
    "since our method can introduce free parameters into the bounds , another potential advantage is that any nontrivial bound can always serve as a tight enough bound .",
    "this advantage can be well manifested in the case of multiple observables . as we know",
    ", uncertainty relations with two observables can automatically induce the corresponding uncertainty relations with more than two observables , however , one usually needs to consider the different combinations of observables and find their maximum value in order to obtain a tight bound .",
    "this is quite complicated with the increasing number of observables .",
    "but it can be found that if employing our method , one can only consider any one simple and nontrivial bound .",
    "here we also provide the alternative upper and lower bounds of the sum of their variances .",
    "it is shown that these two bounds have also the controllable tightness .",
    "the tightness of our bounds for the uncertainty relation with two or more observables are demonstrated by an example , respectively .",

    "( [ main ] ) is just a trivial equality and it does not denote any uncertainty relation .",
    "so neither @xmath41 nor @xmath42 is valid in our theorem",
    ". however , the trivial case tells us very useful information .",

    "( lim2 ) . ) . in this sense",
    ", we say that our upper and lower bounds are arbitrarily tight .",
    "the intuitive illustration of the tightness can also be given by an example in fig .",
    "nontrivial_.- to show the bounds are not trivial , one can analyze the bounds @xmath28 .",
    "however , here we will do it by an easy and direct method . at first",
    ", we should note that for a given uncertainty relation , the parameters @xmath37 , @xmath38 , the observables @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the quantum state @xmath15 are fixed .",
    "so one will easily show that @xmath45 does not vanish for nonsingular @xmath37 and @xmath38 unless @xmath15 happens to be the common eigenstate of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this is a normal case since @xmath26 has been the common state .",
    "now , we suppose @xmath47 is , one can always find proper free parameters such that @xmath48 and especially we can let @xmath49 infinitely approach @xmath50 .",
    "this means that we can always find such a @xmath51 so long as @xmath52 , that is , @xmath53 is not trivial .",
    "but although the upper bound @xmath54 does not provide an uncertainty relation in general , it serves as a complementary constraint on the @xmath45 .    .",
    "the bounds are always non - negative and the two endpoints show our arbitrarily tight upper and lower bounds . ]    to intuitively illustrate the arbitrary tightness of the bounds , we use matlab 2014b to randomly generate a 4-dimensional quantum pure state @xmath55^t$ ] and two observables @xmath56 and @xmath57 with @xmath58 @xmath59 @xmath60 and @xmath61 in addition , we also randomly generate two complex numbers @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( throughout the paper all the randomly generated numbers come from matlab 2014b . we wo nt mention it again ) . in order to show that the two bounds can reach the exact value of the sum of variances when @xmath64 or @xmath65 vanishes",
    ", we impose another condition , @xmath66 .",
    "all the other free parameters are randomly generated .",
    "here , we calculate the bounds in two cases . in the first case , we let these parameters be separately given as @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 when @xmath70 . in the second case , we let the parameters be given as @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 when @xmath42 . the final upper bound is given by the smaller one of the two cases and the lower bound is given by the larger one , which are plotted in fig.1",
    ". one can find that at the two endpoints ( corresponding to @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively ) , the two bounds are consistent with @xmath45 .",
    "so an arbitrarily small deviation of the two endpoints will provide a corresponding arbitrarily tight bound .",
    "this well shows the arbitrary tightness of the bounds .",
    "when more than two observables are taken into account , one will have to consider the uncertainty relation with multiple observables .",
    "although uncertainty relation with two observables can automatically induce the corresponding uncertainty relations with more than two observables , one has to consider the different combinations of observables and find a maximal lower bound in order to reach a better tightness .",
    "looking for proper combinations will become a complex job with the increasing number of observables .",
    "it is obvious that if our previous technique could be applied in this case , it will greatly reduce the complexity .",
    "this is because the bounds will have arbitrary tightness once we find proper bounds using our technique .",
    "next we present alternative lower and upper bounds for the sum of the variances of multiple observables .",

    "next we explain the two uncertainty bounds are also arbitrary tight and the lower bound is nontrivial .",
    "one can find that the inequalities come from the cauchy - schwartz inequality which is saturated when either all @xmath81 or all @xmath82 are simultaneously vanish . with a single formula",
    ", one can express this condition just as eq .",
    "( [ limp ] ) for nontrivial bounds .",
    "thus , based on the continuous dependence on the parameters @xmath81 and @xmath82 , one can draw the conclusion that both the bounds can be adjusted in the vicinities of @xmath83 and @xmath84 such that they infinitely approach the sum of variances so long as the sum does not vanish .",
    "so the bounds are arbitrary tight .",
    "similarly , just because of the arbitrary tightness , it implies that the lower bound will not be trivial since the vanishing sum of the variances is not a trivial condition for whether the considered state is the common eigenstate of the observables .     with various bounds vs. the parameter @xmath85 of the quantum state .",
    "the arbitrary tightness of our bounds is embodied by that the bounds can infinitely approach to the exact sov .",
    "this also demonstrates the powerful technique we used here . ]    in order to demonstrate tightness of our bounds , we consider an example including four observables operated on a pure state . simultaneously",
    ", we also compare our upper bound ( ub ) and lower bound ( lb ) in eq .",
    "( [ theo2 ] ) with the sum of the variances ( sov ) and the bounds separately given in ref .",
    "pati ( pb ) and ref .",
    "@xcite ( fb ) . here",
    "the measured state is given by @xmath86^t$ ] with a randomly generated phase @xmath87 .",
    "the four observables are supposed to be @xmath88 and @xmath89 which is also randomly generated .    in principle , in order to get an ideally tight bound on the sum of the variances , one should find the global maximum of all the potential lower bounds .",
    "here we only provide several lower bounds .",
    "first , directly applying our theorem 2 , one can easily find the upper bound and the lower bound on the four observables .",
    "the concrete form can be obtained by substituting all the observables in eq .",
    "( [ theo2 ] ) and letting @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "in addition , one knows that the direct application of the uncertainty relations with two observables ( in fact , we can also use the uncertainty relations with three observables , or other forms .",
    "how to group the observables could be complicated .",
    "the fundamental idea can also be found in our previous paper @xcite ) can also induce the uncertainty with more observables . in our examples",
    ", this means that one should randomly select two observables from the set of @xmath92 .",
    "here we only consider three of them for simplicity , that is , @xmath93based on theorem 1 , we can immediately obtain the uncertainty relation for each pair of observables as @xmath94 .",
    "therefore , for each combination given by the @xmath95th line of eq .",
    "( zuhe ) , one always has an uncertainty relation with four observables as @xmath96 .",

    "@xcite , the lower bound ( pb ) is given by @xmath99    in fig .",
    "2 , we plot all the mentioned bounds and the sum of the variances . for our upper bound ( ub ) and lower bound ( lb ) , we use @xmath95 from @xmath100 to @xmath101 to order the different combinations of the observables @xmath102 .",
    "we set all @xmath103 , and randomly generate @xmath82 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 which are given in the current case by @xmath106 in order to obtain two lower bounds given in eq .",
    "( [ twob ] ) , we also consider two cases . for simplicity , in the first case",
    ", we let all @xmath107 , @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 and one can obtain one lower bound . in the second case",
    ", we let all @xmath107 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 and one can obtain the other lower bound .",
    "the larger lower bound serves as the final lower bound . with this choice of the parameters",
    ", we use tbm to denote the lower bound by the maximization in eq .",
    "( [ twob ] ) and use tb1 to denote the lower bound by the average in eq .",
    "( [ twob ] ) .    from fig .",
    "2 , one can find that the lower bound ( fb ) given in ref .",
    "srfei is strictly larger than the bound ( pb ) presented in ref .",
    ". however , our lower bound ( lb ) given in theorem 2 is much larger than both bounds ( fb and pb ) and quite close to @xmath114 ( sov ) .",
    "it is interesting that the lower bound by two - to - two combination ( tb1 ) is not always larger than fb , but the tbm with the same parameters in our examples is strictly larger than fb .",
    "in addition , one can also see that the lower bound tbm can sometimes go beyond the lower bound ( lb ) given in theorem 2 . in this sense , it is difficult to roughly tell which method can provide a better lower bound .",
    "so in general case , one has to consider different methods and finally select the maximal lower bound as the final result .",
    "however , in this paper , one will find that our method to constructing the bounds is powerful .",
    "it will provide arbitrarily tight bounds . to see this , we change the free parameters for the lower bound tb1 and now only set all @xmath115 , @xmath116 and keep all other parameters unchanged . with these changed parameters",
    ", we use tb2 to represent this lower bound .",
    "it is obvious that the lower bound tb2 is the maximal one among all presented lower bounds .",
    "this just shows that the lower bound given by our method is arbitrarily tight .",
    "one should note that tb2 is larger than tbm because they have different free parameters .",
    "once all the parameters are the same , tbm is always larger than tb2 .",
    "this means that tbm can be also adjusted as close to sov as possible .",
    "of course , if we properly adjust the parameters , one can also let the lower bound lb given in theorem 2 close enough to sov . thus one sees that by applying our method , any one of the lower bounds with free parameters can serve as an arbitrarily tight bound so long as the free parameters are properly adjusted . finally , in fig .",
    "2 we also plot the upper bound ( ub ) given in theorem 2 as a demonstration of its tightness . similarly , it can also be close enough to the sov by adjusting the parameters .",
    "before the end , we would like to emphasize that our method can be similarly used to construct the uncertainty relation for mixed states .",
    "it can be shown that the uncertainty relations for mixed states will have the same form as those for pure states .",
    "this can be done by replacing all the quantum states by the square roots of the corresponding density matrix .",
    "for example , in eq .",
    "( [ s1 ] ) , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "all the other states are similarly replaced .",
    "following the same procedures as theorem 1 and theorem 2 , one will arrive at the uncertainty relations with the same forms as eq .",
    "( [ main ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ theo2 ] ) . for pure states ,",
    "if our method is understood based on the superposition principle of quantum states . for mixed states , one can understood as that any a matrix can be expanded by the ` matrix basis ' .    for the uncertainty relations with multiple observables ,",
    "we have claimed that there is no unique way to constructing the bounds . in theorem 2 , we only give an alternative approach for the bounds .",
    "besides the approach is relatively simple , the most important advantage is that the lower bound is always non - negative .",
    "one can also try other methods , for example , in eq .",
    "( [ psi ] ) we can construct @xmath119 .",
    "correspondingly , one will also get the bounds . but this method looks complex and especially it could lead to the negative lower bound .",
    "of course , due to the arbitrary tightness , one can also adjust the parameters such that the negative lower bound is avoided . in one word , no matter",
    "what form of the bounds one can construct , one will always obtain arbitrarily tight bounds so long as the essence of our method is employed .    to sum up , we have applied the superposition principle of quantum states to present the arbitrarily tight lower and upper bounds for the uncertainty relation .",
    "it is shown that the bounds include free and controllable parameters so that they can be as tight as one expected . as a result ,",
    "our lower bound only vanishes when the measured state is the common eigenstate of all the considered observables .",
    "in addition , due to the arbitrary tightness , our method can greatly simplify the construction of bounds of uncertainty relation with multiple observables .",
    "that is , any one of the bound can always serve as a tight and nontrivial bound .",
    "thus it seems that the uncertainty relations with multiple observables are not necessary , because it will be naturally covered by the uncertainty relation with only two observables .",
    "we also intuitively illustrate the arbitrary tightness of our bounds by two examples separately for the uncertainty relations with two and four observables . finally , we would like to say that many relevant and interesting questions deserve us forthcoming efforts .",
    "our bounds have many distinguished advantages , however , the cost is the introduction of many parameters .",
    "therefore , what is the minimum number of the parameters for this kind of uncertainty relation with all our advantages ?",
    "in addition , can our current technique be used to the other forms of uncertainty relations ( principles ) including entropic uncertainty , noise - disturbance uncertainty ?",
    "how can we consider the uncertainty relation with memory in the same manner ?",
    "* lower bound of eq .",
    "( [ patis ] ) in qubit system.- * at first , we would like to emphasize that the nontrivial bound does nt only mean that a vanishing bound is given once the sum of the variances does nt vanish .",
    "it will also be trivial if the lower bound is equal to the sum of variance , because in this case we does nt need to look for _ bound_. of course , this should be distinguished from the case when the state happens to be the eigenstate of one observable . with this in mind",
    ", let s study @xmath120 and @xmath121 in eq .",
