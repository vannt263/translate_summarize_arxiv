    "comparisons between the cmb dipole and the local group ( lg ) gravitational acceleration can serve not only as a test for the kinematic origin of the former but also as a constraint on cosmological parameters . a commonly applied method of constraining the parameters by the lg velocity  gravity comparison is a maximum - likelihood analysis ( strauss et al .",
    "1992 , hereafter s92 ) .",
    "in such an analysis , a proper object describing nonlinear effects is the _ coherence function _ ( cf ) , @xmath1 where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the fourier components of the gravity and velocity fields , and",
    "@xmath4 means the ensemble averaging .",
    "we model cold dark matter as a pressureless fluid . we chose to use a grid - based code rather than a @xmath5-body code because it directly produces a volume - weighted velocity field , as required here .",
    "we checked that the cf depends on @xmath6 very weakly .",
    "next , we tested its dependence on the normalization of the power spectrum .",
    "we found that the dependence of the function on @xmath0 and the wavevector can be well modelled as @xmath7 where @xmath8 in the left panel of figure  1 we show the cf for the values of @xmath0 given by the cluster normalization , for flat models with @xmath9 and @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "dotted lines show the function from numerical simulations , while solid ones are our fits .",
    "the fits are good ; we checked that for other values of @xmath0 they are as good as those shown here .",
    "the cf has been modelled by s92 , who calibrated it so as to fit the results of n - body simulations of a standard cdm cosmology . in the right panel of figure  1",
    "we show s92 s prediction for the function , as well as our results , for the standard cdm power spectrum and @xmath0 normalization of s92 ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "the discrepancy of our results with the formula of s92 is drastic ! instead of a characteristic decoherence scale of @xmath12 @xmath13 ( s92 ) , our formula suggests a fraction of a megaparsec .",
    "greater coherence of the lg velocity with the lg gravity implies tighter constraints on cosmological parameters that can be obtained from their comparison .",
    "thus , _ in likelihood analyses of the lg acceleration , the value of @xmath14 can be determined with significantly greater precision than is currently believed_."
