    "although fluxoid quantization in superconductors was first demonstrated experimentally over 40 years ago,@xcite there has recently been a resurgence of interest in fluxoid dynamics in a ring geometry . for example",
    ", it has been proposed that the interacting dipole moments in an array of superconducting rings can provide a model experimental system for studying magnetism in ising antiferromagnets .",
    "@xcite this possibility has become particularly attractive with the development of @xmath2-rings : superconducting rings with an intrinsic quantum mechanical phase change of @xmath2 upon circling the ring , in the absence of supercurrents or externally applied fields .",
    "such @xmath2 phase changes can be produced either by the momentum dependence of an unconventional superconducting order parameter , @xcite or by magnetic interactions in the tunneling region of a josephson weak link in the ring.@xcite @xmath2-rings are an ideal model system for the ising antiferromagnet , since they have a degenerate , time - reversed ground state in the absence of an externally applied magnetic field .",
    "recent progress @xcite has made it possible to reliably make very large closely packed arrays of @xmath2-rings , which show strong antiferromagnetic correlations in their  spin \" orientations upon cooling in zero magnetic field.@xcite superconducting ring experiments have also been proposed@xcite and performed @xcite to test for the presence of  visons \" , vortex - like topological excitations which may result from electron fractionalization in the high - t@xmath3 cuprate superconductors .",
    "in addition , superconducting rings can provide a model system for the early evolution of the universe , through the study of quenched fluctuations in superconducting rings .",
    "@xcite each of these studies depend critically on an understanding of the fluxoid dynamics during the cooldown process .",
    "finally , there has been a resurgence of interest lately in macroscopic quantum coherence effects in superconducting rings , in conjunction with applications to quantum computation.@xcite in these experiments noise due to thermally activated motion of fluxoids must be considered , at least at elevated temperatures .",
    "therefore the study of fluxoid dynamics in rings is one of much current topical interest .",
    "thermally activated vortex dynamics in superconductors have been studied extensively,@xcite including in ring geometries.@xcite magnetic noise in high temperature cuprate superconductors has been shown to arise from thermally activated hopping of vortices between pinning sites.@xcite fluxoid dynamics have been studied in superconducting rings interrupted by josephson weak links,@xcite and in mesoscopic rings , with the coherence length comparable to the ring dimensions.@xcite however , the system we have chosen to study , relatively large rings with long magnetic penetration depths ( because they are strongly underdoped ) , is in many respects a particularly simple one .",
    "first , our rings have no intentional josephson weak links . many quantitative details specific to phenomena related to flux quantization can be treated within the london approach , which is not bound by the rigid temperature restriction of the ginzburg - landau theory . the smallness of the ring with respect to the pearl length @xcite @xmath4 ( in the thin film limit , the london penetration depth @xmath5 , the film thickness ) simplifies considerably the problem of a ring in an applied magnetic field",

    "as discussed above , we have also implicitly assumed that the rings are spatially homogeneous , with a sharp superconducting transition temperature .",
    "the resistive transitions are in fact quite broad .",
    "this broadening could be a source of the apparently reduced temperature dependence of @xmath82 and reduced vortex nucleation energy that we observe .",
    "finally , spatial inhomogeneities could reduce the effective width of the rings .    in summary",
    "then , we have measured single fluxoid transitions and two - state telegraph noise in superconducting thin film rings as a function of applied magnetic field and temperature at temperatures close to t@xmath3 . the long penetration depths in the underdoped cuprate films used allowed measurements over a relatively broad temperature range .",
    "the measurements are generally consistent with a model in which the fluxoid transitions are mediated by thermally activated nucleation of a bulk vortex in , and transport of the vortex across , the ring wall .",
    "we presented a model which qualitatively explains some of the features of the data , but other features remain puzzling .",
