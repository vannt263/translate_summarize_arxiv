    "<S> the fact that such a violation of the distance duality relation can account for a dimming of the supernovae luminosity  @xcite , since e.g. in the case of photon - axion mixing the luminosity distance has to be rescaled as @xmath14 with @xmath15 being the probability for a photon to oscillate in an axion after having propagated over a distance @xmath16 , has motivated the design of many tests of this relation  @xcite using independent measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath2  @xcite based on the sz effect and x - ray measurements  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> are coupled to the electrons and baryons by thomson scattering up to recombination [ 1 , 2 ] ( see @xcite for a description of the physical origins of the different spectral distortions ) . </S>",

    "<S> deviations from the planck spectrum induced by non - linear dynamics  @xcite are negligible as recalled in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 7 ) ; see also @xcite .    then , denoting the emission temperature by @xmath57 , we have that @xmath58 = \\nu^3(1+z)^3 f\\left[\\frac{\\nu(1+z)}{t_e}\\right].\\ ] ] using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ int55 ] ) and the relation @xmath59 , which follows from the definition of redshift ( which is purely a time dilation effect , so this relation is quite independent of area distances ) , we finally get @xmath60\\ ] ] after simplifying by a factor @xmath61 .    </S>",
    "<S> as long as @xmath62 , the redshift prefactor combines with the factor @xmath63 in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> however there is no spectral distortion , so such an achromatic effect can be confused with calibration errors .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the grey body factor does not impact wien s displacement law , that the wavelength @xmath68 at which the intensity of the radiation is maximum obeys @xmath69 where wien s displacement constant is @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a frequency @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> the stefan - boltzmann law states that the power emitted per unit area of the surface of a black body is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature ; @xmath72 , where @xmath73 is the total power radiated per unit area and @xmath74 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . for a grey body , this is modified to @xmath75 because all intensities get changed by this same factor . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the wien temperature @xmath76 and the stefan - boltzmann temperature @xmath77 are different iff @xmath78 the first is independent of @xmath4 , the second is not . </S>",
    "<S> + in summary , a violation of the distance duality relation  ( [ e.ddr ] ) has an imprint on the cmb spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> two possible origins of such a violation are a violation of the reciprocity relation , or non - conservation of the number of photons .    </S>",
    "<S> generically , the evolution of the distribution function @xmath79 of the cmb is discussed in terms of the boltzmann equation , @xmath80=c[f]$ ] . in a friedmann - lematre universe , </S>",
    "<S> the distribution function is , by symmetry , a function of the energy @xmath81 and cosmic time @xmath82 so that the liouville term reduces to @xmath80=e\\partial_t f -he^2\\partial_ef$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> if the collision term does not depend on energy , the integration of the boltzmann equation over energy gives the following evolution equation for the photon number density ( see e.g. ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) @xmath83 in general , the collision term depends on energy , as for example in the case of axion - photon mixing , so the effect of photon non - conservation is expected to be chromatic . </S>",

    "<S> only the solid black curve corresponds to realistic parameters . ]    </S>",
    "<S> concerning the possibility of a violation of the reciprocity relation , the cobe - firas experiment  @xcite showed that the cmb photons have a black body spectrum within @xmath89 over the frequency range from 2 to 20 @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> more important concerning our work , it showed that the deviations are less than @xmath91 of the peak brightness with an rms value of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this means that the normalisation of the spectrum can be considered accurate at this level so that it indicates a constraint of the order @xmath92 with @xmath93 for the redshift of the last scattering surface . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite for an example of the case of photon - axion mixing . to compare to previous constraints  @xcite , we use the fact that they were based on bolometric observations so that they concerned the parameter @xmath105 defined in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> note that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lim ] ) gives much tighter limits over a much longer range of redshifts .    for completeness , we shall also mention that bounds have been set on the relation between cmb temperature and redshift , assuming a form @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> the index @xmath108 may be constrained through measurements of the sunyaev - zeldovich effect for redshifts @xmath109 and fine structure excitations in quasar spectroscopy for redshifts @xmath110 , specifically @xmath111 up to a redshift of @xmath112 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a non - vanishing @xmath108 has been argued to appear in models with decaying dark energy  @xcite , but it has been argued to have an unphysical ansatz @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such constraints on the temperature are not easily related to ours since these analyses assume a planck spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> however , when the spectrum is no longer a planck spectrum the different notions of temperatures differ . we have already noted the difference between the wien and stefan - boltzmann temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is also related to the bolometric temperature in the case of spectral distortions . </S>",
    "<S> note also that while the brightness and the bolometric temperatures agree at the background and first order level , it has been shown  @xcite that the non - linear dynamics sources a @xmath33-type spectral distortion and this would affect the brightness and thus both the brightness and the bolometric temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> in such a case  @xcite it was proposed to use occupation number temperature defined as the temperature of a black body which would have the same number density of photons as the actual distribution ( to be contrasted with the bolometric temperature which is the temperature of the black body which carries the same energy density as the actual distribution ) . + * conclusion * : we have shown that cmb spectral observations allow one to test the distance duality relation . </S>",
    "<S> we have emphasized the difference between the imprint induced by the non - conservation of photons , usually chromatic , and a violation of the reciprocity relation , which is achromatic . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that the cmb spectrum is a grey spectrum , with the same shape as the cmb power spectrum , up to a normalisation factor . </S>",
    "<S> the firas / cobe data allowed us to set constraints of the order of @xmath113 on the relative deviation from the reciprocity relation for the cmb .    </S>",
    "<S> as a final remark , we note that the limits above are for radiation coming from the surface of last scattering at @xmath114 . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is likely that any effect violating the ddr relation would be cumulative , and hence proportional to distance . while it probably implies stronger constraints for closer sources , no robust and model - independent bound can be derived . </S>",
    "<S> note however that our constraint improves those at low redshift by at least two orders of magnitude . </S>"
