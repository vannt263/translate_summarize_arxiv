    "the former persists at zero temperature , since it reflects the granularity in charge transmission manifested by partitioning , while the latter vanishes at @xmath16 , because its origin is the thermal fluctuations of the occupation numbers in the reservoirs . indeed , at equilibrium the sum of two opposite shot - noise terms [ eq .",

    "@xcite    it should be stressed that both eqs .",
    "( [ stwo ] ) and ( [ stwo1 ] ) are not complete , since they ignore coulomb interactions .",

    "@xcite an interesting question is how the self - consistency may affect the current and noise formulas ( [ mcur1])([stwo1 ] ) ?",

    "@xmath20 is a complicated problem in general , since they are self - consistently linked to the fluctuations of the occupation numbers along the conductor .",
    "( the latter may be expressed through the fluctuations of the occupation numbers at the terminals , since the system is ballistic @xcite ) . as a result of this self - consistent coupling ,",
    "the long - range coulomb correlations appear , which may result in the noise suppression .",
    "@xcite it is believed , however , that such coulomb correlations need to be taken into account for the description of systems in time - dependent external fields , or finite - frequency fluctuation spectra in stationary fields , while the zero - frequency fluctuations in stationary fields are not affected by them .",
    "@xcite we show that this is not always true . in the example",
    "we address in this paper , the additional terms induced by the self - consistent field are of the order of the fluctuations injected from the leads and can not be neglected even in the zero - frequency limit at time - independent biases .",
    "moreover , _ they can almost completely compensate the injected fluctuations up to an arbitrarily small value_. at the same time , the gauge invariance required for the charge conservation is fulfilled .",
    "we also found that this coulomb suppression of noise is manifested in the negative excess voltage noise .",
    "current or voltage fluctuations in equilibrium , described by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , usually increase when an external electric field is applied .",
    "we have an interesting example when an interacting ( via coulomb forces ) electron system is less noisy at far - from - equilibrium conditions than in equilibrium . for noninteracting systems ,",
    "such examples have been given by lesovik and loosen .",
    "@xcite    to support our statement we present a theory of current and voltage fluctuations in a ballistic two - terminal conductor in a self - consistent field .",
    "( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the calculation of the self - consistent fluctuating field is , in general , a multidimensional problem which includes the electrostatic environment . for simplicity",
    ", we consider rather thick samples that allow us to use one - dimensional plane geometry for electrostatics . on the other hand , for wide conductors",
    "the number of transversal modes is large and the semiclassical treatment is sufficient . by assuming that there is no current partitioning ( @xmath3=1 for all the transmitting modes )",
    ", we focus mainly on the nonequilibrium noise caused by thermal emission from the reservoirs under the action of the long - range coulomb correlations inside the ballistic region , rather than on the partition shot noise .",
    "it should be noted that the previous theoretical studies have been devoted to ballistic conductors with a small number of quantum modes ( quantum point contacts ) with the fermi suppression of the partition shot noise ( coulomb correlations have been ignored ) .",
    "@xcite    the main results of the present investigation are as follows : we have obtained complete analytical expressions for the steady - state spatial profiles ( carrier density , self - consistent field ) , mean current , and differential conductance , as well as the current and voltage noise powers in ballistic multimode conductors .",
    "the analytical results have been obtained for a wide range of biases : from equilibrium to high values beyond the linear - response regime under the self - consistent - field conditions .",
    "we assume in our derivations arbitrary distribution functions and correlation properties of injected electrons in order to generalize the model to the practically important cases of nanoscale devices with nonequilibrium electron injection , like in a resonant - tunneling - diode emitter , superlattice emitter , hot - electron emitter , etc.(see , e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "the particular case of a three - dimensional ( 3d ) fermi - dirac injection has also been addressed .",
    "the obtained results clearly demonstrate that both the current and voltage noise can be substantially reduced owing to the long - range coulomb interactions .",
    "this result is very encouraging from the point of view of applications .",

    "we consider a semiconductor ballistic sample attached to plane - parallel leads ( fig .  [ f1 ] ) . in a semiclassical framework ,",
    "the electron occupation numbers @xmath21 inside the ballistic conductor are determined by the electron flows from the left and right leads .",
    "the distribution of carriers is nonhomogeneous along the conductor : their concentration is higher near the leads and lower in the middle of the sample .",
    "the inhomogeneity of the space charge disturbs the electrostatic potential in such a way that the self - consistent built - in field determines the potential barrier , at which electrons are either reflected or transmitted depending on their energy ( fig .",
    "we neglect tunneling and quantum reflection , i.e. , the transmission probability is 1 if the electron energy is higher than the barrier height , and it is 0 in the opposite case . out of equilibrium ,",
    "the barrier height is different for the left and right lead electrons . if for the left electrons the barrier height is @xmath22 , for the right electrons the barrier height is @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "this leads to an asymmetry in their contribution to the current : as the bias is increased , the barrier for the left electrons progressively decreases and the current from the left lead enhances , whereas the barrier for the right electrons increases and the current from the right lead decreases disappearing at all at high biases .",
    "the occupation numbers are described by the vlasov equation ( collisionless boltzmann equation with a self - consistent field ) @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the electron effective mass , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is the self - consistent electric potential determined by the poisson equation @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the dielectric permittivity and @xmath30 is the dimension of a momentum space ( the spin variable is neglected ) .",
    "since carriers move without collisions , the only source of noise arises from the random injection of carriers from the leads .",
    "thus the boundary conditions at the left ( l ) and right ( r ) leads are : @xmath31 where @xmath32 are the stochastic forces inside the leads with zero average and given correlation properties , and @xmath33 is the applied bias between @xmath34=0 and @xmath34=@xmath35 ( the potential drop inside the leads is neglected ) . as a consequence of stochastic injection , the occupation numbers @xmath36 and hence the potential @xmath37 fluctuate in time around their time - averaged values .",
    "the leads are assumed to be completely absorptive , and the transverse electron momenta are conserved .",
    "thus , one can make summing up over the transversal states ( the summation can be replaced by integration due to the assumption of a large number of modes ) and introduce for each longitudinal energy @xmath38 the ( fluctuating ) occupation factor at a cross section @xmath34 : @xmath39 where @xmath38=@xmath40 , @xmath41= @xmath42 , and @xmath43 is the density of transverse modes ( @xmath44 for the 3d case ) .",

    "applied here for a thick conductor , the number of the occupied transversal modes is assumed to be large , @xmath47 .",

    "therefore , at the barrier position @xmath34=@xmath52 , we obtain @xmath48=0 for electrons having the injection kinetic energy equal to the barrier height ( for both leads ) .",
