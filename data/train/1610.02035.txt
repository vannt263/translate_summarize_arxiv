    "the anderson localization in real space of a particle in a disordered medium  @xcite is theoretically well understood  @xcite and experimentally confirmed in various settings  @xcite . in systems with many interacting particles , despite the consensus that many - body localization should still take place in the limit of strong disorder , the details of the metal - insulator transition are richer than in noninteracting systems .",
    "the seeds for the analysis of many - body localization were sown in the 80 s @xcite and 90 s @xcite .",
    "the general expectation was that interaction might hamper localization , but not completely prevent it .",
    "the study of two interacting particles in a one - dimensional ( 1d ) disordered chain , for instance , showed that the localization length was larger than in a one - particle system  @xcite .",
    "a number of theoretical studies followed in the 2000 s @xcite , but the current decade has witnessed a burst of interest in the subject , with not only theoretical  @xcite , but also experimental works  @xcite .    among the several questions that have been raised , the existence or not of an intermediate phase between the chaotic and the many - body localized phase  @xcite is the one that mainly motivates the present work .",
    "our numerical results for a finite 1d spin-1/2 system with nearest - neighbor interaction and onsite random magnetic fields suggest a positive answer .",
    "as the strength of the disorder increases from zero , where the system is integrable , the following regions are covered , before localization is finally reached : ( i ) transition from the integrable to the chaotic domain , ( ii ) chaotic regime , and ( iii ) intermediate region between the chaotic limit and the many - body localized phase .",
    "chaotic states prevail in the chaotic domain , while in the intermediate region before localization , the eigenstates are delocalized ( extended ) in the configuration space but nonchaotic ( nonergodic ) .",
    "our definition of a chaotic state is as follows .",
    "given an eigenstate @xmath0 , the inverse participation ratio @xmath1 measures how much delocalized the eigenstate is in the basis vectors @xmath2 , with @xmath3 being the dimension of the hamiltonian matrix . in studies of spatial localization ,",
    "the focus is on the basis that represents the configuration space .",
    "the eigenstate is chaotic if it samples most of the hilbert space without any preference , which gives @xmath4 .",
    "the paradigmatic example of chaotic states are the eigenstates of full random matrices ( frm ) , which are ( pseudo-)random vectors . when these matrices are the real and symmetric ones from gaussian orthogonal ensembles ( goe ) @xcite , the components of their eigenstates are real random numbers from a gaussian distribution satisfying the normalization condition , so @xmath5 @xcite . in realistic finite systems with two - body interactions ,",
    "it is away from the edges of the spectrum that we expect to find very delocalized eigenstates with @xmath4 , but even there minor correlations may persist",

    "we do not aim at locating exactly the point that separates one region from the other , but discuss the best quantities to identify and characterize each one .",
    "our focus is on regions ( ii ) and ( iii ) .",
    "our study of the statistic properties involves level statistics , structure of the eigenstates and statistics of the initial states .",
    "they are used for comparisons with our results for the dynamics .",

    "we analyze the spectrum using nearest - neighbor level spacing distributions and level number variance .",

    "the distribution of the components of the initial state written in the energy eigenbasis are contrasted with the porter - thomas distribution  @xcite . in regions ( i ) and ( iii ) , the level statistics is intermediate  @xcite between that of uncorrelated and repelling eigenvalues .",
    "the results indicate that region ( i ) may disappear in the thermodynamic limit . in region ( iii ) , the eigenstates are nonchaotic but delocalized , and there is no agreement with the porter - thomas distribution .    for the dynamics",
    ", we investigate the time evolution of both entropies and of the survival probability .",
    "the latter is defined as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the initial state , @xmath12 is the hamiltonian describing the system , and @xmath13 .",
    "the decay of the survival probability at long times is necessarily powerlaw , @xmath14 , even in the chaotic regime  @xcite .",
    "the value of the powerlaw exponent @xmath15 is very sensitive to the properties of both the initial state and the hamiltonian . in region ( ii ) , where there is level repulsion and the eigenstates are chaotic , @xmath16 . in region ( iii ) ,",

    "the advantage of the shannon entropy is to be computationally less expensive than the entanglement entropy , because contrary to the latter , it does not require performing a partial trace over degrees of freedom .    the main characteristics of regions ( i ) , ( ii ) , and ( iii ) are summarized in fig .",

    "the maximum powerlaw exponent @xmath169 is reached in the limit of full random matrices when @xmath170 @xcite .",
    "banded random matrices provide a general picture of the available powerlaw exponents for the quench dynamics of isolated many - body quantum systems without the restriction of a particular model .",
    "this emphasizes that the results presented here are general and not specific to the spin-1/2 model considered .",
    "in contrast to the survival probability , the entropy growth in time does not provide any clear signature of the khalfin effect for the system sizes examined here .",

    "the survival probability is more sensitive to changes in the spectrum and in the structures of the eigenstates than the entropies .      the results above show that details about the hamiltonian and the initial state can be extracted from the dynamics .",
    "this is very useful for experiments that routinely study dynamics .",
    "the evolution of the survival probability , in particular , offers direct information about level statistics .",
    "the presence of level repulsion can be inferred from the difference between the minimum value of the survival probability , @xmath171 , and its infinite time average , @xmath172 .",
    "this difference is known as correlation hole  @xcite .",
    "it does not exist in systems with uncorrelated eigenvalues , while in frm the hole is very deep .",
    "the notion of correlation hole was first introduced as a method to obtain information about level statistics from systems where one has only partial access to the spectrum  @xcite .    in figs .",

    "from the analysis of static and dynamical properties of a finite one - dimensional spin-1/2 system with onsite random disorder , we identified three regions between the integrable domain , where the disorder strength @xmath20 is zero , and the many - body localized phase .",
    "they are : ( i ) the transition region between the integrable and the chaotic domain , ( ii ) the chaotic region , and ( iii ) the intermediate region between chaos and localization .",

    "the survival probability , in particular , reveals details that the shannon information entropy and the von neumann entanglement entropy can not capture .",
    "these include the correlation hole , which is a way to directly detect level repulsion from dynamics , and the khalfin effect caused by the unavoidable energy bounds of the spectrum .",
    "we also showed that the results for both entropies are comparable , thus either one can be used for the studies of many - body localization .",
    "the calculation of the shannon entropy is more straightforward , because it does not involve any partial trace .",

    "the correlation hole is deep and close to the limits established by random matrix theory .",
    "the linear growth of the shannon entropy and of the von neumann entanglement entropy is followed by saturation .",
    "this is the region where thermalization is expected .",
    "@xmath187 region ( iii ) has intermediate level statistics .",

    "fractal dimensions smaller than 1 indicate that the states are fractal and therefore nonergodic .",
    "this lack of ergodicity is reflected into the dynamics .",
    "the powerlaw exponent of the long - time decay of @xmath124 is small and agrees with the fractal dimension , @xmath194 .",
    "the linear increase in time of the entropies is followed by a logarithmic growth before saturation .",
