    "scoring procedures transform profiles of individual preferences over a set of alternatives into scores of the alternatives .",
    "the scores can be used in themselves or serve as the basis for ranking or choice . for the present ,",
    "only a few scoring procedures are endowed with their axiomatic characterizations . at the same time , a large number of ingenious procedures are advocated and used in such disciplines as management science , operations research , psychometrics , applied statistics , processing of sport tournaments , graph theory , etc .",
    "very few social choice papers deal with them .",
    "the aim of this paper is to take one circumspect step toward an axiomatic framework for comparing the merits of these elaborate procedures . as a result",
    ", we would like to isolate a family of scoring procedures that comprises a majority of ` reasonable ' procedures ( so that the further axioms could be imposed on this family ) . two main approaches are applicable .",
    "the first one is to express the desired properties axiomatically , the second is to gather the existing procedures and specify their common algebraic form .",
    "we use both , and their results are concordant : a scoring procedure satisfies the axiom of _ self - consistency _ if and only if it has a _ monotone implicit form_.    to circumscribe the variety of axioms that have already been used in the literature ( and which can be adapted for the family of procedures isolated here ) , we survey a number of characterizations of scoring methods .    the paper is organized as follows . after the main notation ( section  [ nota ] )",
    ", we give a review of some papers that characterize scoring methods for preference aggregation ( section  [ revi ] ) , introduce the notions of self - consistency ( section  [ self ] ) and monotone implicit form ( section  [ mif ] ) , and prove our theorem ( section  [ theo ] ) .",
    "let @xmath2 be a profile of individual preferences over the set of alternatives @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is the number of individuals and @xmath5 represents the preferences of the @xmath6th individual . in classical papers , @xmath7 are linear orders . here",
    "we would like to involve several other settings as well , where equivalencies are allowed or transitivity is not assumed or even degrees of preference are reported .",
    "namely , @xmath8 is a completely defined matrix of paired comparisons , where for @xmath9 , @xmath10 $ ] , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( although @xmath12 are not used in the paper ) .",
    "when only strict preferences are allowed , @xmath13 , otherwise @xmath14 means equivalence ; in some settings @xmath10 $ ] is interpreted as the part of a unit preference or probability that is assigned to @xmath0 in comparison with @xmath1 ( in turn @xmath15 is assigned to @xmath1 ) .",
    "transitivity may or may not be assumed .",
    "the constraint @xmath11 may seem to be unduly restrictive , but we believe it is not . in this",
    "setting , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are not independent comparison outcomes , but rather two complementary evaluations of the same outcome .",
    "that is why their relation merely characterizes the method of evaluation .",
    "monotone transformations take them to other popular types of data , e.g. , exponential transformations @xmath18 give @xmath19 , which is typical of the analytical hierarchy framework . yet , as was noticed by an anonymous referee , the theorem in section  [ theo ] is adaptable for the case with mutually independent @xmath16 and @xmath17 too .",
    "letting some restrictions on @xmath7 ( or on @xmath20 as a whole ) be imposed , suppose @xmath21 is the set of all admissible preference profiles with given @xmath22 ( the number of alternatives ) and @xmath4 ( the number of individuals ) . in sections",
    "[ self][theo ] , @xmath22 and @xmath4 are fixed .",
    "let @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 .",
    "a _ scoring operator _ or _ scoring procedure _ is a function @xmath26 where @xmath27 , @xmath28 being a _ score _ ( or weight , etc . ) assigned to alternative @xmath0 . `",
    "scores ' are often associated with total points , however , a number of papers consider scores as general weights as in this definition , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "let _ scoring methods _ be the generic term for scoring operators and procedures of ranking / choice based on them .    the review in the following section involves a number of results that deal with social utility ( welfare ) functions .",
    "there is no essential difference between them and the scores @xmath29 , however , we do not find it natural to give them a common designation .",
    "so , we hold @xmath29 for scores derived from paired comparisons and @xmath30 ( or @xmath31 @xmath32 ) for social utilities .",
    "individual utilities will be denoted by @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "some papers that characterize scoring methods are presented in table  [ tcha ] ( parts  1 to  6 ) .",
    "they are ordered chronologically ( up to years ) , and every column can be used to classify the results .",
    "characterizations of scoring procedures that have the form of product are not included , since their theory is entirely parallel to that of additive procedures ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we use six standard abbreviations : n for neutrality , a for anonymity , m for monotonicity , iia and niia for arrow s and nash s independences of irrelevant alternatives , and p for the strong pareto principle ( ` weak p ' designates the weak pareto principle ) .",
    "let us start with the third column .",
    "the scores of alternatives can be used in themselves , for ranking or choice .",
    "so the results are classified as ones characterizing :    * ranking procedures based on scores",
    ". they may provide : * * weak order @xcite . *",
    "* weak order over all admissible or feasible vectors of individual utilities / scores or on an extension of @xmath35 @xcite . * * partial order @xcite . * choice procedures based on scores",
    "( alternatives with the highest score are chosen ) .",
    "table  [ tcha ] contains procedures that provide : * * choice set @xcite . *",
    "* several variants of choice set with @xmath36 members @xcite .",
    "( it is interesting to compare debord s result with another approach to the committee selection advocated and characterized in @xcite and also based on the borda scores . ) * * choice from a set of admissible or feasible vectors of individual utilities / scores or from an extension of @xmath35 @xcite . * * choice function that attaches a nonempty choice set to every subset of @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "* procedures resulting in scores , measures of social welfare , utility , etc .",
    ", possibly on an extended set of alternatives @xcite .",

    "is conveyed by the following theorem .",
    "it is easily seen that each equation in table  [ tind ] has the form @xmath43 where @xmath44 strictly increases in @xmath16 ( recall that @xmath11 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , as assumed in section  [ nota ] ) and in @xmath47 and strictly decreases in @xmath28 .",
    "these properties of @xmath44 can be intuitively motivated as follows : the greater comparison outcomes @xmath16 and ` strengths of opponents ' @xmath47 alternative @xmath0 has , the greater should be its own ` strength ' @xmath28 ( to provide the zero sum on the left - hand side ) .",
    "a form close to ( [ impsi ] ) was used as an axiom to derive the generalized row sum method in @xcite .",
    "it can be noted however that this form is somewhat too special because of the double sum on the left - hand side .",
    "let us replace this sum with an arbitrary strictly increasing function .",
    "let @xmath48 be the set of all multisets that consist of @xmath49 real triples .",
    "a scoring procedure @xmath50 has a _ monotone implicit form _ if there exists a function @xmath51 such that + ( i ) for every profile @xmath52 , the scores satisfy the system of equations @xmath53 ( ii ) @xmath54 strictly increases in every @xmath16 and @xmath47 and strictly decreases in @xmath28 .",
    "this form is a direct generalization of ( [ impsi ] ) .",
    "a scoring procedure @xmath55 is self - consistent if and only if it has a monotone implicit form .",
    "[ th ]    the ` if ' part of the theorem is an easy consequence of the corresponding definitions ( see the proof ) .",
    "the converse statement is not so trivial . below it",
    "is reduced to the fact that every bounded function defined on any ` paretian subset ' of @xmath56 has a strictly monotonic extension to the @xmath56 ( lemma  [ lem ] ) .",
    "in fact , we need a special case of lemma  [ lem ] , but its general formulation has essentially the same proof and is worth mentioning by itself .    prior to proving theorem",
    "[ th ] , note that the extended borda scores ( [ ebs ] ) trivially satisfy self - consistency ( the proof is left to the reader ) . by theorem  [ th ] , this procedure must have a monotone implicit form . indeed , as shown in @xcite , a one - parametric family of such forms is provided by the generalized row sum method : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a positive parameter and @xmath59 .",
    "the least squares procedure by smith @xcite and gulliksen @xcite presented in table  [ tind ] provides another form which can be obtained from ( [ grsf ] ) as @xmath60 .",
    "suppose that @xmath0 in @xmath20 majorizes @xmath1 in @xmath62 .",
    "then there exists a one - to - one mapping @xmath63 from @xmath64 onto @xmath65 such that @xmath66 implies @xmath67 and @xmath68 assume that @xmath69 . then by ( ii ) the left - hand side of the @xmath0th equation of ( [ mife ] ) written for @xmath20 is greater than the left - hand side of the @xmath1th equation of ( [ mife ] ) written for @xmath62 and they can not be both equal to zero . hence @xmath70 and item 1 of self - consistency is satisfied",
    ". item 2 is proved similarly .        for every profile @xmath52 and every alternative @xmath0 , the multiset @xmath78 , where @xmath16 are the comparison outcomes of @xmath0 in @xmath20 and @xmath79 are the scores assigned by @xmath55 ,",
    "will be called the _ multiset of comparison triples of @xmath0 in @xmath20_.    let @xmath80 where @xmath81 be the set of all vectors @xmath82 such that the multiset @xmath83 is the multiset of comparison triples of some alternative in some profile @xmath52 .",
    "it follows from self - consistency that @xmath84 is a paretian subset .",
    "prove lemma  [ lem ] for the open hypercube , @xmath1 and @xmath36 in the proof of lemma  [ lem ] have nothing in common with the same variables that denote alternatives ] @xmath95 substituted for the euclidean space @xmath56 .",
    "after that the general case of @xmath56 will be reduced to this one .",
    "suppose @xmath106 is the unit vector of the @xmath0th axis of @xmath56 ; @xmath107 @xmath108 .",
    "suppose that @xmath109 are such that for any @xmath110 , @xmath111 holds ( recall that @xmath91 in lemma  [ lem ] is bounded ) .",
    "define several auxiliary functions on @xmath112 .",
    "@xmath113 @xmath114      now we prove that @xmath90 possesses the desired properties ( @xmath89 ) and ( @xmath92 ) .",
    "first , note that @xmath119 and @xmath120 , @xmath121 , and thus @xmath90 are well - defined by the definitions of @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "assume that @xmath141 then there exists @xmath142 such that @xmath143 and @xmath144 . according to the definition of @xmath122 , this is impossible , since if there exists @xmath145 such that @xmath146 , then @xmath147 and hence @xmath148 ; on the other hand , if @xmath149 , then @xmath150 and @xmath148 as well .",
    "hence @xmath139 . similarly , @xmath140 .",
    "it is easy to verify that all possible translations of the vector @xmath152 from one set to another as @xmath153 increases are specified by the following diagrams : @xmath154 at all these translations , @xmath155 does not decrease by definition .",
    "now let @xmath85 be any paretian subset of @xmath56 .",
    "to extend @xmath91 to @xmath56 , we first contract @xmath56 onto @xmath112 by the mapping @xmath156 where @xmath157 @xmath158 .",
    "then solve the problem on @xmath112 and finally extend @xmath112 onto @xmath56 by @xmath159 , i.e. , @xmath160 , @xmath158 .",
    "it is obvious that under these strictly increasing transformations , paretian subsets are mapped to paretian subsets and strictly increasing functions to strictly increasing functions .",
    "this completes the proof of lemma  [ lem ] .    to prove theorem  [ th ] , apply lemma  [ lem ] to @xmath161 .",
    "namely , put @xmath162 and @xmath163 then the conclusion of lemma  [ lem ] differs from the desired statement only by that the required function @xmath54 should be defined for the multisets of real triples and should map all _ multisets of comparison triples _ to zero , whereas function @xmath164 provided by lemma  [ lem ] is defined on @xmath165 and maps to zero all vectors corresponding to the multisets of comparison triples . but note that @xmath84 is invariant ( by definition ) to any permutation of triples of adjacent coordinates @xmath166 .",
    "then , by the proof of lemma  [ lem ] , in this case @xmath164 is also invariant to such permutations applied to its argument .",
    "this implies that the value of @xmath164 for any vector @xmath167 is solely determined by the _ multiset _ of adjacent triples of coordinates @xmath168 . in other words , @xmath164 does not depend on the order of these triples in @xmath169 .",
    "therefore , @xmath164 being considered as a function of such multisets of triples defines a function @xmath54 with the desired properties .",
