    "for many years the possibility of direct observation of the cosmic neutrino background ( c@xmath1b ) , namely of those neutrinos that are relics of the big bang , has been considered and its terrible difficulty stressed . we know that their average number density in the universe should be @xmath2 @xmath3 for neutrinos ( or antineutrinos ) of each flavour and that they decoupled at a temperature around 1 mev . since then",
    ", the universe expanded by about 10 orders of magnitude and therefore the average c@xmath1b momenta are today @xmath4  ev .    deviations of the spectrum in beta decays near to the end point due to a possible neutrino chemical potential in c@xmath1b were first suggested many years ago by weinberg @xcite , but present limits on the chemical potential from nucleosynthesis @xcite make this effect unobservable .",
    "it is the effect of the nonzero mass of the neutrino that could instead provide a hope , if its value is close to the present experimental bound .",
    "if this is the case , gravitational clustering could increase the number density @xmath5 by one or two orders of magnitude  @xcite .",
    "we recall that present limits are @xmath6  ev from tritium decay @xcite and @xmath7  ev from cosmology @xcite .",
    "it has been recently proposed @xcite to try to observe the process of capture of a neutrino in the c@xmath1b by a @xmath8decaying nucleus . in this case",
    "the electron in the final state has energy larger than the maximum energy of @xmath8rays by twice the value of the neutrino mass , and could therefore be distinguished , with a _ very _ good resolution , if the neutrino mass is large enough .",
    "an obvious candidate for the target is tritium , due to its small @xmath9value ( 18.6 kev ) and good sensitivity to neutrino mass effects .",
    "the detection of antineutrinos in c@xmath1b could analogously be made using as target radioactive atoms that decay by electron capture ( ec ) .",
    "this possibility has been examined in ref .",
    "@xcite , but apparently discarded as much less promising . in this letter , we want to deepen the examination in order to show that this is not correct , and that in fact the capture of antineutrinos in the c@xmath1b by nuclei of @xmath0ho ( the record element for low @xmath9value in ec decays ) could be a valid alternative .",
    "the energy spectrum of neutrinos produced in ec decays is given by a series of lines , each at an energy @xmath10 ( where @xmath9 is the mass difference of the two atoms in their ground states and @xmath11 is the binding energy of the electron hole in the final atom ) .",
    "the decay process that we consider is : @xmath12 the ec decay rate can be expressed , following @xcite , as a sum over the possible captured levels : @xmath13^{1/2 } \\ ; .\\ ] ] in this equation @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the fraction of occupancy of the i - th atomic shell , @xmath16 is the nuclear shape factor , @xmath17 is the coulomb amplitude of the electron radial wave function ( essentially , the modulus of the wave function at the origin ) and @xmath18 is an atomic correction for electron exchange and overlap .",
    "the spin and parity of the nuclei involved in reaction ( [ decay ] ) obey the relations @xmath19 , and the transition is dubbed as allowed .",
    "the @xmath9value for this reaction is so small that only electrons from levels @xmath20 can be captured . in a very good approximation the nuclear shape factors",
    "@xmath21 are all equal in an allowed transition , as it has been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and can be factored out from the sum in eq.([ecrate ] ) .",
    "different determinations of the @xmath9value can be found in the literature @xcite . in this letter",
    "we will use values ranging from an optimistic 2.3  kev to a pessimistic 2.8  kev .",
    "the low q - value of this transition prompted many years ago several proposals to use @xmath0ho decays to search for a signal of nonzero neutrino mass ( as opposed to the antineutrino mass measured in tritium decays ) .",
    "the neutrino mass in fact affects the capture rates from different levels @xcite , as in eq.([ecrate ] ) , and it modifies the spectra of inner brehmstrahlung photons @xcite and emitted electrons @xcite near to their endpoints .",
    "several experiments have been performed @xcite , obtaining upper bounds on the neutrino mass larger than 200 ev .",
    "these measurements were mainly limited by the poor knowledge of complicated atomic corrections that can modify the emitted x ",
    "rays spectrum .",
    "a more promising technique would be a calorimetric experiment , embedding the radioactive @xmath0ho source in a bolometer .",
    "this was suggested many years ago @xcite and it is presently being developed @xcite thanks to the huge improvements of the technique in terms of energy resolution .",
    "the advantage with respect to other techniques is that all the de  excitation energy is measured and does not remain partly trapped in invisible channels .",
    "the atomic levels have a finite ( albeit often small ) natural width , and therefore the lines have a breit  wigner resonance form , so that the spectrum of `` calorimetric '' energy @xmath22 should be given by    @xmath23    a calculated de  excitation energy spectrum is presented in fig.[fig : fig1 ] and the effect of a nonzero neutrino mass near to the end point is shown in fig.[fig : fig2 ] .",
    "ho with @xmath24  kev .",
    "detector resolution effects are not included .",
    "the parameters used in the calculation are discussed in section [ numbers].,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    ho with @xmath24  kev near to the end point for neutrino of zero mass ( solid black line ) or with @xmath25  ev ( dashed red line).,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    bolometers , however , have the disadvantage of being slow , and therefore pile  up could be a problem . the way to tame it is to use a large number of smallish detectors @xcite .",
    "consider now the capture by the original nucleus of a very low energy @xmath26 and an electron from the @xmath27th atomic shell : @xmath28 the procedure to evaluate the rate for this process has been presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , following the formalism for ec decays introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the number density of incoming antineutrinos , @xmath31 is their energy ( @xmath32 for c@xmath1b ) and @xmath33 is the density of final states .",
    "again , the nuclear shape factors can be factored out of the sum .    the final states in reaction ( [ reaction ] ) are unstable and the final value of the de  excitation energy must be @xmath34 for a zero energy incoming antineutrino .",
    "even if this value does not coincide with the maximum of the breit  wigner curve it can be reached anyhow , although of course the rate will be suppressed . as a consequence , the number of available final states per unit energy @xmath35 defined in ref .",
    "@xcite should be modified as follows : @xmath36 the ratio of the rates of the two processes considered is approximately : @xmath37    as we will show in the next section , for c@xmath1b antineutrinos this is a _ really _ small number .",
    "however , the ec events that can be a background are only those falling in a narrow energy interval before the end point , namely @xmath38 the fraction of ec events falling in this region is given by the so  called factor of merit : @xmath39 neglecting the variations of the different breit - wigner over the small scale @xmath40 and neglecting the neutrino mass with respect to @xmath10 , one has : @xmath41^{-1 } \\over \\sum_i n_i    \\beta_i^2 b_i\\ ; ( q - e_i)^2 } \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    as a consequence , the ratio of the counting rates of the antineutrino capture and the ec decays near to the end point is : @xmath42 the above expression of @xmath43 does not depend on @xmath9 and is equal to the analogous result for @xmath8 decay @xcite , showing that both types of radioactive decaying nuclei are in principle equally good as targets to detect c@xmath1b .",
    "we proceed to give numerical results , based on estimates found in the literature for the parameters appearing in the previous equations .",
    "the levels of the electrons that can be captured are fully occupied ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "their binding energies and widths are reported in table [ en - wid ] .",
    "note that the real values may slightly differ @xcite from these , obtained in dysprosium excitation , but they will be precisely determined in future calorimetric experiments , from widths and positions of the peaks in the measured @xmath22 distribution , see fig.([fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    ".energy levels of the captured electrons , with their widths , for @xmath0dy @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ waveratio ]    assuming for the unknown ( and not very relevant ) parameters the values @xmath45  ev for the levels ( o@xmath46 , o@xmath47 , p@xmath46 ) and @xmath48 for p@xmath46 , we find that the ratio of c@xmath1b antineutrino captures to the total ec events defined in eq.([ratio ] ) is : @xmath49 for @xmath50 , values higher than the analogous result for tritium @xmath8decays @xcite : @xmath51 .",
    "assuming as an example a value of 0.5  ev for the neutrino mass and @xmath52  ev , we have @xmath53 for @xmath50 , to be compared with the value @xmath54 for tritium .",
    "the half  lives are @xmath55  y for @xmath0ho ( @xmath56h ) .",
    "therefore we confirm that a calorimetric experiment with @xmath0ho , having a higher factor of merit , may be a competitor of @xmath56h for hunting the neutrino mass effect .",
    "for the detection of c@xmath1b the ratio of the counting rates of the antineutrino capture and the ec decays near to the end point , @xmath43 , is equal to the corresponding quantity for @xmath8decaying nuclei .",
    "we made an analysis including the effect of the detector resolution to determine the discovery potential of a future experiment using a @xmath0ho target .",
    "let us consider the total number of signal events : @xmath57 where @xmath58 is avogadro s number , @xmath59 the number of mols , @xmath60 the exposure time , @xmath61 the half  life of @xmath0ho and assume that we require a minimum number of 10 events observed . using the values in eq.([ratioval ] ) this correspond to a minimum quantity of @xmath0ho of ( 23.2 , 307 , 1274 )  kg@xmath62y for @xmath63  kev .",
    "the number of background events falling in an interval of amplitude @xmath64 centered at @xmath65 can be obtained by convoluting the energy distribution in ec events with a gaussian of variance @xmath66 .",
    "defining @xmath67 the number of background events is : @xmath68 defining the statistical significance as @xmath69 , in fig.[fig : fig3 ] we present the boundary of the discovery region , where the statistical significance is larger than 5 , in the plane ( @xmath70 , @xmath71 ) .",
    "the dependence on @xmath40 is so sharp that the variation with @xmath9 can not be appreciated given the thickness of the line .",
    "for @xmath72 , falls below the line.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    the boundary of the discovery region presented in fig.[fig : fig3 ] also applies to an experiment using a tritium target ( and looking for neutrinos in the c@xmath1b instead of antineutrinos ) . due to the different half  life and mass number , in this case to have a minimum of 10 signal events one needs 137  g@xmath62y of @xmath56h .",
    "at present , the requirements for both ec and @xmath8 decaying nuclei seem very demanding and we do not know which of the two very different technologies may have more chances . note that our estimates are pessimistic , since the inclusion of gravitational clustering effects would enhance the number of signal events .",
    "we have presented in this work an estimate of the requirements for an experiment aiming to detect antineutrinos in the c@xmath1b using a target of @xmath0ho .",
    "the request to have a reasonable number of events in the signal gives a constraint on the mass of the source and on the exposure time that is very sensitive to the @xmath9value , not yet well known .",
    "assuming @xmath24  kev one would need ten years of observation of a source of 30 kilograms to have 10 events of signal .",
    "even more stringent maybe are the sensitivity requirements , that instead are practically independent on @xmath9 : for a neutrino mass of 0.5  ev , for instance , one would need a resolution fwhm better than 0.33  ev in order to attain a statistical significance of 5 , the usual requirement for a discovery . nonetheless , maybe the neutrino mass is higher , the @xmath9value is smaller and the experimental ingenuity may arrive at resolutions better than the present ones .",
