    "an important research area of real algebraic geometry is concerned with representations of polynomials positive on a basic semi - algebraic set @xmath2 where @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath4 .",
    "an important result in this vein is schmdgen s positivstellensatz @xcite which states that if @xmath1 is compact and @xmath5 $ ] is positive on @xmath1 then @xmath6 belongs to the preordering @xmath7 generated by the @xmath8 s ; bounds on the degrees in the representation are even provided in schweighofer @xcite . under a rather weak additional assumption on the @xmath8 s , putinar s refinement @xcite states that @xmath6 even belongs to the quadratic module @xmath9 generated by the @xmath8 s .",
    "the above mentioned representation results do not specialize when @xmath6 is convex and the @xmath8 s are concave ( so that @xmath1 is convex ) a highly important case , particularly in optimization . also , as soon as @xmath1 is not compact any more then negative results , notably by scheiderer @xcite , exclude to represent _ any _ @xmath6 positive on @xmath1 as an element of @xmath7 or @xmath9 ( except perhaps in low - dimensional cases ) . for more details ,",
    "the interested reader is referred to the nice survey @xcite .",
    "however , inspired and motivated by some classical results from convex optimization , we show that specialized representation results are possible when @xmath6 is convex and the @xmath8 s are concave , in which case @xmath0 is a closed ( not necessarily compact ) convex basic semi - algebraic set .",
    "namely , a specific subset @xmath10 of the quadratic module @xmath9 is such that @xmath11 is _ dense _ ( for the @xmath12-norm of coefficients ) in the convex cone @xmath13 of convex polynomials , nonnegative on @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath14 $ ] be the ring of real polynomials in the variables @xmath15 , and let @xmath16 $ ] be the subset of sums of squares ( sos ) polynomials . if @xmath5 $ ] , write @xmath17 , and denote its @xmath12-norm by @xmath18 ) .",
    "if one is interested in representation of polynomials nonnegative on @xmath1 , the first polynomial to consider is of course @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "indeed , any other positive polynomial is just @xmath33 with @xmath34 .",
    "and so , if @xmath31 belongs to some preordering or some quadratic module , then so does @xmath6 . from proposition [ prop1 ]",
    "it is easy to establish the following result .",
    "[ coro1 ] let assumption [ ass1 ] hold and let @xmath5 $ ] be convex and such that @xmath24 for some @xmath25 .",
    "if the nonnegative polynomial @xmath35 of ( [ lagrangian ] ) is sos then @xmath36 for some convex sos polynomial @xmath37 and some nonnegative scalars @xmath38 , @xmath4 .",
    "that is , @xmath39 , with @xmath9 as in ( [ quad ] ) .",
    "in addition , the sos weights associated with the @xmath8 s are just nonnegative constants , and @xmath40 is convex .",
    "[ def1 ] a polynomial @xmath5 $ ] is sos - convex if its hessian @xmath41 is a sum of squares ( sos ) , that is , there is some integer @xmath42 and some matrix polynomial @xmath43^{p\\times n}$ ] such that @xmath44      if @xmath6 is sos - convex and @xmath45 is sos - convex for every @xmath4 , then @xmath39 . more precisely , ( [ main ] ) holds for some convex sos polynomial @xmath37 and some nonnegative scalars @xmath38 , @xmath4 .    from proposition",
    "[ prop1 ] , let @xmath35 be as in ( [ lagrangian ] ) . as @xmath6 and @xmath45 are sos convex , write @xmath46 for some @xmath43^{p\\times n}$ ] and some @xmath47^{p_j\\times n}$ ] , @xmath4 .",
    "hence , @xmath48 with @xmath49 $ ] , and so @xmath35 is sos - convex . as ( [ kkt2 ] )",
    "holds , by lemma 3.2 in helton and nie @xcite , the polynomial @xmath35 is sos , and so , by corollary [ coro1 ] , the desired result ( [ main ] ) holds .",
    "next , consider the subset @xmath50 defined by : @xmath51 the set @xmath10 is a specialization of @xmath9 to the convex case , in that the weights asociated with the @xmath8 s are nonnegative scalars , i.e. , sos polynomials of degree 0 , and the sos polynomial @xmath40 is convex .",
    "[ thmain2 ] let assumption [ ass1 ] hold , and let @xmath10 be as in ( [ qc ] ) .",
    "let @xmath52 $ ] be the convex cone of convex polynomials nonnegative on @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath11 is dense in @xmath13 for the @xmath12-norm @xmath53 . in particular , if @xmath54 ( so that @xmath13 is now the set of nonnegative convex polynomials ) , then @xmath55 is dense in @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath56 and let @xmath57 .",
    "given @xmath58 , let @xmath59 $ ] be the polynomial @xmath60 for every @xmath61 , the polynomial @xmath62 is convex and nonnegative on @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , @xmath64 for some @xmath65 . indeed , the level set @xmath66 is compact for every @xmath67 , and so , @xmath68 attains its minimum on @xmath1 .",
    "obviously , we also have @xmath69 as @xmath70 .",
    "next , let @xmath71 be as in ( [ lagrangian ] ) , i.e. , @xmath72 for some nonnegative vector @xmath73 . as @xmath74 on @xmath75 , by corollary 3.3 in lasserre and netzer @xcite , there exists @xmath76 such that for every @xmath77",
    ", @xmath78 is sos .",
    "that is , @xmath79 and so @xmath80 notice that by definition , @xmath37 is convex .",
    "next , as @xmath81 , @xmath82 , and so , equivalently , @xmath83 .",
    "one may also replace @xmath91 in ( [ theta ] ) with the new perturbation @xmath92 this perturbation also preserves convexity .",
    "in addition , not only @xmath93 as @xmath70 , but the convergence @xmath94 is also _ uniform _ on compact sets !    1 j.w .",
