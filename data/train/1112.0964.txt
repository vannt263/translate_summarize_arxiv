    "despite the fact that the history of the high-@xmath0 cuprates exceeds two decades , there remain a number of fundamental questions which are yet to be resolved . among them",
    "is the significant variation of @xmath0 among various materials within the cuprate family .",
    "it is well known that @xmath0 varies strongly with the number of cuo@xmath8 layers , but an even more basic problem is the @xmath0 variation within the single - layered materials .",
    "this is highlighted by la@xmath9(sr / ba)@xmath10cuo@xmath11 with a @xmath12 k versus hgba@xmath8cuo@xmath13 with a @xmath14k , with a more than factor of two difference despite similar crystal structures between them .",
    "empirically , it has been recognized that the materials with @xmath15k tend to have `` round '' fermi surfaces , while the fermi surface of the la system is closer to a diamond shape , and this has posed a long - standing , big puzzle , since , the latter would imply a relatively better nesting@xcite .",
    "the materials with rounded fermi surfaces conventionally have been analyzed with a single - band model with large second ( @xmath16 ) and third ( @xmath17 ) neighbor hopping integrals , while the `` low-@xmath0 '' la system has been considered to have smaller @xmath18 .",
    "this , however , has brought about a contradiction between theories and experiments .",
    "namely , while some phenomenological@xcite and @xmath19-@xmath20 model@xcite studies give a tendency consistent with the experiments , a number of many - body approaches for the _ hubbard - type _ models with realistic values of on - site interaction @xmath21 show suppression of superconductivity for large @xmath22 and/or @xmath23 , as we shall indeed confirm below@xcite .    to resolve this discrepancy , we have introduced in ref.@xcite a two - orbital model that explicitly incorporates the @xmath2 orbital as well , while the usual wisdom was that the @xmath1 orbital suffices .",
    "the former component has in fact a significant contribution to the fermi surface in the la system .",
    "we have shown that the key parameter that determines @xmath0 is the hybridization of the two - orbitals , which is in turn governed by the level offset @xmath3 between the @xmath1 and @xmath2 wannier orbitals .",
    "namely , the weaker the @xmath2 contribution to the fermi surface , the better for @xmath5-wave superconductivity , where a weaker contribution of the @xmath2 results in a rounded fermi surface ( which in itself is not desirable for superconductivity ) , but it is the `` single - orbital nature '' that favors a higher @xmath0 superseding the effect of the fermi surface shape . recently , there have also been some other theoretical studies regarding the role of the @xmath2 orbital played in the cuprates@xcite .    purpose of the present paper is two - fold : by elaborating the two - orbital model , we investigate ( i ) why the @xmath2 hybridization on the fermi surface suppresses the superconductivity , and ( ii ) what are the key components that determine the material dependence in the level offset between @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in examining point ( ii ) , in addition to la@xmath8cuo@xmath11 and hgba@xmath8cuo@xmath13 considered in ref.@xcite , we also construct effective models of the single - layered cuprates bi@xmath8sr@xmath8cuo@xmath24 and tl@xmath8ba@xmath8cuo@xmath24 to reveal how these materials can be classified in terms of the correlation between the lattice structure parameters and the level offsets of various orbits .",
    "let us start with the first - principles band calculation@xcite of la@xmath8cuo@xmath11 and hgba@xmath8cuo@xmath11 , whose band structures are displayed in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the lattice parameters adopted here are experimentally determined ones for the doped materials@xcite . in both cases , there is only one band intersecting the fermi level .",
    "therefore , the @xmath1 single - orbital hubbard model , or the cu-@xmath1 @xmath25 o-@xmath26 three - orbital model ( whose antibonding band crosses the fermi level ) has been adopted in conventional theoretical studies . a large difference between the two materials in the shape of the fermi surface",
    "is confirmed in fig.[fig2 ] . as mentioned in the introduction ,",
    "the materials with a rounded fermi surface have been modeled by a single - orbital model with large second [ @xmath16 ] and third [ @xmath17 ] neighbor hopping integrals@xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that when the fluctuation exchange approximation ( flex)@xcite is applied to this model , a rounder fermi surface coming from larger second and third neighbor hoppings results in a suppressed @xmath0 , as we have shown in fig.1 of ref .. a calculation with the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) shows that a negative @xmath29 works destructively against @xmath5-wave superconductivity@xcite , and a more realistic dca calculation that considers the oxygen @xmath30 orbitals for the la and hg cuprates also indicates a similar tendency@xcite .",

    ", width=264 ]      to resolve the above problem for the @xmath1 single - orbital model , we now focus on other orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "in fact , fig.[fig1 ] shows that in the la system the main band has a strong @xmath2 character around the n point on the fermi surface that corresponds to the wave vectors @xmath31 in a square lattice .",
    "this has been recognized from an early stage of the study on the cuprates @xcite , and more recently , it has been discussed in refs.@xcite that the mixture of @xmath2 character to the main component determines the shape of the fermi surface .",
    "namely , the large @xmath2 contribution in the la system makes the fermi surface closer to a square ( i.e. , a diamond ) , while in the hg cuprate the @xmath2 contribution is small and the fermi surface is more rounded ( as confirmed in the following ) .    in order to understand the experimentally observed correlation between the fermi surface shape and @xmath0",
    ", we consider a two - orbital model that takes into account not only the @xmath1 wannier orbital but also the @xmath2 wannier orbital explicitly@xcite .",
    "a first - principles calculation@xcite is used to construct maximally localized wannier orbitals@xcite , from which the hopping integrals and the on - site energies of the two - orbital tight - binding model for the la and hg cuprates are deduced .",
    "thus obtained band structures of the two - orbital model for the la and hg cuprates are shown in fig.[fig3 ] , along with the fermi surface for the band filling of @xmath32 ( @xmath33number of electrons per site ) , which corresponds to 0.15 holes per cu atom .    ) in the two - orbital ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) model for la@xmath8cuo@xmath11 ( left column ) and hgba@xmath8cuo@xmath11 ( right ) .",
    "the top ( middle ) panels depict the weights of the @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) characters with thickened lines , while the bottom panels are the fermi surface for the band filling of @xmath32 .",
    "the inset shows the band structure of the three - orbital model ( see text ) for la system , where the 4s character is indicated by thick lines.,width=264 ]    in the present two - orbital model , the @xmath1 wannier orbital originates primarily from the cu 3@xmath1 and the in - plane o 2@xmath34 orbitals . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath2 wannier orbital originates mainly from the cu 3@xmath2 and apical o 2@xmath35 orbitals .",
    "namely , this model incorporates two types of @xmath5-@xmath30 antibonding states , where the former spreads over the cuo@xmath8-plane while the latter along the @xmath36-axis(fig.[fig4 ] ) .",
    "table[table1 ] shows the parameter values of the present model , from which we can identify that @xmath37 interorbital hopping occurs mainly between nearest - neighbor cu sites , which gives rise to the orbital mixture .",
    "because the @xmath37 hopping integrals are similar for the la and hg compounds , the onsite energy difference @xmath38 between the two orbitals can be used as a measure of the @xmath2 mixture .",
    "note that the interorbital hoppings have different signs between @xmath39 and @xmath40 directions , i.e. , the matrix element has the form @xmath41 $ ] , so that the @xmath37 mixture is strong around the wave vectors @xmath42 ( n point in the la cuprate ) , while small around @xmath43 .    in table[table1 ]",
    "we also show the parameters for the single - orbital model obtained by the similar method . in the single - orbital model",
    ", the `` @xmath1 '' wannier orbital effectively contains the @xmath2 orbital in the tail parts of the wannier orbital .    .hopping integrals within the @xmath1 orbital for the single- and two - orbital models ( upper half ) , interorbital hopping ( middle ) , and @xmath44 ( bottom ) .",

    ", width=264 ]",
    "in the present study , we have adopted the lda to derive the kinetic - energy part of the model hamiltonian .",
    "the lda calculation neglects some of the electron correlation effects , and our standpoint in the present study is that the remaining part of the electron correlation is dealt with in the flex calculation .",
    "one might suspect , however , that there might remain electron correlation effects , that are not taken into account in the present approach but can affect the accuracy of the evaluation of the level offset @xmath3 between @xmath1 and @xmath2 wannier orbitals .",
    "our view on this point is the following .",
    "first , it is an experimental fact that the la cuprate has a square - like fermi surface , while the bi cuprate a rounded one@xcite .",
    "this is accurately reproduced in the lda , which strongly suggests that the @xmath2 component is indeed strongly mixed around @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath3 is small , in the la cuprate .",
    "secondly , a detailed quantitative difference in @xmath3 will not affect the present conclusions . to see this ,",
    "we have performed an lda+u calculation to obtain the kinetic - energy part of the hamiltonian , varying @xmath21 from 0 to @xmath46 ev . for la ,",
    "the considerable @xmath2-character around @xmath31 persists even at @xmath47 , and the band that intersects the fermi level is only slightly changed , although @xmath3 somewhat increases with @xmath21 . on the other hand , for",
    "hg @xmath3 is greatly enhanced by @xmath21 , but this does not significantly affect the @xmath1 main band , since the @xmath2 character is already absent at @xmath48 . applying flex to these lda+u models will result in a double counting of the electron correlation effects because flex takes account of the first - order terms , but if we took , for the sake of comparison , the obtained @xmath3 , we would find that a considerable difference in @xmath49 between la ( @xmath50 ) and hg ( @xmath51 ) is still present even if we adopt the modified values of @xmath3 .",
    "a consequence of our study is that superconductivity in the single - layered cuprates is optimized when the system has a single - band nature .",
    "in such a case ( as in hg cuprate ) , the fermi surface is rounded due to the effect of the cu 4s orbital . as mentioned in section[iia ]",
    ", the square shaped fermi surface would be more favorable for superconductivity for single - orbital systems .",
    "for this very reason even the hgba@xmath8cuo@xmath13 is not fully optimized as a single - layered material .",
    "indeed , the hypothetical la cuprate having a large @xmath3 but with a fermi surface similar to that in the original la gives a larger @xmath49 in the eliashberg equation as we have seen in section [ iiid ] .",
    "so we have a bit of a dilemma , since it would be difficult to get rid of the effect of the cu 4s orbital _ as far as the cuprates are concerned_. conversely , however , we can seek for other materials in which the @xmath52 orbital is not effective .",
    "an example is a single - band system consisting of @xmath53 orbitals , where the hybridization between @xmath53 and @xmath52 orbitals is forbidden by symmetry .",
    "in fact , a possible way of realizing a single - band @xmath53 system has been proposed in ref.@xcite .",
    "provided that such a system has the band width and the electron - electron interaction strength similar to those in the cuprates ( since too strong or too weak a correlation will degrade superconductivity ) , it can possibly give even higher @xmath0 .",
    "to summarize , we have studied a two - orbital model that considers both @xmath1 and @xmath2 wannier orbitals in order to pinpoint the key factors governing the material dependence of @xmath0 within the single - layered cuprates .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath2 orbital mixture on the fermi surface is significantly degrades superconductivity .",
    "since the energy difference @xmath3 between the @xmath4 and the @xmath2 governs the mixture as well as the shape of the fermi surface , we identify @xmath3 as the key parameter in the material dependence of @xmath0 in the cuprates . since the mixing effect supersede the effect of the fermi surface nesting , a small @xmath3 results in a suppression of @xmath0 despite a square shaped fermi surface .",
    "@xmath3 is then shown to be determined by the energy difference @xmath6 between the two cu3d orbitals , and the energy difference @xmath7 between the o@xmath54 @xmath34 and o@xmath55 @xmath35 , both of which are affected by the lattice structure .",
    "@xmath6 is a crystal field splitting , which is mainly determined by the apical oxygen height , while @xmath7 is found to be primarily governed by the interlayer separation @xmath5 .",
    "the materials that have highest @xmath0s within the single - layered cuprates , hg are tl systems , indeed have @xmath3 large enough to make them essentially single - band . on the other hand",
    ", there is still room for improvement if we can suppress the effect of the cu @xmath52 mixing that makes the fermi surface rounded , which may be realized in non - cuprate materials with @xmath21 similar to the cuprates in magnitude .",
