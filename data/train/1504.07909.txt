    ", the impact of the @xmath13 on the @xmath10 cross section clearly should be explored . in particular , should it turn out that its contribution is rather large , then it would be certainly interesting to examine the energy range in question in pertinent experiments , which could be performed by the panda collaboration @xcite at the future fair facility in darmstadt .    in the present study we consider the effect of the @xmath13 on the @xmath10 cross section .",
    "the work complements our results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and builds on the jlich meson - baryon model for the reaction @xmath18 @xcite where the extension of the model from the strangeness to the charm sector follows a strategy similar to other studies by us on the @xmath19 and @xmath20 interactions  @xcite , and on the reaction @xmath21",
    "@xcite , namely by assuming as a working hypothesis su(4 ) symmetry constraints .",
    "the framework in which we treat the charm - production reaction @xmath7 is described in detail in ref .",

    "we summarize only the principal features .",
    "the reaction amplitude for @xmath7 is obtained within the distorted - wave born approximation .",
    "effects of the initial as well as of the final - state interactions , which play an important role for energies near the production threshold @xcite , are taken into account rigorously .",
    "the employed @xmath22 and @xmath16 amplitudes are solutions of lippmann - schwinger type scattering equations based on corresponding ( @xmath22 and @xmath16 ) interaction potentials .",
    "the microscopic charm - production process itself is described by baryon exchange ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) , in close analogy to an investigation of the strangeness production reaction @xmath18 by the jlich group @xcite .",
    "specifically , the transition potential is derived from the corresponding transition in the @xmath25 case under the assumption of su(4 ) symmetry , see ref .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "because of the known sensitivity of the results for the cross sections on the initial @xmath26 interaction we examined its effect by considering several variants of the @xmath22 potential",
    ". details of those potentials can be found in refs .",
    "here we just want to mention that they differ primarily in the elastic part where we consider variations from keeping only the longest ranged contribution ( one - pion exchange ) to taking a full g - parity transformed @xmath27 interaction as done in @xcite .",
    "all those models reproduce the total @xmath26 cross section in the relevant energy range and , in general , describe also data on integrated elastic and charge - exchange cross sections and even @xmath26 differential cross sections , cf . refs .",

    "the interaction in the @xmath16 system is constructed along the lines of the jlich meson exchange model for the @xmath28 interaction whose evaluation has been discussed in detail in refs .",

    "we were guided by su(4 ) symmetry @xcite .",
    "thus , we included @xmath33-channel exchanges of those vector mesons which are from the same su(4 ) multiplet as those included in the original jlich model and , moreover , we assumed that all coupling constants at the additional three - meson vertices are given by su(4 ) relations .",
    "indeed , in ref .",
    "@xcite an even more extended model was considered which included also the coupling to channels involving the charmed strange meson @xmath34(1969 ) .",
    "it turned out that the @xmath16 production cross sections based on the @xmath16 interactions with or without coupling to @xmath35 are almost identical and , therefore , in the present work we show only the results for the latter case .",
    "the scattering amplitudes are obtained by solving a coupled channel scattering equation for these potentials which is formally given by @xmath36 with @xmath37 .    in an approach like ours",
    "the @xmath13 ( in the following usually called @xmath2 to simplify the notation ) has to be included as bare resonance .",

    "the values for the mass and width of the @xmath13 were determined by evaluating the speed plot for @xmath44 for simplicity reasons .",

    "the cross section in the @xmath50 state is very small .",

    "the pertinent calculation was performed in the migdal - watson approximation @xcite , i.e. by assuming that @xmath55 , so that the cross section for @xmath15 is given by @xmath56 here @xmath57 is the @xmath16 center - of - mass momentum and @xmath58 an arbitrary normalization factor that has to be adjusted to the data .",
    "the shown curve is based on the @xmath16 @xmath49 amplitude in the @xmath12 wave . in this case",
    "a factor @xmath59 has to be divided out because in @xmath15 the incoming @xmath16 state is not on - shell and , therefore , does not feel the angular - momentum threshold factor @xcite .",
    "our result is in remarkably good agreement with the measured line shape . in particular ,",
    "the strong fall - off after the peak value is very well described .",
    "as mentioned , we adjusted our resonance parameters to the `` our fit '' value of the pdg .",
    "no fine tuning to the actual data was done because we are primarily interested in studying the effect of the @xmath13 on @xmath10 observables and not on pinning down its resonance parameters . as already said ,",
    "there is an uncertainty in the order of @xmath60 mev with regard to the actual resonance mass @xcite . for more detailed analyses of the @xmath15 data , see refs .",
    "results for the reaction @xmath10 are presented in figs .  [ fig : b ] and [ fig : c ] .",
    "we performed again calculations for all @xmath26 isi considered in our previous work @xcite .",
    "however , we refrain from showing bands here because we wanted to highlight the impact of the @xmath13 and this information would have been otherwise hidden in the band .",
    "nonetheless , the variations due to the isi can be still read off because we present curves corresponding to the largest and smallest predictions for the @xmath61 and @xmath62 cross sections .    the solid and dash - dotted lines in figs .",
    "[ fig : b ] and [ fig : c ] are results with inclusion of the @xmath13 resonance while the dashed and dotted curves are based on the @xmath16 fsi without the @xmath2 , i.e. correspond to the case considered already in ref .",
    "please recall that in our calculation the @xmath2 is only included in the @xmath16 interaction and , therefore , its effects come exclusively from the corresponding fsi . in principle , there could be also a coupling of the ( bare ) @xmath2 to the @xmath22 system which would then contribute to the @xmath10 transition potential .",
    "however , we assume here that this possible coupling is negligibly small  because it is suppressed by the ozi rule .",
    "after all , it requires the annihilation of 3 up- and/or down quark pairs and the creation of a @xmath63 quark pair ; see discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : estimates ] .",
    "it is obvious that the @xmath13 resonance leads to a pronounced enhancement in the @xmath16 production cross section .",
    "especially , for the @xmath64 final state the cross section predicted around the resonance peak is now practically twice as large .",
    "quantitatively , our calculation suggests that the cross section due to the @xmath13 resonance could be the order of @xmath5 to @xmath6 nb .",
    "the effect is less dramatic in the @xmath65 case because here the @xmath11-wave contributions are fairly large .",
    "still for both reactions there should be good chances that one can see a clear resonance signal over the background ( that comes mostly from the @xmath11 wave ) in an actual experiment .    a comparison of the two results with and of the two without @xmath13 resonance ( solid versus dashed line or dash - dotted versus dotted line , respectively ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : b ] allows one to see the uncertainties in the predictions due to the employed @xmath26 interactions .",
    "those are substantial but not really dramatic as already discussed in ref .",
    "there is a somewhat larger uncertainty with regard to the contribution of the @xmath13 resonance which , however , is not too suprising .",
    "conservation of total angular momentum and parity implies that the @xmath16 @xmath11 wave is produced from the @xmath22 @xmath66 partial wave while the @xmath16 @xmath12 wave is produced from the @xmath22 @xmath67-@xmath68 partial wave .",
    "since the @xmath67 partial wave is much more sensitive to short - range physics than higher partial waves there is also a stronger variation in the corresponding amplitudes for the various @xmath22 potentials considered as isi .",
    "the thin solid lines indicate what happens if we employ a @xmath16 fsi that is fitted to the higher value given for the @xmath13 resonance , i.e. to @xmath54 mev @xcite . in this case",
    "the contribution of the @xmath2 to the @xmath10 cross section is smaller by about 15 - 20 % and , of course , the peak is shifted to the higher energy .",
    "differential cross sections for @xmath61 and @xmath62 at @xmath69 gev / c are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c ] .",
    "this momentum corresponds to a total energy of @xmath70 mev so that the results display the situation practically at the resonance peak . as mentioned before @xcite without the @xmath13 the @xmath16 pair",
    "is produced predominantly in the @xmath11 wave , cf .",
    "the dashed / dotted curves . of course ,",
    "this changes drastically once the resonance is included ( solid / dash - dotted curves ) .",
    "still , there is a strong interference between the @xmath11- and @xmath12 waves , especially in the @xmath65 case , so that the actual angular distribution does not resemble the one one expects from pure @xmath12-wave scattering .",
    "it is possible to provide a rough estimation of the @xmath10 cross section around the @xmath13 peak using experimental information by exploiting the fact that at energies very close to the resonance the reaction amplitude can be well approximated by @xmath71 an expression which is indeed exact at the @xmath13 pole . here , @xmath72 is the dressed vertex function with @xmath73 , @xmath26 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 and @xmath76 the physical mass and width of the @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "the cross section resulting from this amplitude can be cast into the form @xmath77 i.e. into the standard breit - wigner formula . here",
    "@xmath78 is the total angular momentum , @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the spins of the particles in the incoming channel , @xmath81 is the center - of - mass momentum in the incoming channel , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the partial widths for the decay of the @xmath84 into the channels @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "there are cross section data on the reactions @xmath87 @xcite and @xmath88 @xcite in the vicinity of the @xmath13 resonance . together with unitarity constraints for @xmath89 they allow one to determine all the @xmath82 s needed for estimating the @xmath10 cross section . with regard to the @xmath89 cross section , we assume for simplicity that @xmath90  which is anyway consistent with the pdg listing @xcite  so that the cross section is given by the unitarity bound . at the energy corresponding to the @xmath13 resonance this amounts to @xmath91 mb .",
    "assuming that the @xmath50 @xmath12-wave amplitude is small , which is indeed the case in our model ( cf .",
    "[ ddb ] ) yields @xmath92 mb .",
    "the measured @xmath93 cross section at the @xmath13 resonance peaks at about @xmath94 nb @xcite while the analysis of the @xmath88 cross section performed in ref .",
    "@xcite suggests that the contribution due to the @xmath13 resonance could amount to either @xmath95 or @xmath96 pb . combining those results and using eq .",
    "( [ bwc ] ) to determine the various @xmath82 s we deduce for @xmath97 a cross section of either @xmath98 nb or around @xmath99 nb .",
    "there is a large uncertainty for the lower value that follows from the besiii analysis but , still , one could argue that it is roughly in line with our theory prediction .",
    "as alternative let us consider also an estimate that follows from a qcd - based perturbative approach to charmonium decays into baryon - antibaryon pairs @xcite .",
    "that approach relies on a factorized expression for the @xmath100 decay amplitude into a @xmath101 annihilation amplitude and the @xmath2 wave function at the origin  see , e.g. , eqs .",
