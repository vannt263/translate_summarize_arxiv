    "in classical general relativity there are many solutions of einstein equations with closed timelike curves ( ctcs ) @xcite . however , some early calculations of vacuum polarization in spacetimes with ctcs indicated that the renormalized stress - energy tensor diverged at the cauchy horizon or the polarized hypersurfaces @xcite . hawking",
    "thus proposed the chronology protection conjecture which stated that physical laws do not allow the appearance of ctcs @xcite .",
    "but , many counter - examples to the chronology protection conjecture have been found @xcite . in particular , li and",
    "gott @xcite have found a self - consistent vacuum for a massless conformally coupled scalar field in misner space ( see also @xcite ) , which gives an example of a time machine ( i.e. a spacetime with ctcs ) at the semi - classical level ( i.e. the background spacetime is classical but the matter fields are quantized )",
    ".    of more interest , recently gott and li have discovered that ctcs could play an important role in the early universe : if we trace backward the history of time , we may enter an early epoch of ctcs , which means that there is no earliest event in time @xcite . according to the theory of quantum foam @xcite , in the early universe ( at the planck epoch ) , quantum fluctuations of spacetime should be very important and the spacetime might have a very complicated topology .",
    "very strong fluctuations in the metric of spacetime could cause the lightcones to distribute randomly , which could give rise to a sea of ctcs in the early universe .",
    "therefore , we might expect that at very early epochs , the universe could have a tangled network of ctcs .",
    "one model of the creation of the universe is the model of  tunneling from nothing \" @xcite . in this model",
    "the universe is supposed to be a lorentzian spacetime [ with signature @xmath1 glued to an early euclidean space [ with signature @xmath2 , thus the universe has a beginning in time ( i.e. the beginning of the lorentzian section ) .",
    "this model of  tunneling from nothing \" has some shortcomings ( see @xcite , and penrose in @xcite )",
    ". contrasting with the model of  tunneling from nothing \" , in the model of gott and li @xcite , the universe does not need a signature change and has no beginning in time .",
    "gott and li s universe is always a lorentzian spacetime but at a very early epoch there is a loop of time .",
    "the universe could thus be its own mother and create itself .",
    "the model of gott and li has some additional interesting features : the present epoch of the universe is separated from the early ctcs epoch by a past chronology horizon .",
    "the only self - consistent solution with this geometry has pure retarded potentials , creating naturally an arrow of time in our current universe , which is consistent with our experience @xcite .",
    "thus , ctcs have potentially important applications in the early universe .",
    "anti - de  sitter space is a spacetime which has ctcs everywhere .",
    "it is a solution of the vacuum einstein equation with a negative cosmological constant and has maximum symmetry @xcite .",
    "anti - de  sitter space plays a very important role in theories of supergravity and superstrings @xcite .",
    "if we  unfold \" anti - de  sitter space and go to its covering space , the ctcs disappear . however ,",
    "if we identify the events related by boost transformations in the covering space of anti - de  sitter space , we will get a spacetime with an infinite number of regions with ctcs and an infinite number of regions without ctcs , where the regions with ctcs and the regions without ctcs are separated by chronology horizons .",
    "the causal structure is similar to that of misner space , except that misner space has only two regions with ctcs and two regions without ctcs . for misner space , li and gott",
    "have found a self - consistent vacuum for a massless conformally coupled scalar field , which is an `` adapted '' rindler vacuum ( i.e. a rindler vacuum with multiple images ) @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will show that a self - consistent vacuum also exists for a massless conformally coupled scalar field in the misner - like anti - de  sitter space constructed above , which is simply the conformal transformation of li and gott s adapted rindler vacuum .    in 1993 ,",
    "li , xu , and liu constructed a time machine in a space with a complex metric @xcite . in this paper we will show that the lorentzian section of that solution is just the misner - like anti - de  sitter space described above .",
    "inflation theory proposes that during an early epoch the universe was in a state with an effective positive cosmological constant at the gut ( or planck ) scale @xcite , which is well - described as a de  sitter phase . by transition to a zero cosmological constant ( through either quantum tunneling or classical evolution ) , the universe then enters a friedmann big bang stage .",
    "but , if there is a transition to a negative cosmological constant ( it does not seem physical theories exclude a negative cosmological constant  especially since in supergravity and superstring theories anti - de  sitter space is the only known self - consistent solution besides minkowski space @xcite ) , the universe could enter an anti - de  sitter phase where ctcs exist . in this paper",
    "we will consider some models describing the transition between a de  sitter space and an anti - de  sitter space , which are obtained by gluing a de  sitter space to an anti - de  sitter space along a bubble wall , and we will show that self - consistent vacua for these solutions also exist .",
    "the generalization to the case of electromagnetic fields and massless neutrinos will also be considered .",
    "it is argued that , in order to be consistent with euclidean quantization , a new renormalization procedure for quantum fields in misner - type spaces is required .",

    "a self - consistent solution can be obtained if there is a single negative bare cosmological constant in the two regions with the renormalized stress - energy tensor of vacuum polarization adding different positive cosmological constants to the two sides of the bubble wall so that the effective cosmological constant ( bare @xmath318 renormalized ) is positive on one side and negative on the other . on the hypersurface separating de  sitter space from anti - de  sitter space , in order that the einstein equations are satisfied , a surface stress - energy tensor should be induced . if the hypersurface is timelike , the surface stress - energy tensor is like that of a three - dimensional positive cosmological constant",

    "if the bare cosmological constant is negative , there are also two self - consistent solutions , one of them is an anti - de  sitter space , but the other is a sub - planckian scale de  sitter space . and , at the sub - planckian scale , self - consistent solutions ( either de  sitter space or anti - de  sitter space ) exist only for a bare negative cosmological constant",
