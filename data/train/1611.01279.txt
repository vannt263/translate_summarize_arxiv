    "as various technologies for submillimeter ( submm ) wave observations have advanced , the prospects for very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) at submm wavelengths have become a reality .",
    "operations at shorter wavelengths improve proportionately the spatial resolution as compared with current centimeter and millimeter vlbi observations ; we anticipate that it will be possible to resolve astronomical sources in greater details , by a factor of 10 .",
    "the demand for better angular resolution is quite strong , especially for the direct imaging of nearby supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) ; sagittarius a@xmath7 ( sgr a@xmath7 ) , which is located at the center of our galaxy and therefore the nearest smbh , has been imaged at various wavelengths using the vlbi technique .",
    "the observed size of sgr a@xmath7 is obviously affected by the interstellar scattering at 3 mm or longer wavelengths , following the @xmath8 scattering law ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this effect , however , lessens at shorter wavelengths , and the size is observed to deviate from the @xmath8 scattering law at 1.3 mm @xcite .",
    "this has strongly motivated submm - vlbi observations toward nearby smbhs to resolve and image emission from their vicinities .",
    "upper limits of the intrinsic sizes of smbhs have been measured so far for sgr a@xmath7 @xcite and the nucleus of m87 @xcite ; upper limits to the sizes of both sources are about @xmath9arcsec .",
    "these results indicate that much longer baselines and/or higher frequencies are needed to resolve and image the smbhs .",
    "we , therefore , started to look for a new site to perform submm - vlbi observations with substantially longer baselines than before .",
    "for the site selection , we set criteria as follows :    1 .   annual precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) of less than 3 mm for low submm opacity .",
    "longest possible baselines with existing submm telescopes , for obtaining the highest angular resolution ( this also means that we do not consider sites that already have submm telescopes ) .",
    "3 .   overlapping sky coverage with the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) to achieve the highest possible sensitivity .",
    "accessibility to the site for maintenance and operations .",
    "we checked the satellite - based pwv data measured by the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer ( modis ) on the nasa aqua and terra satellites for potential sites with respect to the locations of the available submm telescopes .",
    "we found three potential broad regions of interest ; western china and tibet , the highest mountains of southern alaska , and the high arctic polar desert , including northern canada and greenland .",
    "the western china and tibet regions do not have common sky with alma , so they do not meet the criterion ( 3 ) .",
    "the tallest peaks in alaska ( e.g. , denali , or former official name mount mckinley ) are protected or otherwise inaccessible , so they do not meet the criterion ( 4 ) .",
    "the summit of the greenland ice sheet , on the other hand , has low pwv conditions throughout the year , has a common sky coverage with alma , will create the longest baseline length of about 9000 km for the submm - vlbi , and already has a research facility , summit camp , which is operated by ch2 m hill .",
    "polar services ( cps ) for the u.s .  national science foundation ( nsf ) .",
    "the summit camp , therefore , meets all four criteria .",
    "the greenland summit camp is located at @xmath10 n latitude and @xmath11 w longitude , at an altitude of 3200 m. the temperature is very low , with winter temperatures between @xmath12c and @xmath13c , and summer temperatures between @xmath14c and @xmath12c @xcite . due to the combination of the high altitude and the low temperature , very low opacity is expected .",
    "furthermore , the nsf is currently funding the integrated characterization of energy , clouds , atmospheric state , and precipitation ( icecaps ) project at the summit camp , which is using active and passive ground - based remote sensors , including two radiometers that observe 16 frequencies from 22.2 ghz to 150.0 ghz , to provide the first complete description of cloud properties above this site @xcite .",
    "they determine the annual cycle of pwv using the radiometer observations at the central frequencies of 23.8 , 31.4 , 90 , and 150 ghz as well as from radiosondes that are launched twice daily by icecaps technicians .",
    "we , therefore , decided to put a 225 ghz tipping radiometer at this site to measure the atmospheric opacity conditions for possible submm vlbi operations ( see the next section for the reason to choose the measurement frequency ) .",
    "our group is in the process of deploying a 12 m diameter submm telescope to greenland .",
    "overall explanations of this project , the greenland telescope ( glt ) project , are described in @xcite for submm - vlbi science and technical details , and in @xcite for single - dish science cases .",
    "in addition , more detailed information about antennas , receivers , and software for the glt project are in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , respectively .",
    "for the opacity measurement at the summit of the greenland ice sheet , we procured a 225 ghz tipping radiometer , rpg-225 radiometer , from radiometer physics gmbh ( rpg ) .",
    "this instrument has the ability to operate in very cold environments , and indeed some units are operating at arctic and antarctic areas ( two radiometers operating as part of icecaps mentioned above are also from rpg ) .",
    "the reason for the choice of this operating frequency is that there are many site survey results from all over the world , including the current submm telescope sites , such as the summit of mauna kea , the alma ( chajnantor and pampa la bola ) site , and south pole .",
    "the radiometer has an uncooled double side band heterodyne receiver with a bandwidth of 1 ghz . a tipping paraboloid mirror , which can rotate @xmath15 with its half power beam width of @xmath16 , is installed in front of the feed horn .",
    "a gortex window covers @xmath17 from zenith to allow sampling of the sky signal , and a black body target , whose temperature is monitored by a thermometer , is located at the bottom ( i.e. , @xmath18 from zenith ) .",
    "a 140 w blower is located below the window and provides heating to prevent ice formation and accumulation on the window .",
    "we obtained the radiometer in the autumn of 2010 , deployed it on the roof of our institute in taipei , and conducted functional and gain stability tests .",
    "we then moved the radiometer to the summit of mauna kea , hawaii , in the end of 2010 , to check the consistency with the 225 ghz tipping radiometer at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) .",
    "we put our radiometer near the cso with the same tipping direction , measured the opacity for about 2 weeks , and confirmed that the results were consistent with each other ( linear regression coefficient = 1.04 ) . after this , we moved the radiometer to the polar environment atmospheric research laboratory ( pearl ) , located on a ridge at an altitude of 610 m at @xmath19 n and @xmath20 w , 15 km away from the eureka weather station on ellesmere island , canada .",
    "we measured the atmospheric opacity for 3 months between late winter to early spring , and the results are reported in @xcite and @xcite . after this measurement , we moved the radiometer to the greenland summit camp .",
    "the radiometer was installed on the roof of the mobile science facility ( msf ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which was built by cps in support of the icecaps project .",
    "the roof deck is at about 3 m above the snow surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig - rpg ] ) .",
    "the measurement was started from august 17th , 2011 , and data were collected until february 12th , 2015 .",
    "we present here the data for these @xmath21 years .",
    "to measure the atmospheric opacity , we adopt the tipping method ; we observe five angles from horizon ( @xmath22 = zenith , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , which corresponds to @xmath27 of 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , and 3.0 ) with 4 second integration at each angle .",
    "we scan the mirror from south to north , namely observe the five angles in both the southern and the northern sky ( for the measurements at greenland ) . the black body target in the bottom of the radiometer",
    "is observed before and after the scan for the gain calibration .",
    "the total duration of a tipping measurement is 75 seconds , and each tipping is performed every 10 minutes . between the tipping measurements ,",
    "the mirror is pointed toward the zenith and the sky data are recorded every 1 second .",
    "the output voltages , together with the mirror position , the black body target temperature , and other monitoring data , are recorded every 1 second into the hard disk of the host computer in binary format .",
    "the raw binary data are downloaded from greenland to taiwan regularly via internet .    ]",
    "the tipping data have been reduced with the typical data reduction method for tipping measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "since the msf is a mobile facility on the snow , it can shake due to wind or human activities inside the facility , so that the radiometer tipping angle may be affected .",
    "in addition , the leveling accuracy for the radiometer is limited , so that the radiometer may also have a small constant tilt .",
    "we assume that the opacity is the same between the southern and northern skies , and the small difference in opacities derived from the southern and northern sky tippings is considered as the result of the tilt of msf and/or the radiometer .",
    "based on this assumption , we calculate the tilt angle and correct for it when deriving the opacity . in case",
    "the difference of the opacities between the southern and northern skies is large ( i.e. , when the tilt angle is calculated to be larger than two degrees ; this value is also to allow some tolerance for the different opacities between the northern and southern sky ) , we judge this is due to real opacity differences , and we flag the data .",
    "[ fig - time ] displays the measured time variation of the 225 ghz opacity for the 3.5-year period at the greenland summit camp .",
    "it is clear that there is a seasonal variation ; opacity in winter is low , but high in summer . fig .",
    "[ fig - month ] shows the monthly quartile variations ( solid , dashed , and dotted lines are 25% , 50% , and 75% quartiles , respectively ) .",
    "december and march tend to have the best opacity conditions , and july tends to have the worst .",
    "note that the first and the last months of this measurement ( i.e. , aug .",
    "2011 and feb .",
    "2015 ) have fewer data than the other months , so the statistical significance is lower . in both diagrams , there is no significant annual difference .",
    "we also made cumulative distribution plots and histograms of the measured 225 ghz opacity while separating the seasons into winter and summer ( fig .",
    "[ fig - cdp ] ) . here",
    "we define winter as between the beginning of november and the end of april ( solid line plots ) , and summer as may through october ( dashed line plots ) .",
    "the quartiles for each season are 0.046 , 0.060 , and 0.080 for 25% , 50% , and 75% , respectively , in winter , and 0.089 , 0.118 , and 0.159 for summer ( see also the crosses and the values in the figure ) .",
    "it is obvious that the opacity in winter is about half of that in summer at all the quartiles .",
    "the histograms show that the opacities of 0.04 and 0.10 are the opacities that occur most often in winter and summer , respectively .",
    "we then compared the opacity quartiles using our 3.5-year period statistics with those at the alma and the south pole sites , which are well - established sites for submm observations .",
    "the 225 ghz opacity data for the alma site have been obtained from @xcite and @xcite , whose measurements have been made between april 1995 and april 2006 ( @xmath28 years ) , and that for the south pole site from @xcite measured between january and december 1992 ( 1 year ) . since both the alma and the south pole sites are located in the southern hemisphere , we define winter as between the beginning of may through the end of october , and summer as november through april .",

    "we then calculated time durations of opacity conditions continuously lower than certain values .",
    "we focused on opacities lower than 0.05 , 0.04 , and 0.03 , which are excellent opacity conditions that only occur in @xmath35 of the winter season at the greenland summit camp .",
    "the resultant histograms for the greenland summit camp are presented in fig .",

    "for opacity less than 0.05 or 0.04 at the greenland summit camp , there were several occasions for which more than 100 hours were continuously showing opacities lower than those values , and there are many occasions that continued for more than 10 hours or several hours .",

    "this is obviously due to the polar conditions ( no diurnal variation ) as mentioned above , and it is very difficult to achieve similar values at other submillimeter sites that are not at polar regions , such as in the hawaii ( mauna kea ) or northern chile ( alma ) site .    indeed , we also calculated the time duration of opacity conditions for the alma site under the same opacity conditions as the greenland summit camp ( fig .",
    "[ fig - duration - hist]b ) , and the difference is obvious . at the alma site , there are many occasions for the opacity less than 0.05 , 0.04 , and even 0.03 continues for up to 20 hours , but the occasions for the duration longer than 20 hours are significantly smaller , about one - fifth , than the shorter durations . the duration longer than 100 hours has only been recorded for opacity lower than 0.05 , and never happened for opacities lower than 0.04 or 0.03 in the 11 yr long data .",

    "[ fig - duration - hist]c ) , the duration is obviously shorter than that of greenland summit camp .",
    "there are many occasions for the opacity less than 0.05 , which continues up to 10 hours , but there are significantly fewer occasions for the duration longer than 10 hours .",

    "table  [ tab - duration ] shows that low opacity conditions continue for more than 24 , 50 , 100 , 150 , and 200 hours at the greenland summit camp , alma , and the south pole .",
    "the alma and south pole sites have better atmospheric opacities over time durations longer than 24 hours and 50 hours at opacity conditions lower than 0.05 and 0.04 , respectively .",
    "but for time durations longer than 100 hours at opacity conditions lower than 0.04 , the greenland summit camp clearly has lower atmospheric opacities .",

    "the alma site always exhibits higher cumulative distributions than that of the greenland summit camp , and reaches 100% around several tens of hours .",
    "the south pole site shows the steepest cumulative distribution , and reaches 100% around a few tens of hours , much shorter than the other two sites .",

    "again , the south pole site is much shorter , only up to ten hours .    in summary , for the low opacity duration",

    "they found a median annual pwv of 0.94 mm over the summit of greenland .",
    "our radiometer - derived median pwv for the 3-year subset of our data from october 2011 to september 2014 is 1.28 mm . to connect these two periods",
    ", we note that the merra-2 median pwv for january 2008  december 2010 is 1.27 mm , whereas for october 2011 ",
    "september 2014 it is 1.16 mm .",
    "if we assume the merra-2 dry bias of approximately 10% is consistent between these periods , then the implied median pwv for 2008  2010 is 1.40 mm .",
    "this would suggest that the pwv for summit in @xcite is systematically lower than the actual pwv by approximately 33% .",
    "there are two reasons why a single satellite data set could produce significantly biased pwv statistics .",
    "first , although iasi is able to retrieve surface temperature , the water vapor retrieval accuracy in the lower troposphere necessarily suffers from a lack of thermal contrast with the surface @xcite .",
    "the second reason is temporal sampling bias .",
    "typically satellite sounders are in sun - synchronous orbits that pass over a given point on the earth s surface at the same pair of local times each day ; these are 9:30 and 21:30 in the case of iasi @xcite . in comparison",
    ", a reanalysis such as merra-2 can be expected to produce more realistic pwv statistics because it assimilates multiple satellite , surface , and upper air measurements using a model with realistic dynamics .",
    "we present the 3.5-yr monitoring of the 225 ghz opacity at the summit of the greenland ice sheet using a tipping radiometer .",
    "opacity variations clearly show a seasonal variation between winter ( @xmath62 nighttime ) and summer ( @xmath62 daytime ) , but no diurnal variation , with the opacity in winter being about half of that in summer .",
    "this is similar to the opacity variations at the south pole site due to the polar conditions , but the absolute opacity value is about 10%-30% higher than that of the south pole site in winter , and about double in summer . in contrast , the alma site shows clear seasonal and diurnal variations due to mid - latitude conditions ; the opacity at the alma site is up to 20% better than at the greenland site in winter , but up to 40% worse in summer .",
    "the estimated atmospheric transmission spectra suggest that most of the winter time is useable for astronomical observations at frequencies lower than 450 ghz , half of the time is useable for frequencies between 450 ghz and 1000 ghz , and 10% of the time is useable for the thz atmospheric windows .",
    "most of summer time is useable at frequencies lower than 380 ghz , and half of the summer time is useful at the 450 ghz atmospheric window .",
    "the linear correlations between 225 ghz and submillimeter atmospheric window opacities are derived , and opacities at the 492 ghz , 675 ghz , and 875 ghz windows are about 25  30 times larger , while those at thz windows are about @xmath40 times larger than the opacity at 225 ghz .",
    "these opacities are up to 25% higher than those at the alma site , which is due to the altitude difference between the greenland summit camp ( 3200 m ) and the alma site ( 5000 m ) .",
    "the biggest advantage of the opacity conditions at the greenland summit camp is the long time durations of low opacity . at the greenland summit camp ,",
    "opacities lower than 0.04 or 0.05 can continue for more than a hundred hours occasionally , and opacities lower than 0.03 can continue for more than several tens of hours in some cases . in case of opacity lower than 0.04 , the greenland summit camp is the only site that can continue this condition for more than one hundred hours , indicating that the greenland site is suitable for observations that need stable opacity conditions for a long time .",

    "we also would like to thank simon j. e. radford for providing us with the opacity data of the alma and the south pole sites .",

    "<S> we present the 3.5-yr monitoring results of 225 ghz opacity at the summit of the greenland ice sheet ( greenland summit camp ) at an altitude of 3200 m using a tipping radiometer . </S>",
    "<S> we chose this site as our submillimeter telescope ( greenland telescope ; glt ) site , because conditions are expected to have low submillimeter opacity and because its location offers favorable baselines to existing submillimeter telescopes for global - scale very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) . </S>",
    "<S> the site shows a clear seasonal variation with the average opacity lower by a factor of two during winter . </S>",
    "<S> the 25% , 50% , and 75% quartiles of the 225 ghz opacity during the winter months of november through april are 0.046 , 0.060 , and 0.080 , respectively . for the winter quartiles of 25% and 50% </S>",
    "<S> , the greenland site is about @xmath0 worse than the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) or the south pole sites . </S>",
    "<S> estimated atmospheric transmission spectra in winter season are similar to the alma site at lower frequencies ( @xmath1 ghz ) , which are transparent enough to perform astronomical observations almost all of the winter time with opacities @xmath2 , but @xmath3 higher opacities at higher frequencies ( @xmath4 ghz ) than those at the alma site . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the lower altitude of the greenland site and the resulting higher line wing opacity from pressure - broadened saturated water lines in addition to higher dry air continuum absorption at higher frequencies . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , half of the winter time at the greenland summit camp can be used for astronomical observations at frequencies between 450 ghz and 1000 ghz with opacities @xmath5 , and 10% of the time show @xmath6 transmittance in the thz ( 1035 ghz , 1350 ghz , and 1500 ghz ) windows . </S>",
    "<S> summer season is good for observations at frequencies lower than 380 ghz . </S>",
    "<S> one major advantage of the greenland summit camp site in winter is that there is no diurnal variation due to the polar night condition , and therefore the durations of low - opacity conditions are significantly longer than at the alma site . </S>",
    "<S> opacities lower than 0.05 or 0.04 can continue for more than 100 hours . </S>",
    "<S> such long stable opacity conditions do not occur as often even at the south pole ; it happens only for the opacity lower than 0.05 . </S>",
    "<S> since the opacity variation is directly related to the sky temperature ( background ) variation , the greenland summit camp is suitable for astronomical observations that need unusually stable sky background . </S>"
