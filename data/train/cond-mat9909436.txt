    "friction between solid surfaces is present in everyday life .",
    "one of the first experimental studies on friction was done by leonardo da vinci .",
    "his studies were rediscovered and announced by amonton de la hire in 1699 in the form of two laws : friction forces are a ) independent of the size of the surfaces in contact ; and , b ) proportional to the normal load .",
    "the proportionality coefficient @xmath2 is the friction coefficient , and depends on the material .",
    "the influence of velocity was later studied by coulomb , who discussed the difference between static and dynamic friction . since",
    "then many studies of friction have been conducted , which has revealed the complexity of friction related phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the study of friction has been the subject of renewed interest lately due to its relevance in the behavior of granular materials  @xcite .",
    "due to surface roughness , the interface between two solids put in contact can be thought to consist of many points , rather than a continuous region  @xcite .",
    "these contact points define a two - dimensional random set called `` multicontact interface '' .",
    "a basic setup for experiments on multicontact interfaces consists of a slider of mass @xmath9 pulled by a spring with effective stiffness @xmath10 ( that could represent the bulk elasticity of the solid ) , at a driving velocity @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "depending on the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath9 , the sliding motion can have different regimes , including an oscillating `` stick - slip '' instability .",
    "moreover , the friction coefficient is found to depend not only on these three parameters but also on a variety of other factors such as contact stiffness , creep aging and velocity weakening of the contacts , that lead to a dependence not only on the instantaneous - velocity but also on the sliding history  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the friction force seems to be both state- and rate - dependent .",
    "a phenomenological derivation of the friction force that reproduces some aspects of the experimental data was proposed by caroli and velicky  @xcite .    here , we focus on the random character of the multicontact interface , and",
    "show that a simple model whose only ingredient is a randomly varying friction coefficient can explain recent experimental findings .",
    "we consider in particular the dynamics of a sliding block on an inclined plane .",
    "this problem has been recently revisited by brito and gomes ( bg )  @xcite , who report unexpected results . in their experimental setup ,",
    "a block rests on a plane which makes an angle @xmath3 with the horizontal , where @xmath3 is close to but smaller than @xmath13 , the critical angle for dynamic friction .",
    "the block is set in motion by the impact of a hammer at the base of the inclined plane .",
    "a `` sliding '' is so produced , and the block stops after traversing a distance @xmath1 .",
    "measuring the distribution @xmath14 of slidings with length larger than @xmath1 , these authors find that , for @xmath3 close to @xmath13 , @xmath15 .",
    "the exponent @xmath16 is @xmath17 and does not seem to depend on the type of material that makes the block .",
    "further exponents can be in principle defined , such as the one describing the divergence of the mean sliding length @xmath18 as @xmath6 .",
    "brito and gomes report @xmath19  @xcite .    in this work",
    "we introduce a model that uses a simple expression  @xcite for the friction force and provides a microscopic explanation for most of the findings of brito and gomes .",
    "we assume that friction is due to the existence of random contact points between the surfaces , therefore the friction coefficient is a rapidly varying function @xmath20 of the block position @xmath21 on the plane .",
    "a fundamental hypothesis , which makes this model exactly solvable , is that the distribution of contact points is _ uncorrelated _ on the length - scales of interest .",
    "we focus here on the simplest realization of the model , where no other features such as velocity - dependent forces are included .",
    "this model has been studied numerically previously  @xcite .",
    "we show here that a closed analytical solution can be obtained by mapping this problem onto a first - passage - time problem .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section [ sec : model ] our model is described and some numerical results are presented . in section [ sec : theory ] it is shown that this system is equivalent to a random walk with an absorbing barrier , and an exact solution is derived for the distribution of slidings . also in this section a comparison is made between numerical , analytical and experimental results .",
    "section [ sec : conclusions ] contains a short discussion of our results .",
    "consider a block of mass @xmath22 on a plane making an angle @xmath3 with the horizontal , and assume that at time @xmath23 the block is set in motion with velocity @xmath24 , i.e. with kinetic energy @xmath25 .",
    "let @xmath21 be the distance traversed by the block from its starting position , measured along the plane , and @xmath26 its kinetic energy .",
    "since the friction force opposing the movement is @xmath27 , and the parallel component of the gravitational force is @xmath28 ( see fig .  [ fig:1 ] ) , energy balance implies @xmath29 we rewrite this in terms of the reduced kinetic energy @xmath30 as @xmath31 this equation can be integrated until the kinetic energy becomes zero .",
    "this defines the `` avalanche size '' , or stopping distance @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath32 independent of @xmath21 , one has that .",
    "this does not in general agree with experimental results @xcite , which show a broad distribution of stopping distances .",
    "one could argue that in the experiments of bg , @xmath24 is randomly distributed and thus @xmath1 must show a distribution with a finite width as well .",
    "but this sort of randomness can not give rise to a power - law distribution of stopping distances as observed in experiments , unless @xmath24 itself is power - law distributed , which does nt seem to be easily justified .    because of the random character of the multicontact interface , it is on the other hand physically reasonable to assume that the coefficient of friction is not constant but changes randomly from point to point . in this case",
    "the stopping length @xmath1 becomes a stochastic variable , and we are interested here in calculating the probability @xmath0 for the block to stop at a given position @xmath1 .",
    "we will show that under certain circumstances ( e.g. close to the critical angle ) , fluctuations in the friction coefficient can have important observable consequences , and in particular that such fluctuations give rise to a power - law distribution of stopping distances .    for simplicity",
    "we assume @xmath20 to be an uncorrelated random function of position , i.e. @xmath33 so that ( [ eq : redk ] ) now reads @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the mean drift , and @xmath36 is a noise term . if the mean drift @xmath37 is positive , clearly there will be a finite probability for the block never to stop .",
    "for @xmath38 on the other hand the block always stops .",
    "this problem can be easily implemented numerically  @xcite . in our numerical implementation both the block and the plane surfaces",
    "are represented by finite sequences of 0s and 1s , each bit corresponding to a small region of length @xmath39 .",
    "if a given region of the surface is `` prominent '' , the corresponding bit is set to one .",
    "similarly if that region is `` deep '' , the corresponding bit is set to 0 .",
    "thus the profile of these surfaces is represented by strings of bits which are set to one with probability @xmath40 and @xmath41 for the plane and block respectively .",
    "one says that the block and plane are in contact at a given point whenever both the plane bit and the block bit that sits on top of it are set to one .",
    "assuming that the friction coefficient is proportional to the number of `` regions '' in contact , @xmath20 at position @xmath21 takes the value @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the number of microcontacts , @xmath44 is the block length in bits and @xmath45 is a constant that can be associated to the contact stiffness .",
    "equation ( [ eq : mu ] ) is similar to the one proposed by bowden and tabor  @xcite .",
    "the dynamic evolution dictated by equation ( [ eq : redk ] ) can be discretized and , after each displacement of length @xmath39 ( one bit ) , the kinetic energy loss is calculated as @xmath46 the block is moved on the plane in single - bit steps until the kinetic energy vanishes .",
    "the critical angle @xmath13 is defined by taking @xmath47 in ( [ eq : deltae ] ) and gives @xmath48    in the limit in which the average sliding is much larger than the block size in bits , ( i.e. if @xmath24 is large , or @xmath3 is close to @xmath13 ) one does not expect any dependence of the results on the length @xmath44 of the block , as long as the distribution of the friction coefficient @xmath2 has a constant mean and width . in this case",
    "it is numerically convenient to take a block length of one bit ( which is always set to one ) .",
    "the plane bits on the other hand are set to one with probability @xmath41 .",
    "in this case @xmath2 takes the values @xmath49 and @xmath45 with probabilities @xmath50 and @xmath40 respectively , so that @xmath51 . fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] shows our numerical results for this single - bit implementation .",
    "we have used @xmath52 and @xmath53 , i.e. @xmath54 , therefore @xmath55 .",
    "the initial reduced kinetic energy was @xmath56 ( @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) .",
    "averages were performed over @xmath59 realizations for each value of @xmath3 . when @xmath60 we find that @xmath8 , for @xmath1 smaller than a @xmath3-dependent cutoff @xmath61 .",
    "this behavior is in partial agreement with the experimental results of bg  @xcite .",
    "while the exponent they find is consistent with @xmath62 , they do not report any evidence for the existence of a finite cutoff . according to our results ,",
    "a very large number of experimental realizations would be needed before a cutoff can be clearly distinguished in @xmath0 . as can be seen by integrating the data in fig .",
    "2 , for deviations from the critical angle as large as @xmath63 , @xmath0 only deviates from a power - law behavior for very large events , which have a small probability @xmath64 to happen .",
    "this means that one needs of order @xmath65 realizations in order to assess the existence of a cutoff in @xmath0 .",
    "notice however that bg only performed @xmath66 repetitions of their measurements for each set of parameters , and this explains why only the power - law regime is observed in their experiments .",
    "[ fig:3 ] displays the mean stopping length @xmath5 and the `` cutoff '' @xmath67 versus @xmath68 , calculated from the data in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] .",
    "when @xmath69 ( @xmath70 ) we find that @xmath71 and @xmath72 approximate well our numerical results .",
    "this is in slight discrepancy with bg who report that @xmath73  @xcite .",
    "since @xmath74 satisfies equation  ( [ eq : redk ] ) the problem of finding @xmath0 is readily mapped onto a first - passage - time ( fpt ) problem for a random walker with nonzero drift .",
    "the reduced kinetic energy @xmath74 ( which is the `` position '' variable @xmath75 of the random walker ) , starts at @xmath76 , and executes a random walk with mean drift @xmath35 . in this picture",
    "@xmath21 has the meaning of a `` time '' variable , and we say that the sliding - block has stopped at time @xmath77 if its kinetic energy becomes zero at position @xmath78 . thus the distribution of stopping distances @xmath0 is the distribution of first - passage - times for a random walker to cross @xmath79 .",
    "this problem turns out to be exactly equivalent to the `` gambler s ruin '' problem  @xcite , in which one asks for the probability for a gambler with an initial capital @xmath80 not to have reached its ruin in @xmath1 games if it makes an average win @xmath37 in each run .",
    "[ fig:4 ] shows a schematic representation of the equivalent fpt problem .",
    "equivalently one can ask for the distribution probability @xmath81 for a random walker to be at position @xmath75 at time @xmath82 , when there is an absorbing barrier at @xmath79 .",
    "the `` flux '' of particles at @xmath79 gives then the desired distribution of first - passage - times @xmath83 . because of these mappings",
    ", the sliding - block problem with uncorrelated random friction turns out to be completely equivalent to compact directed percolation with an absorbing wall  @xcite(cdpw - see also  @xcite ) , which is exactly solvable , and analogous to directed percolation with an absorbing wall ( dpw )  @xcite , which has not yet been solved analytically .",
    "although this classical random - walk problem has been solved in many different contexts  ( e.g. @xcite ) , an exact solution is briefly derived here for self - containedness .",
    "let @xmath81 be the probability for the block to have reduced kinetic energy @xmath84 after traversing a distance @xmath85 . since @xmath74 satisfies the stochastic equation ( [ eq : redk ] ) ,",
    "@xmath81 is a solution of the fokker - planck equation  @xcite @xmath86 where @xmath87 . since the particle stops , i.e.",
    ", it is eliminated from the system , when its kinetic energy becomes zero , one has to solve ( [ eq : fp ] ) with absorbing boundary condition at @xmath79 @xmath88 the initial condition is @xmath89 if the block starts with a well defined energy @xmath80 .",
    "the green function of ( [ eq : fp ] ) is @xmath90 in terms of which the solution of ( [ eq : fp ] ) plus ( [ eq : bc ] ) is@xcite @xmath91 the probability @xmath92 for the block not to have stopped ( the random walker not to have been absorbed ) at time @xmath82 is @xmath93 and thus the probability @xmath83 to be absorbed at time @xmath82 is @xmath94 now using the fact that @xmath81 satisfies the fokker - planck equation ( [ eq : fp ] ) , it is readily shown that @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the conserved _ flux _",
    "@xmath97 so that finally @xmath98 in fig .  [ fig:7 ] we compare this exact solution with our numerical measurements for the single - bit model . for a rw with step length @xmath99 is readily found that @xmath100 .",
    "we set @xmath101 ( @xmath102 and @xmath103 ) .",
    "the agreement between analytical and numerical results is very good .",
    "[ fig:5 ] shows @xmath83 from equation ( [ eq : pedete ] ) for several values of @xmath37 which are taken to be powers of @xmath104 for convenience .",
    "notice that for @xmath38 the area under @xmath83 is constant and equal to one , meaning that the block always stops . for positive @xmath37 on the other hand , this area is less than one , meaning that there is a finite ( @xmath37-dependent ) probability for the block never to stop , i.e. to `` escape '' to infinity .",
    "exactly at the critical angle ( i.e. for @xmath105 ) one obtains @xmath106 for large times ( @xmath107 ) this gives @xmath108 which is consistent with our numerical measurements .    * a ) * 0.5 cm * b ) *    the escape probability @xmath109 is plotted in fig .  [ fig:6 ] as a function of @xmath37 .",
    "this probability is small if @xmath37 is small , thus there is a continuous phase transition at @xmath110 . as customary  @xcite , for @xmath111 we write @xmath112 which defines the critical exponent @xmath113 . for finite times",
    ", @xmath114 measures the probability for the particle to be `` alive '' .",
    "usual scaling arguments allow one to write , for @xmath82 large and @xmath115 , @xmath116 with @xmath117 a correlation time diverging at @xmath110 as @xmath118 .",
    "the scaling function @xmath119 satisfies @xmath120 when @xmath121 , thus when @xmath105 one has that @xmath122 , i.e. the power - law decay of correlations that is typical of a critical point .",
    "now it is easy to calculate @xmath113 and @xmath123 . since @xmath124 one has that at @xmath105 @xmath83 behaves as @xmath125 .",
    "therefore equation ( [ eq : critical ] ) , implies @xmath126 , in agreement with bg experimental results @xcite .",
    "the `` cutoff '' time @xmath67 for finite but small @xmath37 results from the condition that the argument of the exponential in ( [ eq : pedete ] ) be larger than one . thus solving @xmath127",
    "one obtains @xmath128 i.e. @xmath129 . therefore @xmath130 .",
    "this last value can be confirmed using ( [ eq : pinf ] ) , since @xmath131 which for small @xmath37 gives @xmath132 since the integral gives a constant value in this limit .",
    "the third independent exponent , and the last one needed to fully characterize the critical behavior in dp is the `` meandering exponent '' @xmath133 defined by @xmath134 with @xmath135 and @xmath136 associated to the divergence of `` space '' correlations @xmath137 . for a random walk",
    "we have @xmath138 and thus @xmath139 implying @xmath140 .    from the values of these exponents one can conclude that for @xmath141 the mean stopping time @xmath5 behaves as @xmath142 with  @xcite @xmath143 .",
    "this again is in good agreement with our numerical measurements .",
    "this work shows that most of the experimental results obtained by brito & gomes for sliding blocks on a chute  @xcite can be reproduced by a very simple model .",
    "compared with the traditional problem of a block sliding on a chute , a random friction coefficient is the only new ingredient in our study . the problem of finding the distribution of stopping lengths is equivalent to a first - passage - time random walk problem for an uncorrelated random walker with zero drift , and thus exact analytical solution .",
    "we derive this solution and compare its predictions with numerical results , obtaining a perfect agreement . at the critical angle @xmath144 , a power - law distribution of stopping distances",
    "is obtained : @xmath145 in good agreement with experimental findings . however , a discrepancy arises for the mean sliding length @xmath5 , which is in this work found to behave as @xmath146 , while bg report @xmath147 .",
    "we believe that this difference is due to uncontrolled experimental errors , mainly because of the difficulty involved in the measurement of @xmath148 ( and thus @xmath13 ) on real systems .",
