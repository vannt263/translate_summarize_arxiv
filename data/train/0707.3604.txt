    "studies of detached , double - lined eclipsing binary systems ( debs ) allow for direct measurements of the masses and radii of stars .",
    "these measurements have direct implications for theories of stellar structure and evolution .",
    "our understanding of the structure of stars on the lower main sequence has improved over the past decade , but relatively few direct measurements of stellar mass and radius exist for objects with masses @xmath7 .",
    "measurements of stars in this mass range allow us to test models of stellar structure where they are least well constrained by observation .",
    "there are four known main sequence debs inhabiting this mass range and the properties of these systems are well - measured ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in order to refine physical models of low - mass stars , more systems must be discovered and studied .",
    "large - area synoptic surveys offer the best hope for the identification of new low - mass eclipsing systems .",
    "the photometric databases of shallow , wide - angle , surveys such as those aimed at the discovery of grb afterglows or transiting planets , are already being combed for the most interesting binary systems @xcite , but the number of m dwarfs in these shallow surveys is limited .",
    "these surveys have also been used to identify low - mass single - lined systems from which the mass and radius of an unseen companion can be inferred @xcite .    the advent of deeper surveys with sparser time sampling ( less than one observation per day ) , such as pan - starrs @xcite and lsst @xcite , will become a vital resource for studies of variable objects of all types . since low - mass stars are intrinsically faint , deep surveys may prove particularly powerful for studies of these objects .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and its follow - up survey sdss - ii are excellent prototypes of the types of data that these future surveys will produce . here , we report the first results from a program to identify debs in sdss - ii observations of an area of the sky scanned repeatedly as part of the sdss supernova survey program .",
    "we present the discovery of a new deb along with mass and radius measurements of these two low - mass stars based on spectra taken with keck / lris and near infrared ( nir ) photometry gathered with the robotic telescope pairitel .",
    "this discovery helps to fill in a poorly sampled portion of the mass - radius relation for low - mass stars . in section 2 , we describe the identification of this deb and the follow - up observations . in section 3",
    ", we describe our analysis , modeling , and the derivation of the physical parameters of the system . in sections 4 and 5",
    "we discuss our results in the context of the known low - mass eclipsing binary systems and future prospects for the discovery of similar systems .",
    "the sdss - ii supernova survey @xcite repeatedly observes about 300 deg@xmath8 of sky centered around the celestial equator . the raw data ,",
    "both imaging and uncalibrated outputs from the photometric pipeline , are made publicly available through the sdss sn archive server .",
    "we downloaded all of the imaging data from @xmath9 band and the corresponding pipeline outputs available as of april , 2006 . in total , nearly @xmath10 individual 2048 by 1489 pixel images from 70 observing runs were available .",
    "we calibrated the uncalibrated outputs of the photometric pipeline against stars from the sdss dr4 @xcite photometric catalog .",
    "this was done by matching the pixel coordinates of stars in the raw @xmath9-band images to the coordinates of preselected catalog f - g - k stars and calculating a simple photometric solution for each individual image using raw @xmath11 magnitudes ( no color terms ) .",
    "once the positions of stars in the raw @xmath9-band images were matched to the photometric pipeline outputs , a similar photometric solution was calculated in the @xmath12 and @xmath13-bands .",
    "recent work by @xcite and @xcite presents more sophisticated methods for calibrating repeat observations in sdss .",
    "we found our technique to produce individual light curves with rms of between 0.03 and 0.05 mag ( @xmath1419.0 ) , adequate precision for the detection of large eclipse signals .",
    "we preselected a set of 19,000 m dwarf targets from the photometric database of sdss dr4 .",
    "this was done following m dwarf colors presented by @xcite and requiring that objects have flags corresponding to high photometric quality .",
    "our targets all have @xmath15 and @xmath16 , corresponding roughly to a sample of objects of spectral types m4 and later with @xmath17 band photometric precision better than @xmath18 .",
    "faint objects with colors of @xmath19 are expected to be almost exclusively m dwarfs since other types of point sources , such as quasars and m giants , are very rare in this portion of the color - magnitude diagram @xcite .",
    "we generated @xmath20 light curves for all of these objects , each light curve consisting of between 10 and 30 observations in each band .",
    "we identified potential eclipsing sources by searching for objects that exhibited decreases in brightness of more than 0.20 mag which were found to occur simultaneously in all three bands .",
    "this conservative requirement for the large amplitude of the dimming and the requirement that it be found in all three bands resulted in a robust method for identifying eclipsing candidates .",
    "since we have relatively few observations of each target , we require a conservative detection threshold to ensure a very low rate of false positives . our analysis produced a list of 13 candidates that have been observed as part of an ongoing program to identify debs in sdss - ii .",
    "of these candidates , sdss031824 - 010018 was the most promising .",
    "the sdss - ii light curve of this object , which we call sdss - meb-1 , contained 15 points in @xmath21 and @xmath13 and displayed two epochs with fluxes that were lower than the mean flux by @xmath22 mag in each band .",
    "an expanded sdss - ii light curve , containing additional data , is shown in figure [ figa ] .",
    "the basic observed parameters of sdss - meb-1 are given in table 1 .",
    "we observed sdss - meb-1 with the pairitel robotic nir observatory between 9 september , 2006 and 8 october , 2006 .",
    "observations consisted of 30 to 60 minutes of individual 7.8s integrations on each clear night .",
    "the pairitel camera takes images in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 bands simultaneously .",
    "the pairitel imager was originally used for the southern portion of the 2mass survey @xcite .",
    "the observations were automatically scheduled , collected , and reduced with the fully robotic observing system described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the images were gathered using a randomized dither pattern and individual integrations were combined into mosaics with total integration time of @xmath26300s using _ swarp _ @xcite .",
    "we produced differential aperture photometry relative to a set of comparison stars from the 2mass catalog and photometric errors were estimated based on read noise and photon noise .",
    "our analysis resulted in 937 individual measurements in @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 bands .",
    "we report the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 measurements in table 2 .",
    "we observed sdss - meb-1 spectroscopically using the lris @xcite instrument on keck on 20 september 2006 and 21 november 2006 .",
    "spectra were taken at resolutions r@xmath27 and r@xmath28 using the @xmath29 grooves mm@xmath30 , 8500   blaze and @xmath31 grooves mm@xmath30 , 7500   blaze gratings with a 1@xmath32 slit .",
    "these two setups cover the spectral ranges 5550 - 9270   and 6335 - 7600   , respectively .",
    "we observed the standard star hd 19445 for flux calibration .",
    "we extracted the red channel spectra following the optimal extraction method outlined by @xcite .",
    "we did not observe any radial velocity standards , so wavelength solutions were determined using both hgnear comparison lamps and isolated night sky emission lines from the catalog of @xcite .",
    "all spectra showed prominent emission due to @xmath33 and the @xmath34 spectra revealed two distinct emission lines .",
    "the detection of h@xmath35 emission demonstrates that the stars have chromospheric activity . the percentage of low - mass stars that are found to be active peaks at spectral type m5 , where up to @xmath36 of stars may show @xmath33 emission @xcite .",
    "we also obtained high - resolution imaging of the field around sdss - meb-1 on 15 october , 2006 using the scam camera on keck / nirspec . in @xmath37 seeing we find no companions between 1@xmath32 and @xmath38 down to an approximate limiting magnitude of @xmath39=18.5 .",
    "an initial inspection of the pairitel photometry revealed large changes in the observed brightness of this system , a clear signature of an eclipsing binary .",
    "we estimated the period of the system using the phase dispersion minimization method of @xcite in two stages .",
    "a first pass using coarse resolution in trial frequency indicated a prominent peak in the periodogram at around 0.4d with lesser peaks at double and half this period .",
    "we re - calculated a periodogram around @xmath40d using a fine spacing in trial frequency of 2.5 day@xmath30 .",
    "we fit a parabola to the peak in this high - resolution periodogram to estimate the period of the system and found @xmath0=0.407037@xmath41d .",
    "we determined a precise time of zero phase with a parabolic fit to the center of the primary eclipse in the folded light curve and estimated the epoch of primary eclipse to be @xmath42 ( hjd ) .",
    "we determined the radial velocities of both components of the binary by modeling the two @xmath33 emission lines seen in the @xmath34 spectra .",
    "for both the @xmath34 and @xmath43 spectra we began by fitting gaussian profiles to isolated emission lines in comparison lamp spectra in order to determine the width of the instrumental profile .",
    "we found that the individual @xmath33 emission lines in the spectra of sdss - meb-1 were resolved in the @xmath34 spectra so the gaussian profiles were broadened to fit the data .",
    "we assume the same width for each of the @xmath33 emission lines .",
    "two of our @xmath34 spectra were acquired when the velocity separation between the two stars was close to maximal . in these spectra ,",
    "the two emission lines are individually resolved and well separated and we fit a model of two super - imposed gaussians to a @xmath44 portion of the spectra around @xmath33 .",
    "this model has five parameters : one for the centers of each gaussian , one for the width of both gaussians , one for their relative heights , and one for overall flux scaling .",
    "we used @xmath45 minimization to fit for these parameters in the spectra taken near phase 0.25 .",
    "a spectrum of sdss - meb-1 around the region of the two emission lines , along with the best - fit model , is shown in figure [ figb ] .",
    "we used the fits to these well - separated lines to fix the relative heights of the emission lines and their widths .",
    "the two emission lines are partially or totally blended in the rest of our data , particularly in the @xmath43 spectra where they are both unresolved and blended . for the remaining @xmath34 spectra we used the fixed widths and relative heights determined previously to fit for the velocities of the two components .",
    "for the @xmath43 spectra we used the relative heights determined previously and widths corresponding to the instrumental profile determined from fits to emission lines in comparison lamp spectra .",
    "we derived errors on the radial velocity estimates of each component in each spectrum based on the formal errors of the @xmath45 fit added in quadrature to the error estimate for the wavelength solution .",
    "all of the radial velocities are corrected to the solar system barycenter using a the iraf routine _",
    "bcvcorr_. our radial - velocity measurements are presented in table 3 along with the estimated radial velocity curve parameters in table 4 .    while the uncertainty on our individual radial velocity measurements , particularly those from the @xmath43 spectra , are large , the radial velocities align very well with the epoch and period determined from the photometry alone . in order to estimate the system orbital parameters and the masses of each component we fixed the period and epoch of primary eclipse , assumed an eccentricity of @xmath46 , and",
    "fit a three parameter model to the radial velocity data .",
    "we estimated the two radial velocity amplitudes , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , and the systemic velocity , @xmath49 with a @xmath45 minimization . assuming a keplerian orbit with no eccentricity , the parameters of the radial velocity orbit translate easily into estimates for @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "we estimated the errors on each of these values through a bootstrap simulation .",
    "we follow the convention that the primary star is the one eclipsed at phase 0 , which is also the more massive star .",
    "this results in the marginally deeper eclipse depth seen at phase 0 .",
    "the radial - velocity measurements , along with the best - fit model , are shown in figure [ figd ] .",
    "close inspection of the spectra resulting in two discrepant ( off by @xmath53 from the model ) measurements from ut nov 21 ( near phase 0.45 ) indicated that the measurements were likely biased by the superposition of a sky emission line on the shoulder of the marginally - blended h@xmath35 lines .",
    "in addition , some of our radial - velocity observations occur very close the time of primary eclipse .",
    "assuming a rotation period locked to the orbital period of the system , we estimate that the amplitude of the rossiter - mclaughlin effect is small comparable to our radial - velocity precision .    in order to increase the power of light curve modeling , and to break a partial degeneracy that exists in the determination of the ratio of the two stellar radii for systems with comparable eclipse depths or partial",
    "eclipses , we estimated the light ratio from our @xmath34 spectra .",
    "we fit spectra taken near phase 0.0 , when the component velocities are perpendicular to our line of sight , to template m dwarf spectra made available by @xcite .",
    "we found good agreement between our spectra and the active m4 dwarf template spectra . in figure [ figc ]",
    "we show the spectrum of sdss - meb-1 compared to the template of @xcite .",
    "we solved for the light ratio by fitting spectra taken at other phases to the sum of two active m4 dwarf template spectra doppler shifted relative to each other and each scaled by a different multiplicative factor .",
    "the doppler shifts of the two template spectra were fixed to values defined by the fit to the radial velocity curve .",
    "we calculated a @xmath45 goodness - of - fit between the model comprised of the weighted sum of the templates and our spectra for a range of relative brightnesses between 0.5 and 2.0 . during the fitting , the area around the @xmath33 emission lines",
    "was given no weight .",
    "a fit to the region around the minimum of the resulting @xmath45 surface yielded a light ratio estimate of @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite presents theoretical evolutionary models of low - mass stars , the predictions of which we can compare to this estimate of the light ratio .",
    "the spectra used in our analysis span the wavelength range @xmath55 to @xmath56 , comparable to the @xmath57 band . at an age of 2 gyr and [ m / h]=0.0",
    ", @xcite predicts a light ratio of 0.744 ( 0.740 at t=5gyr ) in the cousins / bessel @xmath57 band for the stellar masses determined from the fit to the radial velocity curve .",
    "based on the reasonable agreement between our light ratio estimate and the value predicted from theory , we adopt the nir light ratio estimates of @xcite throughout our modeling of the light curves .",
    "we estimated the error on this light - ratio estimate using a monte - carlo simulation by varying the masses ( assuming @xmath58 ) of the two components of the binary within their errors .",
    "we estimated an uncertainty of @xmath59 in our light ratio estimate and do not include a systematic contribution due to any biases that may be inherent to the @xcite models themselves .",
    "we modeled our nir light curves using the ebop @xcite technique as implemented in the code _ jktebop _ by j. southworth @xcite . here , we fixed the mass ratio , period , eccentricity , epoch , and the brightness ratio @xmath60 and fit for the sum of the radii of the stars in terms of the orbital separation , @xmath61 , the ratio of the radii of the stars , the inclination angle @xmath9 , and the ratio of the central surfaces brightnesses , @xmath62 .",
    "we fixed the gravity darkening exponent to 0.32 as appropriate for a convective star @xcite and calculated the reflection coefficients from bolometric theory .",
    "we used logarithmic limb darkening coefficients for a @xmath63=3200k , @xmath64 star from @xcite for nir passbands .",
    "the _ jktebop _ implementation of ebop allows for the estimation of errors on the parameters using monte - carlo simulations .",
    "based on the quality and quantity of the photometric data collected with pairitel , as well as the long time baseline of the observations , we did not attempt to model spots on the components of the sdss - meb-1 system . based on the ebop models of the system , the out - of - eclipse variations are expected to be very small compared to the photometric errors .",
    "this allows us to evaluate the validity of our estimated photometric errors .",
    "we scaled our photometric error estimates until the reduced @xmath65 of the data at phase @xmath66 , assuming constant brightness , was 1.0 .",
    "we derived the errors on our estimated parameters from @xmath67 bootstrapping simulations and include our estimate of the uncertainty on the orbital separation @xmath68 .",
    "we found other sources of error from fixed parameters , such as the mass ratio and the limb darkening model , to be negligible .",
    "we fit the @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 band light curves with consistent results .",
    "the photometric errors on our @xmath25 photometry are large ( @xmath72 ) compared to the eclipse depth and so the constraints on the system parameters from this band are relatively poor .",
    "we derived final values for the light curve parameters in two stages .",
    "first , the geometric ( @xmath9 , @xmath73 , @xmath74 ) parameters were determined from weighted average of those from the @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 observations . with these geometric parameters fixed , we ran the ebop analysis a second time to better determine the radiative parameters ( central surface brightness ratio @xmath62 and total light ratio @xmath60 ) . the model fit to our @xmath23-band data is shown in figures [ fige ] and [ figf ] and the parameters from our ebop analysis are shown in table 5 .",
    "the physical parameters of the sdss - meb-1 system derived from the radial velocity and photometric analyses are given in table 6 .",
    "we estimate the ratio of the radius of each component to the radius of its roche lobe to be 0.389 and 0.367 for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "we estimated the effective temperatures ( @xmath63 ) of each component of sdss - meb-1 by combining the results of the ebop analysis with the barnes - evans color - surface brightness relation .",
    "the ebop analysis of the nir light curves provides @xmath62 , the ratio of the central surface brightnesses of the two stars . from the work of @xcite",
    "we can relate the ratio of the average surface brightnesses of the two stars to the ratio of their @xmath75 colors .",
    "since the temperatures of the two stars are expected to be similar , our assumption of the same limb darkening model for each star allows us to assume that the ratio of the central surface brightnesses is the same as the ratio of the average surface brightnesses . following the color - temperature relations of @xcite we convert nir colors into temperatures .",
    "these relations are used to both turn the color ratio determined from the barnes - evans relation into a temperature ratio and to estimate the average temperature of the system . from the combined color of the sdss - meb-1 , we estimate the luminosity - weighted average temperature of the system . converting the denis @xmath76 to a cousins @xmath77 following @xcite and the 2mass @xmath25 and @xmath23 to @xmath78 and @xmath79 following @xcite we estimate the luminosity - weighted average temperature of the sdss - meb-1 system to be @xmath80 .",
    "the temperature ratio estimate and the estimate of the average temperature of the system comprise a system two equations in two unknowns , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , which we solve numerically to arrive at the @xmath63 estimates given in table 6 .",
    "the errors on the temperature estimates are derived from monte carlo simulations in which the errors from each of the colors and color transformations are propagated .",
    "we find that the temperatures of the two stars are consistent within the large errors and that the values agree well with the estimated temperatures for the components of the system cm draconis , which have similar masses @xcite .",
    "we combine the results of the light - curve and radial - velocity analyses to produce the physical parameters of the system listed in table 6 .",
    "the components of sdss - meb-1 fall in a mass regime were there are currently few direct mass and radius measurements from debs .",
    "our measurements are in good agreement with the empirical mass - radius relation of @xcite as well as the theoretical models ( @xmath838.0 , 9.0 ; [ m / h]=0 ) of @xcite .",
    "recent work by @xcite has explored the importance of rotation and magnetic activity in the evolution of low - mass stars in binaries . since both components of sdss - meb-1 show h@xmath35 emission , demonstrating magnetic activity , a more precise set of system parameters could place important constraints on these new models .",
    "our two new mass and radius measurements , along with models and other low - mass stars from the literature , are shown in figure [ figg ] .",
    "if our system were very young then our radius estimates would would fall about @xmath84 below the 0.1 gyr relation of @xcite .",
    "while sdss - meb-1 does lie in the vicinity of orion , it is located more than @xmath85 from known star - forming regions .",
    "we also compare the @xmath86 and @xmath63 estimates from sdss - meb-1 to models from @xcite . in figure [ figh ]",
    "we compare the two components of sdss - meb-1 to isochrones and mass - tracks . using the solar metallicity models",
    ", we find a best - fit age for the system of @xmath87 .",
    "we find good agreement between the mass - tracks and isochrones from the @xcite models .",

    "is @xmath88 .",
    "based on comparison of the observed @xmath23-@xmath39 colors of sdss - meb-1 to the same isochrones , we estimate a @xmath69band modulus and a distance of the system of @xmath89 pc . at the position of sdss - meb-1 relative to the galactic disk",
    ", we expect a significant portion of the total estimated reddening along the line of sight . since the average color of the system is an important factor in the determination of the individual temperatures , for @xmath90 we will underestimate the temperatures of the components of sdss - meb-1 .",
    "we estimate that for each 0.1 mag increase in @xmath91 our estimated temperatures of the stars decreases by @xmath92k .    with current data we lack sufficient precision to identify shortcomings in the models of low - mass stars .",
    "increasing the total number of known low - mass deb systems across a wide range of masses will improve our understanding of these objects .",
    "deep , large - area surveys with sparse time sampling represent an excellent resource for the identification of new low - mass eclipsing systems .",
    "we have demonstrated that even as few as 15 high - quality , multi - color observations can be useful for identifying important new objects . while the amplitude of the eclipse signal is large enough to reliably identify promising candidates with synoptic surveys , objects discovered in this way present unique difficulties in terms of follow - up observations .",
    "the sparse sampling of the discovery light curves requires a significant investment of observing time to generate a complete light curve . focusing on relatively faint targets with good photometric precision results in a vast increase in the total number of targets ,",
    "particularly m dwarfs , and affords an increase in the number of viable targets for searching for eclipsing binaries and transiting planets . at the same time , the spectroscopic and photometric followup becomes more problematic and more expensive as the candidates become fainter .",
    "the study of eclipsing systems with future synoptic surveys will require a shift in emphasis from discovery to follow - up observations .",
    "robotic observing systems , such as pairitel , are ideally suited for this type or work and will become an integral part of transient science produced by future synoptic surveys .",
    "the discovery of sdss - meb-1 highlights the potential importance of the sdss - ii , and future synoptic data sets , for studies of eclipsing systems .",
    "the sdss - ii data are qualitatively different from the data sets typically used to search for low - mass eclipsing systems .",
    "current planetary transit surveys tend to produce high - quality , high - cadence photometry for a relatively small number of targets .",
    "future synoptic surveys will acquire fewer observations per target , with comparatively worse precision , but will observe orders of magnitude more targets .",
    "we attempt to quantify the potential impact of sdss - ii on studies of low - mass stars by estimating the number of deb systems that are likely to be present in the sdss - ii data .",
    "we used the @xmath93 to @xmath9-band absolute magnitude relations from @xcite and color relations of @xcite to estimate the absolute magnitudes of all of the point sources with @xmath94 contained in the sdss - ii repeat scan region .",
    "these absolute magnitudes were first converted to bessel magnitudes and then to mass estimates following the solar - age , solar - metallicity isochrones of @xcite .",
    "our estimate includes stars with mass @xmath95 .",
    "we assume a total binary fraction of @xmath96 @xcite and integrate the mass - ratio distribution and semi - major axis distribution of @xcite in order to estimate the total number of binaries in our survey and the distribution of their parameters .",
    "we place several constraints on these binaries to estimate the number of systems that could be identified in the sdss - ii data and confirmed with follow - up observations .",
    "since radial velocity observations are crucial for obtaining masses and radii of these stars , we constrain our targets to be brighter than @xmath97 with both components exhibiting radial - velocity semi - amplitudes of at least 30 km s@xmath30 . in order to ensure that the system is double - lined",
    ", we also require that the ratio of the luminosities of the components is no less than 0.1 .",
    "we require that the system be in eclipse for more than @xmath98 of the time , so that the expected number of points in eclipse is @xmath99 with sdss - ii , and that the amplitude of the eclipse is @xmath100 .",
    "we estimate the total number of stars in systems meeting these criteria in mass bins of width 0.05 m@xmath101 after scaling for the geometric probability of observing an eclipse for a given system .",
    "the results of our simulation are shown in figure [ figi ] .",
    "we estimate that the sdss - ii may contain as many as 12 low - mass eclipsing binary systems where both components are in the mass range @xmath95 .",
    "our estimate attempts to count systems that are likely to be identified in the sdss - ii data and for which precise determination of mass and radius will be possible .",
    "our simulation predicts the detection of between 1 and 7 stars ( @xmath102 confidence ) of mass @xmath103 , not inconsistent with our detection of the binary sdss - meb-1 ( comprised of two low - mass stars ) .",
    "these estimates are only rough approximations since the binary fraction of m dwarfs , and the properties of their companions , are not well known .",
    "work by @xcite points to an overabundance of short - period , @xmath104 m dwarf binary systems .",
    "any such systematic differences in the properties of m dwarf and g dwarf binaries would effect the validity of our estimates .    the high quality , and shear quantity , of the data produced by synoptic surveys like sdss - ii also opens up the possibility of searching for small companions extending down into the regime of brown dwarfs and extrasolar planets . in principle , it is possible to detect eclipses of jupiter - mass objects in the sdss - ii data . the giant planet and brown dwarf models of @xcite indicate that a companion more massive than @xmath105 results in an eclipse depth of @xmath100 for primaries with radii @xmath106 . while the @xmath98 eclipse signal is probably at the limit of detectability with our current photometric calibration of the sdss - ii data ,",
    "@xcite have shown that homogeneous , @xmath107 photometry can be derived from repeat sdss observations .",
    "future work focusing on purely differential photometry of stars in the sdss - ii data could potentially extend sensitivity to neptune - size planets orbiting the smallest stars . extrapolating from the 5 gyr , solar - metallicity isochrones of @xcite and the low - mass star colors of @xcite and @xcite",
    "( converting sdss to bessell colors ) we estimate that our current selection criteria identifies @xmath26 40,000 ( @xmath108 ) targets with @xmath106 . while detection of a transit by a jupiter - mass object may be feasible , follow - up radial - velocity observations to confirm the mass of the system will be very difficult for all but the brightest objects .",
    "our experience with sdss - meb-1 indicates that radial velocities with 10 km s@xmath30 precision should be feasible with reasonable exposure times for targets brighter than @xmath109 .",
    "if we assume that a radial - velocity signal of semi - amplitude @xmath110 km s@xmath30 can be detected with a reasonable investment of telescope time , then companions with @xmath111 can be detected in orbits with periods @xmath112 days around all of these targets .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated radial - velocity precision of 0.3 km s@xmath30 using high - resolution infrared spectroscopy , but only for relatively bright objects ( @xmath113 ) .",
    "unfortunately , only about 1100 of the m dwarfs we selected are this bright but for these targets we are capable of radial - velocity confirmation of companions as small as @xmath114 .",

    "we demonstrate that photometry of faint objects with sparse time sampling can be used to discover important new eclipsing systems . with these systems , the challenge will lie in the follow - up observations necessary to produce precise estimates of the physical parameters of the system and it is likely that robotic observing facilities will play a crucial role in these investigations .",
    "we have presented here a new low - mass double lined eclipsing binary discovered in a data set that can serve as a prototype for the next generation of synoptic surveys , and demonstrated that follow - up observations of these objects are feasible . by extending to fainter objects and focusing on smaller stars it will be possible to greatly expand the number of viable targets for a search for eclipsing low - mass star and brown dwarf companions .",
