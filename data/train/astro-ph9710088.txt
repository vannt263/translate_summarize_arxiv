    "a globular cluster contains about @xmath4 stars of different masses , generally with similar ages and metallicities . from both dynamical and stellar population points of view",
    ", globular clusters appear significantly simpler than galaxies . because they can be observed to much larger distances than individual stars , properties of globular clusters can be used to study the formation and evolution of their host galaxies . in particular , the discovery of a very large number of clusters associated with the giant elliptical galaxy m87 ( baum 1955 ; racine 1968 ; forte et al .  1981 ; strom et al .  1981 ) generated a number of fascinating questions about the formation of cluster systems of giant elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , van den bergh 1990 ; ashman & zepf 1992 ; harris 1995 ; kissler - patig 1997 ; forbes et al .",
    "1997a ) .",
    "particularly interesting is the discovery of bimodality in the color distribution of the globular cluster systems of some elliptical galaxies , which has been generally interpreted as a bimodal metallicity distribution ( e.g. , zepf & ashman 1993 ; geisler et al .",
    "1996 whitmore et al .  1996 ) .",
    "this suggests that the globular cluster systems of some ellipticals may be a superposition of different cluster populations .",
    "more progress in the understanding of the formation of cluster systems in galaxies is coming from large radial velocity surveys ( e.g. , mould et al .",
    "1987 , 1990 ; grillmair et al .  1994",
    "; hui et al .  1995 ; bridges et al .",
    "1997 , cohen & ryzhov 1997 ) .",
    "globular cluster systems are ideal probes for studying the dynamics of the outer parts of galaxies , where the surface brightness of the galaxy itself becomes too faint to provide useful kinematic data .",
    "furthermore , the masses of globular clusters are negligible with respect to the mass of the galaxy so that they directly trace the underlying gravitational potential .",
    "radial velocity surveys of globular cluster systems thus provide a powerful means to constrain the dynamical predictions of elliptical galaxy formation scenarios ( e.g. , isotropy , dark matter content ) .",
    "this is nicely illustrated by the recent work by cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) , who are able for the first time to accurately map the radial dependence of  in m87 , using radial velocities from _ keck _ spectroscopy of a large sample of 205 globular clusters .    in this paper",
    "we concentrate on the globular cluster system of ngc  1399 , the dominant e1_pec _ galaxy ( de vaucouleurs et al.1991 ) in the center of the fornax cluster .",
    "the ` peculiarity ' of this galaxy is that it is a cd galaxy with an unusually extended stellar envelope .",
    "ngc  1399 is surrounded by a very rich population of globular clusters ( hanes & harris 1986 ; geisler & forte 1990 ; wagner et al .",
    "1991 ; bridges et al .",
    "the clusters have a bimodal color distribution , as confirmed independently by different groups ( ostrov , geisler & forte 1993 ; kissler - patig et al.1997 ) .",
    "based on the photometry , these authors suggest two or more enrichment or formation episodes .    the only previous velocity measurements for globular clusters in ngc  1399 are those by grillmair et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , who found a large velocity dispersion ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "this velocity dispersion is larger than that of the fornax cluster itself , which has @xmath6  ( ferguson & sandage 1990 )",
    ". the mean radial velocity of the clusters studied by grillmair et al .",
    "is @xmath7 , which is actually larger than that of ngc  1399 itself . they inferred a large  ratio for this galaxy , viz .",
    "@xmath8 .",
    "figure  1a displays the radial velocity distribution of the 47 globular clusters in ngc  1399 as measured by grillmair et al .",
    "we notice that this velocity distribution is non - gaussian , and likely bimodal .",
    "the heliocentric radial velocity @xmath9  ( tully 1988 ) of the dominant galaxy ngc  1399 is close to the velocity of one of the peaks , while the other peak is close to the velocity of the nearby galaxy ngc  1404 with @xmath10 , located at about 10 arcmin ( @xmath1147 kpc ) se of the center of ngc  1399 . for comparison , the velocities listed in the rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "1991 ) for these galaxies are for ngc  1399 : @xmath12 , @xmath13   and for ngc  1404 : @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "figure  1b displays the radial velocity distribution of 67 galaxy members of the fornax cluster , as measured by ferguson ( 1989 ) .",
    "we also noticed that the velocity distribution of these galaxies appears non - gaussian .",
    "the radial velocity of ngc  1399 seems to be offset from the mean velocity of the fornax cluster , being smaller by about @xmath16 , depending on the adopted velocity of this galaxy : e.g. , ferguson ( 1989 ) takes @xmath17 .",
    "this offset is not surprising , given that the centroid of the x - ray emission of the fornax cluster is also offset from ngc  1399 ( ikebe et al .",
    "it is well known that some central galaxies are displaced from the center of their corresponding cluster potential well ( cf .",
    "hill et al .",
    "1988 ; beers et al .  1991 ; oegerle & hill 1994 ) , and this is usually taken as an indication of substructure within the clusters ( see the analysis by bird 1994 ) .",
    "given these indications of a complex system , the goal of this paper is two - fold :    1 .  to measure the radial velocities of a selected sample of globular clusters around ngc  1399 and to investigate the kinematics of the globular cluster system",
    ";    2 .  to derive , from the velocity dispersion of these globular clusters , the  for this galaxy at a radius intermediate between those probed by the galaxy integrated light and by the x - ray - emitting gas .",
    "defining a sample of globular clusters that traces the galaxy rather than the galaxy cluster potential is important , since some globulars may have been stripped away from galaxies and populate the intergalactic medium ( muzzio 1987 ; bassino et al .  1994 ;",
    "west et al .  1994 ) .",
    "for example , theuns & warren ( 1997 ) showed evidence for intergalactic stars in the fornax cluster , based on the discovery of 10 planetary nebulae . in relation to this ,",
    "the x - ray emission mapped by asca has been interpreted as the superposition of concentrated emission from ngc  1399 itself , and more extended emission from the whole galaxy cluster ( ikebe et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "there are observational indications that the kinematics of a globular cluster system may well depend on metallicity .",
    "for example , in the specific case of the merger ngc  5128 , hui et al .",
    "( 1995 ) combined the ngc  5128 globular cluster velocities from harris et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and sharples ( 1988 ) with the photometry of harris et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . dividing up the sample at [ fe / h ]  =  @xmath18 into a metal - poor and a metal - rich sample",
    ", they showed that the metal - rich globular cluster system of ngc  5128 rotates more rapidly and has smaller velocity dispersion than the metal - poor one .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the metal - rich globular clusters are more centrally concentrated ( minniti et al .",
    "1996 ) .    indeed",
    ", metal - rich clusters appear to be better tracers of the underlying metal - rich stellar populations , in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , forbes et al .",
    "1997a ) as well as in the milky way bulge ( e.g. , minniti 1995 ) . in order to study the kinematics of this population , we select metal - rich clusters in ngc  1399 on the basis of the colors measured by kissler - patig et al .",
    "the color distribution of ngc  1399 globular clusters is bimodal ( ostrov , geisler & forte 1993 ; kissler - patig et al.1997 ) . the color distribution shown by kissler - patig et al .",
    "( 1997 ) ranges from about @xmath19 to 1.5 , with peaks at @xmath20 and @xmath21 , the second peak corresponding to the mean color of the integrated light of ngc 1399 ( @xmath22 , poulain 1988 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the absolute location of these peaks in terms of [ fe / h ] is uncertain due to the age - metallicity degeneracy of optical colors ( see , e.g. , worthey 1994 , vazdekis et al .",
    "1996 ) . however , the two strong peaks differ by more than @xmath23[fe / h ] = 0.5 dex in the mean if interpreted as a pure metallicity difference .",
    "we selected globular cluster candidates over the whole color range mentioned above ( see figure 2 ) , focusing on metal - rich globular clusters which should have stronger spectral lines , which is an advantage for measuring radial velocities .",
    "these red candidates have @xmath24 , where we have adopted @xmath25 for this field ( kohle et al .",
    "these colors are equivalent to selecting clusters with [ fe / h ] @xmath26 ( see kissler - patig et al .",
    "1997 , their figure 4 ) , or a population similar to the metal - rich globular clusters associated with the milky way bulge ( minniti 1995 ) .",
    "we included a few candidates in the range @xmath27 , but all turned out to be stars , or to have too weak metal lines to measure good velocities .",
    "we further included even bluer and slightly brighter objects , in order to check whether ngc 1399 is hosting young- or intermediate - age globular clusters as seen in recent mergers ( e.g. ,  ngc  7252 , [ whitmore et al .",
    "1993 ] , ngc  1275 , [ holtzman et al . 1992",
    "; nrgaard  nielsen et al .",
    "1993 ] , ngc  5128 , [ minniti et al .  1996 ] or",
    "ngc  5018 [ hilker & kissler - patig 1996 ] ) .",
    "all of our selected best candidates had good enough spectra to identify them as clear foreground stars and exclude the hypothesis of younger globular clusters .",
    "finally , we included very red objects with @xmath28 , usually discarded in color distributions as background objects , in order to confirm their non - globular cluster nature . here",
    "too the test was successful in the sense that very red objects indeed turned out to be either m stars or background galaxies , and neither very metal  rich , nor reddened globular clusters .",
    "note that the errors in our photometry are small ( @xmath29 mag at @xmath30 ) , which is essential for the selection of clusters belonging to the metal - rich tail of the color distribution , and to the other groups considered .",
    "as to the magnitude limit , we adopt for ngc  1399 a distance modulus of @xmath31 after kohle et al .  (",
    "1996 ) . at this distance",
    ", 1 arcmin corresponds to 4.6 kpc .",
    "this distance modulus is intermediate between the distance moduli of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , adopted by grillmair et al.(1994 ) and ikebe et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , respectively .",
    "therefore , in order to minimize foreground objects but to be complete at the bright end of the globular cluster luminosity function , we chose objects with @xmath34 ( corresponding to @xmath35 ) , except for the very blue objects that were assumed to be potential young globular clusters , and therefore brighter , for which we chose candidates with @xmath36 ( i.e.  @xmath37 ) .",
    "figure 2 shows the color - magnitude diagram of 18 globular clusters with available spectra , along with 26 foreground stars .",
    "the color distribution of objects in the field of ngc  1399 from kissler - patig et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is shown for comparison .",
    "these tests indicate that globular cluster sample selection based on accurate magnitude and color limits can be very successful in deriving a clean globular cluster sample .",
    "spectroscopy of ngc 1399 clusters was carried out during four half - nights , in late 1995 and early 1996 , with the eso 3.5-m new technology telescope ( ntt ) equipped with the eso multi - mode instrument ( emmi ) in multi - object spectroscopy ( mos ) mode .",
    "the detector was a thin , back - illuminated ccd of type tektronix tk2048eb grade 2 , having 2048@xmath382048 pixels ( of size 24 @xmath39 m = 0268 pixel@xmath40 ) .",
    "we used grism no .  4 ( 2.8   pixel@xmath40 , blazed at 6500  ) .",
    "the wavelength range is @xmath41  , although the actual wavelength coverage of the individual spectra varied according to the location of the slitlets in the mos masks .",
    "the slitlets had a width of 134 , resulting in a spectral resolution of 7.5   .",
    "we decided to take spectra in the spectral range including the triplet ( @xmath428498,8542,8662  ) since the index is an excellent metallicity indicator , being independent of age for objects older than about 1 gyr ( bica & alloin 1987 , armandroff & zinn 1988 ) .",
    "unfortunately , the majority of our spectra do not have high enough s / n ratios to allow accurate metallicity abundance measurements .",
    "astrometry and photometry for the observed globular cluster candidates in ngc  1399 is available from kissler - patig et al .",
    "( 1997 ) . however , precise astrometry for mos targets alone is not sufficient to produce mos plates , since an accurate map of the distortion in the focal plane of the ntt was not available . to overcome this problem , short - exposure ( @xmath43 band , exp .",
    "time = 5 min ) `` acquisition '' images were kindly taken in advance by j. van loon , from which the ( @xmath44 ) positions of our targets were derived to produce the mos masks .",
    "the effective punching area for the mos masks is 5@xmath45@xmath388@xmath45 .",
    "three mos masks were made to include the maximum possible number of globular cluster candidates during the available time . in each mask ,",
    "two or three slitlets were punched at positions corresponding to bright `` reference '' galactic stars in the field of view , which were used to check the precision of the telescope pointing .",
    "spectra were taken on october 7 , 1995 for a field centered ne of ngc  1399 ( our field 2 ) , with a total exposure time of 150 minutes .",
    "the seeing was 10 , as judged from the direct image immediately preceding the mos observation .",
    "spectra for a field centered nw of ngc  1399 ( our field 4 ) were obtained on november 7 , 1995 , with a seeing of 09 and a total exposure time of 135 minutes , and the spectra for a field centered se of ngc  1399 ( our field 1 ) were obtained on january 30 and january 31 , 1996 , with an average seeing of 09 and a total exposure time of 130 + 110 minutes in the two half  nights .",
    "multiple exposures were acquired during each night .",
    "individual exposures were typically of 1800-s duration , and interleaved with short imaging exposures to correct for small pointing errors due to e.g. , flexure and differential atmospheric refraction ( the corrections needed were only of order 03 or smaller ; the airmass was always below 1.3 ) .",
    "the third mask , located in the se of ngc  1399 , has twice as many coadded exposures ( 6 ) than the other two masks , located at the nw and ne of the center of this galaxy .",
    "therefore , we were able to extract more spectra in the se field , and with higher s / n ratios .",
    "on the other hand , the nw field had the lowest s / n and objects fainter than v@xmath46 could barely be measured .",
    "the sw field could not be observed due to lack of time .",
    "the observations were made during bright time , with typical sky surface brightness of @xmath47 mag / arcsec@xmath48 .",
    "the underlying `` background '' brightness of the galaxy is more problematic only in the inner regions of ngc  1399 , where some of the targets are located : e.g. , @xmath49 mag / arcsec@xmath48 at 25 arcsec from the galaxy center ( goudfrooij et al .",
    "these objects require a longer exposure time , and the large background variations account for a wide range of s / n ratios achieved in the different spectra .",
    "a total of 20 bias frames were taken in the afternoon of each observing night .",
    "these were averaged together to form a `` superbias '' frame , in which the effect of read - out noise is rendered negligible .",
    "the superbias frame was subtracted from each `` science '' frame , after having been properly scaled to match the bias level in the serial overscan region of each observation .",
    "multiple dome flat field exposures were obtained for each mos mask with the grism in place , using an external lamp . after combining the flat field images for each individual mask , the flat fields were normalized to an average value of unity .",
    "this was done for each slitlet individually by dividing the measured wavelength response of the flat field lamp by a third - order polynomial fit .",
    "the two - dimensional spectra of each star and cluster candidate were extracted from the flatfielded mos frames and wavelength calibrated using the corresponding he - ar calibration lamp exposure .",
    "residual zeropoint errors were corrected using the night - sky lines which are numerous and prominent in the wavelength region covered .",
    "the extracted spectra were combined and appeared largely free of cosmic ray hits ; the few residual affected pixels were interpolated over by hand .",
    "the sky background was derived for each target individually by fitting a chebyshev polynomial to the background regions in the slitlets , along as well as perpendicular to the dispersion .",
    "the fitted background spectrum was then subtracted from each individual spectrum .",
    "the final spectra were cross - correlated with 2 - 3 stellar template spectra using the method of tonry & davis ( 1979 ) , incorporated in the package fxcor within iraf .",
    "night - sky lines , which are very numerous and prominent in the wavelength region covered , were used for the zero - point of the individual templates observed simultaneously with the same setup .",
    "although no radial velocity standards from the iau lists were observed , the zero point of our velocities is good to @xmath50 .",
    "cross - correlation peaks with @xmath51 ( this is the r ratio of tonry and davis 1979 , defined as the relative height of the main cross - correlation peak with respect to the neighboring peaks ) , were discarded , as their velocities are not reliable enough , judging from the cross correlations against the different templates .",
    "a total of 6 objects did not yield spectra with a s / n ratio high enough to meet this criterion .",
    "the typical fwhm of the cross - correlation peaks is about 500 , and the abscissa of the peak itself is defined to better than 100 . although the  triplet used to measure radial velocities is usually very strong in globular cluster spectra , it is weaker in the metal - poor globulars .",
    "therefore , we have concentrated on the metal - rich ones , for which velocities can be measured with higher confidence in relatively shorter exposure times .",
    "table 1 lists the globular cluster data : column 1 contains the object i d , columns 2 , 3 , 4 and 5 contain the x and y coordinates in arcsec from the center of the galaxy , and the j1950 equatorial coordinates , respectively , following kissler - patig et al .",

    "their classifications are listed in the last column .",

    "we obtained spectra for 28 stars ( see table 2 ) , some of which ( 7 ) were deliberately chosen as standard stars ( to use as pointing check and as radial velocity templates ) , and some ( 21 ) turned out to be failed young cluster candidates and reddened or super metal - rich cluster candidates .",
    "these spectra turn out to be very useful also to estimate the uncertainties , as discussed below .",
    "figure 3 shows the dependence of the radial velocity on the @xmath56 magnitudes and @xmath57 colors for the foreground stars and the ngc  1399 clusters . there is a clear segregation in radial velocity between the foreground stars and the globular clusters and background galaxies .",
    "all objects with @xmath58  are foreground stars and all objects brighter than @xmath59 are foreground stars or galaxies , but _ not _ globular clusters .",
    "the mean velocity of the foreground stars ( @xmath60 , @xmath61 ) matches the expected velocity of halo stars in this direction of the sky ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "sommer - larsen ( 1987 ) predicts , in this direction of the sky , a mean velocity and velocity dispersion of @xmath63  and @xmath64 , respectively .",

    "subtracting these in quadrature we obtain an intrinsic error per measurement of @xmath71 , which agrees with the typical errors listed in table 1 .",

    "we can also divide up the stellar sample according to their brightness ( see figure 3 ) .",

    "the fainter stars with @xmath75 have @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , consistent with a dominant halo population .",
    "this difference in velocity dispersion between the two subsamples persists even if we take into account that the fainter stars have larger errors",

    "( 1997b ) suggest that a large fraction of intermediate - metallicity clusters may have been stripped by ngc  1399 , in order to account for the low specific frequency of globulars in ngc  1404 .",
    "in fact , some of the clusters populating the high velocity tail of the distribution are indeed located in the direction of ngc  1404 .",
    "note that with a larger sample we should be able to distinguish whether the possible bimodality is indeed due to contamination from ngc  1404 , or if this is due to all the clusters being in nearly circular orbits .",
    "the latter situation has been argued to be appropriate for the galaxy m49 ( ngc  4472 ) , which also has a bimodal velocity distribution with peaks separated by about 500 ( mould et al .  1990 ) .    if we eliminate the cluster with highest radial velocity , arguing that it is a potential member of ngc  1404 or the fornax cluster of galaxies itself , then @xmath88 , and @xmath89  for @xmath90 objects .",

    "the present sample lacks objects in the sw region , and is more extended in the nw - se direction , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "more radial velocity measurements with adequate spatial distribution are needed to derive a figure rotation for the metal - rich cluster system of ngc  1399 .",
    "in addition , any fitting for rotation would have to assess the probability of contamination from the clusters associated with the nearby elliptical ngc  1404 and/or the intergalactic medium .",
    "we can use one of the jeans equations of stellar dynamics ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) , in order to estimate the mass of the system : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the total mass inside the radius @xmath94 , @xmath95 is the radial component of the velocity dispersion of the test particles , @xmath96 is the spatial density of the test particles , and @xmath97 = @xmath98 is a measure of the degree of anisotropy of the velocity distribution at each point .",

    "the globular clusters in ngc 1399 follow a clearly flatter distribution then in nearby smaller ellipticals ; however , the distribution still matches that of the galaxy light due to the extended cd envelope of ngc 1399 ( kissler - patig et al .",
    "no clear difference between the spatial distribution of the blue and red globular cluster populations have been found .",
    "grillmair et al .  (",
    "1994 ) used the jeans equation , adopting spherical symmetry and circular orbits , in order to compute a lower limit of @xmath101 for the cluster system of ngc  1399 .",
    "the velocity dispersion found here implies a slightly smaller : since @xmath102 , the @xmath103 value corresponding to @xmath104 of grillmair et al .  ( 1994 ) yields @xmath105 for @xmath106 .",
    "however , since @xmath107 , and since we have adopted a distance modulus @xmath108 which is 0.4 mag larger than that of grillmair et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , this value would be reduced further to @xmath109 .",
    "we have used the projected mass estimator ( heisler et al .",
    "1985 ) , again under the hypothesis of a spherical distribution of matter and isotropy of the velocity dispersion ( see perelmuter et al .",
    "1995 and bridges et al .",
    "1997 for similar applications of this method to other galaxies ) .",
    "the projected mass @xmath110 for an isotropic velocity ellipsoid is : @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the radial velocity of the considered globular cluster , @xmath113 is either the radial velocity of the galaxy or the mean radial velocity of the cluster sample , and @xmath114 the globular cluster distance on the plane of the sky from the center of the galaxy . for the 18 globular clusters with a mean radial velocity of 1353   for which @xmath115 , we obtain @xmath116 .",
    "this mass estimate , along with @xmath117 ( grillmair et al .",
    "1994 , scaled to our adopted distance ) , gives @xmath118 .",
    "the error in this quantity is dominated by the small sample size and the different underlying theoretical assumptions .",
    "e.g. , adopting radial instead of isotropic orbits for the globular clusters increases the mass estimate by a factor of two .    other mass estimators ( heisler et al .  1985",
    ") applied to the same sample give the following results : the virial mass @xmath119 implies @xmath120 , the median mass @xmath121 implies @xmath122 , and the average mass @xmath123 implies @xmath124 .",
    "the virial , projected , and average masses share the same sensitivity to interlopers .",
    "for example , if there are interlopers from the intracluster medium , or from the nearby galaxy ngc  1404 , these would tend to have higher velocities . eliminating the object with the largest radial velocity ( # 407 with @xmath125 ) from the present sample of 18 globular clusters , the above @xmath103 values decrease to @xmath126 for projected mass , @xmath127 for virial mass , @xmath128 for median mass , and @xmath129 average mass .",
    "these  values , obtained from the globular cluster system of ngc  1399 , are similar to the corresponding values obtained with the same mass estimators by huchra & brodie ( 1987 ) from the globular cluster system of m87 .",
    "contrary to the velocity dispersion determinations , which suffer only from the observational errors on the radial velocities , the mass - to - luminosity estimates accumulate the errors associated with many various observed parameters , such as the total luminosity within a given radius , the distance modulus and the radial velocity of the host galaxy , not to mention the different theoretical assumptions .",
    "considering the large uncertainties on the  determinations , reliable comparisons with the earlier study by grillmair et al.(1994 ) can be made only for the above determination using similar assumptions , namely use of the jeans equation and providing @xmath130 .",
    "this value is somewhat smaller than those reported in previous studies at large distance from the center of ngc  1399 , but it is in accord with the  values computed from the x - ray emission ( ikebe et al .",
    "note that this value of  is larger than that of a typical old stellar population ( @xmath131 ) , supporting the existence of dark matter .",
    "we also confirm that  increases with radius , ruling out a constant .",
    "a similar result , although much more accurate due to the large number of high quality _ keck _ spectra available , is obtained by cohen & ryzhov ( 1997 ) for the cluster system of m87 .",
    "the same conclusion can be reached by looking at figure 5 , which shows that our velocity dispersion measurement is intermediate between those from the outermost integrated stellar light ( from franx et al .",
    "1989 ; bicknell et al .  1989",
    "; winsall & freeman 1993 ) and the estimate from velocities of galaxies belonging to the fornax cluster ( from ferguson 1989 ) .",
    "we have measured velocities for 53 objects in the field of ngc  1399 , including 7 background galaxies , one dwarf galaxy in fornax , 18 globular cluster candidates , and 28 foreground stars . located in the central region of the fornax cluster of galaxies ,",
    "ngc  1399 is a particularly interesting system to use as a reference , because it does not seem to host young or intermediate age globular clusters as seen in recent or past mergers such as ngc 7252 , ngc 1275 , ngc  5128 or ngc 5018 .",
    "the main conclusions are :    @xmath132 we find that all candidates with @xmath133 are either foreground stars or background galaxies , and _ not _ young globular clusters .",
    "we also find that the very red ( @xmath28 ) objects in the color distribution are _ not _ ( very metal - rich or reddened ) globular clusters .",
    "@xmath132 the radial velocity distribution of metal rich globular clusters is different from the distribution of the whole population .",
    "in particular , it shows a dominant peak centered on the radial velocity of ngc  1399 itself .",
    "@xmath132 assuming that the metal - rich globular clusters are a better tracer of the underlying galaxy than the metal - poor ones , we have a sample that better traces the potential of this galaxy .",
    "we derive a velocity dispersion of @xmath115   ( or @xmath134  eliminating the cluster with largest velocity ) .",
    "these values are somewhat smaller than that measured by grillmair et al.(1994 ) , who did not discriminate against more metal - poor globular clusters .",
    "@xmath132 the kinematics of the globular cluster system of ngc  1399 are complicated , which is perhaps related to the presence of different populations as inferred from the bimodal color distribution , and assumptions of dynamical equilibrium or isotropy of the whole system are not warranted .",
    "in particular , we note that ngc  1399 is offset from the center of the fornax cluster potential well , both in velocity and in position in the sky .",
    "this suggests the presence of substructure in the fornax cluster , and in order to unravel the dynamics of the system , velocities for more tracers are needed .",
    "@xmath132 ignoring the previous conclusion , we derive , in a way similar to grillmair et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , an estimate of @xmath130 at a mean distance of @xmath135 arcmin .",
    "this value joins nicely the measurements based on the integrated galaxy light in the inner regions with those based on recent x - ray emission measurements in the outer regions ( ikebe et al .",
    "this would argue for  increasing with radius in this galaxy , though at more moderate rates than previously thought .",
    "other mass estimators provide  in the range 50 - 130 , although with large uncertainties .",
    "the total number of data points is too small to do a comprehensive statistical analysis , as @xmath136 points are required ( e.g. bird 1994 ) .",
    "consequently , larger radial velocity samples are needed .",
    "until they become available , we can neither precisely evaluate the rotation of the metal - rich globular cluster population , nor investigate its dynamics .",
    "other questions that remain to be answered are ( i ) the extent to which clusters that belong to ngc  1404 contribute to the measured dispersions , and ( ii ) whether or not some clusters from ngc  1404 been stripped by ngc  1399 in the past , as proposed by forbes et al .",
    "( 1997b ) .",
    "we speculate that the more metal - poor clusters may be responsible for the larger velocity dispersion , and therefore should have a more extended spatial distribution than the more metal - rich ones .",
    "this would support the possibility that some of these metal - poor clusters belong to the intragalactic medium of the fornax cluster , as suggested by muzzio ( 1987 ) , grillmair et al .",
