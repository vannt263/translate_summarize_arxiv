    "photoproduction of mesons is a well established tool for the investigation of excited states of the nucleon .",
    "reactions with meson pairs in the final state have gained a lot of interest because they allow the study of resonances that have small decay branching ratios to the nucleon ground state and decay instead via intermediate excited states .",
    "the best studied double - meson final state is pion pairs . in particular ,",
    "double @xmath16 production has been studied ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this reaction has the advantage that due to the small coupling of photons to neutral pions non - resonant background contributions are small .",
    "however , recently the @xmath0 final state has also attracted interest .",
    "total cross sections , invariant mass distributions , and also some polarization observables have been measured for the @xmath2 reaction at lns in sendai , japan @xcite , graal at esrf in grenoble , france @xcite , elsa in bonn , germany @xcite , and at mami in mainz , germany @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent summary ) .",
    "this decay channel is more selective than double-@xmath16 production .",
    "the @xmath15-meson is isoscalar , such that nucleon resonances can only emit it in @xmath17 or @xmath18 transitions .",
    "thus , one expects that two classes of nucleon resonances are important for this reaction : excited @xmath19-states with significant @xmath15-decays to the @xmath20(1232 ) and @xmath21 resonances decaying to @xmath22 via pion emission .",
    "the main signature of the first decay type are pion - nucleon invariant masses peaking at the @xmath20(1232 ) mass , while the latter will produce @xmath15 - nucleon invariant masses close to the @xmath22 position .",
    "these two components have been identified in the previously measured invariant mass distributions , which in addition show a signal from the @xmath23 decay in the @xmath15 - @xmath14 invariant mass @xcite .",
    "these analyses discovered a strong dominance of the @xmath24 decay chain ; in the threshold region from the @xmath25 and at higher incident photon energies from the @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "so far , there were only two cases where a photon - induced meson - production reaction is completely dominated by a single resonance and allows its almost background free study : pion production in the range of the @xmath20 resonance and @xmath15 production via the @xmath22 resonance @xcite .",
    "photoproduction of @xmath0-pairs offers the same chance for the @xmath25 , and in fact it has already been used in @xcite to extract parameters of this state .",
    "this is important because the structure of the @xmath25 is still under discussion .",
    "dring , oset , and strottman @xcite have studied this resonance with a coupled - channel chiral unitary approach for meson - baryon scattering in which it is dynamically generated .",
    "they also predict a dominant contribution of @xmath27 to the @xmath28 final state .",
    "this decay chain is characterized by its spin and isospin structure , which is much different from single @xmath15 production in the threshold region .",
    "the @xmath25 state can be electromagnetically excited by electric dipole ( @xmath29 ) or magnetic quadrupole ( @xmath30 ) photons .",
    "the @xmath31 decay is only possible for the @xmath15 emitted in relative @xmath32- or @xmath33-wave ( @xmath34=0,2 ) , and the @xmath32-wave is expected to dominate in the threshold region .",
    "the pion from the @xmath35 decay is emitted in a relative @xmath36-wave ( @xmath37=1 ) .",
    "therefore , the reaction may involve spin - flip and non - spin - flip transitions .",
    "their relative strengths can be calculated @xcite from the ratio of the helicity couplings @xmath38 of the @xmath39 resonance .",
    "the most recent values from the particle data review @xcite for the helicity couplings result in @xmath40 , which corresponds to @xmath41 @xcite , where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the spin - flip and spin - independent components of the reaction , respectively .",
    "the large contribution of the spin - independent part is in sharp contrast to single-@xmath15 production via the dominating @xmath22 resonance , which proceeds only through the spin - flip term .",
    "this has important consequences for the coherent production of @xmath6 pairs from nuclei as compared to coherent single @xmath15 production , which is forbidden for spin @xmath44 nuclei .",
    "coherent @xmath15 production has been investigated as a possible doorway for the formation of @xmath15-mesic states @xcite , but can not be used for some of the most promising candidates like @xmath45he nuclei .",
    "production of @xmath6 pairs can avoid this problem .",
    "the situation for the isospin structure is even more simple .",
    "the electromagnetic excitation of the @xmath20-resonance is identical for protons and neutrons . from the isoscalar nature of the @xmath15 ( @xmath46=0 ) and the isovector nature of the pion ( @xmath47=1 )",
    ", it follows immediately that the sequential reaction chain from the @xmath39 via the @xmath48 intermediate state must have the same isospin pattern as single photoproduction of pions through the @xmath20-resonance @xcite .",
    "thus , applying clebsch - gordon coefficients gives @xmath49 a test of these relations would give additional weight to the proposed dominance of the @xmath20-resonance decay .",
    "any deviations would point to significant contributions from other resonances or non - resonant backgrounds .",
    "so far , only data for the @xmath50 reaction is available . also , the isospin structure is very favorable for coherent production of @xmath6 pairs .",
    "since the electromagnetic helicity couplings for @xmath20-resonances are identical for protons and neutrons , no cancellations can occur .",
    "the present paper summarizes the results from the measurement of quasi - free production of @xmath0 pairs from nucleons bound in the deuteron for all four possible isospin combinations from eq .",
    "[ eq : isorel ] up to incident photon energies of 1.4 gev .",
    "total cross sections have been extracted for all four reaction channels and are compared to the results from the reaction model discussed in @xcite .",
    "in addition , the total cross section for the coherent reaction @xmath7 has been determined and compared to the model results from egorov and fix @xcite .",
    "the experiment was carried out at the mainz mami accelerator @xcite using a quasi - monochromatic photon beam with energies up to @xmath11.4 gev from the glasgow tagged photon spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the primary electron beam ( energy of 1.508 gev , for some part of the beam time 1.577 mev see @xcite ) produced bremsstrahlung photons in a copper radiator of 10 @xmath51 m thickness .",
    "the energy resolution of the photon beam is related to the 4 mev bin width of the tagger focal plane detectors .",
    "three different beam times with liquid deuterium targets and one measurement with a liquid hydrogen target for control were analyzed for the results summarized in this work .",
    "the same data set has already been analyzed in @xcite for beam - helicity asymmetries in quasi - free photoproduction of @xmath52 and @xmath53 pairs , for total cross sections and angular distributions in single @xmath15 production @xcite and single @xmath16 production @xcite .",
    "details for the setup , target and beam parameters , and analysis procedures are discussed in these references . here , only a short summary is given .",
    "the detector setup ( see @xcite for schematic drawings and details ) combined the crystal ball ( cb ) @xcite and taps @xcite electromagnetic calorimeters ( cb : 672 nai(tl ) crystals , taps : 384 baf@xmath54 crystals ) .",
    "the targets were mounted in the center of the cb and surrounded by a detector for charged particle identification ( pid ) @xcite .",
    "for the same purpose , all taps modules had individual plastic scintillators in front of the crystals ( ` taps - veto ' ) .",
    "the combined setup covered @xmath1  97% of the full solid angle and detected photons from the decays of the neutral mesons , charged pions , protons , neutrons , and deuterons .",
    "the analysis for the quasi - free reactions was almost identical to that for the @xmath52 and @xmath53 final states discussed in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "in the first step , hits in both calorimeters were classified as ` charged ' or ` neutral ' depending on the response of the pid and the taps - veto .",
    "charged hits in cb were separated into protons and charged pions using the @xmath55 analysis of the pid and cb .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : invmas ] .",
    "no direct separation between photons and neutrons was possible for hits in the cb .",
    "neutral hits in the cb were therefore , in this stage of the analysis , accepted as candidates for photons and neutrons .    for hits in taps ,",
    "photons and neutrons were separated as in @xcite using a pulse - shape analysis ( psa ) for the baf@xmath54 signals and a time - of - flight ( tof ) versus energy analysis .",
    "protons in taps were also required to have passed the psa as nucleons , and the tof - versus - e as protons .",
    "recoil deuterons in taps were separated ( for events with a @xmath6 pair ) from protons in the tof - versus - e spectra , where they appeared as a clearly separated band . charged pions in taps were not included in the analysis because the only identification possibility would have been tof - versus - e , but protons ( partly from reactions with much higher cross sections ) that leaked into the pion band produced substantial background .",
    "this means that for the @xmath56 and @xmath57 final states , a small part of the total reaction phase space ( charged pions at laboratory polar angles less than 20@xmath58 ) was not in the acceptance of the detector .",
    ".selected event classes for the cross sections @xmath59 ( coincident with recoil protons ) , @xmath60 ( coincident with recoil neutrons ) , @xmath61 ( no condition for recoil nucleons ) , @xmath62 ( coincident with recoil deuterons ) for @xmath0-pairs with neutral and charged pions . @xmath63 and @xmath64 mark",
    "neutral and charged hits in the calorimeter , respectively ( distinguished by the response of the charged - particle detectors ) .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     seven different event classes were analyzed in total ( see table [ tab : events ] ) .",
    "they correspond to both types of pions ( @xmath16 or @xmath65 ) , to reactions with coincident recoil protons ( @xmath59 ) and coincident recoil neutrons ( @xmath60 ) , the inclusive reaction @xmath61 without any condition for recoil nucleons , and for @xmath6 in addition to the coherent reaction ( coincident with recoil deuterons ) .",
    "the indices @xmath36 and @xmath63 refer to the final - state nucleons , protons and neutrons respectively .",
    "the inclusive reaction @xmath61 is independent from the recoil nucleon detection efficiencies and was used to check for systematic effects because it must satisfy the condition @xmath66 ( @xmath62 contributes only for @xmath6-pairs ) .    in the second step of the analysis ,",
    "a @xmath67 test of the invariant masses of pairs of neutral hits was made for events with three and more neutral hits , testing the hypothesis of @xmath16 and @xmath15 invariant masses .",
    "the @xmath67 of all possible combinations of neutral hits to disjunct pairs was calculated from @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the number of neutral mesons ( @xmath69 = 1 for @xmath70 final states , @xmath69 = 2 for @xmath6 ) and @xmath71 is the number of different combinations of the neutral hits to pairs ( @xmath71 = 1 for @xmath72 events , @xmath71 = 15 for @xmath73 events ) .",
    "the @xmath74 are the invariant masses of the i - th pair in the k - th permutation of the hits and the @xmath75 are the corresponding uncertainties computed event - by - event from the experimental energy and angular resolution . the mesons nominal masses @xmath76 were chosen such that for each event with four or five neutral hits , the hypotheses of a @xmath6 and a @xmath52 pair and for events with two or three neutral hits , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 hypotheses were tested .",
    "only the combination with the minimum @xmath67 was selected for further analysis . for events with an odd number of neutral hits , for which no hit was directly identified as a neutron ,",
    "the one which was not identified as a meson decay photon by the @xmath67-test was assigned to the neutron .    the two - dimensional invariant mass spectrum for the @xmath6 final state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : invmas ] .",
    "the regions around the @xmath6 peaks are scaled up by a factor of 50 with respect to the @xmath52 peak .",
    "the remaining background below the peaks appears mainly as a band at the @xmath16 invariant mass running parallel to the axis of @xmath15 invariant mass .",
    "the spectra were therefore projected onto @xmath15-invariant masses .",
    "they were fitted with a third degree polynomial and the simulated line shape of the @xmath15 invariant mass peaks .",
    "residual background was removed in two further steps .",
    "the coplanarity of the events ( i.e. the condition that in the photon - nucleon center - of - momentum ( cm ) system , the azimuthal angle between the recoil nucleon momentum and the sum of the meson momenta must be 180@xmath58 ) was tested .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mismas ] . background for detection of @xmath77 triples is almost negligible , for @xmath78 triples it is small . in the final step ,",
    "the missing mass of the events ( although the recoil nucleon was detected , it was treated as a ` missing ' particle ) was analyzed as described in @xcite for double @xmath16 production .",
    "the resulting spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mismas ] ) were almost background free and the selection criteria indicated in the figure were applied .",
    "the identification of the coherent @xmath7 reaction used the same analysis steps for the two neutral mesons .",
    "the recoil deuterons were identified in taps by a tof - versus - e analysis .",
    "the final step was a missing - mass analysis ( the deuteron was treated as missing particle ) .",
    "typical spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coh_iden ] . the tof - versus - e spectrum shows a clear deuteron band structure .",
    "the missing - mass spectrum is almost background free and perfectly reproduced by the monte carlo simulation ( the signal width is much more narrow than for the quasi - free reactions ) .",
    "also deuterons which were stopped in the taps - veto were accepted . in this case , the tof - versus - e analysis was based on the signals from the taps - veto detectors ( not shown in the figure ) .",
    "the analysis of the @xmath70 final state was carried out analogously to the analysis of @xmath53 pairs in @xcite .",
    "charged pions were selected by the @xmath79 cut shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : invmas ] and the @xmath15 invariant mass peaks were fitted with background polynomials and simulated peak line shapes .",
    "this was followed by coplanarity and missing - mass analysis cuts .",
    "the results are shown at the bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : mismas ] .",
    "the only significant background observed was in the coplanarity spectra of the @xmath80 final state .",
    "it is related to events from the @xmath81 reaction , for which one @xmath16-decay photon has escaped detection , the other photon from the same @xmath16 was misassigned as a neutron , and the proton was misidentified as a charged pion .",
    "the shape of this background could be reproduced by monte carlo simulations with geant4 .",
    "the background below the 180@xmath58 peak was subtracted and this was done individually for each data point in the subsequent missing mass spectra .",
    "the resolution in the missing - mass spectra is worse than for neutral pions because of the less precise measurement of the energies of the charged pion in the calorimeter .",
    "however , there is basically no background visible in the missing mass spectra and the line shapes are well reproduced by monte carlo simulations .",
    "although figs .",
    "[ fig : invmas],[fig : mismas ] show spectra obtained by integration over all incident photon energies and other variables ( angles , invariant masses ) the actual analysis was performed individually for each bin of photon energy and other variables for differential spectra .",
    "the extracted yields were converted to cross sections using the target surface densities ( 0.231@xmath820.005 barn@xmath83 for most of the beam times , see @xcite for details ) , the incident photon flux , the simulated detection efficiency , and the decay branching ratios @xcite of @xmath16 ( 98.823@xmath820.034% ) and @xmath15 ( 39.41@xmath82 0.20 % ) mesons into photon pairs . more details are given in @xcite .",
    "the detection efficiency was simulated similarly as in @xcite with the geant4 code @xcite .",
    "since the reaction is dominated by the @xmath84 chain , the sequential decay with the intermediate @xmath85 state was used for the event generator .",
    "this generator describes the missing mass distributions ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mismas ] and the @xmath0 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 invariant mass distributions ( not shown ) very well .",
    "the angular distributions deviate not much from isotropy , which was used for the mc ( see @xcite for angular distributions of the free @xmath2 reactions , the results for the other isospin channels are similar ) .",
    "therefore , the simulation reflects all relevant properties of the reaction . as in @xcite",
    ", corrections for the recoil nucleon detection efficiencies obtained from direct measurements have been applied .",
    "total cross sections for final states with detected recoil nucleons were analyzed in two ways ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the reconstruction as a function of the incident photon energy profits from the good energy resolution of the spectrometer , but the results are folded in with nuclear fermi motion . in the second analysis ,",
    "the fermi - momentum corrected cm energy @xmath88 was reconstructed from the kinematics of the final state .",
    "this eliminates the fermi smearing , but introduces effects from experimental resolution ( energies and angles measured with the calorimeters ) into the @xmath88 measurement .",
    "however , for the present measurement no rapid variations of the cross sections are involved .",
    "both effects are therefore not important .",
    "the quasi - free cross section data extracted by the two methods are in good agreement ( apart from the immediate threshold region where fermi motion smears out the excitation function across the free production threshold ) .",
    "furthermore , an analysis of free proton data with the @xmath88 reconstruction method ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : total]c ) gives an identical result as the use of the incident photon energy ( in the latter case neither fermi motion nor reconstruction resolution enter ) .",
    "systematic uncertainties of the data have been discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the total overall normalization uncertainty ( photon flux , target density ) is between 5% ( quadratic addition ) and 7% ( linear addition ) .",
    "uncertainties from analysis cuts and simulation of the detection efficiency excluding the recoil nucleons are in the range of 5 - 10% .",
    "the uncertainty from the recoil nucleon detection efficiency has been estimated in @xcite at the 10% level .",
    "it can be additionally checked by the comparison of the inclusive cross sections with the sum of the exclusive ones ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : results ] ) .",
    "the overall normalization uncertainties cancel in all ratios .",
    "the effects from the meson detection cancel almost completely for the @xmath89 and for the @xmath90 ratios , and partly for the others .",
    "the results for the total cross sections are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : total ] . figs .",
    "[ fig : total]a , [ fig : total]b correspond to the analysis as a function of incident photon energies , figs .",
    "[ fig : total]c and [ fig : total]d show the cross sections extracted as a function of reconstructed final state invariant masses . for both types of @xmath0 pairs",
    "inclusive cross sections and the summed up exclusive cross sections agree with each other within approximately 5% ( this test is only possible for the analysis using incident photon energies since the final state reconstruction requires detection of the recoil nucleons ) .",
    "deviations for the charged pions are statistically distributed but the deviations for the neutral pions seem to be systematic . a possible systematic effect",
    "could arise in the inclusive @xmath6 cross section because the event generator used for this reaction did not take into account that events from the coherent reaction have different angular distributions .",
    "free - proton data from the measurement with the liquid hydrogen target have also been analyzed . in the case of @xmath6 pairs ,",
    "the results are in excellent agreement with previous measurements @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : total]c ) ; the @xmath4 reaction has been measured for the first time .",
    "the results for the @xmath91 final state are in good agreement with the isobar model of fix et al .",
    "@xcite ( which is expected because the model was fitted to the existing @xmath91 data ) , but for the @xmath92 final state agreement is not so good above @xmath93  gev .",
    "in contrast to single @xmath15 production @xcite , but similar to single @xmath16 production @xcite , there is a significant cross section difference between free and quasi - free results , indicating that final state interaction ( fsi ) effects are present .",
    "fsi seems to be larger for neutral pions than for charged pions ( the same is true for single pion production @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , under the assumption that fsi effects are similar for protons and neutrons , cross section ratios can be extracted .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios]a .",
    "they are in quite good agreement with eq .",
    "[ eq : isorel ] and also with the model results from @xcite .",
    "the ratios for reactions with charged and neutral pions are influenced by the different fsi effects .",
    "they are in fact somewhat larger than predicted .",
    "the results for the coherent reaction @xmath94 are compared in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratios]b to model predictions from egorov and fix @xcite and good agreement is found here . in summary ,",
    "the isospin dependence of the total cross sections is in excellent agreement with the expectations for a dominant @xmath84 contribution .",
    "differential spectra for invariant mass distributions of the @xmath14-@xmath15 pairs and the meson - nucleon pairs have been constructed from full kinematic reconstruction of the final states so that they are not effected by fermi motion .",
    "the invariant mass distributions for reactions of protons and neutrons and for neutral and charged pions are basically identical ( after re - normalization of their absolute scales ) and in excellent agreement with model predictions from @xcite .",
    "the most prominent feature of this distributions is a pronounced structure in the nucleon - pion invariant mass distributions at the invariant mass of the @xmath20(1232 ) resonance in agreement with the assumption of an intermediate @xmath95 state in the @xmath84 reaction chain .",
    "angular distributions have been analyzed as in @xcite in two different cm frames , the canonical and the helicity system .",
    "also the angular distributions do not show much difference between proton and neutron targets or between neutral and charged pions .",
    "agreement with the model predictions from @xcite is reasonable for all observables , which is further evidence that the dominating production mechanisms are well understood .",
    "the results for this differential cross sections and also for polarization observables like the beam - helicity asymmetry measured with a circularly polarized photon beam and an unpolarized target will be discussed in a detailed paper following the present letter .",
    "precise results have been obtained for the photoproduction of @xmath6 pairs from free protons , quasi - free protons , quasi - free neutrons bound in deuterium , and coherently from deuterons .",
    "production of @xmath56 pairs has been studied for free and quasi - free protons and production of @xmath57 pairs for quasi - free neutrons .",
    "this means that all possible isospin channels for photoproduction of @xmath0-pairs from nucleons and from the deuteron have now been measured ( previous experiments covered only the free @xmath2 reaction ) .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows :    the comparison of free and quasi - free measurements for proton targets indicates significant fsi effects .",
    "these effects are quantitatively not precisely understood , but seem to be more important for the comparison of reactions with neutral and charged pions than for the comparison of final states with the same type of pions but different nucleons .",
    "this is similar to the photoproduction of single pions which shows also much larger effects for neutral pions due to the different fsi effects in the @xmath96 system ( which can be bound in the final state ) compared to the @xmath97 and @xmath98 systems @xcite .",
    "the most important results are the cross section ratios for the different isospin channels of the quasi - free production reactions .",
    "they allow model independent conclusions about the dominant reaction mechanism .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : isorel ] ) is valid for ( i ) @xmath99 and ( ii ) @xmath100 reaction chains , but not for @xmath101 or @xmath102 sequences ( for the latter @xmath103=2 would hold and the cross section ratios for neutron and proton targets would depend on the corresponding ratios of the helicity couplings of the primary @xmath21 resonance ) .",
    "this is clear evidence for a dominant contribution from primary excitation of @xmath19 resonances .",
    "after re - normalization of the absolute magnitudes , invariant mass distributions of the @xmath14-@xmath15 pairs and the meson - nucleon pairs are in agreement for all four reaction channels .",
    "they show the same features already observed for the free @xmath50 reaction @xcite ) .",
    "this is in particular a dominant signal from the decay of the @xmath104 intermediate state in the @xmath105 invariant mass .",
    "contributions from the @xmath106 meson in the @xmath0 invariant mass become important only at higher incident photon energies @xcite ) , and the signal from the n(1535)@xmath107 intermediate state in the @xmath108 invariant mass is small .",
    "the experimental results for total cross sections and invariant mass distributions are in good agreement with model predictions from fix et al .",
    "@xcite apart from the scale difference for quasi - free reactions due to fsi effects . also , the angular distributions are in reasonable agreement with expectations .",
    "the good agreement between the total cross section for the coherent @xmath7 process and the model predictions from egorov and fix @xcite is further evidence that the isospin decomposition of this reaction is well understood .",
