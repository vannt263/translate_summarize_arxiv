    "recently , the physical meaning of the two parameters in static vacuum hypercylindrical solutions in five dimensions  @xcite was correctly interpreted in ref .  @xcite . in the analogy of weak field solutions for a cylindrical matter source distributed along the fifth direction",
    "uniformly , the author identified the two parameters with  mass \" and  tension \" densities  .",
    "it is also pointed out that the well - known schwarzschild black string solution corresponds to the case that the tension - to - mass ratio is exactly one half .",
    "this means that the schwarzschild black string , which was believed to be a family of solutions characterized by the mass density only , is indeed a special case of a wider class of solutions characterized by tension density as well .",
    "note also that in @xmath3-dimensional spacetime , there is another class of stationary solutions which is characterized by the  mass \" and  momentum \" densities along the extra - directions  @xcite .",
    "the schwarzschild black string background is known to be unstable under small gravitational perturbations along the fifth direction - the so - called gregory - laflamme ( gl ) instability  @xcite .",
    "therefore , studying the physical role of tension might give a better understanding about what really causes the gl instability .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the geometric properties of this class of spacetimes with arbitrary tension in five dimensions were investigated in detail .",
    "some of main properties are as follows .    *",
    "the solutions are classified by the tension - to - mass ratio @xmath4 .",
    "the event horizon exists only when the tension density is a half of the mass density , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5 . only in this case",
    "the spacetime can be called a black string .",
    "all spacetimes having other values of the tension - to - mass ratio than @xmath6 and @xmath7 have a naked singularity at ` center ' . *",
    "even though there is a naked singularity instead of an event horizon , light radiated from it is infinitely red - shifted provided that @xmath8 .",
    "* the geometry of some subspaces behaves interestingly . for @xmath9 or",
    "@xmath10 the area of @xmath11 sphere monotonically decreases down to zero as one approaches to the naked singularity from infinity as usual . for @xmath12",
    ", however , it bounces up and increases again up to infinity at the naked singularity as in the geometry of a wormhole spacetime .",
    "* on the other hand , the proper length of a segment along the fifth direction shrinks down to zero for @xmath13 , but expands to infinity for @xmath14 as one approaches the naked singularity . *",
    "although the @xmath11 area and the segment length compete each other , the total area of the segment @xmath15 turns out to decrease monotonically down to zero at the singularity except for @xmath16 . for the case of @xmath5",
    "the area of @xmath11 becomes finite at the horizon and the scale factor of the fifth direction is constant .",
    "the geodesic motions in this spacetime were also studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we investigate how much these features change if the spacetime dimensionality becomes higher than five .",
    "for the case of @xmath17 , for instance , since the area of @xmath11 sphere shrinks to zero whereas the proper length along the fifth direction diverges , one may expect that the total area might not shrink down to zero if one increases the number of extra dimensions large enough .",
    "in addition , since there will be more number of tension parameters as the number of extra dimensions increases , one may wonder if there are more black brane solutions in addition to higher dimensional schwarzschild black branes .",
    "higher dimensional spacetime solutions having translational symmetry along extra dimensions and spherical symmetry on slices perpendicular to them have been discovered by many authors in the literature in different contexts  @xcite .",
    "for instance , much more general solutions even in the presence of dilatonic scalar fields and antisymmetric forms were found in refs .",
    "( see also references therein . )",
    "however , the full and detailed analysis of the geometry and correct interpretation of the ` tension ' parameter have not been done so far as long as we know .    in section",
    "ii , we study the geometric properties of the trans - spherical vacuum solutions in @xmath1 dimensions in detail . in section iii",
    ", we analyze the causal structure of the solution .",
    "finally in section iv , we summarize our results and discuss physical implications of them .",
    "we consider static solutions for the vacuum einstein equations in @xmath1 dimensions , which are invariant under translations along the extra @xmath0-dimensions and are spherically symmetric on the @xmath18-dimensions transverse to the @xmath0-dimensions .",
    "the most general form of the metric with the symmetries may be written as @xmath19 here @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are functions of the isotropic coordinate @xmath23 only .",
    "this class of spacetime solutions will be characterized by the @xmath0-number of tension densities @xmath24 along @xmath25 and the adm mass density @xmath26 associated with the spatial and time translation symmetries , respectively  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the exponents in the metric component functions depend only on the dimensionless tension - to - mass ratio @xmath27 defined as @xmath28 for convenience , we define the sums of @xmath27 and @xmath29 by @xmath30 where @xmath31 runs over spatial extra - dimensions .",
    "note that these definitions for @xmath4 and @xmath32 restrict values of @xmath32 such that @xmath33 as shown by the shaded region in fig .  1 below .",
    "the solutions in this general higher dimensions were found by several authors  @xcite and can be expressed as @xmath34 by using the adm mass and adm tensions . here",
    "the integration constant @xmath35 is related to the adm mass @xmath26 by @xmath36^{\\frac1{2}}\\frac{4\\pi g_d m}{\\omega_{(n+2 ) } } , \\label{m : ma}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 , and @xmath38 is the @xmath39-dimensional newton constant .",

    "( [ m : ma ] ) is positive definite for all real values of @xmath27 .",
    "the solutions  ( [ sol2 ] ) are described by @xmath40 independent parameters , @xmath35 and @xmath27 .",
    "it is interesting to see that the functions @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath41 depend only on the sums of @xmath27 and @xmath29 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath4 and @xmath42 ) , not on the individual values of @xmath27 .",
    "the double wick rotations @xmath43 and @xmath44 of the metric  ( [ metric : ansatz ] ) also satisfies the vacuum einstein equation .",
    "let us analyze geometrical properties of the spacetime solutions described above and see how they depend on the spacetime dimensionality .",
    "first of all , one sees that these spacetimes become flat as either @xmath45 or @xmath46 .",
    "the same happens in 4d schwarzschild and reissner - nordstrom solutions written in isotropic coordinates . from the form of solutions , we find that the component functions of the metric , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 show different behaviors as @xmath47 , depending on the sign of their exponents . here",
    "@xmath48 note that the region with @xmath49 is another copy of the spacetime region covered by @xmath50 as in the case of the @xmath3-dimensional one  @xcite  . ] .",
    "although arbitrary values of @xmath35 ( _ e.g. _ , @xmath26 ) are allowed , we assume non - negative values of adm mass density for discussions below .",

    "( [ an : fin ] ) have non - vanishing finite area @xmath79 .",
    "namely , in the parameter space of @xmath0-dimensional @xmath27 , this region is given as the intersection of the @xmath84-dimensional sphere @xmath85 and a @xmath84-dimensional plane @xmath86 for each @xmath75 on the hyperbola  ( [ an : fin ] ) in the shaded region in fig .  1 .",
    "if @xmath87 , the behavior of the area is basically the same as the case of @xmath88 in @xmath3-dimensions .",

    "therefore , this spatial geometry looks like a wormhole .",

    "the @xmath25 direction becomes flat if @xmath107 equivalently , @xmath108 .",
    "for other values of tension ratios , we see that @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ sol2 ] ) becomes singular as @xmath23 goes to @xmath78 .",
    "namely , as @xmath23 decreases to @xmath78 , the proper length of a unit segment with @xmath109 at @xmath110 constant surface shrinks to zero if @xmath111 , but it infinitely expands if @xmath112 .",
    "however , we point out that all these cases do not necessarily correspond to singular spatial geometry in extra @xmath0-dimensions .",
    "consider a kaluza - klein bubble solution along the @xmath113 direction , in which @xmath114 vanishes at @xmath54 with @xmath115 .",
    "we can easily check that there exist no curvature singularity in this case .",
    "indeed , the @xmath54 surface turns out to be a fixed point whose conical singularity can be removed by compactifying the @xmath25 coordinate suitably as mentioned before .",
    "hence , the @xmath113 direction becomes a circle .",
    "in general , if @xmath116 , one can find many solutions where some extra directions become circles in this way . however , all those solutions contain curvature singularity at @xmath54 except for the case of the kaluza - klein bubble solutions .",
    "to summarize , we find that the regular spatial geometry in extra @xmath0-dimensions happens only for the schwarzschild black @xmath0-brane and kaluza - klein bubble solutions .",
    "it is interesting to see how the total spatial volume @xmath81 for a given @xmath23 behaves as @xmath47 .",
    "the total volume for @xmath117 constant surface per unit lengths of @xmath25 with respect to an asymptotic observer is given by @xmath118 where @xmath80 is the spatial volume of extra @xmath0-dimensions @xmath119 we see that the spatial volume @xmath80 becomes unit when @xmath120 which is designated by the vertical line in fig .",
    "it is interesting to see that the total volume @xmath80 could be finite if the divergence at a certain direction can be precisely canceled out by the shrinking of some other directions .",

    "in addition , we point out that the geometry of the sphere is regular since this case satisfies eq .",
    "( [ an : fin ] ) as well .",
    "in fact , the solution with parameters in eq .",
    "( [ pta ] ) corresponds to the schwarzschild black @xmath0-brane  ( [ schwarz ] ) in higher dimensions .",
    "since either @xmath79 or @xmath129 diverges depending on the values of tensions one may expect the total volume @xmath81 also diverges .",
    "however , we claim that it never happens for any values of tension parameters .",
    "this can be seen because the exponent of @xmath124 $ ] takes a positive value for all cases except for the case of uniform tensions so that the total volume @xmath81 vanishes as @xmath47 .",
    "this happens because , even if the volume of the sphere diverges for certain values of parameters @xmath27 , @xmath80 shrinks more strongly for those values of parameters .",
    "similarly , for the case in which @xmath80 diverges , @xmath79 shrinks more strongly .",
    "the idea of making divergent total volume @xmath81 by adding expanding extra - dimensions arbitrarily does not work .",
    "this is because as @xmath0 increases , both of the expanding rate in @xmath80 and shrinking in @xmath79 changes as well so that the net effect always gives vanishing total volume .",
    "so far , we have not restricted the values of @xmath27 .",
    "however , their physical ranges may be given by some energy conditions .",
    "note that the strong energy condition in @xmath3-dimensional spacetime restricts the value of tension  @xcite . in @xmath130-dimensional spacetimes , this extends as follows@xmath131 although we do not know whether the gravitational tensions satisfy the same condition , we assume that the same restriction holds as in the case of matter fields .",

    "here @xmath137 with @xmath138 is the half of the exponent of @xmath139 in @xmath22 .",
    "we see that the right hand side of the first line becomes singular as @xmath47 since @xmath140 .",
    "thus , there occurs a curvature singularity at @xmath54 unless the term inside the curly - bracket cancels this divergence .",

    "<S> we investigate the geometrical properties of static vacuum @xmath0-brane solutions of einstein gravity in @xmath1 dimensions , which have spherical symmetry of @xmath2 orthogonal to the @xmath0-directions and are invariant under the translation along them . </S>",
    "<S> the solutions are characterized by mass density and @xmath0 number of tension densities . </S>",
    "<S> the causal structure of the higher dimensional solutions is essentially the same as that of the five dimensional ones . </S>",
    "<S> namely , a naked singularity appears for most solutions except for the schwarzschild black @xmath0-brane and the kaluza - klein bubble . </S>",
    "<S> we show that some important geometric properties such as the area of @xmath2 and the total spatial volume are characterized only by the three parameters such as the mass density , the sum of tension densities and the sum of tension density squares rather than individual tension densities . </S>",
    "<S> these geometric properties are analyzed in detail in this parameter space and are compared with those of 5-dimensional case . </S>"
