    "with the popularity and accessibility of online social networks ( osns ) , e.g. , facebook , meetup , and skout , more and more people initiate friend gatherings or group activities via these osns .",
    "for example , more than 16 millions of events are created on facebook each month to organize various kinds of activities , and more than 500 thousands of face - to - face activities are initiated in meetup .",
    "the activities organized via osns cover a wide variety of purposes , e.g. , friend gatherings , cocktail parties , concerts , and marathon events .",
    "the wide spectrum of these activities shows that osns have been widely used as a convenient means for initiating real - life activities among friends .    on the other hand , to help users expand their circles of friends in the cyberspace , friend recommendation services have been provided in osns to suggest candidates to users who may likely become mutual friends in the future .",
    "many friend recommendation services employ link prediction algorithms , e.g. , @xcite , to analyze the features , similarity or interaction patterns of users in order to derive potential future friendship between some users . by leveraging the abundant information in osns ,",
    "link prediction algorithms show high accuracy for recommending online friends in osns .",
    "as social presence theory @xcite in social psychology suggests , computer - mediated online interactions are inferior to face - to - face , in - person interactions , off - line friend - making activities may be favorable to their on - line counterparts in cyberspace . therefore ,",
    "in this paper , we consider the scenarios of organizing face - to - face friend - making activities via osn services . notice that finding socially cohesive groups of participants is essential for maintaining good atmosphere for the activity .",
    "moreover , the function of making new friends is also an important factor for the success of social activities , e.g. , assigning excursion groups in conferences , inviting attendees to housewarming parties , etc .",
    "thus , for organizing friend - making social activities , both activity organization and friend recommendation services are fundamental .",
    "however , there is a gap between existing activity organization and friend recommendation services in osns for the scenarios under consideration .",
    "existing activity organization approaches focus on extracting socially cohesive groups from osns based on certain cohesive measures , density , diameter , of social networks or other constraints , e.g. , time , spatial distance , and interests , of participants ycl11,ysl12,zhx14,syy14 . on the other hand ,",
    "friend recommendation services consider only the _ existing friendships _ to recommend potential new friends for an individual ( rather than finding a group of people for engaging friend - making ) .",
    "we argue that in addition to themes of common interests , it is desirable to organize friend - making activities by mixing the `` potential friends '' , who may be interested in knowing each other ( as indicated by a link prediction algorithm ) , with existing friends ( as lubricators ) . to the best knowledge of the authors , the following two important factors , 1 ) the existing friendship among attendees , and 2 ) the potential friendship among attendees , have not been considered simultaneously in existing activity organization services .",
    "to bridge the gap , it is desirable to propose a new activity organization service that carefully addresses these two factors at the same time .    in this paper",
    ", we aim to investigate the problem of selecting a set of candidate attendees from the osn by considering both the existing and potential friendships among the attendees .",
    "to capture the two factors for activity organization , we propose to include the likelihood of making new friends in the social network . as such",
    ", we formulate a new research problem to find groups with tight social relationships among existing friends and potential friends ( i.e. , who are not friends yet ) .",
    "specifically , we model the social network in the osn as a heterogeneous social graph @xmath1 with edge weight @xmath2 $ ] , where @xmath3 is the set of individuals , @xmath4 is the set of _ friend edges _ , and @xmath5 is the set of _ potential friend edges _ ( or potential edges for short ) . here",
    "a friend edge @xmath6 denotes that individuals @xmath7 and @xmath8 are mutual friends , while a potential edge @xmath9 $ ] indicates that individuals @xmath10 and @xmath11 are likely to become friends ( the edge weight @xmath12 $ ] quantifies the likelihood ) .",
    "the potential edges and the corresponding edge weights can be obtained by employing a link prediction algorithm in friend recommendation .",
    "given a heterogeneous social graph @xmath1 as described above , we formulate a new problem , namely , _",
    "hop - bounded maximum group friending ( hmgf ) _ , to find a group that 1 ) maximizes the likelihood of making new friends among the group , i.e. , the group has the highest ratio of total potential edge weight to group size , 2 ) ensures that the social tightness , i.e. , hop count on friend edges in @xmath13 between each pair of individuals is small , and 3 ) is a sufficiently large group , i.e. , too small a group may not work well for socialization activities .",
    "[ examples ]    figure [ examples ] illustrates the social graph and the interplay of the above factors . figure [ illu_exp ] shows a social graph , where a dash line , e.g. , @xmath14 $ ] with weight 0.6 , is a potential edge and a solid line , e.g. , @xmath15 , is a friend edge .",
    "figure [ h_1 ] shows a group @xmath16:@xmath17 which has many potential edges and thus a high total weight .",
    "however , not all the members of this group have common friends as social lubricators . figure [ h_2 ] shows a group @xmath18:@xmath19 tightly connected by friend edges . while @xmath18 may be a good choice for gathering of close friends , the goal of friend - making in socialization activities is missed .",
    "finally , figure [ h_3 ] shows @xmath20:@xmath21 which is a better choice than @xmath16 and @xmath18 for socialization activities because each member of @xmath20 is within 2 hops of another member via friend edges in @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , the average potential edge weight among them is high , indicating members are likely to make some new friends .",
    "processing hmgf to find the best solution is very challenging because there are many important factors to consider , including hop constraint , group size and the total weight of potential edges in a group .",
    "indeed , we prove that hmgf is an np - hard problem with no approximation algorithm .",
    "nevertheless , we prove that if the hop constraint can be slightly relaxed to allow a small error , there exists a 3-approximation algorithm for hmgf .",
    "theoretical analysis and empirical results show that our algorithm can obtain good solutions efficiently .    the contributions made in this study are summarized as follows .",
    "* for socialization activity organization , we propose to model the existing friendship and the potential friendship in a heterogeneous social graph and formulate a new problem , namely , hop - bounded maximum group friending ( hmgf ) , for finding suitable attendees . to our best knowledge , hmgf is the first problem that considers these two important relationships between attendees for activity organization .",
    "* we prove that hmgf is np - hard and there exists no approximation algorithm for hmgf unless @xmath0 .",
    "we then propose an approximation algorithm , called maxgf , with a guaranteed error bound for solving hmgf efficiently .",
    "* we conduct a user study on @xmath22 users to validate our argument for considering both existing and potential friendships in activity organization .",
    "we also perform extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the proposed algorithm .",
    "experimental results manifest that hmgf can obtain solutions very close to the optimal ones , very efficiently .",
    "[ prob ]    based on the description of heterogeneous social graph described earlier , here we formulate the _ hop - bounded maximum group friending ( hmgf ) _ tackled in this paper .",
    "given two individuals @xmath7 and @xmath8 , let @xmath23 be the shortest path between @xmath7 and @xmath8 via friend edges in @xmath13 .",
    "moreover , given @xmath24 , let @xmath25 denote the total weight of potential edges in @xmath26 and let _ average weight _",
    ", @xmath27 denote the average weight of potential edges connected to each individual in @xmath26 if @xmath28 . ] .",
    "hmgf is formulated as follows .",
    "* problem : hop - bounded maximum group friending ( hmgf ) . *    * given : * social network @xmath1 , hop constraint @xmath29 , and size constraint @xmath30 .",
    "* objective : * find an induced subgraph @xmath24 with the maximum @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    efficient processing of hmgf is very challenging due to the following reasons : 1 ) the interplay of the total weight @xmath25 and the size of @xmath26 . to maximize @xmath31 ,",
    "finding a small @xmath26 may not be a good choice because the number of edges in a small graph tends to be small as well .",
    "on the other hand , finding a large @xmath26 ( which usually has a high @xmath25 ) may not lead to an acceptable @xmath31 , either . therefore",
    ", the key is to strike a good balance between the graph size @xmath34 and the total weight @xmath25 .",
    "2 ) hmgf includes a hop constraint ( say @xmath35 ) on friend edges to ensure that every pair of individuals is not too distant socially from each other .",
    "however , selecting a potential edge @xmath36 $ ] with a large weight @xmath37 $ ] may not necessarily satisfy the hop constraint , i.e. , @xmath38 which is defined based on existing friend edges . in this case",
    ", it may not always be a good strategy to prioritize on large - weight edges in order to maximize @xmath31 , especially when @xmath7 and @xmath8 do not share a common friend nearby via the friend edges .    in the following ,",
    "we prove that hmgf is np - hard and _ not approximable _ within any factor .",
    "in other words , there exists no approximation algorithm for hmgf .",
    "[ thm_np ] hmgf is np - hard and there is no approximation algorithm for hmgf unless @xmath0 .    due to the space constraints , we prove this theorem in the full version of this paper ( available online @xcite ) .",
    "extracting dense subgraphs or social cohesive groups among social networks is a natural way for selecting a set of close friends for a gathering .",
    "various social cohesive measures have been proposed for finding dense social subgraphs , e.g. , diameter @xcite , density @xcite , clique and its variations @xcite .",
    "although these social cohesive measures cover a wide range of application scenarios , they focus on deriving groups based only on existing friendship in the social network . in contrast , the hmgf studied in this paper aims to extract groups by considering both the existing and potential friendships for socialization activities .",
    "therefore , the existing works mentioned above can not be directly applied to hmgf tackled in this paper .",
    "research on finding a set of attendees for activities based on the social tightness among existing friends ycl11,ysl12,zhx14,syy14,sll11 have been reported in the literature .",
    "social - temporal group query @xcite checks the available times of attendees to find the social cohesive group with the most suitable activity time .",
    "geo - social group query @xcite extracts socially tight groups while considering certain spatial properties .",
    "the willingness optimization for social group problem in @xcite selects a set of attendees for an activity while maximizing their willingness to participate .",
    "finally , @xcite finds a set of compatible members with tight social relationships in the collaboration network . although these works find suitable attendees for activities based on existing friendship among the attendees , they ignore the likelihood of making new friends among the attendees .",
    "therefore , these works may not be suitable for socialization activities discussed in this paper .",
    "link prediction analyzes the features , similarity or interaction patterns among individuals in order to recommend possible friends to the users @xcite .",
    "link prediction algorithms employ different approaches including graph - topological features , classification models , hierarchical probabilistic model , and linear algebraic methods .",
    "these works show good prediction accuracy for friend recommendation in social networks . in this paper , to estimate the likelihood of how individuals may potentially become friends in the future , we employ link prediction algorithms for deriving the potential edges among the individuals .    to the best knowledge of the authors",
    ", there exists no algorithm for activity organization that considers both the existing friendship and the likelihood of making new friends when selecting activity attendees .",
    "the hmgf studied in this paper examines the social tightness among existing friends and the likelihood of becoming friends for non - friend attendees .",
    "we envisage that our research result can be employed in various social network applications for activity organization .",
    "we implement hmgf in facebook and invite 50 users to participate in our user study .",
    "each user , given 12 test cases of hmgf using her friends in facebook as the input graph , is asked to solve the hmgf cases , and compare her results with the solutions obtained by maxgf .",
    "in addition to the user study , we evaluate the performance of maxgf on two real social network datasets , i.e. , fb @xcite and the ms dataset from kdd cup 2013 .",
    "the fb dataset is extracted from facebook with 90k vertices , and ms is a co - author network with 1.7 m vertices .",
    "we extract the friend edges from these datasets and identify the potential edges with a link prediction algorithm @xcite .",
    "the weight of a potential edge is ranged within ( 0,1 ] .",
    "moreover , we compare maxgf with two algorithms , namely , baseline and dks @xcite .",
    "baseline finds the optimal solution of hmgf by enumerating all the subgraphs satisfying the constraints , while dks is an @xmath39-approximation algorithm for finding a @xmath30-vertex subgraph @xmath24 with the maximum density on @xmath40 without considering the potential edges and the hop constraint .",
    "the algorithms are implemented in an ibm 3650 server with quadcore intel x5450 3.0 ghz cpus .",
    "we measure 30 samples in each scenario . in the following ,",
    "fearatio and objratio respectively denote the ratio of feasibility ( i.e. , the portion of solutions satisfying the hop constraint ) and the ratio of @xmath41 in the solutions obtained by maxgf or dks to that of the optimal solution .      [ exp_us ]",
    "figure [ exp_us ] presents the results of the user study .",
    "figure us_time compares the required time for users and maxgf to solve the hmgf instances .",
    "users need much more time than maxgf due to challenges brought by the hop constraint and tradeoffs in potential edge weights and the group size , as explained in section [ prob ] . as @xmath42 or @xmath29 grows ,",
    "users need more time because the hmgf cases become more complicated .",
    "figure [ us_ratio ] compares the solution feasibility and quality among users and maxgf .",
    "we employ baseline to obtain the optimal solutions and derive fearatio and objratio accordingly .",
    "the fearatio and objratio of users are low because simultaneously considering both the hop constraint on friend edges and total weights on potential edges is difficult for users .",
    "as shown , users fearatio and objratio drop when @xmath42 increases .",
    "by contrast , maxgf obtains the solutions with high fearatio and objratio . in figure us_satisfaction",
    ", we ask each user to compare her solutions with the solutions obtained by maxgf and dks , to validate the effectiveness of hmgf .",
    "74% of the users agree that the solution of maxgf is the best because hmgf maximizes the likelihood of friend - making while considering the hop constraint on friend edges at the same time .",
    "by contrast , dks finds the solutions with a large number of edges , but it does not differentiate the friend edges and potential edges .",
    "therefore , users believe that the selected individuals may not be able to socialize with each other effectively .",
    "[ exp_baseline ]    baseline can only find the optimal solutions of small hmgf cases since it enumerates all possible solutions .",
    "therefore , we first compare maxgf against baseline and dks on small graphs randomly extracted from fb .",
    "figure [ baseline_time_v ] compares the execution time of the algorithms by varying the size of input graph .",
    "since baseline enumerates all the subgraphs @xmath26 with @xmath32 , the execution time grows exponentially .",
    "the execution time of maxgf is very small because the hop - bounded subgraphs and the pruning strategy effectively trim the search space .",
    "figures baseline_fea_v and [ baseline_obj_v ] present the fearatio and objratio of the algorithms , respectively .",
    "maxgf has high objratio because maxgf iteratively removes vertices with low incident weights from each hop - bounded subgraph @xmath43 , and extracts the solution @xmath44 with maximized @xmath45 among different subgraphs in different @xmath43 to strike a good balance on total edge weights and group sizes as describe in section [ prob ] .",
    "moreover , the high fearatio and objratio also indicate that the post - processing procedure effectively restores the hop constraint and maximizes the average weight accordingly .",
    "by contrast , dks does not consider the hop constraint and different edge types in finding solutions and thus generates the solutions with smaller fearatio and objratio .",
    "[ exp_datasets ]    figures [ baseline_time_h]-(f ) compare execution time , fearatio and objratio again but by varying @xmath29 .",
    "when @xmath29 increases , the execution time of maxgf grows slowly because the pruning strategy avoids examining the hop - bounded subgraphs that do not lead to a better solution .",
    "the fearatio and objratio of maxgf with different @xmath29 are high because maxgf employs hop - bounded subgraphs to avoid generating solutions with large hop distances on friend edges , and the post - processing procedure effectively restores the hop constraint and maximizes the objective function .",
    "figure [ exp_datasets ] compares maxgf in different datasets , i.e. , fb and ms .",
    "figures [ fea_h ] and [ group_h ] present the fearatio and the solution group sizes with different @xmath29 . as @xmath29 increases , maxgf on both datasets achieves a higher fearatio due to the post - processing procedure adjusts @xmath44 and further minimizes @xmath46 .",
    "moreover , it is worth noting that the returned group sizes grow when @xmath29 increases in ms .",
    "this is because ms contains large densely connected components with large edge weights .",
    "when @xmath29 is larger , maxgf is inclined to extract larger groups from these components to maximize the objective function . by contrast , fb does not have large components and maxgf thereby tends to find small groups to reduce the group size for maximizing the objective function .",
    "in fact , the solutions in fb are almost the same with different @xmath29 .",
    "finally , maxgf needs to carefully examine possible solutions with the sizes at least @xmath30 , and thus figure [ time_p ] shows that when @xmath30 increases , the execution time drops because maxgf effectively avoids examining the candidate solutions with small group sizes .",
    "to bridge the gap between the state - of - the - art activity organization and friend recommendation in osns , in this paper , we propose to model the individuals with existing and potential friendships in osns for friend - making activity organization .",
    "we formulate a new research problem , namely , hop - bonded maximum group friending ( hmgf ) , to find suitable activity attendees .",
    "we prove that hmgf is np - hard and there exists no approximation algorithms unless @xmath0 .",
    "we then propose an approximation algorithm with guaranteed error bound , i.e. , maxgf , to find good solutions efficiently .",
