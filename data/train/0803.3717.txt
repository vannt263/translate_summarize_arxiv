    "mathematical models for the dynamics of transcriptional regulation are traditionally formulated either in terms of ordinary differential equations @xcite , or by purely stochastic models , based on master equations @xcite or by using the gillespie algorithm @xcite .",
    "both the deterministic and stochastic descriptions average out spatial degrees of freedom and hence are more similar to each other than is often acknowledged . in recent years",
    ", a discussion has started on the effect of stochasticity on gene regulatory processes ; exemplary studies are @xcite . indeed , already",
    "the fact that molecules involved in regulatory processes often exist only in small copy numbers can be significant for the dynamics of a given regulatory circuit , and stochastic effects like bursting may have an important role for cellular function @xcite .",
    "models of regulatory dynamics suffer also from another problem which is the lack of precise knowledge of reaction rates .",
    "building dynamic models for a large number of network elements can induce further arbitrariness due to a lack of detailed knowledge of the interaction mechanisms involved .",
    "approaches that aim to describe larger networks are often deliberately reductionist to become computationally tractable ( see , e.g. , @xcite , building on pioneering work by glass , kauffman and thomas @xcite ) , and the result of such computations can then only be called `` qualitative '' .",
    "the effect of these reduction schemes , which within a physics - based notion could also be subsumed under the notion of  coarse - graining \" , therefore often lacks clarity as to what effect the approximations / simplifications have , since a general systematics is not available ( an exemplary discussion of this issue can be found in @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of what effect such a reduction scheme has on the dynamics of a given regulatory network in a systematic way . for this",
    "we start from a minimal model description for transcriptional regulatory networks which coarse grains as many regulatory layers as possible ( although they could of course be added back in later ) .",
    "we note that this modeling philosopy is in contrast to the usual way models of transcriptional regulation are built in which first all avaliable biochemical detail is considered and then reduced by way of approximation ( as , e.g. , in @xcite and many other similar examples ) .",
    "we then formulate both a deterministic ( mean - field ) version and a stochastic version of the transcriptional dynamics .",
    "this approach allows us to study the dynamics of basically all fundamental classes of transcriptional networks relevant for prokaryotic organisms , although we only look at few - gene networks in detail here .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we first develop the kinetic reactions involved in transcriptional regulation .",
    "subsequently , we formulate the corresponding deterministic and stochastic versions of the dynamics .",
    "a separate section of the paper is devoted to the application of both schemes to commonly encountered regulatory motifs @xcite .",
    "two examples are presented in more detail since they display richer structure : the repressilator , a three - gene network of inhibiting gates which acts as a genetic clock , previously realized experimentally in _",
    "@xcite , and a regulatory motif with multiple inputs which was recently proposed to be relevant for regulatory processes in development @xcite .",
    "for all these systems , we compare the results of the deterministic calculations and their stochastic counterparts and evaluate the role different regulatory mechanisms play for the observed outcome .",
    "our minimal model for transcriptional regulation consists in the definition of a computational element for each regulatory element ( i.e. , transcribing gene ) , which we call a gene gate .",
    "the basic possible types of gene gates are sketched in figure 1 .",
    "each gene gate is defined via its reaction kinetics .",
    "the ` null gate ' in figure 1.1 is a gene in a state @xmath0 which produces a protein output @xmath1 at a rate @xmath2 , hence the kinetic reaction is written as @xmath3 the protein output can be degraded according to the reaction @xmath4 in an abbreviating notation we call this gate element @xmath5 where inputs and outputs are separated by the semicolon .    in the next step",
    "we add a regulatory input to the null gate .",
    "figure 1.2 shows the resulting ` neg gate ' in which a transcription factor @xmath6 inhibits the production of protein @xmath1 upon binding .",
    "this is represented by the reaction @xmath7 this reaction corresponds to the formation of a transcription factor - dna complex with zero lifetime ; such an intermediate with a finite lifetime can of course be introduced as well but is not necessary for a minimal model of gene networks .",
    "after this interaction , the gene in state @xmath8 is blocked in transcription / translation . in order to allow transcription again the gate has to relax from its blocked state to its original transcribing state at a rate @xmath9 , @xmath10 to the state @xmath0 in which transcription at a basal rate @xmath2 can occur .",
    "we call this gate the @xmath11-gate .",
    "the relaxation process from @xmath8 to @xmath0 models the fact that a gene generally is not transcribed immediately after the break - up of a transcription factor - dna complex ; also note that within our minimal model of the gene gate , transcription and translation are lumped together .",
    "likewise we can model the activation of a gene upon binding of a transcription factor ; figure 1.3 shows the ` pos gate ' .",
    "the binding reaction is identical , but the gene in state @xmath8 now behaves according to @xmath12 where the rate @xmath13 , i.e. the transcription / translation rate upon activation is larger than the basal rate .",
    "this is the @xmath14-gate .",
    "finally , figure 1.4 shows a gate with multiple regulations which is in fact a commonly encountered situation , see , e.g. , the _",
    "e. coli _ network of transcriptional interactions reconstructed in @xcite .",
    "for the @xmath15-gate we have to consider three gene states , @xmath0 , @xmath8 , and @xmath16 with the reactions @xmath17 @xmath18 and the correponding relaxation reactions @xmath19 @xmath20 it is clear from this scheme that for each additional regulatory function , a binding transcription factor and a corresponding gene state have to be introduced .",
    "our minimal model obviously leaves out a number of regulatory levels such as    * complexation of transcription factors ; * formation of the dna - transcription factor complex ; * dna transcription and rna translation are lumped together .",
    "these regulatory mechanisms can , of course , be added to the list of reactions given above , and we will come back to this issue in the course of this paper .      having listed the transcriptional reactions we now define a continuum description based on ordinary differential equations for the concentration of genes and proteins .",
    "we assume that the cell population can be considered as a ` soup ' containing the proteins as well as @xmath21 copies of the gene @xmath0 .",
    "we denote normalized concentrations by small letters @xmath22/n$ ] , @xmath23/n $ ] with @xmath24 \\equiv \\#g / v $ ] ( likewise for @xmath25 $ ] ) and keep the previous symbols for the kinetic constants ( i.e. , we include dependencies on cell volume @xmath26 and gene copy number @xmath21 where necessary ; the difference to the kinetic reactions should be evident from the context ) .",
    "the two reactions of the null gate are then summarized by the ode @xmath27 for the regulated genes , an equation for @xmath28 has to be added . since the @xmath21 gene gates present in our cell model have to be either in state @xmath0 or @xmath8 , one has the conservation law @xmath29 + [ g ' ] = n$ ] . from the normalization we have @xmath30 , and hence the _ neg_-gate",
    "is described by the two odes , eq.([eqb ] ) , and @xmath31 where the conservation condition has been used , and @xmath32 .",
    "the _ pos_-gate ( figure 1.3 ) is governed by the ode s eq.([eqg ] ) and @xmath33 finally , we consider the case of multiple regulations of a single gene , the simplest multi - input gate , the _ posneg_-gate of figure 1.4 with the three gene states , @xmath0 , @xmath8 and @xmath16 , modifying the conservation condition to @xmath34 .",
    "we can build up the gate reaction kinetics as before and obtain the system of ode s @xmath35 and @xmath36 @xmath37 hence one has for @xmath28 the equation @xmath38 which follows from the conservation of gene states .    at this point",
    "we stress that we have only considered the case of binding of a single protein @xmath6 . in general",
    ", the binding of proteins is rather by multi - protein complexes ( dimers or higher ) , which is one way to give rise to a hill coefficient @xmath39 when the complexation reaction is considered an equilibrium (  fast \" ) reaction @xcite .",
    "we could take this into account in our model by adding a corresponding complexation reaction in the reaction scheme . to be practical we here",
    "directly modify the ode equation of the gene by replacing @xmath40 by @xmath41 with @xmath42 to cover this more general case ; in what follows , we consider @xmath39 as a continously variable parameter .",
    "it is well - known that a hill exponent @xmath43 is essential for the dynamic behaviour of simple gene circuits @xcite .    for the stochastic simulations we employ the gillespie algorithm which is equivalent to the chemical master equation @xcite .",
    "we combine the gillespie method with the stochastic @xmath44-calculus , a process algebra originating in theoretical computer science @xcite . for a brief introduction into the main ideas of the calculus ,",
    "see appendix a.",
    "we first discuss the elementary gene circuits that can be built from the above constructs .",
    "all simple transcriptional networks are either circular , linear or mixed circuits , see figure 2 .",
    "the archetypal loops are the autoinhibitory and autoactivatory loops .",
    "the autoinhibitory loop @xmath45 is shown in fig 2.1 .",
    "the ode s governing its dynamics are @xmath46 and @xmath47 the natural first task is to look at nullclines and fixed - points .",
    "the nullcline of @xmath28 is determined by @xmath48 if we have @xmath49 and @xmath50 finite we can keep the circuit near the nullcline of @xmath28 . inserting the nullcline condition into the equation for @xmath51 we find @xmath52 which is the common form of the hill - type equation used in nonlinear dynamics descriptions of gene networks .",
    "this turns out to be a general feature of the gene gate approach : near the nullclines of the gene gate states , @xmath53 , the circuit dynamics reduces to that of the standard hill equations .",
    "this feature has an immediate consequence for the fixed points .",
    "the nuclline of @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 where the result for @xmath28 has been used , and we thus find the standard fixed - point condition of the hill equation for @xmath51 . since the left - hand side is a hyperbolic function in @xmath51 , and the right - hand side is a linear function there is a unique fixed - point of the circuit .",
    "the argument can be repeated for the autoactivatory loop @xmath56 with the result @xmath57 which is the typical sigmoidal form of the activatory circuit .",
    "therefore , we again find that the fixed - points are given by a conditions akin to the standard hill - type equations , which for @xmath58 gives rise to three fixed - points .",
    "the stability of the fixed - points in the gene networks is not affected by the presence of the genes .",
    "we illustrate this for the bistable circuit composed of two neg - gtaes , @xmath59 , where the symbol @xmath60 denotes the composition of two gates , see figure 2.1 .",
    "the equations of th circuit read as @xmath61 and @xmath62 and likewise for @xmath63 . as is well known @xcite , the nonlinearity due to the hill coefficient is needed for the system in order to display the fixed - point structure of the bistable switch ; for a value of @xmath64 as in our basic version of the gene gate model this is not the case .",
    "the stability of the fixed - points follows from the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath65 with @xmath66 note that we are looking here at the stability of the _ symmetric _ fixed - point for which @xmath67 , @xmath68 . for the bistable switch ,",
    "this is the unstable fixed - point intervening between the two stable fixed - points , and its eigenvalues follow from the characteristic polynomial to @xmath69 , @xmath70 taking the root of this equation , one finds four real eigenvalues , two of which are negative , and two positive .",
    "the picture that emerges therefore is the usual instability in the space of protein concentrations @xmath71 , while the genes do not contribute .",
    "we close this subsection by commenting on results from the stochastic simulations .",
    "the basic loop- and linear circuits ( negative , positive ) show fixed - point behaviour similar to their deterministic counterparts @xcite . for the bistable switch there is a notable difference : as was recently shown based on a master equation approach the stochastic dynamics of the bistable switch without cooperativity ( @xmath72 ) displays both bistability and switching @xcite . this behaviour is easily reproduced with our gillespie approach , see figure 3 .",
    "= 1 , @xmath2 = 0.4 , @xmath9= 0.2 , @xmath73 = 5 @xmath74 .",
    "the insert indicates output on the @xmath44-calculus channels @xmath75 , @xmath76 , equivalent to protein numbers.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    before moving on to richer examples , we draw a brief intermediate conclusion for the gene gate model :    * if the deterministic gene circuit has a unique stable fixed - point , the genes are ` irrelevant ' variables in the sense that they do not alter the location of the fixed point .",
    "they do , however , affect the transient dynamics ( see below ) ; * the deterministic dynamics requires hill - type nonlinearity in order to show bistability and switching ; for the stochastic dynamics , cooperativity is not needed .",
    "clearly , the dynamics of the genes does affect the systems transients , and as such the genes can indeed have a profound influence on the dynamics , as we now show .",
    "for this we look at a gene circuit whose stationary behaviour is not governed by a simple fixed - point , but by a limit cycle : the repressilator .",
    "the repressilator is the three - gene negative - feedback loop shown in figure 2.1 ; this system has been realized experimentally as a synthetic gene circuit in _",
    "@xcite , and it has recently been the topic of various modeling papers , employing both deterministic and stochastic approaches , e.g. , @xcite .",

    "the stability analysis of this fixed - point can be carried out analytically for the full gene gate circuit , i.e. keeping both the transcription factors and the three genes as dynamic variables . by symmetry ,",

    "the triangle is somewhat ` fuzzy ' , reflecting the fluctuating nature of the concentrations .",
    "this fuzziness can be reduced by increasing the space of variables in the system . in a recent study ,",
    "the effect of an inclusion of transcription factor cooperativity ( dimerization and higher ) , or an inclusion of explicit rna transcription and protein translation was studied .",
    "it was found that all these mechanisms regularize the oscillatory behaviour @xcite and render the limit cycle less ` fuzzy ' .",

    "the stability condition can be read off , as before , from the stability matrix which now reads as @xmath112 with @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 @xmath116 note that @xmath117 can be both positive and negative .",
    "the characteristic polynomial reads @xmath118 which still has a pair of complex eigenvalues .",
    "the hopf condition is given by @xmath119    the analysis of the full system , genes included , is clearly more involved than for the repressilator due to the increased number of variables .",
    "we have therefore studied the system only numerically and compared the reduced and the full version , as we did for the repressilator .",
    "our calcuations show that the reduced version ( 3 ode s for @xmath51,@xmath78,@xmath79 ) is less robust against rewiring than the gene gate version ( 7 ode s ) : the stability limit of the limit cycle regime can differ by parameter values up to one order of magnitude .",
    "this finding is notable since in the presence of multiple regulations the number of gene states increases linearly with the number of inputs ( neglecting still additional regulatory layers ) and thus significantly enhances the complexity in modeling circuits with such elements .",
    "we close the section with figure 7 ( bottom ) which shows the limit cyle of the rewired repressilator for the reduced deterministic system ( @xmath120 ) .",
    "it illustrates that in general the presence of the additional positive loop breaks the ( @xmath121 ) symmetry between concentrations .      in this final subsection",
    "we address a second example of a multi - input gate .",
    "it consists of a bistable switch built from two repressing gates which is placed under additional control by an activating input .",
    "such motifs occur both in transcriptional regulation @xcite , but they have also been proposed recently to play a role in morphogen concentration - dependent cellular development @xcite ; our example is motivated by the latter case .",
    "the circuit dynamics is governed by the following ode s ( neglecting the gene gate dynamics since we are concerned with fixed - point dynamics only ) @xmath122 where @xmath123 are the different hill exponents . if the activating variable @xmath124 , the system is the standard bistable switch , albeit asymmetric with respect to the parameters and nonlinearities , and it is this asymmetry which plays an important role - in ref .",
    "@xcite , the supposed hill coefficients have values of 3 and 6 , respectively .",
    "the effect of the variable @xmath51 has on the dynamics is easily understood . to simplify matters",
    ", we neglect @xmath51 in the first equation and look at an asymmetric wiring .",
    "it actually does not matter whether we allow @xmath51 to control one or both transcription factors @xmath125 as long as @xmath51 interacts with both in the same way and not via a different nonlinearity : the main symmetry - breaking effect is contained in the difference between the hill coefficients controlling @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "supposing further that we increase the concentration of @xmath51 to levels where it dominates the concentration @xmath78 so that we have for the fixed - point in @xmath79 @xmath126 thus , the fixed - point concentration of the repressing variable @xmath127 is locked to that of @xmath51 and approaches an asymptotically constant value . correspondingly , this brings the fixed - point level of @xmath78 down and under firm control of @xmath51 : the system ceases to be bistable , and locks into a stable state under control of @xmath128 .",
    "the possible relevance of this mechanism for a transcriptional circuit in development is evident : increasing @xmath51 can force the system to switch in a concentration - dependent way .    in the nonlinear dynamics case , this switch is therefore brought about by the vanishing of a fixed - point ; again , this situation is different in the stochastic setting . for comparison , figures 8 and 9 show our results of the stochastic simulations for the circuit @xmath129 without any cooperative nonlinearity , as for the repressilator .    .",

    "in conclusion we have proposed a minimal model description for gene regulatory networks based on the notion of the gene gate , first proposed in ref .",
    "we studied the dynamics of simple gene networks in both a mean - field and a stochastic version , with characteristically different results :    * if the system dynamics is stable fixed - point only , a reduced deterministic description ignoring the degree of freedom of the gates is sufficient in the sense that the fixed - point is not altered by the presence of the genes .",
    "but if this is the case , the latter are indeed ` irrelevant ' . in order to represent faithfully the fixed - point structure of the network ,",
    "a hill - type nonlinearity may be needed ( like for the bistable switch circuit ) .",
    "however , within a stochastic description fluctuation effects induced by the genes ( promoters ) might affect fixed - point locations @xcite , or the stability of bistable switches @xcite . *",
    "if the system displays a limit cyle , the gene gates are relevant , as is any other additional regulatory layer to determine the parameter range of oscillations .",
    "in general the limit cycle regimes depends on the whole set of parameter values , hill coefficient included . in particular",
    "this means that in multi - input regulations in which additional gene states have to be accounted for , the parameter space can extend significantly .",
    "* if the system dynamics is fixed - point , the stochastic version obeys this without any need for cooperative effects .",
    "the same holds true for limit cyle behaviour .",
    "additional regulatory layers also enlarge the phase space but in a trivial way .",
    "by contrast , they affect oscillatory behaviour by regularizing the oscillations .    in our view these results have interesting consequences on the philosphy of modeling gene regulatory networks in suggesting a different coarse - approach .",
    "computational models of large networks can be built by abstracting away all regulatory layers to a level where the remaining network can still faithfully represent the system characteristics .",
    "network motifs that have a more sensitive dynamic behaviour - like limit cycles , as shown here - are more sensitive to modeling assumptions .",

    "<S> we introduce a minimal model description for the dynamics of transcriptional regulatory networks . it is studied within a mean - field approximation , i.e. , by deterministic ode s representing the reaction kinetics , and by stochastic simulations employing the gillespie algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate the different results both approaches can deliver , depending on the network under study , and in particular depending on the level of detail retained in the respective description . </S>",
    "<S> two examples are addressed in detail : the repressilator , a transcriptional clock based on a three - gene network realized experimentally in _ e. coli _ , and a bistable two - gene circuit under external driving , a transcriptional network motif recently proposed to play a role in cellular development . </S>"
