    "we consider the preparation of pure gaussian states via an open - system approach .",
    "the main idea is that by engineering coherent and dissipative processes , a quantum system can be made strictly stable and will evolve into a given pure gaussian state .",
    "this approach is known as _ reservoir engineering _",
    "it is an efficient and robust approach to driving a quantum system into a desired target quantum state . in the finite - dimensional case ,",
    "the problem of pure quantum state stabilization by reservoir engineering has been studied theoretically in  @xcite . in the infinite - dimensional case ,",
    "the problem of preparing a pure gaussian state via reservoir engineering has recently been explored in  @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the preparation of pure gaussian states via reservoir engineering .",
    "we consider an open quantum system , the time evolution of which is governed by a markovian lindblad master equation  @xcite : @xmath1                  + \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{k}\\left (                         \\hat{c}_{j}\\hat{\\rho } \\hat{c}_{j}^ *                              -\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{c}_{j}^*\\hat{c}_{j}\\hat{\\rho }                                   -\\frac{1}{2}\\hat{\\rho } \\hat{c}_{j}^*\\hat{c}_{j}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the density operator , @xmath3 is the hamiltonian operator , @xmath4 is a set of lindblad operators that represent the coupling of the system with its environment , and @xmath5 is the number of dissipative channels . for convenience , we collect all of the lindblad operators into a vector @xmath6^{\\top}$ ] , and we call @xmath7 the _ coupling vector_. the lindblad master equation   can typically be derived if the system is coupled weakly to a very large environment  @xcite . under some circumstances ,",
    "the evolution described by the lindblad master equation   will be strictly stable and will approach a time - independent ( stationary ) state , i.e. , @xmath8 . based on this fact",
    ", it has been shown in  @xcite that any pure gaussian state can be prepared in a dissipative quantum system by engineering a suitable pair of operators @xmath9 . using the result developed in  @xcite",
    ", it has been found that for many pure gaussian states , the quantum systems generating them can be difficult to implement experimentally , mainly because either the hamiltonian @xmath10 or the coupling vector @xmath7 has a nonlocal coupling structure .    in this paper",
    ", we restrict our attention to a chain of @xmath0 quantum harmonic oscillators which are numbered from left to right as @xmath11 with nearest - neighbour hamiltonian interactions .",

    "more specifically , the quantum harmonic oscillator chain we consider has two crucial features .",

    "( ) only the central ( i.e. , the @xmath17th ) oscillator of the chain is coupled to the reservoir .",
    "that is , the coupling vector @xmath7 reduces to a single lindblad operator which is of the form @xmath18 , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "a quantum harmonic oscillator chain subject to the above two constraints should be relatively easy to implement experimentally .",
    "we then develop an exhaustive parametrization of all those pure gaussian states that can be prepared by this type of quantum harmonic oscillator chain .",
    "this parametrization allows us to determine the entanglement properties of the corresponding pure gaussian states .",
    "for example , for the quantum chain considered in  @xcite , oscillators located at equal distances , on the left and right , from the central one are entangled in pairs . however , using the parametrization developed in this paper , we can find pure gaussian states for which any two oscillators ( except the central oscillator ) in the chain are entangled .",
    "note that a chain structure of quantum harmonic oscillators has also been studied in , e.g. ,   @xcite .",
    "it is worth remarking that although in this paper , we only consider the case where the chain has an odd number of quantum harmonic oscillators , the method developed here can be easily extended to handle the case where the number of the oscillators is even , as we have previously done in  @xcite .",
    "the method developed in this paper can also be easily extended to handle the case where the reservoir acts locally on an arbitrary oscillator in the chain ( not necessarily the central one ) .",
    "the parametrizations of pure gaussian steady states in these cases involve a similar method of analysis to the method here , and hence are omitted .",

    "this characterization is formulated as a theorem . to make the result more accessible to the reader",
    ", we also provide an equivalent algorithm in section  [ algorithm ] for finding such pure gaussian states . applying the algorithm generates pure gaussian state covariance matrices .",
