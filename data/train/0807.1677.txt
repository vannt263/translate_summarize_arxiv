    "we are interested in knowing what type of manifolds are obtained by doing dehn surgery on closed pure 3-braids in @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , when is possible to obtain the 3-sphere by dehn surgery on a closed pure 3-braid .    by the fundamental theorem of surgery proved by lickorish and wallace @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , we know that any closed , connected and oriented 3-manifold can be obtained by integral dehn surgery on a closed pure @xmath10-braid . it is known that surgery on a closed pure 1-braid produces lens spaces , for such a braid is the trivial knot ; some surgeries on closed pure 2-braids produce connected sums of lens spaces , but in general they produce seifert fibered spaces , for a closed pure @xmath11-braid is a torus link .",
    "so , it is a natural question to ask what kind of 3-manifolds are obtained by surgery on closed pure 3-braids .    by @xcite",
    "we have that the group of pure 3-braids can be seen as the direct product of two free groups @xmath12 .",
    "so the group of pure @xmath0-braids can be expressed as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are integers .",
    "denote by @xmath16 the closure of the braid @xmath17 .    in this work we consider the closed 3-braids of the form @xmath18 , shown in figure 1 , where the boxes indicate the number of full twist given to the braid .",
    "we call these links _ small _ closed pure 3-braids .",
    "we determine when an integral surgery in such a link produces the 3-sphere .    in a previous work @xcite , we considered closed pure 3-braids @xmath16 of the form @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and showed that in many cases we obtain a haken or a laminar manifold by surgery on such links .",
    "the first author @xcite has shown an example of a hyperbolic small closed pure @xmath0-braid which do have a nontrivial surgery producing @xmath1 , which is recovered in the present paper .",
    "note that the link @xmath16 which is the closure of the braid @xmath23 , can be obtained by @xmath24-dehn surgery on the link @xmath9 shown in figure 2 .",
    "it is known that this link is hyperbolic , and in fact arithmetic @xcite .",
    "so our problem is equivalent to determine when surgery on this link produces the 3-sphere , though we consider integral surgery on 3 components of the link and integral reciprocal in the other 3 components .",
    "we indicate surgeries on this link by @xmath25 , as indicated in figure 2 , which implicitly is giving an order to the components of the link .",
    "note that the link @xmath9 is strongly invertible , an involution axis is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the quotient of the exterior of @xmath9 under this involution will be a punctured @xmath1 , together with arcs , formed by the image of the involution axis .",
    "more precisely , following @xcite , a _ tangle _ will be a pair @xmath26 where @xmath27 is @xmath1 with the interiors of a finite number ( @xmath28 ) of disjoint 3-balls removed , and @xmath29 is a disjoint union of properly embedded arcs in @xmath27 such that @xmath29 meets each component of @xmath30 in exactly four points .",
    "two tangles @xmath31 and @xmath32 are homeomorphic if there is a homeomorphism of pairs @xmath33 .",
    "a _ marking _ of a tangle @xmath26 is an identification of each pair @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a component of @xmath30 , with @xmath36 .",
    "a _ marked _ tangle is a tangle together with a marking .",
    "we say that a homeomorphism preserves a marking if the axis @xmath37 is mapped to one of the axes @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 or @xmath40 , and the other axes are mapped accordingly .",
    "two marked tangles are equivalent if they are homeomorphic by an orientation preserving homeomorphism that preserves the markings .",
    "a _ rational _ tangle is a marked tangle that is homeomorphic to the trivial tangle in the 3-ball , @xmath41 .",
    "as marked tangles , rational tangles are parameterized by @xmath42 .",
    "we denote the rational tangle corresponding to @xmath43 by @xmath44 , and adopt the conventions of @xcite . given a marked tangle , there is a well defined way of filling its boundary components with rational tangles .",
    "so , the quotient of @xmath9 under the involution is a tangle ( see figure 3 ) , where its boundary components come from the tori boundary components of the exterior of @xmath9 , and the arcs are the image of the involution axis .",
    "this tangle could have a natural marking , if we choose it as given by the image of a framing on the components of @xmath9 , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "instead we choose a marking as in figure 4 .",
    "this is indicated in figure 4 by a rectangular box , where the short sides of the rectangle represent the axis @xmath45 and @xmath46 , and the long sides represent the axis @xmath37 and @xmath39 . in all of our pictures the shape of the rectangle will be always clear .",
    "we call this marked tangle the _ hexatangle _ , and denote it by @xmath47 , or @xmath48 . the capital letters @xmath49 denote boundary components in the hexatangle , and @xmath50 denote fillings of the hexatangle with rational tangles , so for example , @xmath51 denote the tangle obtained by filing the components @xmath29 , @xmath27 and @xmath52 with the rational tangles @xmath53 , @xmath17 and @xmath54 respectively .",
    "we call the sphere boundary components of @xmath47 , filled or unfilled , simply boxes .",
    "we say that two boxes are adjacent if there is an arc of @xmath47 connecting them , and opposite otherwise .",
    "so each box is opposite to just one box and adjacent to 4 boxes .",
    "we consider @xmath50 as rational parameters , so that when @xmath55 , we mean that we are filling the corresponding box with the integral tangle @xmath56 .",
    "note that when we fill the boxes with integral tangles , we are just replacing each box with a sequence of horizontal crossings .",
    "we remark that the hexatangle is the same as conway s basic polyhedra @xmath57 and @xmath58 , but with different marking @xcite , @xcite .",
    "note that by filling one of the components @xmath29 , @xmath27 , @xmath59 , with a rational tangle @xmath60 will correspond in the double branched cover , to do @xmath61-dehn surgery on the corresponding component , while filling with @xmath60 in one of the components @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath52 , will correspond in the double branched cover , to do @xmath64-dehn surgery in the corresponding component ( see @xcite ) , this because of our rational tangles convention ( see @xcite ) .",
    "so we can consider integral fillings in all boundary components of the hexatangle and forget the correspondence with the components of @xmath9 .",
    "remember that the 3-sphere double branch covers only the trivial knot , by the solution of the smith conjecture .",
    "so , our original problem about surgery on small closed pure 3-braids translate to the following :    _ when is it possible to get a trivial knot by filling the hexatangle with integral tangles ? _    the same question could be asked for any fillings , i.e. , when the trivial knot is obtained by rational fillings of the hexatangle ? determining this is equivalent to determining all dehn surgeries on the link @xmath9 that produce the 3-sphere .",
    "we plan to study this problem in a subsequent paper .",
    "this problem is interesting by itself but also for several other reasons .",
    "lots of hyperbolic manifolds of small volume are obtained by doing surgery on some components of @xmath9 , for example , by doing @xmath65-surgery on any component of @xmath8 , we get a link whose exterior is isometric to the exterior of the minimally .",
    "also , the pentangle which is studied in @xcite , is obtained by putting @xmath66 in the hexatangle .",
    "the so called `` magic manifold '' , which is the exterior of the 3-chain link studied in @xcite , is also obtained by dehn surgery on @xmath9 .",
    "in fact , the 3-chain link is the closure the pure 3-braid @xmath67 . in @xcite",
    "all the exceptional fillings of the 3-chain link are determined ; these results can be verified by looking at the corresponding fillings of the hexatangle .",
    "it would be also interesting to determine all exceptional fillings of the link @xmath9 .",
    "d. futer and j.s .",
    "purcell @xcite have shown that if a link @xmath68 has a prime , twist - reduced diagram @xmath69 , with at least two twist regions and each twist region containing at least 6 crossings , then @xmath68 is hyperbolic .",
    "this implies that by filling the hexatangle with integral tangles , each in absolute value greater or equal to 6 , then we get hyperbolic links , in particular the trivial knot is not obtained . here we give a sharp result for the hexatangle , showing exactly when we get the trivial knot .",
    "it would also be interesting to determine when a non - hyperbolic link is obtained from the hexatangle .",
    "another reason why it is interesting to determine when we get the trivial knot by filling the hexatangle , is that if a certain filling produce the trivial knot , then by filling all the components except one , we get a 2-string tangle whose double branched cover is the exterior of a knot in @xmath1 , or in other words , by doing surgery on the corresponding five components of @xmath9 , we get the exterior of a knot in @xmath1 . by experimentation",
    ", we can see that many of those knots are hyperbolic and have non - hyperbolic surgeries , in fact , seifert fibered space surgeries .",
    "many of the examples that we know of hyperbolic strongly invertible knots with a seifert fibered surgery , come from surgery on @xmath8 , ref .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "so , by solving the problem about the hexatangle we could get an interesting list of hyperbolic strongly invertible knots with a seifert fibered space surgery .",
    "however , we can not expect to find all hyperbolic strongly invertible knots with a seifert fibered space in this way , for the volume of a knot with a lens space surgery can be arbitrarily large @xcite , while the volume of any hyperbolic knot obtained by surgery on @xmath8 is bounded .",
    "we remark that there are hyperbolic non - strongly invertible knots with seifert fibered surgeries @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",
    "also , many examples of hyperbolic manifolds with exceptional fillings constructed via tangles , are special cases of the hexatangle ( ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the hexatangle has many symmetries .",
    "note that the hexatangle can be embedded in a tetrahedron , so that each box is in correspondence with an edge of the tetrahedron , as shown in figure 5 .",
    "so any symmetry of the tetrahedron will give a symmetry of the hexatangle preserving framings .",
    "we give a list of fillings on the hexatangle that produces that produces the trivial knot up to symmetries , where by this we mean that the list is complete up to the symmetries given by the tetrahedron and mirror images .",
    "note that given any two boxes , there is a symmetry that takes one to the other . also , given two pairs of adjacent ( opposite ) boxes",
    "there is a symmetry that takes one pair to the other .",
    "our results are the following :    [ thm : main ] suppose an integral filling of the hexatangle produces the trivial knot , then the parameters are exactly as shown in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , up to symmetries .",
    "this will follows from the following results .",
    "[ thm : c-0 ] suppose that one of the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath17 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath54 , say @xmath54 is the tangle @xmath73 .",
    "then @xmath74 is the trivial knot if and only the parameters are as in tables 1 and 2 , up to symmetries .",
    "[ thm : quasi - main ] suppose that all of @xmath53 , @xmath17 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath54 are different from @xmath73 .",
    "if @xmath75 is the trivial knot , then there is a pair of adjacent boxes , say @xmath71 and @xmath54 , so that @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "[ thm : c-1 ] suppose that @xmath53 , @xmath17 , @xmath70 and @xmath72 are not @xmath73 , @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "then @xmath78 is the trivial knot if and only the parameters are as in table 3 , up to symmetries .",
    "theorems [ thm : c-0 ] and [ thm : c-1 ] are just a rational tangles computation ; this is carried out in sections 2 and 3 , respectively .",
    "section 4 is dedicated to a proof of theorem [ thm : quasi - main ] ; this is the main part of the paper .",
    "first , we apply some deep results on dehn surgery on knots to reduce the theorem to six cases , in which there are two small boxes ( lemma [ le:6c ] )",
    ". then an analysis is made of each of the cases , to conclude that the trivial knot can not be obtained , except in one of the cases . in section 5",
    "we discuss about surgery on closed pure 3-braid producing @xmath1 , and show that there are infinitely many hyperbolic small closed pure 3-braid with a nontrivial surgery producing the 3-sphere .",
    "in this and next section we do some rational tangles computations and rely on known facts about rational tangles and knots . we follow the conventions of @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath44 the rational tangle determined by @xmath79 , and by @xmath80 the rational knot or 2-bridge knot , which is the numerator of the rational tangle @xmath44 . as usual",
    ", the numerator of a rational tangle is obtained by closing it with two arcs , one arc joining the points nw - ne , and the other the points sw - se , without introducing new crossing .",
    "a rational tangle @xmath44 can be given by a sequence of integers @xmath81 $ ] whose continued fraction gives @xmath79 , i.e. @xmath82 ; in this case @xmath83 $ ] denotes the tangle @xmath44 and @xmath84 $ ] denotes the numerator of such tangle .",
    "if @xmath80 is the trivial knot , and @xmath85 , @xmath86 are relative primes , then @xmath87 . also note that if @xmath79 is obtained from a continued fraction , then in fact @xmath85 and @xmath86 are relative primes .",
    "a montesinos tangle @xmath88 is a tangle formed by a horizontal strand of rational tangles , and a montesinos link @xmath89 is the numerator of a montesinos tangle .",
    "the double cover of @xmath90 branched along a montesinos tangle @xmath88 is a seifert fibered space @xmath91 over the disk with at most @xmath10-cone points of index @xmath92 .",
    "the double cover of @xmath1 branched along @xmath89 is a seifert fibered space over the sphere @xmath93 with at most @xmath10-cone points of index @xmath92 .",
    "so , if @xmath94 is a trivial knot , one of the tangles @xmath95 is an integral tangle , so that it can be inserted into one of the other rational tangles , getting a montesinos knot formed by two tangles , that is , a 2-bridge knot .",
    "note also that if @xmath94 is a composite link , then one of the tangles @xmath95 is the rational tangle @xmath96 . finally note that if the trivial knot is presented as a sum of two 2-strings tangles , then at least one of the tangles must be a trivial tangle . in what follows we use the words knot and link interchangeably , to mean a collection of circles , except when referring to the trivial knot , which always will consist of a single component .    in this section",
    "we prove the following ,    * theorem 1.2 *  _ suppose that one of the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath17 @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath54 , say @xmath54 is the tangle @xmath73",

    "_    * proof * the proof is a rational tangles calculation . note that if 4 or more of the parameters are @xmath73 , then the link obtained has more than one component .",
    "so suppose at most 3 of the parameters are @xmath73 .",

    "all other possible cases would produce a link of several components .",
