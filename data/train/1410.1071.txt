    "amorphous solids are of interest for a large number of technological applications , ranging from optical lenses and waveguides ( oxides ) , to plastics ( organic polymers ) , solar cells ( semiconductors ) , xerography and non - volatile memory devices ( chalcogenides ) @xcite .",
    "the determination of the atomistic structure of amorphous and glassy materials is , however , still a major challenge as the lack of long range order prevents a full structural characterization from scattering data @xcite .",
    "modeling is therefore particularly useful in resolving the structure of amorphous materials .",
    "reverse monte carlo ( rmc ) @xcite for instance , is a rather popular technique to generate models that are in very good agreement with experimental scattering and diffraction data . while this allows for an efficient and routine modeling of rather complex disordered structures ,",
    "the resulting models are not necessarily physical sensible .",
    "furthermore , since no information on the potential energy surface is exploited , a variety of different structural models that are very different from each other , but in similarly good agreement with experiment , can be generated @xcite .",
    "finite temperature molecular dynamics ( md ) or monte carlo ( mc ) simulations offer an alternative route to generate glassy models by quenching from the melt using the simulated annealing ( sa ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "however , due to the large number of degrees of freedom of disordered systems , the annealing has to be conducted as slowly as possible and is therefore computationally exceedingly expensive .",
    "this is even more pronounced in conjunction with _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations , in spite of recent progress @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the attainable quench - rates are typically several orders of magnitude faster than in experiment .",
    "inspired by the inverse design scheme of franceschetti and zunger @xcite , we have therefore recently devised a novel method for the generation of amorphous models in agreement with available experimental data @xcite .",
    "this method , which we called inverse simulated annealing ( isa ) , unifies the rmc and sa techniques to minimize the potential energy , as calculated by density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite , while concurrently maximizing the overlap with experiment . employing an electronic structure method , such as dft ,",
    "not only ensures that the atomic configurations are at least metastable by relaxing them into a local - energy minimum , but also facilitates to directly include constraints involving electronic structure properties , such as the band - gap or the dielectric constant , to name a few .    in this paper",
    ", we elaborate on the original isa method @xcite , including improvements in the minimization algorithm , as well as allowing for volume fluctuations at constant pressure @xcite .",
    "the resulting modified isa approach permits to generate amorphous models at a desired target pressure , which is particularly important when the experimental density of the amorphous is either not known , or expected to differ from the theoretical equilibrium density .",
    "in fact , it had been shown that amorphous models at the theoretical equilibrium density are generally better reproducing the structure of the real system than models generated at the experimental density @xcite .",
    "the predictive power of the present improved isa method is demonstrated by revisiting the structure of amorphous insb ( a - insb ) , a material of interest for application in infrared photodetectors @xcite and , at the eutectic composition , as a phase change compound in rewritable digital versatile disks ( dvd ) @xcite .",
    "using the improved isa method in conjunction with the experimental total pair correlation function ( pcf ) , allows to determine the amorphous structure of a - insb from _ first principles _ and to elucidate the local coordination .",
    "the remaining of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we present some improvements of the minimization procedure developed for the isa method and the extension of the method itself to include volume fluctuations .",
    "section iii is devoted to its application to a - insb , followed by a conclusion that is in section iv .",
    "in the original canonical isa approach @xcite , the atomic structure is determined by minimizing a function of the form @xmath0 by varying the atomic positions @xmath1 . in eq .",
    "[ utilde ] , @xmath2 is the potential energy , while @xmath3 is the calculated value of a property @xmath4 and @xmath5 the experimental reference data .",
    "the latter may include structural properties from scattering data , but also properties related to the electronic structure , such as the band gap .",
    "alternatively , we note that in analogy to the inverse design technique @xcite , @xmath5 could be replaced by a predetermined desired target property for a certain application .    in minimizing @xmath6",
    ", we take advantage of the fact that by employing eq .",
    "[ utilde ] , the accessible phase space is substantially reduced and confined to energetically low - lying atomic configurations . in other words , although the dimensionality of the phase space is unchanged , the optimization is guided in a funnel - like fashion towards the minimum of @xmath6 . nevertheless , devising an efficient minimizer is still one of the main challenges of our approach to facilitate the minimization of @xmath7 from first - principles .",
    "the hybrid mc - based sa method introduced in our previous work @xcite , has the following key properties : i ) it is a `` fuzzy '' hybrid mc method with all atom trial moves involving all nuclear forces , which ii ) is performed in the microcanonical nve ensemble with a correspondingly modified acceptance probability .",
    "the all atom trial moves are generated by a single energy conserving md step using a slightly modified velocity - verlet algorithm , where the time step @xmath8 is chosen at random , while @xmath9 is adjusted on - the - fly to achieve an acceptance probability of @xmath1050% . with this",
    ", @xmath9 is typically up to an order of magnitude larger than the maximum permissible time step in a conventional md simulation .",
    "it is important to note that the velocities are updated even if the configuration itself is rejected . in this way , the velocities @xmath11",
    "are gradually turned into the direction of the forces upon repeated rejections , which results in an increased acceptance probability for large displacements ( i.e. large @xmath12 ) and thus significant improvement in efficiency @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to the global nature of the stochastic optimization method , trapping in energetically high local minima is avoided . for the purpose to facilitate mc simulations within the nve ensemble ,",
    "the acceptance probability of the trial move is given by @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the applied total energy and @xmath15 is the number of atoms . note that in a nve simulation , the total energy @xmath14 is fixed , while the average temperature is assigned by @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the kinetic energy .",
    "for a sa simulation within the nve ensemble , @xmath14 is gradually reduced from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "for example , in the case of generating an amorphous model by quenching it from the melt , @xmath18 should be taken such that the system is in the liquid phase , whereas @xmath19 should be chosen as close as possible , though slightly above the ground state energy @xmath20 of the eventual amorphous phase . in the following we present some modifications of our original hybrid mc - based optimization method .",
    "flowchart of the minimization algorithm used in conjunction with the isa method .",
    "therein , @xmath21 are the velocities of atom @xmath22 , while @xmath23 corresponds to the total nuclear force @xmath24.,title=\"fig:\",width=355 ] [ flowchart ]    in this improved version , outlined in the flowchart of fig .",
    "[ flowchart ] , the acceptance probability is generalized to : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a number larger than zero and adjusted on - the - fly to achieve the desired acceptance rate of @xmath1050% , while @xmath9 is now kept constant . in other words , for @xmath27 all moves are accepted , while for a very large @xmath28 only downhill moves for which @xmath29 holds are accepted .",
    "the value at which @xmath28 equilibrates depends on @xmath9 . as it turns out , to maximize the efficiency ,",
    "@xmath9 should be chosen such that @xmath28 equilibrates to a value around 1/2 .",
    "this corresponds to a @xmath9 , which is about 10 times larger than the typical time step of a md simulation for the particular system .",
    "another improvement regards the annealing schedule .",
    "in fact , minimizing eq .",
    "[ utilde ] by reducing @xmath14 as a function of mc steps from @xmath18 to @xmath30 is rather inconvenient , since @xmath20 is _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "therefore , we have chosen to linearly decrease @xmath31 from @xmath32 to @xmath33 as a function of mc steps instead of @xmath14 , while maintaining to conduct the minimization in the nve ensemble as in our original approach .",
    "to that extend , @xmath14 is updated as soon as the instantaneously measured temperature @xmath34 is outside a given window @xmath35 around the applied temperature @xmath31 . the actual temperature @xmath34 is associated to the kinetic energy @xmath17 of the system by @xmath36 .",
    "therefore , after each accepted move , whenever @xmath37 , @xmath14 is adjusted such that the kinetic energy , and correspondingly the velocities , are in agreement with the applied temperature , i.e. such that @xmath38 .    to illustrate the increased efficiency of the modified optimization scheme , we have applied the canonical isa method to determine low energy structures of amorphous carbon using the reactive lcbopii carbon potential @xcite .",
    "comparison of the average over the final potential energies per atom @xmath39 at 0  k as a function of the total quenching ` time ' .",
    "the amorphous carbon models were generated using the empirical lcbopii carbon potential @xcite by a conventional md - based sa simulation , the original isa-1 technique as published in ref .",
    ", as well as the improved isa-2 method , which is outlined in the flowchart of fig .  [ flowchart ] .",
    "the averages are based on 40 independent simulations.,width=302 ]    a comparison of the average final energies per particle @xmath39 as a function of the total quenching time ( i.e. number of potential energy evaluations ) of the amorphous phases as obtained by the original and modified versions of the isa technique and those from an usual md - based sa simulation , is given in fig .",
    "[ u0_nmc ] . as can be seen , the improved isa method constitutes a sizable improvement with respect to the original scheme and is substantially more efficient than the conventional md - based sa approach .",
    "determining the atomic configuration of a system using the canonical isa method at constant particle density , will usually lead to structures , whose stress tensor is non - vanishing .",
    "in fact , the experimental density is often not known from the outset and it would be in general desirable to generate relaxed amorphous models at the theoretical equilibrium density .",
    "the latter might differ from the experimental equilibrium density due to the finite accuracy of the employed level of theory to calculate the interatomic forces .",
    "nevertheless , amorphous models at zero pressure can be directly generated by including volume fluctuations in the isa scheme , similar to standard mc simulations at constant pressure @xcite .    in order to keep the pressure fluctuating around a given target pressure @xmath40",
    ", we simply add the volume dependent contributions of the gibbs free energy to eq .",
    "[ utilde ] . the extended objective function @xmath41 now reads as : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the volume of the system , while @xmath44 is the standard mc acceptance probability in the npt ensemble .",
    "the change in @xmath41 due to a combined all atom and volume move is denoted as @xmath45 , while @xmath46 .",
    "however , minimizing @xmath47 with respect to @xmath43 requires to solve : @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the virial contribution and @xmath50 the ideal vapor ( kinetic ) contribution to the total pressure @xmath51 .",
    "hence , without the constraint terms , the condition @xmath52 implies that @xmath53 .",
    "so in that case we would find the instantaneous pressure @xmath54 of the system in the npt ensemble fluctuating around @xmath40 .",
    "but , how to achieve the same at the presence of multiple constraint terms is not obvious since during the simulation @xmath55 is in general non - zero , as well as @xmath56 . for the purpose to circumvent or at least reduce the spurious pressure contributions that are originating form the various constraint terms ,",
    "the weight factor @xmath57 should be chosen as small as possible , although at the same time large enough to achieve the desired agreement with the desired target property .",
    "fortunately , for certain properties the just mentioned issue can be solved in a more elegant way by defining the constraint terms in a form that is invariant under volume fluctuations . in particular , this is possible for the pcf @xcite , for which experimental data is very often available .",
    "to that extend , the constraint term , which we denote as @xmath58 , can be defined in a scale invariant form as : @xmath59 where the sum is over the @xmath60 grid points @xmath61 on which the experimental pcf @xmath62 is discretized . the scale factor @xmath63 , while @xmath64 is the actual and @xmath65 the corresponding experimental density of the system .",
    "the eventual scaled pcf is denoted as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 are discretized and rescaled grid points . in the case of the reduced pcf ( rpcf ) , which is defined as @xmath68 , the scale invariant form of the constraint term reads as : @xmath69 in order to calculate the force contributions from eqs .",
    "[ ut_pcf ] and [ ut_rpcf ] , respectively , we have employed a smoothing filter .",
    "more details on the gaussian smoothening and on the choice of the weight factors @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively , as well as how to eventually calculate the corresponding force contributions are given in the appendix .",
    "due to the fact that the scale factor @xmath72 is strictly related to the density ratio @xmath73 , for a given @xmath74 , the scale factor @xmath72 only changes due to volume fluctuations . as a consequence , the experimental target density @xmath74 must be known .",
    "however , in order to deal with cases where @xmath74 is _ a priori _ unknown , we have also implemented a scheme where @xmath72 is varied in addition to the aforementioned volume fluctuations . in principle , this is identical to vary the unknown @xmath74 in order to predict the value that maximizes the agreement between the instantaneously computed and desired target pcf .",
    "in our previous work @xcite , the model of a - insb was generated by quenching from the melt using the dft - based second generation car - parrinello md method of khne et al .",
    "it was found that short md quenches ( up to 130  ps ) gave rise to an octahedral arrangement , while the resulting structure of a longer md quench ( @xmath10330  ps ) was mostly tetrahedral .",
    "however , for the latter a much more confined basis set had been used to accommodate for the increased computational cost .",
    "furthermore , in a subsequent study on the closely related in@xmath75sbte@xmath76 compound , it was demonstrated that the structure critically depends on the density as well @xcite . while at high density , the bonding of the in atoms is mostly octahedral - like , at low density a sizable fraction of tetrahedral - like geometries had been observed .",
    "this variability originates from a close competition between tetrahedral - like and octahedral - like sites , as previously found in related amorphous tellurides @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , this immediately suggests that in the presence of nanovoids in the amorphous / liquid phase , the inclusion of van der waals interactions might be particularly important and may result is a somewhat higher density @xcite .",
    "in fact , neglecting van der waals interactions , at the dft level using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) exchange and correlation ( xc ) functional @xcite , the theoretical equilibrium density was shown to be 3 % lower than the experimental value @xcite . utilizing the increased efficiency of the modified isa method , we are revisiting here the amorphous phase of insb including van der waals interactions in order to investigate the sensitivity of the structure on the density and in particular if it is more tetrahedral or octahedral .      to model the amorphous phase of insb a cubic supercell consisting of 216 atoms subject to periodic boundary conditions was considered . in the following two isa simulations",
    "are presented , a canonical calculation at the experimental density and an isobaric one at zero pressure . in both cases",
    "the rpcf had been employed as the experimental target function to guide to optimization , while @xmath71 of eq .",
    "[ ut_rpcf ] has been taken equal to 1.0 ev @xmath77 .",
    "the experimental @xmath78 as well as the corresponding density @xmath74 were both obtained from the data in ref .   on a - insb",
    "grown by sputtering . for the constant volume simulations",
    "the parameter @xmath72 was fixed and equal to 1 , while at at constant pressure it follows the density fluctuations through @xmath79 .",
    "starting from a well equilibrated melt , the system was quenched to 1000  k and re - equilibrated for around 1000 hybrid mc - steps @xcite .",
    "thereafter , the temperature was linearly decreased from 1000  k to 300  k within 8000 hybrid mc - steps before cooling the system to the ground state in additional 1000 hybrid mc - steps .",
    "for the purpose to compute the potential energies and nuclear forces at the semi - local dft level , we have linked our isa code with the quickstep module of the cp2k suite of programs @xcite . in this method ,",
    "the kohn - sham orbitals are expanded in contracted gaussians , whereas the electronic charge density is represented using plane waves . for the former ,",
    "an accurate double-@xmath80 valence polarized basis set ( dzvp ) was employed @xcite , while the latter was expanded on a regular plane wave grid using a density cutoff of 100  ry to efficiently solve the periodic hartree potential .",
    "moreover , the pbe xc functional @xcite and norm - conserving goedecker - type pseudopotentials with three and five valence electrons for the in and sb atoms were used @xcite . due to the presence of disorder ,",
    "the brillouin zone integration was restricted to the supercell @xmath81-point only . in the constant pressure simulations we also included a damped interatomic potential to approximately account for van der waals interactions @xcite .    for the sake of comparison we have additionally performed two rather long dft - based md quenches ( 225  ps and 350  ps , which are denoted as md-1 and md-2 , respectively ) with exactly the same settings as before using the second - generation car - parrinello approach together with a discretized integration time step of 2.0  fs .      a comparison of the final energies of the present canonical isa simulation and dft - based md quenches , as well as the previously published model of ref",
    "are given in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".[table1]potential energies of the geometry optimized models of a - insb relative to the one of the canonical isa method , as generated by two long dft - based md quenches ( md-1 and md-2 ) and the previously published model of ref .",
    "the corresponding pressures of the optimized models at the experimental density are given in the last column . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the present isa results indicate that the structure of a - insb that is compatible with the experimental pcf is mostly tetrahedral for both in and sb atoms , which is in agreement with our previous work based on a long dft - based md quench using a rather confined basis set @xcite . instead , quenching from the melt at the dft - pbe level of theory employing a more accurate basis set than previously , but neglecting van der waals interactions , the local structure of the 4-fold coordinated sb atoms is more octahedral - like , although in less good agreement with experiment .",
    "we conclude by noting that the latter outcome points to a a potential deficiency of the employed pbe xc functional when dealing with the close competition in energy between tetrahedral - like and octahedral - like configurations , which is probably also responsible for the tetrahedral - to - octahedral transition observed experimentally in a - insb under moderate pressure @xcite .",
    "other xc functionals , however , such as the becke - lee - yang - parr ( blyp ) @xcite or so - called hybrid functionals , which include some fraction of exact hartree - fock exchange , are known to entail a stronger electron localization than the employed pbe xc functional @xcite .",
    "a stronger electron localization is expected to favor tetrahedra against defective octahedra , as was indeed observed in simulations of liquid gese @xcite",
    ". it would therefore be interesting to assess the influence of the xc functional , including hybrids , on the structure of amorphous solids .",
    "this is now made possible by the superior efficiency of the isa method , which allows to routinely determine the atomic structure of rather complex disordered systems at a higher level of theory , than previously thought feasible .",
    "we would like to thank the idee project of the carl - zeiss foundation and the graduate school of excellence mainz for financial support .",
    "in the present isa simulations the constraint on the rpcf , denoted by @xmath82 of eq .  [ ut_rpcf ] , is calculated as : @xmath83 where @xmath84 and the sum over @xmath85 runs over all pairs of atoms , while @xmath86 is a gaussian - like polynomial of width @xmath87 given by : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is defined on the open interval @xmath90 , whereas @xmath91 outside this interval . here",
    ", @xmath92 is the interatomic distance between the atoms @xmath22 and @xmath93 . by construction , @xmath94 and @xmath95 at @xmath96 , so that @xmath97 is continuous up to the first derivative .",
    "changing the variable to @xmath98 for a given pair pair of atoms @xmath99 , we rewrite : @xmath100 where @xmath101 $ ] , @xmath102 $ ] and the analytic function @xmath103 a polynomial in @xmath92 .",
    "the force contributions @xmath104 with @xmath105 can now be computed as : @xmath106 where @xmath107 applying a uniform scaling factor @xmath72 to scale the variables @xmath61 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , results in @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively . according to eq .",
    "[ grn ] , the scaled rpcf @xmath113 at @xmath114 is equal to @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the rpcf before the scaling .",
    "hence , @xmath117 is independent of the scaling factor @xmath72 .",
    "the optimal weight factor @xmath70 or @xmath71 depends on the number of grid points @xmath118 in eq .",
    "[ ut_pcf ] or [ ut_rpcf ] , respectively , as well as on the choice of the smoothening parameter @xmath109 of eq .",
    "varying the grid density , the ideal @xmath71 should scale as @xmath119 .",
    "a too small value for @xmath109 corresponds to an insufficient gaussian smoothening and will give rise to spurious force contributions @xmath120 .",
