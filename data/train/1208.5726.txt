    "the study of solar oscillations has proven to be a powerful tool to infer the properties of the solar interior .",
    "global helioseismology , based on the interpretation of the eigenfrequencies of the resonant modes of oscillations , has provided a robust description of the internal structure and dynamics of the sun . in the last years",
    ", these studies have been complemented by focusing on local features .",
    "local helioseismology interprets the full wave field observed at the surface .",
    "several complemetary techniques have been developed to probe local perturbations , as fourier - hankel spectral analysis @xcite , ring - diagram analysis @xcite , time - distance helioseismology @xcite , and acoustic holography @xcite .",
    "for an accurate interpretation of the measurements obtained from all these procedures , it is extremely important to achieve a deep understanding of the physics involved in the wave propagation . due to the increasing interest of helioseismologists in active regions , such as sunspots ,",
    "the knowledge of the inteaction of waves with magnetic structures has been greatly developed in the recent years .",
    "the conversion from fast - mode high-@xmath0 acoustic waves to slow - mode low-@xmath0 waves in solar active region is well - understood from the theoretical point of view @xcite .",
    "an example of the success of this analytical development is the comparison of the observational absorption and phase shift data @xcite with the modeled results obtained from the conversion @xcite .",
    "numerically , the fast - to - slow conversion is also well studied in sunspot - like atmospheres @xcite , as well as flux tubes @xcite .",
    "see @xcite for a review .",
    "not all the developments of phenomena associated with wave propagation in magnetic structures have reached the same degree of maturity .",
    "an insufficiently modelled effect is the fast - to - alfvn conversion .",
    "pure alfvn waves can only exist in those mediums which are homogeneous in the direction perpendicular to both magnetic field and wavenumber .",
    "in general , this will not be the situation in a gravitationally stratifed atmosphere with complex magnetic field structure , although we will simply refer to alfvn waves even in this case .",
    "the fast - to - alfvn conversion only occurs when the wave propagation is not contained in the same plane of the density stratification and magnetic field and , thus , three dimensional ( 3d ) analysis are necessary .",
    "the study of this process was started by @xcite , who studied the 3d propagation of oscillations in a polytrope permeated by an uniform magnetic field of arbitrary inclination , and found downward alfvn waves .",
    "@xcite obtained that the conversion to the alfvn mode is most efficient for field inclinations from vertical between 30 and 40 degrees , and azimuth angles ( the angle between the magnetic field and wave propagation planes ) between 60 and 80 degrees .",
    "@xcite found that the interaction between fast and alfvn waves is spread across many scale height , unlike the fast - to - slow , which is limited around the layer where the sound speed @xmath1 and the alfvn speed @xmath2 are similar .",
    "as the frequency increases the mode conversion is progressively more localized , although at the frequencis relevant to local helioseismology ( around 3 - 5 mhz ) the fast - to - alfvn conversion region spans the whole chromosphere .",
    "recently , khomenko and cally have studied the conversion to the alfvn mode by means of 2.5d numerical simulations in homogeneous field configurations @xcite , as well as realistic sunspot - like structures @xcite . in these works they obtained the dependence of the efficiency of the conversion with the inclination and azimuth . however , in the sunspot configuration the conversion was only evaluated at some limited angles corresponding to selected 2d planes of the model .",
    "the aim of this work is to extend the results from @xcite to 3d",
    ". it will allow us to populate the voids in their diagrams of fast - to - alfvn conversion efficiency .",
    "more relevant , the development of full 3d simulations provides the results for the complete wave field , where waves can propagate freely in all spatial directions without being restricted to a two - dimensional plane .",
    "the conversion to the alfvn mode in realistic 3d atmospheres has not been studied before with the detailed evaluation of the efficiency discussed in this paper .",
    "the three - dimensional ( 3d ) non - linear magnetohydrodynamic equations are solved using the numerical code mancha @xcite .",
    "the code solves the equations for perturbations , obtained after removing the equilibrium state from the equations . a perfect matched layer ( pml ) is used to avoid wave reflection at the top boundary @xcite , while periodic boundary conditions are imposed in the horizontal boundaries .",
    "the initial perturbation is set in the bottom boundary with small amplitude in order to ensure that the simulations are in the linear regime .    as a background atmosphere we use a magnetostatic ( mhs ) sunspot model , adopted from @xcite .",
    "this model is a thick flux tube with distributed currents , azimuthally symmetric and has no twist .",
    "we set the height reference @xmath3 mm at the photospheric level , where the optical depth at 500 nm is unity in the quiet sun atmosphere . at this height the magnetic field at the axis is 900 g. the spatial resolution is 150 km in the horizontal directions and 50 km in the vertical direction .",
    "the computational domain spans from @xmath4 mm , where the minus sign indicates that it is below the photosphere , to @xmath5 mm .",
    "the upper 500 km ( 10 grid points ) correspond to the pml boundary layer , so the effective top of the simulation is located at @xmath6 mm .",
    "the horizontal extent of the domain is @xmath7 $ ] mm and @xmath8 $ ] mm , with the axis of the sunspot located at @xmath9 , @xmath10 mm . at 39 mm from the sunspot axis",
    "the thermodynamic variables of the model are taken from model s @xcite in the deep sub - photosphere layers and val - c model @xcite in the photosphere and chromosphere , stabilized following the method by @xcite to avoid the convective instability .",
    "the axis of the sunspot is given by the @xcite model .",
    "the atmosphere between the quiet sun boundary and the umbral model at the axis merges smoothly .",
    "waves are driven in a few grid points at the bottom boundary at @xmath4 mm .",
    "the perturbations in pressure , density , and velocity are calculated analytically as an acoustic - gravity wave of a given frequency and wavenumber , neglecting the magnetic field and temperature gradient @xcite .",
    "the detailed form of the perturbations can be found in @xcite . in this simulation",
    "the frequency was set to @xmath11 mhz , slightly below the maximum cut off frequency reached at the temperature minimum , and the horizontal wave number to @xmath12 mm@xmath13 .    in order to indentify the slow , fast , and alfvn wave modes in the magnetically dominated region of the computational domain ,",
    "the velocity and magnetic field perturbations have been projected according to their orientation with respect to the equilibrium magnetic field onto these three characteristic directions :    @xmath14    @xmath15    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the magnetic field inclination from the vertical and @xmath18 is the field azimuth , measured from the @xmath19 plane .",
    "the projection @xmath20 is along the magnetic field and it selects the slow magneto - acoustic wave in the low-@xmath0 region ; the projection @xmath21 was chosen after @xcite and it gives the asymptotic polarization direction of the alfvn mode ; and the last projection @xmath22 is set normal to the other two , corresponding to the fast wave in the low-@xmath0 regime .",
    "these projections have already been successfully used to separate the three wave modes in idealized magnetic field configurations @xcite as well as more complex magnetic topologies @xcite .",
    "these projections assume that the wavevector @xmath23 is contained in the @xmath24 plane . in these simulations",
    "@xmath23 will not be limited to that plane , since the raypath can bend due to background variations in the @xmath25 direction .",
    "this would have some effect in the accuracy of the projections , but it can probably be neglected .    as a measure of the efficiency of the conversion to each mode , the time - averaged wave energy fluxes @xcite were calculated in the magnetically dominated region .",
    "the acoustic energy flux is obtained from the expression :    @xmath26    while the magnetic energy flux is given by :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are the eulerian perturbations in pressure , velocity , and magnetic field , respectively , @xmath31 is the background magnetic field , and @xmath32 is the magnetic permeability . in the region where @xmath33",
    "the acoustic energy flux contains the energy of the slow mode , while the magnetic flux includes the fast and alfvn modes .",
    "the time - averaged energy of the three wave modes was also calculated from the relations :    @xmath34    @xmath35    @xmath36    where @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 are the velocity projections into the characteristic directions from equations [ eq : elong]-[eq : etrans ] , and @xmath40 is the density in the equilibrium state .",
    "these expressions provide an approximation of the wave energy assuming equipartition between kinetic and other energies . in the case of pure acoustic or alfvn waves ,",
    "there is strict equipartition between kinetic and compressional or magnetic energy , respectively , and equations ( [ eq : elong]-[eq : etrans ] ) correspond to the real energies .",
    "when the fast acoustic wave which was driven at the bottom boundary reaches the @xmath41 layer several mode transformations take place . above that layer , in the magnetically dominated atmosphere ,",
    "the incident wave splits into a slow acoustic mode , a fast magnetic mode , and an alfvn mode .",
    "figure [ fig : velocities ] shows snapshots of the projected velocities scaled with a factor @xmath42 , where @xmath43 for the @xmath37 component and @xmath44 for the other two components , after 19 min of simulation .",
    "the stationary regime is achieved after about 10 minutes of simulations .",
    "the inclination of the magnetic field @xmath17 varies from @xmath45 at the center of the sunspot to being almost horizontal at the boundaries of the computatial domain .",
    "the azimuth @xmath46 corresponds to all the positions at @xmath10 mm with positive @xmath47 value , and it increases up to @xmath48 at @xmath10 mm and negative @xmath47 values , including all the angles between these two extremes .",
    "each of the waves modes presents a different distribution across the 3d atmosphere of the sunspot . in the magnetically dominated atmosphere",
    "the slow wave appears in the @xmath37 projection .",
    "the @xmath49 cut ( top left panel ) shows that the conversion to the slow mode is significative at almost all the positions of the sunspot . however , there are some locations where this transformation is specially favoured .",
    "the strongest slow wave signal appears for @xmath47 between @xmath50 and @xmath51 mm and @xmath52 between @xmath53 and @xmath54 mm .",
    "this region corresponds to moderate inclinations around @xmath55 .",
    "although the frequency of the wave is below the cut - off frequency , the slow mode can reach the upper atmosphere because of the reduced cut - off value due to the inclination of the magnetic field .",
    "however , the vertical magnetic field at the axis of the sunspot avoids the propagation of slow waves around the center of the sunspot , and they produce evanescent modes . in general , the amplitude of the slow mode in the x - positive region of the sunspot is higher than the x - negative region .",
    "the driving perturbation generates an acoustic - gravity wave which propagates from left to right .",
    "thus , the right half of the sunspot has a better alignment between the direction of propagation and the field lines , producing a more efficient conversion from fast acoustic waves ( in the region where @xmath56 ) to slow acoustic waves ( in the region where @xmath33 ) .",
    "the vertical cut of the slow mode ( figure [ fig : velocities]d ) shows an interference pattern above the solid line , near the top boundary .",
    "it appears mainly in the left part of the sunspot , between @xmath57 mm and @xmath58 mm .",
    "the interference is produced between the upward propagating slow mode and a downward propagating wave produced by the partial reflection of the slow mode due to the steep temperature increase at the chromosphere .",
    "similar result was found in the 2.5d simulations from @xcite , where they confirmed that this reflection is a physical effect rather than an artifact from the top boundary . this reflection is stronger near the center of the sunspot , where the gradient of the temperature is steeper ( figure [ fig : temperature ] ) , as can be seen in panel @xmath59 from figure [ fig : velocities ] . when the reflected wave reaches the @xmath60 layer it undergoes a secondary transformation , generating a new fast acoustic mode and a slow magnetic mode visible below the solid line in figures [ fig : velocities]d and [ fig : velocities]e , respectively .    the fast magnetic mode in the low-@xmath0 region",
    "is reflected back down due to the gradients of the alfvn speed ( figure [ fig : velocities]e ) .",
    "if we neglect the contribution of the sound speed to the fast wave speed , the reflection height is given by the layer where the wave frequency @xmath61 and the horizontal wave number @xmath62 are related by @xmath63 , and it is represented in the figure by a dashed line . around the center of the sunspot the reflection is completed and at the height where panel @xmath64 is obtained there is no fast mode in that region .",
    "farther from the axis of the sunspot the transformation layer is located at a higher height , and the insufficient height of the top boundary of the computational domain avoids the complete reflection of the fast mode .    the alfvn wave can be seen in panels @xmath65 and @xmath66 . along @xmath10 mm , which corresponds to @xmath46 , there is no wave power in the alfvn mode . at this position",
    "the magnetic field is contained in the @xmath24 plane , since @xmath67 g , making this plane equivalent to a 2d case . under these conditions",
    "the alfvn mode is decoupled from the fast and slow magneto - acoustic modes , and it is not possible for the incident wave to undergo conversion to the alfvn mode . as regions farther from the @xmath10 mm plane are considered the conversion to the alfvn mode becomes more efficient .",
    "it shows a highest amplitude at around @xmath68 .",
    "before evaluating the contribution of the different wave modes to the energy in the upper part of the atmosphere , we have checked the validity of the projections described in the previous section , in order to ensure that they provide an accurate decoupling of the slow , fast , and alfvn waves .",
    "following @xcite , we have calculated the ratio @xmath69 . since the kinetic and magnetic energy for an alfvn wave is in equipartition , one would expect the ratio @xmath70 to be equal to one for that waves .",
    "figure [ fig : polarization ] shows the ratio @xmath70 for the three projected components of the velocity and magnetic field . in each case ,",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath71 pairs were obtained from the decomposition in the directions defined by equations [ eq : elong ] and [ eq : etrans ] .",
    "the ratio is evaluated at heights from 400 km above the transformation layer to the top boundary , and it is averaged in time for the stationary stage of the simulations . it reveals the different nature of the three projections . for the @xmath20 direction at @xmath72 , the ratio @xmath70 present small values around @xmath73 , indicating that this component is dominated by the velocity variations rather than magnetic , and confirming that this projection contains the slow acoustic waves .",
    "however , at higher inclinations the magnetic variations associated with velocity variations are bigger .",
    "an opposite behavior is found for the @xmath22 component . in this case , in the regions where @xmath72 the ratio @xmath70 is big , around @xmath74 , and it becomes smaller at higher inclinations .",
    "these plots indicate that the projections @xmath20 and @xmath22 provide a good estimation of the slow and fast waves , respectively , in the upper atmosphere when the inclination of the magnetic field is below @xmath75 . at higher inclinations",
    "both wave modes are mixed up , since the projection directions are asymptotic , valid strictly only where the alfvn speed is much higher than the sound speed . at these locations",
    "this criterion is not fulfilled .",
    "the right panel of figure [ fig : polarization ] illustrates the ratio @xmath70 for the @xmath21 component .",
    "it shows a ratio around @xmath76 for all the atmosphere , indicating that for this projections the velocity and magnetic perturbations are in equipartition , which confirm the alfvnic nature of the oscillations in this characteristic direction .",
    "figure [ fig : phase ] shows the phase difference between the perturbations in the velocity and magnetic field in the direction @xmath21 , which correspond to the alfvn wave . for a pure alfvn mode",
    "a phase shift of 180@xmath77 indicates upward propagation , while negative phase shifts correspond to downward propagation .",
    "most of the right part of the sunspot , that is , for azimuths between @xmath45 and @xmath78 , presents a phase shift around @xmath79 . at these locations",
    "the alfvn waves come from the conversion of the upward propagating fast acoustic mode introduced in the high-@xmath0 region , and they keep their upward propagation to higher layers . however , at some positions in the left side of the sunspot ( with @xmath18 between @xmath78 and @xmath79 ) the negative sign of the phase shift indicates downward propagating waves .",
    "the direction of the propagation of the alfvn waves in this simulation shows a perfect agreement with the one obtained by @xcite . since the efficiency of the conversion to the alfvn mode is enhanced with the alignment of the direction of propagation and magnetic field , in the right part of the sunspot the upward propagating fast waves couple to upward alfvn waves . on the other hand , in the left part of the sunspot",
    "the most efficient conversion to alfvn waves occurs for the refracted downward propagating fast waves @xcite .",
    "see figure 1 from @xcite for a schematic representation of these mode transformations .",
    "the acoustic and magnetic energy fluxes were calculated using equations [ eq : fac ] and [ eq : fmag ] , respectively .",
    "figures [ fig : fluxxz ] and [ fig : fluxxy ] show the time - average results , including all the time steps after the stationary regime is achieved .",
    "the former one corresponds to a @xmath24 cut at @xmath80 mm .",
    "the magnetic flux is only plotted above the @xmath60 layer , where the distinction of the three different modes using the projections described in equations [ eq : elong]-[eq : etrans ] is meaningful .",
    "the later figure shows a @xmath49 plot at @xmath81 mm .        most of the domain presents a positive acoustic flux , which corresponds to the upward propagating slow mode in the low-@xmath0 region .",
    "the highest contribution of this mode is located at the right side of the sunspot , especially at moderate inclinations where the amplitude of the @xmath37 projections was higher in figure [ fig : velocities ] .",
    "however , at the left part of the sunspot a negative flux is obtained .",
    "this downward propagating slow mode flux is particularly large near the axis of the sunspot and represents the slow waves reflected by the temperature gradient , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "the 5 mhz frequency fast acoustic wave which propagates upward in the high-@xmath0 region reaches the conversion layer @xmath60 before the high value of the cut - off frequency avoids its propagation .",
    "note that near the center of the sunspot the cut - off frequency presents its highest value of @xmath82 mhz at the temperature minimum , which is located 375 km above the @xmath60 layer . just above this layer , the recently converted slow acoustic mode becomes an evanescent wave .",
    "this situation differs from what happen at locations far from the axis of the sunspot , where the field inclination reduces the effective cut - off and allows the slow mode waves to scape to the upper atmosphere . at a height located a few hundreds kilometers higher than the temperature minimum",
    ", the cut - off frequency of the atmosphere is again below 5 mhz due to the chromospheric increase of the temperature , and the slow mode near the axis can propagate again , allowing the downward propagation of the waves reflected by the rise of the temperature .    above the transformation layer the magnetic energy flux includes the fast and alfvn modes .",
    "the middle panel of figure [ fig : fluxxz ] shows that the magnetic flux is positive at most heights , while in the middle panel of figure [ fig : fluxxy ] can be seen how it increases in the @xmath52 direction toward the periphery of the sunspot . on the other hand ,",
    "near the @xmath47 boundaries of the model a negative magnetic flux appears , larger than the highest positive magnetic flux .",
    "this negative flux must be produced by the reflected fast wave .    for a more detailed analysis of the contribution of the different wave modes ,",
    "the magnetic flux of the alfvn wave was deattached from the total magnetic flux by recalculating the magnetic flux but using the projections of the velocity and magnetic field in the @xmath22 direction in equation [ eq : fmag ] .",
    "the result is plotted in the bottom and right panels of figures [ fig : fluxxz ] and [ fig : fluxxy ] , respectively .",
    "the vertical cut reveals that at @xmath80 mm the vertical alfvn flux is positive in the righ part and negative in the left part , that is , at the right part of the domain the alfvn wave propagate upward and at the left part they propagate downward .",
    "this result agrees with the one obtained in the previous section from the phase shift between @xmath38 and @xmath83 .",
    "the @xmath49 cut shows that the alfvn energy flux increases at locations with higher inclinations , far from the axis of the sunspot , only for those regions of the atmosphere whose azimuth @xmath18 is different from @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the highest alfvn energy flux is obtained near the @xmath52 boundaries .",
    "note that it is comparable to the highest acoustic energy flux .",
    "the negative flux at the left side of the sunspot shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : fluxxz ] is hardly visible in the right panel of figure [ fig : fluxxy ] because of the different scale used in the plots .",
    "a comparison between middle and right panels of figure [ fig : fluxxy ] reveals that the negative magnetic flux from the @xmath47 boundaries is missing in the alfvn energy flux , so it corresponds to the reflected fast mode , as previously stated .",
    "at the positions where the alfvn energy flux is larger the total magnetic flux shows a lower positive value , meaning that at these locations the fast wave must also contribute with a negative flux .",
    "the wave energy of the slow , fast , and alfvn modes was calculated from equations [ eq : elong]-[eq : etrans ] , using the corresponding projected velocities . to be consistent with the work by @xcite and",
    "provide a direct comparison with their 2.5d simulations , time averaged energies were obtained at heights from 400 km above the @xmath60 layer up to the upper boundary of the simulation box in the stationary stage of the simulations .",
    "figure [ fig : energy_xy ] illustrates the results for all the horizontal positions from the computational domain .",
    "the left panel shows that there is a prominent maximum of the slow wave energy at the right part of the sunspot , not far from the axis . the highest slow mode energy apears at around @xmath84 mm and @xmath10 mm .",
    "the main interest of this measurement is to quantify the amount of energy which is converted at the @xmath60 from the incident fast acoustic mode to the outgoing upward propagating slow acoustic mode .",
    "for this reason , in the left panel the regions with negative acoustic flux in figure [ fig : fluxxy ] have been masked , since the slow wave energy in that locations does not comes directly from the conversion layer but from the reflection due to the temperature gradient .",
    "the wave energies have been plotted as function of inclination and azimuth of the sunspot magnetic field lines at the corresponding horizontal locations in figure [ fig : energy_angulo ] .",
    "this format allows a direct comparison with @xcite figure 2 , @xcite figure 4 , and @xcite figure 5 . in the left panel",
    "the angles corresponding to the positions with negative acoustic flux has also been masked .",
    "it shows that the maximum slow wave energy is obtained when the direction of the wave incidence forms an angle @xmath46 with the magnetic field , for an inclination around @xmath85 .",
    "this result is consistent with the 2d analysis from @xcite , where they shown that around this field inclination the attack angle , , the angle between the wavevector and the magnetic field at the conversion layer , is small and produce an enhacement of the conversion from the fast acoustic to the slow acoustic wave .",
    "the region where the conversion to the slow mode is efficient extends to higher azimuths , although it decreases significantly for @xmath18 higher than @xmath86 .",
    "the distribution of the slow mode energy as a function of @xmath17 and @xmath18 shows an excellent agreement with figure 2 from @xcite .",
    "the only difference appears at higher azimuths , which correspond to the left part of the sunspots , where the reflection of the slow mode produced by the temperature increase complicates the evaluation of the upward propagating slow mode energy in this simulation of conversion in a realistic sunspot model .",
    "the alfvn wave energy increases toward the periphery of the sunspot , except along @xmath10 mm ( right panel of figure [ fig : energy_xy ] ) .",
    "its maximum value is obtained very close to the boundary of the computational domain around @xmath9 mm .",
    "its representation as a function of inclination and azimuth ( right panel of figure [ fig : energy_angulo ] ) reveals that the conversion to the alfvn mode is efficient at inclinations above @xmath87 and azimuths between @xmath75 and @xmath88 . at @xmath89 , which corresponds to the right side of the sunspot",
    ", the alfvn energy extends to higher inclinations than the left part of the sunspot .",
    "this is also visible in figure [ fig : energy_xy ] .",
    "the distribution of the alfvn energy with @xmath17 and @xmath18 is remarkably similar to the one found previously from the 3d analysis by @xcite in homogeneous fields .",
    "however , a few differences arise . in @xcite",
    "the highest conversion to alfvn waves appears at @xmath90 , while in our simulations the maximum energy is shifted toward higher inclinations .",
    "a similar shift in the position of the maximum was obtained from the 2.5d simulations of @xcite in homogeneous magnetic fields . since the alfvnic energy peaks so close to the boundary of our simulations , it is hard to say if the maximum conversion occurs at @xmath91 , as shown by the plot , or at even higher inclinations .",
    "moreover , the maximum energy appears in the left part of the sunspot , corresponding to @xmath92 .",
    "this differs from the analysis of homogeneous magnetic fields , where the maximum is located at @xmath93 @xcite or at @xmath94 @xcite . in the 2.5d simulations in a sunspot model from @xcite the energy of the alfvn wave peaks at azimuths between @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "middle panel of figure [ fig : energy_angulo ] shows some fast wave energy at high inclinations .",
    "in this paper we have studied the conversion from fast to alfvn modes in a realistic sunspot - like atmosphere by means of 3d numerical simulations .",
    "this study provides a direct comparison with analytical works @xcite as well as numerical simulations @xcite .    with regards to the fast - to - slow conversion , the efficiency of the transformation peaks at inclinations around 25@xmath77 and low azimuths , and it decreases at higher azimuths",
    "this result shows a good agreement with previous works @xcite in homogeneous magnetic field configurations .",
    "however , the sunspot - like structure of this simulation produce some differences in the wave modes of the upper atmosphere . in the central and left part of the sunspot the simulation shows downward propagating slow waves , which are reflected due to the chromospheric increase of the temperature .",
    "a similar result was found in the 2.5d simulations from @xcite , although in our case the downward flux near the axis is enhanced because of the higher increase of the temperature at the center of the sunspot . in @xcite simulations the closest plane to the axis of the sunspot",
    "is located at a distance of 7.5 mm , where the increase of the temperature in the transition region is lower ( figure [ fig : temperature ] ) .",
    "the simulation presented in this paper supposes a step forward in the study of the conversion to the alfvn mode , since it accounts for full 3d .",
    "the work by @xcite was limited to 2.5d , and only a few vertical slices across the sunspot model at several distances from the axis were analyzed . since the fast - to - alfvn conversion depends strongly on the angle between the direction of wave propagation and the magnetic field , a full 3d simulation is required to retrieve the complete description .",
    "the simulation shows that the highest alfvnic wave energy is obtained at high inclinations and for azimuths between @xmath75 and @xmath88 .",
    "the efficiency of the conversion obtained for the sunspot model shows a similar pattern to the homogeneous magnetic fields from @xcite , although the maximum of the magnetic energy of alfvn waves is shifted toward more inclined fields .",
    "a comparison of the total energy in the upper atmosphere of the upward propagating slow acoustic energy and the corresponding to the alfvn mode reveals that the former one is around two times higher .",
    "this result remarks the important role of the alfvn energy at the chromosphere . at @xmath97",
    "the acoustic energy is much higher than the alfvn energy , especially at low azimuths where its conversion is more efficient .",
    "however , at higher inclinations the alfvn energy becomes dominant and at @xmath98 and @xmath18 around @xmath78 it is more than 7 times higher than the acoustic energy .",
    "the horizontal size of the computational domain prevent us to measure the energy at higher inclinations for these azimuths , but from the tendency shown in the computed region one would expect a strongest dominance of the alfvn energy at higher inclinations .",
    "moreover , the vertical limitation of the domain also reduces the energy in the alfvn mode . at the 5 mhz frequency of this simulation",
    "the fast - to - alfvn conversion region spans over 20 scale heights @xcite .",
    "since our computational box has a much lower size , only a small fraction of the conversion is completed in our domain .",
    "the same limitation affects the simulations from @xcite .",
    "however , in our case we have found a higher energy in the alfvn wave due to the higher inclinations covered by our computational domain .    despite of the dependence of the conversion with the azimuth , due to the stochastic direction of the wave propagation in the sun , one would expect to find an efficient conversion to the alfvn wave at all the locations surrounding a sunspot with a certain inclination .",
    "near the umbra - penumbra boundary , the waves whose attack angle is below @xmath78 will generate upward propagating alfvn waves , while the incident waves which propagate in the opposite direction will produce downward alfvn waves . in this way , in these regions upgoing and downgoing waves",
    "will coexist . on the other hand , at the higher inclinations of the penumbra , the energy flux of the alfvn mode",
    "is only composed by upward propagating waves for all the directions of incidence of the fast acoustic wave where the conversion to the alfvn wave is efficient , as shown by the right panel from figure [ fig : fluxxy ] at @xmath99 .",
    "it differs from the situation at @xmath100 , where at some regions of the sunspot there is negative flux . in the case of solar observations , where the incident waves propagate in all directions , the alfvn waves in an annular region surrounding the sunspot with higher inclinations ( around @xmath99 )",
    "will only consist on upward propagating waves .",
    "the small time step imposed by the high chromospheric alfvn speed has been an important concern in the development of the numerical simulations presented in this paper .",
    "some considerations have been taken into account in the numerical configuration regarding this issue .",
    "firstly , a magnetic field strength of 900 g was adopted at the axis of the sunspot at the photosphere .",
    "this value is well below what might be expected in a mature sunspot .",
    "a more realistic field strength would lower the height of the @xmath60 and the fast mode reflection layers .",
    "this would allow the fast - to - alfvn conversion to be produced in a bigger region of the computational domain , and might generate an even higher alfvn energy flux at the top of the computational domain .",
    "secondly , this top boundary has been set at the chromosphere .",
    "the recent work by @xcite has shown the interesting effects of the chromosphere - corona transition region on fast - to - alfvn conversion .",
    "they found that the reflection of the alfvn waves at the transition region @xcite is sensitive to the distance between the fast reflection point and the transition region .",
    "the alfvn flux that can reach the corona is increased when this distance is small . in the present work",
    "the computational box does not include the transition region , since it would produce an even smaller time step , compromising the realization of this simulation using a reasonable amount of computational time .",
    "it would be interesting to extend the simulations to the corona and adopt a realistic magnetic field strength , but it is out of the scope of this paper and shall be accounted for in forthcoming works .",
    "i would like to thank elena khomenko , paul cally , manuel collados , and ashley crouch for their examination and suggestions to an early version of this paper .",
    "this work used lapalma supercomputer at centro de astrofsica de la palma and marenostrum supercomputer at barcelona supercomputing center ( the nodes of spanish national supercomputing center ) .",

    "<S> the conversion of fast waves to the alfvn mode in a realistic sunspot atmosphere is studied through three - dimensional numerical simulations . an upward propagating fast acoustic wave </S>",
    "<S> is excited in the high-@xmath0 region of the model . </S>",
    "<S> the new wave modes generated at the conversion layer are analyzed from the projections of the velocity and magnetic field in their characteristic directions , and the computation of their wave energy and fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis reveals that the maximum efficiency of the conversion to the slow mode is obtained for inclinations of 25 degrees and low azimuths , while the alfvn wave conversions peaks at high inclinations and azimuths between 50 and 120 degrees . </S>",
    "<S> downward propagating alfvn waves appear at the regions of the sunspot where the orientation of the magnetic field is in the direction opposite to the wave propagation , since at these locations the alfvn wave couples better with the downgoing fast magnetic wave which are reflected due to the gradients of the alfvn speed . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations shows that the alfvn energy at the chromosphere is comparable to the acoustic energy of the slow mode , being even higher at high inclined magnetic fields . </S>"
