    "in most fields of study , knowledge is acquired by way of observations , by reasoning about the results of observations and by studying the observations , methods and theories of other fields and practices .",
    "ancient egyptian , babylonian and chinese mathematics consisted of rules for measuring land , computing taxes , predicting eclipses , solving equations and so on .",
    "the ancient greeks found that in arithmetic and geometry it was possible to _ prove _ that observation results are true .",
    "they found that some truths in mathematics were _ obvious _ and that many of the others could be shown to follow logically from the obvious ones .    on the other hand , physics , biology , economics and other sciences",
    "_ discover general truths _ relying on observations .",
    "besides , not any general truth can be proved to be true - it can only be tested for contradictions and inconsistencies . if a scientific theory is accepted because observations have agreed with it ,",
    "there is in principle small doubt that a new observation will not agree with the theory , even if all previous observations have agreed with that theory .",
    "however , if a result is proved thoroughly and correctly , that can not happen .    under what conditions",
    "can we be sure that the steps in our investigations are correct ?",
    "are we really sure that what seems to be obvious to us is in fact true ?",
    "can we expect _ all _ mathematical truths to follow from the obvious ones ? these questions are not easily answered .",
    "disputes and mistakes about what is obvious could be avoided by laying down certain basic notions , relations and statements , called _ axioms _ ( postulates assumed true , but unprovable ) for each branch of mathematics , and agreeing that proofs of assertions must be derived from these .",
    "to axiomatize a system of knowledge means to show that its claims can be derived from a small , well - understood set of axioms ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the axiomatic system is subordinated to some conditions .",
    "* the system must be consistent , to lack contradiction , i. e. the ability to derive both a statement and its negation from the system s axioms .",
    "+ consistency is a necessary requirement for the system . *",
    "each axiom has to be independent , i. e. not a theorem that can be derived from other axioms in the system .",
    "+ however , independence is not a necessary requirement for the system . * the system can be complete , i. e. for every statement , either itself or its negation is derivable .",
    "there is no longer an assumption that axioms are _ true in any sense _ ; this allows parallel mathematical theories to be built on alternate sets of axioms ( for instance _",
    "axiomatic set theory , number theory _ ) .",
    "_ euclidean _ and _ non - euclidean geometry _ have a common basic set of axioms ; the differences between these important geometries are based on their alternate axioms of parallel lines .    another way to avoid mistakes about what is obvious in mathematics could be the use of rules of inference with purely formal content .    in mathematical logic a propositional calculus ( also called sentential calculus or sentential logic )",

    "in section 3 of the paper we propose _ direct proofs _ of lehmus - steiner s theorem that differ from any we have come across .",
    "our investigations in this field are appropriate for training of mathematics students and teachers .",
    "both discovery and proof are integral parts of problem solving .",
    "the _ discovery _ is thinking of possible solutions , and the _ proving _ ensures that the proposed solution actually solves the problem .",
    "_ proofs _ are logical descriptions of deductive reasoning and are distinguished from inductive or empirical arguments ; a proof must demonstrate that a statement is always true ( occasionally by listing all possible cases and showing that it holds in each ) .",
    "an unproven statement that is believed true is known as a _",
    "conjecture_.    the _ objects _ of proofs are premises , conclusions , axioms , theorems ( propositions derived earlier from axioms ) , definitions and evidence from the real world .    the abilities ( techniques ) to have a working knowledge of these objects include    * rules of inference : simple valid argument forms .",
    "they may be divided into _ basic rules _ , which are fundamental to logic and can not be eliminated without losing the ability to express some valid argument forms , and _ derived rules _ , which can be proven by the basic rules .",

    "the concept of a proof is formalized in the field of mathematical logic .",

    "a formal proof is defined as a sequence of formulas in a formal language , in which each formula is a logical consequence of preceding formulas .    in a formal proof the statements @xmath5 and @xmath6 are nt necessarily related comprehensively to each other .",
    "only the structure of the statements and the logical rules that allow the deduction of conclusions from premises are important .",
    "hence , to prove formally that an argument @xmath6 is valid or the conclusion follows logically from the hypotheses @xmath5 , we have to    - assume the hypotheses @xmath5 are true ,    - use the formal rules of inference and logical equivalences to determine that the conclusion @xmath6 is true .",
    "the following logical equivalences illustrate a formal proof : @xmath9    * vacuous proof . *",

    "a direct proof is a way of showing the truth or falsehood of a given statement by a straightforward combination of established facts , usually existing lemmas and theorems .",
    "the methods of proof of these established facts , lemmas , propositions and theorems are of _ no importance_. their truth or falsehood are to be accepted _ without any effort_.    however , it is exceptionally important that the actual proof of the given statement consists of straightforward combinations of these facts _ without making any further assumptions_.    thus , to prove an implication @xmath7 directly , we assume that statement @xmath5 holds and try to deduce that statement @xmath6 _ must _ follow .",
    "the structure of the direct proof is :    * _ given _ - a statement of the form @xmath7 .",
