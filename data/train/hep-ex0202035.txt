    "much of the present knowledge of the structure of the photon has been obtained from measurements of the photon structure function in deep - inelastic electron - photon scattering at colliders , see  @xcite for a recent review . the large statistics and high electron energies of the full lep2 programme",
    "permit the extension of the measurement of to higher values of than have been probed at lep1 .",
    "the photon structure function is expected to increase only logarithmically with  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the large range of values accessible at lep , which extends from about 1  to several thousand  , makes it an ideal place to study the evolution .",
    "the measurement of in interactions is based on the deep - inelastic electron - photon scattering reaction , @xmath62 , proceeding via the exchange of a virtual photon , @xmath63 , where the symbols in brackets denote the four - momentum vectors of the particles .",
    "the flux of quasi - real photons can be calculated using the equivalent photon approximation  @xcite .",

    "the usual dimensionless variables of deep inelastic scattering , @xmath0 and @xmath66 , are defined as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , and is the fine structure constant .",
    "the structure function is related to the charge - weighted sum of the parton densities of the photon ( see _ e.g. _",
    "@xcite ) . in the kinematic region of low values of @xmath66 studied ( @xmath69 ) the contribution of the term proportional to the longitudinal structure function is negligible  @xcite .",
    "the analysis presented here is based on 632  of data at centre - of - mass energies of 183 to 209  gev , with a luminosity weighted average of @xmath70  gev , taken by the opal experiment in the years 19972000 .",

    "the central tracking system is located inside a solenoidal magnet which provides a uniform axial magnetic field of 0.435  t along the beam axis axis points towards the centre of the lep ring , the @xmath66 axis upwards and the @xmath71 axis in the direction of the electron beam . in this paper the polar angle @xmath72 is defined with respect to the closest orientation of the @xmath71 axis . ] .",
    "the magnet is surrounded by a lead - glass electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) and a hadronic sampling calorimeter ( hcal ) . outside the hcal",
    ", the detector is surrounded by muon chambers .",
    "there are similar layers of detectors in the endcaps .",
    "the region around the beam pipe on both sides of the detector is covered by the forward calorimeters and the silicon - tungsten luminometers .",
    "starting with the innermost components , the tracking system consists of a high precision silicon microvertex detector  @xcite , a precision vertex drift chamber , a large - volume jet chamber with 159 layers of axial anode wires , and a set of @xmath71 chambers used to improve the measurement of the track coordinates along the beam direction .",
    "the transverse momenta of tracks with respect to the @xmath71 direction of the detector are measured with a precision of @xmath73 ( in gev ) in the central region , @xmath74  mrad .",
    "the jet chamber also provides energy loss , , measurements which are used for particle identification .",
    "the ecal covers the complete azimuthal range for polar angles that satisfy @xmath75  mrad .",
    "the barrel section , which covers the range @xmath76  mrad , consists of a cylindrical array of 9440 lead - glass blocks with a depth of @xmath77 radiation lengths .",
    "the endcap sections ( ee ) consist of 1132 lead - glass blocks with a depth of more than @xmath78 radiation lengths , covering angles in the range @xmath79  mrad .",
    "the electromagnetic energy resolution of the ee calorimeter is about @xmath80  ( @xmath81 in gev ) at polar angles above 350  mrad , but deteriorates closer to the edge of the detector .",
    "the forward calorimeters ( fd ) at each end of the opal detector consist of cylindrical lead - scintillator calorimeters with a depth of 24 radiation lengths divided azimuthally into 16 segments .",
    "the electromagnetic energy resolution of the fd calorimeter is about @xmath82  ( @xmath81 in gev ) .",
    "the clear acceptance of the forward calorimeters covers the range @xmath83  mrad .",
    "three planes of proportional tube chambers at 4 radiation lengths depth in the calorimeter measure the directions of showers with a precision of approximately 1  mrad .",
    "the silicon tungsten detectors ( sw )  @xcite at each end of the opal detector lie in front of the forward calorimeters .",
    "their clear acceptance covers a polar angular region between 33 and 59  mrad .",
    "each sw calorimeter consists of 19 layers of silicon detectors and 18 layers of tungsten , corresponding to a total of 22 radiation lengths .",
    "each silicon layer consists of 16 wedge - shaped silicon detectors .",
    "the electromagnetic energy resolution is about @xmath84 ( @xmath81 in gev ) .",
    "the radial position of electron showers in the sw calorimeter can be determined with a typical resolution of 0.06 mrad in the polar angle @xmath72 .",
    "the interactions of two photons are classified according to the virtualities of the photons . for this",
    "analysis photons with a virtuality of less than 4.5  are called quasi - real photons , @xmath85 , and the other photons are virtual photons , . as a shorthand ,",
    "events caused by the interactions of the three possible combinations are called , and events .    to measure , the distribution of events in @xmath0 and is needed .",
    "these variables are related to the experimentally measurable quantities @xmath86 , and by @xmath87 and @xmath88 where is the energy of the beam electrons , and are the energy and polar angle of the deeply inelastically scattered ( or ` tagged ' ) electron , is the invariant mass squared of the hadronic final state , and @xmath89 is the negative value of the virtuality of the quasi - real photon . the requirement that the electron associated with the quasi - real photon is not seen in the detector ( anti - tag condition ) ensures that @xmath90 , so is neglected when calculating @xmath0 from equation  [ eqn : xcalc ] .",
    "the electron mass is neglected throughout .",
    "three samples of events are studied in this analysis , classified according to the subdetector in which the scattered electron is observed .",
    "electrons are measured using the sw , fd and ee detectors .",
    "events are selected by applying cuts on the scattered electrons and on the hadronic final state .",
    "a scattered electron is selected by requiring @xmath91 and polar angles @xmath92  mrad for the sw / fd / ee samples .",
    "for the sw sample the energy cut effectively eliminates events originating from random coincidences between off - momentum beam electrons faking a scattered electron and untagged events  @xcite . for the ee sample special measures",
    "have to be taken to avoid fake electron candidates . to remove electron candidates originating from energetic electromagnetic calorimeter clusters stemming _",
    "e.g. _  from hadronic final states in the reaction , an isolation cut is applied which requires that less than 3  is deposited in a cone of 500  mrad half - angle around the electron candidate ( electron isolation cut ) .    to ensure that the virtuality of the quasi - real photon is small , the highest energy electromagnetic cluster in the hemisphere opposite to the one containing the scattered electron must have an energy @xmath93 ( the anti - tag condition ) . to reject background from deep - inelastic scattering events with leptonic final states ,",
    "the number of tracks in the event passing quality cuts  @xcite and originating from the hadronic final state , , must be at least three / three / four for the sw / fd / ee samples , of which at least two tracks must not be identified as electrons , based on the energy - loss measurement in the jet chamber .",
    "the tracks and the calorimeter clusters are reconstructed using standard opal techniques  @xcite which avoid double counting the energy of particles that produce both tracks and clusters .",
    "the visible invariant mass of the hadronic system is calculated from tracks and calorimeter clusters , including contributions from energy measured in the sw and fd calorimeters . for the ee sample , because of the high probability that the scattered electron will shower in the dead material ( ranging from @xmath94 radiation lengths ) in front of the ee calorimeter , energy deposits close to the electron are likely to belong to the electron .",
    "therefore , for this sample , all tracks and clusters within a cone of 200  mrad half - angle about the direction of the electron candidate are excluded from the calculation of . to remove the region dominated by resonance production and to reject the background from ,",
    "the measured is required to be in the range @xmath95  for the sw / fd / ee samples .",
    "the stronger cut on applied to the ee sample reflects the fact that the background from is larger for this sample than for the other samples .",
    "the cuts applied to each sample are listed in table  [ tab : cuts ] .",
    "the numbers of events in each sample passing the cuts are listed in table  [ tab : samples ] , together with the numbers of signal events after subtracting the background contributions described below .",
    "trigger efficiencies were evaluated from the data using sets of separate triggers , and were found to be larger than @xmath96 for events within the selection cuts .",
    "monte carlo programs are used to simulate signal events and to provide background estimates .",
    "all monte carlo events are passed through the opal detector simulation  @xcite and the same reconstruction and analysis chain as used for real events .",
    "the monte carlo generators used to simulate signal events are herwig 5.9+(dyn )  @xcite , phojet 1.05  @xcite and the vermaseren program  @xcite .",
    "the main reason for using a second monte carlo together with herwig is to have an additional model that contains different assumptions for modelling the hard scattering and the hadronisation process .",
    "herwig is a general purpose monte carlo program which includes deep inelastic electron - photon scattering .",
    "the herwig 5.9+(dyn ) version uses a modified transverse momentum , , distribution for the quarks inside the photon for hadron - like events . the upper limit of the distribution is dynamically ( dyn ) adjusted according to the hardest scale in the event , which is of order .",
    "this version was found to better describe the observed hadronic final states in three of the lep experiments  @xcite than the original version herwig 5.9 . in herwig",
    "the cluster model is used for the hadronisation process .",
    "phojet simulates hard interactions through perturbative qcd and soft interactions through regge phenomenology , and the hadronisation is modelled by jetset  @xcite .",
    "since it is recommended by the authors to use phojet only for values smaller than about 50  , the vermaseren model is used for the ee sample .",
    "the vermaseren program is based on the quark - parton model ( qpm ) and the quark masses assumed in the event generation are 0.325  gev for @xmath97 and 1.5  gev for c quarks . for each monte carlo sample",
    "the generated integrated luminosity is at least 10 times that of the data .",
    "the herwig and phojet samples were generated using the leading order grv  @xcite parameterisation of , taken from the pdflib library  @xcite , as the input structure function .",
    "this version assumes massless charm quarks .",
    "since phojet is not based on the cross - section formula for deep inelastic electron - photon scattering , the program always produces the same @xmath0 and distributions independent of the input structure function .",
    "therefore the @xmath0 distribution of phojet was reweighted to match that from herwig , as described in  @xcite .",
    "this is not a strong limitation , because the main emphasis lies on the alternative hadronisation model .",
    "the result of the unfolding procedure is expected to be almost independent of the actual underlying @xmath0 distribution of the monte carlo sample used .",
    "the numbers of expected signal events from the herwig program are listed in table  [ tab : samples ] .",
    "for the sw and fd samples the dominant background comes from the reaction @xmath98 proceeding via the multiperipheral diagram  @xcite .",
    "this was simulated using the vermaseren program .",
    "in contrast , for the ee sample the dominant background stems from the reaction , which was simulated using pythia  @xcite .",
    "the next largest backgrounds are @xmath98 followed by non - multiperipheral four - fermion events with @xmath99 final states ( denoted by 4-fermion eeqq ) , which were simulated with grc4f  @xcite , and , which was simulated with the kk  @xcite program . because the aim is to measure the structure function of the quasi - real photon , events stemming from the interaction of two virtual photons with hadronic final states are also treated as background . for the sw and fd samples these",
    "were generated using phojet 1.10 with the virtualities of both photons restricted to be above 4.5  . for the ee sample they have been estimated using the vermaseren program .",
    "the contribution to the background due to all other standard model processes was found to be negligible in all the samples .",
    "the numbers of events from the dominant background sources for each data sample are listed in table  [ tab : samples ] .",
    "monte carlo samples are used in an unfolding procedure to extract the differential cross - section and from the data .",
    "therefore , apart from explicit effects due to the variation of the structure function , a good description of the data distributions by the monte carlo is needed both for electron variables , which are used to measure , and for hadronic variables , which determine .",
    "the analysis of the sw sample closely follows that presented in  @xcite but includes three times the data integrated luminosity .",
    "the quality of the description of this sample is similar to that presented in  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the fd and ee samples at lep2 energies is new .",
    "figures  [ fig : fig01 ] and  [ fig : fig02 ] show comparisons between data and monte carlo distributions for these two samples .",
    "the quantities shown are ( a ) / , the energy of the scattered electron as a fraction of the energy of the beam electrons , ( b ) , the polar angle of the scattered electron , ( c ) , the number of tracks originating from the hadronic final state , and ( d ) , the measured invariant mass of the hadronic final state . the fd sample , figure  [ fig : fig01 ] , is compared to the monte carlo prediction of the herwig and phojet ( without reweighting of the @xmath0 distribution ) signal events together with background estimates .",
    "the phojet sample has been normalised such that the predicted number of events for the sw sample is the same as that of herwig , so the phojet distributions only allow for a shape comparison .",
    "the herwig monte carlo model predicts slightly fewer events than are observed in the data and , in general , the shapes of the data distributions are better described by herwig than by phojet .",
    "the ee sample , figure  [ fig : fig02 ] , is compared to the monte carlo prediction of the herwig and vermaseren signal events together with background estimates .",
    "the data distributions of the energy and polar angle of the scattered electron are well described by the monte carlo predictions . for the variables related to the hadronic final state",
    "there are apparent differences in shape .",
    "the hadronic energy flow for the sw sample has been studied in  @xcite . on average , about 5@xmath100 of the energy is deposited in sw , and about 20 - 25@xmath100 in fd and sw combined .",
    "the numbers for the fd and ee sample are even lower .",
    "it was verified that scaling the energy in the forward region has a small impact on the measured for @xmath101 .",
    "consequently , in the present analysis this energy is not scaled .",
    "the quantity , obtained from and , is shown in figure  [ fig : fig03 ] for the three samples .",
    "it should be noted that for the sw sample , for @xmath102 , the herwig model using the grv parameterisation of qualitatively follows the data , which means that the found from the data should be similar to the expectation from grv .",
    "in contrast , for the fd sample for @xmath103 the herwig prediction is systematically lower than the data . due to",
    "the shortcoming of the phojet model discussed above , the description of the distribution is unsatisfactory when using the phojet model without reweighting of the @xmath0 distribution . for the ee sample",
    "the difference in shape of the distribution is reflected in the observed difference between the data and both monte carlo models for the distribution .",
    "the differential cross - section and the structure function are obtained from the data by unfolding the distribution of the ee sample , after applying additional cuts on .",
    "the main problem in measurements of at low @xmath0 , i.e.  @xmath104 , is the dependence of on the monte carlo modelling , which enters when the unfolding process is used to relate the visible distributions to the underlying @xmath0 distribution .",
    "this problem is less severe at medium to large values of @xmath0 , in particular for the high ee sample , where the hadronic final state has much more transverse momentum and as a consequence is better contained in the detector .",
    "therefore the correlation between the measured invariant mass and the true @xmath86 , _",
    "e.g. _  as given by herwig , is much better at large @xmath0 , so the results can be expected to have a smaller dependence on the monte carlo modelling of the hadronic final state .    no attempt has been made in this analysis to access the region of @xmath104 , so using a one dimensional unfolding on a linear scale in @xmath0 is appropriate , in contrast with  @xcite . for this purpose",
    "the run program  @xcite has been used .",
    "technically , run uses a set of monte carlo events which are based on an input and carry the information about the correlation of and @xmath0 .",
    "a continuous weight function is defined which depends only on @xmath0 .",
    "this function is constructed from individual weight factors for each monte carlo event .",
    "these weight factors are obtained by fitting the distribution of the monte carlo sample to the measured distribution of the data , such that the reweighted monte carlo events describe the distribution of the data as well as possible . after the unfolding the two distributions are consistent .",
    "the unfolded from the data is then obtained by multiplying the input of the monte carlo with the weight function . for further details the reader",
    "is referred to  @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated in  @xcite that this procedure is independent of the input structure function used in the monte carlo .",
    "radiative corrections and the dependence of on are treated as in the previous opal analysis  @xcite .",
    "the radiative corrections applied to the data have been estimated using the radeg program  @xcite .",
    "they are obtained for each bin in @xmath0 and using the sas1d  @xcite prediction of .",
    "no correction for the effect of non - zero has been made , see refs .",

    ". the average value of of the data samples as predicted by the herwig program is about 0.2  .",
    "note however that herwig does not take into account the dependence of .",
    "after subtraction of background , the ee sample has been unfolded using three bins in @xmath0 spanning the range @xmath105 and for @xmath106  .",
    "the central values are obtained using herwig as the input monte carlo model for the unfolding .",
    "each data point is corrected for radiative effects as described above .",
    "bin - centre corrections are also applied as given by the average of the grsc  @xcite , sas1d and whit1  @xcite predictions for the correction from the average over the bin to the value of at the nominal @xmath0 position .",
    "the result for is shown in figure  [ fig : fig04 ] and listed in table  [ tab : results ] together with the correlation matrix . in each bin of @xmath0",
    "the result for is also listed .",
    "the values are corrected to the phase space given by the range and @xmath107 .",
    "systematic errors are estimated by repeating the unfolding with one parameter varied at a time and determining the shift in the result .",
    "the systematic errors are combined by adding all individual contributions in quadrature separately for positive and negative contributions .",
    "the systematic effects considered for the ee sample are :    model dependence : + the dependence on the monte carlo model used in the unfolding has been estimated by repeating the unfolding using the vermaseren sample and taking the full difference as the systematic error , both for the positive and negative error .",
    "variations of cuts : + the composition of the selected events was varied by changing the cuts one at a time .",
    "the size of the variations reflect the resolution of the measured variables and the description of the data by the monte carlo models around the cut values .",

    "the variations made are listed in table  [ tab : cuts ] .",
    "unfolding parameters : + the number of bins used for the measured variable can be different from the number used for the true variable .",
    "the standard result has 5 bins in the measured variable .",
    "this was in turn reduced to 4 and increased to 6 to estimate the systematic effects of the unfolding .",
    "calibration of the tagging detector : + the energy of the scattered electron in the monte carlo samples was conservatively scaled by @xmath108  @xcite .",
    "measurement of the hadronic energy : + the main uncertainty is in the calibration of the response of the electromagnetic calorimeter to hadronic energy for low energy particles in the hadronic final state .",
    "the absolute energy scale was varied by @xmath109  @xcite in the monte carlo samples .",
    "background modelling : + to quantify the uncertainty on the most dominant background , stemming from the reaction , the kk program along with cluster fragmentation from herwig has been used instead of pythia with string fragmentation .",
    "cone size for the calculation : + the size of the exclusion cone for the calculation of 200  mrad half - angle about the direction of the scattered electron has been varied by @xmath110  mrad .",
    "the size of the contributions to the error from the individual sources is similar and no single source is dominant . when combining all error sources , the total estimated systematic error is of the same order as the statistical error .",
    "the measured , shown in figure  [ fig : fig04 ] together with several theoretical calculations , exhibits a flat behaviour .",
    "the leading order parameterisations of from grsc , sas1d and whit1 , which all include a contribution from massive charm quarks , are described in detail in  @xcite .",
    "the contribution from bottom quarks is negligible .",
    "it can be seen that in this high regime the differences between these predictions are moderate , particularly in the central @xmath0-region .",
    "all these predictions are compatible with the data to within about 20@xmath100 , with the whit1 parameterisation , which predicts the flattest behaviour , being closest to the data .",
