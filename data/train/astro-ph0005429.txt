    "sax  j1808.43658 was discovered with the bepposax wide field cameras , wfcs , in september 1996 when the source underwent a @xmath2  day outburst ( int zand et al .",
    "the type i x - ray bursts that were detected during the outburst ( int zand et al .",
    "1998 ) testify that the source is to be classified among soft x - ray transients , sxrts , hosting an old neutron star ( for a review see campana et al .",
    "1998a ) . a distance of 4",
    "kpc was inferred from the peak flux of the x - ray bursts , under the assumption that this corresponds to eddington luminosity .",
    "for such a distance the september 1996 outburst reached a peak luminosity of @xmath3 .",
    "sax  j1808.43658 resumed activity in april 1998 at a maximum level of @xmath4 .",
    "pointed observations with the pca instrument on board rossixte revealed a @xmath5% modulation at a frequency of @xmath6  hz , the first fast coherent signal in the persistent emission of a neutron star low mass x - ray binary , lmxrb ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ) .",
    "pulse arrival time measurements yielded an orbital period of @xmath7  hr , a projected semimajor axis of @xmath8  light - ms and a mass function of @xmath9 , consistent with a very low inclination system hosting a light companion ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) .",
    "evidence for a @xmath7% modulation of the x - ray flux at the orbital period was also found ( chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) . the rossixte pca and hexte detected the source up to @xmath10  kev ; its spectrum was dominated by a power law - like component with photon index of @xmath7 ( an excess below 10  kev and a very gradual high energy cutoff above 35  kev were also present ) .",
    "the inferred column density was @xmath11  @xmath12 ( gilfanov et al .",
    "1998 ; heindl & smith 1998 ) .",
    "the evolution of the april 1998 outburst of sax  j1808.43658 , as monitored with the rossixte - pca down to luminosities of @xmath13 , showed a sudden steepening of the flux decay below @xmath14(gilfanov et al .",
    "1998 ) , reminiscent of the one seen from aql  x-1 ( campana et al .",
    "1998b ) . during this outburst the optical counterpart",
    "was unambiguously identified with a variable star that brightened to @xmath15 and displayed a 0.12  mag photometric modulation at the 2  hr orbital period ( roche et al .",
    "1998 ; giles et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the star s position is r.a.(2000 ) : 18h 08 m 27.54s and dec(2000 ) : 36@xmath16 58@xmath17 44.3@xmath18 . besides the bepposax",
    "/ wfc and rossixte positions , this is also consistent with the position of the radio transient source observed with atca ( gaensler , stappers & getts 1999 ) .",
    "the much celebrated discovery of 2.5  ms coherent pulsations in the persistent emission of sax  j1808.43658 ( wijnands & van der klis 1998 ; chakrabarty & morgan 1998 ) is the fruition of a two - decade long effort aimed at confirming evolutionary scenarios whereby old neutron stars in lmxrbs are among the progenitors of millisecond radio pulsars .",
    "periods in the ms range are predicted to result from secular spin - up by accretion torques .",
    "if the neutron stars of lmxrbs are endowed with a magnetic field in the @xmath19  g range , these are expected to shine as a recycled radio pulsar orbiting a low mass companion , once accretion onto them stops .",
    "the nearly coherent periodicities that have been detected during type i bursts from seven lmxrbs provided the first convincing evidence that the neutron stars in these systems are spinning at periods of 23 ms ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; for a review see van der klis 2000 ) .",
    "yet , only indirect arguments support the view that these neutron stars possess magnetic fields comparable to those of millisecond pulsars ( @xmath20  g ) .    by virtue of the coherent pulsations in its persistent x - ray flux sax",
    "j1808.43658 is currently the _ only _ fast spinning accreting neutron star in which the presence of a magnotosphere has been firmly established .",
    "the luminosity variations of the source , like those of most other x - ray transients , are large and allow to sample a variety of physical conditions that are not accessible to persistent sources .",
    "therefore sax  j1808.43658 can also provide crucial insights in the different regimes ( accretion , propeller and radio pulsar ) that are expected for weakly magnetic , fast spinning neutron stars subject to vastly different mass inflow rates .",
    "this letter presents the results of a bepposax observation of sax  j1808.43658 , the first to detect the source quiescent x - ray flux .",
    "a short account of this work was presented by campana ( 1999 ) .",
    "a pointed observation of sax  j1808.43658 with the narrow field instruments on board bepposax took place between 1999 march 17 , 18:48 ut and march 19 , 10:20 ut . due to a much reduced observational efficiency",
    "the effective exposure time was only 19503  s. x - ray images were obtained with two medium energy concentrator spectrometers , mecs , ( position sensitive proportional counters operating in the 1.310  kev band ; boella et al . 1997 ) and a low energy concentrator spectrometer , lecs , ( a thin window position sensitive proportional counter with extended low energy response , 0.110  kev ; parmar et al .",
    "1997 ) each in the focal plane of an x - ray telescope .",
    "these in turn consist of a set of 30 nested conical mirror shells providing an approximation to a wolter i type geometry ( conti et al . 1994 ) . due to uv contamination problems , the lecs was operated only at satellite night time , resulting in a shorter still exposure time ( 5495 s ) .    by virtue of their smaller point spread function and longer exposure time",
    ", the two mecs images afforded a considerably higher sensitivity than the lecs .",
    "the two mecs images were summed together and searched for point sources by using a sliding cell detection algorithm ( giommi et al .",
    "the 1.310  kev mecs image showed a fairly inhomogeneous and high background , likely dominated from diffuse ( and/or unresolved ) emission in the galactic centre region ( note that sax  j1808.43658 is at @xmath21 , @xmath22 ) . in order to improve the limiting sensitivity to point sources we accumulated a mecs image in the 1.34.3 kev energy band , where contamination from heavily absorbed emission from close to the galactic centre ( and beyond ) is less pronounced .",
    "this choice was also motivated by the fact that quiescent neutron star low mass x - ray transients are characterised by soft x - ray spectra .",
    "only one source was detected in the entire image , at a position of r.a.(2000 ) : 18h 08 m 33s and dec(2000 ) : 36@xmath16 57@xmath17 48@xmath18 , with a 90% uncertainty radius of @xmath23  arcmin due to low statistics and background inhomogeneities ( source a see fig .",
    "the position of this source is fully consistent with the optical counterpart of sax  j1808.43658 .",
    "the source count rate was @xmath24 in the 1.34.3 kev band and @xmath25 in the 1.310 kev band .",
    "the detection is highly significant ( chance probability of @xmath26 and @xmath27 in the 1.34.3 and 1.310  kev images , respectively ) .",
    "by contrast we note that in the 1.310 kev mecs image two additional sources are marginally detected the positions of which are in any case inconsistent with that of sax  j1808.43658 ( some @xmath28 arcmin away ) .",
    "no significant sources were detected in the lecs , nor in the collimated phoswich detector system , pds , ( 15300  kev , frontera et al .",
    "1997 ) .    to estimate the probability of finding by chance in our image an x - ray source at a position consistent with sax j1808.43658",
    ", we evaluated the limiting sensitivity of the central region of our sax mecs .",
    "this is @xmath29 erg @xmath12 s@xmath30 .",
    "based on the @xmath31 of x - ray sources close to the galactic center derived with einstein ipc ( 0.154.5 kev ) by hertz & grindlay ( 1984 ) , we estimate that the chance probability of detecting an x - ray source within a distance of @xmath32  arcmin ( the bepposax / mecs error radius ) from the optical position of sax  j1808.43658 is @xmath33% .",
    "we therefore conclude that the source a represents the quiescent counterpart of sax  j1808.43658 .",
    "photons were extracted from a circular region of radius of @xmath34 centered on the position of source a. this corresponds to an encircled energy of 90% .",
    "the @xmath35 photons extracted in this way were grouped according to their pha values so has to have at least 40 photons per channel .",
    "we determined that the standard bepposax / mecs background spectra obtained from blank field observations underestimate the background in the vicinity of sax  j1808.43658 by a factor of @xmath7 .",
    "therefore we directly estimated the background by using the photons from the annular region between 4.7 and 8  arcmin in the bepposax / mecs image of the sax  j1808.43658 field .",
    "given the small number of source photons ( @xmath36 after background subtraction ) the quality of the mecs spectrum is very poor .",
    "any simple single component model that we tried produced a good fit ; examples of this include : a power law with photon index @xmath37 , a black body with temperature @xmath38  kev or a thermal bremsstrahlung with temperature of @xmath39 kev ( all models are for a column density of @xmath40  @xmath41 ; uncertainties are 90% confidence for a single parameter ) .",
    "all models give a 0.510 kev unabsorbed flux of @xmath42 , which converts to a luminosity of @xmath43 . by adopting the `` canonical '' spectrum of quiescent sxrts , namely a soft black body component ( @xmath44 kev ) plus a power law hard tail with photon index @xmath7 ( campana et al .",
    "1998b ; asai et al .",
    "1998 ; campana et al . 2000 ) , the inferred unabsorbed 0.510  kev luminosity was also @xmath43 .    despite the small number of photons",
    ", we searched for the spin and orbital periodicities .",
    "the photon arrival times were first corrected to the barycentre of the solar system , and then to the barycentre of sax j18083658 , by using a coherence recovery technique and the orbital parameters obtained by chakrabarty & morgan ( 1998 ) .",
    "we then searched for the coherent signals by folding the data at the relevant period .",
    "we found no evidence for a modulation at the 2.5 ms spin period , nor the 2  hr orbital period .",
    "the corresponding upper limits to the amplitude of these modulations were in both cases close to 100% .",
    "moreover we found no evidence for aperiodic variability on timescales comparable to the duration of the bepposax observation .",
    "the bepposax observation reported here led to the discovery of quiescent x - ray emission from sax j1808.43658 . for a distance of 4 kpc , the inferred 0.510 kev luminosity is @xmath45 , well in the range observed in quiescent neutron star sxrts ( see e.g. campana et al .",
    "such an x - ray luminosity level is too high to result from coronal emission from the companion , likely a main sequence star of mass @xmath46  m@xmath47 ( see e.g. bildsten & rutledge 2000 ; campana & stella 2000 ) .    in the absence of detailed spectral information ,",
    "it is not possible to ascertain whether the quiescent x - ray emission of sax j1808.43658 comprises two distinct spectral components as in the best studied neutron star sxrts ( aql x-1 , campana et al .",
    "1998b and cen x-4 , asai et al .",
    "1998 , campana et al .",
    "these two components have been modelled in terms of a power law with photon index of @xmath7 plus a soft thermal - like spectrum with an equivalent blackbody temperature in the @xmath48  kev range ; they contribute comparable fractions of the 0.510 kev luminosity .",
    "if the quiescent x - ray spectrum of sax j1808.43658 comprised only the soft component , this might originate from the the release of thermal energy from the neutron star interior heated up during the accretion phases by steady burning , unless a pion condensate is present in the neutron star core ( campana et al .",
    "1998a ; brown , bildsten & rutledge 1998 ) .",
    "detailed modelling of thermal emission from the neutron star surface of a quiescent sxrt envisages a luminosity in the @xmath49  range and a complex x - ray spectrum emerging from the neutron star atmosphere , which might help reconciling the small blackbody equivalent radii inferred from the observations ( @xmath50  km ) with emission for the whole neutron star surface ( rutledge et al .",
    "alternative mechanisms have been proposed for the origin of the soft thermal - like emission from quiescent neutron star sxrts which will not be discussed here ( see e.g. campana & stella 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "on the other hand the analogy with other sxrts , suggests that an additional component with a harder spectrum and comparable luminosity ( the power law - like component ) likely characterises the quiescent x - ray emission of sax j1808.43658 .",
    "two alternative interpretations were proposed for the origin of this component , both of which involve the regimes expected for a fast rotating weakly magnetic neutron star as the mass inflow rate decreases by decades at the end of an outburst : these are the regime of accretion down to the magnetospheric boundary in the propeller regime , or shock emission from the interaction of the relativistic radio pulsar wind with the matter inflowing from the companion star ( stella et al .",
    "1994 ; zhang et al . 1998 ; menou et al .",
    "being the only neutron star low mass transient for which the presence of a magnetosphere is firmly established , sax  j1808.43658 provides a unique opportunity to test these interpretations .",
    "note that the idea that the soft x - ray component ( if present ) originates from the neutron star cooling is not in conflict with either of the models above ( or at least with some version of them ) .    the sudden steepening in the x - ray flux decay of sax  j1808.43658 below @xmath14  ( gilfanov et al .",
    "1998 ) is suggestive of the onset of the centrifugal barrier ( see also the case of aql  x-1 , campana et al .",
    "1998b ) . by using simple accretion theory to relate the accretion luminosity at the onset of the centrifugal barrier to the neutron star parameters ( e.g. eq .  1 in stella et al .",
    "1994 ) a magnetic field of @xmath51  g is inferred for a spin period of 2.5  ms .",
    "this value of b is within the range inferred by psaltis & chakrabarty ( 1999 ) ( @xmath52  g ) .",
    "the fact that the 401  hz pulsations were still observed for some time after this steepening might indicate that low level accretion occurs from higher latitudes , even in the propeller regime ( cui et al . 1998 ) .",
    "the expected luminosity jump from the neutron star accretion regime to the magnetospheric accretion regime across the centrifugal barrier is limited to a factor of @xmath53 for a 2.5  ms spinning neutron star ( corbet 1996 ) .",
    "simple theory predicts also that the ratio of maximum to minimum luminosity released by accretion onto the magnetospheric boundary in the propeller regime is @xmath54 , for a 2.5  ms spinning neutron star ( campana & stella 2000 ) .",
    "note that both @xmath55 and @xmath56 depend mainly on the neutron star spin period and are independent of the neutron star magnetic field .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the maximum accretion luminosity ratio from the beginning of the onset of the centrifugal barrier to the bottom of the propeller regime , is @xmath57 .",
    "( we adopted a spherical accretion approximation ; similar results are obtained in the case of a gas - pressure dominated disk interacting with the neutron star magnetosphere , see psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) .",
    "any additional luminosity resulting , e.g. , from the release of rotational energy of the neutron star in the propeller regime , would make this ratio smaller .",
    "the observed luminosity ratio between the sudden steepening in the outburst decay and quiescence in sax j1808.43658 is @xmath58 , seemingly too large of a value for the quiescent emission to be powered by accretion onto the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "this conclusion depends crucially on the identification of the steepening of the luminosity decay around @xmath14   with the onset of the centrifugal barrier , a point that is still uncertain despite the similarities with the case of aql  x-1 ( zhang et al .",
    "1998 ; campana et al .",
    "therefore the possibility that the propeller regime applies to the quiescent state of sax  j1808.43658 can not be ruled out .    in the alternative model",
    ", the radio pulsar regime applies and a fraction @xmath59 of the spin down luminosity @xmath60 can be released in the shock front between the relativistic pulsar wind and matter outflowing from the companion star , giving rise to an extended power law spectrum ( stella et al . 1994 ; tavani & arons 1997 ; campana et al .",
    "in this case the luminosity ratio between the beginning of the onset of the centrifugal barrier and the shock emission regime is @xmath61 for a 2.5 ms spinning neutron star ( here @xmath62 is the luminosity ratio between the minimum accretion luminosity in the propeller regime and the radio pulsar shock emission regime ) . for @xmath63 , a fairly high but still realistic value according to current models ( see tavani 1991 ) , the above ratio",
    "is easily reconciled with the factor of @xmath58 separating the measured luminosities at the steepening of the decay and in quiescence .",
    "differently stated , for the @xmath64  g neutron star magnetic field deduced if the action of the centrifugal barrier begins at @xmath14 , a shock luminosity of @xmath65would be expected , which for @xmath63 is in agreement with the quiescent x - ray luminosity measured from sax  j1808.43658 . currently available",
    "data therefore appear to favor somewhat the radio pulsar shock emission over the propeller interpretation .",
    "decisive evidence in favor of the radio pulsar interpretation could be obtained through the detection of a pulsed 2.5  ms signal in the quiescent x - ray flux of sax  j1808.43658 .",
    "high throughput x - ray observations would be especially useful in searching for this pulsed signal , as well as determining the characteristics of the quiescent x - ray spectrum .",
    "searches for pulsed radio emission , while somewhat eased by the independent knowledge of the spin period , are nevertheless hampered by large and presumably variable dispersion measure and free - free absorption ( see e.g. campana et al .",
    "we thank paolo giommi for his help with the optimisation of the ximage detection algorithm .",
    "this research made use of saxdas linearized and cleaned event files ( rev.2.0 ) produced at the bepposax sdc .",
