    "there are two nice descriptions of gauge theory from string theory , which we expect , in the end , to bring forth the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "one is a closed string on which the charge is distributed homogeneously and gives rise to the current algebra .",
    "this idea is realized by heterotic string , and by compactification on a suitable manifold , we obtain semi - realistic theories close to mssm .",
    "the other is open string description of type i and type ii strings .",
    "there the gauge degree of freedom , so called chan  paton factor , is assigned on the endpoints of open strings , whose modern understanding is provided by d - brane stacks , in the @xmath0-dual picture . in particular , the chiral fermions emerge on intersections of branes at angle @xcite .",
    "this provides the framework of a collection of models called intersecting brane world @xcite .",
    "the most unsatisfactory point of the brane picture has been the lack of understanding on unification , thus conventional models have resorted to bottom - up approach",
    ". however , if we consider string theory as the first principle from which we reduce our world , there must be _",
    "unification_. then the theory is consistent by construction . for instance , anomaly cancelation is automatically satisfied if we spontaneously break an unified theory , which is anomaly free by nature . also from the bottom ,",
    "the running gauge couplings from mssm and unification around @xmath4 gev @xcite is quite appealing . for the resulting low - energy vacua to be explained by spontaneous symmetry breaking",
    ", we should have an unified gauge group and coupling at the symmetry breaking scale . in this paper",
    ", we consider this possibility .",
    "the higgs mechanism via adjoint representation is easy to understand .",
    "the nonabelian gauge group is realized by a stack of coincident branes .",
    "their positions are denoted by matrix - valued vector @xmath5 also transforms as an adjoint .",
    "when they are diagonal in group space , the geometric information on d - branes translates to that on the gauge setup .",
    "there it is a wilson line @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the string tension . in general",
    "they represent a broken phase of @xmath8 . when some elements are same , or some branes are coincident , the gauge symmetry is enhanced to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the number of the same elements .",
    "we can see that the symmetry breaking corresponds to _",
    "brane separation_. the parallel branes are half - bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) system , thus parallel separation does not break further supersymmetries .",
    "also the d - flatness is not spoiled since d - term potential is given by @xmath11 ^ 2\\ ] ] from dualizing the gauge kinetic term .",
    "however to explain the chiral nature of matter fermions , we need intersecting branes . still in the intersecting case , the parallel separation moduli survive @xcite .",
    "however we have also a deformation between intersecting and parallel branes , known as _ recombination",
    "_ @xcite . in the non - supersymmetric case ,",
    "the instability is recovered by recombination , setteling down to minimal volume setup .",
    "however we see that if protected by supersymmetry , the recombination costs no energy .",
    "in this paper we consider compactifications on orbifold with suitable orientifold planes . to have supersymmetric models , we require some `` f - flatness '' condition , which is a generalization of self - dual condition @xcite .",
    "also we have the ramond  ramond ( rr ) charge conservation , realized as tadpole cancelation condition , which guarantees the absence of anomalies .",
    "we will see that every configuration satisfying these have the same energy , in particular , to type i compactification on the same orbifold .",
    "thus we naturally expect that also deformation along the flat directions could explain the spontaneous symmetry breaking of gauge group from _ type i compactification _ @xcite . during the recombination , although the intersection points , hence local chiralities , are changed , but the charge is conserved thus the total amount of anomalies is not affected .",
    "these points are examined in section 3 .",
    "such unification picture is also natural from the charge embedding , as to be discussed in section 2 in the modern d - brane picture . from quantization condition for tilted branes",
    ", charges are embedded into adjoint representations , which then belong to those of @xmath1 and a bifundamental representations occur as off - diagonal entries of them , like the @xmath12 bosons in georgi  glashow unification @xcite , for instance . in section 4 , we analyze the gauge coupling unification using fluctuation spectrum analysis of dirac  born  infeld ( dbi ) action @xcite .",
    "also we comment on the desirable weak mixing angle @xmath13 at the unification scale .",
    "we begin with the proper description of intersecting branes by embedding representations into an adjoint of nonabelian group .",
    "bifundamental representations can arise from branching of adjoints .",
    "they are the only possible representation from open strings .",
    "toron is a quantum of constant magnetic field on the torus @xcite .",
    "they are realized by various d - branes and their bound states .",
    "consider a d1-brane wrapping on a two torus @xmath14 in 12-directions .",
    "in string theory a torus @xmath14 as a target space is specified by two complex numbers , namely the complex structure @xmath15 and khler modulus @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 is the nsns antisymmetric tensor .",
    "it is equivalent to choice of basis vectors @xmath19 and a nsns field @xmath18 .",
    "this d1-brane is specified by two integral numbers @xmath20 , namely straightly winding @xmath21 times along @xmath22 directions respectively .",
    "we easily see that the cycle is of the minimal length for given @xmath20 and described as @xmath23 where @xmath24 with the string coupling @xmath25 , the identity matrix of rank @xmath26 and a constant @xmath27 .",
    "@xmath28 is interpreted as the relative angle to 1-direction .",
    "although we have a single cycle , we employed matrix structure in the group space in the spirit of ( [ adjhiggs ] ) .",
    "we regard it as a _ single _",
    "brane identified inside the torus , rather than @xmath26 slices of equally separated d - brane with permutation symmetry .",
    "this quantization arises by requiring _",
    "closedness _ of the brane , since it can only end on other d or ns branes , not on the empty space .",
    "although a homologous setup with @xmath26 parallel d1 branes along 1-direction and @xmath29 branes along 2-direction has the same charge , it is a different setup .",

    "although _ embedded _ in @xmath30 , the actual degree of freedom is smaller @xmath31 for @xmath32 .",

    ", there can be at most @xmath33 permutation symmetry @xmath34 in ( [ growvev ] )",
    ". it also means , having less permutation symmetry , we can break the above @xmath31 gauge group by parallel separation , adjusting constant matrix in ( [ qtz ] ) in analogy with the wilson line case ( [ adjhiggs ] ) .",
    "@xmath0-duality in 2-direction maps the two to d0 brane and d2 brane .",
    "two moduli are exchanged and @xmath35 .",

    "describe worldvolume @xmath30 gauge theory .",
    "this is the consistent solution satisfying the t hooft boundary condition @xcite .",
    "the condition ( [ qtz ] ) become quantization condition .",
    "@xmath37 with @xmath29 being integer , indeed , from vortex quantization . from the chern  simons coupling , the constant flux is interpreted as 0-brane charge  @xmath38 so we have @xmath29 d0-branes .",
    "this is interpreted as d0-d2 bound state and in fact d0 brane has melt into d2 brane , leaving the flux ( [ d0d2flux ] ) on it .",
    "this bound state is again 1/2 bps state @xcite .    by a series of @xmath39-dual",
    "there is a configuration where we have @xmath33 zero branes only on @xmath14 with the moduli space @xmath40 @xcite , thus we again see that the resulting gauge group is @xmath31 .",
    "describes gauge group @xmath41 , as a broken phase of @xmath42 due to the quantization condition ( a ) .",
    "a @xmath43 cycle , a double copy of ( 3,2 ) , generically has @xmath44 ( b ) , and can be enhanced to @xmath45 when branes are coincident ( c).,height=117 ]    note that @xmath0-dual in 12-direction , we exchange @xmath26 and @xmath29 , i.e. we have @xmath46 gauge symmetry with the first chern number @xmath26 .",
    "this symmetry is not visible in gauge theory since it only take into account k - theory charge , but natural in the sense it merely corresponds to exchanging coordinates @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "( in higher dimensional case , in the shrinking instanton limit , we see both gauge group . )",
    "thus even if we have @xmath41 gauge symmetry , the theory is naturally embedded in @xmath30 or @xmath46 gauge theory . in other words ,",
    "the natural embedding is _ nonabelian_.    a pair of parallel d1-branes can make further _ bound state _ between themselves , which is equivalent to _ one d1-brane winding twice _ the same cycle",
    ". the @xmath49 degree of freedom decouples and the low energy degree of freedom is @xmath41 gauge theory @xcite . for the above @xmath20 cycle , we see there is @xmath33 kinds of bound states .",
    "this bound state is not distinguishable , by the charge , or chern number .",
    "when we have more than one stacks in the same torus , we may generally have a number of cycles .",
    "the resulting toron background is expressed as @xmath50 without loss of generality , we can make the setup that each block satisfies the above condition ( [ toronqtz ] ) .",
    "however the important measure is the first chern number @xmath51 .",
    "it seems natural to embed the field strengths of all the stacks into a single nonabelian one . evidently , by the form of matrix , it is a higgs phase of @xmath52 generalizing ( [ adjhiggs ] ) .",
    "although this setup can not directly come from the single stack ( [ qtz ] ) , all of them can be regarded to reside specific points in moduli space of @xmath30 gauge theory .",
    "this is clear in the bound state picture that we have @xmath26 d2- and @xmath53 d0-branes forming @xmath54 bunch of bound states .",
    "how differently they can bound determines the setup .",
    "shortly we will see that there is an upper limit on @xmath29 and @xmath26 from the tadpole cancelation condition .    for general compactifications on @xmath55 or @xmath56",
    "orbifolds the unit torus is not rectangular but parallelogram with @xmath57 , to be compatible with orbifold group .",
    "this tilting is also required even if we can have rectangular tori , since intersection number accounting for the number of generations , is even in general , compared to the observed number , three . in a the case of our interest , worldsheet parity projection @xmath58 projects out antisymmetric nsns @xmath18 field .",
    "when we compactify it , @xmath18 field in the compact dimension can assume discretized , half - integral values @xmath59 modulo 1 @xcite .",
    "in the @xmath0-dual picture , this is the compatibility of orientifold action @xmath60 on torus , and @xmath61 modulo 1 . in the half - integral case ,",
    "the rr charge of orientifold is reduced by half , which leads rank and multiplicity reduction . for the @xmath62 case ,",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath63 in the literature , they are called a- and b - torus respectively . the angle condition is related to @xmath64 evidently , for the case of titled torus , the discussion is not changed if we replace a cycle number with a tilted one .      we can generalize the above idea to arbitrary dimensions .",
    "there are six two - cycles in four - torus , i.e. dim@xmath65 .",
    "they can also be represented by six integral numbers .",
    "in @xmath0-dual space , the system looks as d0-d4 bound states and the six numbers are related to chern numbers @xmath66 the @xmath67 denotes the @xmath68th chern numbers in @xmath0-dual picture , where we have d0 and d4 branes and the superscript denotes the direction .",
    "these numbers can be reshuffled by @xmath0-dualities @xmath69 , and with it we may make three of them to be zero @xcite . for convenience",
    "we will consider the factorizable cycle @xmath70 , which is understood as that of direct product of two - torus .",
    "however , the discussion will not be changed for the non - factorizable cycle .",
    "the cycles are denoted by three independent numbers @xmath71 therefore we have @xmath72 beside the multicomponent in the different directions , only the slight different is that the rank of each unit matrix is now @xmath73 .",
    "the slopes stay in the same form , but now they can be also expressed by chern numbers @xmath74 .",
    "again , we see that the system is naturally embedded into @xmath75 theory , where @xmath76 .",
    "note that the quantization condition requires the dimensions of diagonal blocks to be the same @xmath77 , although the slopes can be different .",
    "each describes one stack of branes . therefore , as in the parallel brane case , it seems natural and suggestive to embed all the branes into _ one representation _ and regard the subalgebra as a _",
    "broken phase_. we will see the upper limit of the rank will be given by tadpole cancelation condition .",
    "for the six dimensional case , the factorizable three cycle is represented as @xmath78    we can straightforwardly generalize such toron descriptions to an arbitrary number of extra dimensions .",
    "in such descriptions , all the information is contained in the chern numbers . as pointed out @xcite , these information can only take into account of k - theory charge ,",
    "not the cohomological information .",
    "so brane and antibrane is not distinguishable , but only the charge difference does . in this sense ,",
    "the description as ( [ toybg ] ) is far from complete .",
    "it can not describe a brane lying vertically on the torus @xmath79 nor antibrane cycle @xmath80 and , more severely , when the off - diagonal component of ( [ toybg ] ) is turned on , the corresponding cycle is not same as @xmath81 any more , resulting in different magnetic flux .",
    "measuring d - brane charge by cohomology rather than k - theory amounts to measuring a k - theory class by chern classes .",
    "one noticed that , for example , the @xmath12 gauge bosons in the conventional georgi ",
    "glasow @xmath82 unification @xcite have the correct quantum numbers , i.e. colors and weak isospins @xmath83 , as ( s)quarks .",
    "of course they do not have the desired @xmath41 hypercharges , but provided that they are also charged under additional @xmath41 symmetries , after diagonal symmetry breaking they may have the correct quantum numbers .",
    "we see that such structure can explain the bifundamental representation of mssm matters embedded into adjoint representations , which is the quantum number of a string stretched between branes localized at an intersection .",
    "consider a symmetry breaking @xmath84 .",
    "the case with more @xmath30 for @xmath85 is to be straightforwardly generalized by iteration . with a gauge choice we can take @xmath86 naturally @xmath87 . in @xmath88 dimension",
    ", the dirac spinor can be decomposed into two weyl representations @xmath89 note that this kind of decomposition is possible when we have @xmath88 extra dimensions . under the above gauge group @xmath85 , an adjoint fermion is naturally decomposed as @xmath90 in the group space . now solving dirac equation",
    ", we find the gauge transformation property of @xmath18 and @xmath91 are exactly bifundamentals @xmath92 , respectively .",
    "the solution is given by biperiodic function , the jacobi theta function .",
    "a detailed solution is discussed @xcite . the theory is _ chiral _ @xcite .",
    "this means , for example either quark @xmath93 or antiquark @xmath94 in ( [ su7adj ] ) will be exclusively massless .",
    "this can be seen by index theorem .",
    "it is well known that in the nontrivial background of solitons and instantons , the dirac operator ( [ diracop ] ) has _ chiral _",
    "zero modes .",
    "the dirac operator is decomposed as @xmath95 and , for @xmath88 extra dimensions , the chirality is correlated @xmath96 .",
    "the difference of the number of left and right mover zero modes , contributed from the @xmath97 and @xmath98 block , is the chern number , @xmath99 where the trace is over gauge charge @xmath100 of commutant group @xmath101 to @xmath85 , completely determined by branching and is on the @xmath97th and @xmath98th block . plugging ( [ bifund ] ) , we see that the each quark and lepton is chiral .",
    "moreover , there are @xmath102 degenerate bifundamental solutions for each off - diagonal solution .",
    "one can confirm that this is the same as intersection number @xmath103 of d - branes , which can explain the number of generations .",
    "it is determined by the topology of extra dimensions .",
    "note that gauge bosons of @xmath85 are always massless , nonchiral and non - degenerate . as the expression indicates ,",
    "in general there are massless chiral fermions , whereas the scalar partners are massless only when there is a supersymmetry .    a supporting evidence of this picture is suggested in the dual _",
    "m / f_-theory compactification @xcite .",
    "the intersection of d6 branes is purely geometrically described as unwinding of @xmath104 singularity singularity , to achieve the unwinding @xcite , which cope with the intersecting brane picture @xcite . ] to those of @xmath46 and @xmath30 and the bifundamental fermions come from the branching of the adjoint @xmath105 in the intersecting brane picture , a string stretched from @xmath29 brane stack to @xmath26 brane stack corresponds to _ chiral _ bifundamental representation @xmath106 , and the other string having the opposite orientation is @xmath107 conjugate due to the opposite gso projection @xcite .",
    "we will see that the class of vacua we will describe matches very well with @xmath108-theory picture , since we have only six dimensional objects , o6 and d6 , which will lift to the above singularities .",
    "a typical example is toy `` madrid model '' .",
    "the gauge group @xmath109 arises from breaking an unified group @xmath110 whose adjoint have the following charge assignment under the above subgroup @xmath85 , @xmath111 where the notations are self - explanatory ; the block - diagonal numbers refer to the dimensions of gauge bosons , and off - diagonal blocks correspond to complex squarks and sleptons and hermitian conjugates .",
    "we will see the fields corresponding to blank entries are massive .",

    ", we may put some of the blocks to different gauge field components than @xmath116 .",
    "the example ( [ su7adj ] ) thus is obtained as follows , where @xmath0-dual picture is more transparent .",
    "start with 7 slices of coincident branes , separate stacks with @xmath117 branes .",
    "then after rotating @xmath118 and @xmath119 branes , we obtain chiral spectrum .",
    "one can check @xcite that the commuting generators of @xmath120 represents unbroken gauge group and chiral quarks and leptons , exclusively not paired with the charge conjugate , indicated in ( [ su7adj ] ) .    in the effective field theory level",
    ", two ingredients made the above physics possible : extra dimensions and constant magnetic flux .",
    "this would motivate model construction as an effective theory .",
    "the above toy model is anomalous , which is not bad since we have not considered the complete theory yet .",
    "the best explanation for an anomaly free theory is that it is a spontaneously broken phase of a unified theory , in which the absence of anomaly is natural",
    ". the most suggestive scenario will be minimal , ten dimensional supergravity with nonabelian gauge group with dimension 496 @xcite .",
    "this suggests type i string theory with the gauge group @xmath1 , which is the only possibility if we want the perturbative open string description .    in the brane picture ,",
    "consistency is given by rr tadpole cancelation condition .",
    "it guarantees anomaly freedom of nonabelian gauge anomalies and of other mixed anomalies involving @xmath41 s by the generalized green  schwarz ( gs ) mechanism from antisymmetric tensor fields @xcite . for this",
    "we introduce an orientifold plane ( o - plane ) , a fixed plane under both worldsheet parity reversal @xmath58 and spatial reflection .",
    "the closed string exchange between d - branes ( represented by cylinder feynman diagram ) give rise to divergence , which is represented as tadpole diagram in the filed theory limit @xcite .",
    "the cylinder diagram is canceled by introducing the klein bottle and the mbius strip , which means nothing but the existence of an orientifold plane with rr charge 16 in terms of d - brane unit .",
    "an antibrane can be introduced to cancel tadpoles , but it spoils all the supersymmetry and brings about instability .    when branes ( and their images ) are on top of orientifold plane , the gauge group is @xmath121 type .",

    "the adjoint @xmath123 of @xmath124 can be embedded into @xmath125 @xmath126 for example , the above @xmath127 toy model is realized and embedded in @xmath128 , having almost same structure .",
    "since the final group is @xmath1 , so that in general we expect hidden sector @xcite .",

    "correspondingly , the image of d - brane with respect to such plane is @xmath143    this will set an upper bound of the rank of the gauge group .",
    "this property actually exists since the tadpole cancelation condition is the sum of rr charge vanish @xmath144 including orientifold plane .",
    "these are four conditions since we have 3 complex dimensions thus @xmath145 runs over @xmath146 .",
    "we will see that there are three cases that one , two and four of them is nonvanishing which is the same as the number of orientifold planes .",

    "it should be finite otherwise we have no physics to regulate in that direction . in this case , with a single orientifold plane , it is shown @xcite that there is no nontrivial supersymmetric setup , except one where all the d - branes are on top of orientifold plane .",
    "the constraint comes from the tadpole cancelation condition of both rr and nsns charges . before constraining tadpole condition",
    ", we have potentials for complex structure moduli and dilaton . from the cancelation condition of both",
    ", there arises an inequality which is only saturated only when the complex structure makes all the d - branes on top of o - plane .    for @xmath201",
    "even , the remaining divergence is proportional @xmath299 to @xmath300 , which manifestly shows that it is @xmath301-dual to the above divergence term , since it relates @xmath302 .",
    "this means , introducing 16 d5-branes in these direction cancels the divergence , and the requiring replacement @xmath303 shows again the @xmath0-duality .",
    "@xmath201 even has order 2 section and this harbors exactly such the o5 and d5 planes .",
    "it follows @xmath304    there is an extra piece from the cylinder amplitude proportional to @xmath305 only , which seems not has such @xmath0-duality , but it vanishes for an appropriate choice of @xmath306 basis .",
    "however other divergences arising from @xmath307 and @xmath308 orbifolds , proportional to @xmath309 can not be canceled .",
    "so these choices of orbifolds are not consistent for the symmetric orbifold compactification .",
    "we will see , however , these orbifolds can be consistent when we consider asymmetric orbifolds .    for @xmath310 orbifold , extra orientifold planes can emerge depending on whether such @xmath311 or @xmath55 contains order two element",
    ". we will see that we can have either one or four orientifold planes in total , if we take into account supersymmetry .",
    "the latter case is both @xmath312 even and contains the following @xmath313 orbifold group as a subgroup .",
    "it is generated by @xmath314 where @xmath315 thus we have a nontrivial order 2 element @xmath316 .",
    "each of them has a 5 + 1 dimensional fixed planes thus can harbor o5 plane . still in this case , now the @xmath317-lanes are labeled as @xmath210 , each divergence condition is exactly the same as ( [ o5div ] ) for each @xmath68th orientifold direction @xcite .    from these conditions",
    ", we can cancel the diagram and this give rise to conditions on the projection matrices @xmath306 , and applying these to ( [ cpprojector ] ) we have broken gauge group .",
    "they are determined without ambiguity .",
    "note that this will be given as branching rules .",
    "for example the compactification on the orbifold @xmath318 @xcite . and they are explained . there exists a discrete torsion which produces a different form of one loop amplitude @xcite , we will not consider it here .",
    "it follows that the @xmath130 groups can only appear as broken @xmath1 , which takes into account small instantons @xcite .",
    "for consideration of @xmath0-duality one should be careful to mention @xmath286 .",
    "it was noted in @xcite that @xmath0-duality flips sign asymmetrically to the left and the right mover , @xmath319 if we do @xmath0-dual odd times to a two - torus parameterized by @xmath320 which is as good as complex conjugation in @xmath0-dual space . then the orbifold action @xmath321 becomes asymmetric in @xmath0-dual direction @xmath322 the cases of @xmath142 and @xmath313 are exceptions , since @xmath323 is just a change of sign , so asymmetric orbifold is the same as symmetric orbifold .",
    "the orientifold group is @xmath324 , which changes into @xmath325 by @xmath0-duality in @xmath326 direction , whereas the orbifold group remains as @xmath286 .",
    "consider @xmath0-duality in @xmath327 direction , which is conveniently realized as @xmath328 now the orientifold group is @xmath329 , whereas the orbifold group @xmath286 remains invariant .",
    "it is easily checked that all the o9 and o5 planes becomes o6 planes , @xmath330 not intersecting among themselves .",
    "since this is the most nontrivial setup , this proves that every d@xmath33 and o@xmath33 planes can be mapped to d6/o6 planes , which are desirable in the @xmath108-theory dual picture .",
    "these planes are ( [ z2z2oplane ] ) .",
    "it is stressed that both pictures are equivalent .    for supersymmetric system",
    ", we can not have d - branes other than the o9/d9 and/or o5/d5 considered above .",
    "by @xmath0-duality , fixing one orientifold as o9 , let us then count the lower dimensional orientifolds . consider @xmath331 orbifold @xcite . for odd @xmath201 ,",
    "the only possible orientifold is o9 since there is no even order element in @xmath286 compatible with lower dimensional orientifold . for even @xmath201 , the only possibility other than o9 is o5 , because in order not to have a tachyon , the the difference of dimensions of d - branes should be a multiple of 4 .",
    "we can not put additional o1 , if we want four dimensional lorentz invariance .",
    "the number of o5 is always 1 , and it sits on the plane generated by order 2 element @xmath332 .",
    "the same is also applied to @xmath333 orbifolds , where the number of o5 can be up to 3 .",
    "other systems containing o@xmath33 and/or o@xmath334 can be @xmath0-dualized to the above models .",
    "one can see , for example the model considered by cvetic , shiu and uranga @xcite is deformable to the one by berkooz and leigh @xcite .",
    "both of them are based on @xmath335 orbifold compactification , defined above .",
    "the orbifold actions determine three @xmath336 dimensional hyperplanes and harbor o5 planes . with chan  paton projector ( [ cpprojector ] ) , the resulting gauge group is multiple of @xmath130 with integer @xmath54 , which is embedded in @xmath1 , for each o5 planes .",
    "it is @xmath1 because the product of the rr charge of o@xmath33 and the number of fixed points is always 16 . in the maximal group case ( without wilson lines , or when all the d - branes are on top of one orientifold planes ) we have only gauge group @xmath337 which will be the final unification group obtainable from brane deformations",
    ". nevertheless they are _ broken @xmath338 _ because the resulting 99 and @xmath339 spectra in @xcite can be explained by branching rules @xmath340 .",
    "note that we have @xmath0-dual symmetries exchanging o9 with one of the o5@xmath341 .",
    "therefore every gauge group arising from d@xmath33-d@xmath33 branes can be _ embedded into @xmath1 , for each orientifold planes_.    applying @xmath0-duality in 579 direction we have four o6 . by brane deformations , we can see the spectrum of @xcite consists of 1/4 cycles only and thus can be deformed to parallel branes on top of orientifold planes .",
    "we can always find the directions in which @xmath0-duality maps all o9,d9,o5,d5 to six dimensional objects : o6 and d6 .",
    "therefore we can lift of the model to @xmath108-theory on @xmath342 manifold picture , where the desirable objects are six dimensional objects in type iia theory , which become geometric objects , i.e. singularities .",
    "one may note that not every vacua might be connected , since the deformation of orbifold / orientifold images should be always deformed together .",
    "however it is strongly restricted by anomaly cancelation of representation as @xmath343 @xcite .",
    "all the above theory is to be interpreted as type i compactification , even if we had , in addition to o9 , more o5 planes hence additional gauge groups .",
    "it is analogous to the presence of also additional , twisted closed strings , which were not present in the untwisted theory .",
    "such extra orientifold sectors are required to cancel anomalies from twisted strings . thus depending on the number of o - planes we may meet more than one @xmath1 gauge groups and their adjoints , which are further broken by projection associated with orbifold actions .",
    "the maximal number is four for @xmath344 orbifold if @xmath312 are all even .",
    "the maximal gauge group is @xmath1 of type i , @xmath345 @xcite , @xmath337 @xcite with a single , two , four o - plane(s ) , respectively .",
    "so all the quarks and leptons are not necessarily belong to the same adjoint .",
    "the upper limit of the rank 32 constrains realistic models , for example the racetrack model , making use of high rank group .",
    "a situation is possible where there is no compact dimensions . in this case ,",
    "type i and type ii theories are indistinguishable since we can move off all the o@xmath33-planes @xmath346 to infinity , which is as good as having no o - planes at all .",
    "the only exception is the @xmath347 case discussed above , since o9 is space filling and in touch .",
    "we have considered the flat internal space ( with singularities ) , but we can consider a generic space such as calabi  yau . in a curved space ,",
    "the supersymmetric condition for intersecting branes is different and there is no ( or not clear ) isometry , so that the meaning of @xmath0-duality is not clear .",
    "it would be an interesting direction to find whether the tadpole condition still implies general supersymmetric open string theory to be @xmath0-dual to type i theory .",
    "the brane recombination is responsible for symmetry breaking and restoration . in particular ,",
    "if the local relation of supersymmetry is satisfied , there is no energy cost on the deformation .",
    "this connects the orbifolded theory to intersecting brane models . during recombination",
    "there is no change of the sum of rr charges of branes .",
    "since type i string theory is free of gauge and/or gravitational anomalies and k - theory anomalies , there is no anomalies in the low energy theory",
    ". this should be , since the latter is understood as spontaneously broken theory of the former .",
    "conceptually , it is not necessary to have grand unification at the intermediate scale .",
    "although we have a single gauge coupling , above unification scale , of type i string theory , we might have different gauge coupling due to tilted brane in the low energy , which is the original property of dbi action .",
    "such various gauge couplings do not require as many moduli , but arise from the nonabelian structure the magnetic fluxes possess .",
    "brane recombination changes the effective gauge couplings from the unified one , whose dynamics is at the scale of unification .",
    "gauge couplings can be set be equal by some symmetry , or their discrepancy may be cured from threshold corrections of magnetic fluxes . or , we might not need one meeting point of unification , running from the low energy . in the coupling unification limit",
    ", we have a desirable value of weak mixing angle @xmath348 at the unification scale .",
    "this is due to embedability of quantum numbers in @xmath3 .",
