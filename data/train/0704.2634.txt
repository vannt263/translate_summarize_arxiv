    "the classification problem for class vii surfaces is a very difficult , still unsolved problem . solving this problem",
    "would finally fill the most defying gap in the enriques - kodaira classification table . by analogy with the class of _ algebraic _ surfaces with @xmath8",
    ", one expects this class to be actually _ very small_. this idea is supported by the classification in the case @xmath9 , _ which is known _ : any class vii surface with @xmath9 is either a hopf surface or an inoue surface @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . on the other hand , solving completely the classification problem for this class of surfaces has been considered for a long time to be a hopeless goal ; the difficulty comes from the lack of lower dimensional complex geometric objects : for instance , it is not known ( and there exists no method to decide ) whether a minimal class vii surface with @xmath10 possesses a holomorphic curve , a non - constant entire curve , or a holomorphic foliation .    in his remarkable article",
    "@xcite nakamura , inspired by the previous work of kato ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and dloussky @xcite , stated a courageous conjecture , which would in principle solve the classification problem for class vii surfaces , as we explain below : +   + * the gss conjecture : * _ any minimal class vii surface with @xmath10 contains a global spherical shell . _",
    "+ we recall that a ( bidimensional ) spherical shell is an open surface which is biholomorphic to a standard neighborhood of @xmath11 in @xmath12 . a global spherical shell ( gss ) in a surface @xmath13 is an open submanifold @xmath14 of @xmath13 which is a spherical shell and such that @xmath15 is connected . minimal class vii surfaces which allow gss s ( which are usually called gss surfaces , or kato surfaces )",
    "are well understood ; in particular it is known that any such surface is a degeneration of a holomorphic family of blown up primary hopf surfaces , in particular it is diffeomorphic to such a blown up hopf surface . moreover , kato showed @xcite that any gss surface can be obtained by a very simple construction : first one considers a modification @xmath16 of the standard disk @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the blowing up at @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is obtained inductively by blowing up in @xmath21 a point of its ( -1)-curve .",
    "second , one performs a _ holomorphic surgery _",
    "@xmath22 to the resulting manifold @xmath23 in the following way : one removes a closed ball around a point @xmath24 belonging to the last exceptional curve of @xmath25 , and then identifies holomorphically the two ends of the resulting manifold ( which are both spherical shells ) . choosing in a suitable way the identification map @xmath26 , one gets a minimal surface .",
    "the isomorphism class of the resulting surface is determined by two parameters : the modification @xmath25 and the identification map @xmath26 .",
    "note however that kato s simple description of gss surfaces does not immediately yield a clear description of the moduli space of gss surfaces , because different pairs @xmath27 can produce isomorphic surfaces .",
    "nevertheless this shows that , in principle , the complete classification of gss surfaces can be obtained with  classical \" methods , so the gss conjecture would solve in principle the classification problem for the whole class vii . +",
    "the existence of a gss reduces to the existence of  sufficiently many curves \" .",
    "this is an important progress which is due to several mathematicians ( kato , nakamura , dloussky , dloussky - oeljeklaus - toma ) who worked on the subject in the last decades .",
    "more precisely one has    [ previousresults ]    1 .",
    "if a minimal class vii surface @xmath13 with @xmath28 admits @xmath29 rational curves , then it also has a global spherical shell .",
    "2 .   if a minimal class vii surface @xmath13 admits a numerically pluri - anticanonical divisor , i.e. a non - empty curve @xmath30 such that @xmath31 mod @xmath32 .",
    "then it also has a global spherical shell .",
    "[ cycleimplies ] if a minimal class vii surface @xmath13 admits a cycle of curves , then it is a global deformation ( a degeneration ) of a one parameter family of blown up primary hopf surfaces .    here by ",
    "cycle \" we mean either a smooth elliptic curve or a cycle of rational curves ( which includes a rational curve with an ordinary double point ) .",
    "the first statement is the remarkable positive solution  due to dloussky - oeljeklaus - toma @xcite  of kato s conjecture ; this conjecture had been solved earlier in the case @xmath1 by nakamura @xcite .",
    "the second statement is a recent result of g. dloussky @xcite , whereas the third is due to nakamura @xcite .",
    "this important theorem shows that , as soon as a minimal class vii surface @xmath13 with @xmath28 admits a cycle , it belongs to the  known component \" of the moduli space . + in our previous article @xcite we proved , using techniques from donaldson theory , that any class vii surface with @xmath1 has curves ; using the results of nakamura @xcite or dloussky - oeljeklaus - toma cited above , this implies that the global spherical shell conjecture holds in the case @xmath1 . since the gss surfaces in the case @xmath1 are very well understood , this solves completely the classification problem in this case .",
    "the method used in @xcite can be extended to higher @xmath6 , and we believe that , at least for small @xmath6 , it should give the existence of a cycle .",
    "our general strategy has two steps : +   + * claim 1 : * _ if @xmath13 is a minimal class vii surface _ with no cycle _ and @xmath28 , then , for suitable gauduchon metrics , the moduli space @xmath2 of polystable bundles @xmath3 on @xmath13 with @xmath33 and @xmath5 has a smooth compact connected component @xmath34 , which contains a non - empty finite subset of filtrable points . _",
    "+ @xmath2 is endowed with the topology induced by the kobayashi - hitchin correspondence from the corresponding moduli spaces of instantons .",
    "we will see that this moduli space is always compact ( see section [ topprop ] ) ; this is easy to see for @xmath35 , because in this case the lower strata in the uhlenbeck compactification are automatically empty @xcite .",
    "this moduli space is not a complex space , but its stable part @xmath36 is an open subset with a natural complex space structure .",
    "@xmath37 will be defined as the connected component of the _ canonical extension _",
    "@xmath38 , which , by definition , is the ( essentially unique ) non - split extension of the form @xmath39and is stable when @xmath40 and @xmath13 has no cycle of curves .",
    "the condition @xmath40 is not restrictive ; we will show that there exist gauduchon metrics with this property .",
    "+   + * claim 2 : * _ the existence of such a component @xmath37 leads to a contradiction . _ + both claims might be surprising , and one can wonder how we came to these statements .",
    "the first claim is an obvious consequence of the following more precise statement , which has been checked for @xmath41 : consider the subspace @xmath42 consisting of those stable bundles which can be written as a line bundle extension whose kernel ( left hand term ) has torsion chern class .",
    "+   + * claim 1@xmath43 : * _ if @xmath13 is a minimal class vii surface _ with no cycle _ and @xmath44 then , for a gauduchon metric @xmath45 with @xmath40 , the closure @xmath46 of @xmath47 in @xmath2 is open in @xmath2 and contains all filtrable polystable bundles except the bundles of the form @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "these bundles are stable but do not belong to @xmath46 . _",
    "+ this implies that the connected component @xmath37 of @xmath38 in @xmath2 is contained in the stable part and is a smooth compact manifold which contains a finite non - empty set of filtrable bundles , so it has the properties stated in claim 1 .",
    "+ the main purpose of this article is to show that our 2-step strategy works in the case @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we will prove the following result :    any minimal class vii surface with @xmath0 has a cycle of curves , so it is a global deformation of a family of blown up hopf surfaces .",
    "we explain now in a geometric , non - technical way how claim 1@xmath43 will be proved for @xmath0 .",
    "we suppose for simplicity that @xmath50 ; in this case the cohomology group @xmath51 is torsion free and , by donaldson s first theorem @xcite , is isomorphic to @xmath52 endowed with the standard negative definite intersection form .",
    "let @xmath53 be an orthonormal basis of @xmath51 such that @xmath54 consider first the spaces @xmath47 , @xmath55 of stable , respectively polystable extensions @xmath3 of the form @xmath56 with @xmath57 .",
    "it is easy to see that , under our assumptions , @xmath47 can be identified with @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the subset of line bundles satisfying the inequality @xmath60 .",
    "@xmath61 is a punctured disk .",
    "@xmath55 can be identified with the space obtained from the product @xmath62 by collapsing to a point each fiber over the circle @xmath63 .",
    "the circle @xmath64 of collapsed fibers is one of the two components of the subspace of reductions ( split polystable bundles ) @xmath65 .",
    "one also has two 1-dimensional families of extensions corresponding to the cases @xmath66 .",
    "when @xmath13 has no curve in the classes @xmath67 ( assume this for simplicity ! ) , the corresponding loci of polystable bundles @xmath68 can be identified with two punctured closed disks @xmath69 ; the subspaces @xmath70 of stable bundles of these types are identified with @xmath71 .",
    "there is a natural isomorphism between the two boundaries @xmath72 , and the points which correspond via this isomorphism represent isomorphic split polystable bundles .",
    "therefore , one has to glue the punctured closed disks @xmath73 along their boundaries and get a 2-sphere minus two points @xmath74 , which is the second piece of our moduli space . the circle @xmath75 given by the identified boundaries @xmath76 is the second component of @xmath65 .",
    "there are two more filtrable bundles in our moduli space , namely the two bundles of the form @xmath48 with @xmath49 .",
    "these bundles are stable under the assumption that @xmath40 and @xmath13 has no cycle .",
    "therefore we also have a 0-dimensional subspace @xmath77 of stable bundles .    using another classical construction method for bundles ,",
    "one gets two more points , namely the push - forwards @xmath78 , @xmath79 of two line bundles on a double cover @xmath80 of @xmath13 ( see section [ bicoverings ] ) .",
    "these points are fixed under the involution @xmath81 given by tensoring with the flat @xmath82-connection defined by the generator @xmath83 of @xmath84 .",
    "[ picture ]    under our assumptions ( lack of curves ! ) , the four pieces @xmath55 , @xmath74 , @xmath85 , @xmath86 are disjoint .",
    "note now that there is an obvious way to put together these pieces in order to get a compact space ( this looks like solving a puzzle ! ) : one identifies @xmath78 , @xmath79 with the missing points @xmath87 , @xmath88 of @xmath74 and afterwards puts the obtained sphere @xmath22 at the place of the missing fiber of the @xmath89-fibration @xmath90 ( see the picture nearby ) .",
    "the result is a topological space homeomorphic to @xmath91 .",
    "knowing that @xmath46 is obtained in the described way , it will be easy to prove that it is open and that it does not contain any bundle of the form @xmath48 .",
    "for the first statement it suffices to compare the local topology of our 4-sphere to the local topology of @xmath92 prescribed by deformation theory ; for the second it suffices to show that a bundle @xmath48 does not belong to any of the four pieces ; this follows easily using again our assumption concerning non - existence of curves .",
    "therefore , the idea of proving claim 1@xmath43 ( so also claim 1 ) is very clear : solving our puzzle game yields a compact component of the moduli space ; the two elements of @xmath93 _ are not needed _ in the construction of this compact component , so they belong to a new component ( or to two new components ) . however , the fact that our 4-sphere ( the space obtained solving the puzzle game in the most natural way ) is indeed the closure of @xmath47 is difficult to prove .",
    "the point is that one has absolutely no control on extensions of the form ( [ firstext ] ) when @xmath94 , because the volume of the section defined by @xmath95 in the projective bundle @xmath96 tends to @xmath97 as @xmath94 . in other words",
    ", there exists no method to prove that a certain family of extensions is contained in the closure of another family , so _ incidence relations between families of extensions are difficult to understand and prove_. this is one of the major difficulties in understanding the global geometry of moduli spaces of bundles on non - khlerian surfaces . the fact that the above construction gives indeed the closure of @xmath47 will follow from :    1 .",
    "[ itext ] the holomorphic structure of @xmath36 extends across @xmath75 ( see sect .",
    "[ general ] ) and , with respect to the extended holomorphic structure , the complement @xmath98 of @xmath55 in @xmath2 is a divisor .",
    "the circles @xmath64 and @xmath75 belong to the same component of the moduli space .",
    "this important result will be obtained using the donaldson @xmath99 class associated with a generator of @xmath100 and a gauge theoretical cobordism argument .",
    "we still have an important detail to explain : why did we use the two @xmath81-fixed points @xmath78 , @xmath79 in solving our puzzle ( which should produce the closure @xmath46 ) and not , for instance , the two filtrable elements of @xmath101 or two non - filtrable bundles ?",
    "the point is that the involution @xmath81 acts non - trivially on the divisor @xmath98 , which in our simplified case is a projective line .",
    "therefore this divisor contains the two fixed points of this involution . + note that without assuming @xmath50 the structure of our moduli space will a priori be slightly more complicated .",
    "two complications arise :    1 .",
    "@xmath46 contains a disjoint union of components @xmath102 associated with classes @xmath103 .",
    "it is difficult to prescribe the number of fixed points of the involution induced by @xmath81 on each component ( see section [ bicoverings ] ) .",
    "however one can easily prove that each component @xmath102 can be obtained from the product @xmath104 by collapsing the fibers over @xmath105 to points as above , and applying a ( possibly empty ) sequence of blow ups in points lying above the center of the disk .",
    "the fiber over this center will be a tree @xmath106 of rational curves , one of which , say @xmath107 , contains a circle of reductions and consists of extensions of types @xmath108 or @xmath109 and two fixed points of @xmath81 .",
    "this will slightly complicate our argument , because we will also have to rule out the case when the bundle @xmath110 belongs to an irreducible component @xmath111 of the tree @xmath106 .",
    "but we will see that such a component ( if it exists ) consists generically of non - filtrable bundles , so it suffices to apply corollary 5.3 in @xcite , which shows that there can not exist a family of rank 2-simple bundles over @xmath13 parameterized by a closed riemann surface which contains both filtrable and non - filtrable bundles .",
    "note that the existence of a cycle implies @xmath112 by nakamura s theorem ( see theorem [ previousresults ] , [ cycleimplies ] .",
    "above ) hence , a posteriori , the moduli space @xmath113 is just a 4-sphere , as explained above .",
    "the first section contains general results concerning moduli spaces of polystable bundles ( projectively asd connections ) on non - khlerian surfaces .",
    "these results will play an important role in the future attempts to solve the gss conjecture in its full generality .",
    "particular attention will be given to the topological properties of moduli spaces of projectively asd connections on general riemannian 4-manifolds with @xmath114 , and to the structure of these moduli spaces around the reduction loci .",
    "the second section is dedicated to the geometry of the moduli space @xmath36 in the case @xmath0 . in this section",
    "we will prove claim 1@xmath43 in full generality ( without any assumption on @xmath115 ) following the geometric ideas explained above .",
    "the following sections are dedicated to claim 2 : the appearance of a smooth compact component in the moduli space leads to a contradiction .",
    "this contradiction will be obtained in several steps as follows : in the third section we will show that the embedding @xmath116 has a universal family @xmath117 . this result will enable us in the fourth section to apply the grothendieck - riemann - roch theorem to the sheaves @xmath118 , @xmath119 and the projection @xmath120 ; this will give us important information about the chern classes of the family @xmath118 and about the chern classes of @xmath37 itself .",
    "the most important result is a parity theorem : the first chern class of @xmath37 is even modulo torsion , i.e. its image in @xmath121 belongs to the image of @xmath122 .",
    "this is a very restrictive condition ; it implies for instance that @xmath37 is minimal . on the other hand , using the results in @xcite , we see that @xmath37 can not be covered by curves , so @xmath123 .",
    "therefore , we are left with very few possibilities : a class vii surface with @xmath9 , a k3 surface , or a torus .",
    "the case when @xmath37 is a class vii surface requires a careful examination .",
    "this case will be treated in the fifth section , which contains the final arguments .",
    "the other two cases ( a k3 surface or a torus ) are khlerian , so they can be ruled out using the results in @xcite ; we will explain briefly the arguments used in @xcite for completeness .",
    "therefore we make use essentially of the theory of surfaces , so it is not clear yet how to generalize our arguments to larger @xmath6 . on the other hand , by the results in @xcite ,",
    "the regular part of any moduli space of stable bundles over a gauduchon compact manifold is a strong kt ( khler with torsion ) manifold .",
    "therefore , future progress in the classification of this class of manifolds will be very useful for extending our program to class vii surfaces with arbitrary @xmath6 .",

    "i am especially indebted to nicholas buchdahl for his careful and professional comments .",

    "similarly for the subscripts @xmath151 , @xmath152 .",

    "the geometry of this moduli space plays a fundamental role in our arguments .",
    "the idea to use this moduli space is surprising and might look artificial ; the point is that , whereas for a class vii surface with no curves the  classical \" complex geometric methods fail , a lot can be said about the corresponding moduli space @xmath153 , and the geometry of this space carries important information about the base surface .",
    "the characteristic number @xmath154 of a bundle @xmath3 with these invariants is @xmath29 and , by the riemann roch theorem , it follows that the expected complex dimension of the moduli space is also @xmath29 .",

    "_ we will endow this moduli space with the topology induced by this identification _ ( see section [ topprop ] for the main properties of this topology ) .",
    "one should _ not _ expect this moduli space to be a complex space : in the non - khlerian framework , moduli spaces of instantons have complicated singularities around the reductions , and these singularities are _ not _ of a complex geometric nature ( see @xcite and section [ topprop ] in this article )",

    "the filtrable bundles @xmath3 with @xmath33 , @xmath164 can be easily described as extensions .",

    "this follows easily from the genus formula ( see @xcite p. 85 ) taking into account that the intersection form of @xmath13 is negative definite .",
