    "for increasing complexity in ecosystems , modeling ecological consequences in continuously changing environmental conditions is one of the central concerns of theoretical ecologists .",
    "various key components like environmental heterogeneity , habitat fragmentation , habitat loss and seasonal pattern or climatic change profoundly impact many biological phenomena such as synchrony of oscillating populations , community structure , diversity - stability and synchrony - stability relationship @xcite .",
    "in particular , habitat connectivity through species dispersal among fragmented landscapes play significant role in determining ecosystem functioning and evolutionary processes @xcite .",
    "moreover , in spatial ecology , the connectivity of habitats conserves the ecological system by balancing the natural conditions @xcite .",
    "as population movement prevents local species loss from complete extinction in their local habitat , so it is important to understand the factors which influences the dispersal effect .",
    "numerous coupled nonlinear systems and coupled stochastic oscillators associated with dispersal conceptualize various biological notions starting from oscillations to chaotic behavior @xcite .",
    "particularly , in the context of species population dynamics , spatially extended dynamical systems with environmental heterogeneity play leading role in determining the community structure and in maintaining the biodiversity in regional landscapes @xcite .",
    "much less is still known about the effects of species dispersal in dynamic habitats of ecosystems .",
    "recently , in physical generic oscillators , dynamic environment has been considered in a scheme of indirect coupling to show various synchronization behavior @xcite as well as synchronization of chaotic systems @xcite , amplitude death and oscillation death @xcite .",
    "as far as ecological systems are concerned , in general , habitats are highly dynamic rather than static @xcite where species dispersal takes place in order to maintain the species diversity and persistence @xcite . in search of preferential food ,",
    "sometimes species move a long distance for suitable habitats @xcite .",
    "while moving from one habitat to another habitat , species get the available food from the environment for their survival .",
    "considering the varying environmental conditions as a dynamic variable , we model the consumer ",
    "resource interaction in a dynamic environment along with the presence of dispersion .",
    "we consider ecological oscillators represented by the rosenzweig ",
    "macarthur model under the simultaneous influence of two different types of couplings : one is the _ direct coupling _ describing the dispersal of species between spatially separated patches and another one is the _ indirect coupling _ describing a common dynamic environment for the patches which are connected via dispersal . as far as ecological environment",
    "is concerned , we consider the logistic growth model replicating a dynamic landscape . our main concern in this paper is to investigate how the interplay of these two separate types of coupling affects the collective dynamical behavior of an ecological system .    in general , the concepts of nonlinear dynamics have been widely used in many studies on complex ecological systems to characterize various natural processes and its ecological perspectives @xcite . emphasizing that , in coupled nonlinear systems , _ rhythmogenesis _ is an interesting dynamical phenomenon , such that the interaction through underlying coupling generates the oscillation from their respective steady states .",
    "generation of rhythms from steady state is a novel phenomenon in most of the coupled physical , chemical and biological systems @xcite .",
    "especially , for regulation and restoration of oscillatory behaviors in various physiological and neuronal systems , rhythmogenesis is utilized as an important consequence of coupled dynamical systems in which the underlying coupling acts as a feedback factor @xcite and drives the system away from steady state to oscillations .",
    "in contrast to the generation of oscillation from steady state , specific coupling involved in the system can drive coupled oscillators to oscillation quenching states , such as _ oscillation death _ ( od ) and _ amplitude death _ ( ad ) . in coupled oscillators , oscillation death ( od )",
    "is created by suppression of oscillations with formation of stable _ inhomogeneous steady states _ whereas ad is created by the suppression of oscillations with formation of stable _ homogeneous steady states _",
    "as far as ecological models are concerned , oscillation quenching mechanisms emphasize the relationship between dispersal induced stability and dispersal induced synchrony .",
    "using mean - field coupling as species dispersal in spatially extended ecological model , the relationship between synchrony and stability induced by dispersal has been shown in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this paper , through a rigorous bifurcation analysis we show that environmentally coupled ecological systems exhibit both generation and suppression of oscillations , which are two diametrically opposite phenomena . using this environmentally coupled model in homogeneous patches ( i.e. , identical patches ) ,",
    "we show amplitude death , oscillation death , formation of inhomogeneous limit cycles and transition of ad to od through a co - dimension-2 bifurcation .",
    "in particular , we emphasize that rhythmogenesis can occur along with different synchronized behavior .",
    "although , the uncoupled rm model has simple characteristics , but due to presence of environmental coupling and dispersal among the fragmented habitats , the system exhibits many interesting dynamics which can be useful in the context of ecological systems .",
    "moreover , we show that the dynamics of the considered system are qualitatively valid for a network of patches connected by a common environment and the system shows rhythmogenesis , perfect synchrony , in - phase synchrony , out - of - phase synchrony and the formation of multi - cluster state for a network of nearby connected patches .",
    "we organize the paper as : first , the environmentally coupled ecological model along with the dynamics of uncoupled system as well as the dynamics of environment are described in sec .",
    "[ s:2 ] . based on this model , the effect of dispersal and it s",
    "dynamics are shown in sec .",
    "[ s:3 ] in two different ways .",
    "one is based on the assumption that uncoupled patch is in oscillatory state and second one is started with steady state in uncoupled patch .",
    "further , we extend to a network of ring coupled oscillators and robustness of this model is shown in sec .",
    "finally , we discuss the results from dynamical systems point of view and also its ecological interpretation in sec .",
    "taking into account the dispersal between two spatially separated patches in a dynamic environment , we model the consumer ",
    "resource interaction in a single system emphasizing the dynamics of consumer interaction in three ways .",
    "first one is the consumer interaction within the patch , second is consumers interaction between the connected patches through dispersal , and finally , the consumer interaction through a common dynamic environment .",
    "we consider , dynamics of the consumer ( @xmath0 ) and the resource ( @xmath1 ) interaction within a patchy habitat is given by the rosenzweig ",
    "macarthur ( rm ) model @xcite .",
    "now , for the interaction between the isolated patches , we consider dispersal of consumer populations between spatially isolated patches .",
    "in fact , immigration and emigration are set by directly coupling the patches with dispersal rate ( @xmath2 ) . finally , while dispersing between patches , the consumer interacts with environment and gets the available resource from the environment for their survival during dispersal .",
    "this is potentially important for long distance dispersal of species . to describe the interaction through the environment , we consider another resource ( @xmath3 ) as a common dynamic environment and uncoupled dynamics of the environment is given by the logistic growth model",
    "further , the interaction between consumers ( @xmath4 ) and environment is governed by a type - ii functional response @xcite .",
    "the choice of this particular function is motivated by the fact that it represents a functional response for many consumers .",
    "the shape of the function is based on the idea that , at low resource densities , consumers spend most of their time on searching for resources , whereas at high resource densities , they spend most of their time on resource handling @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of consumer ( @xmath0 ) and resource ( @xmath1 ) for patch-1 and patch-2 along with the common environment ( @xmath3 ) are modeled as :    [ eq1 ] @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the growth rate of the resource ( @xmath1 ) with @xmath7 as its carrying capacity , @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the predation rate of the consumer ( @xmath0 ) and half saturation constant respectively . the predation efficiency and mortality rate of the consumer ( @xmath0 )",
    "are respectively given by @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the environmental resource ( @xmath3 ) acts as another resource consisting of logistic growth dynamics . in this case , the growth rate and the carrying capacity of the environment ( @xmath3 ) are given by @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "further , @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the predation rate and the predation efficiency of the consumer ( @xmath0 ) due to available resource from the common environment . in predatory level",
    ", @xmath16 is half saturation constant of the environment ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "the equations ( [ eq1]a)-([eq1]c ) emphasize that we use _ direct coupling _ between the consumers from neighboring patches via the dispersal rate @xmath2 and _ indirect coupling _ through the predation rate @xmath14 of the consumer ( @xmath0 ) .    in all the previous studies",
    "@xcite the environment has been considered as an overdamped oscillator having no intrinsic dynamics other than zero steady state : the environment is modulated in a linear way in the presence of systems that are coupled with it .",
    "this is an oversimplified view of any environment and thus , the true essence of ( nonlinear ) dynamical environment was missing in those studies . as the environment plays a key role in determining the dynamics of the coupled system , therefore , it is of fundamental interest to study the effect of an environment that is represented with some _ realistic _ model . here ,",
    "not only we take a realistic environment ( logistic growth model ) but , apart from that , unlike the previous studies @xcite we also consider the interaction among the environment and systems to be nonlinear .",
    "interestingly , it can be shown that the model of environment considered in @xcite viz .",
    "@xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the damping parameter , is a special case of the general model given in eq .",
    "( [ eq1]c ) . when @xmath19 , from eq .",
    "( [ eq1]c ) the per capita rate of change of environment is @xmath20 and hence declines by the quantity @xmath21 for each individual added in the population .",
    "let us consider that we perturb @xmath22 by a small quantity @xmath23 , so the perturbed density is @xmath24 .",
    "now @xmath25 as @xmath26 . expanding the function @xmath27 about @xmath22 and neglecting the higher order terms we get @xmath28 .",
    "as @xmath29 and @xmath30 , so the approximate form of @xmath31 a small distance away from the equilibrium point @xmath32 is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "hence , if the steady state of the environment is perturbed by a small amount by some external factors it will actually behave like an overdamped oscillator .",
    "thus , the environment we have considered here resembles the overdamped model for a smaller perturbation , but additionally , it also accommodates the effect of larger perturbation exerted by the systems .",
    "therefore , the environment considered here , indeed , represents a general model of environment . in",
    "the following we will emphasize on the results that come due to this nonlinear environment , and which were not observed for the previously considered simplified overdamped model of environment .",
    "the uncoupled dynamics of the rm model ( i.e. , eqs .",
    "( [ eq1]a)-([eq1]b ) with @xmath35 and @xmath19 ) are discussed in @xcite . here",
    "we briefly discuss it for the sake of clarity .",
    "the rm model has two trivial equilibrium points ( i.e. , @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) and one non - trivial equilibrium point ( i.e. , @xmath38 ) .",
    "this non - trivial equilibrium point is stable if @xmath39 for certain parameter values of @xmath7 .",
    "however , for a range of @xmath7 value , the non - trivial equilibrium point changes it s stability and raises to stable limit cycle .",
    "hence , the rm model is in either steady state or in oscillation state depending upon different parametric values .",
    "now , let us investigate the stability of the coupled system given by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "the trivial equilibrium points of the environmentally coupled system ( [ eq1 ] ) are given by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and a non - trivial equilibrium point is given by ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "as the expression of the non - trivial equilibrium point is quite cumbersome , here we do nt give the expression .",
    "however , the expressions for @xmath49 and @xmath50 are given by : @xmath51    the jacobian matrix ( @xmath52 ) at the non - trivial equilibrium point @xmath53 is given by : @xmath54 where @xmath55 in the jacobian @xmath52 , we have block matrices which simplifies the method of finding eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvalues are given by the expression : @xmath56 and @xmath57 can be found out by the roots of the polynomial @xmath58 , where @xmath59 from these eigenvalues , stability of the equilibrium point for different parameter values can be found . however , it has to be noted that due to the nonlinear nature of the coefficients of jacobian , in most of the cases it is very difficult to predict the exact bifurcation points using eigenvalue analysis .",
    "thus , to locate the bifurcation points and curves , we resort to the continuation package @xmath60 @xcite . the collective behavior of the coupled systems for different coupling and system parameters are described in the next section .",
    "emphasizing that , without coupling the rm model has either steady state or oscillatory state depending on the values of parameters , we qualitatively describe the coupled dynamics of system ( [ eq1 ] ) in two distinct conditions : first , we consider the uncoupled patches are in oscillatory condition and examine how coupling affects the oscillation suppression states .",
    "whereas , in the second case we consider the uncoupled patches are in equilibrium condition and investigate how coupling changes this quiescent state in order to establish any possible rhythmogenesis . in the numerical bifurcation analysis @xcite we use the fourth - order runge - kutta algorithm with step size 0.001 .",
    "we start with the precondition that in the absence of dispersal ( i.e. , @xmath35 ) between the patch-1 and patch-2 and also the in the absence of coupling with environment ( i.e. , @xmath19 ) , the resource ( @xmath1 ) and the consumer ( @xmath0 ) show oscillations .",
    "then , we study the simultaneous effects of dispersal and environmental coupling .      for lower dispersion rate determined by the parameter @xmath2",
    ", we observe that with increasing predation rate @xmath14 , ad appears from stable limit cycle through an inverse supercritical hopf bifurcation ( hb3 ) .",
    "figures  [ f : syn](a ) and [ f : syn](b ) show the ad state beyond @xmath61 for the resource ( @xmath62 ) and the consumer ( @xmath4 ) , respectively for @xmath63 . here in both patch-1 and patch-2 ,",
    "populations are suppressed to homogeneous steady states .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that an environment modeled by an overdamped oscillator along with the linear modulation from the system can induce ad in the presence of dispersion in generic oscillators .",
    "but , the region of ad in the @xmath64 space was shown to be very narrow .",
    "in contrast to that , in our present case once ad occurs at @xmath65 the system stuck to that state even for higher values of @xmath14 .",
    "this contrast in results may be attributed to the fact that , unlike ref .",

    "is resulted , which is discussed below .     with varying dispersal rate @xmath2 .",

    "also , od2 is created from od1 through a transcritical bifurcation ( tb ) at @xmath69 .",
    "it is noteworthy that , od1 and od2 are accompanied by a stable limit cycle , but od3 that is created through supercritical hopf bifurcation ( hb3 ) for a higher dispersal value does not share the phase space with any oscillatory state .",
    "moreover , for @xmath70 , the dynamics of the environmental resource ( @xmath3 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : syn](e ) .",
    "although , uncoupled dynamic environment ( @xmath3 ) is in steady state , it shows the synchronized oscillating behavior when its coupled with the oscillating patches .    in fig .",
    "[ f : syn](c ) , od1 shows inhomogeneous steady states where @xmath71 and @xmath3 have non - zero density .",
    "but , in the od2 state , the density of the resource ( @xmath72 ) in one patch is almost zero and another is non - zero .",
    "surprisingly , in this situation , the consumers ( @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) from both patches have non - zero density both in od1 and od2 states . even though the resource ( @xmath72 ) in one patch of od2 is almost zero , but the consumer ( @xmath75 ) from that patch survives because of the available resource in the environment .",
    "indeed , in the absence of resource ( @xmath72 ) , the survival of consumer ( @xmath75 ) is completely supported by the environmental resource ( @xmath3 ) only .    the importance of direct coupling and environmental coupling and it s dynamics are shown for broader range of parameters using two parameter bifurcation diagram in @xmath76 space .",

    "[ f : syn](f ) is the transition from homogeneous limit cycle ( hlc ) to inhomogeneous limit cycles ( ihlc ) with the variation of dispersal rate @xmath2 for a certain range of @xmath14 . the genesis of this transition can be understood more clearly from the one dimensional bifurcation diagram with @xmath2 for an exemplary value @xmath66 . from fig .",

    "[ f : eg](b ) ) .",
    "we extend the system ( [ eq1 ] ) to a network consisting @xmath121 number of patches coupled by a common dynamic environment ( @xmath3 ) and also dispersal takes place among the connected patches . using a ring type coupled network ( i.e. , we consider the periodic boundary condition ) , we set that each patch is connected to its nearest neighbor .",
    "so the dynamics of the consumer ( @xmath0 ) and the resource ( @xmath1 ) in the @xmath122 patch along with common dynamic environment ( @xmath3 ) are given by :    [ eq2 ] @xmath123    since many patches are connected in network with a common environment , we consider a high carrying capacity ( @xmath13 ) of the environment so that it can support many connected patches .",
    "we check the robustness of our results at different levels of dispersal rate for a network consisting 16 patches and a common dynamic environment .",
    "first for low values of @xmath14 , fig .",
    "[ f : ns](a ) shows the synchronized oscillations of 16 patches when dispersal rate @xmath124 .",
    "time series of perfectly synchronized homogeneous limit cycles ( hlc ) of the consumer ( @xmath0 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ns](f ) .    with an increase in @xmath14 and choosing appropriate initial conditions , fig .",
    "[ f : ns](b ) shows inhomogeneous limit cycles for the same dispersal rate @xmath124 .",
    "corresponding trajectories are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ns](g ) . from this , it is clear that consumer species in 16 patches are in - phase synchronized . as like two patches , network of 16 patches",
    "also show ad and od . depending on initial conditions , we get either ihlc or oscillation death .",
    "spatiotemporal dynamics and time series of multi - clustered od states are shown in figs .",
    "[ f : ns](c ) and [ f : ns](h ) , respectively .    for low dispersal rate ( @xmath125 ) , ad occurs . the suppression of oscillation in homogeneous steady states is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ns](d ) with the time series shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ns](i ) .",
    "occurrence of rhythmogeneis is shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ns](e ) and [ f : ns](j ) for @xmath100 , @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "the environmentally coupled system of a network shows similar kind of dynamics shown for 2 patches . from the collective behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ f : ns ] , it is clear that hlc , ihlc , ad , od and rhythmogeneis all are also valid in a network connected by common dynamic environment .",
    "in summary , in this paper we have modeled an ecological system connecting local habitats through dispersal in a common environment in which the considered environment is nonlinear and dynamic ; at the same time we also consider the interaction between the patches and the common dynamic environment is essentially nonlinear , which is controlled by ecologically relevant parameters like conversion efficiency and half saturation constant .",
    "we highlight that the consumer interactions in three distinct ways such as the interaction within the patch , between the patch and through the environment , however all are interrelated in the collective behavior once coupling involves in the system .",
    "specifically , our study reveals the role of environmental coupling and the effects of inter - patch dispersal on a spatially extended rosenzweig ",
    "macarthur model using various bifurcation techniques .",
    "with simple diffusive coupling in species dispersal , the coupled system exhibits many interesting dynamics with variability in spatial and environmental parameters . starting from generation of oscillations , various synchronization processes in a smooth oscillator and its suppression to different steady states such as ad , od and ad - od transition",
    "are shown in an ecological system . from different steady states and",
    "oscillation , the relationship between synchrony and stability induced by dispersal as well as induced by the dynamic environment has been identified . even though resource density is not directly involved in dispersal , the intrinsic dynamics and the consumer - resource interaction within the patch enables same qualitative behavior in all the species involved in system .",
    "further , the environmental correlation due to species dispersal enables the persistence of the ecosystem via stabilization of oscillating populations .",
    "earlier , landscape and metapopulation models have been used to predict the species extinction risk and spatial pattern on ecological processes @xcite .",
    "although our model depicts as metapopulation model , but explicitly describes various ecological perspectives qualitatively and quantitatively .",
    "in particular , dispersal enhances the occurrences of synchronized oscillations and synchrony - stability relationship . in biological system functioning ,",
    "synchronization of rhythms plays important role @xcite .",
    "rhythmogenesis is an emergent behavior of dynamical system since restoration of oscillations can be achieved easily even if the system is in a steady state .",
    "also , due to the presence of noise in ecological systems , oscillating species are prone to extinction easily , so it is better to understand the factors which enhance the synchrony  stability relationship .",
    "although many internal and external factors influence in dispersal for successful colonization in the new habitat , but different environmental conditions due to heterogeneity enable the appearance and disappearance of oscillations and transition of homogeneous steady states to inhomogeneous steady states in this system .",
    "in general , spatial and environmental heterogeneity clearly distinguish the synchrony  stability relationship induced by both dispersal and a common dynamic environment .",
    "further , in the context of food web dynamics , food web complexity and species movement pattern contribute largely to enrich the current knowledge @xcite .",
    "generally , active as well as passive dispersal take place in natural systems .",
    "specifically , in active dispersal , species are directly involved in movement whereas in passive dispersal , species are being moved by other factors . in this work",
    ", we set active dispersal in consumer populations only , but in addition , dispersal also happens in resource populations either directly or indirectly @xcite .",
    "further , time scale of dispersal is slow as compare to temporal dynamics within the patch and interconnected habitats are heterogeneous with various network structure .",
    "thus , further study is required to focus on different kind of dispersal with different time scales in heterogeneous environments .",
