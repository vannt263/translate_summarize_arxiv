    "there are many exciting interfaces between physics at hera and the lhc , and i can not do justice to all of them in this talk . therefore ,",
    "in this talk i focus on a few specific subjects that interest me personally , starting with the lhc s ` core business ' , namely the search for new physics at the tev scale , notably the higgs boson(s ) and supersymmetry  @xcite . identifying any signals for such new physics will require understanding of the standard model backgrounds , and qcd in particular .",
    "i then continue by discussing some other topics of specific interest to the desy community .",
    "@xmath2 the understanding of qcd will be important for making accurate studies of any such new physics .",
    "perturbative qcd at moderate @xmath0 and large @xmath3 is quite well understood , with dramatic further progress now being promised by novel calculational techniques based on string theory  @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 novel experimental phenomena are now emerging at rhic at small @xmath0 , following harbingers at hera .",
    "the parton density saturates , and a powerful organizational framework is provided by the colour - glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite .",
    "forward measurements at the lhc will provide unique opportunities for following up on this hera / rhic physics .",
    "@xmath2 forward physics at the lhc will also provide valuable insight into the interpretation of ultra - high - energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs )  @xcite .",
    "one of the principal uncertainties in determining their energy scale is the modeling of the hadronic showers they induce , and the lhc will be the closest laboratory approximation to uhecr energies .",
    "@xmath2 looking further forward , there is increasing interest in exploring at the lhc the new vistas in hard and soft diffraction opened up by the discovery of rapidity - gap events at hera  @xcite .",
    "one particularly interesting possibility is quasi - exclusive diffractive production of higgs bosons or other new particles at the lhc  @xcite .",
    "this is particularly interesting in supersymmetric extensions of the standard model , notably those in which cp is violated  @xcite .",
    "many studies have given confidence that the standard model higgs boson will be found at the lhc , if it exists  @xcite .",
    "moreover , there are some chances that it might be found quite quickly , in particular if its mass is between about 160  gev and 600  gev . however , discovering the higgs boson will take rather longer if its mass is below about 130  gev , as suggested in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm )  @xcite . in this case , the higgs signal would be composed of contributions from several different production and decay channels , notably including @xmath4 .    understanding the gluon distribution at @xmath5 is therefore a high priority , and one",
    "to which hera measurements of processes involving gluons have been playing key roles  @xcite .",
    "perturbative corrections to the @xmath6 production process need to be understood theoretically , as do the corrections to @xmath7 decay .",
    "resummation of the next - to - next - to - leading logarithms has by now reduced these uncertainties to the 10% level , and further improvements may be possible with the string - inspired calculational techniques now being introduced  @xcite .",
    "[ fig : accuracy ] shows estimates of the accuracy with which various higgs couplings may be determined at the lhc , also if the luminosity may be increased by an order of magnitude ( slhc )  @xcite [ see also  @xcite ] .",
    "there are interesting prospects for measuring the couplings to @xmath8 and @xmath9 as well as the total higgs decay width , though not with great accuracy .",
    "measurements at the ilc would clearly be much more powerful for this purpose  @xcite .",
    "the prospect of imminent higgs discovery is leading theorists to place their last bets on the lhc roulette wheel , and many are hedging their bets by proposing and discussing alternatives to the standard model or the mssm .",
    "composite higgs models are not greatly favoured , since they have a strong tendency to conflict with the precision electroweak data  @xcite .",
    "this problem has led some theorists to question the interpretation of the electroweak data , which are normally taken to favour @xmath10  gev , debating their consistency and even arguing that some data should perhaps be discounted  @xcite .",
    "personally , i see no strong reason to doubt the hints from the electroweak data .",
    "an alternative corridor leading towards higher higgs masses is provided by including higher - dimensional operators in the electroweak data analysis  @xcite : this would require some fine - tuning , but can not be excluded . an even more extreme alternative that has been re - explored",
    "recently is that of higgsless models  @xcite .",
    "however , these lead to strong @xmath11 scattering and conflict with the available electroweak data .",
    "these problems are alleviated , but not solved , by postulating extra dimensions at the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "one of the least unappetizing alternatives to the supersymmetric higgs paradigm is offered by little higgs models  @xcite .",
    "their key idea is to embed the standard model in a larger gauge group , from which the higgs boson emerges as a relatively light pseudo - goldstone boson .",
    "the one - loop quadratic divergence due to the top quark :    @xmath12 is cancelled by the contribution of a new heavy @xmath13 quark :    @xmath14 additionally , there are new gauge bosons and exotic higgs representations .",
    "the standard - model - like higgs boson is expected to be relatively light , possibly below @xmath15  gev , whereas the other new particles are expected to be heavier :    @xmath16 certainly the new @xmath13 quark , probably the @xmath17 boson and possibly even the doubly - charged higgs boson will be accessible to the lhc .",
    "thus little higgs models have quite rich phenomenology , as well being decently motivated .",
    "however , they are not as complete as supersymmetry , and would require more new physics at energies @xmath18  tev .",
    "depending on the mass scale of this new physics , there may be some possibility for distinguishing a little higgs model from the standard model by measurements of the @xmath4 process at the lhc .",
    "however , the ilc would clearly have better prospects in this regard  @xcite .",
    "no apologies for repeating the supersymmetric mantra : it resolves the naturalness aspect of the hierarchy problem by cancelling systematically the quadratic divergences in all loop corrections to the higgs mass and hence stabilizes the electroweak scale  @xcite , it enables the gauge couplings to unify  @xcite , it predicts @xmath19  gev  @xcite as suggested by the precision electroweak data  @xcite , it stabilizes the higgs potential for low higgs masses  @xcite , and it provides a plausible candidate  @xcite for the dark matter that astrophysicists and cosmologists claim clutters up the universe .    however , all we have from accelerators at the moment are lower limits on the possible supersymmetric particle masses , most notably from the absence of sparticles at lep : @xmath20  gev and the tevatron collider : @xmath21  gev , the lep lower limit @xmath22  gev , and the consistency of @xmath23 decay with the standard model .",
    "however , if we assume that the astrophysical cold dark matter is largely composed of the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , and require its density to lie within the range allowed by wmap et al  @xcite :    @xmath24 we obtain upper as well as lower limits on the possible sparticle masses .",
    "the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , @xmath25 , provides intermittent hints on the supersymmetric mass scale  @xcite : these are lower limits if you do not believe there is any significant discrepancy with the standard model prediction , but also an upper limit if you do not believe that the standard model can fit the data , as is indicated by the current interpretation of the @xmath26 data used to calculate the standard model prediction .",

    "we do not know what the lhc will find - maybe there will be no supersymmetry and we will observe mini - black - hole production instead ! however , whatever the physics scenario , hera physics will provide crucial inputs , for example via measuring the parton distributions that will be crucial for searches for new physics such as the higgs boson , or via the observation of saturation effects that will be important for forward physics , or via measurements of diffraction .",
    "forward physics is a potentially exciting area of lhc physics that is not covered by the present detectors .",
