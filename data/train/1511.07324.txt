    "the replica method for studying directed polymers , pioneered by kardar in 1987 @xcite , has received a great deal of attention recently ( cf . @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we present a version of this method which ultimately leads to both the gue and gse tracy - widom distributions ( for full - space and half - space polymers , respectively ) .",
    "our aim is primarily pedagogical .",
    "we strive for mathematical clarity and do away with certain assumptions used in previous works ( such as completeness of the bethe ansatz and the evaluation of eigenfunction norms ) .    in this introduction",
    "we briefly highlight the central feature of our version of the polymer replica method  the use of nested contour integrals and their residue expansions ( rather than direct application of the bethe ansatz )  and briefly explain its connection to earlier work .",
    "the final result of our computations provides formulas characterizing the distributions of the partition function of full - space and half - space continuum directed random polymers .",
    "we have attempted to provide computations which are as mathematically sound as possible ( without getting into too many technicalities ) .",
    "thus , up to a few technical assumptions on uniqueness of solutions to the delta bose gas , our computations of the polymer partition function moments are mathematically rigorous . in the course of this computation",
    "all stated lemmas and propositions are accompanied by proofs .",
    "unfortunately , the moments of the partition function _ do not _ uniquely characterize the one - point distribution .",
    "therefore , our final step of recovering the partition function s laplace transform from the ( divergent ) moment generating function is , at its heart , unjustifiable . in fact , this issue plagues all of the aforementioned replica method works .",
    "we proceed nevertheless and by an illegal application of a mellin - barnes summation trick we convert this divergent generating function into a convergent series of integrals . in the case of the full - space polymer",
    "this series can be matched to the formula derived independently and in parallel in @xcite and proved in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a second proof ) . in the half - space polymer",
    "there are no corresponding rigorous results yet with which to compare the answer .",
    "the replica method work of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) also deals with the half - space polymer in the limit as our parameter @xmath4 characterizing the interaction of the polymer with the wall goes to infinity ( the wall becomes absorbing ) . we do not take this limit and hence do not compare our results to those derived in @xcite . however , let us remark that in @xcite , the authors recover the predicted gse tracy - widom distribution .",
    "we believe that the most convincing argument for why this unjustified procedure produces the correct answer is that it is a shadow of a totally parallel procedure which can be performed rigorously on a suitable @xmath5-deformed regularization of our present model .",
    "for the full - space case this has been done in @xcite .",
    "taking a suitable @xmath6 limit of the final formulas from these works provides a rigorous derivation of the laplace transform formula we non - rigorously derive herein .",
    "a parallel treatment of the half - space case has not yet been performed ( see section [ mathrig ] for more on rigorous mathematical work related to this paper ) .",
    "the polymer replica method relies upon the fact that the joint moments ( at a fixed time @xmath7 and different spatial locations @xmath8 ) of the partition function for the directed polymer ( introduced in section [ modelssec ] ) satisfy certain closed systems of evolution equations ( see section [ mappingsec ] ) .",
    "these systems go by the name of the delta bose gas or the lieb - liniger model with two - body delta interaction ( we will use both names interchangeably ) , and variants of them hold in relation to both the full - space and half - space polymers .",
    "they are known to be integrable , which means that solving them can be reduced to solving a system of @xmath9 free one - body evolution equations subject to @xmath10 two - body boundary conditions ( see definitions [ akmbs ] and [ bkmbs ] for these systems ) .",
    "the typical approach employed to solve the free evolution equation with @xmath10 two - body boundary conditions is to try to diagonalize the system ( for instance , via the bethe ansatz ) .",
    "the bethe ansatz produces eigenfunctions , but does not a priori provide the knowledge of the relevant subspace of eigenfunctions on which to decompose the initial data as well as the knowledge of the norms of the eigenfunctions . though we remark more on this approach below in section [ relationbasec ] , it is not the route we follow . instead , for delta function initial data we directly solve the system via a single @xmath9-fold nested contour integral ( see lemmas [ solnlemma2 ] and [ solnlemma ] in section [ solnsec ] ) .",
    "this solution is easily checked to satisfy the desired system by simple residue calculus .",
    "the type of result one hopes to get from the spectral approach is recovered by deforming the nested contours in these formulas to all coincide with the same contour @xmath11 .",
    "the eigenfunctions , their norms and the relevant subspace all come immediately out of the residue expansion coming from the poles crossed during these contour deformations ( see section [ relationbasec ] for more on this ) . in section [ modelssec ]",
    "we introduce the full - space continuum directed random polymer partition function @xmath12 as well as the half - space analog @xmath13 where @xmath4 determines an energetic cost / rewards for the polymer paths reflected at the origin ( @xmath14 corresponds to an energetic cost or repulsive interaction and @xmath15 corresponds to an energetic reward or attractive interaction ) .",
    "we define the joint moments for these partition functions as @xmath16 ,    \\qquad\\qquad \\bar{z}^a(t;\\vec{x } ) : = { \\ensuremath{\\mathbb{e}}}\\big[z^a(t , x_1)\\cdots z^a(t , x_k)\\big]\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is assumed to be ordered as @xmath18 for the full - space case and as @xmath19 for the half - space case .",
    "we record equations ( [ aknci ] ) and ( [ bknci ] ) which are nested contour integral formulas for these joint moments .",
    "in the full - space case we show that @xmath20 where we assume that @xmath21 . and",
    "in the half - space case we show that @xmath22 where we assume that @xmath21 and @xmath23 for @xmath24 arbitrary .",
    "we call the above expressions nested contour integrals since the contours respect a certain infinite version of nesting ( so as to avoid poles coming from the denominator ) . in the full - space case",
    "this formula seems to have first appeared in 1985 work of yudson @xcite . as solutions of the delta bose gas ( or yang s system ) with general type root systems ( the above formulas correspond with type @xmath25 and type @xmath26 root systems , respectively ) such formulas appeared in 1997 work of heckman - opdam @xcite .    using cauchy s theorem and the residue theorem we may deform the contours in both expressions until they all coincide with @xmath11 . in the course of these deformations we encounter first - order poles coming from the terms @xmath27 ( and in the half - space case , also @xmath28 and @xmath29 participate ) in the denominator .",
    "it is this expansion into residue subspaces which replaces the spectral decomposition ( see section [ relationbasec ] ) . for the half - space case , when @xmath30 the faction @xmath31 which considerably simplifies the analysis versus @xmath32 .",
    "we do not presently attempt to work out the @xmath32 residue expansion ( see remark [ nota ] ) .    in order to develop the expansion of our nested contour formulas ( in both the full - space and half - space cases , as well as in various @xmath5-deformed cases  cf .",
    "proposition [ 321 ] ) there are three parallel steps :    * step 1 : * we identify the residual subspaces which arise in such an expansion . in terms of a meta - formula ( letting nci represent the words `` nested contour integral '' ) : @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents taking the residue along the residual subspace indexed by @xmath35 , and where the integrals on the right - hand side are over the variables which remain after computing the residues . as an example , consider ( [ aknciintro ] ) for @xmath36 . then",
    "if we choose @xmath37 from the start , we must deform the @xmath38 contour to @xmath11 .",
    "regarding @xmath39 as fixed along @xmath11 , as we deform the @xmath38 contour we necessarily encounter a pole at @xmath40 and thus the nested contour integral is expanded into two terms  one in which the integrals of @xmath38 and @xmath39 are both along @xmath11 and the second in which only the @xmath39 integral remains and the integrand is replaced by the residue at @xmath40 .    in general ,",
    "due to the vandermonde term in the numerator of the integrands we consider , the residual subspaces we encounter are indexed by certain strings of residues , as well as partitions @xmath41 which identify the sizes of the strings .",
    "* step 2 : * we show that via the action of the symmetric group ( in the full - space case ) or the hyperoctahedral group ( in the half - space case ) we can transform our residual subspaces into a canonical form , only indexed by a partition @xmath41 .",
    "moreover , even though only certain elements of these groups arise from such transformations , we readily check that all other group elements lead to zero residue contribution .",
    "thus , we can rewrite our sum over residual subspaces as a sum over @xmath41 and the symmetric or hyperoctahedral group .",
    "using @xmath42 to denote either of these groups , we arrive at our second meta - formula ( we have suppressed certain constants arising from group symmetries ) @xmath43 now @xmath44 represents taking the residue along the canonical form residual subspace corresponding with @xmath45 .",
    "* step 3 : * due to the form of the integrand we may rewrite it as a @xmath42-invariant function , times a remainder function which does not contain any of the poles presently relevant .",
    "this allows us to reach our final meta - formula : @xmath46 here @xmath47 represents substitution or restriction of a function to the canonical form residual subspace corresponding with @xmath45 . in the cases we deal with in this paper",
    ", the residue term above can be explicitly evaluated , and the substitution term is generally left as is , though simplified considerably in certain cases ( such as when the locations @xmath48 ) .    in the full - space case ,",
    "proposition [ akcprop ] and its proof substantiate the above outlined steps .",
    "this type of residue expansion for the delta - bose gas goes back at least to @xcite , and this particular proposition is already present in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.2.1 ) and ( * ? ? ? * lemma 7.3 ) . in the half - space case ,",
    "we provide conjecture [ bkcprop ] which explains what we believe to be the manner through which this expansion works .",
    "we additionally provide some evidence for the conjecture in section [ sec : one - string ] .",
    "this conjecture involves some rather subtle cancelations of residues which at first appear to complicate the situation .",
    "the bethe ansatz goes back to bethe s 1931 solution ( i.e. diagonalization ) of the spin @xmath49 heisenberg xxx spin chain @xcite .",
    "lieb - liniger diagaonlized their eponymous model ( in the repulsive case ) in 1963 utilizing this eigenfunction ansatz @xcite ( it appears that this was the first application of the ansatz after bethe s original work and the approach was essentially rediscovered by lieb - liniger ) .",
    "soon after , mcguire formulated the string hypotheses for the attractive case of the lieb - liniger model @xcite . a great deal of work on this model ( and its half - space variant ) ensued , most notably in @xcite ( see @xcite for a review of this early work ) .",
    "the ( nested ) contour integrals for solutions of the lieb - liniger model with arbitrary initial conditions play a prominent role in @xcite .",
    "their form can be traced back to the classical works of harish - chandra in the 1950 s on harmonic analysis on riemannian symmetric spaces ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in @xcite they are used to prove the completeness of the bethe ansatz eigenfunctions .",
    "the space of functions in which they work does not contain the @xmath50 initial condition with which this paper is concerned .",
    "however , their type of contour shifting arguments can be extended to this case well , and this extension is central for the present paper . in @xcite ,",
    "@xmath5-deformed versions of the nested contour integrals are utilized to prove plancherel theories for more general classes of eigenfunctions ( related to the @xmath5-boson and higher - spin six vertex models ) .",
    "the connection to the bethe ansatz can also be seen in the formulas above : the @xmath47 part of ( [ astar ] ) ( denoted @xmath51 later in the text ) turns out to be an eigenfunction of the rewritten lieb - liniger model hamiltonian ( see definitions [ akmbs ] and [ bkmbs ] ) , while the @xmath44 term incorporates the inverse squared norm of the eigenfunction and its pairing with the initial condition .",
    "our choice of the @xmath50 initial condition yields simple expressions that eventually allow us to access the asymptotics we need .    in earlier work on macdonald processes @xcite ,",
    "@xmath52-deformed versions of these nested contour integrals arose and independently led to the formulas above ( in the full - space case ) .",
    "in @xcite these formulas encoded the application of the macdonald ( first ) difference operators to multiplicative functions .",
    "the reasons why iterating macdonald difference operators is related to the same nested integrals as arise in @xcite are still unclear to us ( see however some exploration into this in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 6.1 ) .",
    "even though the replica method for the continuum directed polymer falls short on mathematical rigor , it can be put on a solid mathematical ground by appealing to certain discretizations which preserve the model s bethe ansatz solvability .",
    "let us work for the moment just with full - space systems .",
    "presently , the most general class of such discretizations are known of as the _ higher - spin vertex models _ ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "these stochastic interacting particle systems are solved in @xcite by an analog of the replica method known of as _ markov dualities _ ( see @xcite for a different approach than duality to study these systems ) .",
    "there are many degenerations of these higher - spin vertex models and the duality / replica method applies to all of them .",
    "these degenerations include interacting particle systems ( such as the stochastic six vertex model @xcite , asep @xcite , brownian motions with skew reflection @xcite , @xmath5-hahn tasep @xcite , discrete time @xmath5-tasep @xcite , @xmath5-tasep @xcite , @xmath5-pushasep @xcite ) and directed polymer models ( such as the beta polymer @xcite , inverse beta polymer @xcite , log - gamma polymer @xcite , strict - weak polymer @xcite , semi - discrete brownian polymer @xcite ) . in some cases the moments",
    "do determine the distribution and the duality / replica method can be rigorously performed , while other cases suffer a similar fate in that higher moments growth too fast , or even become infinite . however , once the distribution ( or laplace transform ) is computed rigorously , if the model converges to the continuum polymer ( as shown in various cases @xcite ) then taking a limit of the distribution function or laplace transform provides a rigorous derivation of the continuum formula .    the approach taken in @xcite by tracy and widom in studying asep",
    "involves using bethe ansatz to directly study transition probabilities and eventually extra marginal distributions from these formulas .",
    "while this approach bares some similarity to the duality / replica method , it does not have a clear degeneration to , for instance , the level of the continuum directed polymer .",
    "this work did , however , provide the first means to rigorously study the continuum directed polymer @xcite .",
    "besides the duality / replica method and tracy and widom s approach , the macdonald process @xcite approach has also proved quite fruitful in providing rigorous results on exact formulas for directed polymer models  for further references , see the review @xcite and reference therein .",
    "there exist other probabilistic methods which provide scaling exponents ( though not exact distributions ) for directed polymer models ",
    "see for example , @xcite in the context of the log - gamma polymer .    for half - space systems ,",
    "much less has been done .",
    "notably , for asep with finitely many particles , transition probabilities have been computed @xcite , but no one - point marginal distribution formulas have been extracted .",
    "for the half - space log - gamma polymer , an analysis ( analogous to the full - space case results of @xcite ) has been undertaken in @xcite .",
    "a laplace transform formula is conjectured therein , though does not seem to be readily accessible to any asymptotics . for zero - temperature polymers ( i.e. last passage percolation )",
    "there are considerably more results as explained in section [ lpp ] .",
    "we write @xmath53 and @xmath54 . when we perform integrals along vertical complex contours ( such as @xmath11 )",
    "we will always assume that the contour is slightly to the right of the specified real part ( i.e. @xmath55 ) so as to avoid any poles on said contour .",

    "@xmath9 , which is written @xmath41 .",
    "an alternative notation for @xmath45 is @xmath62 where @xmath63 represents the multiplicity of @xmath64 in the partition @xmath45 .",

    "chapter 10 of @xcite ) as @xmath65 and the pochhammer symbol ( or rising factorial as the falling factorial . ] ) as @xmath66 .      in section [ modres ]",
    "we introduce our polymer models ( along with some background ) and state our main results . in section [ mappingsec ]",
    "we explain how the problem of computing the joint moments of the polymer partition function is mapped to a many body system . in section [ solnsec ]",
    "we solve that many body system via nested contour integral formulas . in section [ expsec ]",
    "we show how these formulas expand into residues when the nested contours are taken together to @xmath11 ( this is a conjecture in the half - space case ) . in section [ mgfsec ]",
    "we use the expansion of the moment formulas from earlier to compute the laplace transform of the full - space and half - space polymer partition functions .",
    "we also perform long - time asymptotics and in the half - space case explain how we recognize the gse tracy - widom distribution .",
    "finally , in section [ proofsec ] we provide proofs of the residue expansion formulas , with the half - space conjecture being proved modulo claim [ claim : res - are - zero ] . in section [ partsec ]",
    "we provide notions concerning partitions and in section [ asymsec ] , we provide background converning the symmetric and hyperoctahedral groups .",
    "evidence for claim [ claim : res - are - zero ] is subsequently provided in section [ sec : one - string ] .",

    "models of directed polymers in disordered media in @xmath0 dimensions provide a unified framework for studying a variety of physical and mathematical systems as well as serve as a paradigm in the general study of disordered systems .",
    "physically they provide models of domain walls of ising type models with impurities @xcite , vortices in superconductors @xcite , roughness of crack interfaces @xcite , burgers turbulence @xcite , and interfaces in competing bacterial colonies @xcite ( see also the reviews @xcite or @xcite for more applications ) .",
    "mathematically , they are closely related to stochastic ( partial ) differential equations @xcite , stochastic optimization problems ( including important problems in bio - statistics @xcite and operations research @xcite ) , branching markov processes in random environments @xcite , as well as certain aspects of integrable systems and combinatorics ( which will be discussed below ) . the free energy of the polymer partition function is related to the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) equation @xcite whose spatial derivative is the stochastic burgers equation @xcite .",
    "these are representatives of a large universality class of growth models and interacting particle systems ( see the review @xcite ) .    the physical motivation of the present work is to study the probability distribution of the free energy ( logarithm of the partition function ) of the continuum directed polymer in the full - space , as well as in the presence of a hard reflecting / absorbing wall .",
    "we compute the laplace transform ( hence also the probability distribution ) of the partition function in both geometries ( though for the half - space case we only work with @xmath30 ) . taking a large time limit",
    "we show that in both geometries the free energy fluctuations scale with exponent @xmath3 , though they display different limiting probability distributions  the gue ( written @xmath67 or @xmath68 ) versus gse ( written @xmath69 or @xmath70 ) tracy - widom distributions . in the context of last passage percolation with full and half - space geometries , these scalings and distributions first arose in the work of johansson @xcite and baik - rains @xcite .",
