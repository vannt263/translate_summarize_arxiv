    "one of the key issues in quantizations of fundamental theories , which due to their covariance properties are systems with gauge freedom generated by constraints , is the determination of physical observables .",
    "they must satisfy the constraint equations and be invariant under gauge transformations .",
    "for canonical quantum theories , solving constraints is traditionally done at the state level : one constructs a physical hilbert space of states annihilated by the constraint operator(s ) and equipped with an invariant inner product .",
    "explicit constructions can be done in some special cases by different methods .    since explicit derivations are possible only in specific cases , it is not always clear whether the results are generic or mere artefacts of the simple models used .",
    "it is therefore important to have approximate methods for a wider range of cases , or at least to be able to perturb around known solvable ones while still ensuring that the constraints are solved and the observables are gauge invariant .",
    "it turns out that such perturbation schemes are most feasible if one deals with the observables directly , such as expectation values , side - stepping the computation and physical normalization of states .",
    "this procedure gives rise to canonical effective equations and constraints @xcite .",
    "a procedure for effective constraints has been formulated in @xcite and applied to parameterized non - relativistic systems with a constraint @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the momentum of time and @xmath2 the hamiltonian .",
    "( the concepts and results are reviewed briefly below . )",
    "it was shown that the physical observables in suitable regimes , including semiclassical ones , can be determined without making use of a physical inner product but instead through implementing reality conditions for quantum variables such as fluctuations , correlations and higher moments . for applications of these methods to quantum gravity and cosmology one has to extend them to relativistic systems , offering one additional subtlety : constraints would now be of the form @xmath3 , requiring one to take a square root and to make sign choices .",
    "mathematically , for instance , the question is how to precisely define @xmath4 at the operator level",
    ". this may not be obvious if the operator @xmath5 has a complicated spectrum or is not positive definite .",
    "physically , one must decide how to treat and separate positive and negative frequency solutions corresponding to the two solutions @xmath6 .",
    "( see e.g.  @xcite for discussions of relativistic systems . )    for a time - independent hamiltonian , it turns out that one can , at least for semiclassical purposes , simply use @xmath7 as the effective hamiltonian @xcite without absolute values , even if @xmath5 is not positive definite .",
    "one only has to ensure that the initial values used in the effective equations of motion correspond to an initial state supported on a part of the spectrum of @xmath5 with a definite sign .",
    "on such a state and with a self - adjoint @xmath5 , @xmath8 if the state is supported only on the positive part of the spectrum of @xmath5 , and @xmath9 if the state is supported only on the negative part .",
    "since the hamiltonian is preserved , these statements will hold true throughout the whole evolution and there is no need for an absolute value in the effective hamiltonian .",
    "this fact has been made use of in several recent derivations of effective equations in quantum cosmology , where the relevant versions of @xmath5 are not positive definite @xcite .    in those models ,",
    "deparameterization was performed using @xmath10 as an internal time from a free , massless scalar @xmath11 .",
    "the same types of models also allow the construction of a physical hilbert space at the state level @xcite , with the results in agreement with those obtained from effective equations .",
    "most interesting from the cosmological perspective is , however , a system where the scalar @xmath11 has a non - trivial potential or at least a mass term .",
    "this has two immediate implications : in general , one can no longer deparameterize globally since the solutions for the scalar would not be monotonic in the time coordinates , and the hamiltonian would no longer be ( internal ) time independent .",
    "positivity can no longer be ensured just by an initial condition , and using @xmath12 as an effective hamiltonian without an absolute value may then seem questionable . explicitly using an absolute value , on the other hand , would make a derivation of the effective equations more complicated . at this stage",
    ", a direct treatment of effective constraints for relativistic systems without deparameterization becomes relevant .",
    "this is what we present in the current paper .",
    "we will consider in detail models of relativistic particles and properties of observables in their quantum theories . in the massive case , for instance",
    ", we are dealing with the quantization and implementation of a constraint @xmath13 . for physical states ,",
    "the expectation value @xmath14 must vanish and thus represents a quantum constraint .",
    "( we will notationally identify classical degrees of freedom with the expectation values to simplify the notation and to show the relation between classical terms and quantum corrections .",
    "thus , @xmath15 and @xmath16 . )",
    "as we will see in more detail below , there are additional independent constraints since expressions such as @xmath17 must also vanish for physical states . allowing all possible factors to the left of @xmath18",
    ", this presents a constrained system of infinitely many constraints for infinitely many quantum variables given by the moments of a state .",
    "the combined system of all constraints must be solved to find observable results , which is feasible in semiclassical regimes where only a finite set of moments suffices to characterize a state approximately .",
    "the same kind of approximation also allows one to include potentials within the constraint , which may be explicitly time - dependent . we will exploit this to justify the procedures used in quantum cosmology for deparameterized systems with time - dependent potentials , as developed in @xcite .",
    "another question of interest is that of the spreading of states and quantum back - reaction of fluctuations and higher moments on the expectation values . if we compare the effective constraint @xmath19 written above , which contains only the second order moments in addition to the expectation values , with the effective hamiltonian of the corresponding deparameterized system , @xmath20 with a whole formal taylor series that includes higher moments , different coupling terms between the expectation values and the moments seem to be implied .",
    "then , back - reaction might seem different in these two treatments , apparently making them incompatible . by our specific constructions in this paper",
    "we will reconcile these apparent disagreements , and provide an illustration by numerical solutions in a specific example ( app .",
    "[ appii ] ) .",
    "this is also important for quantum cosmology , where quantum back - reaction is crucial to the understanding of how a quantum state evolves toward and possibly through the big bang and how much of the pre - big bang state can be reconstructed @xcite .",
    "in a canonical effective description , the dynamics of a quantum system with @xmath21 degrees of freedom is formulated in terms of the expectation values , i.e.  the evaluations of a state functional in the elements of an algebra @xmath22 generated by @xmath23 basic operators @xmath24 and @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "this whole set of infinitely many variables can be conveniently split into the @xmath23 expectation values of the basic operators , such as @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath26 , together with the infinitely many moments of the form @xmath29 where the subscript `` weyl '' denotes the totally symmetric ordering of all factors involved . between all these variables a poisson bracket",
    "is defined following from the algebra of commutation relations : @xmath30\\rangle}{i\\hbar}\\ ] ] extended using linearity and the leibniz rule .    at second order ,",
    "@xmath31 , this set of moments includes all fluctuations and covariances . in semiclassical regimes ,",
    "moments fall off at least as @xmath32 such that only low orders need to be considered for the first approximation to quantum effects . below we will employ the notation @xmath33 for fluctuations and @xmath34 for covariances , which may make second order equations easier to interpret .",
    "any operator @xmath35 gives rise to a function on the space of states , which can be expressed in terms of the moments by taylor expanding @xmath36 in @xmath37 and @xmath38 as in ( [ eexp ] ) .",
    "if @xmath39 is a constraint operator , ( [ quantcons ] ) must vanish on physical states and thus is a constraint on the quantum phase space .",
    "a single constraint on the phase space removes one pair of variables , but not the whole tower of moments associated with it in the quantum phase space . for a complete reduction",
    "one has to make use of additional constraints , provided by the set of phase space functions @xmath40 which must also vanish on physical states .",
    "these functions are in general independent from the quantum constraint @xmath41 as functions of expectation values and moments . as shown in @xcite , this set of constraints",
    "remains first class .",
    "( note that we do not order the products of the operators in the constraints symmetrically to ensure that the constraint operator acts directly on the state . as a result ,",
    "in some cases one has to deal with complex - valued constraints requiring reality conditions for physical observables .",
    "this has been discussed in @xcite and will also be seen in more detail in the examples below . )",
    "given such a system of constraints on the quantum phase space , one can proceed in the classical way and find the reduced quantum phase space of observables or solve the constraints and fix the gauge . at this stage , it is convenient ( but not required ) to decide which internal time variables @xmath42 among the @xmath43 should be used . since a quantization of the corresponding deparameterized system ,",
    "if it exists , would not give rise to any moment involving an operator of @xmath44 or @xmath1 , solving the constraints must remove all moments including at least one factor of @xmath45 or @xmath46 from the original quantum phase space . that this indeed happens was verified to second order of the parameterized non - relativistic particle in @xcite .",
    "in that case , there was a single linear term @xmath1 in the constraint , such that all @xmath1-moments @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 can be removed by solving the system of constraints , to second order : @xmath51 this leaves the moments @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which are removed by factoring out the gauge flow , or simply by setting them to zero as a well - defined set of gauge - fixing conditions .",
    "( note that a smaller number of gauge fixing conditions than constraints is required because the second order moments satisfy a poisson algebra which is degenerate from the symplectic point of view ; see @xcite for some notions of constrained systems in the non - symplectic case .",
    "additionally , setting the fluctuation @xmath55 to zero is consistent with the generalized uncertainty relation @xmath56 since @xmath57-correlations @xmath58 are required by the constraints , especially @xmath59 with the gauge fixing condition @xmath60 , to be imaginary and of just the right size to saturate the uncertainty relation . ) after solving the constraints and fixing the gauge , observable moments are recovered on which physical reality conditions can be imposed .",
    "classically a free relativistic particle is described by a single constraint @xmath61 on the phase space coordinatized by two canonical pairs @xmath62and @xmath63 . for the quantum version",
    "we consider the unital associative algebra generated by four basic elements @xmath64  subject to the canonical commutator relations .",
    "that is , @xmath22  consists of ( countable ) sums of polynomials of the form @xmath65 ; terms with a different ordering may be expressed using the commutation relations @xmath66",
    "= i\\hbar \\mathds{1 } \\quad , \\quad [ \\mathbf{q } , \\mathbf{p } ] = i \\hbar \\mathds{1}\\,.\\ ] ] there is no product - ordering ambiguity in the case of the above constraint and it is naturally identified with an element @xmath67  of @xmath22 . as the equivalent of dirac s",
    "condition @xmath68  we demand that the constraint has a vanishing right action on the states , which in our case are complex linear functions @xmath69 , this implies that @xmath70 ; henceforth we drop explicit reference to @xmath71  and write this condition as @xmath72 for the expectation value in a physical state @xmath71 . in order to impose all these conditions",
    "systematically we take the previously mentioned basis in @xmath22  and impose the constraint via an infinite ( but countable ) set of conditions @xmath73    we reduce the above infinite system of equations using the same method that was previously employed for a newtonian particle  @xcite  a semiclassical expansion based on the hierarchy @xmath74 of moments .      in",
    "what follows , we assume a semiclassical state and drop the terms of order @xmath75  and above , keeping the terms of order @xmath76  and below .",
    "this will suffice to demonstrate the feasibility of our methods for relativistic systems . to this order",
    "our system is described by fourteen independent functions : four expectation values of the form @xmath77 ; four spreads of the form @xmath78  and six covariances of the form @xmath79 .",
    "( poisson brackets between all these variables are listed in app .",
    "[ appi ] . ) the infinite system of constraint functions is reduced to just five non - trivial conditions @xmath80 note that the semiclassical hierarchy of variables is critical to the above reduction in the number of constraint conditions .",
    "in particular , @xmath81  implies that @xmath82 , which in turn implies that the combination of the expectation values @xmath83  is of order @xmath76  on the constraint surface . in other words , the classical constraint is satisfied to order @xmath76 .",
    "the terms of the form @xmath84  and @xmath85  are then of order @xmath86  and should be dropped in our present treatment .",
    "the complete infinite system of constraint functions is a closed poisson algebra  or , in the language of classical constraint analysis , a _ first - class _ system  @xcite . in general ,",
    "due to the nature of the above truncation one would expect the reduced system of constraints to remain closed only to order @xmath76 . in our case the poisson algebra of the truncated set of constraint functions  displayed in table  [ tab : pb_m]is _ exactly _ closed with respect to the bracket .",

    "here we consider the constrained system of section  [ sec : space_pot ] in a specific semiclassical state and compare the evolution of `` classical '' quantities given by the effective quantum theory to properties of the state .",
    "this appendix is included to address the riliability of an effective solution to a constrained quantum system through comparison within a specific example .",
    "recall the constraint : @xmath89 formally , a positive frequency solution of the constraint described in section  [ sec : space_pot ] reduces the system to one canonical degree of freedom that evolves subject to the hamiltonian @xmath90 .",
    "we begin by providing the classical trajectory : a canonical pair @xmath91 , @xmath92  subject to the hamiltonian function @xmath93  evolves according to the equations of motion : @xmath94 using the fact that @xmath2  itself is a constant of motion we differentiate the first equation above with respect to time to obtain the second order equation @xmath95 this equation has the general solution @xmath96 where @xmath97  and @xmath98  are constants .",
    "it follows that @xmath99 and thus @xmath100 .",
    "the classical phase - space trajectory is therefore a circle of radius @xmath101  traversed with the angular frequency @xmath102 .",
    "effective equations of motion are set up in much the same way as their classical counterparts .",
    "phase - space degrees of freedom are @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "the time evolution is generated by the function @xmath106  of equation  ( [ eq : e_space_pot ] ) through the quantum poisson bracket @xmath107 the first term in each of the first two equations is identical to the classical equations of motion , the extra terms constitute the leading order quantum corrections .",
    "the system of equations is straightforward to evolve numerically for a sufficiently short time starting from a state that is initially semiclassical .",
    "the quantum evolution of positive frequency solutions is governed by the schrdinger equation @xmath108 the square root operator has the same eigenstates @xmath109  as the one dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator , with eigenvalues @xmath110 .",
    "a wavefunction can be evolved by decomposing it into the eigenstates of the hamiltonian .",
    "if the state at @xmath111  is given by @xmath112 , where @xmath113  are constant complex numbers , then at any other time , the wavefunction is @xmath114 to compute the expectation values we write @xmath115 , @xmath116 , where @xmath117  and @xmath118  are the usual creation and annihilation operators of the quantum harmonic oscillator .",

    "in order to complete the comparison we select a semiclassical state with a known decomposition into the eigenstates @xmath123 . a simple choice is to set the initial wavefunction to be a coherent state of the harmonic oscillator @xmath124 which we can consider as a kinematical coherent state for our system . for the non - relativistic harmonic oscillator , as time goes on @xmath71 changes , but the shape of the state is preserved .",
    "clearly , this is not the case for our relativistic evolution : combining ( [ cn ] ) with ( [ psixt ] ) , we have an evolving state which , expanded in harmonic oscillator stationary states , has coefficients @xmath125 due to the square root in this relativistic model , these coefficients are not of the coherent state form ( [ cn ] ) unless @xmath126 .",
