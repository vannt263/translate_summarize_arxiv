    "one of the main obstacles to the experimental realisation of the ideas of quantum computation and quantum information is ` decoherence '  @xcite .",
    "there are many attempts to overcome this problem , and several approaches are proposed for it . among them are the ` purification / distillation ' technologies  @xcite , i.e.  methods to extract pure states , especially entanglements , from general mixed states recovering / preparing quantum coherence . contributing to this subject , we have recently proposed a novel method to purify quantum states , i.e.  purification through zeno - like measurements  @xcite . here",
    "we show that it is possible to apply it for extracting _",
    ", which is the key resource to the fundamentals of quantum computation and information .",
    "let us recapitulate the framework of our purification  @xcite .",
    "we consider two quantum systems x and a interacting with each other .",
    "the total system is initially in a general _ mixed _ state @xmath0 , from which we try to extract a pure state in a. we first make a measurement on x _ to confirm that it is in a given state @xmath1_. if it is found in the state @xmath1 , the state of the total system is projected by the projection operator @xmath2 we then let the total system start to evolve under the hamiltonian @xmath3 and repeat the same measurement on x at time intervals @xmath4 .",
    "after @xmath5 repetitions of successful confirmations , the state of the total system , @xmath6 , is given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the state of a after the zeroth confirmation , @xmath9 is a projected time - evolution operator , and @xmath10 is the normalisation factor , @xmath11 = \\tr_\\mathrm{a}[\\bm{(}v_\\phi(\\tau)\\bm{)}^n\\varrho_\\mathrm{a } \\bm{(}v_\\phi^\\dag(\\tau)\\bm{)}^n ] .",
    "\\label{eqn : yield}\\ ] ] note that we retain only the events where x is found in the state @xmath1 at _ every _ measurement ; other events , resulting in failure to purify a , are discarded .",
    "the normalisation factor @xmath10 in  ( [ eqn : yield ] ) is nothing but the probability for the _ successful events _ and is the probability of obtaining the state given in  ( [ eqn : statetotal ] ) and  ( [ eqn : statea ] ) .",
    "let us assume for simplicity that the eigenvalues @xmath12 of @xmath13 , which are complex - valued in general , are discrete and @xmath13 is decomposed ( diagonalised ) as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the right and left eigenvectors of @xmath13 , respectively , belonging to the eigenvalue @xmath12 and satisfy @xmath17 .",
    "( the right eigenvectors are normalised as @xmath18 in the following . )",
    "it is now easy to observe the asymptotic behaviour of the state of a in  ( [ eqn : statea ] ) . since the eigenvalues @xmath12 are bounded as @xmath19 , each term in the expansion of @xmath20 decays away and a single term dominates asymptotically as the number of measurements , @xmath5 , increases , @xmath21 _ provided the largest ( in magnitude ) eigenvalue @xmath22 is unique , discrete and nondegenerate_. then , the state of a in  ( [ eqn : statea ] ) accordingly approaches the pure state @xmath23 , @xmath24 this is the purification we have found recently  @xcite : extraction of a pure state @xmath23 from an _ arbitrary _ mixed state @xmath25 through repeated measurements on x. since we repeat measurements ( on x ) as in the case of the quantum zeno effect  @xcite , we call such measurements ` zeno - like measurements . ' in this scheme is not necessarily small as in the ordinary zeno measurements , and the purification  ( [ eqn : purification ] ) is not due to the quantum zeno effect . ]",
    "the above observation shows that the assumption of the ` spectral decomposition '  ( [ eqn : spectraldecomp ] ) is not essential but the existence of the _",
    "unique , discrete and nondegenerate largest eigenvalue @xmath22 _ is crucial for the purification .",
    "furthermore , note the asymptotic behaviour of the ` success probability ' @xmath10 : it decays asymptotically as @xmath26 which is dominated by the eigenvalue @xmath22 .",
    "efficient purification is possible if it satisfies the condition @xmath27 , which suppresses the decay in  ( [ eqn : decay ] ) . at the same time , if the other eigenvalues are much smaller than @xmath22 in magnitude , purification is achieved faster .",
    "hence , @xmath28 are the conditions for the _ efficient purification _ , which we try to achieve by adjusting parameters such as @xmath4 , @xmath1 and those in the hamiltonian @xmath3 .",
    "now we show an interesting application of the above scheme : application to _",
    "entanglement purification_. let us consider , for example , a three - qubit system with the hamiltonian @xmath29 where @xmath30 are the pauli operators and @xmath31 are the ladder operators .",
    "qubit x is coupled to qubits a and b. we confirm x to be in the state @xmath1 repeatedly at time intervals @xmath4 and end up with an extraction of an entanglement between a and b , which are initially in a general mixed state @xmath0 .    the projected time - evolution operator @xmath13 is given , in this case , by @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 , with @xmath35 the eigenstates of @xmath36 belonging to the eigenvalues @xmath37 .",
    "since the hamiltonian  ( [ eqn : threequbitsystem ] ) is symmetric under the exchange between a and b , @xmath13 splits into the singlet and triplet sectors , and the singlet state @xmath38 is one of the four eigenstates of @xmath13 .",
    "it is hence possible to extract a bell state @xmath38 provided ( i )  the corresponding eigenvalue @xmath39 is larger ( in magnitude ) than any other eigenvalue , and the extraction is efficient if the conditions ( [ eqn : optimization ] ) , i.e.  ( ii )  @xmath40 and ( iii )  @xmath41 , are fulfilled",
    ".    condition  ( ii ) is achieved by tuning @xmath4 such as @xmath42 and condition  ( i ) is possible unless @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "let us hence consider , under the condition  ( [ eqn : tuning ] ) , the case where @xmath45 in this case , three other eigenvalues than @xmath46 are given by @xmath47 whose magnitudes are less than @xmath48 , fulfilling condition  ( i ) , when @xmath49 therefore , the set of such parameters as  ( [ eqn : tuning ] ) , ( [ eqn : confirmx ] ) and ( [ eqn : coupling ] ) enables us to extract the bell state @xmath38 from a general mixed state @xmath0",
    ".    the extraction of the bell state @xmath38 is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : fidelity ] , where the fidelity to the target state @xmath38 , defined by @xmath50 , and the success probability @xmath10 versus the number of measurements , @xmath5 , are shown for the initial state @xmath51 , a ( pure but ) product state [ or for a mixed state @xmath52 .     from a product state @xmath53 [ or from a mixed state @xmath52 .",
    "parameters are @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 ( @xmath57).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    it is clear that the bell state @xmath38 is extracted after only @xmath58 or @xmath59 measurements ( in this case , @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) . since condition  ( ii )",
    "is fulfilled , the decay of the success probability @xmath10 is suppressed , yielding @xmath62(@xmath63 in figure  [ fig : fidelity ] ) , which means that the @xmath64 component contained in the initial state @xmath65 ( after the zeroth measurement on @xmath0 ) is fully extracted . in this sense , the extraction is _ optimal_.",
    "the above example clearly and explicitly shows that our purification scheme works for entanglement purification .",
    "it is quite simple : one has simply to repeat one and the same measurement . at the same time",
    ", the purification can be made optimal : the optimal success probability is attainable as in the above example . since the basic framework presented in section  [ sec : framework ] is general , it possesses wide potential applicabilities in various settings for quantum computation and quantum information .",
