    "we also aim to solve this problem in the case where @xmath5 is a feller process of the spectrally negative type , that is , when it has only negative jumps .",
    "it is of common use to name  @xmath12 as the reward function , @xmath21 as the cost of observations and @xmath22 as the random discount factor .",
    "we mention that in the case @xmath23 and @xmath24 the problem ( [ eqoptstop ] ) has been studied by dynkin  @xcite and shiryaev @xcite in the general framework of markov processes .",
    "moreover , the case @xmath25 , that is , without cost of observations , has been intensively studied in the literature for one - dimensional diffusions . in particular , salminen @xcite by means of the martin boundary , suggested a solution to this problem in terms of the excessive majorant function .",
    "more recently , beibel and lerche @xcite , relying on martingales arguments , solve this optimal stopping problem explicitly .",
    "we also mention that , by using standard fluctuation theory , kyprianou and pistorius @xcite offer solution to some optimal stopping problem arising in financial mathematics for appropriate diffusions . a related result on optimal stopping problems for one - dimensional diffusions with discounting has been presented by dayanik and karatzas  @xcite .",
    "they characterize excessive functions via generalized concavity and determined the value function as the smallest concave majorant of the reward function . in the former case ,",
    "the value function is given as the solution of a free boundary value problem associated to a second order differential operator which is the infinitesimal generator of the one - dimensional diffusion @xmath5 .",
    "the term _ free _ , which comes from the a priori , unknown region where the problem is investigated , forces one to set up an artificial boundary condition of neumann type to get a well - posed problem .",
    "this is the so - called smooth fit principle .",
    "all these techniques are well explained in the book of peskir and shiryaev @xcite .",
    "the literature regarding optimal stopping problems associated to diffusion with jumps is more sparse and focused essentially on the study of specific examples . in this vein , we mention the paper of alili and kyprianou @xcite where the authors deal with the issue of pricing perpetual american put options in a  market driven by lvy processes . we also indicate that baurdoux  @xcite solved an optimal stopping problem associated to generalized ornstein  uhlenbeck processes of the spectrally negative type .    in this paper , we propose to solve the optimal stopping problem ( [ eqoptstop ] ) with a cost of observations of the form ( [ eqcostobserv ] ) for one - dimensional regular diffusions .",
    "our strategy can be described as follows .",
    "first , by a time change device , we reduce the optimal stopping problem with random discounting to a one with a deterministic discount factor but associated to an appropriate time change diffusion .",
    "then , by an argument of potential theory , we transform the problem ( [ eqoptstop ] ) to an optimal stopping problem of the same form with a new reward function but without cost of observations .",
    "we proceed by using a result of shiryaev  @xcite which states that in our context the optimal stopping time is the first exit time of the process from a borel set .",
    "finally , with this information at hand , we can use a doob s @xmath26-transform technique , with a proper choice of the excessive function , to transform our problem to an optimization problem which has been studied in detail by beibel and lerche  @xcite .",
    "the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we overview the basic facts about one - dimensional diffusions . in section  [ sec3 ] , we state and",
    "prove our main result which consists of solving the general optimal stopping problem ( [ eqoptstop ] ) .",
    "we also show , in section  [ sec4 ] , how to generalize our result to the class of regular one - sided feller processes .",
    "the last section is devoted to the treatment of new examples ranging from linear diffusions to processes with one sided jumps , such as spectrally negative lvy processes and self - similar positive markov processes of the spectrally negative type .",
    "in this part , we provide some well - known facts about linear diffusions which can be found , for instance , in it and mckean @xcite and in borodin and salminen  @xcite .",
    "we recall that @xmath27 is a filtered probability space .",
    "we consider a linear diffusion @xmath28 with state space @xmath13 , as the solution to the stochastic differential equation ( sde ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a one - dimensional brownian motion .",

    "more specifically , we have @xmath41 where @xmath42 stands for the transition probability density which may be taken to be positive , jointly continuous in all variables and symmetric .",
    "the scale function @xmath43 of @xmath5 is an increasing continuous function from @xmath13 to @xmath2 , satisfying , for any @xmath44 , @xmath45 and is given by @xmath46 we also recall that the infinitesimal generator @xmath47 of @xmath5 is the second order differential operator given , for a function @xmath48 , the space of infinitely continuously differentiable functions with compact support , by @xmath49 next , from the general theory of one - dimensional diffusion ( see @xcite , page  128 ) , the laplace transform of the first hitting time @xmath50 is expressed , for any @xmath51 , as @xmath52 = \\cases { \\dfrac{h^+_q(x)}{h^+_q(y ) } , & \\quad $ x\\leq y$,\\vspace*{2pt}\\cr \\dfrac{h^-_q(x)}{h^-_q(y ) } , & \\quad $ x\\geq y$,}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 ( resp . , @xmath54 )",

    "on the other hand , it is associated to a new diffusion obtained from the original one by a  random time change and by a  doob s @xmath26-transform .",
    "it turns out that solving this latter optimal stopping problem amounts to finding the solution of an optimization problem which has been studied by beibel and lerche  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , our approach can then be split into the following three steps .",
    "first , we time change @xmath5 by the inverse of the continuous increasing functional @xmath22 and we use the well - known fact that in our context the two processes have identical hitting time distributions . hence , we may consider without loss of generality the problem ( [ eqoptstop ] ) with linear discounting , that is , @xmath80 for some constant @xmath51 .",
    "then , we characterize the potential associated to the functional @xmath81 and we show how to reduce our problem to an optimal stopping problem without cost of observations but involving a new reward function .",
    "finally , we borrow an idea of williams  @xcite and pitman and yor  @xcite for constructing conditioned diffusions by the method of @xmath26-transform .",
    "we transform the problem described in item ( 2 ) to an optimal stopping problem without discounting factor which has been solved by shiryaev @xcite .",
    "we start our program by considering that @xmath22 is a nonnegative continuous additive functional of @xmath5 of the form ( [ addfunctional ] ) and we assume , without loss of generality , that @xmath82 @xmath83 a.s .",
    "since @xmath22 is a continuous increasing function , it admits an inverse functional which we denote by @xmath84 and given , for all @xmath18 , by @xmath85 where @xmath86 for any @xmath87 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath5 is the solution to the sde ( [ eqsde ] ) , then it follows , from the it s formula , that @xmath88 is the unique solution to the sde @xmath89 where @xmath90 is a brownian motion with respect to the filtration @xmath91 .",
    "the process @xmath88 remains a linear diffusion with respect to the filtration @xmath92 .",
    "in particular , it is a feller process ( see , e.g. , lamperti @xcite ) and its infinitesimal generator @xmath93 takes the form @xmath94 for a smooth function @xmath95 on @xmath13 .",
    "next , we consider an open interval @xmath96 and denote by @xmath97 the first exit time of the process @xmath88 from @xmath98 , it is plain that we have the following identity : @xmath99 we are now ready to state the following .",
