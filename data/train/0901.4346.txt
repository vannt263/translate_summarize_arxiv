    "wilson et al .  ( 2008 ) recently reported the discovery of wasp-4b , a giant planet that orbits and transits a g7v star with a period of 1.34  days .",
    "this discovery is notable because the planet has an unusually large radius and short orbital period , and the star is one of the brightest transit hosts that is known in the southern sky ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the large radius seems to place the planet among the `` bloated '' planets for which there is no clear explanation ( see , e.g. , burrows et al .  2007 , guillot 2008 ) .",
    "the short period raises the possibility of observing tidal decay ( rasio et al .",
    "1996 , sasselov 2003 ) and makes wasp-4b an attractive target for observations of occultations ( secondary eclipses ) that would lead to detections of the reflected light and thermal emission from the planet s atmosphere .",
    "the host star s brightness and southern declination are important for a practical reason : they allow the large - aperture telescopes of the southern hemisphere to be used advantageously . in this paper",
    ", we report on observations of a transit of wasp-4b with the magellan / baade 6.5 m telescope , with the goal of deriving independent and refined parameters for this interesting system .",
    "previous papers in this series , the transit light curve project , have achieved this goal by combining the information from many independent transit observations with smaller telescopes ( see , e.g. , holman et al .",
    "2006 , winn et al .  2007 ) .",
    "in principle , with a larger telescope , it should be possible to achieve this goal with fewer observations and also to measure precise midtransit times , which can be used to search for additional planets via the method of holman & murray ( 2005 ) and agol et al .",
    "gillon et al .",
    "( 2008 ) recently presented photometry of wasp-4 with one of the 8.2 m very large telescopes , with the same motivation .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "  2 describes the observations and data reduction , ",
    "3 describes the photometric analysis , ",
    "4 describes the results of stellar - evolutionary modeling , and   5 discusses the newly - measured midtransit times and a refined ephemeris . finally , ",
    "6 discusses the refined measurement of the planetary radius , and considers how small a planet we could have detected , given data of the quality presented here .",
    "we observed the transits of ut  2008  aug  19 and 2008  oct  09 with the baade  6.5 m telescope , one of the two magellan telescopes at las campanas observatory in chile .",
    "we used the raymond and beverly sackler magellan instant camera ( magic ) and its site @xmath7  pixel ccd detector , with a scale of @xmath8  pixel@xmath9 .",
    "ordinarily this detector uses four amplifiers , each of which reads a quadrant of the array , giving a total readout time of 23  s. we used a @xmath10  pixel subarray and a single amplifier , giving a readout time of 10  s. we rotated the field of view to align wasp-4 and a nearby comparison star along the long axis of the subarray ( parallel to the read register ) .",
    "the comparison star is @xmath11 east and @xmath12 south of wasp-4 . at the start of each night",
    ", we verified that the time stamps recorded by magic were in agreement with gps - based times to within one second . on each night",
    "we obtained repeated @xmath13-band exposures of wasp-4 and the comparison star for about 5  hr bracketing the predicted transit time .",
    "autoguiding kept the image registration constant to within 10  pixels over the course of the night .    during the 2008  aug  19 observations",
    ", wasp-4 rose from an airmass of 1.09 to 1.03 , and then set to an airmass of 1.23 . at first",
    ", we used an exposure time of 30  s. shortly after midtransit the seeing improved abruptly , from a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) of 11 pixels to 7 pixels . as a result of the higher rate of detected photons per pixel ,",
    "some images were spoiled due to nonlinearity and saturation . for the rest of the night we used an exposure time of @xmath14  s.    during the 2008  oct  09 observations , wasp-4 rose from an airmass of 1.10 to 1.03 , and then set to an airmass of 1.21 .",
    "having learned our lesson in august , we deliberately defocused the telescope so that the image width was dominated by the effects of the telescope aberration rather than natural seeing .",
    "this was done by moving the secondary mirror by a constant displacement relative to the in - focus position determined by the guider probe .",
    "the exposure time was @xmath15  s. the stellar images were `` donuts '' with a diameter of approximately 25  pixels .",
    "we used standard iraf procedures for overscan correction , trimming , bias subtraction , and flat - field division .",
    "the bias frame was calculated from the median of 60  zero - second exposures , and the flat field for each night was calculated from the median of 60  @xmath13-band exposures of a dome flat screen .",
    "we performed aperture photometry of wasp-4 and the comparison star and divided the flux of wasp-4 by the flux of the comparison star .",
    "we experimented with different aperture sizes and sky regions , aiming to minimize the variations in the out - of - transit ( oot ) portion of the differential light curve .",
    "best results were obtained with an aperture radius of 38  pixels for the 2008  aug  19 observations and 35  pixels for the 2008  oct  09 observations .",
    "a few images were also obtained with johnson - cousins @xmath16 filters to measure the difference in color between wasp-4 and the comparison star . the instrumental magnitude differences ( target minus wasp-4 ) were @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",
    "evidently the two stars are similar in color , with the comparison star being slightly bluer [ @xmath21 . as described in   3 ,",
    "the @xmath13-band time series was corrected for differential extinction between the target and comparison star by fitting a linear function of airmass to the magnitude difference .",
    "the results were consistent with the expectation that the bluer comparison star suffers from greater extinction per unit airmass .",
    "the extinction - corrected data are given in table  [ tbl : phot ] , and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : phot ] , along with the best - fitting model .    due to the abrupt seeing change on 2008  aug  19 and the associated change in exposure level , we consider the 15  s and 30  s exposures as two separate time series ( ts1 and ts2 ) .",
    "thus , together with the 2008  oct  09 time series ( ts3 ) , there were 3 time series to be analyzed .",
    "the ts1 pre - ingress data has a median time sampling of 41  s and a standard deviation of 478  parts per million ( ppm ) .",
    "the ts2 post - egress data has a median time sampling of 26  s and a standard deviation of 691  ppm .",
    "these noise levels are about 13% larger than the calculated noise due to photon - counting statistics , read noise , sky noise , and scintillation noise ( using the approximate formulas of reiger  1963 and young  1967 ) .",
    "the ratio of the observed ts1 noise to the observed ts2 noise is 0.69 , which is nearly equal to @xmath22 .",
    "the near - equality is evidence that the dominant noise source is a combination of photon noise and scintillation noise , both of which vary as @xmath23 . in the final version of ts3 , which has a median time sampling of 41  s ,",
    "the pre - ingress data has an rms of 475  ppm and the post - egress data has an rms of 488  ppm .",
    "these values are about 17% above the calculated noise level . in neither light curve",
    "did we detect signficant correlation between the noise and the pixel coordinates , fwhm , or shape parameters of the stellar images .",

    "we fitted a transit light curve model to the data , based on the analytic formulae of mandel & agol ( 2002 ) .",
    "the set of model parameters included the planet - to - star radius ratio @xmath52 , the ratio of the stellar radius to the orbital semimajor axis @xmath53 , the orbital inclination ( @xmath54 ) , and the midtransit time @xmath55 ) .",
    "we also fitted for three parameters ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) specifying a correction for systematic errors , @xmath59 where @xmath13 is the airmass , @xmath60 is the time , @xmath61 is the observed magnitude difference between the target and comparison star , and @xmath62 is the corrected magnitude difference that is compared to the idealized transit model .",
    "the @xmath57 term specifies the differential airmass extinction correction that was mentioned in   2 .",
    "the @xmath58 term was not strictly necessary to fit the data ( it was found to be consistent with zero ) , but we included it in order to derive conservative error estimates for the transit times , as the parameter @xmath58 is covariant with the transit time .",
    "we allowed @xmath63 , @xmath58 , and @xmath57 to be specific to each time series , with the exception that ts1 and ts2 had a common value of @xmath57 because those data were obtained on the same night .",
    "the final two model parameters were the coefficients ( @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) of a quadratic limb - darkening law , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the cosine of the angle between the line of sight and the normal to the stellar photosphere , and @xmath68 is the specific intensity .",
    "we allowed @xmath64 and @xmath65 to vary freely subject only to the conditions @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 .",
    "it proved advantageous to perform the fit using the linear combinations @xmath72 because @xmath73 and @xmath74 have nearly uncorrelated errors ( for further discussion , see pl  2008 ) .",
    "we assumed the orbit to be circular because the rv data of wilson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are consistent with a circular orbit , and because the expected timescale for orbital circularization at present , @xmath75 ( rasio et al .",
    "1996 ) is 0.3  myr  @xmath76 for wasp-4b , which is much shorter than the estimated main - sequence age of the star . in this expression",
    ", @xmath77 is the the tidal dissipation parameter ( see , e.g. , goldreich & soter 1966 ) .",
    "this order - of - magnitude argument suggests that assuming a circular orbit is reasonable , although the value of @xmath77 for irradiated giant planets is highly uncertain , and the expected timescale is highly approximate because it ignores the coupled evolution of the orbital distance and eccentricity ( jackson , greenberg , & barnes 2008 ) .",

    "we determined appropriate values of @xmath81 as follows .",
    "first , we multiplied the calculated errors in each time series by a constant chosen to give a minimum value of @xmath82 .",
    "the constants were 1.20 , 1.12 , and 1.21 for ts1 , ts2 , and ts3 respectively .",
    "next , we assessed the time - correlated noise ( also called `` red noise '' ) by examining the autocorrelation function , the power spectrum , and a plot of the allan ( 1966 ) deviation of the residuals .",
    "we also used the method described by winn et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , in which the ratio @xmath83 is computed between the standard deviation of time - averaged residuals , and the standard deviation one would expect assuming white noise . for ts1 and ts2",
    "we found no evidence for significant correlations .",
    "for ts3 we found structure in the autocorrelation function on a time scale of 15 - 20  min , the approximate ingress or egress duration , giving @xmath84 .",
    "one naturally suspects that the correlated noise represents measurement error , although it is also possible that the noise is astrophysical , arising from starspots or other stellar inhomogeneities . in support of an astrophysical origin",
    ", we find no evidence for correlated noise ( @xmath85 ) when considering only the out - of - transit data .",
    "nevertheless we can not draw a firm conclusion ; instead we attempt to account for the correlations by multiplying the error bars of ts  3 by an additional factor of @xmath84 .",
    "thus , for ts1 , ts2 , and ts3 , the final values of @xmath81 were equal to the calculated error bars multiplied by 1.20 , 1.12 , and @xmath86 , respectively .",
    "the error bars given in table  1 are the final values of @xmath81 that were used in the fitting process .",
    "to determine the allowed ranges of each parameter , we used a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) technique , with the gibbs sampler and the metropolis - hastings algorithm , to estimate the _ a posteriori _ joint probability distribution of all the model parameters .",
    "this algorithm creates a sequence of points ( a `` chain '' ) in parameter space by iterating a jump function , which in our case was the addition of a gaussian random deviate to a randomly - selected single parameter .",
    "after this operation , if the new point has a lower @xmath87 than the previous point , the `` jump '' is executed : the new point is added to the chain . if not , then the jump is executed with probability @xmath88 .",
    "when the jump is not executed , the current point is repeated in the chain .",
    "the sizes of the random deviates are adjusted so that @xmath8940% of jumps are executed . after creating 10 chains of 500,000 links to check for mutual convergence , and trimming the first 20% of the links to eliminate artifacts of the initial conditions , the density of the chains points in parameter space was taken to be the joint _ a posteriori _ probability distribution of the parameter values .",
    "probability distributions for individual parameters are created by marginalizing over all other parameters .",
    "the results are given in table  [ tbl : params ] , which gives the median of each distribution , along with the 68.3% lower and upper confidence limits ( defined by the 15.85% and 84.15% levels of the cumulative distribution ) .",

    "in addition , gillon et al .",
    "( 2008 ) found a much stronger influence of correlated noise on the results for the midtransit time . in the language of ",
    "3 , their rp - based error bar was 300%400% larger than the mcmc - based error bar , as compared to 425% in our case .",
    "we also question the applicability of the `` small - planet '' approximation used by gillon et al .",
    "( 2008 ) . with our data",
    ", using the small - planet approximation would have led to an erroneous 2.3@xmath92 shift in @xmath90 .    for the key parameter @xmath166 , wilson et al .",

    "( 2008 ) found @xmath214  @xmath3 , and we find @xmath215  @xmath3 . here",
    "it is important to reiterate that the estimate of @xmath166 relied on the y@xmath182 isochrones , which probably contribute an additional systematic error of a few percent . despite this",
    ", it seems clear that wasp-4b is a member of the class of `` bloated '' planets , by which we mean planets that are larger than predicted according to theoretical models of solar - composition gas giant planets , even after accounting for the intense irradiation from the parent star .",
    "bodenheimer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) predicted the radii of giant planets as a function of the age , mass , and equilibrium temperature , defined as @xmath216^{1/4 } = ~~(1677~{\\rm k})~(1-a)^{1/4},\\ ] ] where @xmath217 is the bond albedo , @xmath218 is the stellar luminosity , @xmath92 is the stefan - boltzmann constant , and @xmath219 is the semimajor axis . in the latter equality",
    "we have evaluated @xmath220 for wasp-4b using the results given in table  [ tbl : params ] . as long as the albedo is not very close to unity , bodenheimer et al .",
    "( 2003 ) predict a planetary radius of 1.13  @xmath3 for a solar composition at 4.5  gyr . this is smaller than the observed radius by 11@xmath92 .",
    "fortney et al .  ( 2007 ) presented theoretical models parameterized by mass , age , and an effective orbital distance , defined as the distance from the sun where a hypothetical planet would receive the same flux as the actual planet , @xmath221 where again we have evaluated the expression as appropriate for wasp-4b . for a solar composition at 4.5  gyr , fortney et al .",
    "( 2007 ) predict @xmath222  @xmath3 , about 10@xmath92 smaller than the observed value .",
    "neither of these sets of models takes into account the `` transit radius effect '' of burrows et al .",
    "( 2003)the underprediction of transit radii by modelers who use an inappropriately high pressure to define the radius of their models  but this effect is expected to be only a few percent according to fortney et al .",
    "( 2007 ) .",
    "one might suppose that the system is young , and has therefore not had as much time to contract from its presumably hot and distended initial state .",
    "for an age of 300  myr , fortney et al .",
    "( 2007 ) predict a radius of @xmath223  @xmath3 , only 3@xmath92 smaller than the observed value ( and perhaps consistent , given the systematic errors in the isochrones and the transit radius effect ) .",
    "however , such a young age is disfavored by our isochrone analysis , and wilson et al .",
    "( 2008 ) have also argued that the star is older than about 2  gyr based on a nondetection of li  i  ( @xmath224   ) in the spectrum .",
    "another possible resolution is to invoke an extra source of internal heat ( of unspecified origin ) within the planet .",
    "liu et al .  (",
    "2008 ) have provided useful fitting formulas to gauge how much extra power is required , for a solar - composition planet of a given mass and effective orbital distance .",
    "they are parameterized by the variable @xmath225 , defined as the ratio of the extra power to the incident power from the host star s radiation . by interpolating table  3 of liu et al .",
    "( 2008 ) we find that to match the observed radius of wasp-4b , one needs an `` anomalous '' heating rate of @xmath89@xmath226% of the incident power from the host star , or @xmath89@xmath227  erg  s@xmath9 . according to the same tables ,",
    "the equilibrium radius is achieved in @xmath8930  myr .",
    "of course the preceding calculation does not solve the problem of the bloated planet .",
    "it merely quantifies the power requirement for the unknown heat source .",
    "the calculations of liu et al .",
    "( 2008 ) were in the context of tidal heating due to orbital circularization .",
    "according to their eq .",
    "( a3 ) , an orbital eccentricity of @xmath228 would suffice to produce enough power to inflate the planet to the requisite degree .",
    "hence for @xmath77 between @xmath229 and @xmath230 , the required eccentricity for this hypothesis is about @xmath231 to @xmath232 .",
    "this is small enough to be compatible with the rv data , but larger than expected based on the estimated stellar age and the order - of - magnitude timescale for tidal circularization ( see   3 ) , unless there is a third body whose gravitational influence is preventing circularization .",
    "a very precise measurement of the time of occultation of wasp-4b by its host star might allow the orbital eccentricity ( or more precisely @xmath233 , where @xmath234 is the argument of pericenter ) to be measured well enough to test this notion .",
    "of course , many other ways to explain the radii of the bloated planets have been given in the literature ( guillot & showman 2002 , showman & guillot 2002 , bodenheimer et al .",
    "2003 , burrows et al .",
    "2007 , chabrier & baraffe 2007 ) .",
    "this issue remains unresolved for the particular case of wasp-4b and for the entire ensemble .",
    "in addition to refining the estimates of planetary parameters , and seeking additional bodies through transit timing , an important application of precise differential photometry is checking for transits of planets that have been detected by the doppler technique but for which the orbital inclination is unknown . given the progress of the doppler surveys in finding lower - mass planets , it is also a likely route to the discovery of the first examples of `` super - earth '' planets that transit bright stars , and that are therefore valuable for understanding the sizes , orbits , and atmospheres of terrestrial planets .",
    "it is generally thought that detection of transits of terrestrial - mass planets must be done from space , to eliminate the contaminating effects of earth s atmosphere and to observe for long intervals without interruptions due to bad weather and the day / night cycle . these are clear advantages but they must be weighed against the high cost of space missions .",
    "it is interesting to contemplate how small a planet we would have been able to detect , given data of the quality presented here .",
    "our light curve has a signal - to - noise ratio of approximately @xmath235 , using the notation of carter et al .",
    "( 2008 ) in which @xmath236 is the number of data points per transit duration , @xmath237 is the transit depth , and @xmath92 the photometric precision .",
    "statistically one might expect that we would have achieved a 5@xmath92 detection of a planet that has an area @xmath238 times smaller than wasp-4b , i.e. , a planet with @xmath239  @xmath5 .",
    "however , it is not clear whether a statistically unassailable 5@xmath92 detection would really be credible , given the possible presence of systematic trends , correlated errors , uncertainty in predicted transit times , and general caution .    to judge the believability of a super - earth detection",
    ", we added to the residuals of fig .  2 a model light curve of a transiting super - earth .",
    "all of the parameters of the model were the same as the actual wasp-4b parameters except the planetary radius , which was reduced to 1.75  @xmath5 , the approximate upper limit that is predicted for terrestrial planets .",
    "the result , shown in fig .",
    "3 , gives a visual impression of what one might realistically expect , based on two nights of observations of a 12th magnitude star with a large telescope .",
    "we fitted this simulated data in nearly the same way that we fitted the wasp-4 data .",
    "the only difference is that we fixed the values of the limb - darkening parameters and the stellar radius , as befits a detection rather than a characterization experiment .",
    "we also assumed the orbital period was known to within 10% ( 3.2",
    "the free parameters were @xmath52 ; @xmath54 ; the two mid - transit times ; and the parameters describing systematic trends , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , for each time series .",
    "the results were that @xmath52 was consistent with the input value and had an error of 14% , dominated by the correlation with the poorly - constrained orbital inclination .",
    "the transit times were recovered within 5  min .",
    "the detection is visually apparent in the time - binned light curve shown in the lower panel of fig .",
    "one would certainly prefer a longer stretch of out - of - transit data , especially if the orbital period has a large uncertainty .",
    "nevertheless the impression given is that the detection of transits of super - earths around sun - like stars is within reach of ground - based observations .",
