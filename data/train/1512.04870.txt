    "disorder in bose gases appears either naturally as , e.g. , in magnetic wire traps @xcite , where imperfections of the wire itself can induce local disorder , or it may be created artificially and controllably as , e.g. , by using laser speckle fields @xcite . a set - up more in the spirit of condensed matter physics relies on a bose gas with impurity atoms of another species trapped in a deep optical lattice , so the latter represent randomly distributed scatterers @xcite .",

    "was obtained by huang and meng , who found , within the bogoliubov theory @xcite , that a weak disorder potential with delta correlation leads to a depletion of both the condensate and the superfluid density due to the localization of bosons in the respective minima of the random potential @xcite . later on their theory",
    "was extended in different research directions .",
    "results for the shift of the velocity of sound as well as for its damping due to collisions with the external field are worked out in ref .",

    "@xcite and laser speckles are treated at zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite .",
    "also the disorder - induced shift of the critical temperature was analyzed in refs .",
    "furthermore , it was shown that dirty dipolar bose gases yield characteristic directional dependences for thermodynamic quantities due to the emerging anisotropy of superfluidity at zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite .",

    "in addition , increasing the disorder strength at small temperatures yields a first - order quantum phase transition from a superfluid to a bose - glass phase , where in the latter case all particles reside in the respective minima of the random potential .",
    "this prediction is achieved at zero temperature by solving the underlying gross - pitaevskii equation with a random phase approximation @xcite , as well as at finite temperature by a stochastic self - consistent mean - field approach using two chemical potentials , one for the condensate and one for the excited particles @xcite .",
