    "fast shocks produced by the radio jet can modify the shape of the nlr by compressing the gas and producing line emission enhancement in regions next to radio structures .",
    "usually , the interaction of the radio jet with the nlr is seen only in association with the high frequency radio emission ( e.g. , from 1.6 to 15 ghz ) . on the other hand , outflows observed in seyfert galaxies are not usually originated by the interaction of the radio jet with the nlr gas , but by the interaction of winds from the accretion disk with gas from the circumnuclear region of the galaxy .",

    "ngc5929 is a spiral galaxy harboring a seyfert2 nucleus , located at a distance 35.9mpc , for which 1 arcsec corresponds to @xmath0175pc at the galaxy .",
    "it presents a well defined bi - polar radio jet oriented along the position angle pa@xmath160@xmath6 , showing a triple structure with two bright hot spots , one located at 05 north - east from the nucleus and the other at 06 south - west from it .",

    "the gas kinematics of the nuclear region of ngc5929 has been discussed in several previous works , but its origin is still not well understood @xcite . in this letter , we present 2d kinematic maps of the inner 250pc ( radius ) of ngc5929 and report the observation of double - component emission at the location of the radio hot spots , but also along a 50pc wide strip perpendicular to the radio jet using near - infrared integral field spectroscopy at gemini north telescope .",

    "the total on - source exposure time for each band was 6000s and the observations were split into 10 individual on source exposures plus 5 sky exposures for each band .",
    "the final data cubes cover the inner 3@xmath93@xmath10 of ngc5929 at an angular resolution is 012 ( corresponding to @xmath020pc at the galaxy ) and velocity resolution of @xmath040kms@xmath11 .",
    "in order to construct flux , velocity dispersion ( @xmath12 ) and centroid velocity maps for the emitting gas ( , , 2  and h recombination lines ) , we first fitted the emission - line profiles by a single gaussian , using the profit fitting routine @xcite .",

    ".  [ fits ] ) .",
    "besides this criterium , if the two components present differences in velocity less than our spectral resolution ( @xmath140 ) and/or one component had a flux lower than 5% of the other one , we used the result of the fit of a single gaussian .",

    "it can be seen that the highest blueshifts  of up to @xmath19600   correspond to the bluest components of the two component fit in the region of the north - east hotspot , while the highest redshifts  of up to 600 are the reddest components of the two component fit in the region of the south - east hotspot .",
    "optical integral field spectroscopy ( ifs ) was obtained for the first time for ngc5929 by @xcite at an angular resolution of @xmath11 arcsec and spectral resolution of r@xmath01400 .",

    "they report the finding that the width of the [ oiii]@xmath205007 emission - line at the nucleus is twice its width to the ne and sw , attributing this to the interaction with the radio jet , but their measurements did not allowed to resolve the extent of the region at the nucleus with high velocity dispersions , neither conclude that the emission lines actually had two velocity components .",
    "@xcite found kinematic shock signatures attributed to the interaction of the radio jet with the nlr gas in ngc5929 using hst optical images , long - slit spectra and a 5ghz radio image .",
    "they compared the emission line profiles of h@xmath21 with those of [ oiii]@xmath22 at distinct positions in the galaxy and found that they have similar widths at most locations , except in a region surrounding the north - eastern radio hot spot .",
    "there , the h@xmath21 profile is broader than that of [ oiii ] , suggesting that the low - ionization gas at the interaction site is more disturbed than the high - ionization gas .",
    "the authors attributed this broadening to a local enhancement of shock ionization due to the influence of the jet . the spectra shown by @xcite",
    "does not include observations in the direction perpendicular to the radio jet , thus missing the se - nw strip region , nor a nuclear spectrum , and only show the emission line profiles at four distinct locations .",
    "we can compare our results with those of @xcite for the regions in common .",
    "although the width of the  profile around the position of the north - eastern radio hot spot is similar to those observed for h@xmath23 , the   profile does not present any hint of broadening or an additional component at this location relative to the surroundings .",
    "one possibility is that a second component is not detected at   because it is not bright enough , even though it can be detected at h@xmath23 , because h@xmath23 is 6.2 times stronger than  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we observe two - components in the  profile at the locations of the radio hot spots .",
    "the  traces even lower ionization gas than as the ion feii is formed in partially ionized regions , having an ionization potential of only 7.9ev @xcite , while the  line originates from a fully ionized region ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "although many of our results in the near - ir support those by @xcite , a new result we have obtained relative to their study is the observation of the double - component profiles along the se - nw strip , extending by @xmath1300pc and running perpendicularly to the main radio jet .",
    "this structure was not observed by @xcite due to their restricted spatial coverage . @xcite",
    "have suggested that the double components observed perpendicularly to the radio jet ( which is approximately the orientation of the minor axis of the galaxy ) could be interpreted as being originated in a rotating disk by the superposition of two components from opposite sides of the rotation curve which would have been unresolved by their observations .",
    "we note , however , that even at our improved spatial resolution of @xmath120pc , the emission - line profiles of the lines along the se - nw strip are still double .",
    "moreover , they are double not only along the presumed rotation major axis , where a velocity gradient is expected , but also along the presumed kinematic minor axis , where the velocity of a rotation field should be zero .",
    "our data thus do not support the hypothesis the the two components observed along the minor axis of the galaxy are due to unresolved rotation .    in order to better inspect the gas kinematics close to the nucleus",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ 3d ] , a ",
    "tri - dimensional rendering \" of the velocity field : the spatial coordinates @xmath24 define the galaxy plane , and the centroid velocity is plotted as the third coordinate @xmath25 . in this plot",
    "we show only the velocities corresponding to the two components along the se - nw strip and those corresponding to the one - component fits ( excluding the two components associated with the radio hotspots ) .",
    "the velocity field of the one component region ( in green ) seems to delineate a rotation curve , while the blueshifted and redshifted components ( in blue and red , respectively ) of the se - nw strip seem to be detached form the one - component velocity field ( even though the velocities are similar ) , indicating a distinct component .",
    "we have fitted the one - component velocity field using a rotating disk model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the measured velocity field , the best fit rotation model and the residuals are shown in fig .",
    "[ model ] .",
    "the best fit model shows quite a steep rotation curve , and presence of a few high residuals show that the velocity field is only approximately fitted by rotation .        as the gas velocity field rotates in the opposite direction to that of the stars ,",
    "our interpretation is that this gas was captured in the interaction with ngc5930 and is now rotating around the nucleus of ngc5929 but still showing distortions from a  regular \" rotation field due to interaction with the companion .",
    "inflow towards the center of this gas was probably the trigger of the nuclear activity in ngc5929 .",
    "the onset of nuclear activity is associated with outflows originating in the accretion disk , and if a strong  equatorial outflow \" from the accretion disk could be generated , its interaction with the surrounding gas in the galaxy  pushing it outwards  could be the origin of the double component profiles seen along the se - nw strip .",
    "the presence of such an outflow is nevertheless peculiar , as the best mapped outflows in nearby seyfert galaxies are oriented approximately along the radio jet , not perpendicular to it ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    " equatorial \" outflows from accretion disks have been recently proposed by @xcite , being also compatible with a scenario in which the torus surrounding the agn is actually a dusty wind emanating from the outer parts of the accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude that the peculiar velocity field observed in the se - nw strip is thus probably the result of the interaction of an accretion disk equatorial outflow or torus wind with the surrounding gas in the galaxy .    in riffel",
    "( in preparation ) we find that the line ratios suggest the contribution of shocks to the excitation of the  and 2  lines along pa@xmath17 , supporting the presence of an outflow there .",
    "in fact , @xcite presented merlin and vla radio images for ngc5929 at frequencies ranging from 15 to 0.4ghz and resolutions from 005 to 06 .",
    "the radio emission at all frequencies is dominated by the three components seen in the contours of fig .",
    "[ fits ] : the two hotspots plus a nuclear component .",
    "but the 0.4ghz image shows an additional extended emission oriented approximately perpendicular to the line connecting the two hotspots , along pa@xmath26  thus along the se - nw strip .",
    "this extended radio emission has been attributed by @xcite , to a flow of relativistic particles generated by the active nucleus flowing out perpendicularly to the radio jet .",
    "a similar scenario was proposed by @xcite for ngc4151 .",
    "@xcite discuss also an alternative scenario where the extended radio emission originates from starburst driven winds .",
    "this scenario can nevertheless be discarded by our observations since the /  and 2/  ratios are higher than those expected for starbursts ( riffel et al . , in preparation ) .",
    "finally , we have also found double components in the emission - line profiles from regions surrounding the radio hotspots .",
    "we note that one of the components has approximately the velocity of the one - component gas in the surrounding regions , while the other component shows a higher velocity , of up to @xmath1600  around the hotspots , in blueshift to the north - east and in redshift to the south - west .",
    "this indicates that the north - east side of the radio jet is tilted toward us .",
    "we support the interpretation of @xcite that these high velocities are due to the radio jet interacting with the ambient medium , which in this case is the gas in counter rotation , pushing it away from the galaxy nucleus .",
    "we used near - ir integral field spectroscopy of the inner 250  pc of ngc5929 at a spatial resolution of 20  pc and report the discovery of a 50pc wide strip crossing the nucleus perpendicularly to the radio jet ( pa@xmath17 , the se - nw strip ) and extending by 300  pc where the emission lines show two velocity components , one at @xmath27150  and the other at @xmath1 + 150 .",
    "we also show that the extended gas emission perpendicular to the se - nw strip shows only one component , observed in blueshift to the north - east and redshift to the south - west , except around the region of the hotspots , where they are again double .",
    "this apparent rotation pattern is opposite to that of the stellar velocity field .",
    "we have fitted a rotation model to the one component gas and found a steep rotation curve , and residuals as high as 100 , evidencing deviations from simple rotation , which we attribute to the effect of the companion galaxy ngc5930 .",
    "a possible scenario for the complex gas velocity field we have observed is the following : the interaction with ngc5930 has triggered the transfer of gas to the central region of ngc5929 .",
    "the observation that the gas is in counter rotating relative to the stars supports an external origin .",
    "part of this gas reaches the nucleus , where it triggers the nuclear activity , giving rise to the main radio jets which have the north - east side oriented towards us .",
    "the interaction of the radio jet with the rotating gas pushes the rotating gas to projected velocities along the line - of - sight of up to 600 .",
    "the nuclear activity seems also to have produced equatorial outflows along the accretion disk , whose interaction with the surrounding gas  pushing it outwards  originated the double components observed in the emission - line profiles along the se - nw strip .",
    "the presence of such outflows is also supported by the previous observation of faint radio emission perpendicular to the main radio jet .",
    "it is interesting to note also that other recent ifu studies of the central region of active galaxies by our group , such as in @xcite , and in lena et al . _ in preparation _ have also revealed broadened or double emission - line profiles perpendicular to the ionization axis , suggesting that outflows perpendicular to the main axis of the active nucleus may not be a rare phenomenon .",
    "these observations support recent models of equatorial accretion disk winds @xcite and outflowing torus models @xcite .",
