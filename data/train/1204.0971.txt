    "every spherical shell is a neutrino source from scattering the primary flux .",

    "elementary geometry ( see the appendix ) reveals that at distance @xmath53 we expect a scattering flux ( halo ) of @xmath54 for small angles , we find a power law @xmath55 , whereas the large - angle and backward flux depend on the detailed cross - section angular dependence .",
    "in our numerical example , the density outside the shock wave ( at about 70  km ) decreases roughly as @xmath56 out to about 5000  km . with @xmath57",
    "we expect the halo to vary as @xmath58 as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle3 ] .",
    "while it would not provide a good global fit , it looks excellent for about the first decade of angles of the halo .    based on the analytic expression for @xmath59 we can estimate the inward - going flux .",
    "it is very small compared to the outward - going core flux , but its contribution to refraction need not be small .",
    "we consider a region at sufficiently large radius where neutrino - neutrino refraction is dominated by the halo and ask which fraction is caused by inward - going neutrinos , i.e.  which fraction of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : adef ] ) is contributed by @xmath60 .",
    "for sufficiently small power - law index @xmath61 this fraction does not depend on the radius @xmath53 ( to lowest order ) .",
    "coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering is forward peaked and we use @xmath62 .",
    "for @xmath63 the contribution of the backward flux is 25% , for @xmath64 approximately 16% .",
    "all previous studies of collective flavor oscillations of sn neutrinos used the free - streaming approximation : it was assumed that collisions play no role in the relevant stellar region . on the other hand ,",
    "the halo dominates neutrino - neutrino refraction at larger radii , so in some sense the free - streaming assumption gets worse with distance , not better .",
    "therefore , in order to understand collective flavor conversion in this region , one may have to rethink the overall approach  @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", the multiangle matter effect may still suppress the onset of collective flavor conversions , at least in some accretion - phase models .",
    "a linearized stability analysis would still be possible and self - consistent .",
    "if self - induced flavor conversions have not occurred up to some radius and if the matter effect is large in that region , then neutrinos continue to be in weak - interaction eigenstates up to small corrections caused by oscillations with the small in - matter effective mixing angle .",
    "therefore , we can use the core+halo flux at that radius as an inner boundary condition for the subsequent evolution .",
    "in other words , collisions at smaller radii do not change the conceptual approach , they only provide a broader angular distribution than would have existed otherwise .",
    "a greater problem is how to deal with the inward - going flux which , for our conditions , contributes some 20% to neutrino - neutrino refraction .",
    "we will simply neglect it because it can not be incorporated self - consistently in an approach based on outward - only streaming neutrinos .",
    "if the system is stable and stationary , then the picture remains self - consistent because neutrinos remain in flavor eigenstates , including the backward - moving ones .",
    "in this spirit we repeat our linearized flavor stability analysis for our 280  ms snapshot of a @xmath8 accretion - phase model  @xcite in a simplified form .",
    "we model the angular distribution according to our analytic fit , eq .",
    "( [ eq : fit ] ) , which we use at all distances in the form @xmath65 because the curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle1 ] are almost identical up to an angle scaling .",
    "we cut the distribution at @xmath66 to avoid backward - going modes .",
    "we assume monoenergetic neutrinos with @xmath67 for the core flux , i.e.  @xmath68  mev .",
    "we have checked that this choice reproduces well the instability region in fig .  4 of our previous paper  @xcite where the full spectrum was used .",
    "the halo energies are larger as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : energydistribution ] , implying @xmath69 , thus we use monoenergetic halo neutrinos with @xmath70 .",
    "the system is unstable in flavor space if the linearized equation of motion discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite has eigenvalues with imaginary part @xmath71 , the radial growth rate ( in units of km@xmath72 ) of the unstable mode . whether this growth rate is large or small depends on the available distance . in other words , at a given distance @xmath53 , the instability is important if @xmath73 and unimportant if @xmath74 .",
    "therefore , in fig .  [",
    "fig : is_regions ] we show contours of constant @xmath75 in a two - dimensional parameter space consisting of radius @xmath53 of our model and an assumed electron density @xmath76 which causes the multiangle matter effect .",
    "values in the parameter space of radius @xmath53 and assumed electron density @xmath76 .",
    "we use a simplified energy spectrum as described in the text .",
    "the core flux alone is responsible for @xmath73 for @xmath77  km ( blue shading ) , the halo adds the red - shaded region at larger @xmath53 .",
    "we also show the density profile of our 280  ms numerical model.[fig : is_regions ] ]    if we use the core flux alone , this figure contains the same information as fig .  4 in our previous paper  @xcite .",
    "in the absence of matter , the instability would set in at about 150  km , whereas the presence of matter suppresses the instability entirely : the sn density profile never overlaps with the instability region .",
    "the most dangerous region of closest approach is at around 600  km .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : is_regions ] one clearly sees how the halo flux extends the instability region to larger radii ( red shading ) , but only far away from the sn density profile . in other words , the multiangle matter effect strongly suppresses the would - be instability caused by the halo .",
    "this finding does not contradict the importance of the halo flux for neutrino - neutrino refraction .",
    "it is true that the neutrino - neutrino interaction energy caused by the halo was found to decrease roughly as @xmath22 , instead of @xmath23 by the core flux alone .",
    "however , the multiangle matter effect is enhanced in a similar way because it depends on the same neutrino angular distribution .",
    "a more appropriate comparison is between the neutrino and electron densities .",
    "the former decreases as @xmath21 whereas in our model the latter decreases roughly as @xmath56 and thus becomes relatively more important with distance .",
    "therefore , it is no surprise that the multiangle matter effect would be more important with increasing distance .",
    "the halo distribution of neutrinos causes neutrino - neutrino refraction to decrease more slowly with distance than had been thought , but still faster than the matter density during the accretion phase . repeating our linearized stability analysis including the halo , the system remains stable for the chosen example .",
    "as anticipated , the multiangle matter effect is a crucial ingredient for collective flavor conversions especially in those regions where the halo flux is important .",
    "thus it remains possible that self - induced flavor conversions are generically suppressed during the early accretion phase .",
    "the early signal rise would then encode a measurable imprint of the neutrino mass hierarchy  @xcite .    however , more systematic studies are required to understand if such conclusions are generic . for example",
    ", we have assumed that the relatively small backward flux can be neglected for the stability analysis , but its possible role needs to be better understood .",
    "likewise , the role of multi - d effects in sn modeling remains to be explored .",
    "the topic of collective flavor oscillations of sn neutrinos remains a fiendishly complicated problem .",
