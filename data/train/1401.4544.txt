    "binary neutron star ( bns ) mergers represent a leading scenario to generate the physical conditions necessary for the launch of short gamma - ray bursts ( sgrbs ; see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the inspirals and mergers of bnss are promising sources for the detection of gravitational waves ( gws ) with advanced interferometers such as ligo and virgo @xcite that have a predicted rate of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "coincident electromagnetic ( em ) and gw observations are needed to confirm the association of sgrbs with bns mergers and to unravel the physical processes involved . despite observational evidence in some cases ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) and a requirement coming from modeling merger rates @xcite ,",
    "it is not known whether the prompt gamma - ray emission of an sgrb is always collimated in a relativistic jet .",
    "if it was , a large fraction of sgrb events would be missed , as their jets would be beamed away from us .",
    "therefore , understanding the potential em signatures from bns mergers and , in particular , the non - collimated emission ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , is essential .",
    "the _ swift _ satellite @xcite has recently revealed a large subclass of sgrbs that show phases of roughly constant luminosity in their x - ray afterglow lightcurves , referred to as `` extended emission '' and `` x - ray plateaus '' ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "the associated x - ray emission can last from @xmath2 to @xmath3 and the fluence can be comparable to or larger than that of the prompt emission .",
    "these features are taken as a signature of a long - lived central engine as proposed in @xcite , where such emission is assumed to be powered by the magnetic spin - down of a uniformly rotating object formed in a bns merger .",
    "in general , depending on the total mass and mass ratio of the binary , the binary - merger product ( bmp ) can either be a stable neutron star , a supramassive neutron star ( smns , i.e. ,  a star with mass above the maximum mass for nonrotating configurations @xmath4 , but below the maximum mass for uniformly rotating configurations @xmath5 , with @xmath6 ,  @xcite ) , a hypermassive neutron star ( hmns , i.e. ,  a star more massive than a smns ) , or a black hole .    in this letter",
    ", we propose a different scenario to explain the x - ray emission soon after the merger , in which the central engine is a long - lived differentially rotating bmp and , in particular , an hmns .",
    "recent observations of neutron stars with masses as large as @xmath7 @xcite indicate a rather stiff equation of state , while the mass distribution in bnss is peaked around @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this combined evidence suggests that the bmp is almost certainly an smns or an hmns .",
    "on the basis of these considerations and using three - dimensional ( 3d ) general - relativistic ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations , we investigate the em emission of an initially axisymmetric hmns endowed with different initial magnetic fields spanning the range of reasonable configurations . in all cases",
    ", we find a very luminous , quasi - stationary em emission from the hmns , which is associated with a baryon - loaded outflow , driven by magnetic winding in the stellar interior .",
    "the emission , which is compatible with the observed x - ray afterglows , is almost isotropic , though a collimated , mildly relativistic flow can be produced if the magnetic field is mainly oriented along the spin axis .",
    "the isotropic emission is present even in random - field , initial configurations , making it a robust feature of a bns merger and an important em counterpart to the gw signatures .",
    "as a typical hmns , resulting from a bns merger , we consider an axisymmetric initial model constructed using the ` rns ` code @xcite , assuming a polytropic equation of state @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the pressure , @xmath11 the rest - mass density , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . the corresponding maximum gravitational mass for a uniformly rotating ( nonrotating ) model is @xmath14 .",
    "our initial hmns has a mass of @xmath15 , an equatorial radius of @xmath16 , and it is differentially rotating according to a `` @xmath17-constant '' law @xcite , with the differential rotation parameter @xmath18 and central period @xmath19 .    to study the influence of the magnetic field geometry on the em emission , we endow this model in hydrodynamic equilibrium with three different initial magnetic field geometries , which are shown in the left panels of figures  [ fig : evolution_panels_1][fig : evolution_panels_3 ] .",
    "the first model ( hereafter ` dip-60 ` ) employs a dipolar configuration very similar to the one in @xcite and @xcite , specified by the azimuthal component of the vector potential @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the cylindrical radius , @xmath22 , @xmath23 tunes the overall field strength , and @xmath24 indicates the radial location of the magnetic neutral point on the equatorial plane . the second model ( henceforth ` dip-6 ` )",
    "is endowed with the same field geometry , but with @xmath25 .",
    "in contrast to model ` dip-60 ` , where the star is threaded by a magnetic field that is artificially uniform on lengthscales @xmath26 ( cf .",
    "inset in figure  [ fig : evolution_panels_1 ] ) , for model ` dip-6 ` , the neutral point and maximum magnetic field are located in the interior of the star , corresponding to a more realistic distribution of currents .",
    "finally , the third model ( henceforth ` rand ` ) represents a `` random '' magnetic field , which we compute from a vector potential built as the linear superposition of @xmath27 modes with random amplitudes and phases @xmath28 here , @xmath29 label the points on the computational grid , @xmath30 denotes the associated position vectors , and @xmath31 refer to a grid in wave vector @xmath32 space , defined by @xmath33 ^ 3 $ ] , where @xmath34 is the smallest wavelength employed , and @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath36 are random numbers between 0 and 1 . the constant @xmath37 sets the maximum field strength , the factor @xmath38 , with @xmath39 as the determinant of the spatial metric , helps to concentrate stronger magnetic fields in regions of larger space  time curvature , while the denominator scales the magnetic field as @xmath40 for @xmath41 .",
    "we built the random - field model to resemble the actual magnetic field configuration resulting from a bns merger ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in all the above cases ,",
    "@xmath23 and @xmath37 are adjusted to yield maximum initial field strengths of @xmath42 , with the magnetic - to - fluid pressure ratio being @xmath43 inside the star ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : pb_pg ] ) .",
    "the resulting initial magnetic energy @xmath44 differs with the magnetic field geometry , being @xmath45 for models ` dip-60 ` , ` dip-6 ` and ` rand ` , respectively .",
    "the time evolution of these initial data is performed using the publicly available einstein toolkit with the ` mclachlan ` spacetime - evolution code @xcite , combined with the fully general - relativistic ideal - mhd code ` whiskymhd ` @xcite .",
    "the ideal - fluid equation of state @xmath46 is used for the evolution , where @xmath47 is the specific internal energy and @xmath12 .",
    "the star is initially surrounded by a low - density atmosphere with @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the central rest - mass density .",
    "we carry out the mhd computations within the modified lorenz gauge approach @xcite , with damping parameter @xmath50 .",
    "the computational grid consists of a hierarchy of seven nested boxes , extending to @xmath51 in the @xmath52- and @xmath53-directions and to @xmath54 in the @xmath55-direction .",
    "the finest refinement level corresponds to a spatial domain of @xmath56\\times[0,18.4]\\times[0,12.8]\\,\\mathrm{km}$ ] and covers the hmns at all times .",
    "the highest spatial resolution is @xmath57 , but lower - resolution simulations have been performed to check convergence . to make these long - term simulations computationally affordable in 3d and at high resolution , a @xmath58 rotation symmetry around the @xmath55-axis and a reflection symmetry across the @xmath59 plane have been employed .",
    "figures  [ fig : evolution_panels_1][fig : evolution_panels_3 ] show snapshots of the norm of the magnetic field and rest - mass density contours in the @xmath60 plane for the three models discussed above at representative times during the evolution . due to the differential rotation in the hmns , strong toroidal fields",
    "are generated via magnetic winding ( linearly growing at the beginning ) . within a few rotational periods , the build - up of magnetic",
    "pressure ( mostly associated with steep toroidal - field radial gradients ) is sufficient to overcome the gravitational binding in the vicinity of the stellar surface , powering an outflow of highly magnetized low - density matter with mildly relativistic velocities ( cf . also figure  [ fig : pb_pg ] ) .                for model `",
    "dip-60 ` , since the initial magnetic field is oriented along the rotation axis on lengthscales @xmath26 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : evolution_panels_1 ] , left panel ) , the outflow is efficiently channeled along this axis and thus significantly collimated , though this is more the result of the ordered initial magnetic field configuration than of genuine self - confining processes . during the evolution , the non - collimated part of the outflow at lower latitudes tends to push the collimated part toward the axis , effectively shrinking the inner opening angle of this jet - like structure ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : evolution_panels_1 ] ) .",
    "this triggers irregularities in the collimated outflow that manifest themselves as small bubbles of material with low density and magnetization being released along the vertical axis , possibly pointing to a kink instability  @xcite .        the initial magnetic field geometry of ` dip-6 `",
    "has a much smaller curvature scale and is less effective at funneling the outflow ; the resulting collimation is thus much less pronounced than for ` dip-60 ` .",
    "furthermore , while model ` dip-60 ` shows a clear distinction between the collimated and the non - collimated part of the outflow , this is no longer the case for model ` dip-6 ` ( cf .",
    "figures  [ fig : evolution_panels_1 ] and [ fig : evolution_panels_2 ] ) . finally , the model with the most realistic magnetic field configuration , i.e. ,  model ` rand ` , is characterized by an almost isotropic outflow ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : evolution_panels_3 ] ) , though we can not exclude the fact that some form of collimation could emerge at later times .",
    "this represents an important result of our simulations : the amount of collimation in the magnetic - driven wind from the bmp will depend sensitively on the magnetic field geometry and could be absent if the field is randomly distributed .    in all of the configurations considered ,",
    "the magnetized baryon - loaded outflow has rest - mass densities @xmath61 and is ejected from the star with velocities @xmath62 , in the isotropic part , and @xmath63 , in the collimated part .",
    "defining the isotropic luminosity as @xmath64 where @xmath65 is the solid - angle element , @xmath66 is the determinant of the spacetime metric , and @xmath67 is the em part of the energy - momentum tensor , all of the different initial magnetic field geometries yield high , stationary em luminosities associated with the outflow of @xmath68 ( cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : luminosities ] , upper left panel ) .",
    "model ` dip-60 ` has a luminosity that is two orders of magnitude larger than those of models ` dip-6 ` and ` rand ` , which have surprisingly similar luminosities .",
    "these differences can be understood in terms of the different magnetic energies associated with the three models ( see below ) .",
    "we have also verified that when computed at sufficiently large distances , the luminosity depends only weakly on the radius @xmath69 , chosen to compute the integral in equation   ( see figure  [ fig : luminosities ] , lower left panel ) .",
    "the remaining discrepancies among different @xmath69 choices are due to the bulk of the non - collimated part of the outflow having not yet crossed the outer detection spheres at @xmath70 . the effective bulk speed of the outflow at larger distances ( as inferred from the time delay in the onset of @xmath71 at different @xmath69 ) is smaller than the ejection speed of @xmath72 , due to a nonzero atmosphere rest - mass density floor .",
    "this effect is illustrated in the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : luminosities ] , where a lower floor yields a higher bulk speed ( cf .",
    "black and red lines ) .",
    "note , however , that the stationary luminosity is not affected by the atmosphere level even when the latter is changed by one order of magnitude .",
    "furthermore , the lower right panel of figure  [ fig : luminosities ] reports the luminosity for three different resolutions , showing that the outflow speed is affected but the stationary levels are in reasonably good agreement .",
    "another important conclusion to be drawn from our simulations is that , keeping the background fluid model fixed , the em luminosity essentially depends on the initial magnetic energy of the system . in this way , the difference of two orders of magnitude between the luminosities of model ` dip-60 ` and those of models ` dip-6 ` and ` rand ` ( cf .",
    "upper left panel of figure  [ fig : luminosities ] ) is simply due to the corresponding difference in @xmath44 .",
    "this is demonstrated in the upper right panel of figure  [ fig : luminosities ] , where we show the luminosity of a model ` dip-60 ` with an initial magnetic field strength that is rescaled to match the initial magnetic energy of model ` dip-6 ` . once the initial magnetic energies coincide , the resulting stationary luminosities are the same and therefore independent of the magnetic field geometry and degree of collimation .",
    "our results lead to a simple expression for the em luminosity from the bmp , @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the ( central ) spin period and @xmath75 denotes the initial maximum magnetic field .",
    "our simulations reveal the need for a fudge factor , @xmath76 , that is @xmath77 for the more realistic magnetic field configurations ` rand ` and ` dip-6 ` , and @xmath78 for ` dip-60 ` , showing that initial models with the same @xmath75 but different field geometries lead to luminosities that differ by orders of magnitude ( cf .  upper left panel of figure  [ fig : luminosities ] ) .",
    "the role of the equatorial radius , @xmath79 , is to define the volume in which the conversion of rotational energy into em energy occurs , while the period , @xmath74 , sets the timescale of such conversion .",
    "0.5 cm     equation   still holds if expressed in terms of quantities referring to the stage when the outflow has become roughly stationary , by substituting @xmath80 with @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the magnetic field strength reached in the outer layers of the star ( @xmath79 and @xmath74 are essentially unchanged from @xmath83 ) .",
    "the fudge factor is no longer necessary , as this new expression does not depend on the magnetic field geometry .",
    "two remarks should be made .",
    "first , scalings similar to equation   have already been reported in the literature ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) , where , however , no discussion was made on the dependence of the luminosity on the initial magnetic field geometry and thus on the importance of the factor @xmath76 .",
    "ignoring this dependence can easily lead to over / underestimates of the luminosity by orders of magnitude .",
    "second , the scaling with radius and period in equation   are very different from those resulting from the magnetic dipole spin - down emission considered in the model of @xcite , where the luminosity is given by @xmath84 . these differences in scaling may be used to discriminate between the scenario proposed here and that by @xcite .",
    "defining the conversion efficiency of em luminosity into observed x - ray luminosity as @xmath85 , we can use the results of our simulations for characteristic radii and periods ( @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) to deduce that magnetic field strengths in the range @xmath88 are needed to produce luminosities @xmath89 , which characterize the extended emission and x - ray plateaus of sgrbs ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) . assuming an efficiency of , e.g. , @xmath90 yields magnetic field strengths @xmath91 .",
    "these strengths are not reached in the progenitor neutron stars , but they can be built from much weaker initial magnetic fields in a number of ways : the compression of stellar cores @xcite , the kelvin  helmholtz instability developing during the merger ( @xcite ) , magnetic winding and the magnetorotational instability ( mri ; @xcite ) . in particular , the mri might enhance the em emission , though its saturation level is unknown and its role in determining luminosity levels remains unclear .",
    "unfortunately , resolving the mri in long - term global simulations is out of reach . in our simulations only magnetic winding is at play , yet magnetic fields are amplified by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "the timescale for the persistence of differential rotation and the survival time of the bmp is still very much uncertain @xcite and it is hard to estimate the timescale @xmath92 over which these luminosities can be sustained .",
    "simulations show that the timescale for the extraction of angular momentum via gws from a bar - deformed bmp is @xmath93 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; but see also @xcite ) . hence ,",
    "if the bmp survives for more than @xmath94 , it must have been driven toward an almost axisymmetric equilibrium by gw emission .",
    "a back of the envelope estimate of magnetic braking leads to a timescale of @xmath95  s for the magnetic fields considered here @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed by the evolution of the angular velocity in our simulations , which shows that @xmath96  s in the stellar interior . both of these timescales should be meant as lower limits and differential rotation will be removed on timescales that could be 10 times larger .",
    "however , even 100 s are not sufficient to explain x - ray luminosities lasting @xmath97 s. a viable scenario is one in which the bmp is an hmns at birth , but evolves into an smns while differential rotation is removed via magnetic braking and rest mass is lost via the wind ( our simulations show mass - loss rates of @xmath98s@xmath99 ) . in this case , the bmp can survive on much longer timescales as it needs less angular momentum to prevent gravitational collapse . once differential rotation has been removed ( or is very small )",
    ", the spin - down via dipolar emission through the global magnetic field produced over these timescales would power the em emission @xcite .",
    "note that a similar evolution also applies if the differentially rotating bmp is an smns at birth .    considering a reference luminosity of @xmath100 ,",
    "the timescale needed to exhaust the reservoir of rotational energy @xmath101 of our bmp is readily given by @xmath102 .",
    "through fitting the data reported in table 3 of @xcite we find a power - law correlation between the observed plateau luminosities and durations : @xmath103\\sim10^{52}\\,(\\tau_{_{\\mathrm{em}}}\\,[\\mathrm{s}])^{-a}$ ] , where @xmath104 .",
    "given a luminosity of @xmath105 , the fit gives a duration of the plateau emission @xmath106 for @xmath107 .",
    "it is reassuring that even these crude estimates provide emission timescales that are well below the upper limit of @xmath108 , thus showing the compatibility with the observations .",
    "we also note that the estimates made above are based on the assumption that the observed emission is essentially isotropic",
    ". if there is collimation within a solid angle @xmath109 , the duration @xmath92 estimated from the fit would be reduced by a factor of @xmath110 .",
    "using ideal mhd simulations we have investigated the em emission of an initially axisymmetric hmns endowed with different initial magnetic field configurations , spanning the range of geometries expected from bns mergers . despite the different initial configurations , we have found that , in all cases , differential rotation in the hmns generates a strong toroidal magnetic field and a consequent baryon - loaded outflow with bulk velocities @xmath72 .",
    "this emission is almost isotropic , though an additional collimated , mildly relativistic flow is produced if the initial magnetic field has a dominant dipole component along the spin axis .",
    "since the emission we observe emerges as a robust feature of a bns merger and given the consistency of the luminosity levels and duration with the observations , we conclude that the proposed physical mechanism represents a viable explanation for the x - ray afterglows of sgrbs .",
