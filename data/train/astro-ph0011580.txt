    "there are now five bursts with evidence for large amounts of material around the site of the explosion : four ( grb 970508 , piro et al . , 1999 ;",
    "grb 970828 , yoshida et al . , 1999 ; grb 991216 , piro et al . , 2000 , hereafter p2000 ; grb 000214 , antonelli et al . , 2000 )",
    "show an emission feature during the afterglow , and one ( grb 990705 , amati et al . , 2000 )",
    "displays an edge in absorption during the burst itself .",
    "the observations of grb 991216 by @xmath0 , begun 37  hr after the burst and lasting for about 3 hr , show a 3.49@xmath50.06 kev line significant at a @xmath6 level .",
    "if the line is identified with the recombination k@xmath7 line from h  like iron ( 6.97 kev ) , the inferred redshift is @xmath8 consistent with the largest optical absorption redshift system ( @xmath9 ) ( vreeswijk et al . , 2000 ) .",
    "the line , resolved by @xmath0 , displays a width corresponding to @xmath10 ( p2000 ) . the line and the 210 kev continuum fluxes were @xmath11 and @xmath12 erg s@xmath13 @xmath14 , respectively , implying ( for @xmath15 ) an emission rate of iron line photons of @xmath16 s@xmath13 , luminosity @xmath17 erg s@xmath13 and total energy @xmath18 erg ( assuming steady emission for @xmath19  hr , with @xmath20 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 and @xmath21 ) . if each iron atom produces @xmath22 line photons , the required iron mass is @xmath23   m@xmath24 . bringing this mass down to @xmath25  m@xmath24 implies @xmath26 which in turn implies a limit on the recombination time   s in the temperature range @xmath27k . ] .",
    "this translates into the condition @xmath28 @xmath29 ; the electron temperature @xmath30 k comes from interpreting the broad bump , marginally detected by @xmath0 , at 4.4@xmath50.5 kev as the recombination continuum of h  like iron ( 9.28 kev ) .",
    "analogously to grb  950708 ( lazzati et al .",
    "1999 ) , the line detection implies the presence of @xmath31 of pure iron in the vicinity of the burster .    observation of the line @xmath32 after the burst implies that the line emitting material must be within @xmath33 from the burst site : this region must then be _ compact _ , contain @xmath34 only in iron , but nevertheless be optically thin to electron scattering , such that comptonization does not broaden the line beyond the observed width .",
    "we call this the _ size problem_.    furthermore , if we interpret the line width as due to the velocity of a supernova remnant , the limit on the size allows to estimate the age of the remnant : for grb 991216 , @xmath35  days . at this time ( fig .",
    "1 ) , cobalt nuclei outnumber nickel and iron nuclei and the line would be produced mainly by cobalt , not iron , at an energy @xmath36 kev .",
    "we call this the _",
    "kinematic problem_.    we discuss in section 2 the constraints implied by the line observation ; we then present in section 3 three scenarios which could produce the observed line .",
    "two of them are found to be viable only by adopting ad hoc assumptions or through fine tuning , while a third scenario , the  wide funnel \" scenario , appears to be more promising . in section 4",
    "we discuss our results .",
    "the detection of emission features in the afterglow spectra of grbs some hours after the grb event poses a strong constraint on the location of the line emitting material .",
    "if the line is detected after @xmath32 from the burst explosion the material must be located within a distance @xmath37 given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the angle between the line emitting material and the line of sight at the grb site .",
    "this limit has important implications , because the scattering optical depth is large , @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 , 1.2 and 2 for pure hydrogen , solar composition , and no hydrogen , respectively ) , and , for a remnant radial velocity of @xmath42 cm s@xmath13 the time elapsed from the sn is @xmath43 $ ] days , implying that most @xmath44co nuclei ( and a fraction of @xmath44ni ) have not yet decayed to @xmath44fe ( half  lives of 77.3 and 6.08 days , respectively ) . in fig .",
    "1 we show normalized abundances of nickel , cobalt and iron as a function of time from the sn explosion .    to produce the line by frequent recombinations and ionizations , a sufficiently high ionizing flux and a large number of h  like iron ions , fexxvi , are required .",
    "efficient use of these ions requires that the photoionization optical depth for fexxvi , @xmath45 . using photoionization cross section @xmath46 @xmath14 , and abundance ratio @xmath47",
    ", we have @xmath48 a strict _ lower _ limit on the ionizing continuum power comes from the line flux itself . for grb 991216 , for which there is no _ rebursting _ in the x  ray afterglow ( contrary to grb 970508 ) , assuming an illumination time of 20 hr , we require @xmath49 erg . even in the case of an illuminating continuum not directly visible by us , we require that the scattered flux produced by the line emitting material does not affect the afterglow emission , i.e. it must contribute less than 10@xmath50 erg @xmath14 s@xmath13 to the observed flux , giving the _ upper _ limit @xmath51 erg .      if the emitting atoms are diluted in an electron cloud , the fraction of unscattered flux @xmath52/\\tau_{\\rm t}$ ] , while if the scattering cloud surrounds a central source the fraction @xmath53 .",
    "if the scattering electrons have a temperature in the @xmath54  k range ( according to the indication that the recombination continuum observed in grb991216 may be broad , p2000 ) , the average energy shift of line photons scattered only once is @xmath55 ( pozdnyakov , sobol & sunyaev 1983 ) , _ already broader than the observed line width_. multiple scatterings would further broaden the line , making it increasingly difficult to detect against the x  ray continuum . if the line of grb 991216 were made by photons escaping unscattered from a medium with @xmath56 , the problem with the line flux would be exacerbated , a factor @xmath57 more iron being required .",
    "an alternative possibility , that the electron temperature @xmath58  k , say @xmath59 k expected if the ionizing continuum were steep and extended to low energies , might conjure with a suitable value of @xmath57 to yield , through compton broadening , the observed line width . in this case",
    ", however , the centroid of the line would be redshifted ( line photons are mostly backscattered by colder electrons ) and the recombination continuum narrower . due to poor statistics , the recombination continuum of grb 991216 can not place a firm constraint on the electron temperature , but the models in section 3 are largely independent of the presence and width of the recombination emission continuum .",
    "we can roughly divide the models into _ transmission _ and _ reflection _ models .",
    "if we see the line in reflection , line photons come from the layer with @xmath60  several . for an iron abundance greater than the solar value , in this layer @xmath61 . in general ,",
    "transmission models require @xmath62 and @xmath63 , while reflection models require @xmath64 .",
    "each iron atom must produce @xmath65 iron photons , and this requires an electron density larger than @xmath66 @xmath29 .",
    "the large equivalent widths of the x  ray line in grb 991216 ( @xmath67 kev ) and , especially , grb 970508 ( @xmath68 kev ) , grb 970828 ( @xmath69 kev ) and grb 000214 ( @xmath70 kev ) favor models in which the line originates in reflection , not transmission . in reflection , in fact",
    ", the ionizing flux is always efficiently reprocessed in line photons in the @xmath71 layer , while in transmission this happens only for a particular tuning of the fexxvi and the free electron densities .",
    "three alternative geometries ( fig .",
    "2 ) producing lines in reflection are described below .    in reflection models",
    ", we can derive the photon line luminosity by estimating the volume @xmath72 effectively contributing to the line emission , and assuming a given iron mass . if the layer contributing to the emission has @xmath73 ( in order to avoid excessive compton broadening of the line ) , and in this layer @xmath74a few ( to efficiently absorb the continuum ) , we have @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the emitting surface . the line emission rate from @xmath72",
    "is then @xmath77 where we assumed that the _ total _ volume is @xmath78 ( slab or shell geometry ) .",
    "[ eq : ndot ] shows that the total iron mass must be a sizable fraction of a solar mass to obtain the observed line flux ( @xmath79  s@xmath13 ) , but less than the largest observed values , @xmath80 for sn 1998bw ( type ic , sollerman et al . , 2000 ) and sn1991 t , ( type ia , filippenko et al . , 1992 )",
    "[ rate ] all by itself establishes that the line emitting material must be a snr : no other known astrophysical object contains so much iron , not even the largest known stars ( though these fail by a factor of a few only ) .",
    "[ eq : ndot ] has another important implication : it fixes @xmath81 , and since @xmath37 is fixed ( for a given geometry , see below ) by the time ",
    "delay , the cloud density is also fixed , to within an order of magnitude .",
    "solutions with densities much exceeding ( or much below ) @xmath82 @xmath29 are excluded .",
    "if the grb explodes within the young remnant of a supernova , we must consider two possibilities : a plerionic and a shell remnant .",
    "in the first case , we consider a wide funnel excavated in a young plerionic remnant .",
    "this can solve the _ size problem _",
    ", since it extends to large radii but , at the same time ( eq .  [ eq : rag ] ) , can maintain the time ",
    "delay contained because it is naturally built close to the polar axis ( assumed close to the line of sight ) .",
    "the geometry is sketched in fig .",
    "2a . fixing the line photons rate ( eq . [ rate ] ) yields @xmath83 cm , and thus an opening angle @xmath84 , to fit the time  delay . for any reasonable sn composition , these parameters imply @xmath85  @xmath29 .",
    "the funnel walls are probably not straight ( like in a cone geometry ) , but curved instead , like the surface of the coffee in a cup when it is spun up , and can be illuminated by the ionizing flux from a central source . assuming a cone geometry for simplicity , we rewrite equation  [ eq : ndot ] as @xmath86 where in this case @xmath37 ( the radius of the filled remnant ) has been used instead of @xmath87 and @xmath88 takes into account the geometry of the funnel .",
    "this is a lower limit , since a parabolic geometry has a larger funnel surface and we neglected the ( likely ) density stratification inside the remnant .",
    "since the funnel s normal is _ not _ parallel to the incident photon s momentum , radiation pressure exerts a force parallel to the surface on the layer @xmath89 ( which reflects isotropically photons arriving from a specific direction ) .",
    "calling @xmath90 the angle between the funnel s normal and the incident photon s arrival direction the absorbed fluence @xmath91 accelerates the funnel layer to a speed @xmath92  km  s@xmath13 when @xmath93  cm .",
    "thus , ablation by radiation pressure propels the reflecting layer to velocities like those seen in grb991216 by p2000 .",
    "the funnel model can thus explain the observed line broadening even in a relatively old snr .",
    "for a remnant with @xmath94  km  s@xmath13 , a typical value for type ii sne , we find a remnant age @xmath95  days , enough to turn most @xmath44ni and @xmath44co into @xmath44fe ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the emitting iron is then boosted to higher velocity by the ionizing flux , circumventing the kinematical problem .",
    "we consider now a shell remnant , characterized by a wide opening , so that a substantial fraction of its inner face is visible ( fig .",
    "2b ) , and illuminated by burst and afterglow and , more likely , by the shock due to the fireball impact ( bttcher 2000 ) .",
    "line photons are produced in the layer @xmath96  few .",
    "as before , the remnant may have been expanding slowly , until accelerated by burst photons . since we see the remnant s internal part , the _ size _ limit discussed in section 2 is tighter , and we detect mainly redshifted photons . for a remnant distance @xmath97 cm and velocity 5,000 km s@xmath13 ,",
    "the age is @xmath98  days , close to the @xmath44co peak ( fig .",
    "1 ) . however , the 7.5 kev @xmath44co line would be observed with a substantial redshift ( and therefore mimic a @xmath44fe 6.97 kev line ) , if the burst photons increased the expanding velocity to @xmath99  km  s@xmath13 ( implying that the burst emitted a few times @xmath100  erg sideways , for a 10 @xmath101 remnant ) . in this model the observed line width of 15,000 km s@xmath13 requires that only a limited range of projections of the radial expansion velocity vectors are observed .",
    "this solution is not convincing since it involves fine tuning between the energy produced sideways and the mass of the remnant , in order to have the correct expansion velocity , even though it explains naturally the different centroid energy of the line observed in grb  970508 : since the line is redshifted by shell expansion , we expect a distribution of observed energies as a consequence of different velocities of the remnant .",
    "we now explore the possibility of a simultaneous grbsupernova \" explosion .",
    "consider a scenario in which the grb ejects and accelerates a small amount of matter in a collimated cone , while a large amount of matter is instead ejected , at sub ",
    "relativistic speeds , along the progenitor s equator . for illustration , assume equal amounts of energy , @xmath100 erg , in both directions , and 1  m@xmath102 expelled along the equator",
    ". then @xmath103 .",
    "massive star progenitors are always surrounded by dense material from strong winds with mass loss rates @xmath104 and velocity @xmath105 .",
    "this wind scatters back a fraction of the photons produced by the bursts and its afterglow ( thompson & madau 2000 ) , , nd , in return it is also accelerated until it reaches relativistic velocities , when scattering efficiency decreases .",
    "thus assume that each electron ( and the associated proton ) scatters photons only until it reaches @xmath106 , i.e. until it has scattered a total energy of @xmath107 ( i.e. @xmath1082,000 photons of 0.5 mev each ) . in this case",
    "the scattered luminosity @xmath109 is constant , since there are an equal number of electrons in a shell of constant width @xmath87 ( for a density profile @xmath110 ) .",
    "this luminosity is of the order : @xmath111 scattered photons illuminate the expanding equatorial matter after a time @xmath112 , producing x  ray line emission mostly due to k@xmath7 emission from h  like @xmath44ni at 8.1 kev .",
    "even if the large expanding velocity makes the transverse doppler shift important , this requires a fine tuned velocity to redshift the 8.1 kev @xmath44ni line into 6.97 kev , for which reason we consider this scenario unlikely .",
    "x  ray line emission features from grbs afterglows give us information on the nature of their progenitors by imposing constraints on models , the most severe being how to arrange a large amount of line emitting material around the grb site , but without large thomson scattering opacities .",
    "a further limit comes from the line width of @xmath0 s observation in grb 991216 .",
    "these observations require a large iron mass ( eq . [ rate ] ) , such as is seen only in sne .",
    "we have presented three distinct models : two ( the  back of the remnant \" and  back illuminated equatorial material \" models ) require that the observed emission line is produced by redshifted cobalt or nickel ( instead of iron ) , and need fine tuning and/or ad hoc assumptions .",
    "the  wide funnel \" model , instead , solves the size problem , and the acceleration of the line emitting material by grazing incident photons solves the kinematic problem , allowing time for cobalt to decay to iron .",
    "it implies that the grb progenitors are massive stars exploded as supernovae months before the burst , contaminating the circum ",
    "burst environment with iron rich material .",
    "this two  step process , and the time  delay between the two steps , are predicted by the supranova scenario ( vietri & stella , 1998 ) .",
    "alternative explanations invoke extremely iron enriched massive winds ( weth et al . 2000 ) .",
    "future observations may address issues such as the presence of cobalt and nickel lines in the spectrum , the age of the remnant , the line profile , the geometry and kinematics of the emitting region , the presence of more than one line , the ionization state , the time evolution of the line and edges , all indicative of the characteristics of the illuminator .",
    "together , this information may determine whether the line emitting material originates in a normal , albeit rare , supernova remnant or if a more exotic explosive phenomenon is required .",
