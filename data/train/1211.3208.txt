    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) and x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) share many properties , but broad emission lines ( bels ) are not among them .",

    "the possibility of a threshold mass for strong bel production has become interesting from recent observational results , which seem to suggest that there are no broad line emitting black holes below @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "is this because there are no such black holes , or is it that , even when accreting at substantial rates , such black holes can not produce bels with detectable ews ?",
    "most existing photoionization calculations for the broad emission lines in agn , study the line strengths as a function of the overall shape of the ionizing continuum @xcite and the luminosity of the agn .",
    "however , mostly , these studies do not take the further step of directly relating the emission line properties to @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "on the other hand , dynamical measurements of @xmath9 , from the widths of the broad lines , and/or using the reverberation mapping techniques , @xcite consider an average @xmath11 relationship and do not need to delve into the details of the line strengths and ratios . in this study",
    "we shall use the loc model , where the broad lines are due to locally , optimally emitting clouds , first suggested by @xcite .",

    "* hereafter ss73 ) .",
    "the temperature of the annulus at radius @xmath14 is @xmath15 @xcite where @xmath10 is the accretion rate of the central black hole of mass @xmath9 , @xmath16 is its eddington accretion rate and @xmath17 is the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath18 is the gravitational constant and @xmath19 is the velocity light ) .",

    "agn are often selected from large databases like sloan digital sky survey ( hereafter sdss ) based on their broadband optical colours , which depend on the intrinsic sed of the agn . from",
    "we see that all of the five sdss filters ( u-3551 , g-4686 , r-6165 , i-7481 and z-8931  ) are positioned on the linear , same slope ` low energy ' tail of the intrinsic agn seds so that they can not be distinguished as black holes of different mass , merely from studying the sdss colours .",
    "sdss , however observes the redshifted and not the intrinsic seds of the quasars .",
    "even when seeing the redshifted sed , there is no effect of the mass on the sdss colors for @xmath33 for @xmath34    even if the colour selection algorithms of sdss are not biased against detecting the lower mass black holes , they will still drop out because the intrinsic luminosity of the agn decreases with the mass of the black hole .",
    "for example , based on the flux limits of the sdss filters @xcite , the @xmath35 black holes drop out beyond a redshift @xmath36 , whereas a @xmath37 black hole can be seen for @xmath38 .",
    "note that the aforementioned redshift limits are based on the continuum flux only .",
    "agn are however detected primarily through the detection of their emission lines .",
    "the limits based on the emission lines would be different and we shall discuss this further in .",
    "@xcite and @xcite show that , for a given sed , any particular emission line is dominated by emission from a fairly narrow range of gas density ( @xmath39 ) and incident flux @xmath40 [ @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the number of hydrogen ionizing photons and @xmath14 is the distance of the cloud from the source of the ionizing radiation ] .",

    "@xcite discuss both the successes and limitations of the loc model . among limitations they mention that ( a ) some of the parameters of the model like the indices of the density and radial distribution of the clouds can not be physically interpreted and ( b ) the model does not include some physical effects like self - shielding .",

    "deviations ( of any contour ) from the 45@xmath53 lines show where thermal heating of the gas begins to be more important than photoionization , usually at high @xmath39 and high @xmath40 ( upper right , each panel ) .",
    "for example , taking the example of the @xmath66 contour for @xmath67 , we see that it ` turns over ' from high @xmath68 and becomes diagonal again at a lower @xmath69 .",

    "however , the high ionization ridge ( upper - left ) is pushed to lower @xmath71 , e.g by 1.23 dex for the @xmath65 sed .",
    "thus for any given sed , lower column density restricts efficient line production to a tighter range of @xmath71 .    to assess the contribution from all the clouds of different density and column density and at different distances",

    "1 .   additional components of the agn sed : + both the agn ( super - massive black holes ) and the xrbs ( solar mass black holes ) are powered by the active matter accretion into the black hole . however , the emission from the accretion disk is not the only component of the observed sed from the agn or the xrbs . in both cases",
    "we also observe power - law emission at higher energies ( @xmath126 for agn and @xmath127 for xrbs ) .",
    "the power - law is thought to be due to inverse comptonisation of some of the disk photons by the hot coronal plasma surrounding the black hole , or due to the jet ( particularly for xrbs ) . in case of agn of type 1",
    ", sometimes we see an additional component , the soft - excess at @xmath128 , which may be comptonized disk emission or an entirely separate component altogether .",
    "often the soft excess can be modeled as a blackbody of temperature @xmath129 .",
    "however , for all the calculations presented in this paper , we ignore the power - law and the soft - excess components of the sed , because their shape or strength are independent of the mass of the black hole .",
    "+ the strengths of the lines are determined by the available number of photons close to the ionization potential ( ip ) of the relevant ions . in this paper",
    "we have restricted our studies to black holes with @xmath130 because it was sufficient to consider only the mass dependent accretion disk component of the sed . in this mass range ,",
    "the accretion disk is hot enough that the energy ranges of the ionization or excitation potentials ( @xmath131 ) required to produce the lines @xmath94 , @xmath4 and @xmath12 are dominated by the disk emission and the power - law or the soft excess would contribute less than 1% of the radiation from the accretion disk .",

    "these points lie exactly on the line for the @xmath77 distribution , generated using only the accretion disk component , showing that the addition of the power - law and the soft - excess component is redundant for these emission lines in the black hole mass range considered .",
    "+ however , while considering similar studies for higher mass black holes , one has to carefully account for the other aforementioned components of the agn sed because , the high energy tail of the accretion disk sed for @xmath135 may cut - off at less than @xmath136 .",
    "+ similar considerations are required for constructing the agn sed required to correctly predict the @xmath77 for @xmath137 , which is an important bel in the uv .",
    "the ip of ov is 113.90 ev , an energy range dominated by the power - law for quasar - like ( @xmath138 ) sed .",
    "thus @xmath77 calculations for ovi would require an agn sed including all the components , and not just the accretion disk emission .",
    "we will study such emission lines in details in our future publications .",
    "alternative models for the accretion disk : + instead of a radiatively efficient thin accretion disk ( bbb , due to * ? ? ?",
    "* , ss73 ) , sometimes black holes might have advection dominated , radiatively inefficient accretion flows , which would result in significantly different seds ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that the ss73 models ( considered in this paper ) .",
    "these alternative prescriptions drastically change the shape of the sed in the energy range of the ip of the ions responsible for the bels and the narrow emission lines ( nels ) .",
    "we intend to calculate the line strengths due to such ionizing seds and predict observable signatures , which might act as diagnostic tools .",
    "+ even for the bbb , more rigorous models exist for modeling the radiation from the accretion disk ( bbb ) .",
    "for example , @xcite discuss the role of real radiative transfer in the accretion disc .",
    "the spin of the black hole is another physical parameter parameter to be considered @xcite . qualitatively speaking ,",
    "for the same black hole mass and accretion rate , these models push the peak of the sed to higher energies than due to the ss73 model .",
    "we would like to calculate line strengths corresponding to these models and test if the observations of bels and nels are sensitive enough to differentiate these accretion disk models from bbb .",
    "3 .   comparison with data : + we intend to use the sdss data base for @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath12 and the hst and/or fuse data base for @xmath137 , to compare our predicted @xmath77 and line ratios with the observed line strengths .",
    "we would hope to draw constraints on other physical parameters ( e.g. distance of the belr ) by such comparisons .",
    "eventually we would want to extend our theoretical analysis to include other fundamental black hole parameters like the accretion rate .",
    "we would like to test if such systematic loc modeling can explain observed effects like the `` balwin effect '' @xcite , where the equivalent width of the civ emission line decreases with increasing continuum luminosity .",
    "4 .   narrow emission lines :",
    "+ we intend to do similar studies for the nels in the agn spectrum",
    ". it would be interesting to see if they also show a mass dependence of the @xmath77 , given that the nel clouds are further away from the black hole and may be outside its sphere of influence ( fwhm for nel 1/6 of that for bels ) and/or their sizes are not governed by keplerian dynamics .",
    "1 .   we wanted to investigate",
    "if there is a lower mass cut - off below which black holes can not produce the broad emission lines ( bels ) like @xmath139 , @xmath4 and @xmath12 typically used to detect and identify agn activity from large optical data bases like the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "using the standard loc ( locally optically emitting clouds ) model for the broad emission line region ( belr ) without any restrictions on the radius on its radius , photoionization calculations show an unobserved rise in the equivalent widths ( @xmath77s ) of the lines with decreasing mass .",
    "3 .   however , introducing a cut - off radius for the belr produces sharp mass dependent drops in the @xmath77s , when the cut - off radius is determined from simple keplerian mechanics , depending on the mass of the black hole ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "such drops are consistent with the observations including that below @xmath140 the above mentioned emission lines are not observed .",
    "our findings conclude that these observations may not indicate the absence of black holes of such low mass , but the inability of such black holes to produce the observable ( with our detectors ) line strengths .",
    "such a conclusion might have consequences for modifying the black hole mass function in the lower mass end .",
    "however , before we can attempt to address such issues , we need to carry out a more rigorous systematic study ( listed above , in ) of the @xmath77 of bels and nels , as a function of other fundamental black hole parameters like its accretion rate and alternative accretion theory models .",
