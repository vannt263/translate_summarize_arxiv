    "the ions typically equilibrate with @xmath49k , which gives @xmath50 , so the ions are strongly coupled .",

    "it is interesting to note that under usual conditions in weakly interacting plasmas or even atomic gases , the time scale for relaxation of the two - particle distribution function , which describes correlations , is much faster than the collision time that governs the relaxation of the one - particle distribution function to the maxwell - boltzmann form .",

    "the force leads to an average radial expansion velocity for the ions , @xmath60 the velocity is correlated with position and increases linearly with time .",

    "thermalization of ions and electrons @xcite is slow and occurs on a millisecond time scale .    equation [ ionvelocity ] for the average ion velocity assumes a constant electron temperature .",
    "actually , as the plasma expands , electrons will cool .",
