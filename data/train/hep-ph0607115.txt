    "the value of the ckm matrix element @xmath0 , related to the top - bottom charged current , is often considered to be known to a very satisfactory precision ( @xmath2 at 90% c.l .",
    "however , this range is determined using a full set of tree - level processes and relies on the unitarity of the @xmath3 ckm matrix .",
    "the unitary assumption is mainly supported by three experimental facts :    1 .",
    "the measurement of @xmath4 and @xmath5 in @xmath6 mesons decays .",
    "we now know that the hierarchy of the elements belonging to the first two rows of the ckm matrix is in excellent agreement with the unitary condition .",
    "this is particularly evident within the wolfenstein s parametrization in terms of @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the cabibbo angle .",
    "2 .   the recent d  and cdf results on @xmath9  @xcite : 17  ^-1 < m_b_s < 21   ^-1 & & + 17.33^+0.42_-0.21(stat.)0.07(syst . )   ^-1  & & .",
    "the rather precise cdf measurement allows us to extract the ratio @xmath10 0.20 < |v_td / v_ts| < 0.22 , [ eq : vtdvts ] by using @xmath11 ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite ) and taking into account the theoretical uncertainty associated with the hadronic matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "this ratio fits well with the unitary hypothesis which predicts it to be of order @xmath12 .",
    "one should emphasize however , that these processes come from loop diagrams , and could be polluted by new physics contributions .",
    "3 .   the tevatron measurements of @xmath13 based on the relative number of @xmath14-like events with zero , one and two tagged @xmath15-jets .",
    "the resulting values for @xmath13 are @xmath16  @xcite and @xmath17 @xcite for cdf and d  respectively , both giving @xmath18 at 95% confidence level . recalling the definition",
    "@xmath19 it is clear that @xmath20 implies a strong hierarchy between @xmath0 and the other two matrix elements , as expected in the unitary case .",
    "as we will argue later on , the upper limits of the single top production cross sections from tevatron might already provide ( rather loose ) additional constraints on their absolute magnitude , @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "on the other hand , contrary to what has sometimes been argued , none of these experimental facts are _ directly _ constraining @xmath0 .",
    "in fact , even its `` direct '' determination from @xmath13 , giving @xmath23 at 95% c.l . , comes simply from taking the square root of @xmath13 , assuming the unitarity of the ckm matrix .",
    "since no single top cross section measurement yet exists , the @xmath24 alternative should be considered as still acceptable .",
    "this possibility appears , for example , if one introduces new heavy up- and/or down - type quarks .",
    "though such new fermions are not favoured by current precision constraints , they are not yet excluded , and their existence is in fact predicted by many extensions of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite .",
    "we should thus keep in mind that the familiar @xmath3 ckm matrix might well be a submatrix of a @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 or even larger matrix .    in the following section , we present two minimal extensions of the sm that allow a value for @xmath0 considerably different from one .",
    "although these models are theoretically self - consistent , they should be primarily regarded as motivations for further experimental scrutiny of @xmath0 . in the first case",
    ", the introduction of a new vector - like top singlet leads to a global rescaling of @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath0 leaving @xmath13 unchanged . in the second case ,",
    "a complete new fourth generation is added and the @xmath13 measurement is used as a direct constraint . in section 3 , we discuss the expected precision on the extraction of @xmath0 at the lhc from the measurement of the single top production cross sections .",
    "finally , we review some aspects of direct @xmath30 search at the lhc and in particular the possibility of distinguishing a vector - like @xmath31 singlet top from that of a fourth generation .",
    "as discussed in the introduction , a ratio @xmath13 close to one does not necessarily require @xmath0 to be close to one .",
    "indeed , as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : rdef ] ) , this ratio is invariant under a simple rescaling of all @xmath34 entries : v_ti = v_ti^(0 ) .",
    "the minimal way to implement such a rescaling within the so successful renormalizable @xmath35 electroweak theory is to introduce one @xmath36 vector - like quark .",
    "if this hypothetical iso - singlet quark also has a mass around the electroweak scale , it naturally mixes with its nearest neighbour , _",
    "i.e. _ , the standard heavy top , to enlarge the unitary ckm matrix @xmath37 : _ 43= (    cc * 1*_22 & 0 + 0 & * u*_22    ) (    c * v*_33^(0 ) + 0    ) ; ^_44 , [ eq:6 ] where @xmath38 enters in the flavor changing charged current _ w^()=-[|u_l * v * ^d_lw_^+ + h.c . ] .",
    "[ eq : l1]note that such an enlargement does not spoil the unitarity of the first two rows of the ckm matrix .",
    "if we neglect possible cp - violating phases beyond ckm , the left - handed unitary transformation leading to the physical @xmath39 and @xmath33 quarks is a simple rotation in the @xmath40 flavour plane = r_34()= (    cc & - + &    ) such that v_ti&= & v_ti^(0 ) , + v_i&= & v_ti^(0 ) , with @xmath41 .",
    "we are therefore left with only two new parameters beyond the sm , namely the @xmath42 mixing angle @xmath43 and the @xmath33 mass @xmath44 .",
    "these arise from the following @xmath35 invariant yukawa interactions : _ y ( ) = ( ) _ l t_r^0+^ ( ) _ l t^0_r+h.c . and dirac mass terms _",

    "a more accurate determination would take into account the specific phase space region selected by the analyses .",
    "in particular , we point out that the request of exactly two jets ( vetoing any other jet above a certain threshold ) , needed to reduce the @xmath14 background to a reasonable level , may give a larger scale dependence than quoted above .",
    "moreover , more studies are needed on the electroweak corrections . due to the presence of the @xmath149 in the intermediate state , real and virtual photon emissions",
    "are expected to give sizable amplitudes , and the correction to @xmath165 might be as large as several percents  @xcite .      for the @xmath149-associated production , one can follow two complementary search strategies : one based on the selection of two isolated leptons , the other with one isolated lepton and two light jets compatible with the @xmath149 mass . in both cases missing energy and one @xmath15-jet",
    "are also required in the final state , and no other jet is allowed . the main limitation of this analysis is the similarity of the signal with the @xmath14 background , where the jet counting is the only handle to reduce it .",
    "it is worth mentioning that such a similarity with the @xmath14 is also a problem at the theoretical level : @xmath150 is consistently defined and insensitive to the quantum interference with @xmath14 only when extra @xmath15-jets in the final state are vetoed  @xcite .",
    "after the selection , a signal - to - background ratio of 0.37 is expected for the di - leptonic channel and 0.18 for the single - leptonic , the background being almost completely constituted by @xmath14 events . in order to constrain this background , and to cancel out a large part of the main systematics",
    ", one can make use of a control sample and employ the so - called `` ratio method ''  @xcite .",
    "then , the cross section can be rewritten as ^wt = where @xmath170 and @xmath171 are the total number of selected events ( the non-@xmath51 background ) in the main and in the control samples , respectively .",
    "@xmath172 is the signal selection efficiency .",
    "@xmath173 is the ratio of the efficiency in the control sample to the efficiency in the main sample for the signal ( and @xmath174 ) . the uncertainty in the background sample normalization , which dominates @xmath162 in eq . ( [ eq : err ] ) , is now associated to the statistical uncertainty in the large control sample of @xmath175 and the systematic uncertainty due to the background rejection is highly reduced since it only enters in the ratio .",
    "the expected precision on the cross section with 10 fb@xmath68 of integrated luminosity is : = 6%(stat.)16% ( syst.)5%(lum . ) .",
    "this result is obtained by averaging di - leptonic and single - leptonic analyses from ref .",
    "@xcite assuming fully correlated systematic uncertainty . the statistical significance for 10",
    "fb@xmath68 is higher than six standard deviations .    although not competitive with the @xmath39-channel production in terms of the achievable precision in the extraction of @xmath0 , the @xmath149-associated process is still attractive since the observation of the @xmath149 in the final state would prove that the top is produced through a charged current interaction .",
    "as we mentioned above , the definition and the measurement of this channel is difficult due to the large overlap in phase space with @xmath14 , whose cross section is more than ten times larger . in this respect",
    "it is interesting to note that in @xmath176 collisions at the lhc , where protons emit almost real photons colliding with protons of the opposite beam , the @xmath150 and @xmath14 cross sections are of a similar size , leading to a much better signal over background ratio .",
    "work to explore this alternative is on - going  @xcite .    for the @xmath152-channel process @xmath177",
    ", whose signature is one lepton , missing energy and two @xmath15-jets , the @xmath14 background is again difficult to curb and a ratio method has to be applied as in the @xmath150 case .",
    "the final result of the analysis  @xcite , for 10 fb@xmath68 , is : @xmath178 where most of the contribution to the systematics comes from the jet energy scale uncertainty .",
    "if extra quarks exist , either as a @xmath179 gauge singlet or in a doublet , and they are light enough , they could be also discovered at lhc .",
    "the phenomenology of such states has been studied in the literature ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite ) and here we limit ourselves to a brief discussion , highlighting how the @xmath179 nature of the extra quark(s ) could be determined .    in figs .",
    "[ extra_top_1234 ] and  [ extra_top_678 ] the @xmath30 production cross sections are shown for various production modes as a function of the @xmath30 mass . for simplicity ,",
    "we have set latexmath:[$|v_{\\tp b}|=    @xmath30 is equal to the top mass ( @xmath181 gev ) the cross sections are equal to the sm cross sections for top production .",
    "results at lo have been obtained with madgraph / madevent  @xcite , while mcfm  @xcite has been used when calculations at next - to - leading order in qcd were available .    in fig .",
    "[ extra_top_1234 ] the double @xmath30 production cross section is given by the solid line and the single @xmath30 production channels are given by the dashed ( @xmath152-channel ) , dash - dotted ( @xmath39-channel ) and dotted ( @xmath182 ) lines . for @xmath30 masses below @xmath183 gev double @xmath30 production dominates the single @xmath30 production , just as the double top cross section is larger than the single top in sm . above @xmath183",
    "gev the @xmath39-channel becomes the dominant production mechanism , as it is the least dependent on the @xmath30 mass .",
    "note , however , that the single @xmath30 production scales as @xmath184 , while the pair production cross section is independent of it and might still be the dominant production mechanism .",
    "for example , for @xmath185 the single @xmath30 production cross sections decrease by an overall factor of four .    one way to distinguish between a new extra doublet and a vector - like quark is to look for fcncs , which are only present for the vector - like case . at",
    "leading order there are two mechanisms for the production of a @xmath186 pair , _ viz .",
    "_ , through an @xmath152-channel @xmath50 or higgs boson .",
    "the total cross section for the processes @xmath187 and @xmath188 are given by the solid and the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ extra_top_678 ] , respectively .",
    "note that the @xmath189 cross section is almost independent of the @xmath30 mass because of the cancellation of two competing effects , _",
    "i.e. _ , the increase of the @xmath190 coupling and the gluon luminosity suppression for larger @xmath191 .",
    "in this paper we have elaborated on the phenomenology concerning the ckm matrix element @xmath0 in models that relax the strong constraints coming from the unitarity .",
    "we have first emphasized that @xmath32 is required neither from @xmath6 physics nor from the top quark decay rate measurements .",
    "only the direct extraction of @xmath0 from the single top production cross section at the tevatron and at the lhc will allow to complete our knowledge of the ckm matrix and hopefully shed new light on the nature of the top quark .",
    "as a simple extension of the sm that breaks the @xmath117 unitarity condition of the ckm matrix and leads to a deviation from @xmath192 , we have considered the addition of extra fermions : either a vector - like up - type quark ( @xmath33 ) or fourth generation quarks ( @xmath33 and @xmath56 ) . the main motivation for selecting these models is that they serve well the illustrative purpose of our study .",
    "they are simple , self - consistent and allow to easily find the constraints on @xmath0 coming both from precision physics and direct observation . in this respect , they should be regarded as useful templates for further experimental scrutiny on @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the strongest constraint on these models comes from @xmath64 , which severely restricts the allowed amount of @xmath193 mixing .",
    "when this result is combined with the very recent direct bound on the @xmath33 mass by the cdf collaboration , @xmath109 gev , one finds @xmath194 .",
    "this very strong bound relies , however , on two assumptions which might not hold in more sophisticated models .",
    "the first one is that the corrections to @xmath64 induced by loop effects are only coming from the @xmath33 contribution , and therefore models with an extended particle content may be less constrained .",
    "the second assumption , which is at the basis of the lower bound on the @xmath30 mass by cdf , is that the branching ratio of @xmath195 is one .",
    "for instance , this condition is satisfied in our vector - like @xmath30 model only for @xmath196 gev .",
    "if at least one of the above conditions is not fulfilled , we have shown that other indirect measurements , such as those coming from @xmath85 or the @xmath197 oblique parameters should also be considered .    in the near future",
    "the observation of the single top process , which is challenging both at the tevatron and the lhc , will for the first time provide a direct measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "we showed that the current lower bound from tevatron data has started giving direct information on the magnitudes of @xmath28 and @xmath29 , and that they will be further constrained as soon as the lhc data will be available .",
    "among all three possible production mechanisms , the @xmath39-channel is the most promising process where @xmath0 could be determined at the 5% precision level already with 10 fb@xmath68 of integrated luminosity .",
    "the precision of this result is limited by the systematic uncertainty and might be well improved with better understanding of the detector and background .",
    "the other channels , @xmath198associated and @xmath152-channel , are more challenging due to a much larger systematic uncertainty . however , a measurement of these production mechanisms will be important to complete our knowledge of the top quark coupling to the weak current and possibly reveal new physics .",
    "we are thankful to tony liss and scott willenbrock for discussions .",
    "we thank the organizers of the cern workshop `` flavour in the era of the lhc '' for the nice atmosphere that stimulated this work .",
