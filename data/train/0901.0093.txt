    "the most of experimental works on optical properties of single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) indicated that the exciton contributions were dominant in the nanotubes optical spectra  @xcite-@xcite and the exciton binding energies were comparable to the corresponding energy gaps  @xcite,@xcite . these effects were explained ( predicted ) in the theoretical works  @xcite-@xcite on the quasione - dimensional wannier - like excitons in swcnts , which also yielded large , in comparison with the 3d case , exciton binding energies and revealed the determining influence of strong interparticle coulomb interaction in one dimension on the optical properties of nanotubes . it was also shown ( for example , in  @xcite ) , that the potential of interaction between electron and hole , which form an exciton , should be substantially weakened by the dielectric environment surrounding a nanotube .",
    "the dependence of exciton binding energy @xmath2 on the environmental permittivity @xmath3 obtained in  @xcite : @xmath4 with @xmath5 is not similar to that in the 3d case ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "as it was pointed out in  @xcite , the relation @xmath4 with @xmath5 is accurate only for nanotubes surrounded by media with high permittivity ( @xmath7 ) , because the results of calculations based on the ohno potential chosen in  @xcite to model the unscreened coulomb interaction between carbon @xmath8-orbitals is not sensitive to the value of the potential parameter only if the exciton radius is rather large .",
    "this takes place in the environmental permittivities range , which is of technological interest ( silicon oxide environment , etc .",
    ". however , in the most of experiments on optical response of swcnts individual nanotubes were isolated in media with low permittivities : the hydrocarbon environment of sds micelles  @xcite-@xcite ,  @xcite ( by  @xcite the corresponding empirical @xmath9 , while  @xcite used @xmath10 ) ; the polymer matrix environment  @xcite ( used @xmath11 ) ; air  @xcite,@xcite ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "this is why here , using an exciton model , which is not influenced by the exciton radius but depends on the tube radius and carriers effective masses ( and thus on the nanotube chirality ) , we apply the scaling relation for exciton binding energies from  @xcite to excitons in swcnts in low - permittivity media ( @xmath13 ) to obtain the corresponding scaling parameter @xmath14 .    the exciton in a swcnt is modelled here as a bound state of two quasi - particles , which opposite charges are smeared uniformly along infinitesimal narrow bands at the tube surface , with the interaction potential having the coulomb attraction tail ( see section  2 , or  @xcite,@xcite for details ) .",
    "the single - electron spectrum and wave functions were obtained like in  @xcite,@xcite by the zero - range potentials method  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "it turned out , that within the mentioned model the binding energies of excitons in the ground state in nanotubes surrounded by a medium with @xmath10 were in good accordance with the corresponding experimental data from  @xcite and in the range @xmath15 $ ] obey the scaling relation from  @xcite with @xmath16 .",
    "moreover , for the same @xmath10 the differences between the ground - state exciton binding energies and those of the lowest excited states are also in good agreement with the respective experimental results of  @xcite and  @xcite ( section  3 ) .",
    "in the region @xmath17 the ground - state exciton binding energies exceed the corresponding energy gaps .",
    "this leads to instability of the nanotube single - electron states with regard to formation of exctions , which , however , become stabilized because of the additional screening effect stipulated by born excitons . since some of the single - electron states have transformed into excitons the edges of the forbidden band move apart , and this results in the enhancement ( blueshift ) of the lowest optical transition energy like in experiments  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding estimates are in satisfactory agreement with results of  @xcite . besides , in the ranges of low environmental permittivities @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath19 $ ] the ground - state exciton binding energies satisfy the mentioned relation from  @xcite with slightly smaller values of parameter @xmath14 : 1.121 and 1.258 , respectively ( see section  3 ) .",
    "by analogy with the 3d case it can be shown ( like in  @xcite ) that within the long - wave approximation the wave equation for the fourier transform @xmath20 of envelope function in the wave packet from products of the electron and hole bloch functions , which represents a two - particle state of large - radius rest exciton in a quasione - dimensional semiconducting nanotube with the longitudinal period @xmath21 , is reduced to the following 1d schrdinger equation : @xmath22 with the exciton reduced effective mass @xmath23 , the forbidden band width @xmath24 and the electron - hole ( e - h ) interaction potential @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the bloch amplitudes of the bloch wave functions @xmath27 of the conduction and valence band electrons of a swcnt , respectively , and @xmath28 is the electron quasi - momentum . assuming that the charges of electron and hole , which participate in the formation of exciton , are smeared uniformly along infinitesimal narrow bands at the nanotube surface we obtain from  ( [ 2.2 ] ) : @xmath29,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is",
    "the complete elliptic integral of the first kind and @xmath31 is the nanotube radius .",
    "this potential is the simplest approximation to the bare coulomb potential , which accounts the finiteness of the nanotube diameter . at this point of the model swcnts differ only by their radii and the carriers effective masses .",
    "however , even the combination of these parameters allows to specify the nanotube chirality .    to take into account the screening of e - h interaction potential by the nanotube band electrons we have applied the lindhard method ( the so - called random phase approximation ) , according to which the analogue of quasione - dimensional electrostatic potential  ( [ 2.3 ] ) screened by the nanotube @xmath8-electrons is given by the following expression  @xcite : @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the modified bessel functions of the first and second kind , respectively , and the dimensionless screening parameter @xmath35 here @xmath36 numbers @xmath8-electron bands , which are mirror with respect to the fermi level , because only for those bands the matrix element in  ( [ 2.5 ] ) is nonzero  @xcite,@xcite , and @xmath37 is the bare mass from  @xcite,@xcite .",
    "as it was mentioned above , most of existing experiments on the optical response of swcnts  @xcite-@xcite dealt with nanotubes isolated not in vacuum but in media with the dielectric constants different from unity , therefore the corresponding screening of the e - h interaction potential should be also taken into account because a dielectric medium , surrounding a nanotube , should noticeably change the e - h interaction potential .",
    "for example , in experimental works  @xcite-@xcite,@xcite , which used the methods described in  @xcite , investigated isolated swcnts were encased in the sodium dodecyl sulfate ( sds ) cylindrical micelles disposed in heavy water .",
    "because of these sds micelles , which provided a pure hydrocarbon environment around individual nanotubes , the high permittivity solvent @xmath38 did not reach nanotubes . however , the environment of hydrophobic hydrocarbon `` tails '' @xmath39 of the sds molecules has the permittivity greater than unity ( by the experiment  @xcite it is about @xmath40 ) . in accordance with figure  1a from  @xcite and with",
    "@xcite a simple model of a swcnt in a dielectric environment was considered , namely : a narrow , infinite cylinder with radius @xmath31 in a medium with the dielectric constant @xmath3 and some internal screening parameter @xmath41 . the corresponding analogue of potential  ( [ 2.3 ] ) screened by environment within the framework of the mentioned model is given by  @xcite : @xmath42q}{\\mathrm{d}}q.\\ ] ] the internal screening parameter @xmath43 according to  ( [ 2.4 ] ) . as it will be shown further (",
    "section  3 ) , potential  ( [ 2.6 ] ) with this @xmath41 can be used to model the e - h interaction in swcnts isolated in medium with @xmath44 ( e.g. : the sds environment  @xcite , the polymer matrix  @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "the exciton binding energies and envelope functions were obtained within the above - stated exciton model using the wave equation  ( [ 2.1 ] ) with the different e - h interaction potentials  ( [ 2.4 ] ) ,  ( [ 2.6 ] ) and the single - electron parameters ( effective masses , single - particle wave functions , band gaps ) calculated according  @xcite,@xcite within the zero - range potentials method  @xcite,@xcite .    according to the wave equation  ( [ 2.1 ] ) with the e - h interaction potential  ( [ 2.4 ] ) screened only by the nanotube band electrons and that screened also by the external dielectric medium  ( [ 2.6 ] ) we have calculated the binding energies of excitons in different swcnts in vacuum and in the sds environment , respectively ( see table 1 ) .",
    "( @xmath45 is the distance along the tube axis between electron and hole ) and the lowest excited state corresponds to the odd one , further the excited states of different parity actually alternate . ] the experimental value of dielectric constant of the sds environment @xmath46 was taken from  @xcite .",
    "table 1 shows that for these values of @xmath3 there is only a qualitative similarity of the obtained results to the corresponding data from experimental work  @xcite , though this @xmath3 is taken from experiment .",
    "however , if we , following  @xcite , choose @xmath47 the ground - state exciton binding energies become almost identical to those obtained in  @xcite ( see table 2 ) . moreover , for each considered swcnt the obtained difference between the ground - state exciton binding energy and that of exciton in the lowest exited state also becomes almost equal to the respective experimental value from  @xcite . and",
    "@xmath48 from  @xcite and @xmath49 from  @xcite .",
    "recall also , that the exciton states in  @xcite with the even @xmath45-inversion symmetry were indexed by 1 and those with the odd one by 2 . ] the discrepancies between the data from table 2 and the corresponding results from  @xcite for the exciton binding energies and also for the differences @xmath50 and @xmath48 appears to be inessential if the variation of @xmath3 in @xmath51 for different tubes in  @xcite is taken into account .",
    "it is also worth mentioning , that the obtained here differences @xmath50 are also very close to the respective results of experiment  @xcite on swcnts isolated in polymer matrixes .    table 1 also shows that the ground - state binding energies of excitons in nanotubes in vacuum are substantially larger than the corresponding band gaps , while those in nanotubes in the medium with @xmath52 occur already inside of the respective band gaps .",
    "the applicability of effective - mass approximation may seem questionable for such large exciton binding energies @xmath53 in vacuum .",
    "however , it is not the effective - mass approximation that causes so great absolute value of the exciton ground - state energy .",
    "the matter is that the effective - mass approximation consists in the replacement of the original dispersion relations for the valence and conduction bands , which come in the equation for exciton envelope function as @xmath54 , by their expansion to the quadratic terms @xmath55 .",
    "but such a replacement only increases the kinetic part of exciton energy operator and thus can only reduce the absolute values of ( negative ) exciton binding energies .",
    "therefore , without the effective - mass approximation , the exciton binding energies come even larger . besides , the calculations of the exciton radii ( for example , as the root - mean - square deviation of the envelope function fourier transform @xmath56 from the origin on the tube axis ) show that for the ground state in vacuum they are of the order of nanotube diameter @xmath57 , which is much larger than the nanotube longitudinal period @xmath21 , which in its turn is of the order of tube lattice parameter ( @xmath58  nm for cnts ) .",
    "thus , the long - wave approximation formalism is also applicable . later",
    "on we will return to the discussion of seeming instability of the nanotube single - electron states with respect to formation of excitons in swcnts in media with @xmath59 , and for now let us consider in greater detail the interval of environmental dielectric constants @xmath52 .",
    ".the ground - state exciton binding energies @xmath60 for different swcnts in vacuum ( according to the wave equation  ( [ 2.1 ] ) with screened potential  ( [ 2.4 ] ) ) and in the medium with @xmath46 from  @xcite ( according to  ( [ 2.1 ] ) with screened potential  ( [ 2.6 ] ) ) , and also the corresponding results from experimental work  @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     to reveal the general dependence of binding energies of excitons in swcnts on the environmental dielectric constant the corresponding scaling relation from  @xcite is applied . according to  @xcite after taking the logarithm one can obtain from the mentioned relation : @xmath61 where @xmath14 according to  @xcite equals 1.40 , and @xmath62 are some magnitudes , which do not influence on the relation , and introduced here just to make the corresponding variables dimensionless .",
    "the ground - state exciton binding energies obtained using the wave equation  ( [ 2.1 ] ) with potential  ( [ 2.6 ] ) were substituted into  ( [ 3.1 ] ) for the set of swcnts with different diameters ( @xmath63 $ ]  nm ) surrounded by media with permittivities in the range of interest indicated by  @xcite and  @xcite ( @xmath19 $ ] ) . using the least - squares method we found that for these ranges of the nanotubes diameters and environmental permittivities relation  ( [ 3.1 ] ) was valid when @xmath64 ( see figure 1(a ) ) .",
    "it should be noted , that for the same set of nanotubes , but for the environmental dielectric constants range @xmath15 $ ] the calculated value of @xmath14 directly approaches that obtained in  @xcite . according to  @xcite",
    "the scaling relation with @xmath65 is accurate only in the region @xmath7 , this explains the discrepancy between @xmath14 obtained here and that from  @xcite in the region @xmath66 .",

    "<S> the properties of excitons in semiconducting single - walled carbon nanotubes ( swcnts ) , isolated in vacuum or a medium , and their contributions to the optical spectra of nanotubes are studied within the elementary potential model , in which an exciton is represented as a bound state of two oppositely charged quasi - particles confined to the nanotube surface . </S>",
    "<S> the emphasis is given on the influence of dielectric environment surrounding a nanotube on the exciton spectra . </S>",
    "<S> for nanotubes in environment with permittivity less than @xmath0 the ground - state exciton binding energies exceed the respective energy gaps , while the obtained binding energies of excitons in nanotubes in a medium with permittivity greater than @xmath1 are in good accordance with the corresponding experimental data and consistent with known scaling relation for the environmental effect . </S>",
    "<S> the stabilization process of single - electron spectrum in swcnts in media with rather low permittivities is discussed . </S>"
