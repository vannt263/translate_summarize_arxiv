    "according to the textbook of ashcroft and mermin , the hubbard model  is `` a highly oversimplified model '' for strongly interacting electrons in a solid .",
    "the hubbard model  is a kind of minimum model which takes into account quantum mechanical motion of electrons in a solid , and nonlinear repulsive interaction between electrons .",
    "there is little doubt that the model is too simple to describe actual solids faithfully .",
    "nevertheless , the hubbard model  is one of the most important models in theoretical physics . in spite of its simple definition",
    ", the hubbard model  is believed to exhibit various interesting phenomena including metal - insulator transition , antiferromagnetism , ferrimagnetism , ferromagnetism , tomonaga - luttinger liquid , and superconductivity .",
    "serious theoretical studies have also revealed that to understand various properties of the hubbard model  is a very difficult problem .",
    "we believe that in course of getting deeper understanding of the hubbard model , we will learn many new physical and mathematical techniques , concepts , and ways of thinking .",
    "perhaps a more important point comes from the idea of `` universality . ''",
    "we believe that nontrivial phenomena and mechanisms found in the idealized hubbard model can also be found in other systems in the same `` universality class '' as the idealized model .",
    "the universality class is expected to be large and rich enough so that it contains various realistic strongly interacting electron systems with complicated details which are ignored in the idealized model .",
    "the situation is very similar to that of the ising model for classical spin systems .",
    "the ising model is too simple to be a realistic model of magnetic materials , but has turned out to be extremely important and useful in developing various notions and techniques in statistical physics of many degrees of freedom .",
    "many important universality classes ( of spin systems and field theories ) were discovered by studying the ising model .    in the present article ,",
    "we review some mathematically rigorous results known for the hubbard model .",
    "we shall concentrate ourselves mainly on magnetic properties of the model at its ground state , i.e. , at the zero temperature .",
    "we have also decided not to cover many important rigorous and/or exact results in one - dimensional models based on the bethe ansatz solutions . even with these restrictions",
    ", we do not try to cover all the existing rigorous results .",
    "we recall that there is an excellent review article by lieb @xcite which covers wider topics than we do here . as for the more restricted topics of nagaoka s ferromagnetism , flat - band ferromagnetism , and some related topics ,",
    "there is a separate review @xcite which is more detailed and elementary than the present one .",
    "we first give general definition of the hubbard model .",
    "let the lattice @xmath3 be a collection of sites @xmath4 .",
    "physically speaking , each lattice site corresponds to an atomic site in a crystal . in the standard hubbard model ,",
    "one simplifies the situation considerably , and assumes that each atom has only one electron orbit and the corresponding orbital state is non - degenerate .",
    "of course actual atoms can have more then one orbits ( or bands ) and electrons in the corresponding states .",
    "the philosophy behind the model building is that those electrons in other states do not play significant roles in low - energy physics that we are interested in , and can be `` forgotten '' for the moment .",
    "see figure  [ f : tb ] .    by @xmath5",
    ", we denote the operator which creates an electron with spin @xmath6 at site @xmath7 .",
    "the corresponding annihilation operator is @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the number operator .",
    "these fermion operators obey the canonical anticommutation relations @xmath10 and @xmath11 where @xmath12 .    by @xmath13",
    "we denote the state without any electrons .",
    "we have @xmath14 for any @xmath7 and @xmath6 .",
    "the hilbert space of the model is generated by the states obtained by successively operating the creation operator @xmath5 with various @xmath15 and @xmath16 onto the state @xmath13 .",
    "since the anticommutation relation ( [ ac2 ] ) implies @xmath17 , each lattice site can either be vacant , occupied by an @xmath18 or @xmath19 electron , or occupied by both @xmath18 and @xmath19 electrons .",
    "the total dimension of the hilbert space is thus the number of elements in a set @xmath20 . ]",
    "@xmath21 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard model  is most naturally represented as the sum of two terms as @xmath22 the most general form of the hopping hamiltonian @xmath0 is ) , and to assume @xmath23 .",
    "however it seems that there is no simple reason that the hopping amplitude should have such signs .",
    "if the system is bipartite ( see definition [ bipartite ] ) , one can change the sign of all @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) by performing a gauge transformation @xmath26 for all @xmath27 . ]",
    "@xmath28 the hopping amplitude @xmath29 , which is assumed to be real , represents the quantum mechanical amplitude that an electron hops from site @xmath15 to @xmath30 ( or from @xmath30 to @xmath15 ) .",
    "when @xmath31 , the summand in ( [ hhop ] ) becomes @xmath32 , which is nothing but a single - body potential .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian @xmath1 is written as @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a constant .",
    "the hamiltonian represents a nonlinear interaction which raises the energy by @xmath35 when two electrons occupy a single orbital state at @xmath15 .",
    "although the original coulomb interaction is long ranged , we have `` oversimplified '' the situation and took into account the strongest part out of the interaction .",
    "another interpretation is that the coulomb interaction is screened by the electrons in different orbital states which we had decided to forget .",
    "we shall define some basic conserved quantities .",
    "the total number operator @xmath36 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "although there are some conserved quantities other than @xmath38 , one usually discusses stationary states or equilibrium states of the system by keeping the eigenvalue or the expectation value of @xmath38 constant is essentially different since the charge conservation is an exact law .",

    ", we mostly consider is the only exception . ]",
    "the hilbert space in which the number operator @xmath38 has a fixed eigenvalue @xmath39 .",
    "since each lattice site can have at most two electrons , we have @xmath40 .",
    "the total electron number @xmath39 is the most fundamental parameter in the hubbard model .    the spin operator @xmath41 at site @xmath15 is defined as @xmath42 for @xmath43 , and @xmath44 , where @xmath45 are the pauli matrices .",
    "the operators for the total spin of the system are defined as @xmath46 for @xmath43 , and @xmath44 . the operator @xmath47 commute with both the hopping hamiltonian @xmath0 ( [ hhop ] ) and with the interaction hamiltonian @xmath1 ( [ hint ] ) .",
    "in other words , these hamiltonians are invariant under any global rotation in the spin space .",
    "as the operators @xmath47 with @xmath48 do not commute with each other , we follow the convention in the theory of angular momenta , and simultaneously diagonalize the total spin operators @xmath49 , @xmath50 , and the hamiltonian @xmath37 .",
    "we denote by @xmath51 and @xmath52 the eigenvalues of @xmath49 and @xmath53 , respectively . for a given electron number @xmath39",
    ", we let @xmath54 then the possible values of @xmath55 are @xmath56 ( or @xmath57 ) .",
    "when we discuss magnetism of the system , the most important issue is to determine the value of @xmath55 in the ground state(s ) .",
    "if the total spin of the ground state grows proportionally to the number of sites @xmath58 as we increase the size of @xmath3 , we say that the system exhibits ferromagnetism in a broad sense .",
    "this roughly means that the system behaves as a `` magnet . ''",
    "if the total spin of the ground state(s ) coincides with the maximum possible value @xmath59 , we say that the system exhibits saturated ferromagnetism .",
    "the following quantity will be useful in the later analysis .",
    "fix the electron number @xmath39 . for @xmath60 ( or @xmath61 ) , we denote by @xmath62 the lowest possible energy among the states which satisfy @xmath63 and @xmath64 ( i.e. , @xmath65 ) . [ emin ]    the appearance of saturated ferromagnetism is equivalent to have @xmath66 for any @xmath20 such that @xmath67 .",
    "in order to understand the meaning of the hamiltonian of the hubbard model , we discuss physics we encounter in two limiting situations .",
    "let us assume that the coulomb interaction in @xmath1 ( [ hint ] ) satisfies @xmath68 for any @xmath7 . since the remaining hamiltonian @xmath69 ( [ hhop ] ) is a quadratic form in fermion operators , it can be diagonalized easily ( in principle ) .",
    "the single - electron schrdinger  equation corresponding to the hopping hamiltonian @xmath0 ( [ hhop ] ) is @xmath70 where @xmath71 is a single - electron wave function , and @xmath72 is the single - electron energy eigenvalue .",
    "we shall denote the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of ( [ sch ] ) as @xmath73 and @xmath74 , respectively , where the index takes values @xmath75 .",
    "we count the energy levels with taking degeneracies into account , and order them as @xmath76 .",
    "let us discuss a simple and standard example .",
    "take a one dimensional lattice @xmath77 , and impose a periodic boundary condition which identifies the site @xmath78 with the site @xmath79 . as for the hopping matrix elements , we set @xmath80 , and @xmath81 otherwise . the corresponding schrdinger  equation ( [ sch ] )",
    "can be solved easily . by using the wave number @xmath82 ( with @xmath83 ) ,",
    "the eigenstates and the eigenvalues can be written as @xmath84 $ ] and @xmath85 , respectively . if one makes a suitable correspondence between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , we get the desired energy level @xmath88 .",
    "we return to the general setting , and define fermion operators corresponding to the eigenstates @xmath74 by @xmath89 by using the orthonormality of the set of eigenstates @xmath90 ( we redefine the eigenstates if they do not form an orthonormal set ) , one finds that the inverse transformation of ( [ a ] ) is @xmath91 . substituting this into ( [ hhop ] ) , and by using ( [ sch ] ) , we find that @xmath0 can be diagonalized as @xmath92 here @xmath93 can be interpreted as the electron number operator for the @xmath94-th single - electron eigenstate .",
    "let @xmath95 be two arbitrary subsets of @xmath96 which satisfy @xmath97 . by using ( [ hhop2 ] ) , we find that the state @xmath98 is an eigenstate of @xmath69 and its energy eigenvalue is @xmath99 by choosing subsets @xmath95 which minimize @xmath100 , we get ground state(s ) of the non - interacting model .    in particular if the corresponding single - electron energy eigenvalues are nondegenerate , i.e. , @xmath101 , and @xmath39 is even , the ground state of @xmath69 is unique and written as @xmath102 this is nothing but the state obtained by `` filling up '' the low energy levels by up and down spin electrons , as one learns in elementary quantum mechanics ( figure  [ f : pauli ] ) .",
    "it is easily verified that the above state has a definite total spin @xmath103 .",
    "the ground state ( [ gs1 ] ) exhibits no long range order . a system with no magnetic ordering is usually said to exhibit paramagnetism .    in the simple example in one dimension , all the energy levels except @xmath104 and @xmath105 are two - fold degenerate . in this case the ground state of @xmath69 may not be unique for some values of @xmath39 .",
    "however the degeneracy of the ground states is at most four - fold , and the total spin of the ground states can take values in @xmath106 , or @xmath78 .",
    "we can conclude that the property of the ground state(s ) is essentially the same as the models without degeneracy .",
    "in general we can draw the same conclusion unless the single - electron spectrum has a bulk degeneracy .    in a single - electron eigenstate of the example in one dimension ,",
    "the electron is in a plane wave state with a definite wave number @xmath107 .",
    "the fact that the hamiltonian @xmath69 is diagonalized as ( [ hhop2 ] ) implies that the electrons behave as `` waves '' in this non - interacting ( hubbard ) model .",
    "the same comment applies to any translation invariant ( hubbard ) model with @xmath68 .",
    "let us next assume that the hopping matrix elements in @xmath0 ( [ hhop ] ) satisfy @xmath81 for any @xmath108 .",
    "then the remaining hamiltonian @xmath109 ( [ hint ] ) is already in a diagonal form . a general eigenstate can be written as @xmath110 here @xmath111 and @xmath112 are arbitrary subsets of @xmath3 , and represent lattice sites which are occupied by up - spin electrons and down - spin electrons , respectively .",
    "the total electron number in this state is @xmath113 , and the energy eigenvalue is given by @xmath114 the ground state for a given electron number @xmath39 can be constructed by choosing subsets @xmath115 that minimize the energy @xmath116 .",
    "when one has @xmath117 , one can always choose @xmath111 and @xmath112 such that @xmath118 .",
    "thus the ground state has energy equal to @xmath119 .",
    "the ground states of the non - hopping hubbard model has no magnetic long range order .",
    "again the system is paramagnetic .",
    "it is also clear ( from the beginning ) that the electrons behave as `` particles '' in non - hopping models .",
    "we have investigated the properties of the two pieces @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the hubbard hamiltonian .",
    "it turned out that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are easy to analyze .",
    "we also found that neither of them favor any magnetic ordering .",
    "we also observed , however , that electrons behave as `` waves '' in @xmath0 , while they behave as `` particles '' in @xmath1 .",
    "how do they behave in a system with the hamiltonian which is a sum of these totally different hamiltonians ?",
    "this is indeed a fascinating problem which is deeply related to the wave - particle dualism in quantum physics .",
    "we might say that many of the important models in many - body problems , including the @xmath120 quantum field theory and the kondo problem , are minimum models which take into account at the same time the wave - like nature and the particle - like nature ( through point - like nonlinear interaction ) of matter .    from a technical point of view",
    ", the wave - particle dualism implies that the hamiltonians @xmath1 are @xmath0 do not commute with each other .",
    "even when each hamiltonian is diagonalized , it is still highly nontrivial ( or impossible ) to find the properties of their sum .",
    "of course mathematical difficulty does not automatically guarantee that the model is worth studying .",
    "a really exciting thing about the hubbard model is that , though the hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath1 do not favor any nontrivial order , their sum @xmath2 is believed to generate various nontrivial order including antiferromagnetism , ferromagnetism , and superconductivity .",
    "when we sum up the two innocent hamiltonians @xmath0 and @xmath1 , competition between wave - like character and particle - like character ( or between linearity and nonlinearity ) takes place , and one gets various interesting `` physics . '' to confirm this fascinating scenario is a very challenging problem to theoretical and mathematical physicists .",
    "we discuss some theorems which are proved by using special natures of low - dimensional systems .",
    "theorems discussed in the present and the next sections state that the hubbard model does not exhibit interesting long range order under some conditions .",
    "the main purpose of studying an idealized model like the hubbard model  should be to show that some interesting physics _ do _ take place .",
    "results which say something _ does not _ take place may be regarded as less exciting . but to have a definite knowledge that something does not happen under some conditions is very useful and important even if our final goal is to show something does happen .    the classical lieb - mattis theorem @xcite states ( among other things ) that one can never have ferromagnetism in one - dimensional hubbard model   with only nearest neighbor hoppings .",
    "consider a hubbard model  on a one - dimensional lattice @xmath77 with open boundary conditions .",
    "we assume that the hopping matrix elements satisfy @xmath121 when @xmath31 , @xmath122 when @xmath123 , and are vanishing otherwise .",
    "we also assume @xmath124 for any @xmath7 .",
    "then the quantity @xmath62 ( see definition [ emin ] ) satisfies the inequality @xmath125 for any @xmath126 ( or @xmath127 ) .",
    "[ liebmattis ]    one of the most important consequences of the lieb - mattis theorem is that any one - dimensional hubbard model  in the above class has the total spin @xmath103 ( or @xmath128 ) in its ground state",
    ". one can not conclude from this fact alone that the system exhibits paramagnetism , but can conclude that there is no ferromagnetism .",
    "theorem [ liebmattis ] does not apply to models with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "but it seems reasonable that boundary conditions do not change the essential physics provided that the system is sufficiently large .",
    "if there exist hoppings to sites further than the nearest neighbor , on the other hand , the story is totally different .",
    "we do not only find that the proof of theorem [ liebmattis ] fails , but we also find essentially new physics . see section  [ secnew ] .",
    "theorem [ liebmattis ] is proved by noting that , in a suitable basis , the hamiltonian is written as a matrix whose nondiagonal elements are nonpositive , and by using the standard perron - frobenius argument .",
    "similar argument was used by lieb and mattis in their study of the heisenberg quantum spin system @xcite .      among other rigorous results which show",
    "the absence of order is the extension by ghosh @xcite of the wellknown theorem of mermin and wagner .",

    "the method employed in @xcite , i.e. , a combination of the mcbryant - spencer method and the quantum mechanical global @xmath129 gauge invariance , is rather interesting .",
    "it is amusing that only by using the @xmath129 symmetry which exists in _ any _ quantum mechanical system , one gets upper bounds for correlations which are almost optimal at low temperatures ( especially in one - dimension ) .",
    "we discuss a recent important theorem by yamanaka , oshikawa , and affleck @xcite about low - lying excitations in general electron systems on a one - dimensional lattice .",
    "the theorem is an extension of lieb - schultz - mattis theorem for quantum spin chains .",
    "it can also be interpreted as a nonperturbative version of luttinger s `` theorem '' restricted to one - dimension .",
    "we consider the hubbard model on the one - dimensional lattice @xmath143 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the model is characterized by positive integers @xmath144 and @xmath145 , which are the range of hopping and the period of the system , respectively .",
    "we assume @xmath146 whenever @xmath147 , and @xmath148 , @xmath149 for any @xmath150 . under this general assumption , we have the following .",

    "the above theorem guarantees that we can not change the situation by introducing strong interaction .",
    "this is of course far from obvious .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ t : yoa ] is based on the following explicit construction of a ( trial ) low - lying excitation .",

    "this is nothing but the fermi momentum of the free system .",
    "therefore the fermi momentum is not `` renormalized '' by strong interaction among electrons . as far as we know , this is the only general rigorous result which gives precise meaning to fermi momentum in truly interacting many electron systems .",
    "a system in which the electron number @xmath39 is identical to the number of sites @xmath58 is said to be half - filled , since the maximum possible value of @xmath39 is @xmath169 .",

    "and we get a state with one vacant site and one doubly occupied site .",
    "the resulting state is not a ground state of @xmath1 .",

    "this is not only a technical difficulty , but is a consequence of the important fact that quantum mechanical processes allowed in the hubbard model  are in general much richer and more complex than those in the heisenberg model .",
    "lieb s proof is compactly presented in a letter , but is deep and elegant . the proof again makes use of a kind of perron - frobenius argument , but is based on an interesting technique called spin - space reflection positivity .",
    "lieb s theorem is valid for any value of coulomb repulsion @xmath208 , only provided that it is positive .",
    "it is quite likely that physical properties of the hubbard model  are drastically different in the weak coupling region with small @xmath208 and in the strong coupling region with large @xmath208 .",
    "it is very surprising and interesting that a single proof of lieb s covers the whole range with @xmath209 and clarifies the basic properties of the ground states .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the knowledge of the total spin of the ground states in finite volume does not necessarily determine the properties of the ground states in the corresponding infinite system .",
    "when two sublattices have the same number of sites as @xmath210 , for example , one knows that finite volume ground state is unique and has @xmath103 .",
    "although one might well conclude that the system has no long range order in its ground states , this is not true .",
    "it is certainly possible that infinite volume ground states exhibit long range order and symmetry breaking ( such as antiferromagnetism of superconductivity ) even when finite volume ground state is unique and symmetric .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite . ) by knowing any finite volume ground state has @xmath103 , however , one can rule out the possibility of ferromagnetism .    by using lieb s results in @xcite",
    ", one gets some information about excited states .",
    "for example , by combining theorem 1 in @xcite with the method of @xcite , one can easily prove the inequality @xmath211 for any @xmath212 .",
    "another theorem which suggests the similarity between the half - filled hubbard model  and the heisenberg antiferromagnets is the following , proved by shen , qiu , and tian @xcite by extending lieb s method .",
    "assume the conditions for theorem [ lieb ] .",
    "if we denote by @xmath213 the ground state of the model , we have the inequalities @xmath214 were @xmath215 denotes the quantum mechanical inner product .",
    "we see that spins on different sublattices have negative correlations , indicating antiferromagnetic tendency .",
    "the @xmath191 heisenberg antiferromagnet on the cubic lattice , for example , is proved to exhibit an antiferromagnetic long range order at sufficiently low temperatures or in the ground states @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the same statements hold for the half - filled hubbard model  with sufficiently large @xmath208 .",
    "but , for the moment , there are no methods or ideas which are useful in proving the conjecture . to extend",
    "the powerful ( but not very natural ) method of @xcite based on the ( spatial ) reflection positivity seems hopeless .    in the hubbard model and related models at",
    "half - filling , there have been proved several interesting general results . among the recent examples",
    "are the uniform density theorem @xcite , the solution of the flux phase problem @xcite , and the stability of the peierls instability @xcite .",
    "a very important corollary of lieb s theorem [ lieb ] is that the half - filled hubbard models on asymmetric bipartite lattices universally exhibit a kind of ferromagnetism ( in the broad sense ) , or more precisely , ferrimagnetism @xcite .",
    "take , for example , the so called cuo lattice in figure [ figcuo ] .",
    "the lattice can be decomposed into two sublattices distinguished by black sites and white sites .",
    "when the black sites form a square lattice with side @xmath216 , there are @xmath217 black sites and @xmath218 white sites .",
    "we define the hubbard model  on this lattice , and put nonvanishing hopping @xmath24 on each bond in the lattice , and put coulomb interaction @xmath209 on each site .",
    "then lieb s theorem implies that the ground state of this hubbard model  has total spin @xmath219 . since the total spin magnetic moment of the system is proportional to the number of lattice sites @xmath220 , we conclude that the model exhibits ferromagnetism in the broad sense .    of course the present ferromagnetism is not a saturated ferromagnetism in which all the spins in the system completely align with each other .",
    "as the inequality ( [ sqt ] ) suggests , spins on neighboring sites have tendency to point in the opposite direction .",
    "but the big difference in the numbers of sites in the sublattices cause the system to possess bulk magnetic moment . such a magnetic ordering is usually called ferrimagnetism",
    ".    one can similarly construct hubbard models which exhibit ferrimagnetism on any bipartite lattice in which the difference in the number of sites in two sublattices is proportional to the system size .",
    "the value of @xmath209 is again arbitrary , so lieb s ferrimagnetism covers surprisingly general class of models including weakly coupled ones as well as strongly coupled ones .",
    "if one recalls the conclusion of section [ secfree ] that systems with @xmath221 exhibit paramagnetism , one might feel it somehow contradicting that the above ferrimagnetism appears for arbitrarily small @xmath209 .",
    "this is one of the special features of lieb s ferrimagnetism . in the single - electron schrdinger  equation corresponding the hubbard model  on figure [ figcuo ] , for example , the eigenstates for the eigenvalue @xmath222 are @xmath217-fold degenerate .",
    "( the eigenvalue @xmath222 is at the middle of the single - electron spectrum . )",
    "consequently the ground states of the half - filled ( @xmath223 ) system with @xmath221 are highly degenerate , and the total spin can take values in @xmath224 .",
    "the role of coulomb interaction @xmath208 is to lift this degeneracy , and select states with the largest magnetic moment as ground states .      a theorem which can be regarded as a finite temperature version of lieb s theorem was proved by kubo and kishi @xcite .",
    "it deals with the charge susceptibility and the on - site pairing ( superconducting ) susceptibility in a half - filled system at finite temperatures .",

    "the theorem states that the charge and the on - site paring susceptibilities for any wave vector @xmath235 are finite in a half - filled model at finite temperatures .",
    "this means that the model does not exhibit any cdw ordering or superconducting ordering .",
    "ferromagnetism , where almost all of the spins in the system align in the same direction , is a remarkable phenomenon .",
    "standard theories about the origin of ferromagnetism have been the heisenberg s exchange interaction picture , and the stoner criterion derived from the hartree - fock approximation for band electrons .",
    "but there have been serious doubts if these theories really explain the appearance of ferromagnetism in a system of electrons interacting via spin - independent coulomb interaction .",
    "one of the motivations to study the hubbard model  was to understand the origin of ferromagnetism in an idealized situation .",
    "as we have seen in the previous section , half - filled models have tendency towards antiferromagnetism . in this section",
    "we shall concentrate on systems in which the electron numbers deviate from half - filling .",

    "although the model is rather artificial , this is the first rigorous example of saturated ferromagnetism in a non - singular hubbard model  on which we have to overcome the competition between @xmath1 and @xmath0 . in a class of similar models",
    ", it is also proved that low - lying excitation above the ground state has a normal dispersion relation of a spin - wave excitation @xcite .",
    "starting from a hubbard model  model of itinerant electrons , the existence of a `` healthy '' ferromagnetism is established rigorously .",
    "if we set @xmath357 in the present model , the ground states of the single - electron schrdinger  equation become @xmath358-fold degenerate . in this case",
    ", the model exhibits saturated ferromagnetism ( flat - band ferromagnetism ) for any @xmath209 .",
    "theorem [ hal ] for @xmath359 can be regarded as a solution to the problem about stability of flat - band ferromagnetism against perturbation to the hopping hamiltonian .",
    "the basic strategy in the proof of theorem [ hal ] is first to establish the existence of saturated ferromagnetism in a hubbard model  on a chain with five sites , and then `` connect '' together these local ferromagnetism to get ferromagnetism in the whole system . generally speaking ,",
    "this is a crazy idea . in a quantum mechanical system , especially in a system with healthy dispersion (",
    "like the present one ) , electrons have strong tendency to extend in a large region and reduce kinetic energy . to confine electrons in a finite region usually costs extra energy . to obtain exact information about large system from smaller system",
    "seems to be impossible .",
    "the reasons that such a strategy works in the present model are twofold .",
    "one is the special construction of the model .",
    "the other is that we described electron states using a language which takes into account both the particle - like character of electrons and the band structure of the model .",
    "the latter is a natural strategy to deal with the hubbard model  in which wave - particle dualism generate interesting physics .",
    "it is believed that the ground states of the present hubbard model  describes an insulator .",
    "when the electron number is less than @xmath358 , we expect that the present model exhibits metallic ferromagnetism in which the same set of electrons participate in conduction as well as magnetism-@xmath360 model .",
    "moreover , by considering models close to the flat - band model , one can make @xmath361 arbitrarily small .",
    "this observation gives a strong support to the above conjecture . ] .",
    "for the moment , we still do not know of any useful ideas in proving this fascinating conjecture .",
