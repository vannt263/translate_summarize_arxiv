    "the x - ray flux of a large fraction of the bursts detected by _",
    "swift _ exhibits a rapid decline with time , as @xmath3 or faster , for about 10 minutes @xcite after trigger .",
    "this is often followed by a slowly declining light curve ( lc ) , with the flux falling - off as @xmath4 for a few hours .",
    "the extrapolation of the fast declining x - ray lc backward in time matches the lc during the burst , which suggests that the early x - ray and late @xmath0-ray emissions are produced by the same source @xcite .",
    "the fastest decline of the lc from a relativistic source moving at lorentz factor @xmath5 and of angular size @xmath6 arises when the source switches - off quickly due to , for instance , a rapid adiabatic cooling at the end of the ejecta heating episode . in this case",
    ", the observed flux declines as @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is the spectral index of the burst emission , i.e. @xmath9 . the observed decline rate of the early x - ray lc is often at this theoretical limit @xcite , therefore the @xmath0-ray source must have a finite , short life and , consequently , must be distinct from the much longer lived afterglow source .",
    "in this paper we determine some properties of the @xmath0-ray source and its distance from the center of the explosion using the early time data obtained by instruments aboard the swift satellite .",
    "the early x - ray light curve can be used to determine the distance of the @xmath0-ray source ( @xmath10 ) from the central explosion , as suggested by lazzati & begelman ( 2006 ) and lyutikov ( 2006 ) . however , instead of using the unknown grb jet angle to determine @xmath10 , as done in previous works , we determine the source radius in terms of the forward shock radius , which has a very weak dependence on the only unknown parameter : the density of the circumstellar medium . in order to exploit this method",
    ", we analyze the @xmath0-ray , x - ray and optical data within the first 10 minutes for ten _ swift _ bursts for which we can establish that the steeply falling off portion of the lc is the large - angle emission .",
    "some conditions need to be satisfied by the rapidly falling - off early x - ray afterglow lc to be identified with the large - angle emission from the @xmath0-ray source .",
    "these conditions are : @xmath11 the temporal decay index ( @xmath12 ) of the x - ray lc during the steep decline phase should be equal to @xmath13 ; @xmath14 the spectral index @xmath8 during early x - ray afterglow should be the same as at the end of the gamma - ray burst ; @xmath15 the x - ray afterglow flux extrapolated to the end of the prompt @xmath0-ray emission should be same as the @xmath0-ray flux at the end of the burst extrapolated to the x - ray band .",
    "we apply an additional condition : @xmath16 , where @xmath17 & @xmath18 are the beginning and end of the steep x - ray decline phase , to ensure that we have a sufficiently long baseline for an accurate determination of @xmath12 ( i.e. this index will not be too sensitive to the uncertainty in the origin of time ) .",
    "ten bursts detected by _ swift _ between january 2005 and may 2006",
    "meet these four conditions .",
    "four of these bursts have a single - peaked lc or are fred ( fast rise , exponential decline ) shaped ; the remaining six bursts contain multiple peaks .",
    "the relevant properties for these 10 grbs are listed in table 1 .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the first optical data for grb 060223a was obtained at 187s after the bat trigger whereas the steep decline of the x - ray lc ended at 85s ( @xmath19s ) .",
    "the extrapolation of the x - ray flux at 85s to the optical band gives a v - mag of 16.3 whereas the observed flux at 187s was 17.8 mag .",
    "for all other bursts uvot measurements were between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "+ @xmath20 ratio of fluence from the end of grb to time @xmath18 in 0.3 - 10 kev band and the fluence in 15 - 150 kev band during the burst .",
    "@xmath21 ratio of the expected to observed optical flux ( or upper limit ) at the time of uvot observation .",
    "the expected flux is the extrapolation of the x - ray flux to the optical band using the xrt spectral index .",
    "@xmath22 in units of @xmath23 cm .",
    "the radius ( @xmath24 ) and the lf ( @xmath25 ) of the shock front in the csm are related by @xmath26 .",
    "since the energy of the lae source is a significant fraction of the total grb energy , it must have provided a good part of the kinetic energy deposited in the csm , thus the lf of the lae source , @xmath5 , should be larger than @xmath25 . given that @xmath27 ^ 2 ( t_2/t_\\gamma)$ ] , @xmath28 implies that @xmath29 .",
    "for the ten bursts in our sample , @xmath30 is between 5 and 25 ; the average value of @xmath30 is 14.0 for the four freds and 13.5 for the six non - freds .",
    "if the deceleration time for csm shock , @xmath31 , is less than @xmath18 ( as expected because the x - ray flux is decreasing monotonically ) then the initial lf of the csm shock , @xmath32 , is larger than the lf at deceleration by a factor 2 , and @xmath33 is smaller than @xmath30 by a factor @xmath34 .",
    "therefore , we conclude that @xmath0-rays are produced within a factor @xmath34 of the deceleration radius , on the average , for our sample of bursts .",
    "we now calculate @xmath35 and estimate @xmath10 .",
    "the forward shock radius at time @xmath18 can be calculated from the dynamics of adiabatic blast - waves , which yields @xmath36^{1/4}$ ] , where @xmath37 is the isotropic equivalent of energy in the fs and @xmath38 is the mean density of the csm within a sphere of radius @xmath35 .",
    "the former is obtained from the grb fluence and the csm density ( or an upper limit for @xmath38 ) is calculated from the x - ray and optical flux at @xmath18 . for the bursts in our sample , we find @xmath39 provided that x - rays are produced via the synchrotron process ( no conditions were imposed on microphysics parameters @xmath40 and @xmath41 in this calculation ) ; the constraint on @xmath38 is weaker if x - rays are produced via the synchrotron - self - compton process .",
    "@xmath42 along the jet axis , within the radius @xmath43 cm , means that the mass loss rate divided by the wind speed from the progenitor star in the polar region , in the last @xmath44 year of its life , was smaller than typical wolf - rayet stars by at least a factor of a few 10s . ] from the grb fluence and assuming @xmath45 , we calculate the forward shock radii @xmath35 and lfs , @xmath46^{1/2}$ ] , given in table 2 . from @xmath35",
    ", we calculate the lower bound on the @xmath0-ray source distance from the center of explosion and find it to be between 10@xmath47 and 10@xmath48 cm .",
    "note that @xmath24 and @xmath25 have a very weak dependence on @xmath37 and @xmath38 and therefore any error in @xmath37 or @xmath38 has small effect on these quantities .",
    "although we find that the burst and early afterglow data are not incompatible with @xmath49 , the forward shock ( fs ) model for @xmath0-ray generation can be ruled out because the @xmath0-ray production mechanism is short - lived and because the fs produces too much optical flux ( see below ) .",
    "furthermore , ramirez - ruiz & granot ( 2006 ) have pointed out that the the relations between the spectral peak , flux and burst duration expected if @xmath0-rays are produced in the forward shock are not satisfied by the grb prompt emission .",
    "all ten bursts in our sample have deep optical upper limits or detections a few minutes after the burst  typically at the beginning of the steeply declining x - ray lc  provided by the uv - optical telescope aboard _",
    "swift_. from the x - ray flux and spectrum at the time of the optical observations , we estimate the expected flux in the optical band and find it to exceed the observed value or upper limit by two orders of magnitude or more ( table 2 )",
    ". a large extinction in the optical can be ruled out because late time optical data show it to be less than a factor 2 .",
    "moreover , in those cases with optical detections , the optical spectrum is consistent with @xmath50 , similar to the spectrum in the x - ray band .",
    "thus , the deep optical upper limits set by uvot require that the spectrum of the x - ray/@xmath0-ray source turns over at lower energies and becomes steeper than @xmath51 , i.e. that the optical band often lies below the synchrotron self - absorption frequency ( @xmath52 ) of the early x - ray/@xmath0-ray emission .",
    "it also implies that the optical flux detected at early times must come from a different source .",
    "a straightforward calculation of forward shock emission shows that , if the x - ray emission at time @xmath17 is produced via the synchrotron process , then @xmath53 ev .",
    "this result holds even when we allow for an external medium enriched with up to @xmath54 e@xmath55 pairs per proton .",
    "therefore , the forward shock model does not satisfy the @xmath56 ev requirement needed to reconcile the optical and x - ray data at early times .",
    "if x - rays arise from synchrotron - self - compton process then the spectrum below 0.3 kev can be as steep as @xmath57 , however , the optical flux associated with the underlying synchrotron radiation exceeds the observed limit .",
    "we now consider the internal shock model for prompt @xmath0-ray generation . according to this model , fluctuations in the lf of the relativistic outflow lead to collisions between faster and slower ejecta , producing internal shocks and @xmath0-ray radiation .",
    "no relationship is expected , in general , between where these collisions take place and the deceleration radius , whereas we find the average @xmath58 .",
    "we also found that the average value of @xmath59 is the same for bursts with multiple @xmath0-ray light curve spikes and for fred bursts .",
    "this suggests that gamma - rays are produced at a radius that is not set by the variability time scale of the central engine , contrary to what is expected in the internal shock model .",
    "the grb ejecta should consist of baryonic material and/or @xmath60 in order to undergo internal shocks .",
    "the interaction of such ejecta with the csm launches a reverse shock moving into the ejecta , heating it and producing synchrotron radiation that peaks in the optical band ( panaitescu & 1998 ) and declines with time as @xmath61 ( sari & piran 1999 ) .",
    "it is widely believed that such an emission from shocked ejecta was seen for grbs 990123 and 021211 .    in figure 1",
    ", we show the early optical light curve for these two bursts resulting after subtracting the extrapolation of the late time optical emission , which arises in the forward shock .",
    "this extrapolation is justified because the optical light curves for many swift bursts display a single power - law decline from @xmath62 s to hours @xcite .",
    "we find that , after subtracting the forward shock contribution , the early light curves of grbs 990123 and 021211 decline as @xmath63 .",
    "this decline is steeper than expected for the reverse - shock optical emission and is similar to that of the early x - ray lcs .",
    "therefore , it is likely that the steeply falling early optical emissions of these bursts are produced via the same mechanism as the early x - ray , i.e. the lae from the @xmath0-ray source ( panaitescu et al .",
    "this interpretation is also supported by the observations that for both these bursts the prompt emission spectrum below the peak is @xmath51 .",
    "furthermore , a good fraction of swift bursts have been followed in the optical starting at a few minutes after the burst and most of these have either weak optical flux or very stringent upper limit on the flux ( roming et al .",
    "therefore , we lack evidence for the expected reverse - shock emission from a baryonic / leptonic ejecta .",
    "there are various possibilities to account for a dim reverse - shock emission including the obvious one that there is no reverse shock because the baryonic / leptonic component in grb outflows is small and the bulk of the explosion energy is carried outward by magnetic fields .",
    "we can obtain further insights regarding @xmath0-ray sources by modeling the average properties of the prompt emission in our set of grbs .",
    "the basic procedure is to calculate the synchrotron and ic radiations for a relativistic , shock heated medium and compare this to the average burst spectrum and variability timescale .",
    "this synchrotron and ic radiation is completely described by five parameters : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath5 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 , which are respectively , magnetic field strength , optical depth of the source to thompson scattering , the lf of the source , the total number of shocked electrons , and the lowest lf of electrons in the source comoving frame just behind the shock front ; the electron distribution just behind the shock front is a power - law function of index @xmath68 which is constrained by the observed high energy spectra .",
    "the distribution in the source as a whole has a more complicated shape due to radiative losses which we calculate using the five parameters .",
    "we determine which part of the 5d parameter space produces radiation matching the observed low energy spectral index , peak energy , flux at the peak , and average pulse duration of the grbs in our sample .",
    "the solutions we find apply to any relativistic - shock heated medium  internal or external shocks .",
    "we first attempt to describe the prompt emission of these 10 bursts with synchrotron radiation .",
    "the low energy ( 20 - 150 kev ) spectral index for 6 of the 10 bursts is @xmath69 , and therefore the synchrotron cooling frequency ( @xmath70 ) should be larger than about 150 kev and the injection frequency @xmath71 below 20 kev .",
    "this constraint along with peak flux of 0.2 mjy and pulse duration of 10s produces a 5d solution space with @xmath72 and @xmath73 cm ( fig .",
    "this is in contradiction to what we found using the steep x - ray light curve decay ",
    "@xmath74 cm and bulk lf of @xmath75 ( table 2 ) .",
    "this discrepancy suggests that synchrotron radiation from a relativistically shock heated medium ( internal or external shocks ) can not describe the prompt @xmath0-ray emission properties of the grbs in our sample . for the remaining four grbs , @xmath76 and both @xmath71 and @xmath70 should be below 20 kev .",
    "the synchrotron solutions for this case for the most part are very similar to the previous synchrotron case .",
    "there are a few intriguing solutions consistent with the @xmath10 and @xmath5 found in the lae calculation , but the prompt optical flux is very bright , and can also be ruled out",
    ". therefore , we rule out synchrotron emission in shock heated medium as the mechanism for grb prompt emission does not vary by a large factor across the source . ] .",
    "is it possible that the @xmath0-rays were produced via synchrotron - self - compton ( ssc ) process in a relativistic shock ?",
    "we perform the 5d parameter space search for ssc radiation for both of the @xmath77 cases described above and find that ( for either @xmath77 ) the source radius @xmath10 and @xmath5 for the allowed 5d parameter space are consistent with the values we obtained for our sample in table 2 ( see fig .",
    "2b ) . the problem , however , is that the prompt optical flux with ssc is many orders of magnitude larger than the observational upper limits ( fig .",
    "it is very unlikely that this large flux has gone undetected because of dust extinction or bursts going off at very high redshifts @xcite .",
    "therefore , we conclude that grb prompt emission is not due to the ssc process in relativistic shocks either .",
    "this means that synchrotron or ssc from any shock model has problems describing the @xmath0-ray emission in any of the bursts in our sample  and that internal & external shocks can be ruled out as possible @xmath0-ray emission mechanisms .",
    "we have described a few problems with the external and internal shock models and , more generally , for any model based on shock physics .",
    "these together with the lack of evidence for baryonic outflow  no firm detection of reverse - shock emission in grbs  suggests that grb prompt emission is produced by some very different process .",
    "it either involves a very different kind of shock physics than we see during grb afterglows , which seems unlikely , or @xmath0-ray generation does not involve shocks , such as , for instance , would be the case when magnetic field transports the energy in grb outflows and its dissipation produces the radiation we see cf .",

    "the poynting outflow , however , might have difficulty explaining the observed variability of grb prompt light curve ( personal communication , piran ) .",
