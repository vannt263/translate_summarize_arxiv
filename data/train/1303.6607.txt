    "the galactic supernova remnant ( snr ) puppis  a is one of the so - called  oxygen - rich \" snrs , in which oxygen - rich fast - moving optically emitting ejecta knots ( ofmks ) are identified .",
    "so far , eight other snrs , cas  a and g292.0 + 1.8 in our galaxy and six others in the magellanic clouds and ngc  4449 , are categorized in this class ( * ? ? ? * for a recent summary ) . of these ,",
    "puppis  a is particularly interesting , because all of ofmks are located in the eastern and northeastern ( ne ) portion @xcite , while the stellar remnant is moving in the opposite southwestern direction @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with recent models , which predicts that sn ejecta are expelled preferentially in one direction , while the stellar remnant receives a kick in the opposite direction ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "thus , puppis  a is an extremely important target for the study of sn explosion mechanisms as well as sn nucleosynthesis .",
    "puppis  a is one of the brightest snrs in the x - ray sky .",
    "the x - ray emission has been thought to be dominated by strong cloud - shock interactions ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* references therein ) .",
    "a large area of the remnant was recently mapped by x - ray observatories in orbit , i.e. , _ xmm - newton _ , _ chandra _ , and _",
    "suzaku_. they confirmed earlier results that the x - ray emission is dominated by the swept - up interstellar medium @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the data also revealed signatures of sn ejecta in three locations : a si - rich clump @xcite , a bright o - ne - mg-(si - s)-rich knot ( the ejecta knot called hereafter : * ? ? ? * ) , whose southern portion is positionally coincident with an  @xmath2\"-shaped ofmk ( the so - called @xmath2 filament named by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and an o - ne - mg - rich filament ( the ejecta filament called hereafter : * ? ? ?",
    "all of them are located in the ne quadrant , further supporting the one - sided ejection of sn debris .    while picking up ejecta features",
    "reveal two dimensional ejecta distributions on the plane of the sky , measurements of doppler velocities can provide us with line - of - sight structures ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review of kinematics of x - ray snrs ) .",
    "@xcite found that the ejecta knot described above shows blueshifted k - shell lines .",
    "the doppler velocities were measured to be 3400@xmath9  at the northern knot and 1700@xmath10  at the southern knot which agrees with the optical measurement of @xmath61500  @xcite .",
    "the possible different doppler velocities between the north and the south led us to suggest that the ejecta knot actually consists of two different knots which appear to be located close with each other .",
    "however , the poor quality of the data prevented us from making strong arguments ; the x - ray data were taken by the _ xmm - newton _",
    "european photon imaging camera ( epic : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with moderate spectral resolution ( @xmath11 ) , and also the ejecta knot was detected at the edge of the field of view ( fov ) where calibration uncertainties would be large .    here",
    ", we report on precise doppler measurements for the ejecta knot and the ejecta filament in puppis  a , based on the unprecedented spectral resolution x - ray spectra ( @xmath12 ) obtained by the reflection grating spectrometer ( rgs : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) onboard _ xmm - newton_. in addition , we give a restrictive upper limit on an oxygen temperature of the ejecta knot , for the first time .",
    "these new measurements allow us to discuss the nature of the ejecta knot in detail .",
    "we performed an _ xmm - newton _ observation of puppis  a on 2012 october 20 ( obs.id 0690700201 ) , aiming at the fast - moving ejecta knot coincident with the optical @xmath2 filament .",
    "our primary instrument in this observation is the rgs that can produce high - resolution x - ray spectra , while we also make use of the epic data to support the rgs results as well as to obtain additional information .",
    "the dispersion direction of the rgs is 96@xmath13.4 measured east to north , as we show in figure  [ fig : image ] left  an x - ray image of puppis  a generated by existing _",
    "xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ data .",
    "fortunately , no background flare is seen in our light curve , allowing us to use full exposure times of 20.8ks , 12.1ks , and 11.7ks for the rgs1/2 , mos1 , and mos2 , respectively .",
    "all the raw data were processed using version 11.0.0 of the xmm science analysis software and the calibration data files available in 2012 may .",
    "the slitless rgs spectrometer is generally not useful for extended sources like puppis  a , because off - axis emission along the dispersion direction is detected at wavelength positions shifted with respect to the on - axis source , which causes degradation of energy resolution .",
    "however , if the angular size of the target is small enough ( @xmath14 a few arc minutes ) and is brighter than its surroundings , it is possible to obtain high - resolution spectra for them .",
    "our on - axis source , the ejecta knot , is such a lucky case , for which we are able to obtain an order - of - magnitude better resolution spectra than nondispersive ccds .",
    "there is another ejecta feature , i.e. , the ejecta filament described in the introduction , within the rgs fov .",
    "since the angular size of the filament along the dispersion direction is as thin as 1@xmath15 , we can also find its signatures in the rgs spectrum .",
    "the two ejecta features of interest are indicated on a _ chandra _ image shown in figure  [ fig : image ] right .",
    "the analysis method basically follows our previous work @xcite .",
    "briefly , we first extract four rgs spectra from 0@xmath16.8-width sectors along the cross - dispersion direction .",
    "we then smooth the rgs response designed for on - axis point sources , based on emission profiles along the dispersion direction by using the rgsrmfsmooth software .",
    "finally , we fit the rgs spectrum with emission models in the xspec package @xcite .",
    "the rgs background ( bg ) is generated from a blank - sky observation ( lockman hole : obs.id 0147511601 ) , as we did in our previous work .",
    "the blank - sky bg emission is less than 1% of the source emission in the energy band analyzed .    here",
    ", the rgs response in each region is smoothed with three distinct emission profiles responsible for ( 1 ) the ejecta knot , ( 2 ) the ejecta filament , and ( 3 ) their surrounding diffuse emission , so that we can derive physical parameters for individual features .",
    "emission profiles are generated with either the _ chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ image , for which we take account of vignetting effects of _ xmm - newton _ s x - ray telescope and the asymmetry of the effective area along the dispersion axis described in the literature @xcite . the emission profiles for the ejecta features are extracted from _",
    "chandra _ images masked for them , for which we subtract underlying diffuse emission by interpolating the surrounding diffuse emission .",
    "we have checked that , even if we change the intensity of underlying diffuse emission by @xmath320% which is a small - scale inhomogeneity around the ejecta knot , the fit results presented below are not affected significantly .",
    "figure  [ fig : prof ] shows the x - ray emission profiles in 0.60.7kev for the four regions .",
    "the three profiles in each panel are responsible for ( 1 ) the ejecta knot in blue , ( 2 ) the ejecta filament in red , and ( 3 ) the surroundings in black .",
    "figures  [ fig : rgsspec1 ] and [ fig : rgsspec2 ] shows bg - subtracted rgs1 and rgs2 spectra for the four regions .",
    "while most of the emission is due to overall diffuse emission which acts as effective bg emission in our analysis , several peaks can be identified as line emission from our interesting two ejecta features .",
    "some of them are indicated in the plot as blue and red labels for the ejecta knot and the ejecta filament , respectively .",
    "note that there is large wavelength shifts in line centroids between the knot ( blue ) and the filament ( red ) by about 1 .",
    "this is mainly due to the off - axis position ( about 8@xmath15 ) of the filament ; an offset of 1@xmath15 causes a wavelength shift of 0.138 .",
    "we use data in the energy range of 0.51kev ( 2413 ) where line emission from the ejecta features are clearly detected . dividing the energy band into four sections , 0.50.6kev , 0.60.7kev , 0.70.85kev , and 0.850.97kev",
    ", we generate rgs responses using the same energy - band images .",
    "we note that the available energy ranges for the rgs1 and the rgs2 are limited to 0.50.8 ( 2415.5 ) and 0.651kev ( 1913 ) , respectively , since chip # 7 in the rgs1 and chip # 4 in the rgs2 are no longer operating .",
    "the rgs spectra consist of diffuse emission and emission from the ejecta knot and ejecta filament .",
    "we model the diffuse emission and the ejecta in terms of a nonequilibrium ionization shock model ( the vpshock model : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and individual gaussian components , respectively .",
    "we use nine gaussian components for the ejecta knot and six for the ejecta filament .",
    "we impose the gaussians in the knot component to be  he@xmath0 forbidden at @0.561kev ( 22.1 ) ,  he@xmath0 intercombination at @0.568kev ( 21.8 ) ,  he@xmath0 resonance at @0.574kev ( 21.6 ) ,  ly@xmath0 @0.654kev ( 19.0 ) ,  he@xmath1 @0.666kev ( 18.6 ) ,  ly@xmath1 @0.775kev ( 16.0 ) ,  he@xmath0 forbidden @0.905kev ( 13.7 ) ,  he@xmath0 intercombination @0.915kev ( 13.6 ) , and  he@xmath0 resonance @0.922kev ( 13.5 ) .",
    "the six gaussians for the filament component are the same o k - shell lines listed above . for the diffuse component , the degradation of rgs spectra is sever owing to the large spatial extent ;",
    "the effective spectral resolution is much worse than the nondispersive ccds .",
    "therefor , it is difficult to constrain numerous parameters , hence in our fitting procedure , we only allow the electron temperature , @xmath17 , and normalizations to vary freely , fixing the intervening hydrogen column density , @xmath18 , to be 3@xmath710@xmath19@xmath20 and the range of the ionization timescale , _ et , from zero up to 3@xmath710@xmath21@xmath22s , based on recent x - ray measurements @xcite . for the gaussian components , we allow all normalizations to vary freely .",
    "line centroids are fixed to theoretically expected values @xcite , but we allow a redshift parameter to vary freely , keeping the same value for all gaussians in either the knot or the filament component .",
    "line broadening of the knot component is a free parameter taken to be proportional to line center energies as is expected for a collisionless shock heating . that of the filament component is set to zero , since line emission from the filament is not very clear in the rgs spectrum . for the knot component in regions a , b , and c",
    ", we measure redshift and line broadening separately for the rgs1 and the rgs2 , so that we can evaluate systematic uncertainties in our measurements and also see if energy dependence is present ; the rgs1 covers 0.50.8kev including o k - shell lines while the rgs2 covers 0.651kev including o and ne k - shell lines , respectively . before bg subtraction , each spectrum is grouped into bins with at least @xmath625 counts , which allows us to perform a @xmath23 test .    with this fitting strategy , we obtain fairly good fits for all the spectra as shown in figure  [ fig : rgsspec1 ] , where individual knot and filament components are shown in blue and red , respectively , as well as the total model in green . the fit results are summarized in table  [ tab : rgsresults ] .",
    "overall , the redshifts and line broadening derived from the rgs1 and the rgs2 are consistent with each other , suggesting no significant energy dependence for these parameters .",
    "we also fitted the rgs2 spectra , by using a specific energy band for  he@xmath0 lines , finding consistent results as in table  [ tab : rgsresults ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : rgsspec2 ] shows close - up rgs spectra for o k - shell lines . in this plot , we show the best - fit models shifted at rest - frame positions ( i.e. , redshift = 0 ) in green .",
    "the doppler shifts of the ejecta knot are clearly seen .",
    "the blueshift measured at the southernmost region ( region d ) , 1560@xmath360 , is consistent with our previous x - ray measurements @xcite , significantly reducing the uncertainty .",
    "it also matches with the previous optical measurements for the @xmath2 filament : 1520@xmath340  or 1570@xmath320  from the sit or ccd spectrum , respectively @xcite . while the blueshifts in the four regions are all close with each other , that in the northernmost region is slightly slower than the other regions .",
    "this conflicts with our previous measurements that suggested a faster velocity in the north of the knot than that in the south . given",
    "much improved spectral resolution in the current data , we believe that the result presented here is more reliable than the previous one . as for the slightly slower velocity",
    ", it may indicate that the northern part is responsible for a tail structure delayed from the main body of the ejecta knot .",
    "we find , for the first time , that line emission from ejecta filament is redshifted by @xmath6650 .",
    "line broadening in the ejecta knot is found to be fairly narrow .",
    "it ranges from 0 to 0.9ev at 0.654kev in the four regions , which we take as our measurement uncertainty .",
    "based on the relation between temperatures and line broadening , @xmath24 @xcite , we obtain an upper limit of an oxygen temperature to be 30kev .",
    "line intensity ratios measured are consistent with those expected by a non - equilibrium ionization plasma model .",
    "we have indeed confirmed that the vnei model @xcite can also well reproduce the rgs spectra ( values of @xmath23/d.o.f .",
    "range from 1.4 to 1.6 ) with plausible electron temperatures , @xmath60.41kev , an ionization timescale of 2@xmath710@xmath83s , and both doppler shifts and line broadening consistent with those in table  [ tab : rgsresults ] .",
    "since the rgs spectra are heavily contaminated by the surrounding diffuse emission in our case , electron temperatures and ionization timescales for our interesting features are better constrained by the mos rather than the rgs .",
    "we thus analyze the mos spectra for the ejecta knot .",
    "as shown in a close - up _ chandra _ image in figure  [ fig : mosregions ] , the knot appears to consist of three parts : north , west , and south .",
    "we extract spectra from these features .",
    "local bgs are taken from the adjacent regions .",
    "we sum up data taken by the mos1 and the mos2 to improve photon statistics .",
    "the local - bg subtracted mos1 + 2 spectra together with the best - fit vnei model ( the augmented version 2.0 : * ? ? ? * ) , are presented in figure  [ fig : mosspec ] .",
    "it is difficult to measure absolute ( relative to hydrogen ) metal abundances for metal - rich plasmas , because continuum emission comes from the metals themselves and no longer reflects the amount of hydrogen , and also because in our case the continuum emission from the ejecta knot is difficult to estimate adequately , given that a considerable fraction of the x - ray emission is due to local bg that can not be subtracted perfectly .",
    "therefore , in our spectral modeling , we examine two abundance patterns : in case a , we assume the fe / h abundance to be the solar value @xcite as line emission from fe is not evident in our x - ray spectra , while in case b , we assume the o / h abundance to be 2000 times the solar value which is derived from optical spectroscopy of the @xmath2 filament @xcite .",
    "we find that the vnei model represents the data fairly well for both of the two cases .",
    "the best - fit models presented in figure  [ fig : mosspec ] are those for case a which gives slightly better fits than case b. table  [ tab : mosresults ] summarizes the results and notes details of our fitting .",
    "the blueshifts from the mos spectra are in reasonable agreements with the rgs measurements , considering the relatively large calibration uncertainty ( @xmath35ev ) on the energy scale of the mos .",
    "we also confirm the elevated abundances of o , ne , and mg compared with fe . on the other hand , the electron temperatures and ionization timescales are outside statistical uncertainties of our previous measurements @xcite",
    ". the discrepancy would be partly due to the different data quality ; the data were taken at the edge ( previous ) or center ( this time ) of the fov , and partly due to the different fitting strategy ; we here use ( 1 ) the most recent version of the vnei code , ( 2 ) different spectral extraction regions , and ( 3 ) different energy band , and also we fix @xmath25 to be 3@xmath710@xmath19@xmath20 @xcite , but allow abundances of c and n to vary freely . not only these analysis improvements but also the fact that blueshifts derived here are closer to the rgs measurements assure reliability of the current results rather than the previous ones .    assuming the plasma depths to be 1@xmath15 ( or @xmath60.6pc at a distance of 2.2kpc :",
    "* ) , which is roughly the size of the knot , we calculate densities and masses in each region .",
    "although it is often assumed that a density ratio between electrons and protons to be unity or so , this assumption is incorrect for super - metal rich plasmas like the ejecta knot in puppis  a. therefore , we here calculate the ratio , taking account of abundances as well as ion fractions based on the spex code @xcite .",
    "then , the emission measures and abundances give densities and masses for each species as summarized in table  [ tab : dens_mass ] .",
    "the total mass in each region , @xmath60.01m@xmath26 , is consistent with our previous estimates @xcite , and is comparable with typical ofmks in the remnant @xcite .",
    "the _ xmm - newton _ rgs allowed successful measurements of accurate doppler velocities of two x - ray  emitting ejecta features ( i.e. , the ejecta knot and the ejecta filament ) in the ne quadrant of puppis  a. in our spectral analysis , we divided each feature into four cross - dispersion regions .",
    "the error - weighted mean doppler velocities for the four regions are obtained to be 1480@xmath3140@xmath360  blueward for the ejecta knot and 650@xmath370@xmath360  redward for the ejecta filament , where the first and second term errors , respectively , represent the standard deviation for the four regions and a wavelengths accuracy of the rgs .",
    "the doppler velocity of the ejecta knot is fully consistent with previous optical measurements for the @xmath2 filament @xcite , ensuring robustness of our measurements .",
    "the rgs spectra also enabled , for the first time , to measure broadening of o ( and ne ) k - shell lines of the ejecta knot .",
    "the broadening is found to be modest , @xmath4ev at  ly@xmath0 , indicating an upper limit of an oxygen temperature of 30kev .",
    "as far as we know , this is the second result that we were able to measure an oxygen temperature of fast - moving ejecta knots in x - rays . comparing our results with the first successful object , a comparably fast - moving ejecta knot in the northwestern rim of sn  1006",
    ", we notice that the oxygen temperature in puppis  a s knot is at least an order - of - magnitude lower than that in sn  1006 s knot ( @xmath27300kev : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the post - shock temperature , @xmath28 , for species @xmath29 with mass @xmath30 right behind a collisionless shock in the absence of the magnetic pressure is given as ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath31 for shock velocity , @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the particles will have mass - proportional temperatures in the limit of collisionless plasma .",
    "in fact , the high oxygen temperature together with a relatively low electron temperature of @xmath61.5kev in sn  1006 has been reasonably interpreted as evidence for temperature nonequilibration between ions and electrons after collisionless shock heating . as for puppis  a s knot",
    ", the oxygen temperature is expected to be @xmath6130kev , if we assume that the shock velocity is similar to the gas velocity : @xmath33derived by the doppler velocity of @xmath34and the optical proper motion of @xmath61250  at a distance of 2.2kpc @xcite .",
    "this prediction conflicts with our measurement , @xmath3530kev .    to understand the apparent temperature inconsistency between the measurement and the simple prediction above , we are required to inspect heating processes at the collisionless shocks . in fact , it is well known that temperatures measured in the immediate post - shock regions do not often obey equation [ eq : init_temp ] ( * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) . the deviation may be due to plasma processes that raise an electron temperature at ( in front of ) the shock @xcite and/or significant energy leakage into cosmic rays that lowers post - shock temperatures of all particle species @xcite . in any case",
    ", oxygen can have a lower temperature than that predicted by equation [ eq : init_temp ] .    in this context , it is important to clarify whether the @xmath36/@xmath37 ratio observed in puppis  a s knot can be explained by temperature equilibration due to coulomb interactions behind a collisionless shock or requires other scenarios . to this end , assuming pure collisionless shock heating , i.e. , initial temperatures are given by equation [ eq : init_temp ] , we solve the following temperature equilibration due to coulomb interactions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath38 for species @xmath29 and @xmath39 with atomic numbers @xmath40 and @xmath41 , charges @xmath42 and @xmath43 , number density @xmath44 , and the coulomb logarithm ln(@xmath45 ) @xmath6 40",
    ". we coupled the differential equations for electrons , protons , he , c , o , ne , mg , si , and fe , using the abundances for either case a ( he / h=1 , c / h = o / h=5 , ne / h=8 , mg / h=7 , si / h=3 , and fe / h=1 times the solar values , see table  [ tab : mosresults ] ) or case b ( he / h=1 , c / h = o / h=2000 , ne / h=3000 , mg / h=2500 , si / h=1000 , and fe / h=300 times the solar values ) . after examining several shock velocities , we find that the electron temperatures and ionization timescales in the ejecta knot can be best explained at @xmath46  or @xmath47  for case a or case b , respectively .",
    "the temperature histories for electrons , protons , and oxygen as a function of _ et  are shown in figure  [ fig : temp_equil ] . from the plot",
    ", we also find that the oxygen temperature measured , @xmath48kev , is consistent with the expectation in both cases .",
    "therefore , we do not need to invoke some exotic scenarios to explain the low @xmath49 ratio .",
    "still , the temperatures measured may be also reproduced for the case that initial post - shock temperatures are not proportional to particle masses , as is often observed .",
    "if it is the case , the shock velocities would be different , causing uncertainties on the shock velocity .",
    "recent observational studies agree in that the initial electron - to - proton temperature ratio , @xmath50 , is close to unity ( full equilibration ) for slow shocks ( @xmath51400 ) , but gradually goes down for faster shocks ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we take the value of @xmath1 to be 0.2 which is typical around @xmath52  @xcite .",
    "we find that temperature histories expected at @xmath53  ( case a ) or @xmath47  ( case b ) , indicated as dotted lines in figure  [ fig : temp_equil ] , best match our measurements . in this context , we argue that the shock velocity does not depend on the degree of initial temperature equilibration compared with the ambiguity of abundances .",
    "it is interesting to note that the inferred shock velocity , 6001200 , is less than the shocked - gas velocity , @xmath33 .",
    "this suggests that the ejecta knot was heated by a reverse shock rather than a forward shock , since the forward shock velocity should be @xmath62500according to the rankine - hugoniot relation : @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are velocities of the forward shock and the shocked gas , respectively , and @xmath57 is the specific heat ratio taken to be 5/3 for a non - relativistic ideal gas .",
    "the rankine - hugoniot relation over the reverse shock can be written down as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are velocities of the freely - expanding ejecta and the reverse shock in the observer s frame .",
    "substituting @xmath61 ( = @xmath32 ) = 6001200 , @xmath62 2000 , and @xmath63 , we compute the value of @xmath59 to be 29002450 , depending on the shock velocity of 6001200 .",
    "this velocity agrees with a typical ejecta velocity in o - rich layer for type iib sn @xcite which is likely the origin of puppis  a @xcite . also , the distance , 0.30.6pc , that the shock of this velocity travels for @xmath6500years ( which is a product of the ionization timescale , 3@xmath643s , divided by the electron density , 2@xmath22 , as in tables  [ tab : mosresults ] and [ tab : dens_mass ] ) is comparable with the size of the knot ( @xmath60.6pc ) , showing self - consistency of our interpretation .",
    "we comment on the remarkable difference in @xmath49 between puppis  a s knot and sn  1006 s knot . the proper motion of sn  1006 s knot is measured from recent x - ray observations to be @xmath63000   @xcite .",
    "provided that it is shocked by a forward shock , then the shock velocity would be the proper motion itself .",
    "on the other hand , if it is shocked by a reverse shock , the proper motion should be the velocity of the shocked gas .",
    "also , freely - expanding ejecta velocities is likely @xmath610000  @xcite , since there is a general consensus that sn  1006 is a type ia snr .",
    "this is indeed comparable to a freely - expanding si - rich ejecta velocity of @xmath67000  measured by the uv absorption edge @xcite as well as a simple estimate from the radius at the knot ( @xmath69pc ) and the snr age ( @xmath61000yr ) .",
    "then , equation  [ eq : rs_rankine ] gives the reverse shock velocity in the ejecta - rest frame to be @xmath69300(or @xmath65300 , if we take @xmath59 to be 7000 ) .",
    "therefore , the shock velocities estimated for sn  1006 s knot are at least a few times faster than that for puppis  a knot .",
    "in addition , the ionization timescale is an order - of - magnitude lower in sn  1006 s knot than in puppis  a knot .",
    "these differences can qualitatively explain the different oxygen temperatures .",
    "future high - resolution x - ray spectroscopy with the nondispersive soft x - ray spectrometer onboard astro - h ( fwhm@xmath65ev : * ? ? ?",

    "hopefully , we will be able to measure ion temperatures in different ionization states for every species .",
    "such information will significantly improve our understanding on temperature equilibration for fast collisionless shocks .",
    "one particularly interesting target in puppis  a would be the si - rich clump in the ne remnant @xcite , for which the rgs can not produce high - resolution spectra due to its large angular size ( 3@xmath65 ) .",
