    "<S> topological phases of matter exhibit phase transitions between distinct topological classes . </S>",
    "<S> these phase transitions are exotic in that they do not fall within the traditional ginzburg - landau paradigm but are instead associated with changes in bulk topological invariants and associated topological surface states . in the case of a weyl semimetal </S>",
    "<S> this phase transition is particularly unusual because it involves the creation of bulk chiral charges and the nucleation of topological fermi arcs . </S>",
    "<S> here we image a topological phase transition to a weyl semimetal in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  with changing composition @xmath3 . using pump - probe ultrafast angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( pump - probe arpes ) </S>",
    "<S> , we directly observe the nucleation of a topological fermi arc at @xmath4 , showing the critical point of a topological weyl phase transition . for mo dopings @xmath5 </S>",
    "<S> , we observe no fermi arc , while for @xmath6 , the fermi arc gradually extends as the bulk weyl points separate . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate for the first time the creation of magnetic monopoles in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> our work opens the way to manipulating chiral charge and topological fermi arcs in weyl semimetals for transport experiments and device applications .    </S>",
    "<S> topological phases of matter exhibit topological phase transitions ( tpts ) which are remarkably different from phase transitions in the ginzburg - landau paradigm . </S>",
    "<S> traditional ginzburg - landau phase transitions are typically associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking and the development of a local , continuous - valued order parameter . by contrast , tpts do not break any symmetry and correspond to a change in a global topological index which typically takes on discrete values . </S>",
    "<S> perhaps the most famous example of a tpt is the quantum hall effect , observed in 1980 , where the hall conductivity transitions from one quantized plateau to the next under changing magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> more recently , a tpt was observed from a trivial insulator to a @xmath7 topological insulator in bitl(s@xmath8se@xmath9)@xmath2 @xcite . in that experiment , </S>",
    "<S> angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) provided a striking example of a bulk band gap closing and re - opening as a function of @xmath10 , with direct observation of a gapless dirac cone surface state crossing the bulk band gap in the topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> all tpts so far , including these two examples , have been observed as a phase transition from one bulk insulating phase to another . </S>",
    "<S> however , the discovery of the first weyl semimetal has set the stage for the first tpt to a gapless phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , for a tpt to a weyl semimetal , the bulk band gap closes and then splits into weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> this phase transition is fascinating because the nucleation of weyl points corresponds to the creation of chiral charge , or equivalently , the creation of magnetic monopoles in momentum space @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this transition is also associated with the development of a topological fermi arc surface state which similarly nucleates from the bulk band gap closing and connects the weyl points in the surface brillouin zone , extending across the surface as the weyl points move apart in the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> there may further arise unusual behavior at the critical point , where in generic cases the bulk band touching does not occur at a time - reversal invariant momentum and where the form of the dispersion at the critical degeneracy point is constrained by the requirement that it carry no net chiral charge . despite these fascinating properties , to date a topological phase transition to a weyl semimetal </S>",
    "<S> has yet to be realized .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , it was predicted in _ ab initio _ calculation that mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  is a tunable weyl semimetal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was concurrently predicted that the end compound wte@xmath2 hosts a novel type of strongly lorentz - violating , or type ii , weyl fermion @xcite , with related predictions following for mote@xmath2 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it became clear that both of these end compounds lie close to a topological phase transition , so that calculation could not conclusively predict the topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> considerable experimental efforts then provided evidence for a weyl semimetal in mote@xmath2 , although no evidence or discussion was presented regarding the topological phase transition in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here we use pump - probe angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( pump - probe arpes ) to carry out a systematic study of the mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  series from @xmath11 to @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> we directly access the topological fermi arc above the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> we find that undoped wte@xmath2 is topologically trivial and we directly observe a topological phase transition from a topologically trivial phase to a weyl semimetal in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  by changing @xmath3 , with @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we perform novel _ ab initio _ calculations to pinpoint the topological phase transition in numerics and we find excellent agreement with our experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> we directly demonstrate the first topological phase transition between a trivial semimetal and a weyl semimetal .    </S>",
    "<S> we first provide an overview of the crystal and electronic structure of mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the creation of chiral charge can be understood as a process of gap closing or band inversion , fig . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1]f . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal structure breaks inversion symmetry , so generically we expect weyl points to arise where the bands overlap . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed _ ab initio _ calculation shows that for most @xmath3 , mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  hosts 8 weyl points near @xmath13 which lie on @xmath14 , at @xmath15 and at energies @xmath16 ev above @xmath17 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]g , h @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , calculation predicts that as @xmath3 varies , the weyl points move : for @xmath18 the system is in a trivial phase without weyl points ; at @xmath19 the bands intersect and nucleate weyl points in four pairs of @xmath20 and @xmath21 , giving a phase with 8 weyl points ; for @xmath22 the @xmath20 and @xmath21 separate out ; at @xmath23 the @xmath20 meet up at @xmath24 and annihilate ; leaving the system in a phase with 4 weyl points for @xmath25 . in the 8 weyl point phase , </S>",

    "<S> next , we show a topological phase transition in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> in pump - probe arpes , we use a @xmath26 ev pump laser to first excite electrons into unoccupied electron states and then we use a @xmath27 ev probe laser to perform photoemission on the excited electrons , granting direct access in experiment to the unoccupied band structure </S>",

    "<S> [ fig2]a - f . for compositions </S>",
    "<S> @xmath32 we observe a short , bright band extending above @xmath17 ( purple curve ) , with dimmer bands on either side ( green curve ) . </S>",

    "<S> we also see the bright band grow in length systematically with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the bright bands as disjoint fermi arcs connecting weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> this interpretation is consistent with the locations of weyl points in calculation . </S>",
    "<S> also , the high spectral weight suggests a surface state well - localized at the surface , while the dimmer states suggest hybridization with the bulk . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , the increase in length of the fermi arc with @xmath3 is consistent with increasing separation of the weyl points for heavier mo doping . at @xmath33 , we see no fermi arc , but find a bright spot ( purple arrow ) and at @xmath11 we find a large smooth band without any particular features ( green curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the bright spot as the nucleation of a topological fermi arc , signalling that at @xmath34 the system is at the critical point for a topological phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret the large band at @xmath11 as a signature of a topologically trivial phase in undoped wte@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that this evolution of the band structure is consistent and robust regardless of whether samples were grown by a flux technique or chemical vapor transport ( cvt ) ; regardless of whether i@xmath2 or tei@xmath35 was used as the transport agent in cvt growth ; and despite differences in heating temperatures and durations , see the methods section in the supplementary materials for additional details . </S>",
    "<S> we further interpret our results as the weyl points `` snipping '' a fermi arc out of a trivial surface state . </S>",
    "<S> wte@xmath2 is in a trivial phase , with a large trivial electron - like surface state , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]g . at the critical point , </S>",
    "<S> the bulk band gap closes on or near the trivial surface state , fig . </S>",

    "<S> then , in the weyl semimetal phase , the weyl points separate out , threading a fermi arc and erasing the trivial surface state [ fig2]i , j. although only the topological fermi arc terminates strictly on the weyl points , the trivial surface state still merges into the bulk very close to the weyl points , so that within the linewidth and resolution of our measurement , we still see that the topological and trivial arc connect . </S>",
    "<S> however , we observe that they meet at slightly different slopes , forming a kink in the surface state bands which demonstrates a weyl semimetal . by directly observing the nucleation of a topological fermi arc and its systematic evolution with increasing mo doping @xmath3 , we demonstrate a topological phase transition from a trivial phase to a weyl semimetal in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we perform novel _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> calculations on the mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  series and for the first time we pinpoint the topological phase transition in numerics . </S>",
    "<S> we find that our calculations directly support our experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> first , we find excellent agreement in wte@xmath2 between the band structure in pump - probe arpes and calculation both above and below the fermi level , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a and fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a . specifically , we find two electron - like pockets above @xmath36 , a hole pocket below @xmath36 as well as the broad hole - like bulk continuum extending to @xmath37 ev above @xmath36 , all consistent between experiment and theory . </S>",
    "<S> we also find excellent agreement for other compositions @xmath3 , for other measurement photon energies , and for constant energy @xmath29-@xmath38 surfaces as well as for @xmath28-@xmath29 cuts , see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that both the energy and momentum separation of the @xmath20 and @xmath21 increase with @xmath3 in both experiment and theory , figs [ fig3]b , c. next , we zoom in near the weyl points ( red rectangle in [ fig3]a ) and study the band structure with increasing mo , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d . for wte@xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the bulk valence and conduction bands have an indirect gap . at very small mo doping , @xmath39 , the bands touch , and for larger </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 , the bands invert and give rise to two weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> consistent with pump - probe arpes , while wte@xmath2 hosts a large trivial surface state , for larger @xmath3 the weyl points snip out a topological fermi arc . </S>",
    "<S> we find that calculation reproduces all aspects of our pump - probe arpes data , but likely underestimates the size of the trivial gap in wte@xmath2 because the topological phase transition occurs around @xmath40 in experiment while it occurs for exceedingly small @xmath3 in calculation . at the same time , the calculation systematically underestimates the separation of the weyl points at @xmath41 . </S>",
    "<S> this is perhaps reasonable because the calculation for arbitrary doping @xmath3 uses an interpolation of wannier models which is expected to be most accurate for small deviations from stoichiometric wte@xmath2 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we study systematic pump - probe arpes spectra to provide further evidence for a topological phase transition in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we study @xmath28-@xmath29 cuts of @xmath42 at different @xmath38 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a - c . for stoichiometric wte@xmath2 , </S>",
    "<S> our data shows that the trivial surface state is unbroken and no signature of a fermi arc or critical point appears at any @xmath38 , again confirming that wte@xmath2 is in a robust trivial phase . at @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> , we can identify the critical point ( purple arrow ) in the spectra with a range of @xmath38 . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , we can identify a single @xmath30 , center panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]b , where the critical point is brightest , as expected since the bulk bands strictly meet at a single point in momentum space . </S>",
    "<S> away from the special value of @xmath43 , the critical point broadens and fades . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , at @xmath44 , we can directly follow the dispersion of the fermi arc in @xmath38 ( endpoints marked by red and blue arrows ) . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm that the length of the arc remains consistent as we sweep through @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> we show analogous systematics for all other compositions in the supplementary materials . </S>",
    "<S> we also use these results to measure the fermi velocity of the weyl cones along certain directions by mapping out the attachment curves of the fermi arcs to the bulk bands , see also the supplementary materials . </S>",
    "<S> our systematic pump - probe arpes spectra confirm that we have observed a topological phase transition in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> we summarize our results on a phase diagram for mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]a . </S>",
    "<S> we discover that the mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  series includes a trivial phase under low doping @xmath45 and a phase with 8 weyl points beyond @xmath46 . while we include mote@xmath2 ( @xmath47 ) in our phase diagram , we emphasize that in calculation mote@xmath2 is also close to a critical point , like wte@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> recent works predict either a weyl semimetal with 4 or 8 weyl points in mote@xmath2 , as indicated by the hashed box around @xmath48 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]a , although recent experimental works appear to lean toward the 8 weyl point case . </S>",
    "<S> next , we can place our result in perspective by comparing it with the phase transition to a topological insulator , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]b , c. in the same way that the transition to a topological insulator threads a dirac cone surface state through the bulk band gap , here we observe how a transition to a weyl semimetal threads a topological fermi arc surface state across the surface brillouin zone . by directly observing the nucleation of a topological fermi arc </S>",
    "<S> , we have demonstrated the first topological phase transition to a weyl semimetal . </S>",
    "<S> our discovery also provides the first demonstration of the nucleation of chiral charge in a real material . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the tunability demonstrated here has never been observed in a weyl semimetal and may be relevant to applications , especially since our results indicate that certain weyl points sit very close to the fermi level in mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  for a wide range of @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> our work represents a fundamental advance in the study of topological phases and presents new potential for applications based on a weyl semimetal tunable through the topological phase transition . </S>"
