    "one of the most important discoveries that stemmed from the relativistic heavy ion collision program was the discovery that the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in these reactions behaves as a relativistic fluid for which viscous effects appear to be very small @xcite .",
    "the large degree of collectivity evidenced by the fourier harmonics of the flow are compatible @xcite with viscous hydrodynamic calculations in which the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio , @xmath5 , nears the uncertainty principle estimate @xmath6 danielewicz:1984ww , kovtun:2004de .",
    "since @xmath5 becomes much larger than @xmath7 in the high temperature perturbative regime arnold:2000dr , arnold:2003zc and also at sufficiently low temperatures prakash , it was suggested that in qcd this quantity should have a minimum @xmath8 in between these different temperature regimes hirano:2005wx , csernai:2006zz .",
    "further support to this idea appeared in @xcite where it was shown that heavy resonances may already considerably lower @xmath5 in the hadronic phase .    while relativistic hydrodynamical studies that include shear viscous corrections are currently considered to be the state of the art in the field @xcite",
    "there is a priori no reason that effects from bulk viscosity @xmath9 should not also be included in the description of the time evolution of the qgp .",
    "high temperature perturbative qcd calculations @xcite show that @xmath10 vanishes as @xmath11 for massless quarks and , thus , it becomes negligible in comparison to @xmath12 in this regime ( recent calculations of @xmath10 in a pion gas performed in the regime @xmath13 can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "given the multitude of mass states present in qcd at intermediate temperatures in the hadronic phase and the maximal violation of conformal invariance observed in lattice simulations when @xmath14 mev @xcite , it has been suggested that @xmath10 may display a peak in the same temperature region @xcite .",
    "it is not clear at the moment if such a peak exists in qcd , though model calculations have given support to this idea @xcite and some of its phenomenological consequences in heavy ion collisions have already been investigated torrieri:2007fb , torrieri:2008ip , basar:2012bp .",
    "the effects of bulk viscosity in hydrodynamic simulations of the qgp have not been investigated as thoroughly as in the case of shear viscosity .",
    "hydrodynamical calculations that have used nonzero @xmath10 within averaged initial conditions include monnai:2009ad , song:2009rh , bozek:2009dw , denicol:2009am , roy:2011pk , dusling:2011fd while event - by - event simulations have been studied in @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study the effects of bulk viscosity on the fluid - dynamical evolution of the qgp and also at freeze - out on an event - by - event basis .",
    "the effects of bulk viscous pressure on differential collective flow fourier coefficients @xmath15@xmath16 are computed .",
    "furthermore , a new formula for the bulk viscous corrections in the distribution function at freeze - out is derived starting from the boltzmann equation for multi - particle hadron species .",
    "our calculations show that differential collective flow fourier coefficients from @xmath15 to @xmath16 are enhanced by bulk viscosity , in the range of @xmath17 gev even when @xmath10 is significantly smaller than @xmath18 .",
    "previously , this was only known to occur to @xmath15 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the interplay between shear and bulk viscosities in the evolution and freeze - out of the qgp will be investigated in a forthcoming paper .",
    "the calculations presented in this work were performed using a new relativistic hydrodynamics numerical code called viscous ultrarelativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( v - usphydro ) . in this code the equations of 2 + 1 ( i.e , boost invariant ) relativistic viscous hydrodynamics are solved using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) lagrangian algorithm originally developed in @xcite and later adapted in @xcite for applications in heavy ion collisions .",
    "sph is a mesh free algorithm widely used in several different applications of fluid dynamics that range from cosmology @xcite to engineering @xcite .",
    "standard grid - based , eulerian algorithms are known to become very time consuming and eventually run into problems when dealing with fluid dynamical problems involving free surfaces , deformable boundaries , and extremely large deformations @xcite .",
    "given the extremely rapid time evolution and the large gradients that appear in event by event simulations of qgp , it is conceivable that mesh free methods such as sph can be instrumental in solving the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics in heavy ion collision applications .",
    "in fact , this algorithm has been the basis for the hydrodynamic part of the well - known nexspherio code aguiar:2000hw , osada:2001hw , aguiar:2001ac , socolowski:2004hw , hama:2004rr , hama:2005dz , andrade:2006yh , andrade:2008xh , takahashi:2009na , derradidesouza:2011rp , gardim:2011xv , gardim:2012yp , gardim:2012im . however , an important distinction between v - usphydro and nexspherio , besides the assumption of boost invariant dynamics made in v - usphydro , is that viscous effects in the hydrodynamical evolution and freeze - out are included in v - usphydro .",
    "the details of the code and the tests made to confirm its accuracy are presented in several appendices .",
    "_ definitions _ : our metric signature in minkowski space - time is mostly minus , i.e. , @xmath19 and we use natural units @xmath20 .",
    "we employ greek indices for the 4-vectors , e.g , the 4-momentum is @xmath21 , space - time coordinates are @xmath22 , the flow field @xmath23 , while we use bold letters for vectors in the transverse plane , e.g. , @xmath24 , and latin indices for the components @xmath25 .",
    "the scalar product among 4-vectors is denoted as @xmath26 while for spatial vectors we have @xmath27 . throughout this paper",
    "we will be using hyperbolic coordinates @xmath28 defined by @xmath29the metric in hyperbolic coordinates is @xmath30 while the boost invariant configuration for the flow is @xmath31 and , thus , @xmath32 .",
    "we assume a vanishing baryon chemical potential and thus investigate only the equations of motion that stem from energy and momentum conservation within a boost invariant setup .",
    "the conservation of energy and momentum is given by @xmath33where @xmath34 and the christoffel symbol is @xmath35the most general expression for the energy - momentum tensor ( in the absence of shear viscosity effects ) is @xmath36where @xmath37 is the bulk viscous pressure and the spatial projector is @xmath38 . above",
    ", we use the landau definition for the local rest frame , @xmath39 .",
    "the remaining dynamical quantities are the energy density @xmath40 , the pressure @xmath41 , and the fluid 4-velocity @xmath23 .",
    "besides energy - momentum conservation , one also needs to specify the differential equation obeyed by @xmath37 . in this paper",
    "we employ the simplest second order formulation of the fluid dynamical equations of motion that can be causal and stable @xmath42where @xmath43 is the comoving covariant derivative , @xmath44 is the fluid expansion rate , @xmath9 is the bulk viscosity , and @xmath45 is the relaxation time coefficient required to preserve causality ( see , e.g. , the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "equation  ( [ eqn : hydro3 ] ) is discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "note that the differential equation for @xmath37 in ( [ eqn : hydro3 ] ) includes the nonlinear term @xmath46 . for a full derivation of the equations of motion using the method of moments for the boltzmann equation including the numerous other terms that enter at that order the reader is referred to denicol:2012cn . in this paper",
    "viscous effects associated with bulk viscosity are encoded in only 2 transport coefficients , but the inclusion of the remaining terms is straightforward and is left for a future work .    fluid - dynamical evolution can be described using either the eulerian or the lagrangian approach .",
    "eulerian methods require the presence of a grid where the hydrodynamical fields are defined while in lagrangian methods the flow is described following the trajectory of fluid particles \" and one can consistently rephrase the field equations in this language . in cosmology applications ,",
    "lagrangian methods have become largely employed because they allow for quick computational times and avoid other limitations that are inherent to grid - based methods .",
    "currently , in heavy ion collisions almost all hydrodynamical codes are written in the eulerian formulation with the exception of the lagrangian - based codes in aguiar:2000hw , nonaka:2006yn , denicol:2009am . the sph formulation of the equations of motion ( [ eqn : hydro]-[eqn : hydro3 ] )",
    "is reviewed in appendix [ appendixsph ] .",
    "since the results of this paper are based on a new relativistic fluid dynamics simulation , we describe tests made to the algorithm in appendix [ appendixsph ] and [ sec : convh ] .    in the following",
    ", we shall always assume the bjorken scaling solution for the longitudinal direction , in which the component of the velocity field in the longitudinal direction ( in hyperbolic coordinates ) is set to zero , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "as in any hydrodynamical modeling of heavy ion collisions , there are a number of free parameters that must be fixed . the initial time to start the fluid - dynamical evolution",
    "is fixed to be @xmath48 fm .",
    "the initial conditions for the hydrodynamic simulations are taken from a monte carlo glauber code @xcite in which the initial energy density is given in the form @xmath49where @xmath50 is the number density of binary collisions in the event and the constant @xmath51 is fixed to describe the final multiplicities observed experimentally .",
    "the centrality classes we used are defined in terms of the number of participant nucleons and are in agreement with standard results from other monte carlo glauber simulations @xcite .",
    "we assumed that for @xmath52 gev rhic s most central collisions at mid - rapidity there are about 300 @xmath53 s @xcite and , since we assume that freeze - out occurs at @xmath54 mev , we estimate that about @xmath55 of pions would come from direct thermal pions @xcite .",
    "thus , the constant @xmath51 was adjusted for the ideal case using an average 0 - 5@xmath56 most central rhic event so that we obtain @xmath57 @xmath53 s when @xmath58 mev .",
    "note that when bulk viscosity is included the total entropy of the system increases in time and , in order to keep the total number of pions at freeze - out the same as before , one has to slightly reduce @xmath51 . here , we assume that @xmath37 and the spatial components of @xmath23 vanish at @xmath59 .     initial conditions that include the effects of gluon saturation , such as those in @xcite , can also be studied using v - usphydro .",
    "however , this type of initial conditions displays structure on smaller length scales than that of the usual glauber initial conditions and , thus , smaller values of the smoothing parameter @xmath60 ( more on that below ) must be used to systematically investigate the difference created in the flow harmonics due to gluon saturation effects at early times .",
    "we use the lattice - based equation of state from @xcite with chemical equilibrium .",
    "we have tested the dependence of our results with the choice for the equation of state by using the equation of state from fodor et al .",
    "@xcite which , however , led to no noticeable difference in the flow harmonics .",
    "the results shown in this paper were computed using eos s95n - v1 @xcite ( for @xmath61 mev this eos is matched to that of a massive gas of pions ) .",
    "the bulk viscosity coefficient is parametrized in the following way @xmath62where @xmath63 is the entropy density and @xmath64 is the speed of sound . as one can see in fig .  1",
    ", @xmath10 is significantly smaller than the standard value of @xmath65 .",
    "additionally , because of the dip in the speed of sound , there is a peak in @xmath10 between @xmath66 mev .",
    "this formula for the bulk viscosity is inspired by buchel s formula obtained within the gauge / gravity duality @xcite .",
    "calculations performed in @xcite showed that at sufficiently large @xmath67 in the qgp phase the bulk viscosity in qcd follows the relation @xmath68 .",
    "the specific functional form of @xmath69 does not make a significant difference in our results as long as the overall magnitude is the same .",
    "the temperature dependence of the relaxation time , @xmath45 , is described by the formula found in @xcite @xmath70and shown in fig .  1 . clearly , other choices for @xmath45 are possible but , for simplicity , in this paper we fix it as above .",
    "we chose a time step @xmath71 fm in our numerical simulations and @xmath45 is set to never be smaller than @xmath72 ( this is why @xmath73 plateaus when @xmath74 gev ) . also , the time step is considerably smaller than @xmath75 , as required to resolve the gradients in the longitudinal direction .",
