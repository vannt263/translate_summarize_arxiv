    "this paper fully describes the sequences given by the non - autonomous second order lyness difference equations @xmath4 where @xmath2 is a @xmath5-periodic sequence taking positive values , @xmath6 and the initial conditions @xmath3 are as well positive .",

    "3-periodic ) .",
    "moreover it is possible by algebraic tools to distinguish which is the situation .",
    "our approach to describe the sequences @xmath0 is based on the study of the natural dynamical system associated to ( [ eq ] ) and on the results of @xcite .",
    "the main tool that allows to distinguish the number of intervals for the adherence of the sequences @xmath0 is the computation of several resultants , see section  [ provaa ] .",
    "it is worth to comment that theorem  [ main ] is an extension of what happens in the classical case @xmath16 .",
    "there , the same result holds but in statement ( b ) only appears one interval .",
    "our second main result will prove that there are other more significative differences between the case @xmath16 and the cases @xmath17 these differences are related with the lack of monotonicity of certain rotation number functions associated to the dynamical systems given by the lyness recurrences , see theorem  [ teonomonotonia ] .",
    "the behaviors of these rotation number functions are important for the understanding of the recurrences , because they give the possible periods for them , see @xcite .",

    "we explore in more detail the differences between the cases @xmath20 and @xmath21    this paper is organized as follows : section  [ ds ] presents the difference equations that we are studying as discrete dynamical systems and we state our main results on them , see theorems  [ rotacions ] and [ teonomonotonia ]",
    ". section  [ pt2 ] is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ rotacions ] . by using it , in section  [ provaa ] , we prove theorem  [ main ] and we give some examples of how to apply it to determine the number of closed intervals of the adherence of @xmath0 . in section  [ someproperties ]",
    "we demonstrate theorem  [ teonomonotonia ] and we also present some examples where we study in more detail the rotation number function of the dynamical systems associated to .",
    "in this section we reduce the study of the sequence @xmath0 to the study of some discrete dynamical systems and we state our main results on them .",

    "we have that @xmath43 is a first integral for @xmath44 and @xmath45 is a first integral for @xmath46 .",
    "the topology of the level sets of these integrals in @xmath36 as well as the dynamics of the maps restricted to them is described by the following result , that will be proved in section  [ pt2 ] .",
    "[ rotacions ]    * the level sets of @xmath47 ( resp .",

    "@xmath46 ) on each level set of @xmath47 ( resp .",
    "@xmath48 ) contained in @xmath49 is conjugated to a rotation of the circle .",
    "once a result like the above one is established the study of the possible periods of the sequences @xmath0 given by ( [ eq ] ) is quite standard .",
    "it suffices , first to get the rotation interval , which is the open interval formed by all the rotation numbers given by the above theorem , varying the level sets of the first integrals .",
    "afterwards , it suffices to find which are the denominators of all the irreducible rational numbers that belong to the corresponding interval , see @xcite .",
    "the study of the rotation number of these kind of rational maps is not an easy task , see again @xcite . in particular , in @xcite was proved that the rotation number function parameterized by the energy levels of the lyness map @xmath51 is always monotonous , solving a conjecture of zeeman given in @xcite , see also @xcite .",
    "as far as we know , in this paper we give the first simple example for which this rotation number function is neither constant nor monotonous .",
    "we prove :    [ teonomonotonia ] there are positive values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , such that the rotation number function @xmath54 of @xmath44 associated to the closed ovals of @xmath55 has a local maximum .    hence , apart from the known behaviors for the autonomous lyness maps , that is global periodicity or monotonicity of the rotation number function , which trivially holds for @xmath56 taking for instance @xmath57 or @xmath58 respectively , there appear more complicated behaviors for the rotation number function .",
    "our proof of this result relies on the study of lower and upper bounds for the rotation number of @xmath44 on a given oval of a level set of @xmath47 given for some @xmath59 and @xmath60 for @xmath61 .",
    "this can be done because the map on this oval is conjugated to a rotation and it is possible to use an algebraic manipulator to follow and to order a finite number iterates on it , which are also given by points with rational coordinates .",
    "so , only exact arithmetic is used .",
    "a similar study could be done for @xmath46 .",

    "the orbits of @xmath44 and @xmath46 lie on the level sets @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "these level sets can be seen as the algebraic curves given by @xmath64 and @xmath65 respectively .",
    "taking homogeneous coordinates on the projective plane @xmath66 both curves @xmath67 and @xmath68 have the form @xmath69    in order to find the branches of them tending to infinity , we examine the directions of approach to infinity ( @xmath70 ) in the local charts determined by @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively .    in the local chart given by @xmath71 ,",
    "the curve @xmath73 writes as @xmath74 and it meets the straight line at infinity @xmath70 when @xmath75 since for both curves @xmath67 and @xmath68 the coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath77 are positive , the only intersection point that could give points in @xmath36 is @xmath78 the algebraic curve @xmath73 arrives to @xmath79 tangentially to the line @xmath80 since for both curves , @xmath67 and @xmath81 the coefficients @xmath76 and @xmath82 are also positive , we have that the branches of the level sets tending to infinity are not included in  @xmath83    an analogous study can be made in the chart given by @xmath84 obtaining the same conclusions .",
    "moreover , it can be easily checked that in the affine plane both curves @xmath67 and @xmath68 do not intersect the part of the axes @xmath85 and @xmath86 which is in the boundary of @xmath36 .    in summary , there are no branches of the curves @xmath67 and @xmath68 tending to infinity or crossing the axes @xmath85 and @xmath86 in @xmath87 , and therefore the connected components of @xmath88 for @xmath89 are bounded .",
    "notice that this result in particular already implies the persistence of the sequences given by .",
    "consider @xmath90 .",
    "we claim the following facts :    a.   in @xmath36 , the set of fixed points of @xmath44 and the set of singular points of @xmath91 coincide and they only contain the point @xmath92 .",
    "b.   the function @xmath93 has a local minimum at @xmath50 .",
    "we remark that item ( b ) is already known .",
    "we present a new simple proof for the sake of completeness .    from the above claims and the fact that the connected components of the level sets of @xmath47 in @xmath36 are bounded it follows that the level sets of @xmath47 in @xmath94 are diffeomorphic to circles .",
    "let us prove the above claims .",
    "the fixed points of @xmath44 are given by    @xmath95 and so @xmath96 hence in @xmath97 we have that @xmath98 and the above system is equivalent to @xmath99 it is not difficult to check that the last system of equations is precisely the one that gives the critical points of the curves @xmath100 moreover , from the first equation it is necessary that @xmath101 and hence @xmath102 since @xmath103 has only one real root in @xmath104 the uniqueness of the critical point holds .",
    "let us prove that this critical point corresponds with a local minimum of @xmath105 we will check the usual sufficient conditions given by the hessian of @xmath47 at @xmath50 .",
    "firstly , @xmath106 secondly , the determinant of the hessian matrix at the points @xmath107 is @xmath108 where @xmath109 a tedious computation shows that @xmath110 with @xmath111 observe that if @xmath112 is the positive root of @xmath103 , then @xmath113 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath114 implies that @xmath115 we have that @xmath116 so , @xmath117 since @xmath118 @xmath119 and , on this interval , there is only one critical point of @xmath120 which is simple , we get that @xmath121 and so @xmath122 hence @xmath123 is a local minimum of @xmath124 , as we wanted to prove .",
    "the same kind of arguments work to end the proof for the case @xmath24 but the computations are extremely more tedious .",
    "we only make some comments .",
    "the fixed points of @xmath46 in @xmath87 are given by : @xmath125 it can be proved again that they coincide with the singular points of @xmath48 in @xmath83 this fact follows from the computation of several suitable resultants between @xmath126 @xmath127 and @xmath128    the uniqueness of the fixed point @xmath50 in @xmath36 can be shown as follows : since @xmath129 implies that @xmath130 , we only need to search solutions of @xmath131 in @xmath132 . with the new variable @xmath133 @xmath134 since @xmath135 ; @xmath136 ; and the descarte s rule , we know that there is only one positive solution , as we wanted to see .",

    "we prefer our approach because it provides a dynamical interpretation of the rotation number together with its analytic characterization .",

    "secondly , in this later case , we provide an algebraic way for studying the actual number of intervals .    *",
    "first step : * we start with the case @xmath33 with the notation introduced in , it holds that @xmath182 where @xmath183 and @xmath184 .",
    "so the odd terms of the sequence @xmath0 are contained in the projection on the @xmath185-axis of the oval of @xmath186 and the even terms in the corresponding projection of @xmath187 , where notice that we have used lemma  [ elemental ] .",
    "recall that the ovals of @xmath47 are invariant by @xmath44 and the ovals of @xmath188 are invariant by @xmath189 .",
    "notice also that the trivial equality @xmath190 implies that the action of @xmath44 on @xmath191 is conjugated to the action of @xmath189 on @xmath192 via @xmath193    from theorem [ rotacions ] we know that @xmath44 on the corresponding oval is conjugated to a rotation of the circle .",
    "hence , if the corresponding rotation number is rational , then the orbit starting at @xmath194 is periodic , of period say @xmath195 then the sequence @xmath0 is @xmath196-periodic . on the other hand",
    "if the rotation number is irrational , then the orbit of @xmath194 generated by @xmath44 fulfills densely the oval of @xmath191 in @xmath36 and hence the subsequence of odd terms also fulfills densely the projection of @xmath191 in the @xmath185-axis .",
    "clearly , the sequence of even terms do the same with the projection of the oval of @xmath197    similarly when @xmath38 the equalities @xmath198 where @xmath199 , allow to conclude that each term @xmath200 of the sequence @xmath0 where we use the notation ( [ k=3 ] ) , is contained in one of the projections on the @xmath185-axis of the ovals @xmath201 and @xmath202 and @xmath203 , according with the remainder of @xmath204 after dividing it by 3 .",
    "the rest of the proof in this case follows as in the case @xmath33 so the first step is done .",
    "* second step : * from the above results it is clear that the problem of knowing the number of connected components of the adherence of @xmath0 is equivalent to the control of the projections of several invariant ovals on the @xmath185-axis .",
    "the strategy for @xmath38 , and analogously for @xmath90 , is the following .",
    "consider the ovals contained in the level sets given by @xmath205 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 and denote by @xmath206 and @xmath207 the corresponding closed intervals of @xmath208 given by their projections on the @xmath185-axis .",
    "we want to detect the values of @xmath209 for which two of the intervals , among @xmath210 and @xmath211 have exactly one common point .",
    "first we seek their boundaries .",
    "since the level sets are given by cubic curves , that are quadratic with respect the @xmath212-variable , these points will correspond with values of @xmath185 for which the discriminant of the quadratic equation with respect to @xmath212 is zero .",
    "so , we compute @xmath213 now we have to search for relations among @xmath214 and @xmath209 for which two of these three functions have some common solution , @xmath215 these relations can be obtained by computing some suitable resultants .    taking the resultants of @xmath216 and @xmath217 ; @xmath217 and @xmath218 ; and @xmath216 and @xmath218 with respect @xmath185 we obtain three polynomial equations @xmath219 , @xmath220 and @xmath221 in short , once @xmath41 and @xmath11 are fixed we have obtained three polynomials in @xmath209 such that a subset of their zeroes give the bifurcation values which separate the number of intervals of the adherence of @xmath0 .",

    "we plot around six hundred steps , after skipping the first fifty ones . by taking 1000 points",
    "we get @xmath317 and after 3000 points , @xmath318 in fact when we say that @xmath319 , the value @xmath320 is the upper lower bound obtained by following all the considered points of the orbit , and @xmath321 is the lowest upper bound .",
    "notice that taking 1000 or 3000 points we have obtained the same lower bound for @xmath322      _ proof of theorem [ teonomonotonia ] .",
    "_ consider @xmath323 @xmath324 and the three points @xmath325 notice that @xmath326 hence @xmath327 by applying the algorithm described above , using 100 points of each orbit starting at each @xmath328 we obtain that @xmath329 since @xmath330 we have proved that the function @xmath331 has at least a local maximum in @xmath332 from the continuity of the rotation number function , with respect @xmath41 and @xmath209 , we notice that this result also holds for all values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 in a neighborhood of @xmath333          we start by studying with more detail the rotation number function @xmath331 , that we have considered to prove theorem  [ teonomonotonia ] . in this case",
    "the fixed point is @xmath335 and @xmath336 moreover @xmath337 . by applying our algorithm for approximating the rotation number , with @xmath338 points on each orbit",
    ", we obtain the results presented in table  1 . in figure  [ fig3 ]",
    "we also plot the upper and lower bounds of @xmath331 that we have obtained by using a wide range of values of @xmath228            . on the horizontal axis we represent @xmath342 and , on the vertical axis , the value of the rotation number .",
    "notice that for values of @xmath342 smaller that 70 both values are indistinguishable in the figure.,width=14,height=7 ]    for other values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 we obtain different behaviors .",
    "all the experiments are performed by starting at the fixed point @xmath343 and increasing the energy level by taking initial conditions of the form @xmath344 , by decreasing @xmath185 to @xmath307 . with this process",
    "we take orbits approaching to the boundary of @xmath36 , that is lying on level sets of @xmath47 with increasing energy .",
    "the step in the decrease of @xmath185 ( and therefore in the increase of @xmath209 ) is not uniform , and it has been manually tuned making it smaller in those regions where a possible non monotonous behavior could appear .",
    "consider the set of parameters @xmath345 , where notice that we also consider the boundaries @xmath295 or @xmath346 where the map @xmath44 is well defined .",
    "we already know that the rotation number function behaves equal at @xmath347 and @xmath348 moreover we know perfectly its behavior on the diagonal @xmath349 ( when @xmath350 it is monotonous decreasing and when @xmath351 it is monotonous increasing ) and that @xmath352 and @xmath353 hence a good strategy for an numerical exploration can be to produce sequences of experiments using our algorithm by fixing some @xmath354 and varying @xmath53 .",
    "for instance we obtain :    * case @xmath355 for all the values of @xmath356 considered , the rotation number function seems to tend to @xmath357 when @xmath209 goes to infinity .",
    "moreover it seems * * monotone decreasing for @xmath358 * * to have a unique maximum when @xmath359 ; * * monotone increasing for @xmath360 * case @xmath361 for all the values of @xmath356 considered , the rotation number function seems to tend to @xmath362 when @xmath209 goes to infinity .",
    "moreover it seems * * monotone decreasing for @xmath363 ; * * to have a unique maximum when @xmath364 ; * * monotone decreasing for @xmath365 .",
    "the above results , together with some other experiments for other values of @xmath52 and @xmath53 , not detailed in this paper , indicate the existence of a subset of positive measure in @xmath366 where the corresponding rotation number functions seem to present an unique maximum .",
    "this subset probably separates two other subsets of  @xmath366 , one where @xmath54 is monotonically decreasing to @xmath357 , and another one where @xmath54 increases monotonically to the same value .",
    "the `` oscillatory subset '' seems to shrink to @xmath367 when it approaches to the line @xmath368 and seems to finish in one interval on each of the borders @xmath369 and @xmath370 .",
    "further analysis must be done in this direction in order to have a more accurate knowledge of the bifurcation diagram associated to the behavior of @xmath371 on @xmath366 ."
