    "superfluid turbulence consists of a disordered tangle of quantized vortex filaments which move under the velocity field of each other  @xcite . if the temperature , @xmath1 is sufficiently smaller than the critical temperature , @xmath2 , then the normal fluid can be neglected and the vortices do not experience any friction effects  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of the vortex structures ( discrete vortex lines ) makes superfluid turbulence a remarkable fluid system , particularly when compared to turbulence in ordinary fluids .",
    "unfortunately , in contrast with ordinary turbulence , only few experimental techniques of flow visualization and detection of turbulent structures are available in superfluids at very low temperatures .",
    "superfluid turbulence experiments are currently performed in both @xmath3he @xcite and in @xmath0he - b @xcite .",
    "the methods used in these two liquids are different . in superfluid",
    "@xmath0he - b , at temperatures @xmath4 , a powerful experimental technique , based on the andreev scattering of thermal quasiparticle excitations , can be used to detect the vortex filaments , see for example the review article  @xcite .",
    "this technique , having been pioneered and developed at lancaster university  @xcite , is now also used at aalto university in helsinki @xcite for measurements of vortex configurations .",
    "the andreev scattering technique makes use of the fact that the energy dispersion curve , @xmath5 of quasiparticle thermal excitations of momentum @xmath6 is tied to the reference frame of the superfluid . from the galilean invariance it follows that in this reference frame the dispersion curve tilts , becoming @xmath7 @xcite , where @xmath8 is the superfluid velocity .",
    "thus , for thermal excitations whose energies are greater than the fermi energy , @xmath9 ( such excitations are known as quasiparticles ) , one side of the vortex filament presents a potential barrier and they are reflected back almost exactly , becoming quasiholes ( excitations whose energy is smaller than @xmath9 ) ; the other side of the vortex lets the quasiparticles go through .",
    "quasiholes are reflected or transmitted in the opposite way .",
    "the vortex thus casts a symmetric `` andreev '' shadow for the quasiparticles at one side and for the quasiholes at other side , and by measuring the flux of excitations one detects the presence of the vortex .    in our earlier works we developed a theory of ballistic propagation of thermal excitations near a single , rectilinear vortex filament in @xmath0he - b @xcite , and studied interactions of thermal quasiparticles with simple , two - dimensional vortex configurations , such as clusters of vortex points @xcite and a gas of point vortices and/or vortex - antivortex pairs @xcite . in the latter two works we found and investigated the phenomenon of the so - called ` partial screening ' when the andreev shadow of a system of vortices is no longer equal to the sum of shadows of individual vortices",
    "however , the results following from our two - dimensional models should be regarded as qualitative rather than quantitative ; a quantitative comparison with experimental observations and andreev scattering data requires a fully three - dimensional study of vortex systems and quasiparticles trajectories .",
    "this work is concerned with the andreev scattering of thermal excitations by individual vortex rings in three - dimensional geometry .",
    "our study is particularly motivated by experimental observations of the transition from a gas of vortex rings to a dense vortex tangle @xcite , and measurements of the decay of quantum turbulence generated by a vibrating grid shedding quantized vortex rings in alternating directions @xcite .",
    "most conveniently the andreev scattering of thermal excitation by quantized vortex rings can be characterized by the cross - section defined either by the ratio of the total number of quasiparticles reflected by the ring per unit time to the number flux density of quasiparticles incident on the ring , or , alternatively , by the cross - section defined as the ratio of the total power reflected by the ring to the flux density of energy carried by incident quasiparticles . in this work",
    "both cross - sections are calculated as functions of the ring s size and orientation with respect to the direction of the incoming beam of thermal excitations .",
    "also calculated are the cross - sections averaged over all possible orientations of the ring .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quasiparticles ] , we shall introduce the equations of motion for ballistic quasiparticles in the superflow field , formulate the equations governing the fluid flow and the motion of quantized vortex rings , and define the cross - sections of interactions between thermal quasiparticles and vortex rings . in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] we describe the numerical method . in sec .",
    "[ sec : crosssections ] we shall calculate the scattering cross sections of the vortex rings and their systems . in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] we shall draw the conclusions .",
    "we will be concerned with the propagation of thermal excitations in @xmath0he - b at temperatures @xmath4 , where @xmath10 is the critical temperature .",
    "below all numerical data are taken at 0 bar pressure .    neglecting spatial variations of the order parameter , the energy of a thermal excitation of momentum @xmath11 in the flow field @xmath12 generated by the quantized vortex ring is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the `` kinetic '' energy of a thermal excitation relative to the fermi energy @xmath15 , @xmath16",
    ", @xmath17 is the effective mass of excitation in @xmath0he - b ( with @xmath18 being the bare mass of the @xmath0he atom ) .",
    "we will be considering the propagation of thermal excitations at distances from the vortex core exceeding the zero - temperature coherence length , @xmath19 so that the superfluid energy gap can be regarded as constant , @xmath20 ( here @xmath21 is the boltzmann s constant ) .",
    "excitations with @xmath22 and @xmath23 are called , respectively , quasiparticles and quasiholes .    below we will follow the approach developed in our earlier works  @xcite and assume that the interaction term , @xmath24 , varies on a spatial scale which is larger than @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the fermi velocity . then , following refs .",

    "note that the right - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rmotion ] ) represents the group velocity of thermal quasiparticle .    in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : rmotion])-([eq : pmotion ] ) , @xmath8 represents the flow field generated by the quantized vortex ring . in the zero - temperature limit ,",
    "the ring of radius @xmath31 moves in the direction orthogonal to the ring s plane with the self - induced velocity ( here we assume that the vortex core is hollow ) @xmath32\\ , , \\label{eq : vi}\\ ] ] where @xmath33 is the quantum of circulation in @xmath0he - b , and @xmath34 is the core radius . since @xmath34 , being of the order of coherence length , @xmath35 , is much smaller than the radius of the ring , it is appropriate to describe vortex lines as space curves of infinitesimal thickness",
    ".    the details of the fluid velocity field , @xmath12 generated by the vortex ring self - propagating in the inviscid fluid can be readily found for example in monograph by lamb  @xcite .",
    "however , for the purpose of this study it will be more convenient , using periodic boundary conditions , to calculate the flow field numerically from the biot - savart law @xmath36 where the integration extends over the whole vortex configuration .",
    "the motion and evolution of a single vortex ring or a system of quantized vortices is governed by the equation @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a position of a point on the vortex line .",
    "we consider the andreev scattering of the net flux of excitations which results in the case where there is a ( small ) temperature gradient . assuming that the source of thermal excitations is sufficiently far from quantized vortices , the beam of quasiparticles incident on the vortex ring ( or the vortex tangle ) can be regarded as one - dimensional .",
    "the differential fluxes of incident excitations , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , and energy , @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) ( that is , respectively , the number of quasiparticles passing and the total energy carried by these quasiparticles through unit area ) are @xcite @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is a temperature difference between the source of excitations and the opposite side of the experimental cell , @xmath46 @xmath47 being the density of states at the fermi energy with the corresponding fermi momentum , @xmath48 is the group velocity of bogoliubov quasiparticle , and @xmath49 is the fermi distribution . at considered ultra - low temperatures , @xmath50 , typical of turbulence experiments in @xmath0he - b , the fermi distribution reduces to the boltzmann distribution @xmath51    the quasiparticle trajectories resulting from interactions with the flow field of the vortex ring are determined from the solution of the problem represented by the closed system of equations ( [ eq : rmotion ] ) , ( [ eq : pmotion ] ) , ( [ eq : biot_savart ] ) , and ( [ eq : st ] ) ( the details of the numerical method will be discussed below in sec .",
    "[ sec : numerical ] ) .",
    "the initial conditions follow from the boltzmann distribution ( [ eq : boltzmann ] ) and the assumption that the initial positions of incident quasiparticles are distributed randomly on the plane orthogonal to the beam of excitations .",
    "the solution of this problem yields the total number of quasiparticles andreev - reflected by the vortex configuration per unit time , @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , and the total power dissipated by andreev - reflected quasiparticles , @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "then , the cross - section of andreev scattering by the vortex configuration ( ring ) can be defined as either @xmath56 or @xmath57 which we will call the particle and the thermal cross - section , respectively .",
    "note that these cross - sections correspond to the area of andreev shadow .",
    "numerical calculations reported below in sec .  [ sec : crosssections ] show that @xmath58 and @xmath59 are practically indistinguishable in all considered situations , thus confirming that definitions ( [ eq : sigman ] ) and ( [ eq : sigmae ] ) are correct .    for the quantized vortex ring ,",
    "the cross - section , @xmath60 ( below in this section the subscript , @xmath61 or @xmath62 is omitted ) is a function of the ring s size , @xmath31 , the ring s velocity , which is itself a function of @xmath31 , and the angle @xmath63 between the beam of incident quasiparticles and the direction of translational motion of the ring , i.e. @xmath64 . different orientations of the ring with respect to the beam of excitations , and andreev shadows in the cases where the ring moves either parallel or antiparallel to the direction of monochromatic beam of quasiparticles are illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : ringshadows ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     results shown in fig .  [ fig : screen ] ( left ) indicate that , despite the total vortex line length remains the same for all values of @xmath31 , the total scattering cross - section of the system decreases substantially with radius .",
    "figure  [ fig : screen ] ( right ) shows the dramatic increase of the screening from @xmath65 up to @xmath66 with decreasing the rings radii from @xmath67 to @xmath68 .",
    "this may be explained with the help of results illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : enersigmas ] which indicate that the main contribution to the cross - sections of smaller rings is made by the low energy quasiparticles . for the high energy quasiparticles",
    "sufficiently small rings are almost transparent .",
    "when the number of rings is increased so that the rings sizes are reduced , most of the low energy quasiparticles are reflected by the front - line rings , and just a small fraction of excitations reaches the rings in the bulk of the system ; hence , because most of the high energy quasiparticles are not andreev reflected at all , the screening effect increases .",
    "in conclusion , we have analyzed , for the first time , the three - dimensional andreev reflection of thermal quasiparticle excitations by quantized vortex rings in @xmath0he - b .",
    "the particle and thermal cross - sections ( i.e. the andreev reflection areas ) of quantized vortex rings are defined and calculated ; the results show a strong dependence of the cross - section on the angle between the incident beam of quasiparticles and the direction of motion of the vortex ring .",
    "it is also shown that the particle and the thermal cross - sections practically coincide .",
    "of a primary interest for interpretation of experimental data is the cross - section averaged over all possible orientations of the vortex ring .",
    "this is calculated and its dependence on the size of vortex ring is analyzed in detail .",
    "it is apparent that the phenomenon of partial screening investigated in the authors earlier works in two dimensions , plays a major rle for rings of sufficiently small size in three dimensions .",
    "the results are generalized for the case of andreev reflection by the system of vortex rings .",
    "it is found that due to the screening effects the total cross - section of the system of vortex rings is significantly smaller than the sum of cross - sections of individual vortices .",
    "furthermore , were two system of vortex rings have the same total line length , the andreev scattering cross - section is significantly larger of a system consisting of bigger rings .",
    "we introduced a screening factor of a system of vortex rings and showed that it decreases strongly with the average ring s radius .",
    "our results may be helpful for inferring quantitative properties of ballistic vortex rings produced by a vibrating grid at its low velocities , as in the experiment reported by bradley _",
    "our results can also be used for detecting the transition , observed in the cited experiment , from a gas of vortex rings to the dense vortex tangle ( based on the two - dimensional model of vortex points , a qualitative analysis of change of the andreev reflection coefficient during such a transition was given in our earlier paper  @xcite ; our new results may allow a more quantitative analysis ) .",
    "our choice of the range for vortex ring s sizes has been motivated by experiments  @xcite where the average size of rings produced by the vibrating grid was about @xmath69 . besides , the considered range of sizes was also chosen to capture a change of behavior , due to screening effects , of the angle - averaged cross - section occuring in the case where the ring becomes sufficiently small , see fig .  [",
    "fig : aversigmas ] . for rings larger than the largest considered in this work ,",
