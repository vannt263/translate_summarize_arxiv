    "in the description of the very beginning of the universe , well before the big bang nucleosynthesis , field theoretical models are to be considered instead of the usual hydrodynamical description of matter .",
    "those kinds of models , inspired by high - energy physics , have lead to numerous progress in modern cosmology , trying to solve various problems from cosmic acceleration or the flatness problem to the magnitude of the cosmological constant or the existence of topological defects .",
    "the motivation of this paper lies in two questions , amongst many others , that raise from the description of the very first moments by high energy physics .",
    "+   + first is the question whether large scale massless gauge fields can play any interesting role in cosmology .",
    "indeed , such fields could have existed in the early universe before the phase transitions of spontaneous symmetry breaking but , if they were ruled by usual yang - mills ( ym ) conformally invariant dynamics , their primeval excitations have probably been swept away by inflation .",
    "this point motivated some authors to study the impact of the born - infeld ( bi ) type modification of gauge dynamics , suggested by string theory , on cosmology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the bi lagrangian breaks down the scale invariance of the gauge fields beyond some critical energy , and therefore it is not obvious to conclude directly on the becoming of such gauge fields during and after an inflation period .",
    "furthermore , it was proved in @xcite that such gauge fields of bi - type can not provide any cosmic acceleration on their own although they can mimic a fluid of negative pressure . before going further on this question , it is therefore of first importance to study more deeply in a cosmological context the interaction between gauge and scalar fields as suggested in models inspired by high - energy physics .",
    "+ the second question is to see what happens to a possible scalar sector of gravitation during the cosmological evolution .",
    "indeed , string theories predict the existence of the dilaton @xcite , a lorentz scalar partner to the tensor einstein graviton as low - energy limit of bosonic actions .",
    "this large theoretical framework provides a physical background for tensor - scalar modification @xcite of general relativity , in which gravitation is mediated by long - range scalar field acting in complement of the usual spin 2 gravity fields .",
    "although this question has been widely studied when dilaton - or more generally tensor - scalar theories - is coupled to matter during radiation and matter dominated era , the case of a microscopic field model which would not be coupled universally to gravity , as suggested in string theory , has been less considered . in particular , how does the interaction between scalar and gauge fields modify their respective dynamics and the resulting cosmological evolution will be the main subject of the present paper .",
    "+   + but before going any further , let us locate the present work in the existing litterature .",
    "in this paper , we will focus on cosmological solutions of the einstein - born - infeld - dilaton ( ebid ) equations for flat spacetimes .",
    "cosmologies with large scale massless homogeneous and isotropic gauge fields with gauge group @xmath1 and ruled by usual ym dynamics have been studied for a long time ( @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational instability of flat spacetimes filled with such gauge fields was studied in @xcite .",
    "generalisation to higher gauge groups have also been studied @xcite in the case of flat and closed cosmologies .",
    "the einstein - born - infeld cosmology with non - abelian gauge fields deriving from gauge group @xmath1 has been studied thoroughly in @xcite for flat , closed and open spacetimes for any value of the cosmological constant .",
    "the minimal coupling of large scale cosmological gauge fields and scalar multiplets has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the einstein - yang - mills - dilaton ( eymd ) equations for flat cosmologies and a special case of non - universal coupling to gravity , have been derived in @xcite where the authors highlighted the energy exchange between the dilaton and the gauge fields and briefly discussed its effects on inflation , entropy crisis and the polonyi problem ( domination of a nearly massless dilaton at late times ) .",
    "however , they did not propose a complete solution to the eymd field equations in the cosmological framework which could allow to address completely these issues .",
    "moreover , they did not discuss the general influence of non - universal coupling to gravity as well .",
    "the eymd system was also studied in @xcite in the case of closed friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) with a static gauge field and vanishing dilaton potential and cosmological constant .",
    "+   + as we told before , tensor - scalar cosmologies have been widely studied , with a large spectrum of applications for physical cosmology : inflation , primordial nucleosynthesis , cosmic microwave background , ... the question of the convergence of tensor - scalar theories to general relativity during the cosmological evolution has been widely studied in @xcite and references therein . for the so - called `` _ _ einstein conformal frame _ _ '' , where the gravitational and scalar fields have pure spin 2 and spin 0 dynamics respectively , the scalar sector of gravitation disappears naturally during cosmic expansion due to its coupling to matter .",
    "the cosmological evolution of the dilaton emerging from string theory has been studied in @xcite .",
    "+   + in this paper , we will consider the cosmological evolution of the dilaton coupled directly to a large - scale non - abelian gauge field ruled by bi dynamics which go beyond the scale invariance of ym theory .",
    "a non - universal coupling to gravity , as suggested in preceding works , will lead to quite different results to the usual coupling of tensor - scalar theories to a fluid .",
    "for example , when the gauge fields are governed by ym scale - invariant dynamics , the scalar sector of gravitation remains directly coupled to the gauge fields although they mimic a radiation fluid .",
    "it is well - known that tensor - scalar theories decouple from radiation ( except during phase transition ) . through both numerical computations and analytical solutions",
    ", we will show how the dilaton evolution is modified by non - universal coupling to the metric .",
    "this will lead to remarkable consequences for cosmology .",
    "+   + the structure of this paper will be as follows . in section 2 , we establish the general field equations for the ebid cosmology . in section 3 ,",
    "we first remind the reader about bi cosmology as was studied in @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian bi cosmology can be split in two extreme regimes depending on the energy density of the gauge field compared with a critical scale introduced in the bi theory . for large energies",
    ", the gauge field is shown to mimic a fluid of negative pressure with @xmath2 while in the low - energy limit the scale - invariant ym dynamics is retrieved and the gauge field looks like a radiation fluid .",
    "on the other hand , we also remind the reader about dilaton cosmology , studied in @xcite .",
    "as the equations are to be established and solved with pure spin degrees of freedom in the einstein frame , the interpretation in terms of the jordan physical frame is also recalled .",
    "the case of universal coupling is solved there with usual properties of tensor - scalar theories . in section 4 , we will focus on the strong field limit of the ebid system with general coupling to gravity and in section 5 the low - energy limit which consists of a generalised version of the eymd system appearing in @xcite is treated . in section 6 ,",
    "we analyse a complete cosmological evolution of the ebid system and present evidences for possible cosmic acceleration in the physical jordan frame .",
    "this frame is defined with respect to a pressureless matter fluid that has been added to the gauge sector .",
    "the acceleration is shown to resist to the attraction provided by matter and appears to be intrinsically related to the non - universality of the coupling to gravity . finally , we conclude in section 7 by some perspectives to the present work .",
    "most of the interest of field models , for example deriving from string theory in the low energy - limit , comes from their non - universal coupling to the gravity fields @xmath3 and its scalar counterpart @xmath4 ( each type of matter field has in general its own coupling function to the dilaton , see @xcite ) .",
    "this results in a violation of the weak equivalence principle and therefore the gravitational interaction of these microscopic field models is different from an usual tensor - scalar theory where the weak equivalence principle is usually assumed . without imposing such a violation of the weak equivalence principle at a microscopic scale , field models",
    "would not be different than considering a tensor - scalar theory in presence of a fluid with the equation of state of the considered fields .",
    "therefore , we will make use of a general form of the action for the non - abelian einstein - born - infeld - dilaton system , that takes into account a possible violation of the weak equivalence principle .",
    "this action writes down @xmath5\\cdot\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this action , the gravitational interaction is described by the scalar curvature @xmath6 and the dilaton @xmath4 , @xmath7 being the `` _ _ bare _ _ '' gravitational coupling constant and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 being three different coupling functions of the dilaton to matter .",
    "the first two illustrate the coupling of the gauge sector to the volume form and to the einstein metric @xmath3 inside the born - infeld lagrangian @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 are the non - abelian gauge potentials ) and the last coupling function @xmath10 is related to another type of matter ruled by the action @xmath13 .",
    "another parametrisations of einstein - born - infeld - dilaton action were considered in the litterature , for example with @xmath14 and @xmath15 in @xcite and with @xmath16 in @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian gauge interaction is described by the born - infeld lagrangian build upon the field strength tensor @xmath17 ( with @xmath18 are the generators of the gauge group under consideration ) and its dual tensor @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , this lagrangian , denoted by @xmath11 in ( [ lebid ] ) , is defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the born - infeld critical energy and @xmath9 is the dilaton coupling function which is equal to @xmath22 when non - perturbative effects are not taken into account ( see @xcite ) . in this case , @xmath23 will be called the dilaton coupling constant . throughout this paper , we will assume the planck system of units , in which @xmath24 and @xmath25 , with the planck mass @xmath26 and the gravitational coupling constant is @xmath27 .",
    "we have also set the gauge coupling constant to unity , as it actually defines a system of units for the dilaton field @xmath4 , provided the dilaton being massless ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the born - infeld critical energy @xmath29 defines the scale above which non local effects of string theory arise and where the scale invariance of the gauge fields is broken .",
    "for example , in the low - energy limit @xmath30 of the born - infeld part of the action ( [ lebid ] ) , we recover the usual , conformally invariant , yang - mills ( ym ) lagrangian density for the non - abelian gauge field : @xmath31 in this paper , we will focus on cosmology and therefore we will adopt the prescriptions of the cosmological principle which states that the spatial sections of our universe are homogeneous and isotropic . for the sake of simplicity , we will also restrict ourselves to the case of flat space - times , which constitutes however a very nice approximation of the present universe and its early stages as well .",
    "the metric describing such spacetimes is the one of friedmann - lemaitre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the scale factor and @xmath34 is the so - called _ lapse function _ of the hamiltonian arnowitt - deser - misner approach to general relativity .",
    "this function can be fixed by a specific choice of time coordinate ( gravitational gauge freedom ) .",
    "the symmetries prescribed by the cosmological principle we assume impose that the dilaton scalar field @xmath4 depends only on time .",
    "+   + a remarkable fact about non - abelian gauge fields is that they admit non - trivial homogeneous and isotropic configurations at the opposite of their abelian @xmath35 counterparts ( see @xcite and references therein for a complete discussion of the @xmath1 case ) .",
    "the main reason for that is because only the gauge invariant quantities such as the field strength tensor have to exhibit the symmetries explicitly , while the gauge potentials can be symmetric up to a gauge transformation ( see @xcite for more general gauge groups ) . as a result",
    ", the energy can be distributed amongst the different gauge degrees of freedom while the stress - energy tensor remain compatible with the maximal symmetry of the space - time background . in this paper",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath36valued gauge potentials , for which the ansatz @xmath37 of the connexion one - form @xmath38 makes the gauge invariant quantities satisfying the required symmetry ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining dynamical degrees of freedom of the gauge potential are now expressed by the field @xmath39 . however",
    ", our results will not depend on this particular choice as the ansatz above can be generalised to higher gauge groups ( see @xcite ) . in the equation above",
    ", the generators @xmath40 of the lie algebra of the gauge group @xmath1 are to be taken in the coordinate dependent basis of the gauge degrees of freedom space as follows : @xmath41 with @xmath42 the usual basis of the lie algebra @xmath0 ( @xmath43 being the pauli matrices ) with the following standard normalization conditions and commutation relations : @xmath44=i\\epsilon_{\\bf{ab}}^{\\bf{c}}t_{\\bf{c}}\\ ] ] the ansatz ( [ flrwamu ] ) is of course independent of the particular choice of the action for the gauge field , as was shown in @xcite . +   + the symmetries implied by the cosmological principle therefore allow us to write down ( [ lebid ] ) as an effective one dimensional action , after integrating over @xmath45 and dividing by the infinite volume of its orbits : @xmath46 where a dot denotes a derivative with respect to the time @xmath47 and where @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 where @xmath39 is the gauge potential as defined in ( [ flrwamu ] ) . following @xcite , it is also convenient to write @xmath48 as @xmath50 with @xmath51 from the action ( [ ebid ] ) and relation ( [ bigr ] ) , it is straightforward to write down the field equations for the einstein - born - infeld - dilaton system by varying this action over the following degrees of freedom : @xmath52 and @xmath53",

    "the friedmann equation allows us to define the born - infeld effective energy density of the gauge field as a generalisation of what was proposed in @xcite @xmath63 the euler - lagrange equation for the scale factor @xmath64 gives the acceleration equation : @xmath65,\\ ] ] where @xmath66 stands for the pressure of the additional matter fluid .",
    "this allow us to define the born - infeld effective pressure @xmath67 and the equation of state @xmath68 for the gauge part of the ebid system as in @xcite . here",
    "we see that the @xmath36valued gauge fields ruled by born - infeld lagrangian can be represented by a fluid with an equation of state that varies continuously from @xmath69 , when the bi energy density is much larger that the critical field @xmath70 , to @xmath71 at low energies @xmath72 .",
    "these two extreme regimes correspond to a gas of nambu - goto strings in three spatial dimensions on one hand ( strong field limit ) and radiations on the other ( weak field limit ) .",
    "the transition between these regimes occurs at vanishing pressure when the bi energy density is of order of the bi critical energy scale @xmath29 . at low energies ( @xmath73 )",
    ", the gauge field behaves like radiation as expected because the bi lagrangian reduces to the conformally invariant yang - mills one .",
    "+   + it is also important to notice that there is no cosmic acceleration with the metric @xmath3 as long as the dilaton is massless .",
    "indeed , the highest value of @xmath74 that can be achieved in this frame is identically zero ( see [ acc ] ) , in the limit of the pure einstein - born - infeld system at high energies ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 ) .",
    "however , we will see that cosmic acceleration may appear once we examine the behaviour in another frame .",

    "the key point of the physics in the ebid system lies in the fact that the dilaton field couples differently to the gauge sector of the theory ( last term ) depending on the values of the coupling functions @xmath81 and @xmath82 . although the cosmological dynamics of the gauge fields ruled by born - infeld lagrangian can be regarded as a fluid with an equation of state given by ( [ eos ] )",
    ", the coupled dynamics of the dilaton and the gauge field does not reduce in general to a scalar - tensor theory with this fluid as background .",

    "in the general case , there exists a non - trivial energy exchange between the dilaton and the gauge sectors of the theory that will dominate at late epochs as we shall see further .",

    "it is important to notice that we did not assume any direct coupling between the gauge field and the additional matter fluid , which will allow to treat them separately .",
    "+   + indeed , from equation ( [ bi ] ) , and following @xcite , it is possible to derive an energy conservation equation for the bi density : @xmath86 now that we have derived the complete set of the ebid field equations for cosmology , we propose the reader to briefly review some basic features of born - infeld cosmology on one hand and dilaton cosmology on the other . in the rest of this paper , we will only consider a massless dilaton ( i.e. , vanishing self - interaction potential @xmath87 ) .",
    "the non - abelian born - infeld cosmology in various spacetimes with different values of the curvature and the cosmological constant was described in detail in @xcite .",

    "the equation ( [ cons ] ) for bi energy conservation can be written as @xmath91 which admits a first integral : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is a positive constant . in the strong field limit , @xmath94 , the bi energy density redshifts as @xmath95 while in the weak limit , @xmath96 , we retrieve the radiation behaviour @xmath97 characteristic of the conformal invariance of the gauge field at such energies .",
    "this allows to treat separately the spacetime evolution and the dynamics of the gauge field .",

    "finally , let us focus on the gauge sector of the ebid system . in the strong field limit ,",

    "more precisely , the dilaton tends to @xmath149 . as a conclusion , although the gauge field looks like radiation at a large - scale level , the non - universal microscopic coupling between dilaton and gauge sectors finally dominates at large redshift and freezes the energy contribution of both sectors in such a way that none of these components completely dominates .     as a function of the p - time variable in the weak field limit (",
    "@xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , @xmath165 ) ]     as a function of the p - time variable in the weak field limit ( same parameters as above ) ]    figure [ sigmad_ym ] presents the evolution of the gauge field velocity @xmath105 with the scale factor .",
    "the gauge field appear to be damped by its coupling to the dilaton and in fact the whole gauge sector looses energy at a rate fixed by ( [ cons ] ) .",
    "figure [ a_ym ] shows the departure of the scale factor from the radiation solution : @xmath166 for the numerical solution presented in this section .",
    "we see that the departure is important when the scalar field is dominating at early times ( @xmath167 ) then finally converges to a slightly less strong expansion at late times ( @xmath168 ) , when the equilibrium has been reached .        before going further ,",
    "let us summarise the cosmological evolution of the fields constituting the ebid system in the ym regime .",
    "first , the dilaton is damped until its velocity is attracted to a negative ( resp .",
    "positive ) value for the particular coupling @xmath14 and @xmath133 and @xmath124 ( resp . @xmath157 and @xmath158 ) .",
    "however , it should have been damped to rest if it would have been plunged in a radiation - dominated universe with universal coupling .",
    "because its velocity has been attracted to a negative value , the dilaton field will eventually diverge linearly to @xmath149 ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "this is exactly the opposite situation of the strong field limit that was presented before where the coupling term drives the dilaton to infinitely high values . in a general situation where the gauge field starts with an energy much higher than the bi critical energy and",
    "then cools down to ym dynamics , one should expect that the dilaton reaches some extremum value ( @xmath169 ) during the transition .",
    "this will be treated in the next section .",
    "let us follow in detail some typical cosmological evolutions of the ebid system for various couplings .",
    "starting at singularity , the dilaton is in general relativistic ( @xmath170 and @xmath171 ) .",
    "the expansion therefore begins at @xmath172 with an infinite rate and the gauge field dynamics is dominated by the non - local effects induced by the bi non - linearity ( @xmath125 ) . as energy is exchanged between the dilaton and the gauge field in the strong - field regime , the dilaton velocity is attracted to some value depending on the coupling functions , as illustrated in figure [ phip_trans ] . during this phase ,",
    "the velocity of the dilaton in p - time is indeed a positive ( negative ) constant when @xmath14 and @xmath133 ( @xmath157 and @xmath158 or the universal coupling @xmath83 ) .",
    "when the gauge energy density has decreased to the bi critical energy ( @xmath173 ) , the dilaton velocity leaves the strong - field attractor to enter the ym low - energy regime .",
    "the epoch of this transition varies according to the coupling functions considered ( see figure [ phip_trans ] ) .",
    "it then moves to the low - energy attractor by accomplishing damped oscillations around the analytical solutions proposed in the previous section ( with @xmath159 ) or is damped to vanishing velocities when there is universal coupling ( see section 3 ) . with non - universal coupling ( @xmath159 ) , the value of the dilaton field reaches some extremum ( @xmath169 ) on its way to the second attractor .",
    "this extremum is unavoidable as we have seen that the attractors of the dilaton velocity in the strong and weak field regimes are of opposite signs and its velocity will therefore vanish at some time during the transition between these two attracting regimes .     and @xmath174 ( solid line ) ; @xmath175 and @xmath176 ( dashed - dot ) and universal coupling ( @xmath83 , dotted line ) ( @xmath160 , @xmath177 , @xmath162 , @xmath178 , @xmath164 , @xmath179 ) ]     with @xmath180 for the curves in figure [ phip_trans ] ( same parameters as above ) ]    it is also interesting to examine the evolution of the gauge field energy density .",
    "figure [ rho_tilde ] represents the gauge field energy density @xmath181 related to the curves in figure [ phip_trans ] . with universal coupling @xmath83",
    ", we retrieve a cosmological evolution given by equation ( [ consbis ] ) and its first integral ( [ fi ] ) : @xmath95 in the strong field regime and @xmath97 at low energies .",
    "the assumption of non - universal coupling now leads to different evolutions of the gauge field energy density , which in fact are given by the more general energy conservation equation ( [ cons ] ) .",
    "the differences between the evolutions comes from the particular trajectories illustrated in figure [ phip_trans ] .",
    "+   + now that we have reviewed the main features of a general full cosmological evolution from high to low energy regimes , it is also important to discuss the evolution of the observed cosmological parameters like the scale factor , the hubble expansion rate or the accelerating parameter in the jordan physical frame . in order to define such a frame",
    ", we will introduce an additional matter pressureless fluid which will verify the weak equivalence principle .",
    "the energy density @xmath182 of this fluid in the einstein frame is related to the physical energy density @xmath183 through the relation ( [ jordan2 ] ) .",
    "the coupling function @xmath10 to ordinary matter defines now our `` _ _ observable _ _ '' jordan frame by @xmath184 in the jordan frame obtained by the previous conformal transformation , the energy density @xmath183 of the matter fluid is ruled by the same conservation laws as in general relativity .",
    "this is true because there is no direct interaction between the gauge sector and the additional matter fluid and therefore they decouple from each other .",
    "the field equation for the gauge potential @xmath53 does not need to be modified as we do not assume any direct coupling with the pressureless fluid .",
    "we will now consider the field equations for the ebid system we have written in section 2 for the einstein metric @xmath3 with a pressureless fluid @xmath185 .",
    "+   + the observable scale factor in the jordan frame will be given by @xmath186 while the synchronous time in the jordan frame is denoted by @xmath187 then , the hubble expansion rate can be derived directly @xmath188 where @xmath189 is the hubble parameter in the einstein frame , a prime denoting a derivative with respect to @xmath190 ( einstein frame ) and @xmath191 .",
    "the acceleration parameter @xmath192 in the jordan frame can be written @xmath193 where a dot over a quantity expressed in the jordan frame means a derivative with respect to the synchronous time @xmath194 in that frame .",
    "although there is no possibility of a cosmic acceleration ( @xmath195 ) in the einstein frame ( unless one considers a non - vanishing potential , see relation ( [ acc ] ) ) , this does not rule out a possible acceleration for the observable scale factor given by ( [ a_jordan ] ) . indeed ,",
    "the existence of fluid ( constituted by our born - infeld non - abelian gauge field ) that violates the weak equivalence principle will result in a possibility of cosmic acceleration . to show that this is actually the case even in presence of matter fluid which would make the tensor - scalar theory converging to general relativity",
    "if taken alone , we will use the coupling function @xmath196 .",
    "figure [ qtilde ] illustrates evolutions of the acceleration parameter in the jordan frame @xmath197 , given by ( [ q_jordan ] ) as a function of the jordan scale factor @xmath198 .",
    "the solutions presented here are expanding universes ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "four different couplings have been considered , including the simple case of @xmath200 which corresponds to different couplings of gravitation to the gauge and the matter sector .",
    "the pressureless fluid energy density at start has been chosen to dominate the bi energy density by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "as the gauge field starts in the strong field regime , its energy density will scale approximately with @xmath201 , depending on the coupling functions ( see also figure [ rho_tilde ] ) .",
    "therefore , the gauge sector rapidly dominates the energy content of the universe .",
    "the dynamics of the dilaton is as described earlier : after having moved to the strong field regime attractor , the transition to ym dynamics occurs and the dilaton quickly moves to the low - energy attractor . during this transition",
    ", acceleration appears in the jordan frame defined by the pressureless fluid as indicated in figure [ qtilde ] .",
    "we see also that any violation of the weak equivalence principle ( here by taking @xmath202 , @xmath203 or @xmath204 ) lead to cosmic acceleration even with tensor - scalar theory that would alone converge to general relativity .",
    "an important condition for cosmic acceleration is to have a repulsive force term in the dilaton equation .",
    "therefore , the ebid system with a non - universal coupling to gravitation offers the interesting possibility to build a scenario for dark energy or inflation . for the curves represented here , the acceleration periods are shorter than in a usual lcdm or quintessence model[multiblock footnote omitted ] . and",
    "therefore a more complete study should be done to determine if it is possible to explain distance - redshifts measurements with ebid fields .     and @xmath174 ( solid line ) ; @xmath175 and @xmath176 ( dashed - dot )",
    "; universal coupling ( @xmath205 , dotted line ) and @xmath206 , @xmath207 ( dashed - dashed , @xmath208 ) ( @xmath160 , @xmath209 , @xmath162 , @xmath210 , @xmath179 , @xmath211 , @xmath212 ) ]    it should also be noticed that an ebid dark energy scenario would predict a finite period of acceleration . indeed ,",
    "as the gauge field will recover a ym dynamics at the end of its evolution , its energy density will finally scales as @xmath213 and will finally be dominated by a pressureless fluid . therefore , the questions whether cosmic acceleration ( @xmath214 ) can occur , with which intensity and for how long seems to depend on both initial energy distribution , the value of the dilaton coupling constant and the critical bi energy scale @xmath21 .",
    "more work should focus on that point to see if it would be possible to build a physically relevant quintessence model with the ebid field equations .",
    "however , the perspectives of cosmic acceleration in the jordan frame do exist and this looks particularly interesting for our view of modern cosmology .",
    "the non - abelian einstein - born - infeld - dilaton model provides an interesting framework , motivated by string theory , to study the impact of large scale non abelian gauge fields on tensor - scalar theories of the gravitational interaction . in this paper",
    ", we focused on the cosmological evolution of an homogeneous and isotropic configuration of these fields in a flat background .",
    "the microscopic coupling between the dilaton and gauge fields induced by non - universal coupling to the metric leads to an energy exchange between both gravitational and gauge sectors that will alter the usual dynamics of tensor - scalar theories ( for which the coupling is universal ) .",
    "+   + as in non - abelian born - infeld cosmology , we considered two different regimes depending on the gauge energy density compared to the critical energy that parametrizes the born - infeld lagrangian .",
    "we have derived both analytical and numerical solutions to describe the cosmological evolution of the whole system . in the case of non - universal coupling ,",
    "the gravitational scalar field no more depends on the equation of state of the gauge field and the dynamics is altered as follows .",
    "+   + in the particular case of a brans - dicke theory , in which non - perturbative terms for the dilaton are not considered , we have shown that the energy exchange resulting from the particular couplings damps the dilaton to a frozen non - vanishing velocity . in the high energy regime of the gauge dynamics ,",
    "the attracting value for the velocity is positive when the gauge field couples more to the metric than to the volume form .",
    "the opposite situation happens in the low - energy regime where the gauge field is ruled by yang - mills lagrangian .",
    "therefore , in a general cosmological evolution where the gauge field cools down to low - energies , there is a transition between the two attractors .",
    "their values are directly proportional to the value of the dilatonic coupling constant . +   + however , it is well - known from experimental tests of the gravitational theory , especially the determination of the post - newtonian parameter @xmath215 , that the value of the coupling @xmath216 is at least of order @xmath217 , roughly @xmath218 for @xmath219 ( see @xcite for a recent estimation of the post - newtonian parameter @xmath220 ) .",
    "the influence of the dilaton potential is also important to consider .",
    "furthermore , the constraints on the weak equivalence principle obtained by the tests on the universality of free fall exclude a violation of this principle that would exceed a part in @xmath117 .",
    "one can therefore argue that the effect of such non - universal couplings should be neglected .",
    "but , if the violation of the weak equivalence principle only applies to large - scale fields which do not couple to ordinary matter and whose distribution is roughly homogeneous , their energy density on our scales is far beyond experimental reach and the violation could be hard to exhibit .",
    "+   + the interesting possibility introduced by such a violation is a cosmic acceleration in the physical frame associated to ordinary matter . in this work ,",
    "we build a first simple model based on our treatment of the ebid field equations that exhibits periods of accelerations in presence of ordinary matter verifying the weak equivalence principle .",
    "the acceleration has been shown to resist to the attracting property of the accompanying matter and seems to be a general feature of a non - universal coupling to gravitation .",
    "furthermore , this model respects the weak energy condition @xmath221 in the frame of the physical degrees of freedom ( the einstein frame ) .",
    "the born - infeld dynamics of the gauge field plays a crucial role in this kind of dark energy model by ensuring a late arising of this mechanism ( when the gauge field mimics a nambu - goto string gas ) and even predicts an end to the dark energy domination ( when the gauge field looks like radiation ) . an interesting perspective to",
    "this work would be to use this remarkable feature of non - abelian born - infeld gauge fields to build physical models for quintessence and , maybe , inflation .",
    "+   + in conclusion , we can say that our study of non - abelian born - infeld gauge fields coupled to to tensor - scalar gravity opens new and interesting perspectives for the question of the attraction to general relativity as well as other crucial topics of modern cosmology such as inflation or dark energy .",
    "the authors warmly thank j. larena for the many interesting discussions we had about the underlying physics of this paper .",
    "here we give some details of the numerical integration of the full ebid system we use to illustrate this paper . in order to integrate the system of equations ( [ acc ] ) , ( [ hebid ] ) , ( [ kg ] ) and ( [ bi ] ) , we choose the following procedure .",
    "first , we rewrite equations ( [ acc ] ) , ( [ kg ] ) and ( [ bi ] ) as a system of six first - order ode s and keep the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hebid ] ) to check the consistency of the numerical computation . then , let us redefine the fields in such a way that they will be approximately of the same order of magnitude ( this will avoid stiffness problems in the integration ) : @xmath222 where @xmath223 and @xmath224 will be the fields to integrate .",
    "it is also useful to set @xmath225 and @xmath226 .",
    "once the equations have been rewritten under these considerations , we choose the initial conditions as follows : @xmath227 is set to @xmath228 and @xmath229 to zero ( we therefore start with a `` @xmath230 '' gauge coupling constant equal to unity in the einstein frame ) .",
    "we choose the ratio @xmath231 so that we can control the type of gauge dynamics ( bi , ym or transition ) we start with .",
    "then , we choose the value of @xmath232 so that the initial expansion rate will be given by @xmath233 .",
    "this gives also @xmath234 as it is equal to @xmath235 .",
    "then , without loss of generality , we can assume @xmath236 and determine @xmath237 from the postulated value of @xmath238 .",
    "numerical integration of the system of six ode s is performed using the standard method of shampine - gordon @xcite . to monitor the accuracy of the numerical solution",
    ", we compute the absolute violation of the hamiltonian constraint ( [ hebid ] ) : @xmath239 all along the integration .",
    "the numerical integration makes the violation of the hamiltonian constraint diverging exponentially with time and we indicated in the previous figures the final absolute error reached for each of the numerical solution that were presented .",
