    "large - scale radio halos in clusters of galaxies are diffuse radio sources with no apparent parent galaxy , typical sizes of 1 mpc , low surface brightness and steep radio spectrum .",
    "they demonstrate the existence of relativistic electrons and large scale magnetic fields in the intracluster medium .",
    "the sources classified as _ radio halos _ are located at the cluster centers .",
    "sources with similar properties have also been found at the cluster peripheries : they are called _ relic _ sources . moreover , in some clusters with a central dominant galaxy , the relativistic particles can be traced out quite far , forming what is called a _ mini - halo _ ( see e.g. 3c  84 in the perseus cluster , burns 1992 ) .",
    "the radio halos and relics are a rare phenomenon .",
    "they are present in a few rich clusters , characterized by high x - ray luminosity and high temperature .",
    "the prototypical example of cluster - wide radio halo is coma - c , in coma ( see giovannini 1993 and references therein ) .",
    "the coma cluster also contains the peripheral relic 1253 + 275 , which is connected to coma - c through a very low - brightness bridge of radio emission ( see e.g. feretti & giovannini 1998 ) .",
    "other radio halos studied in detail so far are those in a  2255 ( burns 1995 , feretti 1997a ) , and in a  2319 ( feretti 1997b ) . well studied relic sources are those in a  2256 ( rttgering 1994 ) , a  3667 ( rttgering 1997 ) , and a  85 ( bagchi 1998 ) .",
    "the properties of halos and relics are not yet well understood , because of the low number of known sources of this type . also , it is not yet clear if radio halos and relics have a common origin and evolution , or should be considered as different classes of sources .",
    "information on a larger sample of halos and relics is crucial to investigate their formation and evolution , and their relation to other cluster properties . to this aim",
    "we undertook the search for new candidates of radio halos and relics in the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss , condon 1998 ) . in this paper",
    "we report the detection of new halo and relic candidates , which significantly increase the number of diffuse sources in clusters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 we describe the sample of clusters which were inspected in the nvss , in sect .",
    "3 we present the results , in sect .",
    "4 we give comments on the individual sources and their clusters , in sect .",
    "5 we discuss the results .    a hubble constant h@xmath0=50 km s@xmath1 mpc@xmath1 and a deceleration parameter q@xmath0=1 are assumed throughout .",
    "we searched for cluster - wide radio sources in clusters using the public images of the nvss .",
    "this radio survey was performed at 1.4 ghz with the very large array ( vla ) in the tightest configuration ( d ) .",
    "it has an angular resolution of 45   ( hpbw ) , a noise level of 0.45 mjy ( 1@xmath2 ) and covers all the sky north of declination = 40 .    as a cluster sample we used the sample of x - ray - brightest abell - type clusters ( xbacs ) presented by ebeling ( 1996 ) , consisting of 283 clusters / subclusters from the catalogue of abell , corwin & olowin ( 1989 , aco ) detected in the rosat all sky survey ( rass ) with x - ray flux f@xmath3 5 10@xmath4 erg @xmath5 s@xmath1 in the 0.1 - 2.4 kev energy range .",
    "this is an all - sky , x - ray flux limited sample , complete in the galactic latitude range @xmath620   and in the redshift interval z@xmath70.2 , but it contains also 12 clusters at lower galactic latitude and 24 clusters with redshift greater than 0.2 that meet the flux criterion ( see tables 3 and 4 in ebeling 1996 ) .    because of the lack of short baselines , the nvss is insensitive to extended structure larger than 15 .",
    "since the known radio halos are about 1 mpc in size , sources of this type are missed in the nvss if belonging to nearby clusters .",
    "we note indeed that the radio halo in coma ( z = 0.0232 ) is resolved out in the nvss , because of the lack of short spacings .",
    "we have taken as a limiting redshift for the search of diffuse cluster - wide halos and relics the value z=0.044 , which corresponds to a largest detectable linear size of about 1 mpc . considering this redshift limit , and taking also into account the declination limit of the nvss",
    ", we ended with a sample of 207 clusters .",
    "for each of them , we searched for the nvss image , and extracted a field of 1@xmath81 , centered on the cluster position given in the xbacs catalogue .",
    "we remark here that this is the x - ray position and may be different from that of the optical cluster center .",
    "moreover , in the case that the x - ray structure is double or more complex , the xbacs position refers to the centroid of the x - ray emission .",
    "the two clusters a  1773 and a  3888 fall in the few remaining gaps of the nvss , and therefore no image is currently available for them . for a few other clusters , the field retrieved from the nvss is slightly smaller than 1 square degree , because of the existence of gaps at one of the field edges ; however , the available image covers a significant region of the clusters . in conclusion",
    ", we have finally inspected 205 clusters , for a total of about 0.062 steradians .",
    "the redshift distribution of the searched clusters with respect to the distribution of the whole xbacs catalogue is shown in fig . 1 .    to search for the cluster diffuse sources",
    ", we used the nvss images overlaid upon the optical images from the digitized palomar sky survey ( pss ) .",
    "we considered as diffuse cluster sources the radio features with surface brightness greater than the 3 @xmath2 level , which were found to be : i ) resolved , ii ) not associated with bright galaxies , iii ) not clearly related to extended radio galaxies , iv ) not simply attributable to the blend of pointlike sources .",
    "thanks to the large images retrieved from the nvss , we are confident that we could easily recognize and avoid the side lobes of near strong sources possibly present because of dynamical range problems .",
    "we looked into the literature and in the vla faint images of the radio sky at twenty - centimeters ( first ) survey ( becker 1995 ) to discriminate the diffuse sources from discrete unrelated radio sources . in some cases , where no high resolution data are available and the radio structure is ambiguous",
    ", we considered the halo and relic candidates as uncertain .",
    "we included in our sample also a few cases where the evidence of an extended radio emission is marginal but the presence of a diffuse emission was already known from the literature ( see notes to the individual clusters ) .",
    "with the above criteria , we have found diffuse extended emission in 29 clusters , listed in table 1 . in 9 clusters ,",
    "the presence of a diffuse extended radio source is uncertain , because of the possible contamination of discrete radio galaxies or because the diffuse radio emission is very faint .",
    "these clusters are indicated by `` u '' in column 7 of table 1 .",
    "the redshift distribution of clusters with diffuse sources with respect to that of the inspected clusters is presented in fig .",
    "we remind that we could have missed extended sources because of their low surface brightness .",
    "we also are aware that we can miss very extended sources ( @xmath9 1 mpc ) in the clusters at lowest redshifts because of the poor sampling of short baselines .",
    "this implies that the sample of diffuse sources found in this search might be slightly biased toward sources at high redshift . on the other hand",
    ", we note that in distant clusters diffuse extended sources could be , in some cases , considered as discrete sources because of the large beam .    according to the literature",
    ", we classify the detected extended source as halos , if they are centrally located in the cluster , or relics if they are peripheral . in the case that peripheral relics are projected onto the cluster center ,",
    "they would be classified as halo sources .",
    "more detailed observations will be necessary for a correct classification .",
    "the list presented in table 1 contains most of the well known radio halos and relics , but also includes 18 clusters where this is the first indication of the existence of a diffuse source ( see last column in table 1 ) . among the latter ,",
    "11 are considered good candidates , while 7 are uncertain .",
    "the images of all the diffuse radio sources , overlaid onto the red images of the pss , are given in fig .",
    "we present in table 2 the parameters of the halo and relic candidates , excluding the uncertain diffuse sources , for which the measurement of flux density and extension is very difficult because strong contaminating sources are often present .",
    "the radio flux density refers to the extended emission after subtraction of obvious discrete sources .",
    "the size is the largest dimension of the diffuse radio emission .",
    "we are aware that flux densities and sizes can be quite underestimated , because of the low sensitivity to extended structures .",
    "nevertheless , more than half of the sources given in table 2 have a size larger than 1 mpc .",
    "for the relics , we also give the projected distance between the approximate centroid of the radio emitting region and the x - ray cluster center .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     caption .",
    "col 1 : x - ray luminosity range ; col 2 : number of searched clusters ; col 3 : number of clusters with diffuse halos or relics ; col 4 : number of clusters with uncertain diffuse sources .",
    "we have looked for a possible correlation between the radio power of diffuse sources and the cluster x - ray luminosity .",
    "the plot of these parameters is given in fig .",
    "although the data show a large scatter , the lack of high power radio sources in clusters of low x - ray luminosity is clear , while highly luminous x - ray clusters may have extended sources of either high or low radio power .",
    "since the radio powers computed here may be largely underestimated because of missing flux , due to the steep spectrum of halos and relics and the poor sampling of short spacings , further investigation of this correlation is needed .",
    "a complete analysis of the connection between cluster properties and presence of diffuse sources is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we only note that the clusters a  2744 , a  520 , a  545 , a  773 , and a  2254 , which are found here for the first time to host a central radio halo , are all non - cooling flow clusters ( white 1997 , allen & fabian 1998 ) . likewise , all the abell clusters listed by allen & fabian ( 1998 ) as non - cooling flow clusters are found to host a radio halo , with the exception of a  2219 , where the presence of a halo in considered uncertain but is possible .",
    "these results reinforce the strong correlation between the absence of a cooling flow and the presence of a radio halo at the cluster center .",
    "we have presented in this paper new halo and relic candidates , found in the nvss after inspection of a sample of clusters from the xbacs catalogue .",
    "we found 29 candidates , which can be divided as follows :    @xmath10 11 clusters were already known from the literature .",
    "out of them , 7 contain radio halos ( a  401 , a  665 , a  1300 , a  2163 , a  2218 , a  2255 , a  2319 ) , 2 contain relics ( a  85 , a  2256 ) , while the remaining 2 ( a  754 , a  2142 ) can not be confirmed on the basis of the nvss images , and are therefore still considered uncertain .",
    "we note that in the clusters a  1300 and a  2255 , also the existence of a peripheral relic is reported in the literature .",
    "@xmath10 in 18 clusters , this is the first indication of the existence of a diffuse extended source . among them",
    ", we found 6 clusters with halos ( a  2744 , a  520 , a  545 , a  773 , a  1914 , a  2254 ) , and 5 clusters with relics ( a  13 , a  115 , a  548b , a1664 , a  2345 ) . the cluster a  2345 contains actually 2 relics .",
    "the 7 clusters a  22 , a  133 , a  209 , a  1758a , a  2069 , a  2219 and a  2390 contain possible diffuse sources , which we indicate as uncertain .",
    "we found that the percentage of clusters showing diffuse sources is higher in clusters with high x - ray luminosity , being 6%-9% in clusters with l@xmath11 10@xmath12 erg s@xmath1 and 27%-44% in clusters with l@xmath13 10@xmath12 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , the diffuse cluster sources are not a rare phenomenon if x - ray luminous clusters are considered .",
    "we have found no correlation between the radio power of diffuse sources and the cluster x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , we note that the radio powers may be largely underestimated because of missing flux in the nvss images .",
    "finally , we note that the large majority of clusters hosting a radio halo do not contain a cooling flow .",
    "this reinforces the strong correlation between the absence of a cooling flow and the presence of a radio halo in clusters .",
    "this research has made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , caltech , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration ."
