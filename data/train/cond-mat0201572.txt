    "the electron spin precession phenomena at zero magnetic field induced by a variable spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) in 2deg systems was firstly proposed by datta and das @xcite as a way for the realization of the spin transistor . for this , the spin precession is controlled via the razhba soi associated with the interface electric field present in the gaas heterostructures that contains the 2deg channel @xcite @xmath0.\\ ] ] the reason of spin precession is that the spin operators do not commutate with the soi operator what leads to the spin evolution for electron transport .",
    "in particular the soi has a polarization effect on particle scattering processes @xcite and this effect was considered for different geometries of confinement of the 2deg @xcite .",
    "the most simple case of the stripe geometry with the x - axis along the stripe and the z - axis perpendicular to the stripe gives the following transformation of spin state after transmission @xmath1 where @xcite @xmath2 and @xmath3 is a length of the stripe .",
    "therefore , the razhba soi induces a spin precession of the transmitted electrons . notice that the spin precession is energy independent .",
    "this result is valid if the confinement energy @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a width of the stripe , is much larger than the spin - splitting energy induced by the soi , and therefore , the intersubband mixing is negligible @xcite . for the strong soi",
    "the spin rotation angle @xmath6 becomes to be the fermi energy depend for ballistic transport of electrons in the quasi one - dimensional wires and stripes @xcite .",
    "whatever the razhba soi leads to the spin precession in the @xmath7 plane . here",
    "we consider similar phenomena for electron transmission through the curved waveguide and quantum dots .",
    "the main difference between the straight waveguide and curved one is that the spin rotation is given by two angles .",
    "next , we find out conditions under which there is no a spin polarization of transmitted electrons .",
    "we imply that a flow of incident electrons have no spin polarization . by the spin polarization we consider the mean spin",
    "+ @xmath8 averaged over the electron flow .",
    "in particular for the transmission through quantum dot we show a principal role of the third lead for the spin polarization .",
    "we write the total hamiltonian of a confined 2deg as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the lateral confining potential . following to moroz and barnes",
    "@xcite we assume that the soi operator @xmath11 is formed by three contributions @xmath12 the first @xmath13 is related to the razhba soi ( [ soi ] ) , in which the soi constant @xmath14 proportional to the macroscopic interface - induced electric field is considered as constant .",
    "the second contribution @xmath15 to the soi comes from the electric field @xmath16 related to the confining potential .    in order to derive the second contribution to the soi we begin with general description of soi @xcite @xmath17 for microscopic electric field @xmath18 the second term in ( [ soigen ] ) equals zero .",
    "however for model cases of the confining potential @xmath10 the electric field can violate an equality @xmath19 . in this case",
    "the second term in ( [ soigen ] ) is necessary to provide a hermiticity of the total soi operator .    for a 2deg confined at semiconductor heterostructure interface we can reduce the z - coordinate performing average over electron wave function @xmath20 strongly localized along the z - direction @xmath21 as a result we obtain @xmath22 @xmath23 here electric field components",
    "are considering in a meaning of integral ( [ integral ] ) and depend on @xmath24 only .",
    "for particular case of straight wire directed along the y - axis with the lateral confining potential @xmath25 we obtain from ( [ soi2dd ] ) the expression given by moroz and barnes ( formula ( 5 ) in @xcite).they used a parabolic approximation for the confining potential . here",
    "we consider a popular hard wall approximation and imply the following confining potential @xmath26 then substituting the electric field @xmath27 into ( [ soi2dd ] ) we have @xmath28 for @xmath29 we have from the schrdinger equation the following solution @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the normalization constant . using a property of delta function that a difference between derivatives of the wave function at the right and left of the delta function is obeying to @xmath32 we have from ( [ psix ] ) that @xmath33 for @xmath34 .",
    "therefore in the hard wall approximation an effect of the second contribution @xmath15 limits to zero .",
    "next , for numerical computation of the transmission through the semiconductor heterostructure we assume a connection at least to two electrodes in which there is no the soi",
    ". then we can specify the electron state by quantum numbers , the number of the energy subband @xmath35 and spin projection @xmath36 .",
    "this assumption implies that far from waveguides or quantum dots the soi constant @xmath14 equals zero in the electrodes .",
    "neglecting by real space behavior of the microscopic electric field at the edge of the heterestructure we assume that the field is directed normal to the plane of the heterostructure everywhere and has a stepwise behavior at the edges . as a result",
    "we obtain the stepwise behavior for the razhba soi constant @xmath14 .",
    "such a model was used by hu and matsuyama @xcite .",
    "similar to ( [ soi2dd ] ) we obtain that the third contribution to the soi takes the following form @xmath37",
    "in this section we prove that the soi gives no spin polarization for electron transmission through arbitrary billiards if energy of incident electron belongs to the first energy subband . in dimensionless form",
    "the stationary schrdinger equation has the following form @xmath38 here @xmath39 , @xmath40 @xmath3 is a characteristic scale of the system , @xmath41 is the dimensionless soi constant . correspondingly in eqs ( [ se ] ) and ( [ soi2d ] ) coordinates @xmath24 are also dimensionless .",
    "let @xmath42 be an area of the structure under consideration which involves a billiard the soi and leads as shown in fig .",
    "[ curvfig1 ] .     has boundary @xmath43 which crosses input lead and output one at @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively . ]",
    "let @xmath43 denote a boundary which crosses input lead and output one at @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "we suppose that there is no spin - orbit interaction in the leads , _",
    "i.e _ @xmath46 at @xmath47 .",
    "at the rest of boundary @xmath43 we imply the dirichlet boundary conditions for solution of schrdinger equation ( [ se ] ) @xmath48 . as the scale @xmath3 we take @xmath49",
    ".    therefore we can write solution in the electrodes as follows @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the spin states defined spin projection along some axis , say , the z - axis",
    ". the energy is @xmath52 where @xmath53 numerates a number of the energy subbands .",
    "introduce complex derivatives @xmath54 we write the schrdinger equation ( [ se ] ) as follows @xmath55 where @xmath56 are the components of the spin state .",
    "assume that there is auxiliary degenerated state with components @xmath57 .",
    "in particular , it might be the kramers degenerated state .",
    "then , for these two states the green formula follows @xmath58 where @xmath35 is an exterior normal to the boundary @xmath43 .    from the schrdinger equation we have @xmath59 combining each couple of equations in ( [ uv ] ) we obtain @xmath60 @xmath61 extracting the second equation from the first one in ( [ uv1 ] ) we obtain @xmath62 @xmath63    integration of this equation over the billiard area @xmath42 with use of the green formula ( [ green ] ) gives the following @xmath64 @xmath65 since at @xmath43 either @xmath66 , or @xmath67 , the last two integrals in ( [ green1 ] ) equal zero and formula ( [ green1 ] ) can be rewritten as follows @xmath68 @xmath69 this formula is sufficient to establish some symmetry rules between ingoing and outgoing states .",
    "let us consider the first - channel transmission for @xmath70 .",
    "in order to ignore evanescent modes we will consider that boundaries @xmath71 cross the leads far from the scattering region as shown in fig .",
    "[ curvfig1 ] .",
    "let electron incidents from the input lead being completely spin polarized up .",
    "it means that for the incident state ( [ waves ] ) @xmath72 .",
    "we denote the corresponding state interior the structure @xmath42 as @xmath73 which is used as the u - solution in eq .",
    "( [ green2 ] ) .",
    "correspondingly @xmath74 denotes the v - solution in eq .",
    "( [ green2 ] ) for the case of electron incidenting with spin polarized down .",
    "we suppose that the boundaries @xmath44 and @xmath45 cross the leads normally the leads and the x - axis is parallel to the leads . hence the normal @xmath35 is parallel to the x - axis .",
    "then from ( [ waves ] ) at the boundary @xmath45 which crosses the output lead we obtain the following relations @xmath75 where function @xmath76 refers to all components @xmath77 .",
    "these relations allow to exclude the boundary @xmath45 from ( [ green2 ] ) . at the boundary @xmath44 which crosses the input",
    "lead we have @xmath78 we imply here that the origin of the @xmath24 coordinate system is at the boundary @xmath44 . substituting the relations ( [ gamma1 ] ) into eq ( [ green2 ] ) we obtain @xmath79    since at the boundary @xmath44 @xmath80 we obtain from ( [ gamma1next ] )",
    "@xmath81 thus from ( [ waves ] ) it follows that amplitudes of the reflection @xmath82    next , we take that the state @xmath83 coincides with the state @xmath84 in ( [ green2 ] ) .",
    "then equation ( [ green2 ] ) simplifies as follows @xmath85 substituting into this formula relations ( [ gamma1 ] ) we obtain @xmath86 it gives us that @xmath87 or according to ( [ waves ] ) @xmath88 .",
    "also similarly we obtain that @xmath89 at the boundary @xmath44 .",
    "thus we can write the second symmetry rule for reflection amplitudes @xmath90 from symmetry rules ( [ sym1 ] ) and ( [ sym2 ] ) and from the current preservation it follows that the transmission probabilities @xmath91 do not depend on the spin polarization of incident electron .",
    "till now we considered incident waves as spin polarized along the z - axis at the boundary @xmath44 .",
    "let now consider a flow of incident electrons which have no averaged spin polarization .",
    "in particular we can present that half of electrons have the incident state with spin up and half of electrons have the incident state with spin down .",
    "let us consider corresponding transmitted waves at the boundary @xmath45 .",
    "we prove that for a transmission through the billiard with two attached leads there is no averaged spin polarization , _ i.e. _ @xmath92 if electron incidents being spin unpolarized in the first energy subband .",
    "as previously we take the incident state in the form ( [ waves ] ) and write the states in leads as @xmath93 where the arrows up and down indicate that electron incident with spins up and down . we take in the green formulas ( [ green2 ] ) the first function @xmath94 as @xmath95 and the second function @xmath96 as @xmath97 where @xmath98 means a complex conjugation .",
    "it means that the second function is the kramers degenerated state .",
    "hence @xmath99    let us calculate integral ( [ green2 ] ) .",
    "at a boundary @xmath44 crossing the input lead the integral equals zero since in the input lead @xmath100 .",
    "the second contribution into integral ( [ green2 ] ) relates to the boundary @xmath45 crossing the output lead .",
    "using transmitted solution ( [ waves ] ) one can write eq .",
    "( [ green2 ] ) as follows @xmath101 @xmath102 therefore @xmath103 , or in terms of notations ( [ u1v1 ] ) @xmath104 from ( [ u2v2 ] ) it obviously follows @xmath105 moreover relation ( [ sym3 ] ) implies that @xmath106 ) give @xmath107    mean values of spin components in corresponding states ( [ states ] ) are the following @xmath108 eqs ( [ moduv ] ) - ( [ sigmaxyz ] ) give rise to @xmath109 _ i.e. _ the spin polarizations are exactly opposite in sign for transmission of electrons incidenting in corresponding spin polarized states .",
    "thus , for the transmission through any billiard with the soi with two attached leads the spin polarization does not exist if the flow of electrons incidents in the first energy subband and have no spin polarization . also , if there is no intersubband transmissions @xmath110 , the spin polarization equals zero for arbitrary energy .",
    "it takes place approximately , for example , for adiabatic structures similar to curved waveguides ( section v ) .",
    "however in a vicinity of edges of the energy subbands @xmath111 the soi gives rise to intersubband mixing . as a result",
    "we obtain in numerical calculations strong spin polarization near the edges . moreover ,",
    "if the billiard is connected to three or more leads , the spin polarization of transmitted electrons exists even for the transmission in the first energy subband .",
    "the effect of the third lead is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ curvfig2 ] .        hence this effect",
    "propose a way of the spin transistor complimentary to the way proposed by datta and das @xcite .",
    "the spin polarization of transmitted electrons can be governed by a value of connection of the third lead with the quantum dot .",
    "the most simple way is to apply local electric field in the vicinity of the connection which implies potential barrier closing the connection of the dot with the third lead .",
    "a model in which only the single channel transmission takes place is the one - dimensional wire .",
    "therefore for a transmission through the one - dimensional wire of any form the soi can not give rise to the spin polarization .",
    "however this model is interesting by that allows to find spin evolution analytically . a case of straight wire",
    "was considered by @xcite . here",
    "we consider a curved wire consisted of a segment of circle with radius @xmath112 attached to infinite straight one dimensional wires as shown in fig .",

    "we take a length of the segment as @xmath113 and a position coordinate as @xmath114 .",

    "one can obtain the following relation between the energy of electron @xmath124 and the wave number @xmath122 @xmath125 which gives @xmath126 the spectrum ( [ energy ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ curvfig4 ] .    ) for @xmath127 .",
    "values of @xmath122 corresponded to clockwise movement of electron along the curved wire are shown by thick points . ]    for fixed energy @xmath124 eq.([energy ] ) gives four solutions for the wave number @xmath122 .",
    "it is well known that @xcite for electron transmission through potential profile a reflection is negligibly small if the characteristic length of inhomogeneity much exceeds the wave length ( adiabatic regime ) . for our case",
    "we assume that the radius of curvature of the wire is much larger in comparison with the electron wave length .",
    "so we can ignore the reflection for electron transmission through the quasi one - dimensional waveguide .    since there is no reflection for transmission through the one - dimensional waveguide",
    "we need only those values of the wave number @xmath122 which correspond to clockwise movement of electron in the waveguide .",
    "we denote its as @xmath128 shown in fig .",
    "[ curvfig4 ] . in what follows we use the following relation between @xmath129 and @xmath130 : @xmath131    therefore general solution of the shcrdinger equation for the electron transmission without reflection can be written as follows @xmath132 where @xmath133 @xmath134    the matrix @xmath135 has the following form @xmath136    evolution of the electron state ( [ psi ] ) as length @xmath114 of the curved wire can be presented as @xmath137 @xmath138 where @xmath139    from eqs ( [ a1 ] ) and ( [ a2 ] ) we can rewrite ( [ lambda ] ) as follows @xmath140 and @xmath141    eq .",
    "( [ psi1 ] ) can be presented as @xmath142 which shows that the unitary matrix @xmath143 has a meaning of the transfer one . since the state @xmath144 is spinor one the matrix @xmath143 corresponds to rotation matrix for transport of electron along the wire . in general case",
    "the rotation matrix is given by the euler angles ( @xmath145 ) @xcite @xmath146 the rotation matrix @xmath112 has the following form @xmath147 @xmath148 in order to find the euler angles let us consider to which rotation corresponds matrix @xmath149 if the matrix @xmath150 were unit , the matrix @xmath151 would correspond to the rotation by the angle @xmath152 around the z - axis .",
    "the matrix @xmath150 in ( [ aux ] ) gives rise to the clockwise rotation around the x - axis by the angle @xmath6 which satisfies to the following equation @xmath153 in order to fulfill this equation we choose @xmath154 the angle @xmath155 is remaining undefined .",
    "below we put @xmath156 .",
    "let us choose new axis @xmath157 in the @xmath158 plane with the angle @xmath6 as the angle between the z - axis and @xmath157-axis .",
    "thus , the full rotation matrix consists of the anticlockwise rotation around the the @xmath157-axis by the angle @xmath159 and the clockwise rotation by the angle @xmath160 around the z - axis .",
    "the last statement follows from the matrix @xmath135 in eq.([psi1 ] ) .",
    "a knowledge of the evolution of the spin state ( [ psi1 ] ) as dependent on the length @xmath161 of the curved waveguide gives us a possibility to calculate in particular evolution of the spin components .",
    "the result of calculation is shown in fig .",

    "as seen the results of numerical computation for the two - dimensional curved waveguide are surprisingly close to present one - dimensional model .",
