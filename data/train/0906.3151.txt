    "although it has been known for 150 years that electric resistance of a magnetic metal depends on the direction of magnetization,@xcite the origin of such dependence is often explained only vaguely as an interplay of spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) and magnetization .",
    "conceptual questions around this phenomenon , the anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) , remain open and relate to the quest for its detailed mechanism , its sign and specific magnitude . our ability to control the amr by material design , with potential impact on new electronic devices,@xcite",
    "would be improved if we had answers more specific but nevertheless still more universal than `` black - box - like '' modelling of amr in each and every deemable system .",
    "several factors obstruct a clearer insight into the phenomenon : there are many electronic bands crossing the fermi level in most materials and the amr of a crystalline material has various contributions of different symmetries . ab initio calculations performed in feni@xcite and feco@xcite disordered alloys agree reasonably well with experimentally determined amr but they do not allow for any detailed conclusions about its mechanisms . on the other hand , the model@xcite of current - carrying @xmath2-states scattered to spin - orbit - coupled @xmath1-states provides a relatively transparent picture of the amr@xcite but requires the fitting of one or more phenomenological parameters and even then a clear - cut correspondence to ab initio results for ferromagnetic transition metals could not be established.@xcite    [ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]     we thus find that the relative strength of the coulomb scattering increases with decreasing hole density , @xmath3 , due to the screened long - range nature of the coulomb interaction which contrasts the short range of the magnetic scattering .",
    "namely , the momentum transfers @xmath4 scale down with @xmath5 and we increasingly get to feel the singularity of @xmath6 at @xmath7 even though it is rounded by the screening , see eq .",
    "( [ eq-04c ] ) . assuming a value @xmath8 which is realistic in ( ga , mn)as , we have @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .    equation  ( [ eq-11 ] ) provides the link between @xmath12 and @xmath0 which is determined by @xmath13 , i.e. between horizontal axes of figs .",
    "[ fig-05](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "qualitatively , increasing @xmath13 and thus also increasing @xmath5 implies decreasing @xmath12 because the scattering rate due to the magnetic part scales @xmath14 while the scattering rate due to the coulomb scattering given by @xmath15 of eq .",
    "( [ eq-04c ] ) grows considerably slower .",
    "if we estimate @xmath16 by @xmath17 , the growth will be only @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the effective bohr radius in gaas .",

    "for @xmath21 we get @xmath22 the proportionality factor is @xmath23 times squared fermi velocity times the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "conductivities of the two bands are equal , so that @xmath24 and the same result with @xmath25 replaced by @xmath26 applies for @xmath27 .    in order to evaluate @xmath28",

    "[ fig-05](b ) .    both models with simplified scattering operator @xmath32 exhibit qualitatively the same behaviour of amr as a function of @xmath12 : positive amr for @xmath12 close to zero , sign change to negative amr already for a small value of @xmath12 , maximum amr magnitude at @xmath33 , and vanishing amr for @xmath34 .",
    "a comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig-05](a ) and ( b ) reveals that the outstanding feature of the amr at @xmath35 makes its way in eq .",
    "( [ eq-02 ] ) , the theoretical amr depends on the mn doping @xmath13 only through the carrier density @xmath36=0.22\\times x[\\%]$ ] , because @xmath37 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq-03 ] ) drops out in eq .",
    "( [ eq-07 ] ) .",
    "this fact should not be taken _ ad absurdum _ ( @xmath38 ) because we still assume that the substitutional mn impurities provide the dominant source of scattering .",
    "presence of other concurrent types of impurities ( which is important when we compare the calculated amr to experiments@xcite ) will make the amr depend on the ratio between their concentration and @xmath37 .",
    "nevertheless , this interplay will not simply obey matthiessen s rule since we deal with anisotropic systems.@xcite ] up to the full spherical model where it is becomes broadened to the wide maximum ( around @xmath39 in fig .",
    "[ fig-04 ] ) . based on the model that employs @xmath32 of eq .",
    "( [ eq-08 ] ) , we now analyze the origin of the very large negative amr at @xmath35 .",
    "this maximum amr value follows from the diverging conductivity @xmath40 given by eqs .",
    "( [ eq-16a ] ) or  ( [ eq-17 ] ) which is caused by vanishing scattering rate @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "the scattering matrix element in eq .",
    "( [ eq-04 ] ) vanishes for any @xmath43 , and so does the integral  ( [ eq-05 ] ) , when @xmath44 is an eigenstate to @xmath32 with eigenvalue zero ; for illustrative purposes , consider @xmath45 , i.e. @xmath46 pointing to the right in terms of fig .  [ fig-01 ] .",
    "the absence of scattering occurs for @xmath33 when @xmath20 is parallel to the @xmath13-direction , as evident@xcite from the spin texture in fig .",
    "[ fig-01](b ) .",
    "such infinite conductivity will of course not occur in realistic systems ; as soon as the dependences on momentum transfer of the electric and magnetic parts of the scattering potential will not be exactly the same , the eigenstate property of @xmath44 is lost .",
    "this is the case when we replace @xmath32 by the original @xmath47 of eqs .",
    "( [ eq-04b],[eq-04c ] ) . however , as fig .",
    "[ fig-05](a ) shows , there still remains a maximum in @xmath40 which translates into a maximum of @xmath48 as a fingerprint of the original @xmath40 singularity .",
    "positive amr for purely magnetic scattering ( @xmath49 ) that follows from eq .",
    "( [ eq-14 ] ) can also be understood using the basic properties of spin-3/2 states.@xcite the idea is that @xmath44 is an eigenstate ( with non - zero eigenvalue ) to @xmath50 for @xmath20 oriented along @xmath46 thereby allowing scattering to a state with @xmath51 that contributes strongly to the transport relaxation rate of eq .",
    "( [ eq-03 ] ) . on the other hand , matrix elements of @xmath52 vanish@xcite between states with @xmath53 and scatterring and resistivity",
    "are therefore suppressed for the magnetization perpendicular to the current .",
    "relation @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) for @xmath49 , obtained from the above analysis of the leading scattering channels which contribute to transport , is confirmed by calculations that even take into account all final states @xmath56 for the scattering and include the integration over all @xmath20-states in eq .",
    "( [ eq-05 ] ) .",
    "the sign of the amr changes quickly from positive to negative when adding the electric component of the scattering potential . in the model of short range potentials , summarized by eq .",
    "( [ eq-14 ] ) , it occurs at @xmath57 .",
    "recall that for realistic impurities with screened long - range coulomb potential the transition can be triggered by changing hole density , as explained in the discussion of fig .",

    ", we recall that all considerations in this work are based on the rta .",
    "it has been shown in ref .   that the rta does not provide the exact solution to the boltzmann equation . even in the simple case of a spherical model in ( ga ,",
    "mn)as we should solve an integral equation rather than merely evaluate integrals as in eq .",
    "( [ eq-03 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , it has also been argued in ref .   that the basic qualitative trends of the amr can be found already on the level of the rta . in particular this applies to the maximum of @xmath48 at @xmath35 whose robustness was verified by comparing the rta and the exact solution of the boltzmann equation in its integral form on model rashba - dresselhaus soi systems .",
    "non - crystalline anisotropic magnetoresistance ( amr ) is governed only by the angle between magnetization and current rather than by their orientation with respect to crystallographic axes , as opposed to the crystalline amr .",
    "the physical origin of the amr is the combination of spin - orbit interaction ( soi ) and of the broken symmetry due to the presence of magnetization .",
    "more specifically , three distinct mechanisms may lead to the non - crystalline amr : fermi surfaces distorted from the spherical shape that imply anisotropic fermi velocities , and anisotropic scattering rates , either due to anisotropic wavefunctions or due to the anisotropic scatterers .",
    "we note that the @xmath2-@xmath1 model which is sometimes invoked to qualitatively explain the amr in ferromagnetic transition metals , is a variation of the anisotropic wavefunction mechanism . because of the competing effect of the soi and magnetization ( which are both present only in the low - mobility @xmath1 states ) one may expect weak amr .",
    "on the other hand , we have shown that ( ga , mn)as constitutes a textbook example of a system where strong amr can be expected since the two agents are mostly separated : polarized mn ions act as anisotropic scatterers while the current - carrying valence - band states bring in the soi .",
    "quantitatively , the latter are also partly polarized but we have demonstrated that for the typical experimental range of mn dopings in metallic ( ga , mn)as samples ( @xmath58 ) , the anisotropic scatterer mechanism is dominant . a simple model which neglects the other two mechanisms provides analytical results which predict the correct sign of the amr ( resistivity parallel to magnetization is smaller than perpendicular to magnetization ) and identify its origin  destructive interference between electric and magnetic part of the scattering potential ( of ionized mn acceptors ) for carriers moving parallel to magnetization .    we gratefully acknowledge jan maek for his advice regarding the range of validity of the model in sec .",
