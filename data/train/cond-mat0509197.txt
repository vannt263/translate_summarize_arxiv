    "modern nanotechnology has provided a possibility to fabricate electronic devices in which the acting element is a single , organic molecule .",
    "this leads to a growing interest in the study of transport properties of molecular devices@xcite .",
    "such a device may be modeled as a ` quantum dot ' ( qd ) weakly coupled to the macroscopic charge reservoirs .",
    "in addition to their practical applications these artificial , tunable devices such as electronic components@xcite , coulomb blockade structures@xcite , diodes@xcite or switching devices with high negative differential resistance6 , are important for understanding the basic physics including the many - body and the size effects . in contrast to the semiconductor qds , molecules ( the linear size is at least one order smaller than that of the former ) are intrinsically different from semiconductor nanostructures .",
    "the devices with molecules may lead to new physics especially when electrons are added or removed from a single - molecule . since the molecular material possesses much smaller elastic parameters it is very easy to excite their internal , vibrational degrees of freedom ( phonon modes ) @xcite when electrons are incident upon the molecules through a tunnel junction .",
    "thus molecules react inevitably back to the tunnel electrons even at low temperature .",
    "this phenomenon has now provoked a large amount of experimental @xciteinvestigations in the problem of transport through mesoscopic systems with electron- phonon coupling .",
    "inelastic scattering effects have been observed directly in measurements of the differential conductance of molecules adsorbed on metallic substrates with scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm)@xcite . in a series of pioneering experiments by park _ _",
    "et al__@xcite  _  _ it was shown that the current through a single @xmath0 molecule was strongly influenced by the vibrational mode .",
    "et al_.@xcite have also demonstrated that the low - bias conductance of molecules is dominated by resonant tunneling through coupled electronic and vibrational levels .",
    "there has been a number of theoretical efforts @xcite focused on the effects of electron - phonon(e - ph ) coupling in mesoscopic systems with basic models capturing the essential physics and standard methods .",
    "various aspects of the electron - phonon / vibron interaction effect on the tunneling through molecule qds have been studied by many authors .    on the other hand , motivated by the easy control of electron - spin as well as the remarkably long coherence time ,",
    "the spin - polarization dependent transports in open qds @xcite have attracted considerable attentions .",
    "these spin - source devices not only exhibit the new fundamental physics but also are of promising applications in the emerging technologies of spintronics and quantum information@xcite .",
    "a pure spin current has been reported by direct optical injection without generating a net charge current@xcite .",
    "theoretically , there are number of mechanisms proposed to produce pure spin - current@xcite using techniques of ferromagnetic resonance in a ferromagnetic - normal - metal@xcite or electron spin resonance(esr ) in a qd - based system with sizable zeeman splitting@xcite .    moreover , a modern trend of the transport studies in mesocopic systems is toward not only to considering the transport characteristics of a given device but also to examining the noise properties . due to the discrete nature of charge carriers , electrical current through a conductor",
    "is subject to time - dependent fluctuation around its mean value which manifests the consequence of the quantization of the charge carriers and is usually referred to as the shot noise in literature@xcite . shot noise defined as the mean - square fluctuations of the current flowing through a given terminal at zero temperature",
    "is of great importance and interest because the spectrum of shot noise contains additional information about the interactions which the conduction electrons undergo@xcite beyond the mean - current properties and can be used to discern different mechanisms resulting in the same mean current . for example , shot noise experiments can determine the kinetics of electron and reveal information of the correlation of electronic wave functions .",
    "thus it has been extensively studied in a wide variety of systems@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the spin - resolving current correlation is more useful to describe electron correlation , because the electronic wavepacket with opposite spins is uninfluenced by the pauli exclusion principle and only reflects unambiguous information about the interaction .",
    "for a two - lead device , correlations can be formulated by quantities measured at the same lead i.e. the auto - correlation , or by quantities measured at the two different leads , namely , the cross - correlation .",
    "b@xmath1ttiker@xcite pointed out that while cross - correlations of the charge noise can either be positive or negative for bosons , they are necessarily negative definite for fermions in both the equilibrium and the transport regimes .",
    "it has been well known@xcite that anti - bunching in a fermionic system gives rise to negative definite cross - correlation for charge - current . and the conservation of charge forces the cross correlation and auto correlation of charge - current noise spectra to differ by just a minus sign in a two - probe system .",
    "however for a pure spin - current the situation is very different because of a lack of spin - current conservation due to the spin flipping .",
    "the auto - correlation of the spin - current is surely positive definite , while the cross - correlation is either positive or negative depending on a number of parameters@xcite .",
    "the zero - frequency shot noise @xmath2 for a classical conductor@xcite is characterized by the poisson value @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the average current , while the shot noise in a non - interacting mesoscopic conductor is always reduced by the pauli exclusion in comparison with the poisson value .",
    "of course , shot noise is also influenced by other factors such as electron - electron and electron - phonon interactions .",
    "motivated by the achievements in the single - molecule and spin - current experiments we in this paper will , based on the esr mechanism @xciteof generating net spin - current@xcite , investigate the electron - phonon effects on the spin - current and its shot noise which have not yet been studied theoretically for molecular dots .",
    "we use the keldysh nonequilibrium green function technique to calculate the spin current and shot noise through a single - molecule coupled to electron reservoirs for the first time and focus on the effect of inelastic scattering process . the esr - type model with a single dispersionless phonon mode",
    "is employed to address the vibrational degrees of freedom in the molecular dot .",
    "all other complexity of real molecular devices , apart from interaction with a single longitudinal optical(lo ) phonon localized on the molecule , is ignored .",
    "the model system under consideration is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 , which consists of a molecule of one relevant level coupled with a single ( einstein ) phonon mode and two leads which we label as ` left ' and ` right ' .",
