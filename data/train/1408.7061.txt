    "due to the large electric dipole moments , there are strong and long - range interactions between rydberg atoms and these interactions can be controlled and enhanced by external electromagnetic fields .",
    "besides , the huge polarizability of rydberg states gives rise to giant kerr coefficients @xcite , allowing nonlinear optical effects for only a few photons @xcite .",
    "that is why the atoms excited to the high - lying rydberg states are of great interest in the recent researches of quantum many - body physics @xcite , quantum information processing @xcite and quantum nonlinear optics @xcite .    the high - lying rydberg states can be a bit more easily excited from atomic ground states by laser light via absorption of more than one photon @xcite , while the spontaneous emission of the intermediary states will introduce the dissipative mechanism into the rydberg excitation schemes in spite of the long life of the rydberg states @xcite .",
    "in general , these environment - induced dissipations inevitably lead to decoherence and noise in the quantum system and thus are undesirable in the above quantum physics researches .    in recent years , however , the dissipation has been altered its role into a useful resource and tool for a lot of quantum applications , such as dissipative state engineering in trapped ions @xcite and cold atoms @xcite , dissipative quantum computation @xcite , dissipative quantum optics @xcite , bound state formation in molecules @xcite and entangled steady state production @xcite .",
    "the key for these applications is the occurrence of `` non - equilibrium stationary state '' which can be achieved when the driving and dissipative processes arrive at a dynamical equilibrium @xcite . by appropriately arranging the system - environment couplings",
    ", these steady states can deviate far from the classical thermal equilibrium states and keep unique quantum features resisting decoherences @xcite .",
    "moreover , combining with the strong dipole - dipole interaction and blockade mechanics of the rydberg atoms , the dissipation could give rise to quite a few exotic phases of ultracold many - body atomic system , such as uniform phase , antiferromagetic phase , oscillatory phase and even the bistability between these phases @xcite .",
    "in this work we investigate the effect of dissipation on the steady states and dynamics of multi - photon rydberg excitation schemes . to focus on the dissipation induced by the spontaneous emission of the intermediary states , we choose two typical four - level schemes : one level structure is @xmath0-type and the other is cascade . by appropriately arranging the laser fields , these two schemes have exactly the same coherent dynamics .",
    "however , if including the effect of dissipation their realistic dynamics are of great difference , since a dissipative channel due to sponaneous decay running in the opposite direction in the two schemes .",
    "we compare their non - equilibrium steady states by solving the stationary master equations under the mean - field treatment , and find that the number and distribution of their steady state solutions are entirely different when the rydberg nonlinear interaction is strong .",
    "the bistable steady states are present in the the @xmath0-type scheme while the autler - townes splitting ( ats ) occurs in the cascade scheme resulting in the tri - stable steady states . as a consequence , for a strong nonlinear system such as rydberg atom systems",
    ", dissipative force should be considered very carefully since the final steady states of the system will be very sensitive to it . furthermore , we study the dynamical evolution of the two schemes in the bistable region . due to",
    "the difference in the dissipative channel , we observe two schemes may evolute into different branches under the same initial conditions , which makes sense for dissipative preparation of quantum state in strong nonlinear interacting systems .",
    "-type and cascade atomic multi - level systems .",
    "states @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively show the ground state , two intermediate states and rydberg state , which are successively coupled by laser rabi frequencies @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the three - photon laser detuning @xmath8 can be controlled in experiment .",
    "other parameters are described in the text . ]    in what follows , we will discuss two different multi - step cw - excitation schemes for the rydberg state , as typically used in experiments .",
    "one is an @xmath0-type scheme with a raman transition before a rydberg - excited transition , as shown in fig .",
    "[ model_scheme](a ) .",
    "the atom is first excited from its ground state @xmath9 to an intermediate state @xmath10 with a transition strength given by the rabi frequency @xmath11 , and then transits to a metastable state @xmath12 with rabi frequency @xmath13 .",
    "finally , another laser drives the transition between the metastable level and the desired rydberg state @xmath14 with rabi frequency @xmath15 .",
    "the photon for the raman transition is typically provided by the mot lasers , which are tuned on resonance with the levels during the time of rydberg excitation .",
    "so the spontaneous emissions from the intermediate state @xmath10 to state @xmath9 with rate @xmath16 and to state @xmath12 with rate @xmath17 , respectively , have to be taken into account . on the other hand ,",
    "we allow for a detuning @xmath18 from resonant rydberg excitation and the lifetime of the rydberg state is much longer ( typically as large as tens of @xmath19s with the principle quantum number @xmath20 ) so that its decay can be safely neglected in our discussion . the second scheme shown in fig .",
    "[ model_scheme](b ) has a cascade level structure , where @xmath12 represents the higher intermediate state , so that @xmath17 is the decay rate from state @xmath12 to state @xmath10 , opposite to the case in the first scheme .",
    "the physical meanings of the other quantities remain unchanged .",
    "besides , we note that in this scheme decay from state @xmath3 to state @xmath1 is physically forbidden according to the transition selection rule . except the atom - light interaction",
    ", we also consider the strong interaction between rydberg atoms ( here we only consider a homogeneous van - der - waals interaction ) , which under the mean field approximation will cause a population - dependent energy shift to the rydberg state",
    ".    mean field theory is a classical approximation to the quantum model in which quantum correlations between atoms are ignored .",
    "note that it works well only with large atom number @xcite . for systems of several rydberg atoms , the quantum effect of the strong rydberg blockade can no longer be effectively described by the mean field approximation @xcite . in our consideration , we assume that the number of atom is large enough so that the mean field approach can be safely used .    in frames rotating at appropriate frequencies respectively , these two different rydberg - excitation schemes can be described by a same mean - filed hamiltonian ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 with @xmath23 being the corresponding transition operator between two internal atomic states , @xmath24 the rydberg interaction strength , and @xmath25 the rydberg state population .",
    "the only difference is the expression of the three - photon detuning , given by @xmath26 with frequencies @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 denoting the energy of state @xmath31 , the carrier frequencies of the fields @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the upper sign is for the @xmath0-type scheme and the lower one for the cascade scheme .",
    "that means the coherent dynamics of these two schemes can be same even they have different structures of energy levels , provided the three - photon detunings are equal .",
    "however , we will show below in a realistic experiment where the dissipation caused by the spontaneous decay should be considered , these schemes will display distinct non - equilibrium steady states and dynamics , which is attributed to the opposite direction of decay route between level @xmath3 and level @xmath2 in two schemes .    in order to investigate the influences of the spontaneous emissions from the intermediate excited states , we use the lindblad master equation @xcite @xmath32 + \\mathcal{l}\\left [ \\hat{\\rho}\\right ] ,",

    "the effective detuning @xmath44 , including the population - dependent frequency shift of the rydberg state , which makes the differential equations nonlinear .",
    "we can find these two groups of equations become identical when the decay @xmath45 , which means the dynamics of the two schemes are indistinguishable .",
    "instead , a non - vanishing @xmath17 will lead to entirely different excitation dynamics , especially in the regions with high nonlinearity induced by rydberg - rydberg interaction . to show these differences in the following we will keep the common decay @xmath16 constant and focus on the influence of the decay @xmath17 which has opposite direction in the two schemes .",
    "then it is also convenient to renormalize the time by @xmath46 and all frequencies by @xmath16 in the equations .",
    "we first investigate the steady states of the schemes , where the competition between the oscillation caused by coherent optical driving and the dissipation due to the spontaneous emissions reaches a dynamical equilibrium so that the populations and the coherence for each level become stationary .",
    "the steady occupancy of the rydberg state , @xmath47 , can then be readily obtained by setting all time differential terms in eq .",
    "( [ ntypef ] ) and ( [ cascadetyf ] ) equal zero and then solving the resulting algebraic equations . for the @xmath0-type scheme",
    ", we obtain a cubic equation about @xmath47 which may have one or three solutions corresponding to the uniform and the bistable phase of the rydberg excitation scheme , respectively ( we should check the stabilities of these solutions to ensure they are achievable in the dissipation environment ) . here the bistable phase , as a typical nonlinear effect , is caused by the rydberg - rydberg interaction .",

    "( all parameters are scaled by @xmath16.),width=316,height=336 ]    from the figure we can find the two schemes have similar phase diagrams at small decay strength ( see the first row , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "the parameter space is dominated by the uniform phase , the bistable phase presents for small rabi frequency @xmath15 , and the oscillatory phase only survives in a very narrow region where detuning @xmath18 is small . for a large value of @xmath17 ( the second row , @xmath56 and @xmath55 ) ,",
    "the phase diagrams become distinct from each other . in the case of the @xmath0-type scheme",
    "the oscillatory phase occupies a large area with larger value of @xmath15 , that is because the non - lossy states , @xmath3 and @xmath31 , sustain a rabi - type population oscillation between them .",
    "instead , in the case of the cascade scheme the decay of state @xmath3 prevents such oscillation .",
    "moreover , ats of the cascade system causes a unique tri - stable phase ( we will show it clearly below ) which is absent in the former case @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that the effect of dissipation - sensitive steady states is more remarkable under the condition of strong nonlinearity .",
    "when we decrease the rydberg - rydberg interaction strength , the phase diagrams of the two schemes trends to be analogous even for large value of decay ( the third row , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .",

    "the dashed curves corresponds to the values in the unstable phases .",

    "[ phase_diagram](b ) and ( e ) , we observe that the rydberg excitation spectrum in the cascade scheme shows a double - peak structure separated by @xmath64 which is same as the feature of the ats presenting in the three - level rydberg - excitation scheme @xcite . in our @xmath0-type scheme ,",
    "the same direction of decay @xmath17 and @xmath16 makes the atoms populate mostly on state @xmath65 and @xmath66 , resulting in the splitting of the rydberg excitation spectrum .",
    "moreover , different from in the three - level scheme where ats is just an effect of transient stability @xcite , the existence of the intermediate state @xmath67 here has stabilized this splitting and enabled it to appear in the final steady state of the scheme . in the case of the @xmath0-type scheme",
    ", the opposite directions of decays @xmath17 and @xmath16 , as well as small rabi frequency @xmath13 , may accumulate the population on state @xmath3 only , giving rise to a single peak instead of the ats in the rydberg excitation spectrum .",
    "these different peak structures still remain in the presence of rydberg - rydberg interactions . as we shown in fig .",
    "[ rydberg_popu](a)-(h ) , the nonlinearity caused by the interaction distorts the original spectrum , resulting in the different multi - stable steady states of the cascade and the @xmath0-type schemes .",
    "again the right column of fig .",

    "[ phase_diagram](b ) .",
    "we can find different features of the bistable behaviors in these two cases .",
    "when @xmath68 is small it exhibits intrinsic bistability in the region of @xmath69 with its inclined direction of hysteresis window depending on the sign of rydberg interaction @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath8 is negative or large positive ( i.e. @xmath70 is off - resonance ) , the ground states @xmath3 is occupied with a dominant number of atoms ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "however , as increasing @xmath7 to @xmath72 we find that the dominant population at @xmath73 occupies the rydberg state @xmath31 with its value @xmath74 due to a quite strong rydberg excitation . meanwhile , a small region of bistable phase emerges near @xmath75 where the rydberg interaction induced energy shift has been compensated by a large detuning i.e. @xmath76 . besides ,",
    "when @xmath15 is large , there is a large unstable region ( corresponding to the oscillatory phase ) denoted by the dashed lines , which is due to the strong coupling between the non - lossy states @xmath3 and @xmath31 .    turning to the case of the cascade system ( the right column of fig .",
    "[ rydberg_popu ] ) , a dramatic difference is the presence of the inclined double - peak configuration at small @xmath15 case , which gives rise to bistable and even tri - stable phases when @xmath8 and @xmath77 are comparable . in addition , state @xmath1 and state @xmath2 share the most atomic population ( @xmath78 ) and the case does not change much even for larger value of @xmath7 .",
    "however , the double - peak structure degenerates a lot so that there is no multi - stable phase in large @xmath15 case .",
    "this is due to the comparable values of @xmath11 and @xmath15 prevent the occurrence of the ats .",
    "summarizing , for the @xmath0-type scheme , decay @xmath17 leads to a large population on state @xmath3 which , combining with rydberg state @xmath31 , makes the scheme work like a two - level system , so that the sustained rabi - typed oscillation occurs with an intensive @xmath7 . for small @xmath7",
    "the behavior of the scheme is more close to the cooperative optical excitation @xcite . for the cascade scheme",
    ", the existence of @xmath79 leads to the ats phenomenon , inducing multi - stable steady state phases under the condition of strong nonlinear interaction .",
    "the above phase diagrams reveal the properties of the steady states in the parameter space of detuning @xmath18 and rabi frequency @xmath15 , which are controlled by the external lasers . specially , owing to the strong nonlinear interactions the bistable phases present , which suggests there are two different steady states , i.e. , the low- and the high - rydberg - occupied steady state , under the same laser parameters . in reality , the system would eventually evolute into one of them , which depends on the initial states and decay routes . in order to study this dependence , we perform a numerical simulation for the population dynamics by directly solving the obes ( [ ntypef ] ) and ( [ cascadetyf ] ) .    ) for ( a ) the @xmath0-type system and ( b ) the cascade system , as a function of initial population on @xmath80 state ( @xmath81 ) and @xmath82 state ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "dark and light colors represent the low and high rydberg - state occupancy , respectively .",
    "the colorless regions are unstable and without stationary solutions .",
    "( c ) and ( d ) show population evolution in the bistable region for the @xmath0-type system and the cascade system , respectively , where @xmath84 , and @xmath85 ( dashed blue line ) and @xmath86 ( solid black line ) .",

[ phase_diagram](b ) and ( e ) where the bistable steady state gives two stationary rydberg populations @xmath89 ( low ) and @xmath90 ( high ) for the @xmath0-type scheme , and @xmath91 ( low ) and @xmath92 ( high ) for the cascade scheme , respectively .",
    "since the rydberg state @xmath31 is not subjected to the dissipation in our model , we fix its initial population by @xmath93 for the @xmath0-type scheme and @xmath94 for the cascade scheme , and then focus on the dependence of its final population on the initial population of state @xmath1 and @xmath3 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ dynamics](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "note that the total particle is always conserved , @xmath95 .    from fig .",
    "[ dynamics ] we can find difference between the two schemes in the side of small @xmath96 , which means state @xmath2 and state @xmath97 are largely occupied at the initial time .",
    "for the cascade system whose @xmath79 is large and @xmath96 is small , it is hard to pump atoms into the highly excited state @xmath31 .",
    "however , in the @xmath0-type system dissipations from @xmath2 may create strong atomic correlations between @xmath1 , @xmath98 and @xmath3 ( e.g. a raman scattering process @xcite ) , giving rise to an enhancement for population in state @xmath3 .",
    "it is therefore possible to realize a high rydberg excitation .",
    "the final populations @xmath99 for the @xmath0-type scheme and @xmath100 for the cascade scheme .    on the other side when @xmath96 is large , since state @xmath3",
    "is directly coupled with state @xmath31 by laser @xmath7 , the rydberg excitation is easy .",
    "the final populations @xmath101 for the @xmath0-type scheme , where the population in @xmath3 and @xmath31 are dominant .",
    "for the cascade scheme , due to the effect of decay @xmath79 and @xmath102 the situation is different .",
    "we have @xmath103 , where the populations of state @xmath1 and @xmath98 are not small .    except for the above two sides , in the middle region , both of the schemes tend to a low rydberg occupancy with @xmath104 for the @xmath0-type scheme , corresponding to a dominant final occupancy of state @xmath3 , and with @xmath105 for the cascade scheme , indicating a population sharing between states @xmath1 and @xmath98",
    ".    finally , we emphasis that even the final values of the rydberg population are close , the dynamical evolution process and therefore the time spent on achieving the final stationary states are much different for the two schemes . in fig .",
    "[ dynamics](c ) and ( d ) , we show their different population dynamics for the rydberg state in the bistable region under the same experimental parameters .",
    "in contrast to the case of the cascade scheme , the @xmath0-type scheme is subjected to a strong population oscillation while tending towards the high branch of rydberg occupancy and it requires more time to reach steady state .",
    "this result agrees with our former analysis of bistability as in fig .",
