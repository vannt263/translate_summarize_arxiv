    "synchronization of nonlinear systems , particularly chaotic systems has attracted the attention of many researchers for several decades @xcite . during recent years interest in controlled synchronization",
    "has increased , partly driven by a growing interest in the application of control theory methods in physics @xcite .",
    "the design of links interconnecting parts of complex systems to enable synchronization was studied in @xcite . these and related papers explore the possibility of modification of complex dynamical system behavior by means of feedback action .    modifying the behavior of complex interconnected systems and networks",
    "has attracted considerable interest .",
    "the available results significantly depend on models of interconnection between nodes . in some works",
    "the interconnections are modeled as delay elements .",
    "however , the spatial separation between nodes means that modeling connections via communication channels with limited capacity is more realistic .",
    "hence analysis of the overall system should include both dynamical and information aspects .",
    "recently the limitations of control under constraints imposed by a finite capacity information channel have been investigated in detail in the control theory literature , see @xcite and references and the references therein .",
    "it has been shown that stabilization under information constraints is possible if and only if the capacity of the information channel exceeds the entropy production of the system at the equilibrium @xcite . in @xcite a general statement",
    "was proposed , claiming that the difference between the entropies of the open loop and the closed loop systems can not exceed the information introduced by the controller , including the transmission rate of the information channel .",
    "however , results of the previous works on control systems analysis under information constraints do not apply to synchronization systems since in a synchronization problem trajectories in the phase space converge to a set ( a manifold ) rather than to a point , i.e. the problem can not be reduced to simple stabilization .",
    "the first results on synchronization under information constraints were presented in @xcite , where the so called observer - based synchronization scheme @xcite was considered . in this paper",
    "we extend this work and analyze a controlled synchronization scheme for two nonlinear systems .",
    "a major difficulty with the controlled synchronization problem arises because the coupling is implemented in a restricted manner via the control signal .",
    "key tools used to solve the problem are quadratic lyapunov functions and passification methods borrowed from control theory . to reduce technicalities",
    "we restrict our analysis by lurie systems ( linear part plus nonlinearity depending only on measurable outputs ) .",
    "consider two identical dynamical systems modeled in lurie form ( i.e. the right hand sides are split into a linear part and a nonlinear part which depends only on the measurable outputs ) .",
    "let one of the systems be controlled by a scalar control function @xmath0 whose action is restricted by a vector of control efficiencies @xmath1 .",
    "the controlled system model is as follows : @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are @xmath5-dimensional ( column ) vectors of state variables ; @xmath6 , @xmath7 are scalar output variables ; @xmath8 is an @xmath9-matrix ; @xmath1 is @xmath10 ( column ) matrix ; @xmath11 is an @xmath12 ( row ) matrix , @xmath13 is a continuous nonlinearity , acting in the span of control ; vectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 stand for time - derivatives of @xmath3 , @xmath4 correspondingly . system ( [ 2 ] ) is called _ master _ ( _ leader _ ) _ system _ , while the controlled system ( [ 1 ] ) is _ slave system _ ( _ follower _ ) .",
    "our goal is to evaluate limitations imposed on the synchronization precision by limited the transmission rate between the systems .",
    "the intermediate problem is to find a control function @xmath16 depending on measurable variables such that the synchronization error @xmath17 where @xmath18 becomes small as @xmath19 becomes large .",
    "we are also interested in the value of output synchronization error @xmath20 @xmath21 .",
    "a key difficulty arises because the output of the master system is not available directly but only through a communication channel with limited capacity .",
    "this means that the signal @xmath6 must be coded at the transmitter side and codewords are then transmitted with only a finite number of symbols per second thus introducing some error .",
    "we assume that the observed signal @xmath6 is coded with symbols from a finite alphabet at discrete sampling time instants @xmath22 , @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the sampling time .",
    "let the coded symbol @xmath25=\\bar { y}_1 ( t_k)$ ] be transmitted over a digital communication channel with a finite capacity . to simplify the analysis",
    ", we assume that the observations are not corrupted by observation noise ; transmission delay and transmission channel distortions may be neglected .",
    "therefore , the discrete communication channel with sampling period @xmath24 is considered , but it is assumed that the coded symbols are available at the receiver side at the same sampling instant @xmath26 , as they are generated by the coder .",
    "assume that _ zero - order extrapolation _ is used to convert the digital sequence @xmath27 $ ] to the continuous - time input of the response system @xmath28 , namely , that @xmath29 $ ] as @xmath30 .",
    "then the _ transmission error _ is defined as follows : @xmath31 on the receiver side the signal is decoded introducing additional error and the controller can use only the signal @xmath32 instead of @xmath33 .",
    "a block diagram of the system is shown in fig .  [ stuc_contra ] .",
    "is transmitted over the channel).,width=321 ]    we restrict consideration to simple control functions in the form of static linear feedback @xmath34 where @xmath20 @xmath35 denotes an output synchronization error , @xmath36 is a scalar controller gain .",
    "the problem of finding static output feedback even for linear systems is one of the classical problems of control theory .",
    "although substantial effort has been devoted to its solution and various necessary and sufficient conditions for stabilizability by static output feedback have been obtained , most existing conditions are not testable practically @xcite .",
    "since we are dealing with a nonlinear problem further complicated by information constraints , we restrict our attention to sufficient conditions for solvability of the problem and evaluate upper bounds for synchronization error . to this end",
    "we introduce an upper bound on the limit synchronization error @xmath37 , where the supremum is taken over all admissible transmission errors . in the next two sections",
    "the coding and decoding procedures are described and a bound on admissible transmission errors @xmath38 is evaluated .",
    "in the paper @xcite the properties of observer - based synchronization for lurie systems over a limited data rate communication channel with one - step memory time - varying coder is studied .",
    "it is shown that an upper bound on the limit synchronization error is proportional to a certain upper bound on the transmission error . under the assumption that a sampling time may be properly chosen , optimality of the binary coding in the sense of demanded transmission rate is established , and the relationship between synchronization accuracy and an optimal sampling time is found .",
    "on the basis of these results , the present paper deals with a binary coding procedure .    at first",
    ", we introduce the memoryless ( static ) binary coder to be a discretized map @xmath39 as @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the _ signum _ function : @xmath42 , if @xmath43 , @xmath44 , if @xmath45 ; parameter @xmath46 may be referred to as a _",
    "coder range_. evidently , @xmath47 for all @xmath48 such that @xmath49 .",
    "notice that for a binary coder each codeword symbol contains one bit of information .",
    "the discretized output of the considered coder is given as @xmath50 and we assume that the coder and decoder make decisions based on the same information .    the static coder is a subset of the class of time - varying coders with memory , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "two underlying ideas are used for these kinds of encoder :    * reducing the coder range @xmath46 to cover the same area around the predicted value for the @xmath51th observation @xmath52 $ ] , @xmath53\\in { \\cal y}[k+1]$ ] .",
    "this means that the quantizer range @xmath46 is updated with time and a time - varying quantizer ( with different values of @xmath46 for each instant , @xmath54 $ ] ) is used . using such a `` zooming '' strategy it is possible to increase coder accuracy in the steady - state mode , and , at the same time , to prevent coder saturation at the beginning of the process ; * introducing memory into the coder , which makes it possible to predict the @xmath51th observation @xmath52 $ ] with some accuracy and , therefore , to transmit over the channel only the encrypted innovation signal .    in this paper",
    "a _ first - order coder _ is considered , where the predicted value @xmath52 $ ] is taken equal to @xmath55 $ ] @xcite . in order to describe it ,",
    "introduce the sequence of _ central numbers _",

    "@xmath58 the coder compares the current measured output @xmath55 $ ] with the number @xmath56 $ ] , forming the deviation signal @xmath59=y[k]-c[k]$ ] .",

    "the output signal @xmath60=q(\\partial y[k],m[k])\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is represented as an @xmath61-bit information symbol from the coding alphabet and transmitted over the communication channel to the decoder . then the central number @xmath62 $ ] and the range parameter @xmath63 $ ] are renewed based on the available information about the master system dynamics .",
    "assuming that the master system output @xmath48 changes at a slow rate , i.e. that @xmath52\\approx y[k]$ ] we use the following update algorithms : @xmath64=c[k]+\\bar{\\partial } y[k ] , \\quad c[0]=0,~~k=0,1,\\dots , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath65=(m_0- m_{\\infty})\\rho^k+ m_{\\infty } , ~~k=0,1,\\dots , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath66 is the decay parameter , @xmath67 stands for the limit value of @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "the initial value @xmath68 should be large enough to capture the region of possible initial values of @xmath69 .",

    "a similar algorithm is realized by the decoder .",

    ". then @xmath71 $ ] is found as a sum @xmath56 + \\bar{\\partial } y[k]$ ] .",
    "we now find a relation between the transmission rate and the achievable accuracy of the coder  decoder pair , assuming that the growth rate of @xmath6 is uniformly bounded . obviously , the exact bound @xmath72 for the rate of @xmath33 is @xmath73 , where @xmath14 is from . to analyze",

    "additionally , the error may increase from @xmath80 to @xmath81 due to change of @xmath6 by a value not exceeding @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 .",
    "therefore the total transmission error for each interval @xmath76 $ ] satisfies the inequality : @xmath86 inequality shows that in order to meet the inequality @xmath87 for all @xmath19 , the sampling interval @xmath24 should satisfy condition @xmath88    subtracting eq . from eq . and taking into account the control law we derive an equation for the synchronization error in the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 , @xmath91    evaluate the total guaranteed synchronization error @xmath92 , where @xmath93 denotes the euclidian norm of a vector , and the supremum is taken over all admissible transmission errors @xmath38 not exceeding the level @xmath94 in absolute value .",
    "the ratio @xmath95 ( the relative error ) can be interpreted as the norm of the transformation from the input function @xmath96 to the output function @xmath97 generated by the system .",
    "owing to the nonlinearity of the equation evaluation of the norm @xmath98 is nontrivial and it even may be infinite for rapidly growing nonlinearities @xmath99 . to obtain a reasonable upper bound for @xmath98",
    "we assume that the nonlinearity is lipschitz continuous along all the trajectories of the drive system .",
    "more precisely , we assume existence of a positive number @xmath100 such that @xmath101 , @xmath102 , where @xmath103 is a set containing all the trajectories of the drive system , starting from the set of initial conditions @xmath104 , @xmath105 . for lipschitz nonlinearities @xmath106",

    "a binary coder is optimal in the sense of bit - per - second rate , and the optimal sampling time @xmath24 for this coder is @xmath142 where @xmath143 .",

    "remark 1_. related estimates for synchronization errors in coupled systems were obtained in several papers @xcite . however , in @xcite either existence of lyapunov functions , i.e. stability of uncoupled systems is required , or a partial stability ( stability of the synchronization manifold ) is provided by a strong coupling playing the role of state feedback in the error system . in this paper only output feedback is allowed and coupling is applied through the control term @xmath147 , i.e. in a restrictive manner .",
    "that is why the result holds under the additional assumption ( passifiability ) caused by the nature of controlled problems .",

    "remark 2_. one can pose the following problem : evaluate upper and lower bounds for @xmath98 based on worst case inputs @xmath38 .",
    "such a problem is similar to the energy control problem for systems with dissipation @xcite and @xmath98 can be interpreted as the _ excitability index _ of the system . employing a lower bound for the excitability index for passive systems @xcite",
    "we conclude that if the gain vector @xmath36 is chosen to ensure strict passivity of the system then the lower bound for @xmath98 is positive , i.e. @xmath148    thus , for finite channel capacity the guaranteed synchronization error is not reduced to zero being of the same order of magnitude as the transmission error .",
