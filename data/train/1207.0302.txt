    "we study the external path length of a trie built over @xmath0 binary strings generated by a markov source .",
    "more precisely , we assume that the input is a sequence of @xmath0 independent and identically distributed random strings , each being composed of an infinite sequence of symbols such that the next symbol depends on the previous one and this dependence is governed by a given transition matrix ( i.e. , markov model ) .",
    "digital trees , in particular , tries have been intensively studied for the last thirty years @xcite , mostly under bernoulli ( memoryless ) model assumption .",
    "the typical depth under markovian model was analyzed in @xcite .",
    "size , external path length and height under more general _ dynamical sources _ were studied in the seminal paper of clment , flajolet , and valle @xcite , where in particular asymptotic expressions for expectations are identified as well as the asymptotic distributional behavior of the height , see also @xcite . for further analysis of tries for probabilistic models beyond bernoulli ( memoryless )",
    "sources see devroye @xcite .    with respect to markovian models , to the best of our knowledge , no asymptotic distributions for the external path length",
    "have been derived so far .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the external path length is more challenging due to stronger dependency .",
    "in fact , this is already observed for tries under bernoulli model @xcite . in this paper",
    "we establish the central limit theorem for the external path length in a trie built over a markov model using a novel use of the _ contraction method_.    let us first briefly review the contraction method .",
    "it was introduced in 1991 by uwe rsler @xcite for the distributional analysis of the complexity of the quicksort algorithm . over the last 20 years",
    "this approach , which is based on exploiting an underlying contracting map on a space of probability distributions , has been developed as a fairly universal tool for the analysis of recursive algorithms and data structures . here",
    ", randomness may come from a stochastic model for the input or from randomization within the algorithms itself ( randomized algorithms ) .",
    "general developments of this method were presented in @xcite with numerous applications in theoretical computer science .",
    "the contraction method has been used in the analysis of tries and other digital trees only under the symmetric bernoulli model ( unbiased memoryless source ) ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.3.2 ) , where limit laws for the size and the external path length of tries were re - derived .",
    "the application of the method there was heavily based on the fact that precise expansions of the expectations were available , in particular smoothness properties of periodic functions appearing in the linear terms as well as bounds on error terms which were @xmath1 for the size and @xmath2 for the path lengths .",
    "let us observe that even in the asymmetric bernoulli model such error terms seem to be out of reach for classical analytic methods ; see the discussion in flajolet , roux , and valle @xcite .",
    "hence , for the more general markov source model considered in the present paper we develop a novel use of the contraction method .",
    "furthermore , the contraction method applied to markov sources hits another snag , namely , the markov model is not preserved when decomposing the trie into its left and right subtree of the root .",
    "the initial distribution of the markov source is changed when looking at these subtrees . to overcome these problems a couple of new ideas",
    "are used for setting up the contraction method : first of all , we will use a system of distributional recursive equations , one for each subtree .",
    "we then apply the contraction method to this system of recurrences capturing the subtree processes and prove normality for the path lengths conditioned on the initial distribution . in fact , our approach avoids dealing with multivariate recurrences and instead we reduce the whole analysis to a system of one - dimensional equations .",
    "a comparison of a multivariate approach and our new version with systems of recurrences is drawn in section [ rem_multivariate ] .",
    "we also need asymptotic expansions of the mean and the variance for applying the contraction method . however , in contrast to very precise information on periodicities of linear terms for the symmetric bernoulli model mentioned above our convergence proof does only require the leading order term together with a lipschitz continuity property for the error term .",
    "in this extended abstract we develop the use of systems of recursive distributional equations in the context of the contraction method for the external path length of tries under a general markov source model .",
    "in particular , we prove the central limit theorem for the external path length , a result that had been wanting since lempel - ziv77 code was devised in 1977 .",
    "the methodology used is general enough to cover related quantities and structures as well .",
    "we are confident that our approach also applies with minor adjustments at least to the size of tries , the path lengths of digital search trees and patricia tries under the markov source model as well as other more complex data structures on words such as suffix trees .",
    "+ * notations : * throughout this paper we use the bachmann - landau symbols , in particular the big @xmath3 notation .",
    "we declare @xmath4 for @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the natural logarithm .",
    "by @xmath7 with @xmath8 and @xmath9 $ ] the binomial distribution is denoted , by @xmath10 the bernoulli distribution with success probability @xmath11 , by @xmath12 the centered normal distribution with variance @xmath13 .",
    "we use @xmath14 as a generic constant that may change from one occurrence to another .",
    "* the markov source : * we assume binary data strings over the alphabet @xmath15 generated by a homogeneous markov chain . in general , a homogeneous markov chain is given by its initial distribution @xmath16 on @xmath17 and the transition matrix @xmath18 . here , @xmath19 denotes the dirac measure in @xmath20 .",

    "a transition from state @xmath27 to @xmath28 happens with probability @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "now , a data string is generated as the sequence of states visited by the markov chain . in the markov source model",
    "assumed subsequently all data strings are independent and identically distributed according to the given markov chain .",
    "we always assume that @xmath31 for all @xmath30 .",
    "hence , the markov chain is ergodic and has a stationary distribution , denoted by @xmath32 .",
    "we have @xmath33 note however , that our markov source model does not require the markov chain to start in its stationary distribution .",
    "the case @xmath34 for all @xmath35 is essentially the symmetric bernoulli model ( only the first bit may have a different ( initial ) distribution ) .",
    "the symmetric bernoulli model has already been studied thoroughly also with respect to the external path length of tries , see @xcite .",
    "it behaves differently compared to the asymmetric bernoulli model and the other markov source models , as the variance of the external path length is linear with a periodic prefactor in the symmetric bernoulli model . in our cases we will find a larger variance of the order @xmath36 in theorem [ thm : variance ] below .",
    "we exclude the symmetric bernoulli model case subsequently . for later reference",
    ", we summarize our conditions as : @xmath37 the entropy rate of the markov chain plays an important role in the asymptotic behavior of tries .",
    "in particular , it determines leading order constants of parameters of tries that are related to depths of leaves and its external path length .",
    "the entropy rate for our markov chain is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the entropy of a transition from state @xmath27 to the next state .",
    "thus , @xmath40 is obtained as weighted average of the entropies of all possible transitions with weights according to the stationary distribution @xmath41 .",
    "+ * tries : * for a given set of data strings over the alphabet @xmath15 with each data string a unique infinite path in the infinite complete rooted binary tree is associated by identifying left branches with bit @xmath21 and right branches with bit @xmath23 .",
    "each string is stored in the unique node on its infinite path that is closest to the root and does not belong to any other data path , cf .",
    "it is the minimal prefix of a string that distinguishes this string from all others ; for details see the monographs of knuth @xcite , mahmoud @xcite or szpankowski @xcite .",
    "for the markov source model a challenge is to set the right framework under which data structures to analyze .",
    "we formulate in this section a system of distributional recurrences to capture the distribution of the external path length of tries .",
    "our subsequent analysis is entirely based on these equations .",
    "we denote by @xmath42 the external path length of a trie under the markov source model with initial distribution @xmath43 holding @xmath0 data .",
    "we have @xmath44 for all initial distributions @xmath43 .",
    "the transition matrix is given in advance and suppressed in the notation .",
    "we abbreviate @xmath45 for @xmath46 .",
    "hence , @xmath47 refers to @xmath0 independent strings all starting with bit @xmath27 and then following the markov chain .",
    "we will study @xmath48 and @xmath49 . from the asymptotic behavior of these two sequences",
    "we can then directly obtain corresponding results for @xmath42 for an arbitrary initial distribution @xmath16 as follows : we denote by @xmath50 the number of data among our @xmath0 strings which start with bit @xmath21",
    ". then @xmath50 has the binomial @xmath51 distribution .",
    "the contributions of the two subtrees of the trie to its external path length can be represented by the following stochastic recurrence @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes that left and right hand side have identical distributions and we have that @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath50 are independent .",
    "we will see later that we can directly transfer asymptotic results for @xmath48 and @xmath49 to general @xmath42 via ( [ decomp_initial ] ) , see , e.g. , the proof of theorem [ thm : limit ] .    for a recursive decomposition of @xmath48 note that we have initial distribution @xmath56 ,",
    "thus all data strings start with bit @xmath21 and are inserted into the left subtree of the root .",
    "we denote the root of this left subtree by @xmath57 . at node",
    "@xmath57 the data strings are split according to their second bit .",
    "we denote by @xmath58 the number of data strings having @xmath21 as their second bit , i.e. , the number of strings being inserted into the left subtree of @xmath57 .",
    "the markov source model implies that @xmath58 is binomial @xmath59 distributed .",
    "the right subtree of node @xmath57 then holds the remaining @xmath60 data strings .",
    "consider the left subtree of @xmath57 together with its root @xmath57 . conditioned on its number @xmath58 of data strings inserted it is generated by the same markov source model as the original trie .",
    "however , the right subtree of @xmath57 together with its root @xmath57 conditioned on its number @xmath60 of data strings is generated by a markov source model with the same transition matrix but another initial distribution , namely @xmath61 .",
    "moreover , by the independence of data strings within the markov source model , these two subtrees are independent conditionally on @xmath58 . phrased in a recursive distributional equation we have @xmath62 with @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath58 independent .",
    "a similar arguments yields a recurrence for @xmath49 .",
