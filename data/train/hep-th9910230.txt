    "nucleons the theory becomes weakly nonlocal and a chiral perturbation theory becomes of practical interest @xcite . in a dyson - schwinger setting @xcite most information about such a non local theory comes from the constraints imposed by the relevant ward and slavnov - taylor identities @xcite , perturbation theory to some finite order and hadronic phenomenology .",
    "these approaches are necessary if one wants to know , for instance , about the momentum distribution of a quark in a hadron ; neither perturbative qcd nor chiral perturbation theory can properly handle this problem . in this regard , anomalies are particulary interesting because their existence is linked to a violation of classical symmetries by high energy regulators although their physical effect is formulated as a low energy theorem . at the one loop level ,",
    "anomalies for nonlocal models have been previously discussed @xcite for some specific processes like e.g. @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we refer to those works and @xcite for further motivation . rather than computing all specific processes one by one",
    "we prove that the new terms generated by the non locality can be subtracted by adding suitable counterterms .",

    ". for convenience the @xmath30 has been put at the right . with @xmath33 the anomalous dimension of the quark condensate @xmath34 ( see ref.@xcite ) ] the better way to obtain the transformation properties of @xmath26 is by introducing a family of operators associated to @xmath26 as @xmath35 where the momentum @xmath36 is just a constant c - number .",

    "further @xmath96 the integration over @xmath49 should be performed first , since it defines the operator @xmath44 , then the integral over @xmath59 which corresponds to take the trace over space - time degrees of freedom and finally @xmath42 is to be analytically extended to @xmath41 .",
    "the simplest way to proceed is to introduce a mass term , i.e. , to apply the formula to the dirac operator @xmath97 and then make an expansion in powers of @xmath98 , letting @xmath99 at the end . in this way the following expression is derived latexmath:[\\[{{\\cal a}}_a = \\sum_{n \\ge 0 } \\int\\frac{{{d}}^dp}{(2\\pi)^d } \\int_\\gamma\\frac{{{d}}z}{2\\pi i}z^s { { \\rm tr}}\\langle 0|2i\\alpha\\gamma_5 \\frac{({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ d$}}_l+{{\\tilde{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ m$}}}}}(p))\\left(({\\mathrel{\\mathop{p\\!\\!\\!/}}}+z - m)({\\mbox{\\boldmath $ d$}}_l+{{\\tilde{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ m$}}}}}(p))\\right)^n } { ( p^2+(z - m)^2)^{n+1 } }    using the cyclic property for the trace in dirac space .",

    "the result for the four dimensional chiral anomaly is @xmath102 \\big\\rangle \\label{eq:27}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the notation @xmath103 stands for @xmath104 note that , even for non local dirac operators , the anomaly is a local polynomial of dimension @xmath105 constructed with @xmath30 and the external fields @xmath23 and @xmath32 .",
    "this is a general property of all anomalies since only ultraviolet divergent terms can contribute to them .",
    "the expressions found for the anomaly can be put in a more usual form , in terms of vector and axial fields , scalar fields , etc  , but it is preferable to use compact notation . since the regularization preserves vector gauge invariance , the axial anomaly is also invariant . in our expression for the anomaly",
    ", this is a direct consequence of the operators there being multiplicative .",
    "indeed , any operator @xmath106 constructed with the gauge covariant blocks @xmath20 and @xmath83 is also covariant , i.e. , @xmath107 . if in addition @xmath106 is multiplicative @xmath103 is invariant .",
    "note that @xmath108 is not a trace and so the cyclic property does not hold for arbitrary non multiplicative operators .",
    "the corresponding trace anomaly , within the @xmath0-function method is  @xcite @xmath109 the calculation is entirely similar to that of the axial anomaly , yielding @xmath110 where @xmath111 .",
    "the result is again a local polynomial of dimension @xmath105 in the external fields and their derivatives . unlike the axial case",
    ", the coefficients @xmath112 in four dimensions do contribute to the scale anomaly .    because scale and chiral transformations commute ( in a properly defined sense ) , the crossed variations @xmath113 and @xmath114 coincide and they vanish since the axial anomaly is scale invariant . thus the scale anomaly must be chiral invariant .",
    "the vector gauge invariance of the previous expressions is easy to check noting that the operators inside @xmath108 are multiplicative .",
    "axial invariance is much more involved in general . in four dimensions",
    "it is relatively easy to check that the trace anomaly is axially invariant in the particular case of @xmath115 , which defines a class of operators invariant under chiral and scale transformations .      presumably due to its topological connection  @xcite ,",
    "the axial anomaly is a very robust quantity .",
    "it is not affected by higher order radiative corrections  @xcite , and remains unchanged at finite temperature and density  @xcite .",
    "it gets no contributions from scalar and pseudo scalar fields  @xcite , tensor fields  @xcite or internal gauge fields , i.e , transforming homogeneously under gauge transformations  @xcite . in",
    "all known cases , the anomaly only affects the imaginary part of the effective action in euclidean space and only involves vector and axial fields .",
    "the counter terms can always be chosen so that the axial anomaly adopts the minimal or bardeen s form  @xcite .",
    "not surprisingly , the new terms introduced in the anomaly by the non local component of the dirac operator are also unessential , that is , they can be removed by adding a suitable local and polynomial counter term to the effective action . in other words ,",
    "all new terms can be derived as the axial variation of an action which is a polynomial constructed with the external fields @xmath23 and @xmath32 and their derivatives .",
    "the dimension of the polynomial can be at most @xmath105 .",
    "the general proof that the anomaly can always be brought to bardeen s form has already been presented  @xcite .",
    "the actual construction of the counter terms can be done using the method in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see some further details in ref .",
    "one interesting insight in the local case @xcite is that the needed counterterms require not only the dirac operator @xmath6 but also its adjoint @xmath116 not related to the original theory .",
    "the scale anomaly is already minimal .",
    "it can be modified by adding polynomial counter terms of dimension smaller than @xmath105 but this would add terms of the same type to the scale anomaly .",
    "the wigner transformation method combined with the @xmath0-function regularization has been further extended to the finite temperature case in @xcite . as is well known , in the imaginary time formulation of finite temperature field theory , the field configurations are periodic or antiperiodic functions of the euclidean time for bosons and fermions respectively and thus the frequency running in the fermion loop takes discrete values only , @xmath117 ( where @xmath118 stands for the temperature and @xmath119 is any integer ) which are known as matsubara frequencies . at finite temperature ,",
    "the trace of an operator @xmath120 , acting on the hilbert space of @xmath121-dimensional fermions with possible internal degrees of freedom , becomes @xmath122 this formula generalizes that for zero temperature .",
    "note that @xmath106 is a periodic function of @xmath123 , and @xmath68 is the state with zero momentum and energy normalized to @xmath124 , and thus it is periodic too .    in ref .",
    "@xcite this method has been applied to compute the anomalous component of the effective action of two- and four - dimensional fermions at finite temperature in the presence of arbitrary vector and axial gauge fields and scalar and pseudoscalar fields on the chiral circle .",
    "the computation is carried out to leading order in a suitable commutator which preserves chiral symmetry . as is well known , at zero temperature the gauge wess - zumino - witten ( wzw ) action , which saturates the chiral anomaly ,",
    "is the only leading contribution in the anomalous sector ; further terms must be lorentz and chiral invariant and they vanish identically unless they have more gradients thereby being sub - leading terms . at finite temperature",
    "the situation is different since lorentz invariance is partially broken and this allows to have new chiral invariant contributions of the same order as the wzw action . in particular these terms",
    "modify the @xmath125 amplitude which is no longer determined by the chiral anomaly  @xcite . the calculation in @xcite confirms previous results @xcite that this amplitude vanishes in a chiral symmetric phase ( see also @xcite ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the same technique is applied to the study of @xmath126-dimensional fermions at finite temperature in the presence of arbitrary background gauge fields .",
    "the use of the @xmath0-function regularization guarantees the gauge invariance of the result under topologically small and large transformations .",
    "this has allowed to solve a long standing puzzle , namely , the apparent renormalization of the chern - simons coefficient at finite temperature , which has been shown to be a perturbation theory artifact  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite all ultraviolet divergent terms of the effective action , within a strict gradient expansion , have been computed .",
    "the result preserves gauge and parity symmetries ( up to the standard temperature independent parity anomaly ) and display the correct @xmath127 multivaluation introduced by the chern - simons term . the known exact result for massless fermions  @xcite",
    "is also reproduced .",
