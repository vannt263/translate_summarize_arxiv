    "the use of discrete models in physics has become very popular , mainly for two reasons .",
    "it helps to find the solutions of some differential equations by numerical methods , which would not be possible to solve by analytic methods . besides that",
    ", the introduction of a lattice is equivalent to the introduction of a cut - off in the momentum variable for the field in order to achieve the finite limit of the solution . in the case of relativistic field equations -like the dirac , klein - gordon , and the electromagnetic interactions- we have worked out some particular cases [ 1 ] .",
    "there is an other motivation for the discrete models and it is based in some philosophical presuppositions that the space - time structure is discrete .",
    "this is more attractive in the case of general relativity and quantum gravity because it makes more transparent the connection between the discrete properties of the intrinsic curvature and the background independent gravitational field .",
    "this last approach was started rigorously by regge in the early sixties [ 2 ] .",
    "he introduces some triangulation in a riemannian manifold , out of which he constructs local curvature , coordinate independent , on the polyhedra . with the help of the total curvature on the vertices of the discrete manifold he constructs a finite action which , in the continuous limit , becomes the standard hilbert - einstein action of general relativity .",
    "regge himself applied his method ( `` regge calculus '' ) to quantum gravity in three dimensions [ 3 ] . in this work he assigns some representation of the @xmath1 group to the edges of the triangles . to be more precise , to every tetrahedron appearing in the discrete triangulation of the manifold he associates a 6j - symbol in such a way that the spin eigenvalues of the corresponding representation satisfy sum rules described by the edges and vertices of the tetrahedra .",
    "since the value of the 6j - symbol has a continuous limit when some edges of the tetrahedra become very large , he could calculate the sum of this limit for all the 6j - symbols attached to the tetrahedra , and in this way he could compare it with the continuous hilbert - einstein action corresponding to an euclidean non planar manifold .",
    "a different approach to the discretization of space and time was taken by penrose [ 4 ] .",
    "given some graph representing the interaction of elementary units satisfying the rules of angular momentum without an underlying space , he constructs out of this network ( `` spin network '' ) the properties of total angular momentum as a derived concept .",
    "later this model was applied to quantum gravity in the sense of ponzano and regge .",
    "in general , a spin network is a triple @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a graph with a finite set of edges @xmath4 , a finite set of vertices @xmath5 , @xmath6 is the representation of a group g attached to an edge , and @xmath7 is an intertwiner attached to each vertex . if we take the product of the amplitudes corresponding to all the edges and vertices ( given in terms of the representations and intertwiners ) we obtain the particular diagram of some quantum state .",
    "although the physical consequences of penrose s ideas were soon considered to be equivalent to the ponzano - regge approach to quantum gravity [ 5 ] , the last method was taken as guiding rule in the calculation of partition functions .",
    "we can mention a few results .",
    "turaev and viro [ 6 ] calculated the state sum for a 3d - triangulated manifold with tetrahedra described by 6j - symbols using the @xmath8 group .",
    "this model was enlarged to 4-dimensional triangulations and was proved by turaev , oguri , crane and yetter [ 7 ] to be independent of the triangulation ( the `` tocy model '' ) .",
    "a different approach was introduced by boulatov [ 8 ] that led to the same partition function as the tocy model , but with the advantage that the terms corresponding to the kinematics and the interaction could be distinguished . for this purpose",
    "he introduced some fields defined over the elements of the groups @xmath9 , invariant under the action of the group , and attached to the edges of the tetrahedra .",
    "the kinematical term corresponds to the self interacting field over each edge and the interaction term corresponds to the fields defined in different edges and coupled among themselves .",
    "this method ( the boulatov matrix model ) was very soon enlarged to 4-dimensional triangulations by ooguri [ 9 ] . in both models the fields over the matrix elements of the group are expanded in terms of the representations of the group and then integrated out , with the result of a partition function extended to the amplitudes over all tetrahedra , all edges and vertices of the triangulation .",
    "a more abstract approach was taken by barrett and crane , generalizing penrose s spin networks to 4 dimensions .",
    "the novelty of this model consists in the association of representation of the @xmath0 group to the faces of the tetrahedra . we will come back to this model in section 5 .    because we are interested in the physical and mathematical properties of the barrett - crane model , we mention briefly some recent work about this model combined with the matrix model approach of boulatov and ooguri [ 10 ] . in this work",
    "the 2d quantum space - time emerges as a feynman graph , in the manner of the 4d matrix models . in this way a spin foam model is connected to the feynman diagram of quantum gravity .    in this paper",
    "we have tried to implement all the mathematical consequences of barrett - crane model using the group theoretical properties of @xmath0 applied to the 4d - triangulation of manifolds in terms of 4-simplices .",
    "it turns out that when we take into account the description of spin representations of @xmath0 the weight function given by barrett and williams is incomplete ; besides the values for the areas in the regge action can be calculated in our paper directly from geometrical considerations .",
    "the rotation group in 4 dimensions is the group of linear transformations that leaves the quadratic form @xmath12 invariant .",
    "the well known fact that this group is locally isomorphic to @xmath13 enables one to decompose the group action in the following way :    take a complex matrix ( not necessarily unimodular ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 satisfies @xmath16 .",
    "we define the _ complete _ group action @xmath17 where @xmath18 correspond to the left , right action , respectively , @xmath19 the complete group action satisfies : @xmath20 or @xmath21 , which corresponds to the defining relation for @xmath22 .    in order to make connection with @xmath23 , we take only the _ left _ action @xmath24 and express the matrix elements of @xmath15 as a 4-vector @xmath25    substituting @xmath26 , and @xmath27 , we get @xmath28    obviously , the transformation matrix is orthogonal .",
    "similarly for the right action @xmath29 we get @xmath30 and after substituting @xmath31 , we get @xmath32 where the transformation matrix is orthogonal .    if we take the complete action @xmath33 we get @xmath34 and taking @xmath35 we get the general transformation matrix for the 4-dimensional vector in @xmath23 under the group @xmath22 as @xmath36    notice that the eight parameters @xmath37 with the constraints @xmath38 , can be considered the cayley parameters for the @xmath0 group [ 11 ] .",
    "given the fundamental 4-dimensional representation of @xmath22 in terms of the parameters @xmath39 , as given in ( 9 ) , @xmath40 the tensor representations are defined in the usual way @xmath41    for the sake of simplicity we take the second rank tensors .",
    "we can decompose them into totally symmetric and antisymmetric tensors , namely , @xmath42 if we substract the trace from @xmath43 we get a tensor that transforms under an irreducible representation . for the antisymmetrie tensor",
    "the situation is more delicate .",
    "in general we have @xmath44    this representation of dimension 6 is still reducible . for simplicity",
    "take the left action of the group given in ( 5 ) .",
    "the linear combination of the antisymmetric tensor components are transformed among themselves in the following way : @xmath45 @xmath46 in the case of the right action given by ( 7 ) the 6-dimensional representation for the antisymmetrie second rank tensor decomposes into two irreducible 3-dimensional representation of @xmath22 .",
    "for this purpose one takes the linear combination of the components of the antisymmetric tensor as before : @xmath47 @xmath48 therefore the 6-dimensional representation for the antisymmetric tensor decomposes into two irreducible 3-dimensional irreducible representation of the @xmath22 group .    for the spinor representation of @xmath49",
    "we take @xmath50    let @xmath51 be a set of complex numbers of dimension @xmath52 which transform under the @xmath49 group as follows : @xmath53 where @xmath54 are the components of @xmath55 .",
    "if @xmath56 is totally symmetric in the indices @xmath57 the representation of dimension @xmath58 is irreducible . in an analogous way we can define an irreducible representation of @xmath59 with respect to the totally symmetric multispinor of dimension @xmath60 .    for the general group @xmath61 we can take a set of totaly symmetrie multispinors that transform under the @xmath0 group as @xmath62 where @xmath63 are the components of a general element of @xmath49 and @xmath64 are the components of a general element of @xmath59 .",

    "in fact , the spin dependent factor appearing in the exponential of ( 37 ) @xmath200 corresponding to two tetrahedra @xmath201 intersecting the triangle @xmath202 , can be interpreted as the product of the angle between the two vectors @xmath187 perpendicular to the triangle and the area @xmath203 of the intersecting triangle .",
