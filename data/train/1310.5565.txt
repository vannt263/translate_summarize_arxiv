    "the emergence of new interesting physics by the application of electrical and magnetical fields on graphene is one of the properties of this material .",
    "it was shown for example recently that new dirac points can be opened in the energy spectrum by imposing an electrical sl on the graphene layer @xcite .",
    "most important in neutral graphene is that these new dirac points are opened up in the lowest energy band .",
    "other dirac points emerge as linking points of two minibands @xcite at higher energies .",
    "new dirac points were in fact found experimentally for graphene with moir sls on underlying substrates @xcite and in unidirectional corrugated graphene monolayers @xcite .",
    "such points lead to unusual conductivity properties in sl systems @xcite .",
    "together with the new dirac points also vhss emerge in the density of states shown up as saddle points in the energy spectrum .",
    "the new dirac points are linked by the saddle points .    since the discovery of graphene there were attempts to find superconductivity in these materials .",
    "this is mainly motivated by the fact that superconductivity shows up experimentally in other carbon based materials with rather high critical temperatures @xmath0 for conventional superconductors as for example graphite intercalated ( @xmath3 ) @xcite and fullerite compounds ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "both forms of carbon based superconductors are mainly well described by the conventional phonon mediated bcs theory .",
    "the higher temperatures in the fullerite superconductors can be attributed to the high frequency of the innermolecular phonon modes being responsible for pairing in fullerites @xcite .",
    "these phonon modes have around one order of magnitude higher frequencies than phonons mediating bcs superconductivity in metals @xcite .",
    "similar high phonon frequencies are also found in the graphene phonon spectrum .",
    "furthermore , theoretically it was shown that also graphane @xcite , multilayer @xcite and strained graphene @xcite could lead to bcs instabilities with high temperatures . in refs .",
    "it was shown theoretically that for pristine graphene at half filling a critical interaction value exists above which bcs pairing is possible .",
    "this is mainly due to a vanishing density of states at half filling . in both papers restrictions on the electronic pairing",
    "are made where either a coupling with total zero momentum @xcite is considered or , more restrictively with an onsite s - wave pairing of one electron close to the @xmath1 with another electron close to the @xmath5 valley @xcite . for small but non - zero chemical potentials gained by electrostatic doping , @xmath0 is still small .",
    "except of the small density of states at these fillings one has to take also into account here the smallness of the optical electron - phonon coupling constant which is relevant in this regime @xcite .",
    "the corresponding deformation potential for the coupling of electrons with longitudinal acoustic @xmath6 phonons is much higher than of the other acoustic and optical phonon modes @xcite .",
    "this coupling mechanism should become relevant for larger chemical potentials when the corresponding bloch grneisen temperature @xmath7 in which @xmath8 is the fermi - momentum and @xmath9 the phonon velocity , is in the regime of the debye temperature @xcite . here",
    "we use the fact that @xmath0 scales exponentially with the inverse square of the electron - phonon coupling , but only factorially with the energy cut - off @xmath10 for acoustic phonon coupling , or the main optical phonon frequency for optical phonon pairing . note that in graphene the debye frequency of the longitudinal acoustic @xmath6 phonons is of similar magnitude as of the main optical phonons . with the application of a sl ,",
    "the electron bands are effectively folded bringing the effective grneisen temperature also for low electrostatic doping potentials in the regime where the deformation potential coupling becomes relevant .",
    "this is one motivation to consider superconductivity in graphene superimposed by an sl .",
    "an additional motivation is the existence of low - lying vhss in sl graphene which promises superconductivity with high @xmath0-values for chemical potentials close to the vhss .",
    "there are other possible sources of superconductivity than only phonon mediated superconductivity .",
    "one finds in the literature for example the coulomb interaction as a possible source of pairing via the kohn - luttinger mechanism in graphene @xcite .",
    "this effect becomes most pronounced for energy bands when a vhs is existent .",
    "in pristine graphene one finds three in - equivalent saddle points producing a vhs at large energies linking the @xmath1 and @xmath11 dirac points . such high chemical potentials can yet only be reached by chemical doping @xcite .",
    "it was shown in ref .   that a possible @xmath12 wave instability with high @xmath0 can only be guaranteed when the saddle points producing the vhs are linked approximatively by nesting vectors .",
    "such nesting vectors are not found for the vhss in sl systems .",
    "note that phonon - coupled bcs theory is not yet discussed for high chemical doped graphene in the literature .",
    "one reason is that phonon modes are sensitive on the special chemical doping which makes it rather complicated to carry out such calculations @xcite .    in the following",
    ", we will discuss the simplest case of bcs - type superconductivity in sl superimposed graphene mediated by acoustic phonons .",
    "we concentrate us hereby to the most interesting region of chemical potentials close to vhss since this promises the highest @xmath0-values .",
    "since we shall use analytically the role of the different possible superconducting order parameters in the sl system , our investigation can in principle be used when other superconducting coupling mechanisms become relevant .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sect .",
    "ii we give first an introduction to the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation for superconductivity in graphene superimposed with an sl and discuss the transfer matrix formalism for solving this equation .",
    "iii discusses the one - particle spectrum , and sect .",
    "iv the phase diagram as a function of temperature .",
    "in the following we neglect corrections to bcs superconductivity expressions due to the repelling coulomb interaction . here we take into account that the unscreened interaction potential of electrons due to coulomb interaction is of similar value as the attractive interaction potential from the frhlich hamiltonian ( c.f .",
    "( [ 15 ] ) ) for momentum transfer @xmath13 calculated by using longitudinal acoustic electron - phonon coupling , where @xmath14 is the debye momentum and @xmath15   the interlattice distance . due to the large momentum transfer",
    ", we can neglected in our calculation screening effects due to a possible substrate and further the inner graphene screening . for electron band widths much larger than the energy cut - off due to the electron - phonon interaction ,",
    "retardation effects becomes important and an electron scatters with the phonon trace of another electron being not close in space at the same time @xcite .",
    "this leads to a suppression of the effective couloumb interaction potential known as the so called coulomb pseudopotential .",
    "this potential is strongly suppressed for superconductors where the density of states is large at the fermi - surface @xcite .",
    "this is the case in the regime we are interested in when the chemical potential of the sl system lies close to a vhs . for small momentum transfer",
    "we can neglect the coulomb interaction due to the large screening in the vicinity of the vhss .",
    "we discuss here the most simple representation of a sl being a symmetric two - step kronig - penney potential with a superlattice potential @xmath16 where @xmath17   $ ] .",
    "the function @xmath18 $ ] is the sign of @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the wavelength of the sl . in the continuum approximation ,",
    "the graphene hamiltonian under consideration near the @xmath21 dirac point is given for @xmath22 by @xcite @xmath23 here @xmath24 are the pauli matrices , while @xmath25 is the velocity of the electrons in graphene . in the following ,",
    "we assume as in conventional superconductors spin singlet pairing , being most reasonable for phonon pairing .",
    "the formalism is then simplified considerably by taking into account the eigenvalue problem in the nambu space with the eight component field @xmath26 .",
    "the bdg - hamiltonian is given by @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the two - dimensional unit matrix .",

    "@xmath36 is the energy of the lowest band of ( [ 10 ] ) for @xmath37 ( c.f .",
    "( [ 80 ] ) below ) .",
    "we point out that @xmath34 and @xmath38 are canonical momenta and not the bloch momenta of the eigenfunctions . a sufficient condition that the bdg equation ( [ 10 ] ) is then a mean - field bcs decoupling equation for the exact superconducting problem by using the frhlich interaction approximation requires that the eigenfunctions of ( [ 10 ] ) for @xmath39 are localized on a circle in canonical momentum space for electrons with energies close to the chemical potential .",
    "that ( [ 10 ] ) together with @xmath29 in the canonical momentum basis is well defined requires further that the energy band @xmath36 is a unique function of the canonical momenta .",
    "both assumptions will be shown below where we also determine the energy cut - off @xmath40 .",
    "let @xmath41 denote the phonon induced coupling constant of the frhlich hamiltonian for graphene .",
    "due to the inhomogeneity of the sl in space it is not appropriate to consider a constant pairing function .",
    "instead we shall assume an order parameter which is step - like of the form @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are constant .",
    "the acoustic electron - phonon energy due to deformation potential coupling is given by @xmath45 is the strain tensor of the graphene lattice . the effective frhlich interaction coupling constant @xmath41 is then given by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the longitudinal acoustic phonon velocity , and @xmath48 the density of carbon atoms .",
    "this leads to @xmath49 .",

    "the corresponding frhlich coupling constant for out - of - plane acoustic phonons is by a factor @xmath51 smaller , where @xmath52 is the bending constant @xcite and @xmath53 is the debye frequency for longitudinal acoustic phonons .",
    "the frhlich interaction hamiltonian is then @xmath54    we obtain from ( [ 5 ] ) and ( [ 15 ] ) by using a mean - field decoupling the bdg hamiltonian ( [ 10 ] ) where the bdg - matrix has then in general ten unknown complex parameters @xmath55 .",
    "here we assume that @xmath56 for @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 when we take into account spin singlet pairing in the original graphene fields .",
    "one can simplify this matrix further under the assumption that the condensate does not break the time - inversion symmetry as well as the mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath60 and @xmath61-axis , where we choose that the mirror operation with respect to the @xmath60-axis should lead to an interchanging of @xmath62 , @xmath63 atoms if @xmath64 and @xmath63 denotes the inequivalent carbon atoms in the fundamental cell .",
    "these assumptions will be justified further below .",

    "similar is also assumed for the @xmath60-axis mirror transformation @xmath69 and the @xmath70-axis mirror transformation @xmath71 . by taking into account the invariance of the condensate under these operations ,",

    "a is that it can be simply adapted to other coupling mechanisms .",
    "it is well known that in two dimensions the phase fluctuations of a continuous order parameter are so strong that a finite order parameter value calculated in mean - field vanishes in higher order approximations ( hohenberg - mermin - wagner - theorem ) .",

    "- zero a kosterlitz - thouless transition emerges which is connected to an unbinding of vortex - antivortex excitations when crossing the temperature from below @xcite .",

    "we can find in two - dimensional systems superconductivity .",
    "in other words , the mean - field bcs theory which we formulated in this paper , approximatively can only describe the transition temperature where the pairing amplitude is unequal to zero being then an upper bound for the true superconducting phase transition temperature .",
    "this temperature difference where the order parameter amplitude becomes unequal to zero and where the vortex unbinding happens is not large at least in the regime where @xmath345 was shown quantitatively in the case of two - dimensional metals in refs .   by using eliashberg theory . due to this",
    ", we also expect in the case of the graphene system that the two temperatures are quite close to each other .",
    "we have examined possible bcs instabilities mediated by acoustic @xmath6 phonons in electrical superlattice systems . here",
    "we restrict ourselves to sl potentials @xmath234 , @xmath346 where @xmath347 is not too small such that the acoustic phonon coupling is in fact the dominating phonon coupling process . in the regime @xmath234 ,",
    "the energy bands are folded where new dirac points linked by low - lying energy vhss emerge .",
    "we considered in this paper mainly pairing for chemical potentials close to vhss where the highest @xmath0 temperatures are attained . for sl systems",
    "such chemical potentials should be reached by electrostatic doping .",
    "we showed under the assumption of a pairing that fulfills time inversion symmetry together with the symmetry of the sl and graphene lattice that electronic onsite s - wave pairing of an electron around the @xmath1 point with another electron around the @xmath2 point is most relevant .",
    "the relevant order parameter is almost constant in space .",
    "we obtain large transition temperatures @xmath0 especially where vhss lie close to each other .",
    "we have compared the calculated @xmath0 values of the sl system with phonon mediated transition temperatures of electrostatic doped pristine graphene . finally , we argued that the encountered order parameter ( up to chiral symmetry ) is also the leading electronic pairing mechanism when taken into account no symmetry restrictions on the condensate matrix .",

    "in the main text we considered only highly symmetric condensates as possible electron pairings which fulfill the full mirror symmetry of the sl and additional time inversion symmetry and spin singlet pairing .",
    "this led to the condensates ( [ 20 ] ) as the only contributions to the matrix @xmath84 .",
    "as was mentioned in the main text , we have in general no restriction for acoustic phonon coupling on the condensate matrix @xmath84 .",

    "the regime @xmath351 $ ] of the spectrum is most relevant for superconducting pairing .",
    "let us recall from the main text in sect .",
    "iii that in the case of the highly symmetric condensates , the dominance of the @xmath324-condensate contributions over the @xmath231- and @xmath240-contributions came mainly from the fact that in the gapfunction @xmath352 ( [ 200 ] ) the prefactor @xmath353 for @xmath275 is much larger than the prefactor @xmath354 for @xmath276 .",
    "furthermore we found the dominance of the @xmath199 condensates over the @xmath240 condensates due to an additional prefactor @xmath270 in the @xmath240 condensate term ( [ 205 ] ) .",

    "other condensates of the matrix form @xmath357 and @xmath358 lead to energy gap contributions being a factor @xmath359 smaller where condensates of the form @xmath360 are a factor @xmath270 smaller .    by using the chiral invariance of ( [ 10 ] ) in the electron and hole sector",
    "independently we can restrict ourselves by using the singular value decomposition of the matrix @xmath361 to matrices @xmath362 . here",
    "@xmath363 and @xmath364 are real condensates being constant over the sl .",
    "the dominant mass gap contributions @xmath365 are then given by @xmath366 here @xmath367 , @xmath368 are the two orthogonal eigenvectors of the matrix @xmath369 for @xmath370 in the electronic sector where now also contributions from smaller subleading condensate contributions can have a strong influence via @xmath256 on the free energy .",
    "for deriving ( [ a10 ] ) we took into account the discussion following ( [ 140 ] ) .",
    "note that the spectrum ( [ a10 ] ) with ( [ 190 ] ) for @xmath371 and @xmath372 , respectively , is now in general no longer degenerate as in ( [ 170])-([200 ] ) but has two nondegenerate bands with two different gap values .",
    "we now minimize the dominant part of the free energy first with respect to @xmath373 .",
