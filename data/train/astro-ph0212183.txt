    "variable stars in stellar systems such as gcs and dwarf galaxies have played a fundamental role in improving our knowledge on stellar populations ( baade 1958 ) as well as on the physical mechanism that drive the pulsation instability ( schwarzschild 1942 ) .",
    "the main advantage of cluster variables when compared with field ones is that they are located at the same distance , and possibly the same reddening .",
    "moreover , they formed from the same proto - globular cloud and therefore they have the same age , and chemical composition .",
    "even though cluster variables present several undoubted advantages current knowledge concerning the pulsation properties of these objects is still limited .",
    "recent estimates based on new data reduction procedures to perform differential photometry ( isis , alard 2000 ) suggest that the incompleteness factor in the detection of rr lyrae stars is at least of the order of 30% ( kaluzny et al .",
    "2001 ; corwin & carney 2001 ) in galactic gcs characterized by high central densities .",
    "this limit is even more severe for obss , since the luminosity amplitude range from hundredths of a magnitude to a few tenths .",
    "moreover , their radial distribution peaks toward the center of the cluster , and therefore ground based observations are strongly limited by crowding ( gilliland et al .",
    "1998 ; santolamazza et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the same outcome applies to miras and to semi - regular variables in ggcs , but for a different reason , quite often they are saturated in current ccd chips .",
    "this is a real limit for metal - rich clusters of the galactic bulge , since they lack of rr lyrae stars or host a few of them ( pritzl et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the detection of miras could supply an independent distance estimate ( feast et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "variable stars in dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) galaxies presents several pros and cons when compared with variables in ggcs .",
    "the star formation history as well as the dynamical evolution of dsph galaxies is much more complex than for ggcs .",
    "typically the age of stellar populations in lg dsphs ranges from a few gyr to 12 - 13 gyr , i.e. as old as stars in ggcs ( da costa 1999 ) .",
    "wide photometric surveys strongly support the evidence of extra - tidal stars near several dsphs ( irwin & hatzidimitriou 1995 ; martinez - delgado et al .",
    "the observation of these stellar debris resembles the tidal tails detected in several ggcs ( leon et al . 2000 ) . on the other hand",
    ", dsph galaxies apparently host large amounts of dark matter ( dm ) , and indeed the mass - to - light ratios in these systems range from @xmath0 ( fornax ) to @xmath1 ( ursa minor ) .",
    "however , the scenario is still quite controversial and the evidence that dsphs present large dm central densities would suggest that they are not a large version of ggcs , since the latter present m / l ratios @xmath2 .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic data on variable stars in dsphs might supply new insights on the impact that environmental effects have on their evolutionary and pulsation properties .",
    "unfortunately , data available in the literature are limited , since these stellar systems cover wide sky regions . the use of wide field imagers and wide field",
    ", multifiber spectrographs might overcome these problems .    in the following we discuss the impact that variables in stellar systems might have on cosmic distances and on stellar populations .",
    "rr lyrae stars together with subdwarf main sequence fitting are the most popular standard candles to estimate the distance to ggcs ( carretta et al .",
    "2000 ; bono et al .",
    "2001 ) . both of them require accurate evaluations of cluster metal abundance , but the latter ones are more sensitive to reddening corrections ( castellani 1999 ) .",
    "rr lyrae stars present the non trivial advantage that individual reddening can be estimated on the basis of mean colors . during the last few years",
    "have been suggested new methods that rely on observables that do not depend at all on color excess , namely the pulsation period and the luminosity amplitude ( kovacs & walker 2001 ; piersimoni et al .",
    "even though these pulsation parameters can be easily estimated , the accuracy of individual reddenings might be affected by systematic uncertainties .",
    "empirical evidence suggest that approximately the 30% of fundamental pulsators are affected by the blazhko phenomenon ( kolenberg , this meeting ) , i.e. the light curve shows both amplitude and possibly phase modulation ( kurtz et al .",
    "the previous number fraction is supported by recent multiband investigation of rr lyrae in ngc  3201 ( piersimoni et al .",
    "2002 ) and in m3 ( corwin & carney 2001 ) .",
    "= 10.0 cm    fig .",
    "1 shows the suspected blazhko rr lyrae detected in ngc  3201 .",
    "note that secondary blazhko periods are only available for a few ggcs such as m3 .",
    "although , this pulsation feature was detected long time ago ( blazhko 1907 ) we still lack a firm knowledge of the physical mechanisms that drive the occurrence of such a phenomenon .",
    "moreover , empirical data for cluster variables are poor , since they typically cover short - time intervals .",
    "this limits the use of the bailey diagram ( amplitude vs period ) not only to estimate the intrinsic parameters of rr lyrae ( bono et al .",
    "1997 ) but also to estimate their individual color excesses .",
    "this limit affects not only the detection of semiregular ( sr ) and long - period - variables ( lpvs ) but also variables along the rgb and long - period binary systems .",
    "on the other hand , the poor spatial resolution of ground based measurements and the limited accuracy hampered the detection of low - amplitude variables such as sx phoenicis stars and by draconis in the innermost regions of gcs .",
    "the unprecedented amount of homogeneous and accurate time series data collected by gilliland and collaborators to detect planets around g type stars in 47  tuc demonstrated that current knowledge concerning cluster variables is still limited .",
    "in particular , they found a wealth of binary systems , as well as a new class of variable stars located at the base of the sub giant branch that they called `` red stragglers '' ( see table 1 ) .",

    "the results presented in the previous sections bring forward the evidence that the empirical scenario for variable stars in stellar systems such as gcs and lg dwarf galaxies is far from being complete .",
    "the limit applies not only to aperiodic variables but also to long - period variables such as miras and semi - regulars .",
    "the same outcome applies to rr lyrae stars affected by the blazhko effect .    even though several lg dsphs present stellar populations with chemical compositions and stellar ages quite similar to stars in gcs , the rr lyrae variables present pulsation properties that are a _ bridge _ between oosterhoff type i and oosterhoff type ii clusters .",
    "this preliminary evidence seems to suggest that either the dynamical history and/or the chemical evolution in these stellar systems might play a role to explain this difference . in this context",
    "the use of the new wide field imagers will supply the unique opportunity to investigate on a star - by - star basis the stars and the variables in lg dwarf galaxies .",
    "although new theoretical frameworks have been developed to account for the occurrence of mixed - mode pulsators among rr lyrae and obss we still lack a comprehensive explanation of the physical mechanisms that drive the occurrence of such a phenomena .",
    "it goes without saying that new sets of full amplitude nonlinear , convective models tightly connected with evolutionary models are highly requested to constrain the region of the instability strip where these pulsators present this intriguing behavior .",
