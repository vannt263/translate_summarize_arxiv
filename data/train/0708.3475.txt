    "the phenomenon of high - temperature superconductivity in strongly correlated materials such as the cuprates , still represents one of the most challenging topic in condensed matter physics twenty years after the discovery .",
    "a reason for the difficulty in dealing with the cuprates is certainly the richness and complexity of their phenomenology , which gives rise to many competitive explanations , making it extremely hard to identify the relevant physical processes underlying the outstanding properties of these compounds . in this light",
    ", very important information would be inferred extracting from the whole body of experimental observations , the data measuring general and fundamental properties ( e.g. , thermodynamic quantities and sum rules ) , focusing as much as possible on ubiquitous ( material independent ) aspects .    one important example , in the context of the infrared spectroscopy experiments , is represented by the analysis of the optical sumrule ( sr)@xcite .",
    "a big effort has been devoted in the last few years to the evaluation of the frequency integrals of the optical conductivity @xmath0 in several cuprates ( e.g. , @xmath1 ( bscco)@xcite , @xmath2 ( lsco)@xcite , @xmath3 ( ybco)@xcite , and more recently also @xmath4-based cuprates@xcite ) , and to the study of their behavior as a function of temperature and doping .",
    "one of the most general results emerging from these studies is the strong temperature dependence of the optical spectral weight ( or partial optical sum rule ) defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an upper cut - off , whose role will be discussed in the following .",
    "more in detail , leaving aside the behavior of the superconducting phase which establishes below the critical temperature @xmath7 , where even the sign of the temperature variation of @xmath8 depends on doping@xcite , the main results of the infrared estimate of the partial sr in the normal phase ( @xmath9 ) of the cuprates are essentially two : ( i ) a strong enhancement of the @xmath10 is observed when @xmath11 is reduced .",
    "such enhancement is generally quadratic in temperature and is not strongly doping dependent ; ( ii ) the extrapolated spectral weight at @xmath12 , @xmath13 displays , instead , a clear doping dependence , increasing monotonically with @xmath14 .",
    "the qualitative results do not depend significantly on the value of the cut - off @xmath6 and they hold in particular when it reaches the plasma frequency ( around 1 ev ) .    in this work we present a detailed analysis of the behavior of the optical sumrule based on dynamical mean - field theory , a non perturbative many - body approach which allows for an accurate treatment of strong correlation effects , which turn out to be crucial to account for the experimental observations .",
    "we base our analysis on the previous work of ref . , which we extend by including realistic two - dimensional bandstructures with van hove singularities .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we discuss previous results on non interacting models , and on the qualitative effect of correlations .",
    "iii contains a brief introduction to dmft and our solution .",
    "iv is devoted to the discussion of our dmft results , while a simple interpretation of the same results is presented in sec . v. sec .",
    "vi is dedicated to concluding remarks .",
    "most of the interest in the optical sr comes from its relation with the kinetic energy@xcite .",
    "the most straightforward identification is actually limited to tight - binding ( tb ) models with nearest - neighbor hopping , where , both in the presence and in the absence of electron - electron interactions we have @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lattice constant , @xmath17 the cell volume , and @xmath18 the kinetic energy of the carriers .",
    "the relation holds if the cutoff @xmath6 is chosen large enough to contain the whole optical spectrum . for a non interacting system",
    "this would correspond to integrate up to the `` plasma frequency '' of the model .",
    "we will see briefly that this identification can be significantly modified by the inclusion of next - nearest ( and further ) neighbor hopping .",
    "( [ eq : tb ] ) , connecting the sr to the kinetic energy , leads to a potential trivial explanation of point ( i ) .",
    "the @xmath19 behavior can indeed be recovered through a simple sommerfeld expansion of ( [ eq : tb ] ) , which gives indeed @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 ( for a flat dos of bandwidth @xmath23 , e.g. , @xmath24 , see ref . ) .    on the other hand , as pointed out in refs .",
    ", this one - parameter model can not account simultaneously for the experimentally measured values of @xmath25 and of @xmath26 .",
    "in particular , realistic hopping parameters are not compatible with the size of the observed temperature variation of @xmath8 .",
    "the experimental value of @xmath26 could be recovered only invoking a value of @xmath27 mev smaller _ by more than one order of magnitude _ than the values determined either theoretically by means of bandstructure calculations@xcite , or experimentally through photoemission measurements@xcite .",
    "the simple nearest - neighbor non interacting model appears even poorer when considering the behavior of the zero temperature sumrule ( ii ) .",
    "first , the above mentioned value @xmath28 mev is totally incompatible with the experimental values of @xmath13 ( which ranges from @xmath29 mev ) .",
    "second , the simple model predicts @xmath13 decreasing with the doping level , just opposite to the observations .    a first natural step to heal the inadequacy of",
    "the above nearest - neighbor model is to include a more realistic bandstructure . in particular as we already mentioned , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tb ] ) is valid only for pure nearest - neighbor hopping . when releasing this restriction , the generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tb ] ) reads @xmath30 where the sum is performed over all the @xmath31 momenta @xmath32 of the first brillouin zone , @xmath33 is the dispersion and @xmath34 the occupation number for a given @xmath32 state .    it has been pointed out in ref . that in the non - interacting case the inclusion of the next - nearest neighbor hopping term @xmath35 can determine remarkable changes in the above picture .",
    "more specifically , for realistic values of the hopping parameters , remarkable differences between the kinetic energy and the optical spectral weight behavior ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tb2 ] ) ) appear , mainly for dopings close to the two - dimensional van hove singularity ( vhs ) : while the temperature dependence of @xmath18 is only weakly affected by the doping level , @xmath36 is more sensitive to the vhs , whose proximity determines a stronger temperature dependence .",
    "although a stronger @xmath11-dependence of the spectral weight goes certainly in the direction of the experimental evidence , many inconsistencies remain : first of all the enhancement of the @xmath11-dependence of @xmath36 is still not enough to account for the experiments ; secondly for some ( and realistic ) values of the hopping parameters the results can even show a change of sign in the temperature variation of @xmath36 , which has never been observed experimentally .",
    "finally -as already noted in ref .",
    "- the doping dependence of @xmath37 remains opposite to the experimental data .",
    "the failure of these simple noninteracting models to capture the experimental behavior can not be surprising in light of the unquestioned role of electronic correlations in the cuprates . in ref .",
    "we have shown that the inclusion of correlations determines indeed a huge step ahead in the understanding of experimental data .",
    "a strong suggestion to proceed in this direction comes also from point ( ii ) ( see introduction ) , because the monotonically increasing values of @xmath13 would find a very natural explanation in a strongly correlated scenario , where the electronic mobility is minimal at half - filling and it increases with doping . in ref .",
    "it is demonstrated how the presence of strong interactions can actually determine a _ separation of the energy scales _ controlling @xmath13 and its temperature dependence .",
    "more specifically , if one performs the frequency integral of @xmath0 up to a cut - off which includes both the drude and the mid infrared ( mir ) contribution , mimicking the experimental situation , a strong @xmath11-dependence of @xmath8 , and a qualitatively correct behavior of @xmath13 are obtained .    on the other hand , some discrepancy with the experimental observations",
    "is present also in the data of ref . :",
    "the dmft data , which are computed for a hubbard model with a semicircular dispersion which has no vhs , predict a stronger temperature dependence of @xmath10 at small doping than for the overdoped compounds , as a result of a larger distance from the mott transition , in contrast with experiments , where this effect is not seen , and even an opposite behavior occurs in bscco@xcite .",
    "one of the reasons for such a discrepancy is that dmft neglects spatial correlations .",
    "the effect of this neglect is expected to be stronger for smaller dopings@xcite .",
    "a consequence of the lack of spatial correlation is the vanishing quasiparticle renormalization factor @xmath38 ( renormalization of the coherent electronic bandwidth ) when @xmath39 in contrast with photoemission data , in which @xmath38 is finite for any doping .",
    "thus , a crucial step for a proper analysis of the small doping region is to consider cluster extensions of dmft able to capture at least short - range correlations ( such as cellular dmft@xcite and dca@xcite ) , where the mott transition can take place with a finite @xmath38 .",
    "present cluster - dmft studies have been mainly dedicated to the superconducting phase , which is not addressed in this paper@xcite .    in this work",
    "we do not address the cluster extensions of dmft , while we try to supplement our previous single - site dmft analysis by including the effects of a more realistic two - dimensional bandstructure displaying a vhs , which , as we commented above , can introduce remarkable effects for non interacting systems .",
    "keeping in mind the limitations of single - site dmft , we will not consider extremely small dopings , where non local correlations will become crucial .",
    "we notice in passing that the @xmath19 behavior of the sr is not limited to noninteracting systems , but it is rather characteristic of all fermi - liquid systems , either weakly or strongly correlated .",
    "the actual coefficient is generally a function of @xmath38 and of the imaginary part of the self - energy ( proportional to @xmath19 in a fermi - liquid ) .",
    "what correlation effects and interaction with bosonic modes can change are on one hand the actual values of the @xmath12 value and of the coefficient @xmath26 , as we have already found , and on the other hand they can introduce coherence scales which set the limit under which the system behaves like a fermi liquid . beyond that scale",
    "the temperature behavior can appear different from quadratic , but such a deviation is not necessarily the consequence of deep changes in the groundstate properties .",
    "in this paper we consider the two - dimensional hubbard model , i.e. , @xmath40 where @xmath41 are annihilation(creation ) operators for fermions of spin @xmath42 on site i , @xmath43 , and the sum in the first term includes nearest - neighbors ( nn ) and next - to - nearest neighbor ( nnn ) hopping processes , whose amplitudes are given by @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively .",
    "our choice of the parameter appearing in the hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) , namely @xmath46 aims to the closest contact with the cuprate properties . specifically , we concentrate on two of the most studied cuprates , i.e. , bscco and lsco , for which a certain agreement about the estimates of the hopping parameters has been reached both on the theoretical ( density - functional theory calculations ) and the experimental side ( photoemission ) . in particular ,",
    "for both bscco and lsco the nn hopping parameter @xmath47 is estimated around @xmath48 , while the different crystal structure of their unit cells reflects in different nnn hopping term : lda calculations predicts a @xmath49 for lsco , whereas larger values of @xmath45 are estimated for bscco @xmath50 .",
    "let us just note that , in the non - interacting case , these values correspond a vhs located at lower energy with respect to the half - filling chemical potential : in the case of @xmath51 ( lsco ) , the vhs would be crossed at a doping level slightly below @xmath52 , while for @xmath53 ( bscco ) the vhs would not be reached even for the higher doping levels relevant for the cuprates , being located roughly at @xmath54 .",
    "the choice of the value of the repulsive term @xmath55 is certainly less obvious : although the relevance of electron - electron correlations is widely , if not universally , accepted as a key element in the properties of the cuprates , it is difficult to estimate precisely its value . in this paper",
    ", we have chosen @xmath56 , consistently with ref .",
    ", which allows for a direct comparison with the results for the simpler semicircular dos used in that paper , and it allows for a clear separation between the mir and the hubbard contributions in the optical sum rule ( see next section ) .",
    "more generally , the choice of @xmath56 is also guided by experimental evidence from the neutron scattering data in the cuprates , which estimate the antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath57 mev .",
    "a recent dmft analysis suggests however that a slightly smaller value @xmath58 is more appropriate to describe the zero temperature optical spectra and their doping dependence.@xcite .",
    "as we anticipated , we use dmft to solve the hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) .",
    "dmft is a nonperturbative method that maps a lattice model onto an effective local model , in which the effect of the neighboring sites on a given site is expressed through a `` dynamical weiss field '' .",
    "the local effective model can be parameterized by an anderson impurity model ( aim ) , in which an interacting site is hybridized with a non interacting bath describing the weiss field . for more details",
    "we refer to ref . .",
    "the mean - field is enforced by a self - consistency condition which relates the green s function of the effective model to the local component of the lattice green s function of the original model .",
    "namely @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the green s function and the self - energy of the effective model and @xmath62 is the bare dispersion on the chosen lattice ( from now on , we are setting @xmath63 ) . the self - consistency condition requires to solve iteratively the aim until eq . ( [ selfcons ] )",
    "is obeyed . in this work",
    "we consider the two - dimensional dispersion @xmath64 , while in ref .",
    "we considered a simple semicircular density of states characteristic of an infinite coordination bethe lattice .",
    "we emphasize that the lattice structure enters the dmft only in the self - consistency condition .",
    "we use exact diagonalization ( ed ) to solve the aim . in this method",
    "the model can be solved at zero temperature by discretizing the bath function into a small number of levels , which here will be @xmath65 .",
    "the main limitation of the approach is that the spectral properties are those of a finite system , hence the fine details can not be resolved with great accuracy .",
    "this choice is particularly useful for the subject of this work , considering that we are interested in integrated optical spectra , rather than in their details , and that the temperatures of interest are very small with respect to the energy scales of the hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] ) ( the range of temperature @xmath66 corresponds to @xmath67 ) .",
    "in particular , the very low temperature range allows us to exploit the lanczos algorithm at finite @xmath11 , which has been developed for dmft in ref . .",
    "in this scheme we avoid to compute the whole spectrum of the hamiltonian , limiting to the relevant low - lying states , allowing for a faster calculation than the full diagonalization of the matrix .",
    "ad discussed in ref . and in several precedent works , the interpretation of the optical spectra in dmft can be greatly helped by an inspection of the single - particle spectral function .",
    "in particular the @xmath68integrated spectral function , namely the interacting density of states , can be easily computed through the knowledge of the retarded self - energy @xmath69 on the real axis    @xmath70    in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] we plot @xmath71 for @xmath72 , the smallest temperature we considered for two doping levels and for parameters corresponding to the two different materials .",
    "quite generally , the evolution of the density of states is analogous to the bethe lattice case and contains three features : ( i ) a strongly renormalized quasiparticle peak ( qp ) at the fermi level ( of width @xmath73 , where @xmath74 is the quasiparticle residue ) , which is basically attached to ( ii ) the lower hubbard band ( of width roughly equal to the bare bandwidth @xmath23 ) , and well separated from the upper hubbard band , whose center is located at @xmath75 , again with width close to @xmath23 .",
    "the weight of the qp clearly increases with the doping level , while the spectral gap between the qp and the hubbard bands appears rather stable in the range of doping considered ( being of order of @xmath76 ) .",
    "the effect of @xmath45 is hardly visible in @xmath71 and seems to affect mainly the shape of the qp , as can be seen by comparing the results for the two values of @xmath45 corresponding to bscco and lsco .     interacting density of states @xmath71 computed via dmft at low temperature ( @xmath77 ) for the case of @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) and @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) for two different values of doping .",
    "note the presence of a narrow qp at the fermi level , very close to the lower hubbard band , while the upper hubbard band is clearly visible at @xmath82 .",
    ", width=302,height=264 ]    information about the spectral function are particularly useful to understand optical spectra due to the simplifications introduced by dmft in this regard .",
    "the locality of @xmath61 and of the two - particle irreducible vertices in dmft , together with the odd symmetry of the current operator for @xmath83 determine in fact the vanishing of all the vertex corrections to the current - current paramagnetic kernel@xcite . as a consequence @xmath0",
    "can be computed via the simple `` bubble '' @xmath84 where @xmath85 , @xmath86 is the retarded green function , and finally @xmath87 the fermi function . for sake of simplicity , the normalization of eq .",
    "[ eq : sigma ] has been chosen so that @xmath8 is approaching directly the value of @xmath88 for @xmath89 .",
    "examples of the dmft results for @xmath0 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] for the same set of parameters of the dos of fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] .",
    "one can immediately recognize how the main features of @xmath71 discussed above reflect in @xmath0 .",
    "similarly to the results of ref . , the optical conductivity displays ( i ) a clear drude peak at low frequencies ( @xmath90 ) , determined by optical transitions occurring at energies within the qp width , then ( ii ) a mid infrared ( mir ) bump at @xmath91 , related to transitions between the qp and the lower hubbard band , and finally a high energy contribution at @xmath92 , which is related to transitions involving the upper hubbard band .    the rather neat separation between the low energy features ( drude and mir ) and the higher energy hubbard contribution suggests a value of @xmath93 as a natural cut - off to compare ( see next section ) our calculations with the experimental data .",
    "this choice has the same spirit of choosing the plasma frequency as a cut - off in the experiments in order to select only the contribution from the lowest absorption band . yet , for our choice of parameters , the cut - off we use is @xmath94 times larger than the plasma frequency of bscco and lsco , but using the experimental values in our calculations would result in including only a part of the mir in the integral , making the analysis less significant , at least in our view .",
    "optical conductivity @xmath0 computed via dmft at low temperature ( @xmath77 ) for the same parameters of fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] .",
    "one can immediately notice the narrow drude peak at low - frequency , a broader mir contribution at @xmath95 and a small hubbard term at higher frequencies.,width=302,height=264 ]",
    "in this section we analyze the results for the optical spectral weight @xmath8 of the hubbard model through direct numerical integration of the optical conductivity using a cut - off @xmath23 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : defw ] ) . from a theoretical point of view , it is also interesting to compare @xmath8 with the total @xmath96 ( including in this case also the hubbard contributions ) , given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tb2 ] ) , where @xmath97 .",
    "even if our focus is the dependence on temperature of these two quantities , a brief analysis of the @xmath12 behavior is necessary before moving to finite temperature . in fig .",
    "[ fig : w0tpri ] we report the values of the extrapolated @xmath12 values for @xmath8 and sr for three different doping levels for the set of hopping parameters which refer to bscco and lsco .",
    "both quantities increase as a function of doping , analogously to the bethe lattice case . in this respect , as one could have expected , considering a more realistic bandstructure dispersion reflects at most in minor corrections of the dmft results of ref , and in minor differences between the two compounds .",
    "this clearly shows that the strong correlation effects play the dominant role in determining the values of both @xmath25 and @xmath98 , regardless the shape of the non interacting bands .",
    "we notice that , apart from the natural difference ( which ranges from @xmath99 mev ) due to the contribution of the hubbard bands , the doping behavior of @xmath25 roughly tracks that of @xmath98 , since for the doping considered the magnitude of the frequency integral in the sr is mostly determined by the mir and the drude contributions .",

    "the results of the dmft calculations are reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : delwtpri ] , where the ratio between the value of @xmath100 ( and the sr ) and its corresponding @xmath12 extrapolation for the case of bscco and lsco at @xmath101 are shown as a function of temperature .",
    "we see immediately that for both bscco and lsco the relative variation @xmath102 between t=0 and room temperature ( in our units @xmath103 corresponds to @xmath104 ) is larger for the underdoped compounds and constantly decreasing with doping . for the case of bscco",
    "such trend is more pronounced than in the bethe lattice case@xcite and it is only partly due to the doping dependence of @xmath105 : a more quantitative analysis through a quadratic fit ( @xmath106 , solid lines in fig . [",
    "fig : delwtpri ] ) of the data at low @xmath11 clearly demonstrates that the main contribution to this results stems from a remarkable reduction of the coefficient @xmath26 , which controls the low-@xmath11 behavior .",
    "for instance , in the case of bscco @xmath107 at @xmath108 , and it decreases down to @xmath109 at @xmath110 . in the case of lsco ,",
    "the temperature variation at @xmath111 is very close to that at @xmath110 because @xmath26 has a minimum for doping slightly below the vhs .",
    "a second important observation is in order about the temperature dependence of the sum rule . with the only exception of overdoped lsco , in the parameter region considered here ,",
    "the temperature variation of @xmath112 is always bigger than that of @xmath113 ( for bscco by more than a factor @xmath114 ) : this results is therefore not determined simply by the small difference between @xmath25 and @xmath98 : the coefficient of the quadratic fit is always lower in the case of the @xmath96 indicating that the temperature dependence of the high - energy hubbard contribution has always the opposite sign with respect to that of @xmath8 .",
    "this should be taken into account when comparing theoretical prediction on the spectral weight computed in presence of strong interactions with the experimental data .",
    "this problem can be faced , e.g .",
    ", in cluster dmft , where the difficulty to evaluate the vertex corrections may suggest to resort to the calculation of the total sr .     relative variation with respect to @xmath12 of @xmath8 ( left column ) and of the total @xmath96 ( right column ) as a function of @xmath11 for bscco ( first row ) and lsco ( second row ) .",
    "the solid lines are the results of the quadratic fit at low temperatures ( see text).,width=302,height=264 ]    the main outcome of these dmft results is that in presence of a strong correlation the effects of the details of more realistic bandstructure are not very evident in the behavior of the integrated optical spectral weight . as one clearly sees in fig .",
    "[ fig : w0tpri ] and [ fig : delwtpri ] , the behavior of @xmath25 and of its dependence on temperature when the doping level is enhanced from @xmath108 to @xmath110 is dominated by the quasiparticle renormalization factor @xmath38 which obviously increases with the distance from the mott transition . in this respect ,",
    "our dmft results show that most of the peculiar trends determined by the two - dimensional density of states in a simple non - interacting scheme@xcite are washed out by strong interaction effects , so that the main outcomes of ref . remain unaltered .",
    "nonetheless we observe some effects of the more realistic bandstructure also in the presence of strong correlation , and the outcome is not completely obvious . in particular , one could have expected that , when the chemical potential moves close to a vhs , the largest temperature variation of @xmath8 would have be achieved , because the proximity to the vhs and the strong interaction could have cooperated summed up somehow their effects in making more pronounced the @xmath11-dependence of @xmath8 .",
    "this is apparently not the case , since the vhs is reached at a doping level slightly below @xmath52 for @xmath80 and larger than @xmath110 for bscco , and no trace of any enhancement in the @xmath11-dependence of the spectral weight is found there .",
    "quite remarkably , instead , one can observe that in bscco the weakening of the @xmath11-dependence of @xmath8 with increasing doping is more evident than in the bethe lattice , where no vhs is present , case@xcite , and that in lsco the change of the temperature variation for doping levels below the vhs ( i.e. , @xmath111 and @xmath110 ) is smaller than expected .",
    "this clearly suggest that the proximity to a vhs and the strong interaction effects are partially competitive .",
    "it is worth underlying that no evidence of the change of sign of the temperature variation when the chemical potential crosses the vhs is found in the lsco data for @xmath111 and @xmath115 as opposed to the non interacting case studied in ref . .",
    "an extremely simple scheme to understand the origin of these partly unexpected dmft results will be discussed in the next section .",
    "in this section we will present a simple explanation of the surprising interplay between vhs and strong correlations displayed in dmft . as we discuss below , the main idea behind",
    "our explanation is to introduce a simple cartoon for the correlated system , where the sr is given by the value obtained for a non interacting case with bands renormalized by the factor @xmath38 obtained in dmft .",
    "the starting point of our arguments is the temperature dependence of the total @xmath96 at @xmath116 , which was already analyzed in ref . , and it is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : somm ] for the bandstructure parameter considered here and different doping levels .",
    "it is worth noticing that , as it was pointed out in ref .",
    ", the low temperature behavior ( which can be obtained also directly via the sommerfeld expansion ) displays remarkable changes for density close to the vhs .",
    "in particular , defining @xmath117 as the doping corresponding to the chemical potential at the vhs ( i.e. , @xmath118 ) , when @xmath14 approaches @xmath117 from below one observes a strong - enhancement of the slope of the @xmath119 at low @xmath11 , while as soon as @xmath120 ( e.g. , @xmath121 for bscco , and @xmath52 for lsco ) the _ sign _ of the slope changes abruptlyto positive , in contrast to natural expectation ( and experimental evidence ) , before changing again sign for higher doping levels .",
    "one should also note that , as a consequence of the big and rapid changes occurring close to the vhs , the temperature behavior of @xmath96 can deviate rather remarkably from the standard @xmath19 behavior _  la _ sommerfeld .     relative variation with respect to @xmath12 of the sr for a non interacting system with parameters of bscco and lsco.,width=302,height=207 ]    as we mentioned in the previous section",
    ", however , most of these vhs effects , clearly visible in the non - interacting case , are quite weakened ( and , in some cases , they even disappear ) in our dmft results , as a consequence of the strong correlation .",
    "to understand the reason for this effect we observe that in the non interacting systems the anomalous behavior of the sr due to the vhs is always limited to a small temperature range , whose size becomes smaller and smaller as the vhs is approached .",
    "if we consider that in presence of the strong interaction the low - temperature physics should be mainly controlled by the strongly renormalized qp at the fermi level ( see again the dos reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos ] ) , one can reasonably expect that correlations determine a reduction ( by a factor @xmath38 ) of the size of the low - temperature region which is controlled by the vhs .",
    "in particular , if the qp is strongly renormalized , as in the case we have considered here ( the @xmath38 evaluated in dmft ranges between @xmath122 for bscco at @xmath108 and @xmath123 for lsco at @xmath110 ) , the effects of the vhs should be limited to temperatures so low to become hardly visible in the experiments and in the temperature range we considered in our dmft results .",
    "we can try to test this generic idea by mimicking the strongly interacting fermi liquid physics by simply rescaling by a factor @xmath38 the energy scale of the non interacting system .",
    "more precisely , the renormalization of the qp peak determines a renormalization of the coefficient @xmath26 of the @xmath19 term ( @xmath124 because @xmath26 has the dimensions of the inverse of an energy ) , this means that the scaled results can be simply obtained by replotting the data of fig .",
    "[ fig : somm ] rescaling the @xmath11 dependence of the sr for a given doping level , with the square root of @xmath38 extracted from dmft ( i.e. , @xmath125 ) .",

    "[ fig : somm_resc ] . even at first glance",
    ", one can notice that the peculiar features associated to the vhs are much less evident now , and that the rescaled data resemble in many respects the outcome of the full dmft calculation . more specifically",
    ", the slope of sr(t ) does not change sign but in a very low temperature regime , with the exception of the bscco at @xmath121 , which is however above the doping regime of our interest .",
    "the same consideration applies to the increasing of the slope , which is observed for @xmath126 in the non interacting case , and which is now limited to a very tiny low - temperature regime .",
    "these results explain why , in the presence of a strong correlation , the effect of the vhs is not only small , but even _ opposite _ to what one can expect from a sommerfeld expansion at @xmath116 : the deviation from the low - t `` sommerfeld '' regime occurs really at very low t , partly reducing the effect of the qp renormalization on the overall variation of @xmath96 between @xmath12 and @xmath127 . as a second point , one can note that , apart small deviations , the low temperature behavior of the sum rule can be considered to first approximation quadratic , in agreement with dmft calculations and with most of the experimental measurements .",
    "one should also remark that , after the rescaling , the size of the temperature variation of the sr becomes much closer ( some percent going from @xmath12 to @xmath128 ) to that of the dmft data and the experimental observations , while even at the doping of the vhs the overall relative variation of sr does not exceed @xmath129 .    although one can not expect this oversimplified analysis to reproduce exactly all the dmft results ( e.g.",
    ", it would predict a slightly smaller temperature variation with respect to dmft for lsco ) , it sheds light on the essence of the physics which determines the sum rule behavior in the presence of strong correlation .",
    "more precisely it indicates rather clearly that the main features of the integrated optical spectra are determined by the physics of a strongly renormalized fermi liquid , and the effects of the two - dimensional bandstructure are generally small .",
    "in this manuscript we presented a dmft study of the optical sumrules of the two - dimensional hubbard model , aiming to understand the interplay of the strong electron - electron correlations and the properties of the two - dimensional density of states , namely the van hove singularity .",
    "even if both correlations@xcite and the vhs singularity@xcite have been invoked to explain the anomalously large temperature dependence of the optical spectral weight , the two effects are found not to be cooperative .",
    "our dmft analysis shows that correlations actually reduce the effect of the vhs on the optical sumrules .",
    "the mechanism underlying this reduced effect is a shrinking of the temperature scale below which the effects of the vhs are appreciable . when correlations are strong ( namely in doped cuprates ) this effective temperature scale becomes lower than the temperatures accessed in the experiments .",
    "this means that the inclusion of a more realistic bandstructure can not alterate the conclusions of ref .",
    "about the necessity of considering strong correlations to get the correct order of magnitude of observed t - dependence of the optical spectral weight in the cuprates ( as well as the doping dependence of its @xmath12 extrapolation ) . at the same time",
    ", our results imply that the almost negligible doping dependence of the temperature variation of @xmath100 which has been clearly observed in several experiments , can not be explained within a pure dmft calculation , even including the effects of a more realistic bandstructure .    in this respect ,",
    "non - local corrections beyond the dmft level certainly play a role , since they can introduce different renormalizations for the hopping parameters and the qp weight , and the physics of the mott transition can become richer , including for example pseudogap features at low temperatures .",
    "the inclusion of such non local effects certainly represent an interesting challenge for future studies .",
