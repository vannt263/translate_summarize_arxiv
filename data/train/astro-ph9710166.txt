    "the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) method has been recently used for estimating the distances to several nearby galaxies ( see , e.g , the list in salaris & cassisi 1997 ) ; lee , freedman & madore ( 1993 - hereinafter lfm93 ) and madore & freedman ( 1995 ) assessed the reliability and intrinsic accuracy of this method , and demonstrated that the trgb can be successfully used for determining distances accurate within 0.2 mag for galaxies out to 3 mpc by using ground - based telescopes , and out to 12 - 13 mpc by using the _",
    "hst_.    the underlying physical mechanism which allows to use the trgb as a standard candle is the following : the trgb marks the helium ignition inside the degenerate core of low - mass stars , and its brightness depends on the he core mass , which is remarkably constant for ages larger than a few billions of years .    a fundamental ingredient for using the trgb as a distance indicator is the calibration of its bolometric magnitude ( @xmath3 ) as a function of [ m / h ] .",
    "the relation generally used until now is the semiempirical one by da costa & armandroff ( 1990 - hereinafter da90 ) , based on the observational database by frogel , persson & cohen ( 1983 - hereinafter fpc83 ) of bolometric magnitudes for rgb stars in a sample of galactic globular clusters ( hereinafter gc ) .",
    "the observed @xmath4 of the most luminous red giants are converted into absolute magnitudes adopting distance moduli for the parent gc obtained by using the rr lyrae distance scale by lee , demarque & zinn ( 1990 ) , and these absolute magnitudes fix the zero point of the trgb distances . as discussed in salaris & cassisi ( 1997 )",
    "this procedure provides a zero point too faint ( independently of the accuracy of the lee , demarque & zinn rr lyrae distance scale ) ; the reason is the small sample of stars observed by fpc83 .",
    "taking into account the evolutionary times along the rgb and the observed sample of stars , it is possible to compute statistically the probability that the most luminous observed star is actually at the trgb ; the result is that this probability is very small , indicating clearly that the trgb brightness is systematically underestimated .    in this paper",
    "we will present a purely theoretical calibration of the trgb brightness as a function of [ m / h ] as obtained from updated evolutionary computations , and we will compare the distance scale set by our trgb luminosities with rr lyrae , hipparcos and cepheid distances . once assessed the reliability of our calibration , we will apply the trgb method for the determination of the hubble constant .",
    "we have determined the trgb luminosities for stellar populations with age t=15 gyr ( but , as discussed before and in salaris & cassisi 1997 , the precise value of t does not influence the trgb luminosities for ages larger than a few gyr ) and metallicity @xmath5\\le-0.28 $ ] ( the he abundance is set to y=0.23 with the exception of the case with [ m / h]=-0.28 , where we adopted y=0.255 ) , by computing evolutionary tracks of low - mass stars without chemical elements diffusion .",
    "as far as it concerns the physical inputs adopted in computing the stellar models , the interested reader is referred to salaris & cassisi ( 1997 ) .",
    "assuming for the sun @xmath6 mag , we obtain the following relation : @xmath7 + 0.008\\cdot{[m / h]}^2   \\label{mboltip}\\ ] ] this relation takes also automatically into account the enhancement of the @xmath8 elements observed in galactic field halo and gc stars when considering the global metallicity [ m / h ] ( see salaris , chieffi & straniero 1993 ) .",
    "it is moreover possible to correct this relation for different he contents around the values we have adopted , taking into account that on average @xmath9 is @xmath10 in the metallicity range covered by equation 1 .    in order to estimate the internal accuracy of the current theoretical scenario , in figure 1",
    "we have compared our equation [ mboltip ] with similar relations derived by independent updated stellar models .",
    "we compared our results with the ones by cassisi et al .",
    "( 1997 - their step8 , with and without he and heavy elements diffusion ) , caloi et al .",
    "( 1997 - no diffusion ) and straniero et al .",
    "( 1997 - no diffusion ) . in the same figure",
    "the relation provided by da90 is shown after correcting for the slightly different @xmath11 adopted by the quoted authors .",
    "it is important to note that the agreement between the different recent evolutionary results is quite good .",
    "all the theoretical relations lie within @xmath120.05 mag with respect to equation [ mboltip ] . moreover , the change of the trgb brightness due to the inclusion of atomic diffusion - adopting the same physical inputs as in standard models - results to be quite negligible ( see the results corresponding to the cassisi et al . 1997 models ) .",
    "finally , it exists a systematic difference by about 0.15 mag in the zero point between our relation and the relation provided by da90 ( while the slopes are in good agreement ) , our trgb brightnesses being higher .",
    "= 6.7 cm      before going on , we wish to briefly review the iterative procedure suggested by lmf93 in order to derive distances by means of the trgb method from observations in the vi johnson - cousins bands of resolved galaxies .",
    "the first step consists in fixing a preliminar distance modulus ; with this fixed distance modulus one determines the metallicity by measuring the dereddened @xmath13 color at @xmath14 mag ( @xmath15 ) and using a relation between this color and the metallicity of the parent stellar population ( see section 3.1 ) . as a second step , with this estimate of [ m / h ] and the observed i magnitude of the trgb ( corrected for the interstellar extinction ) , one redetermines the distance modulus by adopting a relation for both the trgb bolometric magnitude as a function of metallicity and the bolometric correction to the i magnitude ( @xmath16 ) . at this point ,",
    "one iterates the procedure until convergency is achieved . due to the weak dependence of @xmath17 on the metallicity",
    ", convergence is generally achieved after one iteration .    for applying this procedure ,",
    "it is therefore necessary to have a relation providing the bolometric correction to the i ( cousins ) band .",
    "following lfm93 , an empirical @xmath18 relation for rgb stars has been taken from da90 ( @xmath19 is the dereddened color of the considered rgb stars ) : @xmath20 , independent of the metallicity .",
    "this empirical relation was derived by comparing the i magnitudes given in da90 with the bolometric magnitudes given by fpc83 for a sample of rgb stars in 8 gc with different metallicities . by examining figure 14 in da90",
    ", it appears clearly that in the range of @xmath19 values typical of the stars considered by the authors ( @xmath19 colors between 1.0 and 1.6 ) and of the trgb stars in the sample of galaxies studied in section 3.2 ( @xmath19 colors between 1.3 and 2.0 ) , there is a dispersion of the order of 0.10 mag around the least square fit that they give .",
    "moreover , the relation for the reddest stars is based only on a very small number of observational points .",
    "we have therefore used two other independent sets of @xmath16 for better assessing the uncertainty in the trgb distances due to the bolometric correction scale .    by using the theoretical bolometric corrections by castelli , gratton & kurucz ( 1997a , 1997b - hereinafter k97 ) and the semiempirical ones by green ( 1988 - hereinafter yale transformations ) ,",
    "we have obtained the following relations :    @xmath21 + 0.147\\cdot[m / h]^2 \\label{mik97}\\ ] ]    @xmath22 + 0.070\\cdot[m / h]^2   \\label{miyale}\\ ] ]    all these three different sets of @xmath16 will be used in the next sections for deriving trgb distances to a sample of resolved galaxies .",
    "in the case of galactic gc it is possible to compare the rr lyrae distance scale with the one derived from equation [ mboltip ] . for determining the rr lyrae distance scale",
    "we have here adopted the zero age horizontal branch ( hereinafter zahb ) models from cassisi & salaris ( 1997 ) , homogeneus with the models adopted for deriving the trgb luminosities .",
    "our zahb models have been transformed into the observational plane by using both the yale and k97 transformations .",
    "the relations between the zahb v magnitude ( taken at @xmath23 , that corresponds approximately to the average temperature of the rr lyrae instability strip ) and [ m / h ] obtained from these two sets of transformations agree within 0.03 mag . in the following",
    "we adopt for fixing the rr lyrae distance scale the relation ( valid for @xmath5\\le-0.57 $ ] ) :    @xmath24 + 0.045\\cdot[m / h]^2 \\label{rryale}\\ ] ]    the trgb bolometric magnitudes published by fpc83 for a sample of gc with accurate spectroscopic determinations of [ m / h ] ( see salaris & cassisi 1996 ) have been corrected for our zahb distance scale ( see cassisi & salaris 1997 and salaris & cassisi 1997 for details about the procedure followed for determining the observational zahb level at the instability strip ) , so that the comparison displayed in figure 2 between the observational @xmath25 values and our equation [ mboltip ] is a comparison between our zahb and trgb distances .",
    "the vertical error bar ( @xmath26 mag ) for the observational points represents an average error on the distance modulus obtained from equation [ rryale ] while the error on the spectroscopic determination of [ m / h ] is typically of the order of 0.15 dex .",
    "data in figure 2 show quite clearly that equation [ mboltip ] constitutes an upper envelope to the distribution of the observational points ( with the exception of one cluster , namely ngc6352 ; in this case , according to fpc83 , the star considered to be at the trgb could also be a field star .",
    "the second more luminous observed rgb star is @xmath27 0.3 mag fainter ) , that are all contained within 0.4 - 0.5 mag from equation [ mboltip ] .",
    "this is exactly what expected on the basis of simple statistical arguments ( see salaris & cassisi 1997 ) , when the evolutionary times in the upper part of the rgb and the number of stars observed in each cluster are taken into account .",
    "this means that the theoretical trgb and zahb distance scales in gcs are in agreement within the statistical uncertainties due to the small sample of red giant stars observed .",
    "= 6.5 cm    once assessed the consistency between trgb and zahb distance scale for gc , we have compared our gc zahb distances with distance moduli taken from the recent literature , derived from the main sequence fitting ( hereinafter msf ) technique using subdwarfs with accurate hipparcos parallaxes .",
    "the sources of the gc msf distances are gratton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , reid ( 1997 ) and chaboyer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) .",
    "in figure 3 ( panels a - c ) we display the results of this comparison ; the error bars on the msf distances are taken from the quoted papers .",
    "due to the different procedures adopted by the various authors , the differences between the distance moduli obtained for the gcs in common among these three investigations give us a rough estimate of the intrinsic error of the msf technique .",
    "it is worth noticing that on average there is a good agreement between our zahb distance scale and the hipparcos msf distances . for the most metal",
    "poor ( and more distant ) clusters displayed in the figure , the reid ( 1997 ) data seem to disagree systematically with our zahb distances , but on the contrary the same m68 distance derived by gratton et al .",
    "( 1997 ) nicely agrees with the zahb distance .",
    "in particular , in the case of m5 and ngc6752 the distance moduli derived from the msf by the three different groups are almost identical , and the agreement with the zahb distance scale is almost perfect .",
    "we can therefore finally conclude that for gc the hipparcos , trgb and zahb distance scales are in agreement one with each other within the present errors .",
    "once assessed the consistency between trgb , zahb and hipparcos distances , the distance scale set by equation [ rryale ] can be also used for reliably calibrating a relation providing [ m / h ] as a function of @xmath15 , by adopting a sample of gc for which v-(v - i ) c - m diagrams ( as given by da90 ) and accurate spectroscopical [ m / h ] measurements ( as listed in salaris & cassisi 1996 ) are available ; this relation is needed for applying the trgb method to resolved galaxies .",
    "we obtain : @xmath28=-39.27 + 64.69\\cdot[(v - i)_{0,-3.5 } ] - 36.35\\cdot[(v - i)_{0,-3.5}]^2 + 6.84\\cdot[(v - i)_{0,-3.5}]^3    \\label{vi35}\\ ] ]      in the case of resolved galaxies , we can compare the trgb distance scale with the cepheid and the rr lyrae ones .",
    "the observational database used in this comparison is the one in salaris & cassisi ( 1997 ) , with the additional data for sextans b taken from sakai , madore & freedman ( 1997 ) . in table 2 we report the distance modulus determinations as obtained with the three different methods .",
    "the various columns provide the following data : ( 1 ) the name of the object ; ( 2 ) the reddening ; ( 3 ) the observed i magnitude of the trgb ; ( 4 ) the mean rgb metallicity , as obtained by adopting equation [ vi35 ] and the distance moduli in column 8 ; ( 5 ) the intrinsic cepheid distance on the scale by madore & freedman ( 1991 ) , with the zero point set by a lmc distance modulus of 18.50 mag and @xmath29 ; ( 6 ) the true distance obtained by using the mean rr lyrae v magnitude ( for details about the conversion from mean rr lyrae brightness to the corresponding zahb one see cassisi & salaris 1997 .",

    "rr lyrae distances for the sample of galaxies in table 2 are on average of the order of 0.15 mag .",
    "it is important to remember that the [ m / h ] values given in column 4 of table 2 are derived from rgb stars , and correspond to an average metallicity of this stellar population , that for the sample of galaxies in table 2 shows generally a spread in [ m / h ] ( this spread does not introduce a big error on the trgb distances , since the weak dependence of @xmath30 on the metallicity ) . in principle",
    "this average rgb metal content could be different from the rr lyrae one , especially for the highest and lowest values of [ m / h ] displayed in table 2 , due to the low probability that metal - poor and metal - rich rgb stars evolve during their he central burning phase through the rr lyrae instability strip . for roughly estimating the uncertainty due to the unknown original metal content of the rr lyrae population , the distance moduli obtained assuming for the rr lyrae stars an average metallicity equal to",
    "[ m / h]=@xmath31 - adopted as a reasonable estimate of the average metallicity for the galactic halo rr lyrae population - have been reported in column 7 of table 2 ( with the unique exception of the lmc ; in this case we have a determination for the metallicity of the considered rr lyrae ) .",
    "when comparing trgb distances determined with the three @xmath16 scales presented in section 2.2 , we obtain that the average difference adopting respectively the da90 and yale bolometric correction scales is @xmath32=-0.06@xmath330.06 mag , while the average difference when considering the da90 and the k97 @xmath16 is @xmath34=-0.08@xmath330.06 mag .",
    "as already discussed in section 2.2 , these differences can be considered as a rough estimate of the error on the trgb distances due to the uncertainty on the bolometric correction scale .",
    "moreover , the values of @xmath32 and @xmath34 are fully compatible with the dispersion of the observational points around the empirical @xmath16 scale by da90 ( see discussion in section 2.2 ) . in table 2 and in the following",
    "we have adopted , for the trgb distance of each galaxy , the value obtained by averaging the three distance moduli corresponding to the three different @xmath35 scales .    a comparison between trgb and rr lyrae distances ( when one neglects the very discrepant point corresponding to ngc205 ; see also the discussion in lfm93 about this galaxy ) , considering for the rr lyrae the same mean metallicity of the rgb stars , gives an average difference @xmath36=0.07@xmath330.09 mag ; when considering ( with the exception of the lmc ) a metallicity [ m / h]=-1.5 , one obtains an average difference @xmath36=0.02@xmath330.09 mag .",
    "one can therefore conclude that the rr lyrae and trgb distance scales agree well , at the level of less than 0.10 mag , when considering our sample of resolved galaxies .    in figure 4",
    ", we have displayed the difference between the distance moduli obtained by adopting the trgb and the cepheid distance scale .",
    "the average difference @xmath37 between the two scales is equal to 0.12@xmath330.06 mag , the trgb distances being systematically larger , in good agreement with the difference obtained considering only the lmc . since the good agreement between zahb and trgb distances , and the agreement between zahb and hipparcos distance scales discussed in the previous section , this systematic offset between the trgb and cepheid distance scales supports , within the limits of the small sample of galaxy considered , the results by feast & catchpole ( 1997 ) , gratton et al .",
