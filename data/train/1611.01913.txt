    "the compton and schwarzschild lines intersect at around the planck scales , @xmath35 and naturally divide the @xmath25 diagram in fig .  [ mr ] into three regimes , which for convenience we label quantum , relativistic and classical .",

    "there are several other interesting lines in fig .",
    "[ mr ] . the vertical line @xmath37 marks the division between elementary particles ( @xmath38 ) and black holes ( @xmath5 ) , since the event horizon of a black hole is usually required to be larger than the compton wavelength associated with its mass .",
    "the horizontal line @xmath39 is significant because quantum fluctuations in the metric should become important below this @xcite .",
    "quantum gravity effects should also be important whenever the density exceeds the planck value , @xmath40 , corresponding to the sorts of curvature singularities associated with the big bang or the centres of black holes @xcite .",
    "this implies @xmath41 , which is well above the @xmath42 line in fig .",
    "[ mr ] for @xmath43 , so one might regard the shaded region as specifying the ` quantum gravity ' domain .",
    "this point has recently been invoked to support the notion of planck stars @xcite and could have important implications for the detection of evaporating black holes @xcite .",
    "although the compton and schwarzschild boundaries correspond to straight lines in the logarithmic plot of fig .",
    "[ mr ] , this form presumably breaks down near the planck point due to quantum gravity effects .",
    "one might envisage two possibilities : either there is a smooth minimum , so the the compton and schwarzschild lines in some sense merge , or there is some form of phase transition or critical point at the planck scale , so that the separation between particles and black holes is maintained .",
    "which alternative applies could have important implications for the relationship between elementary particles and black holes @xcite .",
    "one way of obtaining a smooth transition between the compton and schwarzschild lines is to invoke the generalized uncertainty principle ( gup ) @xcite .",
    "as one approaches the planck point from the left , this implies that the compton wavelength is replaced by an expression of the form @xcite",
    "@xmath44   \\ , , \\ ] ] where @xmath45 is a dimensionless constant ( normally assumed to be positive ) .",
    "this might be regarded as a ` generalized ' compton wavelength , the last term representing a small correction due to gravitational effects .",
    "even if the gup is rejected , gup - type phenomenology can be obtained via an alternative route , by extending the de broglie relations to super - planckian energies @xcite .",
    "less attention has been paid to what happens when the black hole radius approaches the intersect point from the right .",

    "this is termed the generalized event horizon ( geh ) and represents a small perturbation of the schwarzschild radius in the limit @xmath49 .",
    "although eqs .",

    "although there is no reason for anticipating these values , the factor of two in the expression for the schwarzschild radius is precise , whereas the coefficient associated with the compton wavelength is somewhat arbitrary , so this motivates an alternative approach in which the free constant in eq .",

    "( [ geh1 ] ) .",
    "what happens as one approaches the planck point from the left and right are therefore linked .",
    "the suggestion that there is some connection between the uncertainty principle on microscopic scales and black holes on macroscopic scales is termed the black hole uncertainty principle ( bhup ) correspondence @xcite and it is manifested in a unified expression for the compton wavelength and schwarzschild radius . we also describe this as the compton - schwarzschild correspondence when discussing an interpretation in terms of extended de broglie relations @xcite . more generally , this correspondence might allow any unified expression @xmath56 which has the asymptotic behaviour @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 for @xmath49 .",
    "one could envisage many other unified expressions satisfying this condition but they would only be well motivated if based upon some final theory of quantum gravity .",
    "the bhup correspondence suggests that there is a different kind of positional uncertainty for an object larger than the planck mass , related to the existence of black holes .",
    "this is not unreasonable since the compton wavelength of a particle is smaller than the planck length in this region , so its physical meaning is unclear .",
    "in addition , an outside observer can not localize an object on a scale smaller than its schwarzschild radius .",
    "there are three important mathematical features of the bhup correspondence @xcite .",
    "the first is the smooth transition between the compton and schwarzschild lines in fig .",
    "[ mr ] , as indicated by the broken line .",
    "the second is the duality between the two lines under the transformation @xmath2 .",
    "the third is the implication that there could be black holes in the sub - planckian regime ( @xmath38 ) with radius @xmath32 for @xmath58 . in this paper , we are mainly concerned with the second feature , most of our considerations being independent of the bhup correspondence .",
    "however , our conclusions have important implications for the other two features and we discuss these elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the black hole boundary in fig .  [ mr ] assumes there are three spatial dimensions but many theories suggest that dimensionality could increase on small scales . in particular ,",
    "superstring theory is consistent only in @xmath60 spacetime dimensions , even though our observable universe is @xmath61-dimensional . in current string theory models ,",
    "ordinary matter is described by open strings , whose end - points are confined to a @xmath62-dimensional @xmath63-brane , while gravity is described by closed strings that propagate in the bulk @xcite .",
    "it is therefore possible for our universe to be either a @xmath64-brane or a @xmath63-brane , which is compactified on @xmath65 extra dimensions . in either case , current experiments would be unable to directly probe the higher - dimensional nature of spacetime if the compactification scales were sufficiently small .",
    "however , there is a crucial qualitative difference between the two scenarios . in the first",
    ", matter is confined to the three visible dimensions ; in the second , it can probe at least some of the extra dimensions at high energies and this more general scenario is considered in this paper . an additional motivation for this",
    "is that the @xmath64-brane of the first scenario is expected to have some thickness in quantum theory and this might be interpreted as an effective compactification scale for the confined matter .",
    "this motivates us to consider the behavior of black holes and quantum mechanical particles in spacetimes with extra directions . for simplicity , we begin by assuming that all the extra dimensions in which matter is free to propagate are compactified on a single length scale @xmath7 . if there are @xmath6 extra dimensions , and black holes with @xmath66 are assumed to be approximately spherically symmetric with respect to the full @xmath10-dimensional space , then the schwarzschild radius is given by @xcite @xmath67 for @xmath68 , so the slope of the black hole boundary in fig .",
    "[ mr ] becomes shallower .",
    "the question now arises of whether the @xmath23 dependence of @xmath14 is also affected by the extra dimensions .",
    "the usual assumption is that it is not , so that one still has @xmath11 . in this case , the intersect of the schwarzschild and compton lines is changed , so that the effective higher - dimensional planck mass decreases ( allowing the possibility of tev quantum gravity ) and the effective higher - dimensional planck length increases @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we will argue that in some circumstances one expects @xmath69 for @xmath70 .",
    "in this case , the effective planck length is changed but not the planck mass , so that there can be no tev quantum gravity regime . on the other hand ,",
    "the duality between @xmath14 and @xmath15 is preserved and we will see that this has interesting physical implications .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows .",

    "[ sec.3 ] then considers how this relates to the derivation of the standard expression for the compton wavelength .",
    "[ sec.4 ] discusses the ( well - known ) expression for the schwarzschild radius for a ( @xmath72)-dimensional black hole .",

    "[ sec.6 ] shows how the expression for the higher - dimensional compton wavelength can be related to a ` compton temperature ' , which is dual to the hawking temperature of a black hole in @xmath72 dimensions .",
    "[ sec.7 ] explores the consequences of our claim for the detectability of primordial black hole evaporations and recent @xmath16-particle scattering results .",
    "[ sec.8 ] gives some general conclusions and suggestions for future work .",
    "a more complete discussion of fig .",
    "[ mr ] is presented in the appendix .",
    "in the form originally derived by heisenberg , the uncertainty principle states that the product of the ` uncertainties ' in the position and momentum of a quantum mechanical particle is of order of or greater than the reduced planck s constant @xmath73 @xcite .",
    "more generally , the rigorous definition of the uncertainty @xmath74 for an operator @xmath75 is the standard deviation for a large number @xmath76 of ( absolutely precise ) repeated measurements of an ensemble of identically prepared systems described by the wave vector @xmath77 : @xmath78 formally , this expression corresponds to the limit @xmath79 and is generally @xmath80-dependent .",
    "thus , the uncertainty @xmath74 does not correspond to incomplete knowledge about the value of the property @xmath81 for the system , since @xmath77 need not possess a definite value of @xmath81 .",

    "@xcite , can also be given a measurement - independent interpretation since , from a purely mathematical perspective , @xmath89 and @xmath90 represent the ` widths ' of the wave function in the relevant physical space or phase space , regardless of whether a measurement is actually performed .",
    "for the operators @xmath91 and @xmath92 , defined by @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the commutation relation @xmath95 = i\\hbar$ ] gives @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 correspond to the standard deviations of @xmath99 in position space and @xmath100 in momentum space , respectively .",
    "this formulation of the uncertainty principle for @xmath91 and @xmath101 was first given in refs .",
    "@xcite and , for this choice of operators , the @xmath80-dependent terms in eq .",
    "( [ sup ] ) are of subleading order , in accordance with heisenberg s original result .",
    "the underlying wave - vector in the hilbert space of the theory is identical in either the physical or momentum space representations , which correspond to different choices for the basis vectors in the expansion of @xmath80 @xcite .",
    "although @xmath97 and @xmath98 do _ not _ refer to any unavoidable ` noise ' , ` error ' or ` disturbance ' introduced into the system by the measurement process , this was how heisenberg interpreted his original result @xcite . in order to distinguish between quantities representing such noise and the standard deviation of repeated measurements which do not disturb the state @xmath102 prior to wave function collapse",
    ", we use the notation @xmath103 for the former and @xmath104 for the latter .- dependent .",

    "it is well known that one can heuristically understand this result as reflecting the momentum transferred to the particle by a probing photon .",
    "however , such a statement must be viewed as a postulate , with no rigorous foundation in the underlying mathematical structure of quantum theory .",
    "indeed , as a postulate , it has recently been shown to be manifestly false , both theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite .    despite this , the heuristic derivation of eq .",

    "( [ sup ] ) from basic mathematical principles ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , it is not always made clear that the quantities involved in each expression are different , as clarified by the pioneering work of ozawa @xcite .",
    "an excellent discussion of the various possible meanings and ( often confused ) interpretations of symbols like ` @xmath106 ' is given in @xcite . throughout the rest of this paper , unless explicitly stated , we consider only uncertainties of the form @xmath104 , defined in eq .",
    "( [ sd ] ) , and uncertainty relations derived from the general formula eq .",
    "( [ sup ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , eq .  ( [ sup ] ) is also sometimes referred to as the generalized uncertainty principle or generalized uncertainty relation ( see , for example , @xcite ) . to avoid confusion , throughout this paper we use the term _ general _ uncertainty principle to refer to the most general uncertainty relation obtained from the hilbert space structure of standard non - relativistic quantum mechanics ( for arbitrary operators ) and the term _ generalized _ uncertainty principle to refer to the amended uncertainty relation for position and momentum in non - canonical theories .",
    "the compton wavelength is defined as @xmath107 and first appeared historically in the expression for the compton cross - section in the scattering of photons off electrons .",
    "subsequently , it has arisen in various other contexts and it is important to distinguish these when discussing how the expression for the compton wavelength is modified in higher - dimensional models . the reduced compton wavelength @xmath108 appears naturally in the klein - gordon and dirac equations but the non - reduced expression is relevant in processes which involve turning photon energy ( @xmath109 ) into mass ( @xmath110 ) .",
    "other arguments associate the compton wavelength with the _ localisation _ of a particle and this will be relevant when we come to discuss the modifications required with extra dimensions . generally speaking ,",
    "the arguments are of two types , involving either the relativistic energy - momentum relation , together with the de broglie relations , or the uncertainty principle for position and momentum from non - relativistic quantum mechanics , together with some ` relativistic ' arguments of a more dubious nature .",
    "we briefly review the former argument in sec .",
    "[ sec.3.1 ] , for the sake of completeness , but it is the latter which chiefly concerns us in this paper and its primary deficiencies are discussed in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec.3.2 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec.3.3 ] , we present an original alternative argument for identifying the maximum possible uncertainty in the momentum @xmath111 with the rest mass of the particle in order to obtain a minimum value of the position uncertainty @xmath112 .",
    "[ sec.3.4 ] gives some additional comments about the relation between the compton and schwarzschild lines in the standard 3-dimensional case .",
    "the relativistic energy - momentum relation is @xmath113 , where @xmath114 is the magnitude of the particle s @xmath12-momentum , @xmath23 is its rest mass and @xmath115 is the lorentz factor .",
    "one interpretation of the compton wavelength formula is that when @xmath116 , the particle possesses sufficient energy to pair - produce copies of itself and its antiparticle .",
    "combining this condition with the de broglie relation @xmath117 and @xmath118 gives @xmath119 , so we require @xmath120 to prevent this .",
    "thus @xmath14 acts as a fundamental barrier beyond which pair - production occurs rather than further localization of the wave packet of the original particle . while it is true that the particle has sufficient energy to produce copies of itself for @xmath121 , it is also necessary that both the @xmath12-momentum in a given inertial frame and the @xmath122-momentum in any inertial frame are conserved for physically allowed transitions .",
    "additional quantum numbers may need to be conserved , depending on the particle s properties and the precise details of the quantum field theory that describes its interactions .",
    "an allied argument uses the fact that , in order to determine some physical property of a quantum particle , we must probe it using another kind of quantum particle . the simplest example is probing a particle of rest mass @xmath23 with a photon in order to determine its position . when the photon energy is greater than twice the rest energy of the particle whose position we wish to determine , @xmath123 , the interaction may again result in pair - production of particles of rest mass @xmath23 , rather than further localization of the original wave packet @xcite .",
    "the same caveats hold as before , regardless of what type of particle we probe or probe with .",
    "likewise , it is well known that attempts to confine a particle within a radius less than its compton wavelength result in pair - production @xcite , even if the energy required is derived from a confining potential ( rather than a probe particle ) , as required for the resolution of the klein paradox @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath14 sets the distance scale at which qft becomes essential for understanding the behavior of a particle of a given rest mass , regardless of how we localize it @xcite .    in summary",
    ", while the de broglie wavelength marks the scale at which non - relativistic quantum effects become important and the classical concept of a particle gives way to the idea of a wave packet , the compton wavelength marks the point at which relativistic quantum effects become significant and the concept of a single wave packet corresponding to a state in which the particle number remains fixed becomes invalid @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 is an effective minimum width because , on smaller scales , the concept of a single quantum mechanical particle breaks down and we must switch to a field description in which particle creation and annihilation occur in place of further spatial localization .",
    "if one assumes that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light , then the momentum of a particle of rest mass @xmath23 is bounded by @xmath31 in newtonian theory .",
    "the uncertainty principle then implies that the particle can not be localised on a scale less than the compton wavelength to within a numerical factor .",
    "more precisely , if @xmath124 , then the relations @xmath125 yield @xmath126 since the momentum of a particle is _ not _ bounded by @xmath31 in relativity , the numerical factor is imprecise .",
    "neveretheless , there are strong theoretical reasons , stemming from detailed calculations in quantum field theory , as well as compelling observational evidence @xcite , for believing that this argument is at least qualitatively correct .    unfortunately , the above derivation is purely heuristic and has no rigorous mathematical foundation .",
    "one problem is that the mass @xmath23 of a particle is a parameter in non - relativistic quantum mechanics and _ not _ an operator , so we can not identify it with either the expectation value @xmath127 or the standard deviation @xmath128 of _ any _ operator @xmath75 . even if identifying @xmath31 with the expectation value of the momentum operator @xmath129 for a given wave packet _ were _",
    "permissible , there is no guarantee that the corresponding standard deviation @xmath98 would be of the same order of magnitude . for example",
    ", it is possible to imagine a wave packet defined by a very narrow peak , centred at @xmath130 , but with spread @xmath131 .",
    "however , from the general formula for @xmath74 we see that @xmath132 , which implies @xmath133 if @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "this may be expected for a wave function that is symmetric , or almost symmetric , about @xmath136 .",
    "one would expect a similar result for ( almost ) spherically symmetric wave packets in any number of dimensions , with @xmath98 being replaced by @xmath137 , and this scenario is considered in detail in sec .",
    "[ sec.3.3 ] .",
    "we wish to place the identifications ( [ ident ] ) on a firmer theoretical footing , so that we may apply the same logic to quantum systems in a higher - dimensional space with compact extra dimensions . this will enable us to derive approximate results for such a scenario _ without _ the need for detailed qft calculations in higher - dimensional spacetimes with compact extra dimensions .      in a non - relativisitic theory ,",
    "the inequality @xmath138 may be obtained by combining the non - relativistic expression for the @xmath12-momentum , @xmath139 with a maximum speed @xmath140 . in conjunction with the de broglie relations , @xmath141 eq .",

    "( [ compton ] ) .",
    "however , since the speed limit is put in by hand , _ without _ introducing additional relativistic effects , such as lorentz invariance , the compton limit ( [ compton ] ) must also be inserted by hand as a lower bound on the de broglie wavelength of the position operator eigenfunctions .",
    "likewise , the constraint ( [ k^2_bound ] ) must be imposed as an upper bound on the wavenumber of momentum operator eigenfunctions .",
    "mathematically , this can be achieved by defining position and momentum operators , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , and their eigenfunctions in the position space representation , in the usual way , @xmath146 and then introducing an infrared cut - off in the expansion for @xmath147 in terms of @xmath148 or for @xmath149 in terms of @xmath150 : @xmath151 these integrals being zero for @xmath152 . in the momentum space representation , @xmath144 and @xmath145 and their eigenfunctions",

    "[ sec.5 ] . under these conditions ,",
    "the uncertainty relation for position and momentum _ does _ allow us to recover the standard expression ( [ compton ] ) .",
    "thus , we have demonstrated that the existence of an effective cut - off for the maximum attainable energy / momentum in non - relativistic quantum mechanics implies the existence of a minimum attainable width for ( almost ) spherically symmetric wave functions , and this may be identified with the compton radius for @xmath124 . for non - spherically symmetric systems we may still consider the ( maximum ) upper bound on each momentum component , @xmath171 , as giving rise to a ( minimum ) lower bound for the spatial extent of the wave packet in @xmath172 spatial direction . as we shall also see in sec .",
    "[ sec.5 ] , this has important implications for the physics of such systems in the presence of compact extra dimensions , and holds for all particles with masses @xmath4 . the argument given above is not the usual justification for the compton wavelength formula in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",

    "but what about the width of the wave packet in the compact directions ?",
    "since we did not design our initial potential to be spherically symmetric in @xmath72 spatial dimensions  having no direct manipulative control over its form in the extra dimensions  it is difficult to imagine that we would suddenly obtain a fully spherically symmetric potential in higher - dimensional space , simply by increasing the energy at which our ` measuring device ' operates .",

    "this makes sense , since it is obvious that , were we able to isolate our measurements of the 3-dimensional part of the wave packet , this would yield only a single length scale @xmath248 ; any ` smearing ' of this measurement due to the spread of the wave packet in the extra dimensions must be due to the @xmath6 additional _ independent _ widths , @xmath328 .    in the most extreme case",

    "this justifies eq .",

    "thus , the problem of defining a single quantum radius for a particle in a semi - compactified higher - dimensional space is analogous to the problem of defining a single radius for asymmetric wave packets in the 3-dimensional case .",
    "quantum states expected to give rise to highly asymmetric wave packets include those corresponding to spinning particles , which should form a pancake in both position and momentum space .",
    "hence , it may be necessary , even in a 3-dimensional context , to modify the standard expression for the compton wavelength for such states to give more than one characteristic length scale ( with differing rest mass dependences ) , corresponding to the widths of the particle in , for example , the directions parallel and perpendicular to the spin axes .",

    "there is still no unambiguous detection of such explosions but it has been claimed that some short - period gamma - ray bursts could be attributed to pbhs @xcite . the second relates to high - energy scattering experments and the enhancement of pair - production at at accelerators on scales below @xmath7 .      in the standard ( @xmath71 ) model ,",
    "pbhs complete their evaporation at the present epoch if they have an initial @xmath389 g and an initial radius @xmath390 cm , comparable to the size of a proton @xcite . for most of their lifetime these pbhs are producing photons with energy @xmath391  mev , so the extragalactic @xmath392-ray background at this energy places strong constraints on the number of such pbhs and thereby their current explosion rate . in principle , these pbhs could also contribute to cosmic - ray positrons and antiprotons , although there are other possible sources of these particles @xcite .",
    "if there are @xmath6 extra dimensions , each with compactification scale @xmath7 , then the mass and temperature of a pbh terminating its evaporation today will change if the critical radius @xmath393 is less than @xmath7 . from eq .",

    "if there is a hierarchy of extra dimensions , the value of @xmath6 in the above equations must be replaced by @xmath397 , which is the dimensionality for which @xmath398 ( @xmath336 ) .",
    "this means that the standard limits on their number density must also be changed , though we do not discuss this further here .",

    "( [ nconstraint ] ) implies @xmath399 cm providing @xmath400 .",
    "this condition is necessarily satisfied in m - theory because the maximum number of compactified dimensions is @xmath401 .",

    ", another uncertainty arises due to the fact that quanta emitted in the compact directions may simply be reabsorbed due to the periodic boundary conditions .",
    "[ mr3 ]      we now consider the consistency of our phenomenologically general results with respect to the leading higher - dimensional theory of fundamental physics : string theory .",

    "@xmath16-particle scattering has been studied in detail by douglas _",

    "however , we have argued that the effective compton scale , defined in terms of minimum positional uncertainty , depends on the form of the wavefunction in the higher - dimensional space . if this is spherically symmetric in the three large dimensions , but maximally asymmetric ( i.e. pancaked ) in the full @xmath72 spatial dimensions , then the effective radius scales as @xmath440 rather than @xmath236 on scales less than @xmath7 and this preserves the symmetry about the @xmath322 line in ( @xmath441 ) space .    in this scenario ,",
    "the effective planck length is reduced but the planck mass is unchanged , so quantum gravity and microscopic black hole production are associated with the standard planck energy , as in the 3-dimensional scenario . on the other hand , one has the interesting prediction that the compton line  which marks the onset of pair - production  is ` lifted ' , relative to the 3-dimensional case , in the range @xmath442 , so that extra - dimensional effects may become visible via enhanced pair - production rates for particles with energies @xmath443 .",
    "this prediction may be consistent with minimum length uncertainty relations obtained from @xmath16-particle scattering amplitudes in string theory . also , as indicated in fig .  4",
    ", the existence of extra compact dimensions has crucial implications for the detectability of black holes evaporating at the present epoch . since these have the size of a proton , they are _ necessarily _ higher - dimensional for @xmath399 cm .",
    "our results naturally suggest a definition for the intrinsic ` quantum ' temperature of a fundamental particle , here referred to as the ` compton temperature ' , which is associated with the spatial localization of a particle s wave packet within a minimum ( i.e. compton ) radius .",
    "this scales as @xmath444 in ( @xmath194)-dimensional spacetime . using the dimensional dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath15",
