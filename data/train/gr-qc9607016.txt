    "<S> although approximation techniques exist @xcite , in general there is no exact solution to the problem of the motion of @xmath1 bodies each interacting under their mutual gravitational influence , except in the case @xmath2 for newtonian gravity , or in @xmath3 dimensions , where the absence of a static gravitational potential allows one to generalize the static 2-body metric to that of two bodies moving with any speed @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we present here an exact solution to problem of the relativistic motion of 2 point masses under gravity in @xmath0 dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the dimensionality necessitates that the gravitational theory we choose is a dilaton theory of gravity ; however our choice of dilatonic gravity is such that the dilaton decouples from the classical equations of motion @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> consequently the motion of the bodies is governed entirely by their mutual gravitational influence , and the spacetime metric is likewise fully determined by their stress - energy @xcite . unlike the @xmath3 dimensional case , a newtonian limit exists , and there is a static gravitational potential . </S>",
    "<S> our solution gives the exact hamiltonian to infinite order in the gravitational coupling constant . </S>",
    "<S> we can thus view the whole structure of the theory from the weak field to the strong field limits .    </S>",

    "<S> it is straightforward to show that the system of field equations reduces to @xmath12 and @xmath13 where the stress - energy due to the point masses is @xmath14 and is conserved . </S>",
    "<S> note that ( [ rtgeo ] ) is a closed system of @xmath15 equations for which one can solve for the single metric degree of freedom and the @xmath1 degrees of freedom of the point masses . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the dilaton field is governed by the evolution of the point - masses via ( [ e4 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is easy to show that the left - hand side of this equation is divergenceless ( consistent with the conservation of @xmath16 ) , yielding only one independent equation to determine the single degree of freedom of the dilaton .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall work in the canonical formalism for which the action ( [ act1 ] ) is written in the form@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are conjugate momenta to @xmath21 and @xmath5 respectively , and @xmath22 with the symbols @xmath23 and @xmath24 denoting @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath27 and @xmath28 are lagrange multipliers which enforce the constraints @xmath29 . since the only linear terms in these constraints are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , we may solve for these quantities in terms of the dynamical and gauge ( _ i.e. _ co - ordinate ) degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> these latter degrees of freedom may be identified by writing the generator ( which arises from the variation of the action at the boundaries ) in terms of the former quantities , and then finding which quantities serve to fix the frame of the physical space - time coordinates in a manner analogous to the @xmath32-dimensional case @xcite .    carrying out this procedure </S>",
    "<S> , we find that we can consistently choose the coordinate conditions @xmath33 and @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> eliminating the constraints , the action ( [ e9 ] ) then reduces to @xmath35 where the reduced hamiltonian for the system of particles is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath38 and is determined by solving the constraint equations which are now @xmath39 @xmath40    an exact solution to these equations in the 2-body case </S>",
    "<S> may now be obtained as follows . </S>",
    "<S> consider first the case @xmath41 , for which we may divide spacetime into three regions : @xmath42 ( ( + ) region ) , @xmath43 ( ( 0 ) region ) and @xmath44 ( ( - ) region ) . </S>",
    "<S> writing @xmath45 and @xmath46 we find in each region that @xmath47 is the sum of growing and decaying exponentials in @xmath48 and that @xmath49 is a sum of terms linear in @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> matching these solutions at the boundaries @xmath50 and @xmath51 of each region allows a determination of the coefficients of the exponentials in the @xmath52 and @xmath53 regions in terms of those in the @xmath54 region .    because the magnitudes of both @xmath47 and @xmath49 increase with increasing @xmath55 , it is necessary to impose a boundary condition which guarantees that the surface terms obtained in passing from ( [ act1 ] ) to ( [ e9 ] ) vanish . </S>",
    "<S> this condition has been shown to be @xmath56 , which must hold in the @xmath52 and @xmath53 regions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> incorporating this into the matching conditions allows one to fully determine the coefficients of the exponentials in the @xmath54 region in terms of the momenta and positions of the point masses .    solving the constraints and the equations for @xmath57 and @xmath58 yields @xmath59{}(+)\\mbox{region } \\\\ </S>",

    "<S> for convenience we have defined the quantities @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> these quantities are related by the equation @xmath70 which determines @xmath71 .    </S>",
    "<S> the parameter @xmath72 is a constant of integration associated with the metric degree of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> we have two types of solutions corresponding to @xmath73 . under time reversal , </S>",
    "<S> these solutions transform into each other , ensuring invariance of the whole theory under this symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show from this solution that the ricci scalar vanishes everywhere except at the locations @xmath74 of the point masses .    </S>",
    "<S> a calcuation shows that the hamiltonian of the system is @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> consequently ( [ eqx ] ) gives an exact solution for the hamiltonian @xmath76 in terms of the co - ordinate and metric degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> it is straightforward to show that the total momenta @xmath77 is conserved , and so we may choose a frame of reference with @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> hamilton s equations then yield @xmath79 as the dynamical equations for the 2-body system coupled to gravity .    repeating this analysis for @xmath80 yields the general equation for the hamiltonian @xmath81{}=(\\sqrt{p^{2}_{1}+m^{2}_{1}}-\\epsilon\\tilde{p}_{1 } ) ( \\sqrt{p^{2}_{2}+m^{2}_{2}}+\\epsilon\\tilde{p}_{2 } ) e^{\\frac{\\kappa}{4}\\left\\{h-\\epsilon(\\tilde{p}_{1}-\\tilde{p}_{2})\\right\\}\\;|r| } \\label{ham}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath82 and @xmath83 .    </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ ham ] ) describes the surface in @xmath84 space of all allowed phase - space trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath76 is a constant of the motion , ( a fact easily verified by differentiation of ( [ ham ] ) with respect to @xmath85 ) a given trajectory in the @xmath86 plane is uniquely determined by setting @xmath87 in ( [ ham ] ) . for @xmath88 </S>",
    "<S> sufficiently small , the trajectory can be regarded as a relativistic perturbation of the newtonian case . </S>",
    "<S> however once @xmath88 is sufficiently large there exist a qualitatively new set of trajectories which can not be understood as relativistically ` correcting ' the newtonian ones . </S>",
    "<S> the transition from the first set to the second set is smooth .    in the equal - mass case , </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian is @xmath89\\right)}{\\kappa|r| } + \\sqrt{{p}^{2}+ m^2 } + \\epsilon p\\ , \\mbox{sgn}(r)\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is the lambert w - function defined via @xmath91 and has two real branches @xcite which join smoothly onto each other . </S>",
    "<S> the principal branch ( for which @xmath92 ) in ( [ eqmass ] ) reduces to the newtonian limit for small @xmath93 ; the second set of trajectories mentioned above are described by the other branch .    </S>",
    "<S> some characteristic phase - space plots for the equal mass case are given in figs . </S>",
    "<S> 12 . </S>",
    "<S> in each of these we have included the corresponding trajectory from the newtonian theory for comparison . </S>",
    "<S> we see that as @xmath88 increases , the trajectory becomes more ` s'-shaped , with the particles reaching their maximum separation for some positive value of @xmath94 , where the velocity @xmath95 . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs because @xmath94 depends upon the momenta of the particles and of the metric . under time - reversal , </S>",
    "<S> the trajectory for a given value of @xmath88 is obtained by reflection in the @xmath96 axis . </S>",
    "<S> fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 shows three phase space plots for the unequal mass case , with the mass of particle 2 being @xmath97 , equal to and twice the mass of particle 1 .    </S>",
    "<S> an interesting limiting case of ( 22 ) may be obtained by setting @xmath98 and @xmath99 . taking the lowest order terms of @xmath100 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain @xmath101 which is just the hamiltonian of a test particle of mass @xmath100 under the influence of a static source at the origin of mass @xmath102 , in which the metric is @xmath103 , @xmath104 @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we hope to extend our analysis of this problem to the many - body problem and to more general theories of dilaton gravity . </S>"
