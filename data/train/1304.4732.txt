    "supernova explosions have a substantial impact on the interstellar environment . supernova remnants ( snrs ) are post - explosion relics , and are formed when shocks from the explosion sweep up and interact with the surrounding medium .",
    "large - scale radio surveys are ideal hunting grounds for new snrs . in the",
    "most frequently used galactic snr catalogue compiled by dave green ( @xcite ) , mainly based on radio continuum observations , there are 274 snrs .",
    "@xcite recently made a new galactic snr catalogue by including new detections from high energy observations .",
    "the number of known galactic snrs is now 312 .",
    "this quantity is still far less than the theoretical predictions ( e.g. @xcite ) , because of two major limitations : the sensitivity and the angular resolution of the observations .",
    "the sino - german @xmath06  cm polarization survey of the galactic plane ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) was conducted between the years 2004 and 2009 , observing the galactic disk in the range of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the angular resolution is 9.5@xmath5 , and the average sensitivity ( 1@xmath6 noise ) of the survey is about 0.8  mk t@xmath7 in total intensity @xmath8 and 0.5  mk t@xmath7 in linear polarization @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "although the angular resolution is coarser in comparison with synthesis telescopes and large single dishes , the system is more suitable for observing snrs with large extent , and the high sensitivity of the sino - german survey enables us to discover snrs as faint as g156.2 + 5.7 , the snr with the lowest surface brightness until recently .",
    "one of the major goals of the @xmath06  cm survey is to study and identify galactic snrs ( see han et al .",
    "2013 , this volume ) . in this talk",
    ", we present the discovery of two new snrs g178.2@xmath14.2 and g25.1@xmath12.3 in our @xmath06  cm survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "considering the limitation in angular resolution , we search for shell - type objects as snr candidate .",
    "shell - type snrs often appear more extended than the crab - like ones , and are easier to identify due to three characteristics : 1 ) shell or partial shell structures , 2 ) associated polarized emission within the shell , and 3 ) the non - thermal spectrum with a spectral index around @xmath11 @xmath12.5 ( s@xmath12 , @xmath13 ) , as expected for adiabatic expansion with a compression factor of 4 .",
    "these are the three criteria for our snr identifications .",
    "note that polarization may not be detected due to faraday depolarization .",

    "it has a circular shape with an apparent diameter of around 1@xmath2 .",
    "a prominent shell is seen in its northern part . the un - related , unresolved double - sided radio source 3c139.2 is near the center of g178.2@xmath14.2 .",
    "polarized emission is seen in the northern shell at both @xmath06  cm and @xmath011  cm .",
    "b - field vectors ( + 90@xmath2 ) are found to be tangential within the shell at @xmath06  cm .",
    "we observed g178.2@xmath14.2 at @xmath011  cm with the effelsberg 100-m telescope in march , 2009 , and we extracted the @xmath021  cm data from the effelsberg @xmath021  cm survey of the galactic plane ( @xcite ) and the effelsberg @xmath021  cm medium latitude survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "the flux density is integrated over the same area of g178.2@xmath14.2 at @xmath06  cm , @xmath011  cm and @xmath021  cm , after removing the contribution from extra - galactic sources and background emission .",
    "we measured @xmath14 = 1.0@xmath150.1  jy , @xmath16 = 1.6@xmath150.2  jy and @xmath17 = 1.8@xmath150.2  jy , yielding an integrated spectral index of @xmath18 ( fig .",

    "the shell structure , the polarized emission and the non - thermal nature strongly indicate that g178.2@xmath14.2 is a snr . from the integrated flux density",
    ", we calculated the surface brightness of the new snr g178.2@xmath14.2 to be @xmath19 . this small value places it among the faintest snrs known in the galaxy .",
    "g25.1@xmath12.3 is found in the inner part of the galaxy .",
    "it is elusive until we filter out the confusion from the strong diffuse galactic emission .",
    "we examined g25.1@xmath12.3 using the data from the urumqi @xmath06  cm survey , the effelsberg @xmath011  cm survey ( @xcite ) and the effelsberg @xmath021  cm survey ( @xcite ) , and found that g25.1@xmath12.3 has only one shell curving to the south .",
    "polarization patches are detected within the shell at @xmath06  cm and @xmath011  cm , but they seem to be un - correlated with g25.1@xmath12.3 ( see fig .  [ g25 ] ) .",
    "we determined that the integrated flux density of g25.1@xmath12.3 is @xmath14 = 3.7@xmath150.4  jy , @xmath16 = 4.7@xmath150.5  jy , and @xmath17 = 6.7@xmath150.7  jy , respectively .",

    "snr g25.1@xmath12.3 has a surface brightness of @xmath21 , which makes it one of the fainter snrs in green s sample ( @xcite , see his fig .  1 ) .    from a possibly associated cavity found in the neutral atomic gas",
    ", we estimate a distance of 3.1  kpc to the new snr g25.1@xmath12.3 .",
    "if this is true , the distance of g25.1@xmath12.3 can explain the absence of polarized emission coming from this object , since polarized emission originated beyond 3  kpc might not be detected at @xmath06  cm in this direction of the galactic plane ( @xcite ) .",
    "based on high angular resolution synthesis observations , @xcite recently identified two other new snrs , g152.4@xmath12.1 and g190.9@xmath12.2 , which are even fainter than g156.2 + 5.7 . the @xmath06  cm total intensity and polarization data from the sino - german @xmath06  cm survey were incorporated in their study and provide strong support and evidence for the identifications .",
