    "it is well - known that under certain moment conditions , with probability one , @xmath9 converges to the semicircle law @xmath10 whose probability density is given by @xmath11.\\ ] ] the semicircle law is in fact the limiting spectral distribution of a very general class of matrices , which are frequently referred to as wigner matrices in the literature .",
    "large dimensional random matrix theory has been rapidly developed ever since the semicircle law was established for the first time .",
    "the two basic classes of matrices , the wigner matrices and sample covariance matrices , have held a basic position in large dimensional random matrix theory .",
    "the investigation of the spectrum of these two classes of matrices have been extensively developed in the literature ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "an interesting fact is that wigner matrices and sample covariance matrices has a connection been set up by the semicircle law .",
    "when the ratio of the dimension and sample size goes to zero , the esd of the normalized sample covariance matrices also converges to the semicircle law .",
    "meanwhile , the semicircle law plays an important role in noncommutative probability and free independence . in the view of the value of research on the wigner matrices to large dimensional random matrix theory , in this paper we consider the asymptotic properties of eigenvectors of large dimensional wigner matrices",
    ".    the earlier work about properties of eigenvectors may refer to @xcite .",
    "when the observation dimension is fixed and low , the author showed the asymptotic distribution for sample covariance eigenvectors when the observations are multivariate normal distributed .",
    "for high dimensional case , johnstone ( 2001 ) @xcite first proposed the spiked model to test the existence of principal component .",
    "further paul ( 2007 ) @xcite investigated the direction of eigenvectors corresponding to spiked eignevalues and showed that the ordinary principal component analysis is necessarily inconsistent when the dimension to sample size ratio is a constant .",
    "the recent work regarding high dimensional principal components can be found in @xcite .",
    "the sparse properties of eigenvectors are also discussed in @xcite .",
    "@xcite characterized the asymptotical haar property of the eigenmatrix ( matrix of eigenvectors ) based on the vesd function ( see the definition below ) .",
    "the delocalization and universality property of eigenvectors can be found in @xcite .",
    "this article is concerned with the eigenvectors of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath12 denote the spectral decomposition of @xmath0 , where @xmath13 with @xmath14 and eigenmatrix @xmath15 is a unitary matrix consisting of the corresponding orthonormal eigenvectors of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath16 , @xmath17 , be an arbitrary unit vector and @xmath18 .",
    "motivated by the fact that the eigenmatrix @xmath19 of gaussian real or complex wigner matrices has haar distribution if the signs of the first row of @xmath19 are i.i.d .",
    "symmetrically distributed , it is conjectured that the eigenmatrix @xmath19 is in a sense close to haar distribution for general large wigner matrices . by adopting the idea of silverstein ,",
    "as demonstrated in @xcite , we define a stochastic process @xmath20 based on @xmath19 by @xmath21}\\left(|y_i|^2-\\dfrac{1}{n}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath22 $ ] denotes the integer not larger than @xmath23 .",
    "if @xmath24 has a haar measure on the topological group of @xmath25-dimensional orthogonal or unitary matrices , then @xmath26 has a uniform distribution over the unit sphere and @xmath20 converges weakly to a brownian bridge by using donsker s theorem .",
    "therefore , the convergence of process @xmath20 to a brownian bridge characterizes the closeness of @xmath19 being haar distributed . for convenience ,",
    "let us consider a transformation from @xmath20 to @xmath27 and define the eigenvector empirical spectral distribution ( vesd ) by @xmath28 then it follows that @xmath29 the recent result @xcite proved that @xmath30 and @xmath31 have the same limiting distribution , the semicircle law , under finite 4th moment condition .",
    "it is believed that the limiting theory of the two processes @xmath20 and @xmath32 are equivalent .",
    "thus the study of @xmath20 is converted to that of difference between the esd @xmath31 and the vesd @xmath30 .",
    "the convergence rate of the esd @xmath31 has been widely investigated in many literatures @xcite , but nothing has been done for the rate of the vesd @xmath30 . this article investigate three types of convergence rate of the vesd function @xmath33 .",
    "we believe that good convergence rate of @xmath34 may help us investigate the behavior of process ( [ f1f ] ) , as reported in @xcite .",
    "besides , the convergence rate of the vesd has its own interest and importance in applications .",
    "it is well known that the optimal bound for the rate of convergence of the expected esd to the semicircle law is of order @xmath35 , as shown in @xcite .",
    "the best possible bound in the gaussian case for the rate of convergence in probability is @xmath36 ( see @xcite ) . even though @xmath31 and @xmath30 both converge to semicircle law , a substantial difference exists between them .",
    "bai and yao @xcite proved that @xmath37 converges to a gaussian distribution for an analytic function @xmath38 . while bai and pan @xcite showed that the limit of @xmath39 is a gaussian distribution . compared with the above two expressions , it is conjectured that the best possible bound for the rate of convergence of the vesd to the semicircle law is of order @xmath2 .",
    "the simulation studies in section [ simulation ] further convince us that the optimal bound for @xmath40 as defined in is @xmath2 .",
    "this is a substantial difference between the esd and the vesd of large dimensional wigner matrices .",
    "the kolmogorov distances between two distribution functions are defined as @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath10 denotes semicircle law .",
    "notice that @xmath43 provides bounds for the rate of convergence in probability .",
    "the main theorems are established as follows ,    [ thm1 ] assume that @xmath44 are i.i.d .",
    "complex random variables with @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 , that @xmath48 are i.i.d . real random variables with @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "further assume that all these random variables are independent .",
    "then , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the distribution function of the semicircular law .",
    "[ thm2 ] under the assumptions in theorem [ thm1 ] except that we now only require @xmath53 , @xmath54 , we have @xmath55    [ thm3 ] under the assumptions in theorem [ thm2 ] , we have @xmath56    we use notation @xmath57 and @xmath58 if , for any @xmath59 , there exist a large constant @xmath60 and a random variable @xmath61 , such that @xmath62 respectively .",
    "as explained before , we believe that theorem [ thm1 ] establishes the optimal bound for @xmath63 , which has a slower convergence rate than the expected esd .",
    "the theoretical reason is as follows .",
    "we can see that from the proof of theorem [ thm1 ] , the bounds for both @xmath63 and the expected esd are derived in terms of their stieltjes transforms ( as defined in ) .",
    "the stieltjes transform of the esd only involves @xmath25 equally - weighted diagonal elements of the resolvent matrix @xmath64 .",
    "while the stieltjes transform of the vesd considers both diagonal and off - diagonal elements with unequal weight .",
    "the number of parameters increases from @xmath25 to @xmath65 , and the weight is changed from equality to inequality .",
    "therefore , it is not surprising that the vesd function @xmath30 has slower optimal convergence rate than the esd @xmath31 .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
