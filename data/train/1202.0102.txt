    "dithering breaks an observation into a sequence of exposures with subpixel pointing offsets to recover nyquist sampling from images that are individually undersampled .",
    "the dithering approach allows having the large field of view from angularly coarse pixels while still allowing robust point - source photometry @xcite and the measurement of subpixel spatial structure of extended objects such as galaxies @xcite .",
    "subdivision of a single pointing into multiple exposures can be done efficiently as long as the short exposures are not dominated by detector read noise , have relatively long exposure times compared with readout time , and do not produce data volumes that exceed data storage and telemetry constraints .",
    "the wfirst mission set forward in the astro2010 report is a satellite experiment that requires accurate measurements of many objects within its field of view .",
    "wfirst measures shapes and colors of many galaxies to detect shear caused by mass inhomogeneities using @xmath1 galaxies per square arcminute .",
    "wfirst measures the time - evolving brightness of stars in dense fields toward the galactic bulge to search for planets , and thousands of type ia supernovae to map the expansion history of the universe .",
    "the fundamental measurement in these latter two cases is the flux of a point source .    in this article",
    "we explore how point - source photometry for an ensemble of sources drives the design and observing strategy of a space - based mission .",
    "the ensemble behavior is of interest because sources are randomly distributed in the sky and are therefore randomly positioned within a pixel ; this is particularly relevant when the pixel is much larger than the psf .",
    "the design parameter of interest is the pixel scale , which can be chosen so that a pixel is smaller , similar , or much larger in size compared with the psf .",
    "the photometric accuracy depends on the number of dither steps and the dither - pointing grid .",
    "although nyquist sampling with a uniform dither pattern is optimal for image reconstruction @xcite , this is not necessarily true for point - source photometry . in situations where a uniform dither pattern is advantageous , we determine the pointing accuracy required to maintain that advantage .",

    ", the underlying host - galaxy structure can be measured to the nyquist frequency using data from all visits .",
    "our treatment operates as if the host - galaxy surface brightness is determined independently and is subtracted from the images of the visit of interest .",
    "similarly , the centroid position of stars and supernovae can be determined from the multiple visits that constitute the light curves .",
    "the position can be considered to be independently known in the analysis of any particular image .",
    "a rigorous treatment simultaneously fits for the position , background , and fluxes of all observations .",

    "this section presents our model for the psf and pixelized data , and demonstrates how psf photometry is performed to estimate flux and position uncertainties from a fit to the data .",
    "extragalactic supernovae are sufficiently small and distant to be considered pointlike ( i.e. , a @xmath2 function ) when its light reaches earth .",
    "the shape of the supernova signal within the detector ( the psf ) is the convolution of the blur contributions from atmospheric scattering , spacecraft jitter , telescope diffraction and wavefront error , and detector diffusion .",
    "furthermore , the detector is pixelized so the measured signals are a discrete sampling of the convolution of the psf and pixel - response function , the effective psf ( epsf or @xmath3 ) . for the space - based mission considered in this article , the main contributions to the psf are the diffraction due to the telescope and the charge diffusion within the detector .",
    "the diffraction for a telescope with an unobscured circular aperture is an airy disk described by the intensity pattern @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bessel function of the first kind of order one and @xmath6 the distance in units of @xmath7 on the chip from the centroid . here",
    "@xmath8 is the telescope focal length , @xmath9 the diameter of the telescope mirror and @xmath10 the wavelength of observation .",
    "detector diffusion of the fully - depleted detectors under consideration is described by a gaussian profile @xmath11 with width , @xmath12 .",
    "( in our formalism , the charge diffusion term can represent all sources of gaussian blur . )",
    "the epsf accounts for the pixelization by convolving the psf with the pixel - response function as predetermined by calibration . in our calculations",
    "we take the pixel response to be a two - dimensional boxcar function @xmath13 , although , in general , the response could have intrapixel variation .",
    "the epsf is @xmath14 .",
    "we assume that the epsf is derived from field objects and extensive pre- and in - flight calibration and contributes negligible statistical uncertainty to the psf photometry .",
    "this translates into an experimental requirement for the amount of calibration data needed to model the epsf : a challenging but feasible task considering the stability of the space platform and the surface density of point sources on each image .",
    "the epsf calibration includes contributions from possible intrapixel variation .",

    "we consider cases where the centroid position is independently known or must also be derived from the fit to the data .",
    "the flux and epsf are assumed to not evolve in the short interval that the dither sequence is performed , although it can generally vary from exposure to exposure .",
    "the most probable values for the vector @xmath33 are found by maximizing the likelihood or minimizing @xmath34 when the noise is gaussian .",
    "working from the fisher information matrix ( fim ) formalism it can be shown that @xmath35 ; a calculation of the fisher elements may give precise information of how well parameter @xmath36 is estimated . in general",
    "the fim takes the form @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a vector with the observables , @xmath39 is the corresponding covariance matrix , and @xmath40 is parameter @xmath36 . when the noise is not dependent on the parameters we fit for ,",
    "the second term is simply zero .",

    "poisson statistics are applied in the calculation of the likelihood .",
    "we confirm that in this extreme case the confidence regions for the three permutations of the @xmath21 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 parameters are close to elliptical and that our gaussian assumptions are reasonable .",
    "we now turn our attention to the photometric uncertainties of the ensemble of point sources randomly distributed on the pixel grid .",
    "this is of interest to multiplexed surveys where multiple objects lie within the imager field of view .",
    "as seen in the previous section , psf - fit parameter uncertainties of a single source depend on the supergrid ( the interlaced pixel grids of all the pointings ) and the source centroid position relative to the grid .",
    "averaging over randomly positioned sources , the difference in parameter estimation can only be due to differing dither patterns and number of dithers .",
    "our interest is to determine which pixel scales and dither patterns work well for the set of objects as a whole rather than for an individual object .",
    "the statistics we consider are the mean and standard deviations of the parameter uncertainties .",
    "clearly low mean uncertainties are beneficial for any survey .",
    "however , the importance of the standard deviation depends on the science and the survey strategy .",
    "multiepoch observations of quiescent objects can be analyzed with all the dithers of all visits .",
    "a large standard deviation produces large variations in uncertainty between objects and between different epochs of the same object .",
    "the realized uncertainty depends on the subpixel position of the object meaning that there is a nontrivial efficiency window - function over the sky .",
    "the standard deviation must be accounted for in calculating the multiplex efficiency of observing multiple objects in a pointing .",
    "this is particularly important for time - variable objects ; for example the fit for distance can depend strongly on which visits happen to have extremely inaccurate measurements .",
    "this section is organized as follows : we first introduce the hardware setups and dither patterns considered in the analysis , simulation details , notation , and units .",
    "first - order results are derived from analytical expressions for the fisher elements in equation  [ eq:10 ] .",
    "we then show numerical results from simulations where we scan over pixel sizes and detector diffusions for different dither patterns .",
    "we calculate distributions of photometric uncertainties for a range of dither strategies , hardware properties , and priors on the position of the source of interest .",
    "the dithering strategies include @xmath49 and @xmath50 dither pointings ( labeled by d2 and d3 ) each with three different patterns .",
    "one pattern has completely random pointings ( random dithering labeled with the subscript r ) , the second uses precise dither steps to give a uniformly spaced supergrid ( perfect dithering labeled with the subscript p ) , the third attempts perfect dithering but with a random gaussian pointing uncertainty ( gaussian dithering labeled with the subscript g ) .",
    "hardware scenarios cover pixel scales @xmath20 ranging between @xmath51 and @xmath52 and detector diffusions @xmath12 ranging between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , both in 0.2 steps in units of the diffraction scale @xmath55 .",
    "these ranges include scenarios where the epsf is dominated by an airy disk , gaussian , and top - hat functions .",
    "the flux uncertainty of a single observation is expressed as @xmath56 ; position uncertainties affect the final flux uncertainty as @xmath57 is not diagonal .",
    "cases where the source position is known independently are given by @xmath58 .",
    "fitting for the flux yields different uncertainties compared with when both flux and position are fit .",
    "the square root of the area of the @xmath26@xmath27 error ellipse , as we here denote @xmath59 , is used to represent the centroid position uncertainty . in terms of the fisher matrix , @xmath59",
    "is then given as the fourth root of the determinant of the @xmath26@xmath27 submatrix of the full covariance matrix @xmath60 .",
    "uncertainty results are given relative to that of the hardware choice of @xmath61 , @xmath62 , where diffraction , diffusion , and pixel response have similar contributions to the epsf .",
    "as described in the introduction to the section , we are interested in the average performance from a given dither pattern and pixel scale , rather than from a particular pointing .",
    "the distribution from which we can find characteristics like the average and variance is found by generating @xmath63 random realizations for the initial pointing for each choice of pixel scale , diffusion , and dithering strategy . to simplify the notation",

    "the results help clarify some of the general features in the simulation plots presented in the next section .",
    "the first - order results are defined to describe @xmath70 in the limit where the variance of the terms in equation  [ eq:10 ] is small . in that limit @xmath70",
    "can be well approximated by @xmath71 , reducing the problem to a calculation of @xmath72 , which turns out to have a relative simple analytical form .",

    "we now discuss first - order scalings of fit uncertainties in different noise limits .",
    "writing out the noise terms in equations  [ eq:30 ] and [ eq:40 ] shows that @xmath79 and @xmath80 in the sky- and source - noise limits are both independent of the number of dithers .",
    "furthermore , the term @xmath81 in the source - noise limit ( @xmath82 ) is independent of the shape of @xmath3 : i.e. ,  @xmath83 , @xmath12 , and @xmath20 .",
    "in general , the integrals in equations  [ eq:30 ] and [ eq:40 ] must be calculated numerically , but analytic results exist in some limits .",

    "intuitively , such a degradation in the position determination is expected , since centroid information within a single image is lost when the source signal lands in only one pixel .",

    "in  [ randomvperfect : sec ] , it was shown that a perfect dither pattern outperforms a random pattern in certain configurations .",

    "we explore how @xmath148 degrades perfect dithering up to the point where pointing error is comparable with the pixel size and the dither grid effectively becomes random . despite the pointing error , the realized pointings are assumed to be well determined from astrometric calibration .",
    "there are at least two ways to model telescope pointing errors .",
    "the first is to have independent errors for each pointing .",
