    "supersymmetry ( susy ) has its origins in quantum field theory .",
    "it is usually associated with high energy physics , especially with sugra , where the fermionic fields correspond to physical quantities , the mathematical incarnation of a ( as yet , hypothetical ) fundamental phenomenon . however , beyond this fascinating and deep theory , and its independent mathematical interest , susy also has applications in quite different areas of physics , notably , in condensed matter .    here , the generators of supersymmetry do not correspond to physical quantities .",
    "rather , they appear as effective symmetries of models for low - temperature limits of the fundamental quantum field theory .",
    "this idea goes under the name of the _ supersymmetry method _ , and was developed , by efetov and wegner @xcite .",
    "its particular merit is the possibility to derive , by the use of harmonic analysis on certain symmetric superspaces , precise closed form expressions for statistical quantities  such as the moments of the conductance of a metal with impurities @xcite  in a regime where the system becomes critical , for instance , exhibiting a transition from localisation to diffusion , which is not tractable by other methods .    in connection with the physics of thin wires ,",
    "the subject was well studied in the 1990s ; it has recently gained substantial new interest , since the ` symmetry classes ' investigated in this context @xcite have been found to occur as ` edge modes ' of certain 2d systems dubbed ` topological insulators ' ( resp .",
    "superconductors ) @xcite .",
    "mathematically , several aspects of the method beg justification .",
    "one both subtle and salient point is the transformation of certain integrals over flat superspace in high dimension @xmath0 , which occur as expressions for statistical green s functions , into integrals over a curved superspace of fixed rank and dimension  the latter being more amenable to asymptotic analysis ( by steepest descent or stationary phase ) .",
    "traditionally , this step is performed by the use of the so - called hubbard ",
    "stratonovich transformation , which is based on a careful deformation of the integration contour .",
    "this poses severe analytical problems , which to the present day have only been overcome in cases derived from random matrix ensembles that follow the normal distribution @xcite . to extend the supersymmetry method s range beyond gaussian disorder , for instance to establish universality for invariant random matrix ensembles , a complementary tool was introduced , based on ideas of fyodorov @xcite : the _ superbosonisation identity _ proved by littelmann ",
    "sommers  zirnbauer in their seminal paper @xcite .",
    "we now proceed to describe this identity . in general , it holds in the context of unitary , orthogonal , and unitary - symplectic symmetry .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the first case ( of unitary symmetry ) , although our methods carry over to the other cases .",
    "one considers the space @xmath1 of square super - matrices and a certain subsupermanifold @xmath2 of purely even codimension , whose underlying ( riemannian symmetric ) manifold @xmath3 is the product of the positive hermitian @xmath4 matrices with the unitary @xmath5 matrices . let @xmath6 be a superfunction defined and holomorphic on the tube domain based on @xmath7 .",
    "the superbosonisation identity states @xmath8 for some finite positive constant @xmath9 , provided @xmath6 has sufficient decay at infinity along the manifold @xmath3 .",
    "here , @xmath10 is the quadratic map @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the flat berezinian density , and @xmath13 is a berezinian density on @xmath2 , invariant under a certain natural transitive supergroup action we will specify below .",
    "remark that any @xmath14-invariant superfunction on @xmath15 may be written in the form @xmath16",
    ". a notable feature of the formula is thus that it puts the ` hidden supersymmetries ' ( from @xmath17 ) into evidence through the invariant integral over the homogeneous superspace @xmath2 , where ` manifest symmetries ' ( from @xmath14 ) enter _ via _  some character ( namely , @xmath18 ) .",
    "a remarkable special case occurs when @xmath19 .",
    "then equation reduces to @xmath20 which is known as the _ bosonisation identity _ in physics .",
    "notice that the left - hand side is a purely fermionic berezin integral , whereas the right - hand side is purely bosonic .",
    "formally , it turns fermions @xmath21 into bosons @xmath22 .",
    "if in addition @xmath23 , we obtain the _ cauchy integral formula_.    at the other extreme , if @xmath24 , then @xmath25 , and equation is a classical identity due to ingham and siegel @xcite , well - known to harmonic analysts .",
    "it admits a far - reaching generalisation in the framework of euclidean jordan algebras @xcite .",
    "the first one to use it in the physics context that inspired superbosonisation was fyodorov @xcite .",
    "moreover , the right - hand side of the identity , _ viz . _  @xmath26 is the so - called ( unweighted ) _ riesz distribution_. after suitable renormalisation , it becomes analytic in the parameter @xmath27 , a fact that was exploited in the analytic continuation of holomorphic discrete series representations by rossi",
    " vergne @xcite .",
    "see also ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this observation links the identity to equivariant geometry and lie theoretic representation theory , and this was our motivation to re - investigate the identity .    in this survey , we explain two new proofs of the superbosonisation identity , which exploit these newly found connections .",
    "one of these proofs is based on representation theory .",
    "namely , as it turns out , the two sides of the identity are given by certain special relatively invariant functionals on two highest weight modules of the lie superalgebra @xmath28 , which are infinite dimensional for @xmath29 .",
    "their equality is an immediate consequence of a multiplicity one statement .",
    "we will explain the main ingredients of the proof ; details shall be published elsewhere .    on the other hand , to actually identify the r.h.s .  as a functional on the corresponding representation requires the construction of an intertwining operator in the form of a certain weighted laplace transform @xmath30 .",
    "this leads to another proof , based on comparing laplace transforms .",
    "the functional analytic details of this proof can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we only explain the main ideas .",
    "combining both points leads to further developments .",
    "indeed , the representations related to the superbosonisation identity depend on a parameter @xmath31 . using functional equations",
    ", one may show that the r.h.s .",
    "is analytic as a distribution - valued function of @xmath27 . in a forthcoming paper",
