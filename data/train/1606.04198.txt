    "the deployment of a cloud - based radio access network ( cran ) is expected to be an integral part of 5 g networks @xcite . in cran ,",
    "remote radio heads ( rrhs ) , which are small radio antennas responsible for transmission , cooperate to serve their wireless users . to achieve such coordination ,",
    "the rrhs are connected through a fronthaul link to a control unit ( cu ) that performs efficient signal processing .",
    "however , in cran , the fronthaul links are often of finite capacity @xcite , and thus , the number of rrhs connected to the cu will be limited .",
    "thus , the cran will need to co - exist with the small cell base stations ( bss ) of an existing heterogeneous cellular network ( hetnet ) .",
    "in particular , in the downlink , the presence of a large number of rrhs can increase the interference on hetnet users .",
    "thus , it is imperative to devise new solutions for optimized interference management in such a hybrid cran - hetnet architecture @xcite .    in the existing literature ,",
    "the problem of downlink interference mitigation has been considered mainly within the context of hetnets @xcite .",
    "the objective is to reduce to the interference caused by the high - powered macro bss on the low - powered femto and pico bss .",
    "these techniques range from power control @xcite to the allocation of frequency and time resources such as in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recent works such as in @xcite considered interference mitigation for a cran using mimo techniques .",
    "the authors in @xcite studied the challenge of limited fronthaul capacity in cran , and derived the optimal power allocations that maximize the system s sum - rates under a constrained fronthaul . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors proposed a centralized resource allocation technique for the downlink of a cran coexisting with a macro bs .",
    "however , this existing body of work is either focused on cran or hetnets , in isolation , or in a very restricted setting .",
    "thus , none of these works addresses the problem of interference management in hybrid cran / small cell architectures .    the main contribution of this paper is to introduce a novel framework for power control and interference management that can ensure an efficient hetnet and cran co - existence .",
    "we formulate the problem as a noncooperative game between the cran and hetnet s bss . in this game , each base station seeks to choose its optimal power allocation to maximize the sum - rate of its users .",
    "given the heterogeneity of the system , we cast the game within the framework of _ cognitive hierarchy theory _",
    "@xcite in which players can be organized into multi - tier hierarchies depending on their capabilities , unlike in classical stackelberg games that allow only for a two level pre - determined hierarchy @xcite . for our model , the hierarchy pertains to the fact that computationally capable and high - powered bss , such as the cran or the macrocell bss can have a higher hierarchy in the network than smaller bss , such as femtocells .",
    "such a hierarchical organization eventually allows reducing the interference on low - powered bss as they no longer need to consider the actions of the devices with higher power capabilities .",
    "in contrast , by being at the top of the hierarchy , high - powered bss such as the cran and macrocell bss will be more conservative in their power control decisions .",
    "for both the conventional game and the cognitive hierarchy game , we characterize the equilibrium solutions and study their properties .",
    "simulation results show that the proposed cognitive hierarchy model yields a two - fold improvement in the total system rate , when compared with a classical game - theoretic model .",
    "the results also show considerable interference reduction on the low - powered bss .    the paper is organized as follows : section ii presents the system model and the power allocation problem .",
    "section iii presents the game theoretic formulation of the problem as well as the nash equilibrium and the cognitive hierarchy solutions respectively .",
    "section iv presents the simulation results .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn in section v.",
    "consider the downlink of a cran composed of a set @xmath0 of remote radio heads ( rrh ) serving cooperatively a set @xmath1 of users .",
    "all rrhs are connected to a central cloud - based control unit ( cu ) via finite capacity fronthaul link .",
    "the cu is responsible for the resource allocation and the signal processing of the rrhs , while the rrhs are responsible only for data transmission .    due to the finite capacity of the fronthaul",
    ", there is a maximum number of rrhs that could be connected to the cu . hence , the cran must co - exist with a hetnet composed of a set @xmath2 of macro bss , a set @xmath3 of pico bss , and a set @xmath4 femto bss .",
    "each bs @xmath5 @xmath6 has a set @xmath7 of users to serve .",
    "each user @xmath8 is located at a distance @xmath9 from bs @xmath10 or from rrh @xmath11 .",
    "ofdma transmissions of @xmath12 subcarriers are also assumed at each bs in @xmath13 and rrh in the cran .",
    "the channel gain @xmath14 between each bs / rrh @xmath5 and user @xmath15 over subcarrier @xmath16 is distributed according to an independent rayleigh fading .",
    "the received power of a user @xmath15 over subcarrier @xmath16 is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the path loss exponent and @xmath19 is the transmission power of bs / rrh @xmath5 over subcarrier @xmath16 .",
    "additive white gaussian noise of variance @xmath20 is present at each receiver . in our model , each bs / rrh @xmath5 can transmit with a maximum power @xmath21 , and each mobile user has a single receive antenna .    in the cran ,",
    "the cu assigns subcarrier @xmath16 to a single user in @xmath1 and all rrhs transmit simultaneously to that user .",
    "the cu uses beamforming to coordinate the transmissions of the rrhs over subcarrier @xmath16 .",
    "thus , the received rate of user @xmath22 over subcarrier @xmath16 is given by the multiple input single output capacity with power constraint on each antenna as in @xcite:@xmath23where @xmath24 is the vector of power allocations of all rrhs over subcarrier @xmath16 and @xmath25 is the transmission bandwidth .",
    "it has been shown in @xcite that the optimal signaling to achieve this capacity is to use beamforming weight vector @xmath26 where each entry @xmath27 is the weight of rrh @xmath5 and is given by : @xmath28based on this transmission scheme and the rate equation in ( [ ratecloud ] ) , and in order to ensure fairness , the cu assigns subcarrier @xmath16 to user @xmath29 such that : @xmath30assuming that transmissions occur within time frames and @xmath31 is the average rate over the previous time slots .",
    "since each bs assigns each subcarrier to one of its users , hereinafter , we drop the user index @xmath15 for brevity .",
    "the cu finds the optimal power allocations @xmath32 for all rrhs that maximize the sum of rates over @xmath12 subcarriers : @xmath33 as for the bss in @xmath13 , the received rate at each user @xmath15 in @xmath7 from bs @xmath5 transmission will be : @xmath34 based on ( [ bsrate ] ) , bs @xmath5 allocates subcarrier @xmath16 to user @xmath35 in @xmath7 such that : @xmath36 each bs @xmath5 is required to find its transmission powers @xmath19 so that the sum of rates over all subcarriers is maximized:@xmath37 the bss in the hetnet operate independently of each other and of the cran .",
    "hence , the cu and the bss must find their optimal transmission powers in a distributed manner .",
    "however , the rrhs and the bss will mutually interfere which , in turn , affects their users received rates .",
    "this motivates the adoption of a game - theoretic approach , as explained next .",
    "this problem is formulated as a static noncooperative game defined by the triplet @xmath38 where the @xmath39 is the set of players .",
    "the strategy vector @xmath40 of each player @xmath5 is to choose its transmission power values over all the subcarriers .",
    "hence , the strategy set for bs @xmath5 in @xmath13 is : @xmath41^{l } \\hspace{0.1 cm } \\textrm{s.t . }",
    "\\hspace{0.1 cm } \\sum_{k=1}^lp_{ik}=p_{i,\\textrm{max } } \\}$ ] , and the strategy set for the cu in the cran is @xmath42 \\hspace{0.1 cm } \\textrm{s.t . } \\hspace{0.1 cm } \\sum_{k=1}^lp_{ik}=p_{i,\\textrm{max } } \\forall i \\in \\mathcal{k}_c\\}$ ] .",
    "the utility for each bs @xmath5 will be : @xmath43where @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the distance between bs @xmath5 and the user assigned to subcarrier @xmath16 .",
    "similarly , the cu s utility is : @xmath46      the conventional solution for this formulated game is the so - called nash equilibrium @xcite . in particular , a strategy profile @xmath47 is said to constitute a nash equilibrium ( ne ) if : @xmath48where @xmath49 is the vector of strategies of all players except @xmath5 . to derive the ne for this game , we first determine the best response strategy for each player @xmath50 . for each bs @xmath10 ,",
    "the best response is the well known water - filling solution @xcite .    _ given a fixed power policy @xmath49 , the optimal strategy ( best response ) of bs @xmath5 is given by : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is given by : @xmath53 and @xmath54 satisfies : @xmath55_.    this follows from the fact that utility function is concave in @xmath40 since it is a sum of log functions such that each term is a log function of @xmath19 ( for @xmath56 ) . also , the constraint function of @xmath19 in ( [ bsopt ] ) is a linear function of @xmath19 ( for @xmath56 ) .",
    "thus , the optimal solution is found using the kkt conditions .    _",
    "the best response of the cu is the solution of the nonlinear equations : @xmath57 where @xmath52 and @xmath58 are given by respectively : _",
    "@xmath59    @xmath60 .",
    "we first show that @xmath61 is concave in the variables @xmath19 ( @xmath62 ) by showing that the function @xmath63 is concave .",
    "this function can be written as:@xmath64 in the above equation , the first sum is a linear sum of @xmath19 for @xmath65 .",
    "also , each term of the second sum can be easily seen to be concave in @xmath19 and @xmath66 since in general the function @xmath67 is concave in @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "thus , the function @xmath63 is a sum of concave functions in @xmath19 for @xmath65 and is therefore concave .",
    "also in general , the function @xmath70 is increasing concave function of @xmath68 .",
    "thus , the function @xmath61 is an increasing concave function of @xmath63 .",
    "thus , it is concave using the general property that a monotonic concave transformation of a concave function is concave .",
    "it follows that the utility function of the cu in ( [ ucloud ] ) is also concave since it is the sum of concave functions in @xmath19 , @xmath65 .",
    "thus , the optimal solution can be found using kkt conditions .",
    "the existence of the ne is presented next .",
    "_ there exists at least one pure nash equilibrium for the heterogeneous cloud power allocation game . _",
    "this follows directly from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 20.3 ) .    at the ne , the cu or each bs considers the strategies made by all other devices when choosing its own strategy .",
    "this can be detrimental to low - powered bss who will need to respond to a high level of interference caused by the cran and macro bss , and hence , will choose a more conservative power allocation . to overcome this challenge",
    ", we will next develop a new game - theoretic model based on _ cognitive hierarchy theory _ @xcite .      under cognitive hierarchy ( ch )",
    ", devices are organized into a hierarchy such that the cran and macro bss are placed at the higher hierarchy levels , while low - powered bss are placed at the lower hierarchy levels .",
    "each player assumes that the other players belong to equal or lower hierarchy levels when selecting its strategy .",
    "this allows low - powered bss to choose less conservative actions than in a conventional ne .",
    "we adopt the poisson ch model in @xcite with the following considerations .",
    "first , players are distributed across hierarchy levels according to a poisson distribution @xmath71 of rate @xmath72 . moreover",
    ", a player at level @xmath16 knows the true distributions of players which are at lower levels .",
    "this is known as the overconfidence assumption and it is a realistic assumption for cases in which players are humans for example . using hierarchical approaches for power allocation in hetnets",
    "has been earlier investigated using stackelberg games @xcite .",
    "stackelberg games , however , rely on only a two level hierarchy composed of leaders and followers , while ch allows for multiple levels of hierarchy , which is more suitable to our setting .",
    "further , in stackelberg games , both leaders and followers consider the actions of each others when choosing their actions .",
    "this may not be very effective for reducing interference on low - powered bss .    in the hetnet tier ,",
    "the maximum transmit power of a bs is dependent on its type .",
    "for instance , a larger bs has a higher maximum transmit power , and thus , it can cause higher interference on smaller bss . to mitigate this high interference , we group the bss based on their type , using the ch level approach .",
    "in particular , femtocell bss , who have the lowest power , are assumed to belong to level 1 while pico bss belong to level 2 , macro bss belong to level 3 , and the cran belongs to the last level . in order to reduce the interference among bss of the same type , the overconfidence assumption of the poisson ch model",
    "is modified so that bss consider the actions of bss of the same type . however , in ch , each bs takes its action based on its beliefs and does not learn the power values of the bss of the same type .",
    "thus , we assume that each player at level @xmath16 believes that all other players of the same type act using the same strategy .",

    "it is given by : @xmath79 .",
    "for the cran , we assume that the cu is aware that there are no other players at the same level .",
    "this can be achieved by selecting a proper value of the poisson distribution parameter @xmath72 that satisfies @xmath80 in the ch model .",

    "@xmath93    @xmath94    the utility of the cu in the ch case is still the same function of @xmath19 as in ( [ ucloud ] ) .",

    "the improvement in the total system rate is on the average double the total sum - rate of the ne and the equal power policy .",
    "[ rrhpowtotal ] further corroborates such rate improvements at all rrh transmit power values .",
    "clearly , the proposed ch power allocation approach improves considerably the performance of the low - powered ( pico and femto ) bss without degrading the performance of the cran and the macro bss .",
