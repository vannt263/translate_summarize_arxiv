    "the weyl singularity is generally absent although the energy of the abs can pass zero .",
    "the authors obtain a condition for zero energy abs and study the density of states in detail .",
    "when so interaction is present , the energy levels of the abs are split in spin .    in this study , we investigate theoretically the singularities of the abs spectrum in four - terminal josephson junction taking so interaction into account .",
    "we thus attempt to formulate the full picture of such singularities combining phenomenological and analytical methods and illustrating it with numerical results .",
    "the abs energies are found from the beenakker s determinant equation  @xcite using the scattering matrix of the junction .",
    "mostly we concentrate on the case of short junction where we can disregard the energy dependence of scattering matrix .",
    "sometimes the absence of energy dependence leads to extra degeneracy in the spectrum . to lift those we take into account the energy dependence by perturbation theory .",

    "we consider the behavior of the singularities upon gradual increase of the strength of so interaction .",
    "we have found that so interaction splits the spectrum of abs in spin . very much like zeeman effect would do .",

    "the weyl singularities thus remain topologically protected .",
    "a small modification of scattering matrix by a parameter changes the position of the mirror symmetric conical points , not eliminating them .",
    "as we show in numerical illustration , an annihilation of weyl points of opposite charge can take place upon the tuning of the scattering matrix .",
    "we derive the effective hamiltonian describing the vicinity of the weyl points .",
    "the cones in the vicinity intersect @xmath14 at a 2d surface in a 3d space of the phases .",
    "we prove that this is the general property of abs spectrum in the presence of so interaction .",
    "singularities of a different type arise when abs energies approaches the gap edge , @xmath15 . owing to mirror symmetry of andreev spectrum",

    "we formulate a mathematical analogy that permits to map weyl singularities at @xmath14 in the presence ( absence ) of the so interaction to singularities at @xmath15 in the absence ( presence ) of the so interaction .",
    "since the abs energies in the presence of so interaction reach zero energy at 2d surface , we expect the gap touching point to form 2d surfaces in the absence of so interaction .",
    "indeed this can be seen in a concrete numerical calculation . employing the same analogy from the fact that without so interaction the abs energies reach zero at isolated point",
    "only , we derive that the gap edge touching ( get ) in the presence of so interaction generally occurs only at the isolated point .",
    "this implies that even a weak so interaction removes the get .",
    "we construct the effective hamiltonian to describe this situation . in this case , a weak energy dependence of scattering matrix can also become important . an important peculiarity of the abs spectrum concerns the vicinity of symmetry lines in 3d elementary cell of the space of the phases .",
    "three of the four superconducting phases are the same at a symmetry line .",
    "therefore the four - terminal junction at a symmetry line can be regarded as a two - terminal junction with unequal number of conduction channels in the two leads . as mentioned in ref .",
    ", for two - terminal short junction , the so interaction is irrelevant to causing spin splitting",
    ". thus the vicinity of symmetry lines requires a separate consideration .",
    "we derive an effective hamiltonian to incorporate the details of the get in the vicinity of the symmetry lines .",
    "these two types of singular point would reveal the topological nature of multi - terminal josephson junctions .",
    "it brings a goal to propose nanostructures as artificial exotic materials .",

    "the scattering matrix @xmath48 commutes with @xmath49 .",

    "however , we do not find the isolated get point in our numerical simulations .    at a symmetry line ,",
    "since three of the four phases are equal , the four - terminal junction can be regarded as a two - terminal junction with unequal channel numbers in the leads .",
    "then , only a single abs is sensitive to the phase differences while the other stick to the gap edge .",
    "we have also derived an effective hamiltonian in the vicinity of the symmetry lines .",
    "the energy - dependence of the scattering matrix lifts the get and adds another andreev state , which is localized in the vicinity of the symmetry line .",
    "our study provides a numerical and analytical evidence for the weyl points in multi - terminal josephson junctions .",
    "these points are different from weyl singular points from that predicted and recently found in 3d solids , such as taas  @xcite , tap  @xcite , and nbas  @xcite . in the 3d solids , the absence of inversion symmetry in the material and removing the spin degeneracy are essential for a stable weyl point .",
    "however , multi - terminal josephson junction shows stable weyl points even though the abs energies are not spin - split .",
    "our study thus facilitates an alternative method of realization of weyl fermions in condensed matter .",
    "the weyl points in multi - terminal josephson junction should provide positive and negative topological charges in the space of the phases .",
    "the charges are sources of the berry curvature fields .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed an experimental setup to detect the chern number by measuring the quantized transconductance , in similarity with the quantum hall effect . in their scheme ,",
    "the chern number is defined as the integral of the berry curvature field on a 2d plane in the space .",
    "physically , the integration is achieved by sweeping the phases by applying finite bias voltages to the superconducting leads .",
    "riwar et al .",
    "considered a situation without so interaction where the weyl singular points appear always at e=0 and are doubly degenerate with respect to spin .",
    "then the lowest positive ( and the highest negative ) levels of the abs are relevant to the chern number . near the weyl point",
    ", the quantization of transconductance may be sensitive to the temperature of the junction owing to the undesired thermal activation of a quasiparticle in the lowest subband . in this paper , we take into account the so interaction and consider weyl singularities of two types . although the so interaction shifts the conical point from e=0 , it does not influence the chern number arising from the singularity .",
    "therefore , the topological charge may be still detected by measuring the quantized transconductance .",
    "the same applies to the singularity at the gap edge .",
    "the so shift of the singular point from the fermi energy implies that the probability of undesired thermal activation of a quasiparticle state near the point of the singularity is small at sufficiently low temperatures , this facilitates the observation of the topological effect .",

    "<S> we investigate the singularities and peculiarities of the resulting abs spectrum combining phenomenological and analytical methods and illustrating with the numerical results . </S>",
    "<S> we pay special attention on spin - orbit ( so ) effects . </S>",
    "<S> we consider weyl singularities with a conical spectrum that are situated at zero energy in the absence of so interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the so interaction splits the spectrum in spin like a zeeman field would do . </S>",
    "<S> the singularity is preserved while departed from zero energy . with so interaction , points of zero - energy form </S>",
    "<S> an @xmath3 dimensional manifold in @xmath1 dimensional space of phases , while this dimension is @xmath4 in the absence of so interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the singularities of other type are situated near the superconducting gap edge . in the absence ( presence ) of so interaction , the abs spectrum at the gap edge </S>",
    "<S> is mathematically analogues to that at zero energy in the presence ( absence ) of so interaction . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that the gap edge touching ( get ) points of the spectrum in principle form @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) dimensional manifold when the so interaction is absent ( present ) . certain symmetry lines in the brillouin zone of the phases </S>",
    "<S> are exceptional from this rule , and get there should be considered separately . </S>",
    "<S> we derive and study the effective hamiltonians for all the singularities under consideration . </S>"
