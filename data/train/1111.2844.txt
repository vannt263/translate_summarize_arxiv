    "the magellanic clouds play a fundamental role in astrophysics because they are the closest laboratory we have to probe the extragalactic distance scale and the theories about chemical evolution of stars and galaxies .",
    "they are close enough to be able to identify individual objects and isolate them from their environment . in the case of chemical abundance studies of h@xmath1  regions ,",
    "it is possible to perform observations that avoid bright stars , wolf - rayet stars , and supernova remnants ; this can translate in extremely good equivalent widths in emission , ew@xmath4(h@xmath5)@xmath6250  .",
    "there have been many studies of the chemical composition of h@xmath1  regions  in the magellanic clouds ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it has been found that the chemical composition within each cloud is uniform , and that the smc has lower metallicity ( approximately 0.40 dex ) than the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) ; making the smc the best object to study low metallicity environments .",
    "in particular , h@xmath1  regions  of the smc provide the means to study low metallicity star - forming neighborhoods and ngc 456 is one of the brightest regions of the smc @xcite . in this study the number of lines presented for ngc 456 and ngc 460 is considerably larger than in previous works .",
    "almost all studies of h@xmath1  regions  use the direct method to determine gaseous abundances , and implicitly assume that this value represents the chemical abundances of the ism .",
    "the direct method uses collisionally excited lines ( cels ) to obtain chemical abundances , and presuppose a homogeneous temperature structure .",
    "when abundances are calculated using recombination lines ( rls ) , they are approximately factors of 2 higher than abundances obtained with cels ; this is now known as the abundance discrepancy factor ( adf ) problem . moreover ,",
    "the depletion into dust grains can account for a large fraction of the oxygen atoms .",
    "@xcite measured the depletion into dust in the orion nebula and suggested that a 0.08 dex correction to the o / h ratio should be included when considering h@xmath1  regions .",
    "more recent studies of the orion nebula suggest that the correction is higher @xcite while recent studies of depletion of mg , si , and fe suggest that the correction depends on the o / h ratio of the specific h@xmath1  region  @xcite , reaching a fraction of up to 28%  for high metallicity regions .",
    "@xcite proposed to take into account @xmath0  when using cels to determine abundances in modeling h@xmath1  regions , and found that spatial thermal fluctuations of approximately 20%  are capable of producing errors of factors of 2 to 3 on the determination of chemical abundances .",
    "the additional complications to calculate abundances using @xmath0 , along with the fact that there is no tailored physical model to fit temperature inhomogeneities , have made its reception within the community poor .    since the idea of peimbert s temperature inhomogeneities was introduced , several explanations about where such temperature inhomogeneities could be coming from have been proposed : shock waves , shadowed regions , advancing ionization fronts , multiple ionizing sources , x - rays , magnetic reconnection , and inhomogeneous chemical composition , among others ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . however , most of these explanations are capable of either producing only a fraction the @xmath0  value found in observations or , under fine - tuned circumstances , the total observed @xmath0  values .    for most objects ,",
    "two explanations are capable of producing the observed @xmath0  values : a ) the observed @xmath0  values come from a variety of mechanisms in a chemically homogeneous medium , where each mechanism is only responsible for a fraction of the total ; and b ) the presence of chemical inhomogeneities within the photoionized region . as of now , no complete self - consistent model has been proposed for either explanation : models for explanation ( a ) have not been able to explain where all the required energy to keep these thermal inhomogeneities comes from , while models for explanation ( b ) have not been able to describe the exact characteristics and evolution of the proposed high metallicity inclusions . as for abundance determinations : option ( a ) would indicate that rls give the correct abundances , or that one could use cels and the formalism of @xmath0  of @xcite to determine abundances ; and models of option ( b ) imply that the chemical abundance is intermediate between those obtained from cels adopting @xmath0=0.00 , and rls adopting a chemically inhomogeneous medium @xcite . for either option",
    ", the abundances determined using cels with @xmath0=0.00 need a systematic correction .",
    "additional evidence supporting chemically homogeneous models with large @xmath0  values implied by the adf problem comes from : the theoretical vs. observational @xmath7 ratio , abundances of f and g young stars of the solar vicinity vs. abundances of h@xmath1  regions , oxygen abundances of o and b stars vs. abundances of h@xmath1  regions , protosolar abundances vs. h@xmath1  region  abundances , considering the effect of galactic chemical evolution ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    in sections [ obs ]  and [ icorr ]",

    "are derived from four and three different line intensity ratios , respectively ; also in this section we derive the mean square temperature inhomogeneities , @xmath0 , in three different ways : i ) from the comparison of the abundances of lines to those of [ ] lines , ii ) using lines , and iii ) from the comparison of the abundance of lines to those of [ ] @xmath8 1907 + ] @xmath8 1909 lines . in section [ ionaab ]  we determine ionic abundances with three different methods : i ) based on rls , ii ) based on cels , and iii ) correcting cels for @xmath0 ; while the total abundances derived from these methods are presented in section [ totabs ] . in section [ clasmr ]  we present the direct method and its shortcomings , the typical correction to the o / h ratio for low metallicity h@xmath1  regions , and the implications for the determinations of extragalactic chemical abundances .",

    "the procedure of line measurement was done using the    splot    task of the iraf package .",
    "line intensities were measured by integrating the flux in the line between two limits over the local continuum estimated by eye .",
    "there were a few cases where line blending was found .",
    "in this situation we used a multiple gaussian profile procedure .",
    "the error in the flux calibration has been estimated to be 1% ; the contribution to the errors due to the noise was estimated from the continuum .",
    "the final adopted errors were estimated using standard error procedures .    the reddening correction , @xmath14(h@xmath5 ) , and the underlying absorption , @xmath15(h@xmath5 ) , were fitted simultaneously to the theoretical ratios .",

    "find that careful determination of chemical abundances in h@xmath1  regions  ( once corrected for depletion of oxygen into dust and for temperature inhomogeneities ) , are consistent with : i ) the protosolar abundances after correcting them for the galactic chemical evolution @xcite , ii ) young f and g stars of the solar vicinity @xcite , and iii ) o and b stars of the orion region @xcite .",
    "since the afore mentioned methods of determining abundances for stars and h@xmath1  regions  are entirely independent , the consistency in the results allows to individually validate each method .",
    "in particular it implies that a model with temperature inhomogeneities is a better approximation to reality than the direct method , that considers a homogeneous temperature structure .",
    "almost all studies of h@xmath1  regions  in the literature are made assuming homogeneous , or nearly homogeneous , temperature throughout the whole object , hence , the abundances derived from these works are underestimated by a factor of approximately 2 .",
    "the study of abundances in low metallicity h@xmath1  regions  is important to set limits in the models of various areas of astrophysics such as the radial abundance gradients in spiral galaxies @xcite , the chemical evolution of starburst galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the primordial helium abundance ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , among others .",
    "consequently , it is of great importance for these studies not to use abundances derived from the direct method , and to use abundances obtained with a method that either allows the presence of thermal inhomogeneities or is not affected by them ( e.g. cels corrected by temperature inhomogeneities or rls ) .",
    "in photoionization models , the temperature is nearly homogeneous because the processes considered for both heating and cooling are nearly proportional to the density squared .",
    "strong thermal inhomogeneities require processes that generate either heating or cooling that are not proportional to the density squared .",
    "observationally , the adf problem emerges when a homogeneous temperature is assumed .",
    "@xcite presented a high spatial resolution map of the columnar electron temperatures of the trapezium with which they found a @xmath0  value from different lines of sight within the nebula , whereas @xcite , studying components and different velocities , found that each line of sight has thermal inhomogeneities .",
    "all available explanations in the literature for the presence of the adf require the presence of thermal inhomogeneities .",
    "there are two families of mechanisms that produce temperature inhomogeneities : i ) an inhomogeneous cooling function of the photoionized region , i.e. chemical inhomogeneities @xcite , and ii ) an inhomogeneous heating , e.g. shock waves , advancing photoionization fronts , shadowed regions , magnetic reconnection ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "there is a small fraction of planetary nebulae and h@xmath1  regions  that are chemically inhomogeneous ; these objects will not be discussed in this paper .",
    "models that are chemically inhomogeneous predict abundances that are intermediate between those derived with the direct method and from rls . for most objects",
    "an inhomogeneous heating mechanism is in better agreement with abundances derived from stellar objects ( see section [ dmimp ] ) , and with the thermal structure of the orion nebula ( see section [ dmshort ] ) .",
    "moreover , @xmath0  values derived with independent methods are consistent with each other within the errors .",
    "specifically , the fact that the @xmath0  values from he and o are consistent , implies that the material in the nebulae is well mixed since these elements have different formation histories @xcite .",
    "typical photoionization model values of @xmath0  are about one order of magnitude smaller than the temperature inhomogeneities determined from observations . with near photoionized objects such as the orion nebula ,",
    "extremely detailed studies can be made to measure precise values of @xmath0 : e.g. @xcite presented a high spatial resolution map of the columnar electron temperatures of the trapezium with which they found that shadowed regions can significantly contribute to the observed thermal inhomogeneities ; @xcite and @xcite were able to isolate individual high density regions and found that cels underestimate abundances ; and @xcite and @xcite studied the head of hh 202 and found that the ionization front has a @xmath0  value significantly higher than that of the nebula .",
    "photoionization models include an energy injection proportional to the density squared ; this should be a good approximation if the energy were dominated by photoionization .",
    "however , the measurements of the filling factor ( which is defined as the occupied volume over the total volume ) argue against such an energy budget model . typical filling factor values for h@xmath1  regions  are in the 0.01 - 0.10 range .",
    "these values are showing that h@xmath1  regions  are pretty much empty , but they are not showing the origin of the energy that is keeping the material apart .",
    "this is strong evidence that the traditional energy budget model to study h@xmath1  regions  is incomplete .",
    "the fact that it is not known what is feeding the filling factor in h@xmath1  regions  does not mean that abundance results considering @xmath0@xmath660.00 are incorrect , it means that models have to be improved to better understand the physics and astrophysics of these objects .",
    "temperature inhomogeneities are showing that photoionization models have to be corrected to account for the additional physics that has not been included .",
    "chemical abundances determined using cels strongly depend on the thermal structure of the nebula , whereas abundances obtained with rls do not . even though we know many processes capable of generating temperature inhomogeneities , we do not know , quantitatively , the relative importance of each one of them",
    ". we can estimate the magnitude and the effect that these thermal inhomogeneities have on the chemical abundances .",
    "although it is interesting to study the origin of such thermal inhomogeneities , it is beyond the scope of this paper to do so . in order to determine abundances we need to know the value of @xmath0  and",
    "not what is producing it .",
    "a detailed analysis was performed for the smc h@xmath1  regions  ngc 456 and ngc 460 .",
    "this analysis involves abundance determinations considering thermal inhomogeneities ( @xmath0@xmath520.00 ) ; for the purpose of comparison with other authors , we also determined abundances with the direct or traditional method , which assumes a homogeneous temperature structure ( @xmath0=0.00 ) .",
    "the abundances of ngc 346 @xcite , ngc 456 , and ngc 460 , are similar once corrected for dust depletion .",
    "the o / h abundances of the smc h@xmath1  regions  are 0.58 dex lower than those of the ism of the solar vicinity , and 0.46 dex lower than the solar photosphere .",
    "this indicates that the small magellanic cloud is chemically less evolved than the milky way and so is the best laboratory to study in detail the ism of low metallicity galaxies .",
    "determinations of oxygen abundances in this work were done with three methods : i ) using rls , ii ) using the direct method for cels , and iii ) using cels relaxing the homogeneous temperature assumption .",
    "the first two methods are not compatible .",
    "temperature inhomogeneities of some sort are required to reconcile observations of rls and cels .",
    "the adf only becomes a problem if one demands a homogeneous thermal structure from the start .",
    "our results confirm that the adf problem can be solved by taking into account the presence of thermal inhomogeneities in a chemically homogeneous medium .",
    "abundances of h@xmath1  regions  are used to constrain models of many areas of astrophysics , therefore , we need to derive abundances from gaseous nebulae with the highest precision possible .",
    "a crucial aspect of the available observations is that they require a complex thermal structure ; consequently , thermal inhomogeneities must be taken into account to determine abundances .",
    "there are many ways to obtain a @xmath0  value @xcite , the most commonly used is based on the comparison of abundances derived with [ ] lines with abundances derived using lines . in this paper",
    "we also obtained @xmath0  values from lines and from the comparison of abundances derived using iue uv ] and [ ] lines with abundances derived from optical lines .",
    "for both ngc 456 and ngc 460 , we combined @xmath0  values of o@xmath32 and he@xmath33 to obtain an average @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath0  value for c@xmath32 in ngc 456 was not included in such average of @xmath0  because optical and uv observations do not come from the same place in the h@xmath1  region ; nonetheless , this @xmath0(c@xmath32 ) is relevant because it is not consistent with a homogeneous temperature structure in the h@xmath1  region .    to obtain accurate values of @xmath0 , good s",
    "/ n is required for the faint lines of , , and . and",
    "for the same volume are consistent within the errors .",
    "since each @xmath0  value comes from a different element and they have different formation histories , this is evidence that the material within the nebula is well mixed ; otherwise those @xmath0  values of different elements would differ from one another .",
    "the homogeneous temperature assumption of the direct method should only be taken as a first approximation because , in addition to photoionization , other energy sources have to be taken into account .",
    "temperature inhomogeneities measure the overall importance of the many mechanisms that inject energy into the system .",
    "we find that o / h abundances of low metallicity h@xmath1  regions  are systematically underestimated and have to be corrected by a factor of 0.25@xmath1-@xmath10.45 dex .",
    "we suggest that , if no additional information is available , an increase of 0.35 dex on the o / h ratio should be used ; this correction includes temperature inhomogeneities and oxygen depletion into dust .",
