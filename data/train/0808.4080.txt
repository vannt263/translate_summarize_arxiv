    "gravastars have been recently presented by mazur and mottola  @xcite as a new exact solution to the einstein equations . in the original suggestion these are compact , spherically symmetric and non - singular objects , that can be taken to be almost as compact as black holes . in this `` three - layer '' model ,",
    "the high compactness is supported by a de - sitter core , surrounded by a shell of matter , and the exterior vacuum spacetime is , of course , that of the schwarzschild solution .    according to the original picture proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , a massive collapsing star could go through a phase transition when its radius approaches @xmath4 , forming a gravastar instead of a black hole .",
    "although the dynamical processes that would lead to the formation of a gravastar are far from being understood and could probably be described as rather exotic , the final state can be described by an exact ( and fairly simple ) solution of the einstein equations .",
    "this is what stimulates our interest in this matter .",
    "the original gravastar model has inspired many subsequent works , but always describing stationary solutions ( except from ref .",
    "@xcite , as we will see below ) . a related simplified model with an infinitesimally thin shell was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and later also generalized in ref .",
    "several possibilities for the interior solution have been considered in refs .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite , among others .",
    "more recently , a solution for electrically charged gravastar configurations was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and limits on the existence of gravastars from astronomical data were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "also an effort has been made to assess the properties of gravastars when these are perturbed  @xcite .",
    "the result of this analysis has lead , among other things , to the evidence that perturbations in spherical gravastars can be used to discriminate them from black holes , thus removing one of the most serious consequences of the existence of such _ ultra - compact _ objects  @xcite .",
    "note that hereafter we define as ultra - compact any stellar object whose compactness @xmath5 is much larger than that of typical neutron stars of comparable mass and angular momentum , and which is @xmath6 .",
    "this definition is inevitably weak and ambiguous , but it aims at focussing on the large compactness of gravastars as the most relevant property .",
    "clearly , black holes are always more compact than any possible gravastar model ( although their compactness is only infinitesimally smaller for nonrotating models ) but the relevant point to bear in mind is that gravastars have compactness much larger than that of standard stars and comparable ( although smaller ) to that of black holes .    further expanding on the perturbative analysis carried out in ref .",
    "@xcite , cardoso et al .",
    "@xcite have recently considered the properties of perturbed and rotating gravastars and assessed , within the slow - rotation approximation , their stability against the _ `` ergoregion instability''_. we recall that such instability affects rapidly rotating and very compact stellar objects which do have an ergoregion but do not have an event horizon  @xcite .",
    "the kerr black hole is a good example of an object that has an ergoregion .",
    "but an ergoregion can also develop in compact stars that are sufficiently rapidly rotating . in this region ,",
    "the relativistic frame dragging is so strong that no stationary orbits are allowed .",
    "all trajectories of particles in this region must rotate in the same direction of the rotation of the star .",
    "because of this effect , some particles in the ergoregion can be measured by an observer at rest at infinity as having negative energy .",
    "this happens because this observer measures the energy of the particles by projecting their four - momentum vectors onto his four - velocity .",
    "as the observer is stationary ( and no stationary trajectories are allowed inside the ergoregion ) , his four - velocity is outside of the light cone of the particles in the ergoregion .",
    "this causes some of these particles to have their energy measured as negative by the observer at infinity .",
    "the instability occurs then in the following way . from an initially small perturbation with negative energy trapped in the ergoregion",
    ", one can extract positive energy ( that leaves the star and goes to infinity ) by increasing the negative energy inside the ergoregion ( thus conserving the total energy ) .",
    "as the negative energy trapped in the ergoregion increases , the star radiates even more positive energy to infinity and this process leads to the instability .",
    "this process is very general , and scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational waves become unstable in a star with an ergoregion .",
    "this paper is dedicated to reconsider the analysis carried out by cardoso et al .",
    "@xcite and to extend it to a larger space of possible models , taking into account the limits on the thickness of the matter shell and on its compactness .",
    "when doing this , we confirm the results of cardoso et al .",
    "@xcite for their models , but also show that the conclusions drawn were excessively restrictive . in particular we show that not all rotating gravastars are unstable to the ergoregion instability .",
    "rather , we find that models of rotating gravastars without an ergoregion ( and therefore stable ) can be constructed also for extreme rotation rates , namely for models with @xmath7 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the gravastar s angular momentum and mass , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : model ] we briefly review our gravastar model and the slow - rotation approximation . in section  [ sec : perturb ]",
    "we develop the equations for scalar perturbations and present the wkb approximation used . in section  [ sec : discussion ] we present our results and analyze the behavior of the instability in the space of parameters and in section  [ sec : conclusions ] we present our concluding remarks .",
    "we use @xmath8 throughout the paper .",
    "we start our analysis by adding a uniform rotation to the simple fluid gravastar model with anisotropic pressure presented in ref .",
    "we recall that the use of anisotropic pressures was introduced by cattoen et al .",
    "@xcite to remove in part the complications produced by the infinitesimal shells in the original gravastar model of mazur and mottola  @xcite . in this way",
    ", the anisotropic pressure replaces the surface tension introduced by the matching of the metric in the infinitesimally thin shells .",
    "although the use of an anisotropic pressure is essentially arbitrary , as arbitrary are the equations of state used to describe such a pressure , it has the appealing property of being continuous and thus of allowing one to build equilibrium models without the presence of infinitesimally thin shells and thus look more seriously into the issue of stability .",
    "we write therefore the line element for a finite - thickness rotating gravastar with anisotropic pressures within the slow - rotation approximation , ( namely at first - order in the angular velocity in the small parameter @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the keplerian limit ) as @xmath11 together with the energy momentum tensor given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the energy density of the gravastar , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the radial and tangential pressures , respectively .",
    "the vector @xmath16 is the fluid four - velocity , @xmath17^{-1/2}\\ , , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the vector @xmath18 is orthogonal to the fluid four - velocity , @xmath19    the functions @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the line element ( [ metric ] ) are given in terms of the mass @xmath22 and the radial pressure @xmath23 , as in the non - rotating case , @xmath24 where a prime denotes a ( total ) radial derivative .",
    "as usual , we define the gravitational mass within a radius @xmath25 as @xmath26 and @xmath27 with the coefficients @xmath28 given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the `` thickness '' of the gravastar and @xmath31 the equation of state used for @xmath32 serves here only as a closure relation and is therefore chosen to be in the simplest possible form , namely a polynomial of the type  @xcite @xmath33     \\left(\\frac{\\rho}{\\rho_0}\\right)\\rho\\ , ,    \\label{eos}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is determined by demanding that the maximum sound speed @xmath35 at which @xmath36 coincides with the speed of light to rule out a superluminal behavior . finally , the tangential pressure @xmath37 is given by the anisotropic tov equation @xmath38\\ , .",
    "\\label{p_t}\\ ] ] the function @xmath39 can be shown to be of first order in the angular velocity @xmath40 and it describes the dragging of inertial frames .",
    "formally , it can be obtained from the @xmath41 component of the field equations  @xcite @xmath42 which gives , for our anisotropic case , @xmath43 where @xmath44 for the region of the spacetime interior to the gravastar .",
    "it is easy to see that eq .",
    "( [ dragging ] ) is equivalent to eq .",
    "( 2.25 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite . in the exterior region , on the other hand , we have @xmath45 the definition of @xmath46 in eq .",
    "( [ def_varpi ] ) deserves some attention and it corresponds to the difference between @xmath40 , the angular velocity of the gravastar ( as seen by an observer at rest ) , and @xmath39 , which gives the angular velocity of a zero angular momentum observer ( zamo ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath47 is the angular velocity of the gravastar as seen by the zamo .    as a general result in the asymptotically flat limit",
    ", the dragging must go to zero as @xmath48 for @xmath49 , thus defining @xmath1 as the angular momentum of the spacetime  @xcite .",
    "demanding now that the exterior equations ( [ varpi_ext ] ) to be consistent with this asymptotic limit implies immediately that the integration constant @xmath1 in ( [ varpi_ext ] ) should be identified as the total angular momentum of the gravastar .    a representative behavior of the frame - dragging function @xmath39 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_drag ] , for a gravastar with thickness of the shell @xmath50 and compactness @xmath51 .",
    "the frame - dragging is obtained by numerically integrating eq .",
    "( [ dragging ] ) , with initial conditions @xmath52 and @xmath53 finite . as shown in the figure ,",
    "the solution for @xmath39 in the interior of the gravastar is constant [ _ cf . _",
    "( [ dragging ] ) and ( [ def_varpi ] ) ] and monotonically decreases outwards .",
    "the two integration constants @xmath40 and @xmath1 can then be determined by matching the interior and exterior solutions at the boundary @xmath54 .",
    "finally , in the exterior of the gravastar , @xmath39 goes asymptotically to zero [ _ cf . _  eq .",
    "( [ varpi_ext ] ) ] .    , for a gravastar with @xmath55 , @xmath50 and @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "we can see that @xmath58 in the interior ( @xmath59 ) and @xmath60 in the exterior region ( @xmath61 ) . ]",
    "we recall that if a compact relativistic star rotates sufficiently fast , it will posses an ergoregion , namely a region in which the frame - dragging is so intense that stationary orbits are no longer possible . within this region",
    "even massless particles , such as photons , will be involved in the `` drag '' and all trajectories will rotate in the prograde direction . mathematically , the boundary of the ergoregion is defined as where the covariant @xmath62-component of the metric has a zero , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath63 and it should be noted that the ergoregion does not need to be restricted to the exterior of the compact star and , rather , it can also involve regions interior to the star .",
    "the main interest in the existence of an ergoregion in a compact star stems from the fact that these regions lead to a secular instability by means of which any initially small perturbation will grow exponentially in time  @xcite .",
    "clearly , one expects that nonlinear effects will intervene to limit the growth of the instability once this has reached a sufficiently high ( saturation ) amplitude which , however , can not be determined on the basis of a linear perturbative investigation .",
    "while determining such an amplitude is of great physical interest , we will here limit ourselves to a simple linear analysis of the problem . on the other hand , we will determine not only if an instability can or can not develop but also , and more importantly , the characteristic timescale for the growth of the instability . indeed , as shown already many years ago in ref .",
    "@xcite , for ultra - compact uniform - density stars , the timescale for the growth of scalar perturbations via the ergoregion instability can sometimes be several orders of magnitude larger than the age of the universe .",
    "when this is case , the instability grows so slowly that the stars are effectively stable even if the linear analysis reveals that they are mathematically unstable .",
    "hereafter we will concentrate on scalar perturbations and within the wkb approximation .",
    "there are many references in the literature where this method is described , but we suggest for instance ref .",
    "the wkb method ( from wentzel , kramers , brillouin ) is used to approximate the solution of differential equations of the general form @xmath64 where @xmath65 . as we will see below , the scalar perturbations that we are considering",
    "are described by eq .",
    "( [ scalar ] ) , which has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ generic_wkb ] ) above .",
    "the same equation is often found to arise in quantum mechanics , but also in classical physics problems .",
    "the key point of the approximation is the assumption @xmath65 ( high frequency approximation in quantum mechanics ) .",
    "it allows us to consider that , for every @xmath66 , then @xmath67 is approximately constant between two zeros of @xmath68 .",
    "it is easy to see that this approximation greatly simplifies the integration of eq .",
    "( [ generic_wkb ] ) .    of course , studying the response of a rotating gravastar to electromagnetic or gravitational perturbations would be astrophysically more interesting and realistic . however , the use of scalar perturbations has the important advantage that in this case one can decompose the perturbations in spherical harmonics and reduce the perturbation equation to a single ordinary differential equation , which can be integrated with very modest computational costs and high accuracy .",
    "in addition , because the order of magnitude for the growth of the perturbations is expected to be the same for scalar , electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations [ this is indeed the case for the decay of perturbations of different spins in a schwarzschild spacetime ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for some numerical results ) ] , estimating the growth time of scalar perturbations allows for a simple and direct extension also to other types of perturbations .    bearing this in mind , we next proceed to the study of the massless scalar wave equation in the slowly rotating gravastar background that we introduced in section  [ sec : model ] .",
    "we briefly review here the basic steps usually followed in this type of analysis ; such steps can be found in many papers and are reproduced here only for completeness .",
    "the wave equation @xmath69 can be separated by using the _ ansatz _ @xmath70 where the eigenfrequency @xmath71 is in general complex , with @xmath72 . as a result",
    ", @xmath73 leads to an exponential growth , while @xmath74 leads to a decay .    in the high @xmath75 limit ( and taking @xmath76 ) , eq .",
    "( [ kg_eq ] ) can be written using eq .",

    "our stability analysis translates therefore to finding the complex eigenfrequencies @xmath71 of the scalar wave modes that satisfy eq .",

    "however , because these frequencies generally have the real part being much larger than the imaginary one , _",
    "i.e. _  , @xmath92 ( or , equivalently , @xmath93 ) , it is a reasonable approximation to consider @xmath71 as essentially a real number .",
    "it is also more convenient to the problem to use @xmath94 instead of @xmath71 itself ( see the appendix for more details ) .",
    "0.2 cm     furthermore , when considered within the wkb approximation , the potentials @xmath95 determine four different regions which are reminiscent of those appearing for waves trapped in the potential well of @xmath83 . to illustrate this in more detail we show in fig .",
