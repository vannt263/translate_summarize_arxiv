    "a precise knowledge of the neutron - neutron scattering length @xmath0 is , e.g. , important for an understanding of the effects of charge symmetry breaking in nucleon  nucleon forces @xcite .",
    "the scattering length @xmath0 characterizes scattering at low energies .",
    "it is related to the on ",
    "shell @xmath3 scattering amplitude @xmath4 as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the relative momentum between the two neutrons , @xmath7 the scattering phase shift in the @xmath3 partial wave and @xmath8 is the effective range . at low energies the terms of order @xmath9 can be neglected to very high accuracy .",
    "obviously , a direct determination of @xmath0 in a scattering experiment is extremely difficult due to the absence of a free neutron target .",
    "for this reason , the value for @xmath0 is to be obtained from analyses of reactions where there are three particles in the final state , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath10 @xcite or @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "there is some spread in the results for @xmath0 obtained by the various groups .",
    "in particular , two independent analyses of the reaction @xmath11 give significantly different values for @xmath0 , namely @xmath12 fm @xcite and @xmath13 fm @xcite , whereas the latest value obtained from the reaction @xmath10 is @xmath14 fm @xcite . at the same time , for the proton - proton scattering length , which is directly accessible , a very recent analysis reports @xmath15 fm @xcite after correcting for electromagnetic effects .",
    "this means that even the sign of @xmath16 is not fixed .",
    ", @xmath0 is not corrected for electromagnetic effects . however , since those are only of the order of 0.3 fm @xcite they are not relevant for the sign of @xmath17 .",
    "but they ought to be taken into account for determining charge symmetry breaking effects quantitatively . ]",
    "it should be mentioned , however , that state of the art calculations for the binding energy difference of tritium and @xmath18he suggest that @xmath19  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we discuss the possibility to determine @xmath0 from differential cross sections in the reaction @xmath20 .",
    "specifically , we show that one can extract the value of @xmath0 reliably by fitting the shape of a properly chosen momentum spectrum . in this case",
    "the main source of inaccuracies , caused by uncertainties in the single ",
    "nucleon photoproduction multipole @xmath21 , is largely suppressed .",
    "furthermore there is a suppression of the quasi - free pion production at specific angles .",
    "we show that at these angular configurations the extraction of @xmath0 can be done with minimal theoretical uncertainty .",
    "our investigation is based on the recent work of ref .",
    "@xcite in which the transition operator for the reaction @xmath22 was calculated up to order @xmath23 in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) with @xmath24 , where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is the pion ( nucleon ) mass .",
    "half - integer powers of @xmath27 in the expansion arise from the unitarity ( two and three  body ) cuts ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the total cross section are in very good agreement with the experimental data .",
    "the only input parameter that entered the calculation was the leading single ",
    "nucleon photoproduction multipole @xmath21 , which was fixed from a fourth - order one - loop calculation of bernard et al .",
    "the uncertainty in @xmath21 is the main theoretical error in the calculation presented in ref .  @xcite . besides this transition operator ,",
    "in the present study we use nucleon  nucleon ( @xmath28 ) wave functions constructed likewise in the framework of chpt , namely those of the nnlo interaction of ref .",
    "this allows us to estimate the theoretical uncertainty which arises from variations in the wave functions .",
    "in fact , as soon as we include consistently all terms up to order @xmath23 , we expect the ambiguities due to different wave functions not to be larger than a @xmath29 correction , for only at this order the leading counter term which absorbs these effects enters .",
    "this expectation is indeed quantitatively confirmed in the concrete calculations .",
    "since we work within chiral perturbation theory we can estimate the effect of higher orders in terms of established expansion parameters together with the standard assumption that additional short ranged operators , that enter at higher orders , behave in accordance with the power counting ( the so - called naturalness assumption ) .",
    "this method was also applied in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the reaction @xmath30 was investigated as a tool to extract @xmath0 .",
    "however , to know the effect of higher orders for sure , one has to calculate them .",
    "therefore , to derive a reliable uncertainty estimate for the extraction of @xmath0 from the @xmath31 reaction , we use our leading order calculation as baseline result and estimate the theoretical uncertainty from the effects of the higher orders that we calculated completely . based on this",
    ", we find a theoretical uncertainty @xmath32 we therefore argue that the reaction @xmath1 appears to be a good tool for the extraction of @xmath0 .",
    "to end this section , we remark that in ref .  @xcite a method",
    "was proposed to extract scattering lengths from @xmath31 induced meson production .",
    "however , this approach should not be used here , since the momentum transfer is not sufficiently large to use this method and with our explicit calculation of the transition operator we can reach a significantly higher accuracy .",
    "the diagrams that contribute to the reaction @xmath33 are shown on fig .",
    "the kinematical variables are defined in fig .",
    "[ vec ] .    before going into the details",
    "some comments are necessary regarding the relevant scales of the problem . in the near threshold regime of interest here ( excess energies of at most 20 mev above the pion production threshold ) the outgoing pion momenta are small compared even to the pion mass .",
    "thus , in addition to the conventional expansion parameters of chpt @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where @xmath36 denotes the chiral symmetry breaking scale of order of ( and often identified with ) the nucleon mass , and @xmath37 denotes the photon momentum in the center  of  mass system which is of order of the pion mass , we can also regard @xmath38 as small , where @xmath39 denotes the momentum of the outgoing pion . in what follows",
    "we will perform an expansion in two parameters , namely @xmath40 obviously , the value of the second parameter depends on the excess energy @xmath41 .",
    "the energy regime of interest to us corresponds to excess energies up to 20 mev .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath42 , @xmath43 , at the highest energy considered is thus about 1/2 . since this is numerically close to @xmath44 we use the following assignment for the expansion parameter : @xmath45the tree level @xmath46 vertex , as it appears in diagrams ( a1 ) and ( a2 ) in fig  [ diag ] ( the vertex is labeled as filled square ) , contributes at leading order ( order @xmath47 ) , and orders @xmath48 and @xmath49 , depending on the one  body operator used .",
    "note that the loop diagrams with @xmath50 rescattering ( see diagrams ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) in fig .",
    "[ diag ] ) contribute at order @xmath51 as well as at @xmath52 , @xmath53 and at @xmath54 .",
    "the origin of the non  integer power of @xmath27 are the two  body ( @xmath50 ) and three  body ( @xmath55 ) singularities .",
    "thus , all terms up to @xmath23 are explicitly taken into account in our calculation of the transition operator .",
    "as already emphasized , we employ wave functions evaluated in the same framework in order to have a fully consistent calculation . in our work ,",
    "we use the n@xmath56lo wave functions corresponding to the chiral nn forces introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite and based on the spectral function regularization ( sfr ) scheme @xcite . at this order , the nn force receives contributions from one - pion exchange , two - pion exchange at the subleading order as well as from all possible short - range contact interactions with up to two derivatives .",
    "in addition , the dominant isospin - breaking correction due to the charged - to - neutral pion mass difference in the one - pion exchange potential together with the two leading isospin - breaking s - wave contact interactions were taken into account @xcite .",
    "the two corresponding low - energy constants were adjusted to reproduce the scattering lengths @xmath0 and @xmath57 .",
    "the sfr cutoff @xmath58 is varied in the range @xmath59 mev .",
    "it was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite that such a choice for @xmath58 provides a natural separation of the long- and short - range parts of the nuclear force and allows to improve the convergence of the chiral expansion @xcite .",
    "the cutoff @xmath60 in the lippmann - schwinger equation is varied in the range @xmath61 mev . for an extensive discussion on the choice of @xmath60 and @xmath58 the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .",
    "in this section we outline the features of the differential cross section for unpolarized particles that are important for our considerations . for later convenience",
    "let us consider the function @xmath62 proportional to the square of the matrix element as well as the five  fold differential cross section @xmath63 where @xmath64 ( @xmath65 ) stands for the relative momentum of the two final neutrons ( momentum of the final pion ) in the center  of  mass frame , @xmath66 ( @xmath67 ) for the corresponding polar and azimuthal angles , respectively , and @xmath68 for the squared and averaged amplitude . in eq .",
    "( [ xs ] ) @xmath69 is an irrelevant dimensionful constant . in what follows",
    "we will consider only shapes of cross sections and therefore the value of @xmath69 is not important for our considerations .",
    "the value of @xmath39 at given @xmath6 and excess energy @xmath41 is fixed by energy conservation : @xmath70 hence we write @xmath71 in eq .",
    "( [ xs ] ) .    in the following",
    "we choose the momentum @xmath72 of the initial photon to be along the @xmath73axis .",
    "then the cross sections at a certain excess energy @xmath41 depend on four variables , namely the magnitude of the relative momentum of the two final neutrons @xmath6 , the polar angles of the vectors @xmath64 and @xmath65 , and the difference between the azimuthal angles of those two momenta .",
    "unpolarized cross sections are invariant under rotations around the beam axis , which makes the dependence on the missing angle trivial .",
    "typical differential cross sections @xmath62 are shown in fig .",
    "[ difxs ] as a function of @xmath6 at some fixed set of angles @xmath74 and @xmath75 mev for two different values of @xmath76 .",
    "one can see from this figure that for the differential cross section @xmath62 of eq .",
    "( [ xs ] ) there are two characteristic regions :    1 .   the region of quasi - free production ( qf ) at large @xmath6 , which corresponds to the dominance of those diagrams of fig .  [ diag ] that do not contain the @xmath28 interaction in the final or intermediate states .",
    "in the appendix we give explicit expressions for the diagram @xmath77  the most significant diagram of this type . at large @xmath6 the pion momentum @xmath78",
    "is small ( see eq .",
    "( [ conserv ] ) ) and the arguments of the deuteron wave function in eqs .",
    "( [ qfs ] ) and ( [ qft ] ) may become small for particular combinations of @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this feature gives rise to a peak in the differential cross section at large @xmath6 .",
    "the region with prominence of the strong @xmath81 final  state interaction ( fsi ) at small @xmath6 ( in fact , we would have the strongest final state interaction at zero relative momentum , however the cross section goes to zero at @xmath82 due to the phase space , therefore we see a peak shape ) .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ difxs ] that the fsi peak depends on the value of @xmath76 only marginally , whereas the quasi - free peak shows significant dependence on this angle .",
    "in particular , the quasi - free production is largely suppressed at @xmath83  at this angle the arguments of the wave functions in both terms in the r.h.s .",
    "( [ qfs ] ) and ( [ qft ] ) are large .",
    "it can also be seen from fig .",
    "[ difxs ] ( right panel ) that the effect of higher orders is more important for the quasi - free production amplitude  the influence of higher - order effects on the fsi production is quite small .",
    "another interesting observation is that the contributions of higher orders change the relative height of the two peaks  the fsi peak goes up whereas the qf peak goes down when we proceed from the lo calculation to the order @xmath23 . in order to suppress the distortions of the spectrum due to higher orders in the chiral expansion , which is the condition for an extraction of @xmath0 with small theoretical uncertainty",
