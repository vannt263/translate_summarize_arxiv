    "the angular momentum loss of the gas in the accretion disc in a close binary system is one of the very important phenomena in the astrophysics .",
    "the most accepted model that explains the mechanism of angular momentum transport is the @xmath2 disc model @xcite . in this model ,",
    "viscosity originating from turbulence , magnetism or whatever , is supposed to transport the angular momentum",
    ". however , in this model the details of how the viscosity is generated are still unknown .",
    "an alternative model that needs no viscosity for angular momentum transfer is the spiral shock model in which spiral shaped shock waves are formed in the accretion disc due to the tidal force of the mass losing star .",
    "this model was proposed by @xcite .",
    "they conducted two - dimensional hydrodynamic calculations of a flow of invisicid adiabatic gas , and found the spiral shocks numerically . since then a number of two - dimensional simulations have been carried out , and it has been claimed that the spiral shocks really appear in the accretion discs @xcite . besides",
    ", @xcite obtained self - similar solutions of spiral shocks for idealized accretion discs .    for this spiral shock model ,",
    "two major points have been questioned as regard to the validity of the model :    ( i ) : :    the three - dimensional effect might suppress the formation of spiral    shocks @xcite . (",
    "ii ) : :    the cooling effect due to radiation is not taken into account    explicitly .",
    "though such effect has been considered by assuming a lower    specific heat ratio for adiabatic gas , the obtained disc was still too    hot .    as regard to the question ( i ) , three - dimensional simulations have been carried out mostly by particle methods .",
    "such simulations tend to give rather diffusive results if a sufficient number of particles are not available .",
    "spiral shocks are likely disappeared particularly for those cases with a lower specific heat ratio for which the pitch angle of the spiral shock decreases .",
    "for example , @xcite carried out three - dimensional simulations using smoothed particle hydrodynamics method .",
    "as many as @xmath3 particles were employed in the calculations .",
    "they showed that an accretion disc was formed and spiral shocks appeared for the case of @xmath4 , but spiral shocks disappeared for the case of @xmath5 and @xmath0 .",
    "three - dimensional simulation using either the finite difference or finite volume method was first carried out by @xcite .",
    "they calculated the case of @xmath4 with a mass ratio of unity using the upwind tvd roe scheme and a generalized curvilinear coordinate system .",
    "although the calculation was continued up to only a half revolution period because of the limitation of cpu time , they successfully showed the existence of spiral shocks on the accretion disc .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite carried out three - dimensional numerical simulations of accretion discs by means of the finite difference method .",
    "they employed a tvd roe scheme with a monotonic flux limiter of the osher s form .",
    "a cartesian coordinate system was used in the calculations .",
    "their results showed that no hot spot was formed .",
    "furthermore , disc formation was inhibited for higher @xmath6 and no spiral shock was seen .",
    "@xcite carried out two- and three - dimensional numerical simulations of an accretion disc in a close binary system with a higher resolution using simplified flux vector splitting finite volume method @xcite .",
    "their computational region only covered the vicinity of the mass accreting star .",
    "the gas from the mass losing star was assumed to flow into the computational domain through a rectangular hole located at the l1 lagrangian point .",
    "they obtained quasi steady solutions , and confirmed the existence of both an accretion disc and spiral shocks for all cases with @xmath4 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "it was shown that a smaller @xmath6 value resulted in a more tightly wound spiral shock in two - dimensional calculations , but such tendency was not so obvious in three - dimensional cases .",
    "it was also shown that the spiral shock waves disappeared when tidal force due to the mass losing star was artificially cut off .",
    "@xcite carried out three - dimensional simulations of a close binary system containing both the mass accreting star and the mass losing star , and investigated the interaction between the l1 stream and the accretion disc . in the calculations ,",
    "the ratio of constant specific heat was chosen as @xmath4 and @xmath9 .",
    "they confirmed the existence of accretion disc as well as spiral shocks .",
    "no hot spot was found in the accretion disc .",
    "instead , they found that a bow shock wave was formed due to the collision of the l1 stream and the rotating disc .",
    "it was shown that this bow shock wave heated the outer part of the accretion disc , and also enhanced the density perturbation in the disc resulting in a more effective transfer of angular momentum by the tidal torque .    from above numerical results",
    ", one can assume the existence of spiral shocks rather firmly even for three - dimensional accretion discs .",
    "this view is further supported by a recent observational evidence .",
    "@xcite found the first convincing evidence for spiral structure in the accretion disc of the eclipsing dwarf nova binary ip pegasi using the technique known as doppler tomography .",
    "next , let us examine the question ( ii ) .",
    "in the past numerical simulations of accretion discs , it has been customary to assume an adiabatic gas with a lower specific heat ratio than that of a mono - atomic gas ( @xmath10 ) to account for non - adiabatic process of radiative cooling .",
    "so far , no simulation that accounts for radiative cooling effect with @xmath1 has been made to show whether a disc structure is really formed and spiral shocks appear .",
    "it is also yet to know how good is the approximation to employ an adiabatic gas with a lower @xmath6 for simulating actual flowfield with radiative cooling effect .",
    "recently , @xcite carried out two - dimensional hydrodynamic calculations of accretion discs including both the @xmath2-type viscosity and the effect of energy loss from the surface by radiation .",
    "they followed the evolution of the local disc thickness in the one - zone model of @xcite .",
    "the computational domain , however , only covered the vicinity of the mass accreting star . in their calculation , spiral shocks",
    "were clearly observed which dominated the disc evolution in a hydrodynamical time - scale .",
    "the purpose of this work is first to obtain the two - dimensional flowfield in a close binary system with radiative cooling effect , and then to explore whether a disc structure is really formed and spiral shocks appear in the accretion disc .",
    "moreover , we would like to examine how good is the approximation of using a lower @xmath6 value for simulating non - adiabatic processes of radiative cooling in the hydrodynamic calculation of accretion discs .",
    "we therefore solve the two - dimensional euler equations with a constant specific heat ratio of mono - atomic gas ( @xmath1 ) for a thin disc on the equatorial plane , and include radiative cooling effect by discharging energy in the vertical directions from the top and bottom surfaces of the disc .",
    "we employ the flux - limited diffusion ( fld ) approximation to obtain radiative heat flux values . in the present study",
    ", we consider a realistic case of the observed close binary system .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ section2 ] we briefly describe the numerical method , physical assumptions and numerical treatment of radiative transfer . in  [ section3 ]",

    "the orbital period is @xmath12 $ ] .",
    "the mass of these two stars are @xmath13 for the mass accreting star and @xmath14 for the mass losing star , respectively . in the present study",
    ", we assume the surface density of the mass losing star to be @xmath15 $ ] .",
    "the basic equations describing a two - dimensional flow of perfect gas in a rotating frame of reference can be described as @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the density , the @xmath25 and @xmath26 components of the velocity , the total energy per unit volume , the gas pressure , the @xmath25 and @xmath26 components of the net force that includes the gravity force , the coriolis force and the centrifugal force , and the @xmath27 component of the radiative energy flux , respectively .",
    "we ignore the radiation pressure because it is negligibly small if compared with the gas pressure .",
    "the equation of state is given by @xmath28 which is that of an ideal gas characterized by a constant ratio of specific heats @xmath6 .",
    "[ fig_1 ]    a finite volume approach is used to discretize the governing equations .",

    "although we assume a stationary gas , the higher pressure inside of the mass losing star drives the gas flown into the computational domain .",
    "note that if we employ @xmath32 as a typical velocity scale as was in the previous works , where @xmath33 is the separation of the two stars and @xmath34 is the angular velocity of the system , the dimensionless sound velocity of the ejected gas becomes @xmath35 .",
    "as a boundary condition at the surface of the mass accreting star as well as at the outer boundary of the computational domain , we assume a vacuum condition in which any gas reaching there is simply absorbed in . as an initial condition ,",
    "we assume a gas with very low density , @xmath36 $ ] , and high temperature , @xmath37 $ ] , that fills up the entire computational domain .    in order to avoid the numerical instability at the initial stage , we first calculate the flow of the gas with @xmath1 without radiative cooling up to @xmath38 time steps using first - order - accurate scheme .",
    "after that we switch to second - order - accurate scheme . at the same time , the @xmath6 value is changed for relevant cases .",
    "the radiative cooling effect is also included for non - adiabatic cases .",
    "our computational domain includes both the mass losing star and the mass accreting star on the equatorial plane ( fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] ) . the computational domain that contains the mass losing star has @xmath39 grid points ,",

    "these two domains are connected by a narrow strip that has @xmath41 grid points .",
    "it is assumed that energy discharge due to radiative cooling occurs in the vertical directions from the top and bottom surfaces of the disc . because the present flowfield is confined in a two - dimensional equatorial plan ,",
    "it is necessary to assume the distribution of physical quantities in the vertical direction in the disc for calculation of radiation .",
    "we assume a hydrostatic balance in the vertical direction to determine the thickness of the disc , and that the physical quantities in the vertical direction are constant with the local values in the equatorial plan .",
    "the thickness of the disc @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the sound speed of the gas on the disc , the keplerian frequency , the radial distance from the mass accreting star and the gravitational constant , respectively .",
    "the coupling of the flowfield and the radiation field is occurred through the term of @xmath48 that appears in the energy equation .",
    "@xmath48 is obtained by solving the following equation for radiation energy @xmath49 where @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the planck function , the radiation energy density per unit volume , the speed of light and opacity , respectively . because the speed of light is far larger than the sound velocity , and we only seek for a steady state solution",
    ", we ignore the time differential term that appears in the radiative transfer equation .    in the present work we employ the kramer s opacity which has no dependence on frequency .",
    "this kramer s opacity is suitable for the calculation of pure hydrogen gas above @xmath54 $ ] , and is written in the following form @xcite @xmath55 , \\label{eq-6}\\ ] ] where @xmath56 is the temperature of the gas .",
    "as mentioned earlier , we consider the radiative transfer only in the vertical direction of the disc , i.e. the @xmath27 direction perpendicular to the @xmath57 plane .",

    "the radiative heat flux in the accretion disc is calculated by the fld approximation @xcite .",
    "we assume the gas is in local thermodynamic equilibrium at a temperature that needs not correspond to that of the radiation field .",

    ", the radiative flux can be written in the form of fick s law of diffusion @xcite as @xmath58 with a diffusion coefficient , @xmath59 , given by @xmath60 the dimensionless function @xmath61 is called as the flux limiter .",
    "we employ minerbo s model @xcite as a choice of @xmath62 , i.e. a constraint on the anisotropy of the radiation field .",
    "minerbo assumed a piecewise linear variation of the specific intensity with angle , and found the functional form of the flux limiter as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is a dimensionless quantity @xmath65 . in the optically thin limit @xmath66",

    "radiative cooling effect is not included .",
    "it is shown that the disc structure is formed and the spiral shocks are appeared in each case . for the case of @xmath1 , the spiral arms are less clear as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ( a ) .",
    "this is because the contour lines are plotted at equal interval while the density in the disc for this case is relatively lower than that in the l1 stream .",
    "it should be noted that the steady state is not steady in a strict sense , but slightly oscillates .",
    "especially , for the case of @xmath1 , the density pattern and the shock position periodically change with time , although the general pattern in the inner and outer region remains unchanged .",
    "the temporal fluctuation of the disc structure , however , is not significant and the density distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] ( a ) gives a typical one for the case of @xmath1 .",
    "this is suggested by the fact that the present density distribution virtually coincides with that of the ensemble average taken from @xmath74 to @xmath75 time steps .",
    "the pitch angle of spiral arms has a clear correlation with @xmath6 .",
    "the lower @xmath6 thus leads to a tightly wound spiral shocks .",

    "[ fig_2 ] ( d ) shows the density distribution for the case in which the specific heat ratio is fixed as @xmath80 and the effect of radiative cooing is accounted for .",

    "spiral shocks disappear near the mass accreting star and nearly axisymmetric disc structure is formed .",
    "those flow patterns are quite similar to that obtained in the calculation of adiabatic case with @xmath0 , although the absolute value of density in the disc becomes smaller .    the maximum mach number in the disc is found to be @xmath78 for this case which is the same as that for the case of @xmath0 .    figs .

    "[ fig_3 ] ( d ) shows the temperature distribution with logarithmic scale in a ( quasi ) steady state for the case of @xmath1 with radiative cooling .",

    "the accretion disc exhibits a dual structure , i.e. the significantly cooled outer region and the inner core region where temperature is very high . the precise structure in the inner core region , however , is difficult to resolve with the present mesh system , because the pitch angle of the spiral shocks becomes smaller as approaches to the inner region .",

    "@xmath75 time steps correspond to more than @xmath83 orbital periods . in all the cases ,",
    "the total mass in the mass accreting region becomes almost constant after @xmath84 time steps but begin to oscillate slightly around each mean value .",
    "therefore , we can say that each flowfield in the accretion disc reaches a ( quasi ) steady state .",
    "the total mass for the case accounting for radiative cooling is found to be larger than that for the case of @xmath4 , and smaller than that for the case of @xmath0 . from the results",
    ", we can say that the overall behavior of the flowfield as well as the evolution of the total mass of the adiabatic case with a smaller @xmath6 value is quite similar to the one with radiative cooling shown in the present study . although the precise @xmath6 value can change for case - to - case",
    ", one can conclude that the use of a lower @xmath6 value for simulating radiative cooling effect is almost a valid assumption .",
    "[ fig_5 ]    finally , let us examine the influence of gas properties from the mass losing star . because the process of discharge and absorption of radiation depends on density and temperature of the gas in the accretion disc that is influenced primarily by the gas from the mass losing star , we need to know what are the consequences of changing properties of the gas . fig .",

    "equation ( [ eq - a1 ] ) is discretized as @xmath92 where the superscript @xmath93 denotes the time step .",
    "the factor @xmath94 in the left hand side of the equation ( [ eq - a2 ] ) appears because discharging energy by radiation occurs from the top and bottom surfaces of the disc . except for the radiation energy density @xmath51 ,",
    "the dependent variables are evaluated at time step @xmath93 .",
    "equation ( [ eq - a2 ] ) is solved for @xmath95 .",
    "this @xmath95 is substituted into the discrete form of @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath96 which is further substituted into the energy equation of the euler equations .",
    "this completes the coupling procedure of the flowfield with radiation ."
