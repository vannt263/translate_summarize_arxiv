    "ultracold quantum gases provide a powerful experimental tool to investigate many - body phenomena in quantum systems @xcite .",
    "their distinguished role arises from mainly two facts .",
    "first they constitute clean realizations of microscopic hamiltonians .",
    "for example , whereas a continuum gas of fermions with contact interaction or the ( bose )  hubbard - model are only approximations to solid state systems , they provide realistic descriptions for cold trapped gases",
    ". therefore the latter allow for a direct verification of theoretical predictions concerning these simple microscopic models .",
    "the second important feature of ultracold gases is the possibility to tune the system parameters by application of external fields and to enter the regime of strong interactions with the help of feshbach resonances .",
    "again , this is in clear contrast to e.g. solids , where the parameters are fixed by the sample .",
    "an important and promising direction in cold gases research is the study of strongly correlated systems .",
    "the latter arise on all scales of energy , ranging from high - temperature superconductors to neutron stars , heavy - ion collisions and the phase structure of quantum chromodynamics .",
    "these systems require sophisticated theoretical methods , because mean - field theory and perturbative techniques break down due to the strong correlations .",
    "however , since there is no small parameter , the accuracy of non - perturbative approaches is far from being well understood .",
    "the systematic comparison with experiments could therefore shed light on the reliability of first - principle methods like lattice simulations , the renormalization group , 2pi approaches , extensions of density functional theory , conformal field theory etc .    from our above consideration",
    "it should be clear that ultracold quantum gases provide an ideal basis for such a systematic comparison of theory and experiment .",
    "we are thus lead to an important question : what observables for cold gases reveal advancements and shortcomings of our theoretical treatment of strongly correlated systems ?",
    "the measurement of these quantities will then set stringent bounds on theoretical descriptions and rule out insufficient methods .    in recent experiments ,",
    "the equation of state has proven to be such an observable @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate to what extend collective oscillation frequencies of trapped gases , which can be derived from the equation of state , contain similar or additional information . for a trapped gas",
    "collective modes describe small deviations from static equilibrium .",
    "they typically show an oscillatory behavior with characteristic frequencies .",
    "the number density of atoms in a trap obeys for a particular oscillation mode @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes the equilibrium density profile and we assume small amplitudes , @xmath5 .",
    "we will show how @xmath6 can be calculated for a @xmath2-dimensional trap in the ideal two - fluid hydrodynamic regime for an arbitrary equation of state .    for a gas in equilibrium the equation of state consists in the pressure @xmath7 as a function of two independent thermodynamic variables , e.g. chemical potential @xmath8 and temperature @xmath9 . in situations where local density approximation ( lda ) is valid ,",
    "the equation of state @xmath0 can be extracted from density images of the trapped cloud @xcite .",
    "we will specify the applicability of lda below .",
    "here we mention only that the system has to be considered in equilibrium at each point of the trap separately .",
    "this might seem a strong statement at first sight , but , for sufficiently high densities and strong interactions , experiments have shown lda to be valid at least approximately .",
    "for example , the coefficient of the lee  huang ",
    "yang - correction to the equation of state of a bosonic gas could be measured to good accuracy @xcite .",
    "since the equation of state is obtained from a calculation of the partition function , particular numbers like critical temperature and exponents , or even the whole equation of state @xmath0 over a certain range of @xmath8 and @xmath9 , can be used to verify predictions from many - body theory .",
    "if a theoretical method fails in the context of cold atoms , it might also be questionable in other situations .    for sufficiently low temperatures",
    "ultracold quantum gases can show superfluidity .",
    "then the equation of state consists in two functions , the pressure @xmath0 and the normal fluid density @xmath1 .",
    "again these quantities can be computed from first principles .",
    "the response of a collision - dominated system in thermodynamic equilibrium to a slight perturbation away from equilibrium is completely determined by conservation of mass , energy and momentum .",
    "to first order this response can be computed from ideal hydrodynamics and thus only requires knowledge of the equation of state  an equilibrium quantity . since thermodynamics and thus lda is the static limit of ideal hydrodynamics , the applicability of the latter might also be given for sufficiently high densities and strong interactions .",
    "the question whether the hydrodynamic limit can be reached in experiments is under debate .",
    "however , this regime is very promising from a theoretical perspective because details about the experimental setting become less important .",
    "therefore , already a few quantities like the equation of state or transport coefficients can be used to test theory .",
    "one of the purposes of this paper is to provide an idea how measurements in this regime could look like in future experiments .",
    "if it should turn out to be impossible to reach the ideal hydrodynamic regime of cold gases , our considerations are still valuable as limiting cases of more elaborate treatments .    in the presence of a non - vanishing superfluid density",
    "the ideal hydrodynamic equations have to be modified because the order parameter enters as an additional macroscopic degree of freedom .",
    "the proper two - fluid hydrodynamic equations have been derived by landau .",
    "we propose that collective modes of trapped gases in this regime are an interesting observable in the above sense , i.e. they can be used to test theoretical methods which calculate the equation of state from a given hamiltonian .",
    "the measurement of oscillation frequencies can supplement direct determinations of the equation of state from density images .",
    "in fact , we will show in this paper how the spectrum of collective modes can be computed from the knowledge of the functions @xmath0 and @xmath1 by solving an eigenvalue problem . since thermodynamic derivatives up to second order enter the calculation , insufficient calculations of the equation of state will not yield consistent results for several modes and over wide ranges of external parameters like temperature and particle number . of particular interest",
    "is the behavior of the equation of state at the second order superfluid phase transition .",
    "any observable which is well understood as a function of external parameters like temperature , particle number or chemical potential can , of course , in turn be used to measure these parameters . since the hydrodynamic regime is insensitive to microscopic details , collective modes can yield information about macroscopic properties of the system .",
    "several conditions have to be fulfilled for such an investigation to be reasonable in the first place : the hydrodynamic regime has to be reached in experiment , the equation of state has to be known to sufficient accuracy and the mapping between the equation of state and collective oscillation frequencies has to be understood . contributing to the latter point is the subject of this paper .",
    "collective oscillation frequencies have been a promising observable since the first experiment on trapped cold gases .",
    "therefore , a great amount of literature already exists on measurement @xcite and calculation @xcite of these modes for weakly interacting bose gases , the bec - bcs crossover and other systems at both zero and nonzero temperature .",
    "while earlier work @xcite has partly taken into account additional microscopic properties , we concentrate here on the hydrodynamic approximation .",
    "the main results of this paper are the following .",
    "we derive the eigenvalue problem which determines the hydrodynamic modes for a given equation of state @xmath0 and @xmath1 in a @xmath2-dimensional trap . a numerical implementation based on discretization",
    "is put forward . to be concrete",
    "we consider an isotropic harmonic trap in our calculations .",
    "however , the extension to arbitrary isotropic traps is straightforward , an implementation of anisotropic external potentials requires more numerical effort but is in principle possible .",
    "for a zero temperature bose gas , where hydrodynamics is expected to be valid because the system is completely superfluid , we calculate the correction of the breathing mode beyond mean - field in three and two dimensions .",
    "the equation of state @xmath10 in this case is obtained from non - perturbative functional renormalization group .",
    "we find the expected shift of the breathing mode as a function of the gas parameter in three dimensions and provide a similar result in two dimensions , where the gas parameter has to be defined differently .",
    "we emphasize however that our method is not restricted to the lowest breathing mode , but rather allows to determine the full spectrum of oscillation frequencies including higher dipole , quadrupole , etc . modes .    as a generic example at nonzero temperature we consider a dilute bose gas described by lee ",
    "yang - theory .",
    "we determine the frequencies over a wide range of temperature , varying from low temperatures to the normal regime above the superfluid transition temperature .",
    "although a dilute bose gas is not necessarily expected to fulfill the conditions of hydrodynamics , our method can formally be applied and allows to extract generic features that could arise in spectra of oscillation frequencies .",
    "we discuss the zero temperature limit in the case of a bose gas and find a new set of zero temperature frequencies due to oscillations of the normal atoms which can not be resolved by purely superfluid hydrodynamics of the condensate .",
    "we explain why it is important to measure several frequencies and how this can be achieved with response techniques .    due to the narrow constraints of thermodynamics",
    "the equation of state and thus the collective modes of other systems are expected to show a similar behavior .",
    "particularly interesting is a strongly interacting fermi gas , where , however , the equation of state is not yet known sufficiently , especially below the critical temperature .",
    "further experimental and theoretical progress in this direction will allow for the calculation of the collective modes of a unitary fermi gas as a function of temperature .",

    "indeed , stringari @xcite found the analytic expression @xmath36 , where @xmath17 and @xmath37 are integers .",
    "obviously , no thermodynamic conclusions can be drawn from this formula and it may at best help to determine the trapping frequency when interactions and thermal effects are known to be very small .",

    "we expect formula ( [ 2 - 2b ] ) to be applicable only for sufficiently small values of @xmath17 and @xmath37 , because many nodes or a complicated angular structure may enter in conflict with the assumptions of hydrodynamics .",
    "apparently , for each @xmath44 there is a mode with @xmath45 and frequency @xmath46 which is independent of the equation of state . in particular ,",
    "the lowest dipole mode is exactly at the trapping frequency . up to now",
    "many measurements focused on the breathing and lowest quadrupole mode , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively .",
    "we emphasize that the measurement of two , three or more frequencies could achieve high precision when combined with theory : for a given equation of state an arbitrary number of eigenfrequencies can be obtained by our numerical procedure .",
    "comparison to measurements in well - understood parameter regions tests the ability of a given theoretical method to compute the equation of state accurately . on the one hand",
    ", it will at least give us an estimate on the theoretical errors .",
    "on the other hand , if the agreement is very good , we can take advantage of a non - trivial dependence of the frequencies on thermodynamic quantities like temperature , density , chemical potential or equation of state parameters like @xmath13 .",

    "we have already seen that a system purely described by mean field theory does not show such a behavior .",

    "this simple scaling behavior can be used for very precise measurements of @xmath58 after a proper calibration .",
    "the accuracy of this method is directly related to the accuracy in measuring the frequency shifts . in fig .",

    "this length is given by the typical range of the van der waals potential .",
    "an effective ultraviolet cutoff @xmath75 is necessary in any field theoretic treatment of the system where the contact interaction appearing in the lagrangian of the non - relativistic system is not renormalizable in three dimensions .",

    "it is straightforward to generalize the following treatment to non - vanishing temperatures .    when we include the perturbing potential the linearized equation ( [ 3 - 11 ] ) for the superfluid velocity becomes @xmath479 .",
    "hence the stringari wave equation ( [ 3 - 21 ] ) is now replaced by @xmath480 where we also include damping like in eq .",
    "( [ 2 - 15c ] ) .",
    "the left - hand side of this equation represents the unperturbed oscillator and the right - hand side corresponds to the external driving force . applying a fourier transformation @xmath481 and analogous for @xmath478 we obtain @xmath482 where we defined the operator @xmath483 .",

    "we introduce the scalar product @xmath487 where the integral extends over the cloud .",
    "the operator @xmath160 is then self - adjoint and its eigenfunctions @xmath488 form a complete and orthogonal system .",
    "for @xmath489 we get @xmath490 , where the chemical potential is multiplied by its thermodynamic conjugate , the density .",
    "we assume @xmath491 to be normalized to @xmath130 in the following .    for a perturbing potential @xmath478 ,",
    "the response function @xmath492 is defined as @xmath493 introducing @xmath494 this can be written as @xmath495 the spatial dependence on the coordinate @xmath271 can be eliminated by expanding in the eigenfunctions @xmath488 of @xmath160 , which yields @xmath496 from the equation of motion ( [ e2 ] ) we can immediately read off the response function in this particular basis .",
    "it is given by @xmath497 eq .",
    "( [ e6 ] ) shows that the mode @xmath498 can be excited by applying a periodic perturbation of exactly this spatial form .    for practical purposes we are more interested in the response of the trapped gas to an arbitrary perturbation such that in general several modes will be excited .",
    "let the shape of @xmath184 be given by @xmath499 the variation of the external potential leads to a perturbation @xmath500 of the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "the rate of average energy dissipated is therefore given by @xmath501 where the averaging is over a small interval of time . using @xmath502",
    "this becomes @xmath503    for an oscillating system without spatial coordinate @xmath271 , eq .",
    "( [ e7b ] ) would yield @xmath504 for constant @xmath505 .",
    "if we consider the trapped system as a whole , we can use this analogy to define the response of the cloud to the perturbation @xmath506 .",
    "it has a clear physical meaning related to the dissipated energy .",
    "expanding @xmath507 we arrive at @xmath508 therefore , we have @xmath509 with response coefficients @xmath510    we simplify the situation even further by considering a three - dimensional mean - field bose gas . as we have seen in eq .",

    "we have @xmath520 .",
    "we conclude that a perturbing potential of the form ( [ e8b ] ) has to have the right angular behavior ( @xmath521 ) in order to excite a mode @xmath522 .",
    "this is not restricted to the case of the bose gas but holds in general .",
    "for @xmath523 we find @xmath524 here , we omitted an overall prefactor of @xmath525 .",
    "the response coefficients depend strongly on @xmath194 , i.e. the monomial character of @xmath184 . in particular for low values of @xmath194 there will not be a response from the higher lying modes . for @xmath191 ,",
    "i.e. @xmath526 , none of the collective modes will be excited , for @xmath527 only the breathing mode , and so on .",
