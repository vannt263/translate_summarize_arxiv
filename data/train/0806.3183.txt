    "chaotic maps possess an ergodic behavior which makes them suitable for the design of new cryptosystems .",
    "this is the case of the cryptosystem proposed in @xcite .",
    "this cryptosystem is based on the tent map and has been cryptanalyzed in @xcite and later improved in @xcite . in @xcite a new modification on the original scheme described in @xcite was proposed .",
    "the authors of this new proposal claim that this modification overcomes all the security problems that were emphasized in @xcite . nevertheless , in this paper we show that the ciphertext still includes enough information to enable a chosen - ciphertext attack based on symbolic dynamics .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first of all , sec .",
    "[ section : description ] gives a brief introduction to the cryptosystem under study .",
    "after that , in sec .",
    "[ section : chosen ] the symbolic dynamics based chosen - ciphertext attack is explained .",
    "then some other problems of the cryptosystem under study are discussed in sec .",
    "[ section : weaknesses ] , and finally the last section gives some final comments and conclusions .",
    "the cryptosystem described in @xcite is based on the transformation of chaotic orbits into binary sequences .",
    "these chaotic orbits are generated using a one - dimensional chaotic map defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "if eq .   is iterated @xmath3 times , then a chaotic orbit will be obtained as @xmath4 the authors of @xcite do not explicitly indicate if @xmath5 is also included in the chaotic orbit as the first chaotic state . without loss of generality , in this paper",
    "we will assume that this was included .    finally ,",
    "the binary counterpart ( i.e. , the symbolic dynamics based representation ) of the original chaotic orbit is given by @xmath6 for @xmath7 .",
    "henceforth , the binary sequence @xmath8 is noted as @xmath9 to emphasize its dependency with the initial condition and the control parameter .",
    "the cryptosystem works as follows .",
    "* step 1 ) initialize @xmath10 .",
    "* step 2 ) for the @xmath11-th plain block @xmath12 formed by @xmath13 bits , try to find the first @xmath14-bit segment of @xmath15 which is equal to @xmath12 ; in case a segment is not found , let @xmath16 and repeat this step , which was published as `` @xmath17 '' . ] .",
    "the parameter @xmath18 indicates the maximum number of trials in the searching of @xmath12 through the binary sequence . *",
    "step 3 ) denoting by @xmath19 the number of iterations needed to locate the distinguished @xmath14-bit segment from @xmath20 , output @xmath21 as the @xmath11-th cipher - block .",
    "* step 4 ) set @xmath22 and @xmath23 , . in this paper",
    ", we assume that it is updated in such a way that no segment of a chaotic orbit will be reused for encryption of two continuous plain blocks . ] then go to step 2 until the whole plaintext is exhausted .",
    "the decryption process is simpler than the encryption one . in this case",
    ", the searching process becomes unnecessary .",
    "for the recovery of the @xmath11-th plain block , one simply iterates the chaotic map from the current status for @xmath24 times and record the last @xmath14 chaotic states , which are then transformed into the @xmath11-th @xmath14-bit plain block according to eq .  .    in @xcite",
    "it is claimed that the secret key of the cryptosystem is composed of the initial condition @xmath5 and the control parameter @xmath25 . for a more detailed description of the encryption / decryption procedures ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "in @xcite it is mentioned that most chaotic systems can be used to implement the above described cryptosystem .",
    "moreover , the resistance of the cryptosystem against the attacks presented in @xcite is assumed without any security analysis .",
    "however , this section proves that a wrong selection of the chaotic map allows an estimation of the secret key through a chosen - ciphertext attack .    among all the possible options ,",
    "the logistic map was chosen in @xcite as the chaotic system to prove the reliability of the cryptosystem .",
    "the logistic map is defined as @xmath26    for @xmath27 and @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "the function @xmath29 for the logistic map is a concave function with only one critical point at @xmath30 . for this kind of maps",
    "the binary sequence referred in eq .",
    "can be interpreted as a gray code @xcite . moreover , in @xcite it is shown that the family of gray codes generated using eq .   can be assigned an order according to the initial condition and the control parameter .",
    "the existence of this order allows an estimation of the control parameter @xmath25 and the initial condition @xmath5 just by analyzing the binary sequence @xmath9 for a sufficiently large number @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , as long as one can reconstruct the sequence @xmath9 , one can estimate the secret key of the cryptosystem .",
    "this is used to build an attack with three different stages :    1 .",
    "reconstruction of the gray code derived from the logistic map .",
    "estimation of the control parameter from the reconstructed gray code .",
    "estimation of the initial condition from the reconstructed gray code and the estimated control parameter .",
    "if one has access to the decryption machine , then one can perform a chosen - ciphertext attack @xcite to reconstruct @xmath9 , i.e. , the gray code associated to the values of @xmath5 and @xmath25 that make up the secret key of the cryptosystem under study . to do so , @xmath31 ciphertexts are generated as @xmath32 for @xmath33 . as an example , let us assume that @xmath34 and @xmath35 . in this case , it is satisfied that @xmath36 as a result , if we ask the decryption machine to decrypt @xmath37 , then we obtain @xmath38 .",
    "similarly , the decryption machine will return @xmath39 when the input is @xmath40 , and @xmath41 when the input is @xmath42 .",
    "in other words , the decryption of the first ciphertext returns the first @xmath43 bits of @xmath9 , the decryption of the second ciphertext gives the second set of @xmath43 bits of @xmath9 , and so on .      if the binary sequence ( i.e. , the gray code ) derived from the iteration of the logistic map is known , then it is possible to infer the value of @xmath25 based on the concept of gray ordering number ( gon ) .",
    "the gon was introduced in @xcite as a way to reinterpret the main results of @xcite in a more intuitive way .",
    "the calculation of the gon of a binary sequence @xmath9 involves two steps :    * the binary sequence is transformed into another binary sequence using the next equation : @xmath44 where @xmath45 . *",
    "the gon of the original binary sequence is calculated as : @xmath46    according to @xcite , for any concave unimodal map with critical point equal to @xmath30 it is satisfied that @xmath47    for any value of @xmath25 in @xmath48 $ ] and any value of @xmath5 in @xmath49 $ ] .",
    "furthermore , the function @xmath50 is an increasing function with respect to @xmath25 ( see fig .",
    "3(a ) of @xcite ) .",
    "these two facts are used in @xcite to estimate the value of the control parameter @xmath25 .",
    "first of all , the value @xmath51 , for @xmath52 , is approximated as the maximum value of the @xmath53 of @xmath31 different shift - left sequences obtained from @xmath9 .",
    "afterwards , the monotonic relationship between @xmath51 and @xmath25 is used to obtain an estimation of @xmath25 through a binary search procedure .    in order to test this algorithm ,",
    "some simulations have been carried out .",
    "the parameter estimation errors for @xmath54 are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : parameterestimationerror ] .",
    "different values of @xmath5 and @xmath3 were considered , for a fixed length of the subsequences of @xmath55 . since this method",
    "is based on the approximation of the maximum of @xmath51 through @xmath31 different values , it is expected that the exact value of @xmath25 can not be obtained unless the value @xmath30 is part of the chaotic orbit from which the binary sequence was calculated . moreover",
    ", the characteristic dependency of chaotic maps on the initial condition makes the parameter estimation error depend on the value of @xmath5 , as shows in fig .",
    "[ figure : parameterestimationerror ] . nevertheless , the proposed method allows to obtain an estimation of @xmath25 which implies a considerable narrowing of the key space and which can be further improved through a trial and error strategy , i.e. , a brute force attack on the value of the control parameter in a dramatically reduced key - space .",
    ", different values of @xmath5 and @xmath3 . ]      in this subsection we will assume that we have obtained the exact value of @xmath25 by using the algorithm discussed in the last subsection . indeed ,",
    "when considering the security of a cryptosystem , a partial knowledge of the key must not lead to the determination of the rest of the key ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rule 7 ) .",
    "therefore , even if we were not able to estimate the value of @xmath25 and obtain the exact value through a brute - force attack , the recovery of @xmath5 based on the knowledge of the other subkey @xmath25 would represent a very important flaw of the cryptosystem under study .    as pointed out in @xcite ,",
    "the gon of @xmath9 is a monotonic increasing function with respect to @xmath5 ( see fig .  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "this means that one can obtain the value of @xmath5 through an iterative algorithm similar to that described in the last subsection .",
    "this algorithm was used to estimate the value of the initial condition from which @xmath9 was generated .",
    "different values of @xmath25 , @xmath5 and @xmath3 were considered .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ figure : x0estimationerror ] .",
    "for all analyzed situations , a number of bits greater than @xmath56 implies an estimation error below @xmath57 .",
    "since all the simulations were performed using double precision , this means that the exact recovery of the initial condition is possible .",
    "in this section some other problems of the cryptosystem under study are emphasized .      in @xcite",
    "it is pointed out that most chaotic systems can be used to implement the proposed cryptosystem .",
    "however , there is no indication of the requirements that a chaotic system must fulfill to determine a secure cryptosystem according to the proposed encryption / decryption structure .",
    "moreover , in the previous section we proved that at least a family of chaotic maps , i.e. , the unimodal chaotic maps with fixed critical point equal to @xmath30 can not be used as long as a high level of security against chosen - ciphertext attack is needed .",
    "furthermore , a different way should be used to generate the binary sequence for the encryption procedure . in the original design ,",
    "this binary sequence is obtained by comparing each chaotic state included in a chaotic orbit with the fixed threshold value 0.5 .",
    "nevertheless , to ensure good statistical characteristics of the binary sequence , the threshold value should be selected according to the dynamics of the underlying chaotic system .",
    "the characteristics of a cryptosystem should be precisely defined in order to facilitate its implementation ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rule 1 ) . during the encryption step of the cryptosystem under consideration",
    ", the plaintext is divided into a set of binary sequences @xmath12 which are successively located in the binary sequence @xmath9 .",
    "it is possible that @xmath12 is not included in @xmath9 . in this case , the length of @xmath12 is progressively decreased until it is found in @xmath9 . nevertheless , there is no information about the length of @xmath9 , i.e. , about the maximum number of iterations @xmath18 needed to conclude whether the length of @xmath12 must be decreased .",
    "furthermore , not only the length of @xmath9 is not explicitly established , but also some interpretation problems concerning the precise way of generating @xmath9 can be found .",
    "fist of all , in @xcite it is not mentioned whether the first bit of @xmath9 corresponds to @xmath5 or to @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "once the plain block @xmath12 has been encrypted , it is not clear whether the next binary sequence starts from @xmath59 , @xmath60 or @xmath61 . note that we fixed these problems in our description of the cryptosystem given in sec .",
    "[ section : description ] .",
    "the inadequacy of the logistic map for the implementation of this cryptosystem has been proved by means of a ciphertext attack",
    ". however , the selection of this map entails another important problem that suggests not to choose the logistic map as a base of any cryptosytem @xcite .",
    "this problem concerns the definition of the key space .",
    "in @xcite it is claimed that the value of the control parameter @xmath25 should be selected within the interval @xmath62 to exhibit a chaotic behavior .",
    "however , the existence of periodic windows in this region is well known ( see fig .  [",
    "figure : logbif ] ) and so the selection of @xmath25 should be performed in a more precise manner in order to avoid these ( * ? ? ?",
