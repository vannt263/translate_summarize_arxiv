    "the renormalization - group ( rg ) theory of critical phenomena classifies continuous phase transitions into universality classes , which are determined only by a few global properties of the system , such as the space dimensionality , the nature and the symmetry of the order parameter , the symmetry - breaking pattern , and the range of the interactions . within a given universality class ,",
    "the critical exponents and scaling functions describing the asymptotic critical behavior are identical for all systems .",
    "the three - dimensional xy universality class is characterized by a complex order parameter and symmetry breaking @xmath11 .",
    "an interesting representative of this universality class is the superfluid transition of @xmath0he along the @xmath1-line @xmath12 , which provides an exceptional opportunity for a very accurate experimental test of the rg predictions , because of the weakness of the singularity in the compressibility of the fluid and of the purity of the samples .",
    "exploiting also the possibility of performing experiments in a microgravity environment , the specific heat of liquid helium was measured up to a few nk from the @xmath1-transition.@xcite the resulting estimate of the specific - heat exponent , obtained after some re - analyses of the experimental data,@xcite is @xcite @xmath13 other experimental results at the superfluid transition of @xmath0he , and for other physical systems in the xy universality class , are reported in ref .  .",
    "on the theoretical side the xy universality class has been studied by various approaches , such as field - theoretical ( ft ) methods and lattice techniques based on monte carlo ( mc ) simulations or high - temperature ( ht ) expansions .",
    "a review of results can be found in ref .  .",
    "accurate estimates of the critical exponents were obtained in ref .   by combining mc simulations and ht expansions of improved hamiltonians .",
    "this synergy of lattice techniques provided the estimate @xmath14 which is substantially consistent with the experimental result ( [ expest ] ) , although slightly smaller .",
    "other results obtained from ft calculations,@xcite mc simulations,@xcite and ht expansions@xcite are less precise and in agreement with both estimates ( [ expest ] ) and ( [ theorest ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we significantly improve the theoretical estimates .",
    "this allows us to check whether the small difference between the theoretical and experimental estimates ( [ expest ] ) and ( [ theorest ] ) disappears after a more accurate theoretical analysis , as recently suggested in ref .  .",

    "the precision of the data allows us to observe the expected next - to - leading scaling corrections , and therefore to have a much better control of the systematic errors .",
    "moreover , we extend the ht expansion of the susceptibility and of the correlation length in the @xmath15 and ddxy models to 22nd order , i.e. , we add two terms to the ht series computed and analyzed in refs .  . using this bulk of new data and calculations",

    "we first report the results of fss analyses of mc data up to @xmath8 ( fss ) .",
    "the three reported results for each model are obtained from the analysis ( left ) of a combination of two quantities ( temperature derivatives of rg invariant quantities ) that does not have leading scaling corrections , ( center ) of the energy density , and ( right ) of the fourth - order ( binder ) cumulant of the magnetization .",
    "next , we report the results obtained from the analyses of the 22nd - order iht series at the optimal values of the irrelevant parameters @xmath18 and @xmath19 , biased using the mc estimates of @xmath20 ( mc+iht ) . finally , we show results obtained by requiring the fss and iht analyses to give consistent results for the exponent @xmath21 ( fss+iht ) .",
    "these results come from different analyses of the available mc data and ht calculations .",
    "although they are not completely independent , their comparison represents a highly nontrivial cross - check of the results and of their errors . in fig .  [ summary ]",

    "[ summary ] provide a rather accurate estimate of @xmath9 , which we summarize by taking @xmath22 as our final estimate .",
    "this result significantly improves our earlier estimate ( [ theorest ] ) , but it does not reduce the difference from the experimental result ( [ expest ] ) . moreover , now the errors are so small that their difference appears significant . according to our analyses , values of the specific - heat exponent @xmath23",
    "appear to be highly unlikely .",

    "( [ rcbeta ] ) .    before concluding the section",
    ", we would like to recall three basic assumptions of fss when considering boundary conditions consistent with translation invariance , such as periodic boundary conditions:@xcite    * @xmath120 is an exact scaling field with no corrections proportional to @xmath121 , @xmath122 , etc . ; * the nonlinear scaling fields have coefficients that are @xmath49 independent ; * the analytic background present in the free energy depends on @xmath49 through exponentially small terms .",
    "the theoretical evidence for these three hypotheses is discussed in ref .  .",
    "under these assumptions , there are no analytic @xmath120 corrections .",
    "these assumptions can be verified analytically in the two - dimensional ising model , see , e.g. , refs .   and references therein",
    ". as far as we know , all numerical results reported in the literature are in full agreement with assumptions ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) .",
    "in particular , there is no evidence of @xmath120 corrections to fss .",
    "as we shall see , the fss analysis that we shall present in this paper will provide further support to the fss assumptions , and in particular to the absence of @xmath120 analytic corrections .",
    "in this section we present mc simulations that significantly extend those of ref .  .",
    "the statistics are much larger and we consider larger lattice sizes ( the largest lattice has @xmath123 ) . as we shall see , the new mc data allow us to perform a more accurate fss analysis , achieving a much better control of the next - to - leading scaling corrections , and therefore of the systematic errors related to the subleading scaling corrections .      we simulated the @xmath15 and ddxy models on simple cubic lattices of size @xmath124 with periodic boundary conditions , at several values of the hamiltonian parameters @xmath1 and @xmath16 , close to the optimal values @xmath18 and @xmath19 , at which leading scaling corrections vanish .",
    "most of the simulations correspond to @xmath125 and @xmath126 , that represent the best estimates of @xmath18 and @xmath19 of ref .  .",
    "the basic algorithm is the same as in our previous numerical study reported in ref .  .",
    "we use a combination of local and cluster@xcite updates .",
    "we perform wall - cluster updates:@xcite we flip all clusters that intersect a plane of the lattice .",
    "a cluster update changes only the angle of the variables .",
    "an ergodic algorithm is achieved by adding local updates,@xcite which can also change the length of the spin variables .",
    "we use metropolis and overrelaxation algorithms as local updates , which we alternate with the cluster updates .    the main difference with respect to our previous numerical work @xcite concerns the random number generator .",
    "since we planned to increase the statistics by approximately one order of magnititude , we decided to use a higher - quality random number generator , such as those proposed in ref .  .",
    "in our mc simulations we used the ranlux random number generator with luxury level 2 .",
    "its main drawback is that it requires much more cpu time than the g05caf generator of the nag - library  @xcite which we used in ref .  .",
    "in order to get a good performance , despite the use of the expensive random number generator , we used demonized versions @xcite of the update algorithms , which allowed us to save many random numbers .",

    "in addition , we perfomed simulations at @xmath128 for the @xmath15 model , and at @xmath129 for the ddxy model .",
    "we shall also present some mc simulations of the standard xy model . in total , the mc simulations took approximately 20 years of cpu - time on a single 2.0 ghz opteron processor .",
