    "systems of interacting biological species evolve through the long , slow and intricate process of natural selection @xcite . usually , the result of this process is so complex that the dynamics of such webs of coevolving species can be successfully represented , within relatively short time scales , by means of a dynamical system with stochastic elements @xcite .",
    "a standard mathematical model for the joint evolution of @xmath0 biological species with spatially homogeneous densities @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) is the generalized lotka - volterra system @xcite , @xmath3 \\qquad ( i=1,2, ... ,m ) .",

    "whithin this type of representation , the dynamics of coevolving species can be characterized by statistical properties over different realizations of parameter sets .",
    "there are two biological systems that can potentially involve a large number of coevolving populations .",
    "the first one is an ecological system in which each population corresponds to a different biological species , as usually interpreted in the theory of population dynamics @xcite .",
    "the other situation is a system in which each population represents a genotype accessible to a given species @xcite . in this situation",
    ", the number of populations can be sensibly larger than in the case of interacting species .",
    "although in both cases coevolution is presumably well described by eqs .",
    "( [ volterra0 ] ) , the probability distributions to be assigned to the random parameters @xmath5 , which represent the interaction between populations , are not necessarily similar .",
    "in fact , in an ecological system of several coevolving species , mutual interactions can be of different types ( competition , symbiosis , parasitism ) . within a given species , instead",
    ", it is expected that the interaction is mainly competitive , as in logistic models @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , in a system where many individuals compete for a resource , the dynamics leads to the extinction of some of them and to the survival of others .",
    "this is indeed a basic fact of evolution in the darwinian sense .",
    "though the generalized lotka - volterra model ( [ volterra0 ] ) has been explored in detail @xcite , it seems that a full characterization either deterministic or statistical of the conditions under which a population becomes extinguished or survives in the competition process has not been achieved . in this paper , we aim at analyzing this particular problem from a statistical viewpoint .",
    "we consider a large number of coevolving species or genotypes , each of them consisting of a population of identical individuals with density @xmath1 .",
    "these populations are supposed to evolve according to the lotka - volterra model ( [ volterra0 ] ) , subject to purely competitive interactions , i.e. with @xmath6 for any pair @xmath7 .",
    "since we aim at analyzing the statistical properties of the dynamics , these coefficients will be drawn at random from a given distribution and will remain quenched from the initial time .    for simplicity , we take @xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 @xcite , indicating that in the absence of competition the dynamics of all the populations are identical .",
    "we are thus implicitly identifying these populations with the genotypes accessible to a given species . within this condition",
    "that it is not essential to our interest and could in fact be easily relaxed eqs.([volterra0 ] ) reduce to @xmath11 \\qquad ( i=1,2, ... ,m ) .",
    "\\label{volterra}\\ ] ] all the coefficients @xmath5 will be chosen at random from the same distribution @xmath12 , such that @xmath13 for @xmath14 .    in the next section",
    "we outline the behavior of the dynamical system ( [ volterra ] ) in phase space , showing that its evolution proceeds along a series of `` pseudo - extinctions '' , in which some of the densities @xmath1 can attain very low levels during long periods but , eventually , they recover significative values .",
    "a threshold for these pseudo - extinctions that become consequently true extinctions is suggested by the biological context of the problem .",
    "this threshold is introduced in our numerical study of eqs .",
    "( [ volterra ] ) in section 3 , where we focus the attention on the statistics of extinct and surviving genotypes and try to characterize their long - time behavior in terms of their inital conditions .",
    "our results are discussed in section 4 .",
    "the evolution of the dynamical system ( [ volterra ] ) can be described in terms of a semi - quantitative analysis of the corresponding phase - space topology , which is determined by the fixed points of ( [ volterra ] ) and the associated invariant manifolds .",
    "the equations for the fix - point coordinates @xmath15 read @xmath16 and have , generically , @xmath17 solutions .",
    "in fact , each solution to these equations can be characterized by the number @xmath18 of non - zero coordinates ( @xmath19 ) ; let us call such a solution an _",
    "@xmath18-equilibrium_. for a given choice of the coefficients @xmath5 the number of different @xmath18-equilibria is @xmath20 .",
    "therefore disregarding pathological choices of @xmath5 the total number of fixed points is @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath15 stands for a density , meaningful equilibria among the @xmath17 fixed points are those with non - negative coordinates . in appendix",
    "a it is proven that , for random @xmath5 , the probability that all the non - zero coordinates of an @xmath18-equilibrium ( @xmath22 ) are positive is @xmath23 we stress that it is essential to this result that @xmath24 @xmath9 @xmath7 , i.e. that the system is purely competitive . for large @xmath0 , the number of equilibrium points with non - negative coordinates will therefore be approximately given by @xmath25 it is interesting to note that , if @xmath26 @xmath9 @xmath7 , all the non - negative equilibria will be confined to a certain volume @xmath27 in phase space , since @xmath28 .",
    "this volume shrinks rapidly for growing @xmath0 , as @xmath29 , and the density of equilibrium points most of which are situated on the surface of @xmath27 , where some of the coordinates vanish grows correspondingly .",
    "the stability properties of the fixed points of system ( [ volterra ] ) can be fully analyzed in some very special cases only .",
    "for instance , as could be expected for this logistic - like dynamical system , the @xmath30-equilibrium ( @xmath31 @xmath9 @xmath10 ) can be proven to be always unstable . moreover , for a random choice of positive @xmath5 , @xmath32-equilibria are stable with probability equal to @xmath33 .",
    "finally , the @xmath0-equilibrium ( @xmath34 @xmath9 @xmath10 ) is stable if @xmath5 is a symmetric matrix .",
    "though we can not give a detailed characterization of the stability of all of the @xmath18-equilibria , it can be argued that , for a random system and for large @xmath18 and @xmath0 , the eigenvalues of the linearized problem should follow a semicircular distribution @xcite .",
    "a typical equilibrium point is thus linearly unstable and it has approximately the same number of positive and negative eigenvalues .",
    "correspondingly , the number of unstable and stable invariant manifolds for each equilibrium is more or less the same . since the mathematical structure of system ( [ volterra ] ) prevents both the divergence of orbits and changes of sign in the densities @xmath1 , the invariant manifolds of positive equilibria are necessarily bounded and mutually connected , defining homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits .",
    "most of these orbits lie on the surface of the volume that contains the positive equilibria , where some of the densities are exactly equal to zero .    in summary ,",
    "the portion of the @xmath0-dimensional phase space of system ( [ volterra ] ) meaningful to our problem is populated by a large set of fixed points of the order of @xmath35 in number most of them having positive and negative eigenvalues , i.e. being unstable .",
    "they are confined to a volume of order @xmath36 and , typically , are found on the surface of such volume .",
    "these equilibria are highly interconnected through invariant manifolds which lie also on that surface and connect stable and unstable eigenvectors .",
    "the number of those manifolds should be of order @xmath37 .    with these elements in hand , the evolution along a typical phase - space trajectory of the dynamical system ( [ volterra ] )",
    "can be outlined as follows . from a generic initial condition",
    ", the orbit should soon approach one of the stable manifolds , and the system will be driven towards the corresponding equilibrium .",
    "it will spend some time in the vicinity of this equilibrium , but if this fixed point is not stable ( i.e , if it has at least one unstable manifold , which as we have argued is the typical case ) the orbit will finally leave that neighborhood , just to be drawn along one of the unstable manifolds of this first equilibrium point towards another equilibrium , that is expected to have in turn some stable and some unstable manifolds . the whole process will repeat itself and the system will wander in phase space , typically visiting the neighborhoods of a large number of unstable fixed points , until it eventually finds a stable equilibrium .",
    "this is reminiscent of the complex behavior of boolean evolution models on random landscapes @xcite , which in contrast with lotka - volterra models are however discrete ( in space and time ) and stochastic .",
    "we stress that , in wandering from one equilibrium to another , the orbit is expected to approach more and more the successive invariant manifolds that drive the dynamics of the system @xcite .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the system will spend longer and longer periods in the immediate vicinity of those equilibria .",
    "since , typically , the equilibria have some null coordinates , the corresponding densities will approach a vanishing state but as the system escapes from each unstable equilibrium point they can eventually recover appreciable values .",
    "as the evolution proceeds , a given density can therefore practically vanish during a rather long time , but can then increase and become again significative in the whole dynamics .",
    "we shall come back to these pseudo - extinctions in the next sections , to discuss their relevance in the numerical study of the system and its biological interpretation .",
    "finally , it is worthwhile to remark that the existence of a stable equilibrium point , able to definitively attract an orbit , is in principle not guaranteed .",
    "moreover , even if one or several stable points do exist , it is not insured that their bassins of attraction cover the whole space of initial conditions .",
    "the system could thus perform a chaotic orbit or become trapped in a limit cycle @xcite .",
    "we have performed an extensive numerical investigation of system ( [ volterra ] ) .",
    "each realization consists of the numerical integration of the equations , after a random choice of the interaction matrix and the initial conditions . in all the results presented here , the interaction coefficients @xmath5",
    "have been randomly chosen from a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath38 $ ] , with @xmath39 , but we have tested that other probability distributions always defined for @xmath40 produce essentially the same results .",
    "similarly , the initial densities have been uniformly distributed at random in the interval @xmath41 $ ] .",
    "a proper rescaling of densities and time makes it possible to fix , without generality loss , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the only parameter to vary in these distributions is therefore @xmath44 . in the following",
    "we describe the dynamical behavior of ( [ volterra ] ) as drawn from our numerical calculations .      in figure 1",
    ", we show the evolution of several typical densities in a system of @xmath45 genotypes , for @xmath46 .",
    "note that , to ease the appreciation of certain details , both the time and the density axis are logarithmic . in the inset",
    "the same curves are shown in a semilogarithmic plot , with logarithmic time axis .",
    "the phenomenon of pseudo - extintions is clearly seen in some of the curves . we have checked that , in some realizations , one or more densities can temporarily attain values as small as @xmath47 , and then grow to levels of the order of their initial values .",
    "the verification that pseudo - extinctions do occur as predicted , in the previous section , from our analysis of the phase space structure points the attention to a further ingredient , which is not present in the model as described by ( [ volterra ] ) , but has to be necessarily taken into account in a system where the variables are , actually , discrete .",
    "in fact , the population density of a species or a genotype confined to certain spatial domain @xmath48 of volume @xmath49 can not be smaller than @xmath50 , unless it vanishes . in a description in terms of densities , it is therefore necessary to fix a threshold @xcite , below which the only value accessible to the density is effectively zero .",
    "besides this biological argument for introducing a density threshold , we must stress that in our numerical calculations this element is also necessary to avoid spurious effects of finite computer precision on the results .",
    "a threshold @xmath51 has been thus introduced as an additional parameter in the numerical calculations , in such a way that if a density attains a value lower than @xmath51 it is automatically set to zero .    from the analytical viewpoint",
    ", it can be argued that the introduction of a threshold changes the stability of almost all the @xmath18-equilibria .",
    "roughly speaking , whereas without threshold an orbit could approach an equilibrium following a stable manifold just to leave it along an unstable one , with threshold the system can instead be `` captured '' by the equilibrium point if the orbit crosses the threshold .",
    "what was an unstable equilibrium becomes , in effective terms , a stable one .    in order to illustrate the different behavior of systems with and without density threshold , we have chosen to analyze the evolution of the total density @xmath52 as a global characterization of the phase space dynamics .",
    "figure 2 displays the evolution of @xmath53 for two systems of 100 species . in both cases",
    "the interaction is defined by @xmath54 .",
    "one of the curves corresponds to the system without threshold ( besides that imposed by the smallest representable number in the computer ) .",
    "the other one corresponds to the same system with the same initial conditions and interaction matrix with a threshold @xmath55 .",
    "note that the time scale is again logarithmic .",
    "it can be seen that , in this realization , the orbit of the first system follows the qualitative behavior described in the previous section .",
    "it passes near some equilibria where @xmath53 remains practically constant spending exponentially larger and larger times in their neighborhood .",
    "when a threshold is present , the system is always attracted to one of the new `` stable '' equilibria . in the case of fig .",
    "2 , the system is captured at @xmath56 by an equilibrium point that , although being unstable in the first case , acts now as a stable fixed point for this orbit .",
    "according to our simulations , the main feature in the long - time dynamics of system ( [ volterra ] ) with or without threshold is that it evolves to a situation in which most of the densities vanish at finite times if @xmath57 or asymptotically if @xmath58 .",
    "this behavior can be identified with the extinction of the corresponding genotypes . in any case , for a large system , a variable number of surviving populations is found at long times . in fig .",
    "3 , we show the distribution of the number of surviving populations for different values of @xmath59 .",
    "each curve was constructed from the results of 2000 realizations in a system with @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the final time in each realization was chosen so that a stationary state had been reached , which was checked to be a solution to eqs .",
    "( [ fix ] ) .",
    "the distribution of the number of surviving populations is generally a bell - shaped curve , its width and maximum depending on the probability distribution @xmath12 .",
    "it can be seen in fig .",
    "3 that for @xmath62 small enough the curve is relatively broad , and that wider interactions reduce the overall stability of the system , leading to a shift of the curve towards a situation where less species survive .",
    "the correlation between the maximum of the distribution of survivors and the width of @xmath63 is shown in the inset , in a log - log plot .",
    "observe that for the smallest value , @xmath64 , the maximum of the distribution coincides with the total number of species in the system .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that the probability of having a non - negative @xmath18-equilibrium , @xmath65 ( cf . section 2 ) , is also a bell - shaped curve as a function of @xmath18 .",
    "this fact should however be considered only as indicative of the profile of the curves in fig .",
    "3 . in fact",
    ", the probability that an initial condition approaches any @xmath18-equilibrium depends not only on their number for a given @xmath18 but also on the size of their bassins of attraction , about which our phase - space analysis provides no information .",
    "a very natural question arises now , yet not easy to answer : which populations survive ?",
    "are they characterized by some particular initial condition , by some peculiarity in the interaction with the remaining populations ? in the study of a real ecological system , it would be desirable to give an answer to these questions in terms of quantities accessible from observations .",
    "it is thus reasonable to consider , since they are probably the easiest to measure , the initial densities and their initial time derivatives . besides being accessible",
    ", these quantities characterize the initial interactive scenario : according to eqs .",
    "( [ volterra ] ) , the density measures the effects of each population on itself , while its first time derivative accounts for the influence of the remaining species .",
    "we have found that an answer based on deterministic arguments can not be given to such questions .",
    "according to the statistics collected from the simulations , we conclude that only a weak correlation exists between survival and the initial conditions .",
    "this correlation can be evidenced by calculating the distribution of final densities as a function of the initial one , providing thus a probabilistic answer to those questions . in figs . 4 and 5 we show ( full lines ) the distribution of survivors as functions of initial values , for general asymmetric systems ( @xmath66 ) . fig",
    "4 shows that the probability of survival is almost uniform in the whole range of initial densities , with a slighty higher probability of survival for the largest ones . in fig .",
    "5 an associated distribution is shown : the number of survivors as a function of the initial derivative of the density . here",
    ", an enhancement of the probability of surviving is seen around a relatively large ( and negative ) value of the initial time derivative .    we have also found that this correlation between the final state and the initial condition is stronger in symmetric systems ( @xmath67 ) . in figs . 4 and 5 ,",
    "the same functions are shown as dashed lines for symmetric systems . in this case",
    ", there is an enhancement in the probability of survival for those species that start with a higher initial population .",
    "although considering a purely symmetric interaction matrix is irrelevant from the biological point of view , these results suggest that the statistical correlation between initial and final states and , in particular , between initial conditions and survival probability can depend in a rather strong manner on additional constraints in the interaction matrix .",
    "we have analyzed a dynamical system that represents the evolution of many species coupled by lotka - volterra interactions . the study has been restricted to systems where the interaction is purely competitive .",
    "this dynamical system describes , in principle , two different biological systems .",
    "the first is an idealized ecological system of interacting species . to represent more realistic ecological systems , the connectivity of the model",
    "should be built correspondingly , typically , with several levels of preys and predators .",
    "on the other hand , the model can also describe the system of genotypes present in , or accessible to , a single species or population . within a single species",
    ", the number of competing genotypes can be much larger than the number of competing species in an ecological niche .",
    "of course , not all of them strive and result finally expressed in the living population , and this is precisely the problem we have addressed in this work .",
    "we have found that the evolution of the system follows complicated orbits in phase space .",
    "these orbits drive the system from the neighborhood of one of the many equilibria to another , regardless of their stability . systems with a finite population threshold , that may represent more accurately real biological systems , eventually fall into a stable equilibrium situation . as time elapses ,",
    "a variable number of populations become extinct through the interaction with the others . in general , more than one species survive , in contrast with the `` principle of competitive exclusion '' @xcite ( that is known to be of limited validity ) .",
    "the number of surviving ones those that finally reach equilibrium is characterized by a bell - shaped distribution , whose width and maximum depend on the distribution of interactions .",
    "besides competition , a population of genotypes is also subject to changes that arise from random mutations and recombination during the reproduction of the organisms @xcite .",
    "the description of such a system would require a modification of model , whose behavior can not be predicted _ a priori_. mutations can be easily taken into account by allowing a new interaction , namely random transitions between the genotypes @xcite .",
