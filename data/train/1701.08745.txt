    "the study of the parallel upper critical field in thin films continues to be an area of research as seen in the work on amorphous pb films@xcite and a s / f bilayer,@xcite both of which discussed the prediction by v. kogan on a possible enhancement of superconductivity in thin clean superconducting films in applied parallel magnetic fields.@xcite this prediction was not seen in the theoretical work by scotto and pesch@xcite and later by hara and nagai@xcite on thin superconducting films .",
    "hara and nagai in particular made predictions on the parallel critical field slope for thin superconducting films in parallel magnetic fields as a function of film thickness and resistivity , but to our knowledge , this result has not been experimentally verified . in this work",
    "we compare the predictions of hara and nagai for superconducting niobium films in the moderately dirty limit , and will see what happens when the film is below the critical thickness predicted by kogan .",
    "the initial work by v. kogan@xcite claimed that an enhancement in the @xmath1 would take place for parallel field for films less than the critical thickness , @xmath2 , given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the elastic mean free path , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the zero field critical temperature , and @xmath8 is given by @xmath9    scotto and pesch s work@xcite carefully considered the parallel upper critical field for films with varying thicknesses and mean free paths .",
    "their work was primarily a numerical study , but showed that kogan s critical thickness did not exist .",
    "hara and nagai@xcite working with the theory of scotto and pesch , considered the slope of the parallel critical field near the zero field critical temperature . from their work the parallel critical field near @xmath7 can be written as @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16film thickness/@xmath17 .",
    "( in the paper by hara and nagai , they used @xmath18 . ) hara and nagai showed that @xmath19 is negative definite for all values of film thicknesses and mean free paths .",
    "with all the theoretical exploration of this topic , it was hoped that comparison to actual measurements might be made to see which model best fits the data .",
    "the niobium films were produced by magnetron sputtering onto substrates from a 99.95% pure nb target in uhp ar at a pressure of 133 mpa .",
    "background pressures in the system were typically 4 @xmath20pa , with ln@xmath21 cooled surfaces near the substrates to remove water vapor .",
    "films were typically grown at either room temperature or with the substrate stage heated from behind by quartz lamps to a temperature of 300 c , as measured behind the substrate stage .",
    "measurements of the substrate temperature show they are typically at 230 c under these conditions .",
    "growth rates were typically 8 nm / min , with the samples rotated during deposition to improve uniformity both from a thermal and deposition viewpoint .",
    "substrates were either ( 100 ) silicon or a - plane and c - plane sapphire .",
    "the substrates were either used as provided or cleaned with a rca-1 process.@xcite film thicknesses were based off reference samples that were measured by stylus profilmeter at the ien lab in georgia tech and we assign a 5% uncertainty to those values . for the samples here , film thicknesses varied from 16 - 54 nm .",
    "all samples had their resistivity measured by the van der pauw technique.@xcite the samples were mounted to an ofhc copper platform cooled by a cryocooler down to a base temperature of 6 k. a magnetic field up to 0.7 t could be applied to the sample , and the angle of the field could be varied from perpendicular to parallel to the film surface .",
    "upper critical field measurements were made at constant field , with the temperature swept from above to below the transition , typically at 0.1 - 0.2 k / min .",
    "the critical temperature for the applied field was defined by the midpoint of the transition .",
    "field orientation to the sample was determined by measuring the transition at constant temperature and sweeping field up for various angles to find the maximum field and therefore determine the parallel field orientation .    in order to compare to the predictions of hara and nagai",
    ", we have to take our measured values of @xmath7 and @xmath22 ( the electrical resistivity at 10 k ) into the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "this was done using standard values for the electronic coefficient of specific heat for niobium ( 7.8 mj / mole / k),@xcite an average fermi velocity for niobium@xcite of 2.7@xmath25 m / s and using the equations from orlando _",
    "et al._@xcite    one complication that has to be addressed is the strong coupling correction needed for niobium , which is not included in the work by hara and nagai . from the work in orlando _",
    "et al._@xcite and known values of the energy gap for niobium , the strong coupling term for the upper critical field for our films is @xmath26 .",
    "but we also know from the work by orlando that @xmath27 and since in the tinkham theory for parallel critical field , @xmath28 , it would seem that in a plot involving @xmath29 we should only adjust the slope by one power of @xmath30 , however with the full theory it is not completely clear how to bring in strong coupling .",
    "it was decided to use just one factor of @xmath30 in the @xmath29 plots .",
    "some samples were characterized by x - ray diffraction , both along the growth direction and in plane , using cu k@xmath31 radiation .",
    "niobium films typically grow with the close packed plane ( 110 ) along the substrate with fiber texture ( i.e. , no in - plane order ) . however , our film with the highest value of rrr = 7.8 , or @xmath24=2.2 show surprising results .",
    "xrd along the growth direction again showed ( 110 ) along the growth direction , however the film also showed finite thickness fringes , consistent with the known film thickness of 23 nm , as seen in fig .",
    "in addition , scans along various angles showed the film does have in - plane texture , as the pole plot in fig .",
    "[ xrd]b demonstrates .",
    "the behavior of this film is consistent with that seen in the work by zhao _",
    "et al._@xcite on energetically condensed niobium .",
    "the difference here is that this film is grown at a much lower substrate temperature without the additional energetics , so to our knowledge this is the lowest temperature nb film grown by sputtering that shows in - plane order .",

    "in fig . [ para_perp ] we show the upper critical field for a 48 nm nb sample with the field perpendicular ( @xmath32 ) and parallel ( @xmath33 ) where @xmath34 is the angle between the applied magnetic field and the sample surface .",
    "we see the expected linear behavior for the perpendicular field , and what looks like the expected square root behavior of the parallel field .",

    "we can extract the value of @xmath7 used in the analysis .",
    "the slope of the curve was then used to extract @xmath19 as described below .",
    "this analysis was done for the 18 films used in this study .",
    "all films in this study showed negative slopes for plots such as this , including two films that each had @xmath40 .",
    "these films , both grown on a - plane sapphire , were 23 and 16 nm thick , with rrr of 7.8 and 4.1 , and had critical thicknesses from kogan s prediction of 30 and 17 nm , respectively . with both samples having thicknesses below @xmath2 , and both showing slopes of @xmath38",

    "the films in this study span a range of @xmath16film thickness/@xmath17 from 0.4 to 1.5 , with @xmath24 varying from 2.2 to 14 , which is consistent with the range in the work by hara and nagai .",
    "the analysis for all films was as follows .",
    "first the data was plotted as @xmath38 vs @xmath29 to find the relevant data and extract the value of @xmath7 . to get the measured value of @xmath19 , a plot of @xmath11 vs @xmath29 was created .",
    "the slope of this plot was then divided by @xmath30 to remove the strong coupling and then divided by @xmath44 to give @xmath19 .",
    "all linear fits were done accounting for uncertainties both in temperature and field using linefit.@xcite    in fig .",
    "[ c21 ] we show the comparison between the calculated and measured values of @xmath0 vs @xmath24 for a series of films that have @xmath45 .",
    "we have included a 5% uncertainty in both the value of @xmath24 and the calculated values of @xmath0 , due to the uncertainty of thickness mentioned earlier .",
    "the uncertainties in the measured values of @xmath0 are due to the uncertainties due to the linear fitting of @xmath46 vs @xmath29 .",
    "we observe that there is a systematic trend with the experimental values of @xmath0 being lower than theoretical . if we compare values of @xmath0 for all our films , as seen in fig .",
    "[ c22 ] , we again see a systematic trend with experimental values lower than theoretical .",
    "the discrepancy still remains if we instead correct the strong coupling by using @xmath47 although the experimental values follow the general trend of the calculated values , there is a continual disagreement on specific values .",
    "it is not clear to us at this point what could be causing the discrepancy .",
    "surely there is an issue on exactly how to correct for strong coupling , and there has been no consideration for the effects of niobium s non - spherical fermi surface , which would come about from the averaging over the fermi surface done in the work by hara and nagai to evaluate the value of @xmath0 .",
    "we have carried out the first test of the work by hara and nagai on parallel critical fields .",
    "we find there is a systematically lower value of the slope of @xmath48 vs @xmath29 for our niobium films compared to what the theory would predict .",
    "we see no evidence of the predicted enhancement of @xmath41 by kogan .",
    "we have also seen extremely good in plane order for niobium films grown at a very low substrate temperature , @xmath49 230 c.     @xmath0 vs @xmath50 for niobium films with @xmath23 = 0.62(2 ) .",
