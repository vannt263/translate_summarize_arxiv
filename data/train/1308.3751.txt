    "since the launch in march 2009 , the _ kepler _ mission has discovered a few thousand planetary candidates , called kepler objects of interests ( kois ) , by detecting the flux deficit as a planet transits in front of its star @xcite . while some of the stars are observed to have one transiting planet ( called  tranet  from now on , following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , others show up to 6 @xcite . a natural question to ask is , do all of these systems share the same intrinsic orbital structures ? for observing transiting planets ,",
    "the two most relevant orbital parameters are the dispersion in orbital inclinations , and the typical spacing between adjacent planets .",
    "a number of groups have studied the inclination dispersion of kepler planets and reached the common conclusion that this must be small and is of order a few degrees @xcite .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that models with a single inclination dispersion falls short in explaining the number of single tranets relative to higher multiples , by a factor of three or more @xcite .",
    "this suggests that all kepler planets are not the same , and motivates models where the inclination dispersion itself is broadly distributed (  rayleigh of rayleigh  , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , the relative occurrences of different kepler multiples ( denoted here as 1p , 2p , 3p ... by the number of tranets seen in a system ) are sensitive to both the inclination dispersion and the intrinsic planet spacing",
    ". larger spacing between adjacent planets will raise the relative number of single tranet systems , as so will larger inclination dispersion .",
    "it is difficult to disentangle the two without the aid of further information .",
    "therefore we turn to a new measure , the ttv fraction .",
    "if a tranet is accompanied by another planet , its transit times deviate from strict periodicity ( transit - time - variation , ttv , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many studies have used ttv to confirm the planetary nature of kepler candidates .",
    "furthermore , it is realized that when the companion is near a mean - motion resonance ( mmr ) with the tranet , the ttv is particularly strong and exhibits a characteristic sinusoidal form @xcite .",
    "the amplitude and phase of this sinusoid have been simply related to the perturber s mass , as well as the orbital eccentricities @xcite , thereby allowing us to infer the interior composition and orbital parameters of these objects @xcite .    just as the ttv signal can be used to infer the presence of unseen ( non - transiting ) companions around specific candidates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the number of tranets that exhibit sinusoidal ttvs provides constraints on near - mmr companions . since the period ratios of adjacent kepler pairs do not much prefer mmrs @xcite , these near - mmr companions can be taken as a proxy for companions that lie close to and inward of the 2:1 mmr .    to be quantitative",
    ", we shall define the `` intrinsic ttv fraction '' as half the probability that a planet induces a sufficiently large ttv amplitude for detection in another planet in the system .",
    "the reason for the factor of a half is that when one planet has a large ttv , then typically so does its ttv partner , and we do not wish to double - count such a pair .",
    "when trying to measure this quantity observationally , we shall first count the number of observed tranets with measured ttv s , and then subtract one each time two tranets are ttv partners . dividing by the total number of tranets yields the `` measured ttv fraction , '' which is our estimate for the intrinsic fraction .",
    "our ability to measure ttv is affected by the noise level in the transit signals , which is in turn determined by a range of parameters including stellar brightness , the size of the planet relative to its host star , the orbital period and the transit duration . however , if we split the planet candidates into different groups , and if these groups share the same noise properties , then one can argue that the relative ttv fractions measured for different groups represent the relative differences in their intrinsic ttv fractions .    in the following ,",
    "we proceed to measure the relative ttv fractions among 1p , 2p , 3p and 4p+ systems , where 4p+ stands for systems that have four or more transiting planets .",
    "we carry out the analysis for all kois that have suitable light - curves , which include more than 2600 kois .",
    "we interpret the significance of our results in  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we use the publicly available q0-q12 long cadence ( lc , pdc ) data for 2740 kois ( kepler objects of interest , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . out of these",
    ", 134 kois have fewer than 7 transit time measurements , either because the transit periods are very long , or the signal - to - noise ratios ( snr ) are too small .",
    "these spread evenly across all multiplicities .",
    "this leaves us with 2606 kois , out of which there are , 1488 , 571 , 320 , 227 systems that are designated as 1p , 2p , 3p and 4p+ , respectively .",
    "we refer to this sample of 2606 kois as the ` full ' sample .",
    "we have also selected a ` reduced ' sample by excluding those kois for which timing measurements are less accurate .",
    "these include those with large noise ( @xmath0 ) , and short transit duration ( less than an hour ) .",
    "we include only kois with intermediate planet sizes ( @xmath1 ) as they likely have the lowest false positive rate @xcite .",
    "this reduced sample contains a total of 1989 kois , with 1097 , 446 , 253 , and 193 systems designated as 1p , 2p , 3p , and 4p+ , respectively .",
    "the pipeline used to measure the transit times has been developed and described in @xcite .",
    "we compare our transit time measurements to the published ones @xcite , and found good consistency ( see , e.g. , fig.[fig : ttv ] ) .",
    "our measurements for the ttv candidates are publicly available at http://www.astro.utoronto.ca/@xmath2jwxie/ttv .      from the above transit time measurements , we derive ttv , which are the residuals after a best linear fit .",
    "we then search for a sinusoidal signal by obtaining a lomb - scargle ( ls ) periodogram @xcite on these residuals and identify the highest peak that has a period longer than twice the orbital period , as well as @xmath3 days .",
    "the former threshold comes about because twice the orbital period is the nyquist frequency for sampling ttv .",
    "the latter threshold is enforced because ttv at shorter periods can be significantly polluted by noise from chromospheric activities , as stellar rotation periods fall typically in the range from a few to a few tens of days @xcite .",
    "sinusoidal ttv caused by a perturber near a mmr has a `` super - period '' @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the orbital periods of the two planets that are near a first - order @xmath7 mmr by a fractional distance @xmath8 . for a planet pair with period @xmath9 days , @xmath10 , @xmath11",
    ", we find @xmath12 days .",
    "a planet pair with a larger @xmath13 will have a shorter super - period , however their ttvs also become increasingly difficult to detect as the ttv amplitudes scale inversely with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "all reported cases @xcite have @xmath13 falling between @xmath14 .",
    "this consideration , coupled with the above concern for chromospheric noise , leads us to discard sinusoids short - ward of 100 days .",
    "we also adopt an upper limit of @xmath15 days .",
    "this comes about because the data ( q0-q12 ) stretch only @xmath16 days .",
    "however , some ttv systems show strong , identifiable sinusoids even before a full ttv cycle is observed . this constraint is later relaxed and",
    "is found not to impact the conclusion .",
    "many of the sinusoids thus identified are false , caused by random alignment of noisy data .",
    "it is an important task to exclude these .",
    "we adopt the following strategy from @xcite , originally applied to detect planets from radial velocity data . for each koi , we scramble the time stamps of the original ttv data for @xmath17 times , perform a ls periodogram analysis on each set of data , obtaining the amplitude and frequency on the highest peak .",
    "the fap ( false alarm probability ) of the original ttv peak is estimated as the fraction of permutations that have higher sinusoids than the original ttv .",
    "we assign an fap value of @xmath18 if not a single random realization exceeds the observed sinusoid amplitude .",
    "our fap estimates compare well with those from @xcite .",
    "fig.[fig : pttv ] shows the fap and @xmath19 for each of the kois in our full sample , as well as those using a scrambled time series for the same kois .",
    "the latter set is equivalent to random noise and so acts as a control sample .",
    "the true data show a significant excess of objects at very low faps , when compared to those of the scrambled data .",
    "we adopt the following ` standard ' criterion ( the region labelled as ` s ' in fig .",
    "[ fig : pttv ] ) for identifying our ttv candidates :    * \\(1 ) @xmath20 and * \\(2 ) ttv period between 100 and 1000 d.    objects that have fap @xmath21 exhibit ttv amplitudes that range from one to hundreds of minutes , with ttv sensitivity higher for larger snr objects . our above fap criterion",
    "is on the conservative side : for an fap of @xmath22 , there should only be @xmath23 false positives among our ttv candidates , much fewer than the actual number of candidates ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "we experiment by relaxing the above criterion , either by raising the fap threshold to @xmath25 ( adding the ` f ' region in fig .",
    "[ fig : pttv ] ) , or by removing the 1000 day upper limit ( adding the ` p ' region ) .",
    "we report our results below .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath26 see  [ sec : method ] for definitions of various samples and ttv thresholds .",
    "the ` reduced ' sample is selected based on snr , transit duration , and luminosity ; the s , p , and f criteria are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : pttv ] . + @xmath27 number of identified ttv candidates , versus numbers of kois in that category .",
    "the numbers in parentheses are the raw ttv candidates , while the the corrected ones after parentheses result from removing one of the two ttv candidates from the count whenever a ttv pair is seen .",
    "+ @xmath28 the measured ttv fraction using the corrected ttv count .",
    "we observe a remarkable rise of the ttv fraction with transit multiplicity .        in table 1",
    ", we list the number of ttv candidates for different transiting multiplicities , for four different combinations of sample and ttv selection criteria .",
    "for ease of comparison against theory , we list the `` measured '' ttv fractions , obtained by removing one candidate from the raw count whenever both it and its ttv partner have observed ttvs .",
    "such a method is justified in ",
    "[ sec : discussion ] . from now on , we focus on these `` measured '' fractions ( illustrated in fig . [ fig : frac ] )  in fact , we focus on the relative `` measured '' fractions , the ttv fractions normalized by that in 4p+ systems .",
    "the choice for the normalization is arbitrary .",
    "however , since the errorbars for these relative fractions are taken to be quadratic sums of the individual errorbars , which type of system one normalizes against does not affect the statistical conclusion .",
    "these results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : frac ] .    except for case 3 ,",
    "all other combinations give very similar results for the relative ttv fractions : 1p systems have about five times lower ( values from case 1 : @xmath29 ) ttv fraction than 4p+ , and 2p and 3p systems are about twice lower ( @xmath30 , and @xmath31 ) .",
    "results from case 3 are less reliable as the ttv selection criterion is too relaxed and allows for too many false positives .    we have also used the ttv data from @xcite , published while we are editing our final draft , to confirm the above results ( fig . [",
    "fig : frac ] ) .",
    ", we plot ttv fractions from their catalog ( their table 3 ) after applying our ` s ' selection criterion .",
    "the good agreement is encouraging , as we extract ttvs using a different method . ]",
    "we first discuss what potential bias may affect the absolute ttv fractions that we obtain , then move on to discuss biases that may affect the relative ttv fractions among groups of different transit multiplicity .",
    "it becomes clear that by focusing only on the relative ttv fractions , we can eliminate many , if not all , observational bias .",
    "we compare properties of the set of ttv candidates against the koi sample .",
    "the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig_dis_ttv ] display four transit properties : signal - to - noise ratio , planet radius , orbital period and transit duration .",
    "the ttv sample have in general larger transit snr , larger planet radii ( disfavouring small planets ) and slightly longer transit durations than the average kois .",
    "in addition , they are also concentrated around orbital periods @xmath32 days .",
    "these characteristics allow for optimum ttv detections , as is demonstrated in recent ttv studies by @xcite .",
    "for instance , longer orbital periods generally lead to larger ttv amplitudes @xcite , yet too long orbital periods permit only a small number of transits to be observed . as such , we expect that the intrinsic ttv fraction , quantified as half the fraction of planets that have comparable ttv amplitudes as the ones detected here , should be higher than our reported values ( table 1 ) .",
    "on the other hand , we find no significant difference between the ttv and koi samples in terms of stellar mass , effective temperature , metallicity and stellar brightness ( stellar parameters from * ? ? ?",
    "ks tests performed to compare these two populations always return p - values greater than @xmath33 .",
    "this suggests that ttv candidates live in all possible systems .",
    "however , this deserves further study as currently there are large uncertainties in stellar parameters , and our ttv sample is relatively small .    while the ttv sample as a whole are a biased representation of the koi sample , we find that the different sub - samples , separated by their transiting multiplicity , share similar distributions in both the transit parameters ( fig.[fig_dis_ttv ] ) and the stellar parameters ( not shown here ) .",
    "the large p - values returned from ks tests ( fig.[fig_dis_ttv ] ) do not support the hypothesis that the different subgroups experience different selection effects .",
    "moreover , we have confirmed that our reduced koi samples , when separated into groups of different transit multiplicities , are statistically similar in their transit and stellar parameters .",
    "since the ability to detect ttv above a certain threshold amplitude , only depends on these transit and stellar parameters , these two results then argue that the relative measured ttv fractions reflect the relative intrinsic ttv fractions . in other words ,",
    "the significant correlation between ttv fraction and transit multiplicity that we observe ( fig.3 ) is unlikely to be caused by systematic biases on stellar / transit parameters .",
    "another potential bias could arise during transit detection  transiting planets with significant ttvs can be systematically missed , or cataloged as false positives by the kepler pipeline @xcite . to remove this bias , @xcite designed an algorithm ( qats ) that can simultaneously detect transits and measure their ttvs .",
    "searches using qats have only found a handful of new planetary candidates ( private communication j. a. carter ) , which might indicate that the kepler catalogue is not significant impacted by this bias .",
    "nevertheless , we caution that there could be another possibility , namely , the qats could not fully remove the bias , which deserves further study but is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "last but not least , we note that the transit multiplicity of a given system is evolving as the catalog updates . for example , a 1p system may become a 2p system when a new transit candidate is found , either due to accumulation of new data and/or improvement of the pipeline / algorithm for planet detection . to see how these factors affect our results",
    ", we took an older version koi catalog from @xcite and performed the same analysis as done in the standard case ( case 1 in table 1 ) .",
    "we obtained similar results for the relative ttv fractions : ( @xmath34 , ( @xmath35 , ( @xmath36 and ( @xmath37 for the 1p , 2p , 3p and 4p systems , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the correlation between ttv fraction and transit multiplicity observed in fig .",
    "3 may remain unaffected as more improved catalogues are published .",
    ", satisfies a rayleigh distribution @xmath38 , and where the planets mutual inclinations are described by an independent rayleigh distribution with @xmath39 .",
    "the results presented here are insensitive to the value of @xmath40 .",
    "we identify ttv planets as those that transit their host stars and have a companion within a fractional distance of @xmath41 from a first - order mmr .",
    "the solid lines indicate the measured fractions , while the dotted lines are the raw fractions ( i.e. , the fraction before removing doubly - counted ttv pairs ) , plotted as functions of @xmath42 , for different multiplicity groups .",
    "the raw fractions in the 1p systems can drop to half of that in the 4p systems , because one is likely to observe both planets in the same ttv pair in the latter case .",
    "in contrast , in the corrected form ( our so - called measured ttv fraction ) , the relative ttv fractions remain close to unity , and are largely independent of either transit multiplicity or model parameters . in contrast , the observed relative fractions ( case 1 in fig . [",
    "fig : frac ] , marked here as arrows ) fall much below unity .",
    ", scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we discuss the significance of our results by contrasting them against predictions from a simple toy model .",
    "assume all kois , independent of transit multiplicity , are drawn from the same intrinsic distribution , with similar dispersions in mutual inclinations and planet spacing ( with no preference for mmrs ) . in this case , single systems are the ones where the viewing angles are less favourable and we miss most of the planets in the system , while the higher multiples are ones where more planets are caught .",
    "one can estimate the ttv fraction for the theoretical population as half the fraction of planets that both transit and have companions within a certain distance from a first - order mmr .",
    "as one naively expects and as is confirmed by monte carlo simulations ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ttv_toymodel ] ) , the relative ttv fractions cluster around @xmath43 , and are largely independent of the model parameters and transit multiplicities .      the lower ttv fraction observed for singles is unlikely to be completely explained by the higher false positive rates in koi singles .",
    "the reported false positive rate is of order @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "more importantly , our reduced sample , which is expected to have a lower false positive rate than the full sample , yields the same relative ttv fractions . moreover , since ttv amplitudes are strongly boosted by eccentricities as small as a few percent @xcite , the lower ttv fraction can be explained if higher multiple systems have higher eccentricities .",
    "however , this is likely excluded by the tight spacing observed among high multiples .",
    "a simple explanation for our results is that the basic assumption in our toy model is not true , namely , all kois can not be treated as the same intrinsic population @xcite .",
    "for example , there could be at least two distinct populations of kepler planets , different in their intrinsic frequencies of close companions .",
    "the high multiples ( 4p+ ) are dominated by a population that has a higher companion frequency , while the 1p systems may be dominated by a population that have a lower frequency of close companions . in other words",
    ", there are at least two populations of kepler planets , one that are closely spaced , and one that is sparsely spaced . in an upcoming publication",
    ", we will use ttv fractions obtained in this paper , together with a variety of other observational facts , to constrain the properties of these two populations of kepler planets .",
    "this will yield important constraints on the process of planet formation .",
