    "a deep irac image , or a more sensitive observation with future missions may be helpful in unambiguously determining if e0102 does emit at 8 @xmath0 m .",

    "it is likely the infrared ejecta are denser , cooler ejecta than the optical ejecta . in the future , the infrared and optical data should be combined to more accurately estimate of the ejecta mass , because a wide range of ionization states are observed in the remnant .",
    "however , it will be more meaningful to combine them within similar resolution images , since the ejecta knots have very small scales not only in optical but also in infrared as shown in the case of cas a @xcite .",

    "in addition to the standard cases , we have calculated models with ram pressures that are larger by a factor of 1.5 , 2 and 3 and with smaller magnetic field strengths , down by a factor of 2 .",

    "matching the line ratio requires lower shock speeds which in turn leads to more flux .",
    "this problem can be overcome if the emission is clumped on scales unresolved by _ spitzer_. table [ table : tlineflux ] uses the default angular extraction size ( 10@xmath2320  for ll ) to estimate the surface brightness , because the snr structures were not resolved .",

    "the total mass of oxygen in the irs aperture is thus inferred to be 0.26 m@xmath13 .",
    "the calculated mass is quite sensitive to the second component temperature , however .",
    "for example , a temperature of 7000 k rather than 9100 k reduces the o mass a factor of two .",
    "the uncertainty in the estimated oxygen mass may thus be a factor of a few . to obtain the total oxygen mass for the entire remnant we scale the masses above by the same 3.30 multiplicative aperture correction factor used for ne .",

    "note that oxygen mass estimate is much less accurate than that of ne because we only have one observed oxygen line .",
    "it is evident that the infrared census of the ne and o ejecta mass is incomplete because the ejecta that emit at optical and x - ray wavelengths are more ionized and at higher temperatures .",

    "the total neon and oxygen masses that we estimate from the infrared observations and shock models are compared to the nucleosynthesis yields of massive stars in @xcite , @xcite , and chieffi & limongi ( 2003 ) as summarized in table [ yields ] .",

    "these mass estimates , however , are subject to uncertainties in the composition of the underlying continuum . @xcite make their mass estimate assuming that the ejecta do not include light elements , but if this is not the case , @xcite note that the x - ray derived ejecta mass could be a factor of 20 lower , at 0.1 and 0.3 m@xmath13 , for ne and o , respectively . by comparison , our estimates for the ne and o ejecta masses from the infrared observations are 0.042 m@xmath13 and 0.78 m@xmath13 , respectively . in the optical / uv analysis of @xcite , relative line strengths and shock models",
    "favor a progenitor of 25 m@xmath8 , but no attempt is made to estimate ejecta masses for the entire remnant .",
    "if we take the lower set of values for the x - ray emitting ejecta masses , we determine the total ejecta mass determined from the combined infrared and x - ray analysis to be @xmath120.142 m@xmath8 for ne and @xmath121.08 m@xmath13 for o. taking the higher x - ray values , these masses are 2.04 m@xmath8 for ne and 6.8 m@xmath8 for o. as a comparison , the x - ray emitting ne mass predicted by our shock model is @xmath20.84 m@xmath13 , though we note that this model was matched to the infrared ne line emission only . taken together , the inferred ejecta masses favor a progenitor mass of 30 ( 25 - 40 ) m@xmath13 as shown in figure [ armass]a and table [ yields ] , but are not strongly constraining .",
    "the infrared ne / o mass ( @xmath120.13 ) ratio by itself favors a progenitor mass greater than 25 m@xmath8 , as do the total masses of ne and o when we take the lower range of the x - ray emitting ejecta mass corresponding to the presence of light elements in the ejecta .",
    "this is not surprising given that the infrared ejecta mass makes up a significant fraction of the total mass ( 30% for ne , and 70% for o ) if the x - ray ejecta masses are taken to be at this lower limit .",
    "contrariwise , the infrared emitting masses make up a very low fraction of the total ejecta mass ( 2% for ne and 12% of o ) if we take the higher x - ray ejecta masses corresponding to pure heavy elements , and the inferred progenitor mass is then necessarily in agreement with that obtained in the x - ray analysis by @xcite .",
    "the set of line - emitting ejecta elements is very different for e0102 and cas a , although both are young core - collapse snrs with optical emission from high - velocity o ejecta . in e0102 ,",
    "the ar lines are apparently absent in the infrared , and the si and s lines are weak .",
    "cas a , by contrast , shows very strong ar emission as well as strong silicate ( 21 @xmath0m - peak ) dust emission ( see the comparison in table [ tcompe0102casa ] ) .",
    "in addition , cas a shows unshocked , centrally located si and s ejecta , whereas e0102 shows no indication of any unshocked ejecta .",
    "the differences in the x - ray line emission from these two remnants are in line with those seen in the infrared .",
    "e0102 is dominated by o and ne @xcite , while cas a is dominated by si , s , ar , ca , and fe .",
    "the ejecta temperatures in cas a are higher , and presumably the o is too ionized to emit appreciable line emission , although cas a is also subject to much higher interstellar absorption . and in spite of being considerably younger than e0102 ( at an age of 330 yr ) , cas a has a reverse shock that is already traversing the innermost ejecta layers .",
    "the key to this difference may be the extensive mass loss experienced by the cas a progenitor , which probably had a binary companion ( young et al . 2006 ) .",
    "cas a is likely to have exploded at only 4 m@xmath8 after having started at @xmath225 m@xmath8 on the main sequence ( e.g. , laming & hwang 2003 ) .",
    "this difference in the mass loss history of the progenitors would also affect the supernova nucleosynthesis and subsequent evolution of the remnant .",
    "it is thus possible that the explosion of e0102 simply did not produce a significant mass of ar .",
    "certainly , variations of factors of 5 - 20 in ar mass are evident in various supernovae ( for example , see the comparison of sn 2005af to sn 1987a and sn2004dj in @xcite ) .",
    "nucleosynthesis models likewise predict a wide range of ar masses , with more massive progenitors producing significantly more ar .",
    "the yields range from 0.001 to 0.07 m@xmath13 for 25 - 40 m@xmath13 progenitors , with corresponding ar / ne mass ratios of 0.001  0.1 ( figure [ armass ] ) .",
    "if we scale the predicted ar / ne mass ratios to the total infrared ne ejecta mass of 6.5@xmath100 m@xmath13 , the models predict an infrared - emitting ar mass between 6.5@xmath103 to 6.5@xmath101 m@xmath13 .",

    "moreover , because of the differences in dust composition assumed , there are differences in the absorption coefficients used and also in the inferred density ; the latter are generally higher for the grains we used here , with mgsio@xmath6 , and al@xmath7o@xmath6 having solid - state densities of 3.2 and 2.45 g  @xmath4 , respectively , compared to more typical ism grains , e.g. , graphite with @xmath108 = 2.25 g @xmath4 .",
    "our estimated dust mass is also higher than those generally inferred for supernovae .",
    "possibly , it is easier to detect dust in young snrs than in extragalactic sne simply because the dust in sne is too cold to be detected in the infrared by _ spitzer _ , whereas the freshly synthesized dust in young snrs has been heated by the reverse shock to observable temperatures .",
    "another limitation for estimating the dust mass of extragalactic sne is that the spatial resolution currently available with ir telescopes for observing supernovae is still poor , and that makes it difficult to distinguish between fresh dust formed in the ejecta and ism / csm dust . in the case of e0102",
    ", we were able to resolve and separate the ejecta and the forward shocked materials , and found no significant infrared emission from the ism heated dust .",
    "the estimated total dust mass of 0.007 to 0.015 m@xmath13 for e0102 is a factor of 3 lower than the mass ( from 0.02 to 0.054 m@xmath13 ) of cas a @xcite , though of the same order of magnitude .",
    "we discuss a few possibilities for the discrepancy between our estimated dust mass from e0102 and the dust mass per sn predicted by models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to account for the dust in high red - shifted galaxies .",
    "first , there may be more mass in dust at lower temperatures .",
    "our wavelength coverage is only up to 40 @xmath0 m , and the mips 70 @xmath0 m  emission has not been detected due to confusion with the nearby h  ii region of n76 and the limited spatial resolution of the 70@xmath0 m  image , as shown by @xcite .",
    "we could not constrain a temperature of 41 k with our irs data , as shown in model c of table [ tbestfit ] . even if colder dust ( @xmath10955 k ) exists , our observations would not be sensitive to it .",
    "the colder dust components have been detected in cas a and kepler ( dunne et al . 2009 ; gomez et al . in preparation ) suggests that they could be present in other snrs .",
    "second , there are large uncertainties in dust destruction rates .",
    "the dust mass of cas a may explain the lower limit on the dust masses in high redshift galaxies , when assuming conservative dust destruction rates @xcite .",
    "when a more moderate destruction rate is taken account , a much higher dust mass per sn is needed to explain the dust in the early universe @xcite . the grain disruption which occurs primarily in sn - shocks",
    "is known to be too efficient to explain the amount of dust in the ism @xcite . however , new infrared observations of sn 1987a suggest that the destruction rate of the silicate grains is a factor of 2 smaller than previous values @xcite , and that micro - sized grains can survive the passage of a sn shock wave @xcite .",
    "third , an inaccurate estimation of progenitor masses from ejecta could cause the discrepancy , since the imf of massive stars is rather steep . as discussed in  4.5 ,",
    "progenitor mass depends on accurate estimates of ejecta masses over a broad range of wavelengths .",
    "fourth , if e0102 contains fe - bearing dust , the dust mass would be higher because the density of fe dust ( @xmath108 = 7.95 ) is three or more times higher than other grains . since fe dust ( due to the shape of q@xmath110 ) is featureless like carbon and similar to that of al@xmath7o3 at low temperatures ( @xmath22 100 k ) , it is difficult to distinguish between fe , c and al@xmath7o@xmath6 . while we assume no fe dust because fe gas lines are not detected , a small contribution of fe could significantly increase the dust mass .",
    "fifth , some grain types may be larger than assumed , which would increase the inferred mass .",
    "sixth , smaller - sized dust in the ejecta is preferentially destroyed behind the reverse shock as demonstrated by @xcite ; in the case of e0102 , this has been ongoing for 1000 yrs .",
    "deep observations with future telescopes , in particular , far - infrared / submm observations and theoretical models of the time evolution of dust that is formed in the ejecta would be needed to settle this issue .",
    "using _ spitzer _ irs and irac , we have carried out a study of the infrared emission from dust and ejecta in e0102 .",
    "our results may be summarized as follows :    \\1 .",
    "we have detected infrared emission from e0102 in both continuum and lines .",
    "these include bright lines of [ ne   ii ] ( 12.8 @xmath0 m ) , [ ne  iii ] ( 15.5 @xmath0 m ) , [ o  iv ] and/or [ fe  ii ] ( 26 @xmath0 m ) [ o  iv ] and/or [ fe  ii ] ( 26 @xmath0 m ) , weak lines of [ ne  v ] ( 14.3 @xmath0 m ) , [ ne  v ] ( 24.3 @xmath0 m ) , and [ ne  iii ] ( 36 @xmath0 m ) , and possibly [ sii ] , [ siii ] ( 33.5 @xmath0 m ) , [ siii ] ( 34.89 @xmath0 m ) .",
    "the ejecta in e0102 are dominated by ne and o in the infrared , as in the x - ray and optical .",
    "the ]  lines are broadened by 20 -100 % above the instrumental resolution , implying a true velocity dispersion of about 2000 - 4500 km s@xmath1 .",
    "this is comparable to velocities measured for the optically emitting ejecta , and indicates that the infrared ]  emission is also from ejecta .",
    "the density of the infrared - emitting ne ejecta is high .",
    "the collisionally excited line diagnostics using ]  and ]  line ratios imply that ]  lines come from a low ( @xmath2600 k ) temperature and [ ne v ] lines from high density region . a shock model with a best velocity parameter of 200 km",
    "s@xmath1 indicates that the ] lines mainly come from the cooling zone , which is hotter dense region , whereas [ ne  ii ] and [ ne  iii ] lines are mainly from the photoinization zone with a cold temperature of 400 - 1000 k.    \\4 .",
    "we detect a broad dust feature at 18 @xmath0 m , that we attribute to mgsio@xmath6 and si ; the remainder of the dust continuum can be fitted with either carbon or al@xmath7o@xmath6 grains .",
    "the spatial correspondence of the dust continuum and the ejecta lines indicates that the dust is freshly formed in the ejecta .",
    "the continuum show strong correlation with ejecta of e0102 , showing that dust has formed in the ejecta .",
    "we estimate a dust mass of @xmath111 to 0.015 m@xmath8 that is higher than previous estimates by an order of magnitude , but smaller than that of cas a.    \\6 .",
    "we estimate the mass of infrared - emitting ne and o ejecta .",
    "we estimate infrared emitting ne ejecta mass of 0.014 m@xmath8 and a total ne mass of 1.26 m@xmath8 derived from the best shock models . together with the x - ray masses ,",
    "these imply a progenitor mass of @xmath230 m@xmath8 .    for the future ,",
    "detailed modeling to obtain accurate ejecta masses for young remnants such as cas a and e0102 will be helpful to understand the production of elements such as ar deep in the ejecta and their physical conditions in the remnant .",
    "more broadly , the goal is to understand the progenitors and the explosions that produced these remnants .",
    "infrared observations with _ spitzer _ and _ iso _ have allowed us to identify dust features in snrs and sne including cas a and e0102 .",
    "however , the presence of cold dust , which can be only identified in the far - infrared and submm , is still uncertain due to limited angular resolution at these wavelengths . in the near - future",
    ", we expect _ herschel _ observations will significantly advance our knowledge of cold dust .",
    "sensitive observations will be very helpful to find and study the ejecta , so deep infrared mid- and near - infrared observations with _ spitzer _ and with future missions such as jwst will significantly advance our understanding of the questions of nucleosynthesis and dust formation in supernova explosions .",
    "we thank haley gomez for insightful , helpful comments on the manuscript .",
