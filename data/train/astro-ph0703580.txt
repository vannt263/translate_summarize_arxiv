    "polarization of starlight is one among a number of properties manifested by interstellar dust grains .",
    "wavelength dependence of polarization , for instance , can give information on the size distribution of grains towards different galactic directions .",
    "polarization is thought to be caused by the same dust grain responsible for the reddening of starlight .",
    "according to davis and greenstein mechanism ( davis , 1951 ) , the polarization of starlight is caused by the selective extinction due to the elongated dust grains aligned in space possibly due to magnetic field .    in order to investigate the distribution and characteristic of dust grains",
    ", we have selected the young open cluster ic 1805 .",
    "the reddening law is anomalous in this direction and the extinction is non uniform over the cluster region ( sagar 1987 ; borgman 1961 ; johnson 1968 ; ishida 1969 ; turner 1976 ) .",
    "the polarimetric components produced by the galactic dust located in front of the cluster can be found out from maximum polarization @xmath1 and colour excess @xmath2 ( marraco 1993 ) . by removing the effect of dust located on the line of sight from the data",
    ", one can study the component associated with the internal extinction of the cluster .",
    "the young and rich open cluster ic 1805 @xmath9 is the core of the casob6 association .",
    "it is located in the perseus spiral arm , radially outward from the local spiral arm .",
    "ic 1805 is situated in a hii region and embedded in w4 molecular cloud .",
    "the colour excess @xmath10 for the cluster members varies from 0.52 to 1.3 mag ( joshi & sagar 1983 ) . from the near - ir study of ic 1805 , sagar ( 1990 )",
    "found that the distribution of dust and patchy ionized gas appear to be the cause of non uniform extinction across the cluster face .",
    "the relative proper - motion cluster membership study was done by vasilevskis ( 1965 ) in a field of about @xmath11 square degree , centered on the o type giant vsa 148 for 350 stars with a mean error of @xmath12/century . sanders ( 1972 ) revised these membership probabilities by applying the maximum - likelihood method .",
    "the recent estimation of cluster distance is @xmath13 kpc ( joshi & sagar 1983 ) , though the earlier estimate varies from 1.6 to 2.5 kpc .",
    "the previous polarimetric study on ic 1805 was carried out by guetter ( 1989 ) , for 24 member stars brighter than visual magnitude of @xmath14 12 mag . in order to study details about the grain alignment and particle size distribution",
    "we have observed 32 member stars ( nine star common with guetter 1989 ) brighter than visual magnitude of @xmath14 15.5 mag in ic 1805 .",
    "the next section describes the details of instrumentation , observation and data reduction while the main results are given and discussed in the remaining part of the paper .",
    "the aries imaging polarimeter ( aimpol ) consists of a half wave plate ( hwp ) modulator and a beam - splitting wollaston prism analyzer placed in the telescope beam path to produce ordinary and extraordinary images in slightly different directions separated by about @xmath15 .",
    ".5 cm    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ _   +   +   + _ _    figure 4 shows the galactic distribution _ (",
    "l , b ) _ of all the observed stars in the ic 1805 . we have used open circles for all the observed stars and filled circles for the selected _ frontside _ stars .",
    "figures 5a and 5b show the colour excess @xmath2 plotted as a function of galactic longitude @xmath16 and latitude @xmath17 respectively , filled circles for the selected _ frontside _ stars and open circles for the other members .    in order to model the effect of foreground extinction",
    ", we fit the colour excesses @xmath2 for the all nine _ frontside _ stars to a plane ( _ l , b _ ) .",
    "the final equation of the fit is    @xmath18    with an rms error of the unit weight of 0.05 .",
    "the variation of the excesses with galactic longitude @xmath16 is the most significant part of the marraco s model ( marraco 1993 ) . the observed , modeled and _",
    "intracluster _ values of the colour excesses for the _ non - frontside _ stars are listed in table 4 .",
    "it can be mentioned that the modeled value of the frontside excess led to very small values of the _ intracluster _ excess .",
    "the weighted mean of @xmath6 for nine _ frontside _ stars is @xmath19 this value is quite similar to guetter ( 1989 ) for the cluster ic 1805 ( @xmath20 ) .",
    "moreover , this value does not differ more from the _ intracluster _ value of @xmath6 @xmath21 .",
    "these values are very close to the mean interstellar value of @xmath6 0.56 @xmath22 0.04 @xmath23 m ( serkowski 1975 ) .",
    "therefore , we can conclude that the characteristic particle size distribution as indicated by the polarization study of stars in ic 1805 is essentially the same as that for the general interstellar medium .",
    ".5 cm    in case of polarization , the weighted mean of maximum polarization @xmath1 for nine _ frontside _ stars is @xmath24 and the weighted mean of maximum polarization @xmath1 for the cluster member is @xmath25 .",
    "so , there is also no vast difference between _ frontside _ and _ intracluster _ polarization , the contribution of the _ intracluster _ material on polarization is @xmath14   @xmath26 .",
    "the weighted mean of the polarization position angle @xmath27 for nine _ frontside _ is @xmath28 .",
    "it is possible to calculate @xmath29 and @xmath30 , the mean value of normalized stokes parameters for the group of nine _ frontside _ stars . subtracting this mean value from individual @xmath31 and @xmath32 for the rest of the observed members of ic 1805 and inverting the procedure",
    ", we obtained the values of @xmath1 for _ intracluster _ medium and list them in table 4 .    in diffuse interstellar medium the polarization efficiency ( ratio of the maximum amount of polarization to visual extinction ) can not exceed the empirical upper limit ,    @xmath33    which is obtained for interstellar dust particles ( hiltner 1956 ) .",
    "the ratio @xmath34 mainly depends on the alignment efficiency , magnetic strength and also the amount of depolarization due to radiation traversing more than one cloud with different direction .",
    "figure 6 shows the relation between @xmath1 and colour excess @xmath2 for the members and @xmath35 stars of ic 1805 . except the @xmath36 star-170 ,",
    "no star lie at the left block of the interstellar maximum line .",
    "though , the @xmath35 star-170 falls at the left block of the interstellar maximum line , but the value of @xmath37 for the star-170 is 0.63 ( unit weight error of fitting of serkowski polarization relation [ eq.(5 ) ] ) , which is much below than the limiting value 1.6 .",
    "so , there is very less possibility of having intrinsic polarization in star-170 .",
    "the polarization efficiency plot for the members of ic 1805 indicates that apparently the stars are not affected by intrinsic polarization .",
    "the dominant mechanism of polarization in the observed section of ic 1805 is supposed to be the alignment of grains by magnetic field , in a similar way as that found in the general interstellar medium .",
    "the main results of the @xmath0 polarimetric study of ic 1805 can be summarized as follows :    the mean value of maximum polarization @xmath1 of ic 1805 , for foreground is @xmath38 and while for the @xmath39 medium is @xmath40 .",
    "the contribution of the _ intracluster _ dust on polarization is @xmath14  @xmath41 .",
    "the mean wavelength dependence of polarization @xmath6 for the cluster member is @xmath42 and for foreground is @xmath43 .",
    "the very less dispersion of @xmath6 indicates that the mean _ intracluster _ grain size is quite similar to general interstellar medium .    though the observed polarization of some of the stars in ic 1805 may be due to intrinsic stellar polarization in their measurements , but the dominant mechanism is polarization due to the general interstellar medium .",
    "the difference between foreground and _ intracluster _ colour excess is negligible in the direction of ic 1805 .",
    "there is very little evidence of dust in the _ intracluster _",
    "the highly polarized and reddened stars may be projected through various discrete foreground clouds , which have different grain sizes and compositions .",
