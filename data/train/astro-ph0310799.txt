    "in recent years , deep hi  surveys of nearby spiral galaxies , viewed at different inclination angles , have been obtained to study the gas outside the plane of the disk .",
    "edge - on galaxies have been used to investigate the vertical distribution and rotation velocity and face - on galaxies to study the distribution in the plane and the vertical motions .",
    "the pioneering study of the edge - on galaxy ngc891 ( swaters , sancisi & van der hulst 1997 ) revealed an hi  halo ( @xmath415% of the total hi  mass ) extended up to 5 kpc from the plane and having a mean rotation velocity 25@xmath2100 km s@xmath3  lower than that of the disk .",
    "this velocity gradient has also been observed in the ionized gas ( e.g.  ngc5775 ; rand 2000 ) .",
    "more recently , detection of extra - planar hi  has been reported for other edge - on systems such as the superthin galaxy ugc7321 where there is also the indication of a rotation velocity gradient ( matthews & wood 2003 ) .",
    "several studies of face - on galaxies have shown the presence of high velocity gas complexes and of holes in the hi  distribution ( e.g.  hoii , puche 1992 ) . in some cases the high velocity gas",
    "is associated with the hi  holes ( e.g.  m101 , kamphuis , sancisi & van der hulst 1991 ) and thus possibly caused by star formation activity . in others , it is probably due to accretion of material from the intergalactic medium ( e.g.  van der hulst & sancisi 1988 ) .",
    "ngc2403 is a non - interacting ( sc ) spiral galaxy , very similar to m33 and located at a distance of about 3 mpc .",
    "deep hi  observations with the vla ( fraternali et al .",
    "2002a ) have revealed the presence of a gas component with anomalous kinematics , not expected for a thin disk ( figure1 ) . the anomalous hi  in ngc2403 forms a thick ( scale - height@xmath41@xmath23 kpc ) layer with a mass of 3 @xmath5 10@xmath6 @xmath7 ( 1/10 of the total hi  mass ) and a mean rotation velocity 20@xmath250 km  s@xmath3 lower than that of the gas in the disk .",
    "it is the analogous of the hi  halo found by swaters et al .",
    "( 1997 ) in ngc891 .",
    "part of the anomalous gas , located in the inner parts of the galaxy , shows large non - circular motions with projected differences of up to 150 km s@xmath3  from rotation ( 300 km s@xmath3  if it is moving vertically ) .",
    "high velocity complexes are also observed outside the bright optical disk , the most remarkable being an 8 kpc long filament with a mass of about 10@xmath8 @xmath7 .",
    "the halo gas in ngc2403 also shows the indication of a radial infall ( of 10@xmath220 km  s@xmath3 ) towards the centre of the galaxy ( fraternali et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the origin of the anomalous gas in ngc2403 is uncertain .",
    "it may be explained by a galactic fountain mechanism ( shapiro & field 1976 ) .",
    "the discovery of hot , diffuse , x - ray emitting gas with @xmath9 ( fraternali et al .",
    "2002b ) seems to support this interpretation .",
    "however an external ( accretion ) origin can not be excluded .",
    "ngc891 is a nearby ( sbc ) spiral galaxy seen almost perfectly edge - on ( i@xmath1088.6@xmath1 ; rupen et al .",
    "it is located at a distance of 9.5 mpc and it is considered very similar to the milky way . a recent hi  study of this galaxy has shown the presence of an extended hi  halo rotating more slowly ( 25@xmath2100 km s@xmath3 ) than the disk ( swaters et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "we have re - observed ngc891 with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) with about 200 hrs of integration ( oosterloo et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "the high sensitivity and long integration of these new observations have permitted the detection of hi  gas at distances of about 10@xmath215 kpc from the plane .",
    "figure 2 shows a comparison between the total hi  map of ngc891 published by swaters et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and the one produced with the new wsrt data .",
    "our new observations are about a factor 5 better in sensitivity and reveal an hi  layer much more extended in the vertical direction ( about @xmath52 ) while the on - plane size is almost unchanged .",
    "swaters et al .",
    "have modelled the hi  layer of ngc891 and excluded the possibility that the extra - planar gas could be produced by a warp along the line of sight or an imperfectly edge - on orientation of the system .",
    "our modeling analysis confirms these results .",
    "moreover we have made a more detailed study of the halo gas . in figure 3",
    "we show the observed channels maps of ngc891 ( right hand column ) compared with several models of the hi  layer .",
    "the flare model ( column 1 ) shows the effect of an increase of the hi  scale - height ( up to fwhm@xmath46 kpc ) in the outer disk .",
    "the corotating halo model ( column 2 ) is a 2-component model formed by a thin disk plus a thicker disk ( fwhm=6 kpc ) , comprising about 20% of the total hi  mass , with the same rotation curve as the disk .",
    "these two models fail to reproduce the thin channels at high rotation velocities ( 275.5 and 308.5 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "the other three models are made with 2 components : disk and lagging halo .",
    "the halo has a constant rotation velocity of 185 km s@xmath3(about 35 km s@xmath3  lower than the disk ) . in the lagging flare",
    ", the extra - planar gas is mainly located in the outer parts of the disk , and in the other two models it has a distribution ( in r ) similar to that of the gas in the thin disk . in the last model ( column 5 )",
    "the halo gas also has a radial infall motion ( of 20 km s@xmath3 ) , similar to that found in ngc2403 .",
    "all the models with lagging halos are acceptable with some preference for models in column 4 and 5 .    from this analysis",
    "we can conclude that the extra - planar hi  in ngc891 is rotating more slowly ( mean velocity of about 35 km s@xmath3 ) than the gas in the plane .",
    "it is distributed in a thick ( fwhm@xmath46 kpc ) layer with a radial profile similar to that of the disk . moreover , the data are consistent with a radial inflow of halo gas toward the centre of the galaxy .",
    "ngc6946 is a nearby scd spiral galaxy , viewed at an inclination angle i@xmath1130@xmath1 and located at a distance of 5.9 mpc .",
    "it has been studied in hi  by kamphuis ( 1993 ) and this revealed an extended hi  disk ( about twice the size of the optical ) and the presence of several hi  holes .",
    "ngc6946 has recently been re - observed in hi  with the wsrt ( boomsma et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "figure 4 shows the total hi  map obtained from these new data , the ellipse outlines the area inside r@xmath12=5.5@xmath13 .",
    "the hi  disk is extended far beyond the optical radius out to @xmath413@xmath13@xmath1122 kpc .",
    "the hi  distribution clearly shows a spiral pattern and numerous holes , mostly confined to the inner ( bright optical ) part of the disk .",
    "high velocity gas is detected all over the disk of ngc6946 , in some cases associated with hi  holes . in figure 4",
    "( right panel ) we show a position - velocity diagram taken roughly along the major axis ( indicated by the line on the total hi  map ) .",
    "this diagram illustrates the variety of features which are detected in ngc6946 .",
    "there is clearly anomalous ( halo ) gas similar to that found in ngc2403 .",
    "however , in this case , part of the anomalous gas is also observed on the high velocity side of the diagram ( showing the presence of vertical motions ) .",
    "moreover , in ngc6946 clouds at very high velocity are observed ( see the one at projected velocity of 150 km s@xmath3 ) .",
    "surprisingly , some of these are detected outside the bright optical disk ( boomsma et al .",
    ", this conference ) and seem therefore not to be related with star formation .",
    "the study of spiral galaxies viewed at different inclination angles is needed to reconstruct the 3d distribution and kinematics of the halo gas .",
    "the three galaxies shown here are good complementary candidates for such a study .",
    "what we learn about the halo gas from these three studies can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "* distribution : * spiral galaxies have thick components ( halos ) of hi  gas with typical fwhms of a few kpc .",
    "hi  clouds are detected up to distances of 10@xmath215 kpc from the plane of the disk ( ngc891 ) .",
    "the typical mass of the hi  halo is about 10@xmath220% of the total hi  mass of the galaxy .",
    "the typical masses of individual clouds are a few 10@xmath14 @xmath7 , very similar to some of the hvcs in the milky way ( e.g.  complex a , van woerden et al .",
    "* overall kinematics : * the halo gas is rotating more slowly ( 20@xmath250 km s@xmath3 ) than the gas in the plane .",
    "the difference in rotation velocity seems to increase in the central regions ( ngc2403 ) .",
    "the halo gas in ngc2403 also shows a radial infall towards the centre .",
    "* high velocity clouds : * several gas components with high ( vertical ? ) velocities have been found ( ngc2403 , ngc6946 ) .",
    "the difference between their velocities and the regular rotation velocity reaches values of 200@xmath2300 km s@xmath3 .",
    "the largest differences are observed in the inner regions ( ngc2403 ) . in some cases ( not always )",
    "they are associated with holes in the hi  distribution .",
    "the origin and nature of the halo gas remain uncertain .",
    "the rotation velocity gradient , the diffuse hot gas found in ngc2403 , and the concentration of the high velocity clouds in the central ( star forming ) part seem to indicate that it is produced by a galactic fountain process ( e.g.  bregman 1980 ) .",
    "other facts such as the presence of massive , filamentary complexes ( ngc2403 ; m33 , j.m .",
    "van der hulst , private communication ) and the presence of high velocity clouds beyond the optical disk ( ngc6946 , ngc2403 ) have no obvious explanations in a galactic fountain model and may point at an external origin .",
