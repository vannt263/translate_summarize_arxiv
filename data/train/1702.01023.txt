    "however , inclusion of dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction ( dmi ) , which is very evident in systems with reasonable soc , along with the original exchange interactions has been shown to give rise magnetic transition to long - range ordered state at low temperature in otherwise frustrated disordered systems.@xcite    among the pyrochlore iridates , y@xmath1ir@xmath1o@xmath4 is of particular interest",

    "<S> the interplay between spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) and electron correlation ( @xmath0 ) is considered for many exotic phenomena in iridium oxides . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the evolution of structural , magnetic and electronic properties in pyrochlore iridate y@xmath1ir@xmath2ru@xmath3o@xmath4 where the substitution of ru has been aimed to tune this interplay . </S>",
    "<S> the ru substitution does not introduce any structural phase transition , however , we do observe an evolution of lattice parameters with the doping level @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> x - ray photoemission spectroscopy ( xps ) study indicates ru adopts charge state of ru@xmath6 and replaces the ir@xmath6 accordingly . </S>",
    "<S> magnetization data reveal both the onset of magnetic irreversibility and the magnetic moment decreases with progressive substitution of ru . </S>",
    "<S> these materials show non - equilibrium low temperature magnetic state as revealed by magnetic relaxation data . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , we find magnetic relaxation rate increases with substitution of ru . </S>",
    "<S> the electrical resistivity shows an insulating behavior in whole temperature range , however , resistivity decreases with substitution of ru . </S>",
    "<S> nature of electronic conduction has been found to follow power - law behavior for all the materials . </S>"
