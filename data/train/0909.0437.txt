    "beyond the galaxies and the hot gas , clusters of galaxies host non - thermal components in the form of @xmath4 g magnetic fields and relativistic particles mixed with the thermal intracluster medium ( icm ) , which prove themselves through steep - spectrum diffuse radio emission in the form of radio halos and relics ( see ferrari et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for a recent review ) .",
    "these powerful sources ( radio power p@xmath5 10@xmath610@xmath7 w hz@xmath8 ) are extended on the mpc - scale and are characterized by very low surface brightness ( @xmath4jy arcsec@xmath9 at 1.4 ghz ) .",
    "the origin of these sources has long been considered a puzzle , due to their rare occurrence and to the unclear origin of the radiating relativistic particles ( brunetti ( 2008 ) and cassano ( 2009 ) for recent reviews ) .",
    "radio halos are always found in unrelaxed clusters ( buote 2001 ; venturi et al .",

    "2004 ; giacintucci et al .",
    "2005 , 2009 ) , which are clear signatures of very recent or ongoing merger events .",
    "this suggests a link between the gravitational process of cluster formation and the origin of radio halos .",
    "the presence of a correlation between the radio power of halos and the x - ray luminosity , mass , and temperature of the host cluster further supports a tight connection between the thermal and non - thermal components in the icm ( liang et al .",

    "( venturi et al . 2007 , 2008 ; hereinafter v07 , v08 ) , carried out with the gmrt at 610 mhz , firmly established that ( 1 ) radio halos are not ubiquitous in clusters , with only @xmath10 of the selected x - ray luminous clusters hosting a radio halo ( v08 ; cassano et al .",
    "2008 , hereinafter c08 ) , and ( 2 ) the distribution of radio halos in the p@xmath11  cluster x - ray luminosity ( l@xmath1 ) plane is _ bimodal _ : clusters with and without radio halos are clearly separated , with radio halos always found in dynamically disturbed systems ( brunetti et al .",
    "2007 ; v08 ) .    a model that explains the origin of radio halos is provided by the so - called _ turbulent re - acceleration _ scenario ( brunetti et al .",
    "2001 ; petrosian 2001 ) , where it is assumed that magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) turbulence , injected in the icm during cluster ",
    "cluster mergers , has an important role in the re - acceleration of relativistic electrons . according to this scenario ,",
    "radio halos are expected to be relatively _ rare _ and _ transient _ phenomena ( with a lifetime @xmath12 gyr ) generated in dynamically active clusters .",
    "the fraction of galaxy clusters with radio halos is expected to increase with cluster mass , since mergers in massive clusters are expected to generate enough turbulence to accelerate relativistic electrons at energies of several gev ( cassano & brunetti 2005 ) .    based on the above arguments , and motivated by the weak lensing analysis of the massive and unrelaxed cluster a1351 ( holhjem et al .",

    "the shortest baselines ensure the proper imaging of extended radio emission up to @xmath217@xmath31.5 in angular size , corresponding to @xmath21 2.1 mpc at the redshift of a1351 .",
    "the high angular resolution provided by the longest baselines allows us to identify and separate possible discrete radio sources projected onto the diffuse emission . with the final combined array we made a set of images , with resolutions ranging from @xmath32.5 ( full resolution , uniform weighting and 1@xmath33 @xmath4jy b@xmath8 ) to @xmath34 ( natural weighting , taper , and 1@xmath35 @xmath4jy b@xmath8 ) .",

    "source a is extended and is associated with sdss j114224.77 + 583205.3 , the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) .",
    "the diffuse emission has no obvious optical counterpart , and permeates the cluster region south of the bcg .",
    "figure [ fig : halo ] presents a low - resolution image of the radio emission at the cluster center , overlaid on the smoothed x - ray image obtained from archival _ rosat _ high resolution imager ( hri ) data .",
    "the radio image was produced after subtraction of the discrete radio galaxies ( a to g in figure [ fig : radio_opt ] ) , and using the uv range 0.216 k@xmath30 .",
    "the image confirms the presence of a diffuse radio source extending on the cluster scale , whose elongation and overall size are in good agreement with the brightest region detected in the x - ray .",
    "the radio morphology is irregular , with a peak of emission coincident with the x - ray peak",
    ". a southern feature , which we label _ ridge _ , is spatially coincident with an edge in the x - ray image . in the northern region",
    "a faint filament of radio emission extends toward the northeast , similar to the x - ray emission . given its location , morphology , and largest linear size of @xmath39 mpc",
    ", we classify the diffuse source in a1351 as a _ giant radio halo_. the _ ridge _ is the brightest and most peripheral region of the halo , and its location with respect to the x - ray brightness distribution raises the possibility that it might be a radio relic projected onto the radio halo emission .",
    "+ comparison between the morphology of the radio halo ( figure [ fig : halo ] ) and the mass reconstruction in h09 ( their figure 5 ) shows that the halo is associated with the most massive cluster substructure , and the northern radio filament ( figure [ fig : halo ] ) points toward a secondary peak both in the mass reconstruction and number density of galaxies .",
    "+ the total flux density of the radio halo in figure [ fig : halo ] is s@xmath11= 32.4 mjy , corresponding to a radio power p@xmath40= 1.17@xmath2810@xmath7 w hz@xmath8 . the _ ridge _ accounts for approximately 40% of the total flux density ( p@xmath11= 4.67@xmath2810@xmath6 w hz@xmath8 ) .",
    "we note that the contribution of residual emission from the head  tail ( source a in figure [ fig : radio_opt ] ) is @xmath36 4 mjy , as estimated from the comparison of the flux measurements on a set of different resolution images of the whole radio emission from the cluster ( including the diffuse emission and the contribution of the individual radio galaxies ) .",
    "the current picture of radio halo formation in galaxy clusters is very complex and tightly connected to the process of formation and evolution of the host cluster ( brunetti ( 2008 ) for a recent review ) .",
    "monte carlo simulations , carried out under the hypothesis that mhd turbulence in cluster mergers may re - accelerate high - energy particles , show that about 30% of x - ray luminous ( l@xmath41 erg s@xmath8 ) galaxy clusters at z@xmath21 0.2 - 0.3 are expected to host a giant radio halo ( c06 ; c08 ) . in this context , the presence of diffuse cluster - scale radio emission in a1351 is not surprising since the cluster is a massive and x - ray luminous system experiencing a major merger event ( allen et al .",
    "2003 ; h09 ) .",
    "in particular , cassano & brunetti ( 2005 ) derived an analytical formula for the turbulent - acceleration rate based on a single - merger scenario . assuming a redshift z=0.322",
    ", we find that steep - spectrum mpc - scale radio emission at 1.4 ghz ( that requires acceleration timescales @xmath42 gyr ) is expected to be generated in connection with a merger with mass ratio @xmath43 , for a total virial mass of the system @xmath44 ( consistent with the weak lensing analysis in h09 ) , or @xmath45 , for @xmath46 ( derived from the @xmath47@xmath48 correlation ; c06 ) .",
    "furthermore , based on the gmrt observations in v07 and v08 and literature data , c08 showed that the fraction of clusters with radio halo in the redshift range @xmath49 and with @xmath50 erg s@xmath8 is on the order of @xmath51 , in line with the expectations of the re - acceleration scenario .",
    "remarkably , the x - ray luminosity ( @xmath52 erg s@xmath8 ) and redshift ( z@xmath53 ) of a1351 are within these same ranges .    in figure [",
    "fig : corr ] we show the distribution of the clusters of the _ gmrt radio halo survey _ and of other radio - halo clusters from the literature in the @xmath54 plane ( adapted from brunetti et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the clusters hosting a radio halo are clearly separated from those without .",
    "the analysis of the dynamical properties ( where available ) suggests that such separation is most likely due to the different dynamical state of _ radio - loud _ and _ radio - quiet _ clusters : radio halos are always found in dynamically disturbed clusters , while _ radio - quiet _ clusters tend to be relaxed systems ( v08 ) .",
    "this can be interpreted in the framework of the re - acceleration scenario since clusters are expected to move with time from the _ radio - quiet _",
    "region ( upper limits in figure [ fig : corr ] ) to the p@xmath55 correlation in a relatively short timescale ( on the order of @xmath56 years , i.e. , the re - acceleration timescale of the emitting electrons ) , leaving the region between radio - halo and _ radio - quiet _",
    "clusters poorly populated ( brunetti et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : corr ] we report the position of a1351 as a magenta symbol .",
    "the diffuse radio emission in a1351 has a complex morphology , and the data currently available do not allow us to establish if the _ ridge _ ( figure [ fig : halo ] ) is part of the radio halo emission or a radio relic located in the southern region of the cluster .",
    "for this reason , the logp@xmath57 value adopted in figure [ fig : corr ] ( logp@xmath11 [ w hz@xmath8]@xmath59 ) is an intermediate value , whose associated large errors account for the possibility that the _ ridge _ is either part of the radio halo or unrelated to it .",
    "the location of a1351 is consistent with the distribution of all radio halos known so far .",
    "we underline that the plot in figure [ fig : corr ] includes all the information available in the literature so far : only @xmath21 20 clusters are known to host a giant radio halo , therefore the detection of a new one in a well - constrained merging system contributes to settle the radio - halo cluster merger connection .",
    "using archival vla data at 1.4 ghz we found a giant radio halo in the massive galaxy cluster a1351 , with a total extent of @xmath21 1.1 mpc and a radio power p@xmath11= 1.2@xmath2810@xmath7 w hz@xmath8 .",
    "the host cluster is experiencing a major merger process which is responsible for the complex distribution of the x - ray emitting gas and total mass of the system , as revealed by the x - ray and weak lensing studies .",
    "the ongoing merger may generate turbulence in the cluster volume , which in turn may re - accelerate relativistic electrons in the icm and generate mpc - scale radio emission .",
    "monte carlo simulations , carried out under this hypothesis , show that about 30@xmath60 of x - ray luminous ( l@xmath61 erg s@xmath8 ) galaxy clusters at z@xmath21 0.2 - 0.3 are expected to host a giant radio halo ( c06 , c08 ) . remarkably , the position of a1351 in the plane p@xmath11@xmath62 is consistent with that of all the other radio - halo clusters known to date , suggesting a causal link between the dynamical state of massive ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) clusters and the presence of giant radio halos .",
    "follow - up observations at lower ( and multi ) frequency will be important to derive the total radio spectrum of the diffuse emission , which is an essential information to discriminate between the theoretical models for the formation of radio halos ( e.g. , brunetti et al .",
    "2008 , dallacasa et al .",
    "2009 ) . a spatially resolved image of the spectral index distribution in the halo will also be a useful tool to shed light on the origin of the diffuse radio component in a1351 .",
