    "balayan ( 1997 ) identified 10 cataclysmic variables among the stars of the second buryakan sky survey ( makarian and stepanian 1983 ) .",
    "seven of these variables were already known , but three were new .",
    "one of these new objects was ks uma ( sbs 1017 + 533 ) .    in 1998",
    "the star was observed in the bright state .",
    "detection of the superhumps with period of 0.0697 day during this event by t. vanmunster proved that ks uma belongs to the group of su uma type dwarf novae .    historical light curve of the star based on the harvard college observatory photographic plates was obtained by hazen and garnavich ( 1999 ) .",
    "ks uma most probably coincides with the rosat x - ray source j1020.4 + 5304 ( snowden et al .",
    "1995 ) located only 10 arc sec away from the variable .",
    "on 2003 february 18/19 ks uma went into the superoutburst again as was announced by eddy muyllaert and gary poyner .",
    "because of the excellent visibility , and because of the lack of the entire coverage of a superoutburst in the past , we performed extensive ccd photometry of the star both in the superoutburst and quiescence .",
    "observations of ks uma reported in the present paper were obtained during 23 nights from 2003 february 21 to april 1 at the ostrowik station of the warsaw university observatory .",
    "they were collected using the 60-cm cassegrain telescope equipped with a tektronics tk512cb back illuminated ccd camera .",
    "the scale of the camera was 0.76\" / pixel providing a @xmath4 field of view .",
    "the full description of the telescope and camera was given by udalski and pych ( 1992 ) .",
    "we monitored the star in `` white light '' .",
    "this was due to the lack of an autoguiding system , not yet implemented after recent telescope renovation .",
    "thus we did not use any filter to shorten the exposures in order to minimize guiding errors .",
    "the exposure times were from 30 to 90 seconds during the bright state and from 150 to 300 seconds in the minimum light .",
    "a full journal of our ccd observations of ks uma is given in table 1 . in total , we monitored the star during 110.18 hours and obtained 3150 exposures .",
    ".journal of the ccd observations of ks uma [ cols=\"<,^,^ , > , > \" , ]     the @xmath5 departures for common and late superhumps are shown in fig .",
    "provided our cycle count is correct , we can conclude that in the second stage of the superoutburst and during late superhump phase the superhump period decreased with a rate of @xmath6 i.e. value quite typical for medium and long period su uma stars .",
    "as displayed in fig .",
    "5 ks uma in quiescence shows quasi - periodic modulations with amplitude reaching even 0.5 mag . the most characteristic feature observed in this stage was sinusoidal wave with period around 0.1 days clearly visible during late march nights .",

    "24/25  apr .",
    "01/02 is shown in fig . 13 . before calculation the light curves were prewhitened using second order polynomial .",
    "the periodogram yields no specific frequency of these modulations .",
    "the highest peak found in fig .",
    "13 corresponds to the frequency @xmath7 c / d i.e. to the period of @xmath8 days and exceeds only marginally compeating features .",
    "we reported extensive photometry of the dwarf nova ks uma in its 2003 superoutburst and quiescence .",
    "the amplitude of the superoutburst was 3.9 mag .",
    "the maximal brightness of the star was 12.3 mag and the mean magnitude in quiescence was 16.2 .        in the middle stage of superoutburst the period of superhumps was increasing with a rate of @xmath1 and later was decreasing with a rate of @xmath2 . comparing ks uma to other su uma stars we concluded that this group of dwarf novae shows decreasing superhump periods at the beginning and the end of superoutburst but increasing period in the middle phase .",
    "this is contrary to the original suggestion of warner ( 1985 , 1995 ) and patterson et al .",
    "( 1993 ) that superhump periods usually decrease with a rate around @xmath9 and also in contrast with a recent investigation of kato et al .",
    "( 2001a ) who concluded that short period systems shows increasing periods but long period su uma stars are characterized by decreasing periods .    at the end of the superoutburst and during first dozen days of quiescence the star showed late superhumps with a mean period of @xmath3 days .",
    "this phenomenon was observed even 30 days after beginning of the superoutburst .",
