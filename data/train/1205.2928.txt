    "[ intro ]    strongly correlated electron systems , such as the high temperature superconductors and other oxides , exhibit complex phase diagrams . in spite of intensive research during the past decade , there is no consensus on a possible mechanism for the superconductivity and certain new phases that are found from time to time .",
    "recent measurements of magnetoresistivity , resistivity , ir reflectivity and neutron scattering in ruthenates@xcite , iron - based superconductors  @xcite and cuprates  @xcite show an interesting phase which locally breaks the rotational point group symmetry ( @xmath1 ) along @xmath2 and @xmath3 axes ( these directions for cuprates , defined along the cu - o bond directions in the cu - o plane ) but preserves the translational symmetry .",
    "the symmetry of this phase greatly resembles the well - known nematic phase in isotropic liquid crystals , and hence the phase is called an electronic nematic state .    a two - dimensional ( 2d ) electronic nematic phase is usually referred to as a phase that spontaneously breaks the symmetry of the underlying hamiltonian associated with interchanging the @xmath2 and @xmath3 axes ( defined in a certain plane ) of the system  @xcite . unlike conventional liquid crystals , in which the nematic state is due to the special shape of the molecules or the anisotropic interaction between molecules , the origin of an electronic nematic phase is the local electronic correlation .",
    "when @xmath1 symmetry is reduced to @xmath4 symmetry , the system is expected to have a @xmath5-fold degenerate ground state .",
    "the two ground states will be randomly distributed on the 2d plane and will form locally different domains similar to magnetic domains in an ising model .",
    "the effects of differently oriented domains are very likely to cancel out globally ( i.e. , on a larger length scale ) and give rise to a lattice that appears uniform ( i.e. , without the above symmetry breaking ) .",
    "it is technically difficult to detect the local electronic nematic symmetry breaking with disordered domains .",
    "many experiments focus on @xmath6 because its orthorhombic structure plays a role similar to an external field that can align nematic domains along the same direction , so that it is easy to measure the macroscopic anisotropic effect",
    ". however the orthorhombicity also makes it hard to distinguish whether the anisotropic effect is caused by the distorted lattice structure or the local electronic correlation .",
    "recent publications  @xcite have reported a clear and strong anisotropic resistivity even when the orthorhombicity is well suppressed and the temperature dependence of the anisotropic effect is different from that of a lattice distortion .",
    "this implies that the in - plane transport anisotropy can not be explained solely by distorted lattice structures .",
    "this result was later supported by a cellular dynamical mean field theory ( cdmft)@xcite study of the two - dimensional hubbard model by okamoto _",
    "et al . _",
    "they showed that a strong nematic resistivity could be induced by a very small orthorhombic distortion as long as the interaction is strong enough to yield a mott transition .    another way to identify local nematicity",
    "is by using scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) with a rather high resolution .",
    "the sts can detect directly the electronic density of states within a nematic domain . in a recent publication",
    ", it is reported that the state - of - the - art sts measurements show  intra - unit - cell \" electronic nematicity  @xcite on a perfectly symmetric lattice along the @xmath2 and @xmath3 axes _",
    "i.e. , _ a lattice that is not orthorhombic .",
    "thus , this measurement provides the most direct evidence that the local nematic effect , in some strongly correlated materials , is purely electronic and originates from repulsive electron - electron interactions .",
    "the experimental results from sts detection depict a fascinating picture of disordered local nematic states fluctuating throughout the undistorted cooper oxide plane , but , to our knowledge , there is no simple theoretical model supporting this idea .",
    "the motivation for this report is the possible existence of a ground state of the one - band hubbard lattice hamiltonian with spontaneous @xmath7 symmetry breaking . in order to identify and address such a locally nematic ground state , a real - space quantum cluster method  @xcite which can treat both the local and global effects at the same time",
    "is probably the best option for the problem . in this report , the variational cluster approximation ( vca )  @xcite calculations are performed on a @xmath1-symmetric , two - dimensional hubbard square lattice .",
    "the results from the vca calculations are used to make further analysis of this phase .",

    "it is important to note that @xmath37 and @xmath38 are both fictitious parameters , which indicate the influence of long - range order on the small clusters , so the bigger the size of the cluster , the smaller the fictitious parameters are .",

    "our results directly demonstrate that the nematicity can arise within a one - band isotropic ( non - degenerate ) hubbard model .",
    "the nematic phase is suppressed as the electron density increases toward the half - filled state , but as the electron density gets close to optimal doping , while the coulomb interaction is large enough , the nematicity suddenly gets enhanced and is likely to give rise to a phase similar to the stripe structure .",
