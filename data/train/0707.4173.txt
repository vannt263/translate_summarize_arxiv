    "yet there are a wide variety of physical processes that may be responsible for these evolutionary trends  including galaxy mergers , galaxy - galaxy harassment , gas stripping by the icm , or tidal processes @xcite .",
    "observationally , it has so far been impossible to fully separate the effects of the various physical processes , in large part due to the overlapping regimes of influence for each of the proposed mechanisms ( see * ? ? ?",
    "further complicating the picture , the large scale assembly states of clusters show considerable variety @xcite , such that the dominant forces acting on galaxies are likely to vary from cluster to cluster , or over the course of an individual cluster s assembly history . but",
    "gaining an understanding of the complex interplay between a variable icm , the properties of assembling galaxies , and the overall cluster dynamical state is crucial if we are to have a complete picture of the growth and evolution of galaxies in a hierarchical universe .    in this paper",
    ", we combine optical ( _ hst _ ) and uv ( _ galex _ ) imaging of two @xmath4 galaxy clusters with ground - based spectroscopy of member galaxies , in an attempt to trace directly the buildup of passive early - type galaxies via a detailed ` case study ' of the galaxy population across each cluster .",
    "the two studied clusters , cl  0024 + 17 ( @xmath5 ) and ms  0451 ( @xmath3 ) , are part of a long - term campaign to trace the evolution of galaxies in wide fields ( @xmath6  mpc diameter ) centered on both clusters , using a variety of methods . by undertaking an in - depth , wide - field comparative study of two prominent clusters ,",

    "* ) and theoretical investigations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which trace with a broad brush the evolution in star formation rate and the buildup of structure in the universe .    the first paper in our series , @xcite ( hereafter paper i ) , introduced our panoramic _",
    "hst _ imaging of cl  0024 and began our ongoing discussion of the physical processes that may be acting on galaxies within clusters .",
    "in several subsequent papers , whose results are summarized in   2 , we have added extensive optical spectroscopy to the program , allowing targeted investigations of galaxy stellar populations and star formation rates as a function of cluster - centric radius , local density , and morphology .",
    "our goal for this paper is to bring our complete survey data set to bear on the question of how galaxies are affected by their environment , as a function of both the overall cluster properties and of local environment within each cluster . for maximum clarity and deductive power",

    "this approach is similar to using the color - magnitude relation to divide our sample into ` red sequence ' and ` blue cloud ' galaxies , but it provides additional leverage to identify galaxies in transition .",
    "early - type galaxies that have either been newly transformed or prodded back into an active phase , or spiral galaxies where star formation is being suppressed or enhanced will all stand out in our sample . at the same time ,",
    "their morphologies reveal important information about their formation histories prior to their current transition state , information that colors alone do not provide .",
    "our strategy also has the benefit of allowing us to directly investigate the hypothesis that many cluster spirals transform into s0s between @xmath4 and today @xcite  an investigation that will form the basis of this paper .    in the next section",

    "we confirm in  5 that this is the case , via identification of newly created s0s that we believe reflect the distinct passive spiral populations found in each cluster . in  6 , we consider the environments of these galaxies in transition , and begin to investigate the physical mechanisms that may be responsible for these transformations . in  7",
    ", we outline a model of how galaxy evolution proceeds in each cluster .",
    "we consider the fundamental plane as a way to further constrain the physical mechanisms at work , and derive similar constraints from the populations of compact emission line galaxies in both clusters .",

    "cl  0024 and ms  0451 were chosen for study primarily because of their comparable total masses , similar galaxy richness , and strong lensing features , while exhibiting x - ray properties that are quite distinct ( see table  [ tab : basic ] ) . while ms",
    "0451 is one of the most x - ray luminous clusters known @xcite , cl  0024 is somewhat under - luminous in the x - ray , with a mass inferred from _",
    "xmm / newton _ observations that significantly underestimates the mass derived from other methods @xcite .",
    "ms  0451 has x - ray luminosity seven times larger than cl  0024 , with a corresponding gas temperature nearly three times as high .",
    "this implies a large difference in the density and radial extent of the intracluster medium ( icm ) between the two clusters . as a result",
    ", icm - related physical processes are naively expected to be more important in the evolution of currently infalling ms  0451 galaxies than in cl  0024 .",
    "schematic diagram indicating the cluster - centric radius over which each of several listed physical mechanisms may be effective at fully halting star formation or transforming the visual morphology of a radially infalling galaxy .",
    "each physical mechanism listed can act effectively over the radial range indicated by the solid ( cl  0024 ) or dashed line ( ms  0451 ) .",
    "arrows indicate the virial radius for each cluster .",
    "note that tidal processes here refer to interactions with the cluster potential , while tidal forces during galaxy  galaxy interactions are a component of the harassment mechanism .",
    "each regime of influence was calculated according to the simple models described in paper i for cl  0024 , using the global cluster properties given in table  [ tab : basic ] . ]    in the schematic diagram shown in figure  [ mechanisms ] , we apply simple scaling relations to estimate the regimes of influence for several key physical processes which could be acting on infalling galaxies , following the procedure described in paper i. icm - related processes , such as gas starvation @xcite and ram - pressure stripping @xcite begin to affect galaxies at much larger radius in ms  0451 . as in paper",
    "i , we expect that other icm - related processes such as thermal evaporation @xcite or viscous stripping @xcite operate with at most similar strength to ram pressure , and so we do not consider them separately . an important caveat , however , is that the role of difficult - to - observe shocks in the icm are unknown , and are not accounted for in figure  [ mechanisms ] ( but see  7 ) .",
    "similarly , the two clusters differing masses set the radial regions where galaxy merging will be effective ; because of the @xmath19 higher mass of ms  0451 , typical galaxy relative velocities become too fast for mergers to occur at a higher radius than in cl  0024 .",
    "the differing regimes of influence for the physical mechanisms illustrated in figure  [ mechanisms ] provide the key template for our attempt to disentangle the relative importance of the various processes .",
    "by surveying the galaxies of both clusters for signs of recent transformation or disturbance , across the entire radial range to @xmath20  mpc , we hope to associate the sites and characteristics of galaxies in transition with the likely causes from figure  [ mechanisms ] .",
    "an additional factor not reflected in figure  [ mechanisms ] , however , is the overall assembly state and level of substructure in each cluster .",
    "therefore , figure  [ mechanisms ] can only be used as a guide , and we must carefully consider the effects that large - scale cluster assembly and irregularities may have on their galaxies as well .",
    "for example , the effects of tidal processes and galaxy - galaxy harassment , which according to figure  [ mechanisms ] should occur in much the same regions across both clusters , may very well differ greatly between clusters depending on how well each is virialized . as we will discuss below ,",
    "there are marked differences in the levels of substructure between the two clusters , and these may drive important differences between the galaxy populations .",
    "distribution of redshifts for both cl  0024 ( top ) and ms0451 ( bottom ) , including all galaxies with spectroscopically confirmed redshifts from our observations as well as previously published redshifts ( see  3 ) . in cl  0024",
    ", we identify 508 cluster members , defined to lie in the range @xmath21 . in ms  0451",
    ", we count 319 cluster members in the range @xmath22 . ]",
    "while it is evident from their different x - ray luminosities that ms  0451 and cl  0024 provide quite different environments for their constituent galaxies , our detailed study of environmental effects on cluster galaxies requires a comprehensive characterization of the two clusters and their respective environments .",
    "here , we study the radial velocities and spatial distributions of galaxies in each cluster , in order to evaluate the global kinematic structure of each cluster and identify significant substructures .    our extensive",
    "_ hst _ imaging and keck spectroscopy , which will be described more fully in  3 , readily reveal marked differences in the distributions of galaxies between the two clusters , suggesting that the clusters have quite dissimilar recent assembly histories . in figure",
    "[ redshifts ] , we display the distribution of redshifts for members of both cl  0024 and ms  0451 .",
    "the redshift distribution of ms  0451 members is broadly consistent with a gaussian distribution .",
    "a somewhat better fit to the data is given by a two - component double gaussian function , but the distribution splits into these two peaks only for galaxies at large radius ( @xmath23  mpc ) , suggesting that we are observing two filaments feeding galaxies into the virialized center of ms  0451 .",
    "cl  0024 galaxies likewise exhibit a double - peaked structure in redshift space , with two components that are widely separated and asymmetric in height .",
    "this feature was discovered by @xcite , and is thought to be the remnant of a high - speed , face - on encounter between the main cluster and a smaller subcluster or large group @xcite .",
    "the effects of this collision , even an estimated several gyr after it occurred @xcite , are still important in the core of cl  0024for example , as shown by intriguing recent claims of a ` dark matter ring ' in the core of cl  0024 @xcite .",
    "the measured line of sight velocity dispersion in the core of @xmath24  km  s@xmath16 implies a 3050@xmath25 lower mass than has been directly measured through strong and weak lensing constraints @xcite . the fact that the galaxy velocity distribution and x - ray emitting gas both underestimate the mass leads to the conclusion that the core of cl  0024 is not in virial nor hydrostatic equilibrium , an assumption that was made for each of these mass estimates .",
    "the lower relative velocities of galaxies in the cl  0024 core may importantly affect the action of physical processes whose strengths vary with galaxy velocity . for example , gas stripping by the icm may be even less effective in cl  0024 than naively predicted by figure  1 .",
    "the effects of galaxy  galaxy harassment may also be different , as close galaxy encounters may happen at both lower frequency and lower relative velocities than have previously been modeled in detail ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the spatial distribution of galaxies in ms  0451 and cl  0024 also show key differences . in figure",
    "[ dstests ] , we construct modified dressler - shectman ( d - s ) plots for the region within @xmath26 of each cluster @xcite . in such plots ,",
    "each cluster member is indicated by a circle , with the size of the circle proportional to that galaxy s ` dressler - shectman statistic ' : @xmath27\\ ] ] where line - of - sight velocity @xmath28 and dispersion @xmath29 are measured with respect to each galaxy s ten nearest neighbors , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the global cluster values .",
    "this statistic measures each galaxy s local deviation from a smooth , virialized velocity and spatial distribution .",
    "in other words , groups of large circles on the plot tend to indicate the presence of an infalling group . in figure",
    "[ dstests ] , we further color - code each galaxy according to its velocity with respect to the cluster center .",
    "the d - s plot for cl  0024 reveals the presence of at least two significant groups near to the cluster core : an infalling group at high velocity nearly along the line of sight to the cluster center , and a previously noted large group to the northwest of the cluster core , presumably assembling onto the core in an orientation almost in the plane of the sky . the large structure to the nw",
    "is also detected in both the weak lensing map ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter , paper ii ) and _ xmm / newton _ observations @xcite , which additionally suggest the presence of a shock front at the interface between the group and the main cluster .",
    "in contrast , the d - s plot for ms  0451 reveals an elongated but largely smooth distribution of galaxies .",
    "the cluster s elliptical shape is clearly visible , but the segregation of red points to the southeast and blue points to the northwest suggests a uniform contraction of the cluster along its major axis . while it is possible that the observed velocity field is due to cluster - scale rotation , previous analyses of the x - ray and sunyaev - zeldovich observations prefer a prolate or triaxial shape for ms  0451 @xcite , whereas the cluster would necessarily be oblate if the observed velocities are due to rotation .",
    "we may be seeing this spread in velocities reflected in the redshift distribution of ms  0451 , which splits into two peaks at large radius , likely indicating infall from two directions .",
    "one might worry that the elongated distribution gives ms  0451 an artificially large velocity dispersion , @xmath31 , but cluster mass estimates derived from @xmath31 are consistent with those derived from the x - ray and weak lensing analysis ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the origin of the elliptical shape is unclear , but may represent the remnant of a past major merger .",
    "nevertheless , still - bound infalling groups appear to be absent or insignificant within the virial radius .",
    "the overall increased level of substructure observed in cl  0024 is likely to have implications for the galaxy population . in comparison to ms  0451 , cl  0024 galaxies are more likely to have been a member of an infalling group in the recent past , and so we may expect to see more signs of recent group ` pre - processing ' in cl  0024 . furthermore , in the chaotic environment of cl  0024 the icm is more likely to be disturbed , and so shocks , cold fronts , or other features in the icm may be present , and could play an important role in the star formation histories of cluster members @xcite .      between the extremely dense icm in ms  0451 and the active assembly state of cl  0024 , these two clusters provide very distinct environments for their member galaxies . in the course of this paper , we will examine how the properties of transition galaxies in each cluster reflect these distinct environments . however , as our new results rely on and incorporate the findings of our previous papers in this series , we present here a brief summary of our investigations so far .",
    "we highlight in particular several results which , in the initial interpretation , hint at the action of one or more physical mechanisms from figure  [ mechanisms ] .",
    "@xmath32    by constructing the fundamental plane ( fp ) of cl  0024 , we observed in @xcite ( hereafter paper iii ) that elliptical and s0 galaxies ( e+s0s ) exhibit a high scatter in their fp residuals , equivalent to a spread of @xmath33 in mass to light ratio ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "the high scatter occurs only among galaxies in the cluster core , suggesting a turbulent assembly history for cluster early types , perhaps related to the recent cluster ",
    "subcluster merger @xcite .    around the virial radius of cl  0024",
    ", we observed a number of compact , intermediate ",
    "mass ellipticals undergoing a burst of star formation or weak agn activity , indicated by strong [ o@xmath35ii ]  emission ( paper iii ) .",
    "the [ o@xmath35ii ]  emitters reside in relatively low density and high speed regions , and so we deemed that they are not likely the remnants of mergers .",
    "though we will revisit the merger hypothesis in  7 , we tentatively concluded that the observed activity is caused by a rapidly acting physical process : two candidates are galaxy harassment and shocks in the icm , perhaps generated by the sub - cluster merger in cl  0024 .",
    "we searched for disruptions in the internal structures and star formation rates of disk galaxies due to tidal effects or galaxy  galaxy interactions , by measuring emission line rotation curves and constructing the tully - fisher relation @xcite .",
    "we find that the cluster tf relation exhibits significantly higher scatter than the field relation , echoing the high scatter seen in the cl  0024 fp .",
    "we argue that the high scatter in both @xmath36- and @xmath37-band tf relations demonstrate that cluster spirals are kinematically disturbed by their environment .",
    "we proposed that such disturbances may be due to galaxy merging and/or harassment .",
    "we combined _ galex _ uv observations with key spectral line indices to place strict constraints on the recent star formation histories of `` passive spiral '' galaxies , an important class of transition object @xcite .",
    "passive spirals show spiral morphology in _ hst _ images , but reveal weak or no [ o@xmath35ii ]   emission in their spectra , suggesting a lack of current star formation . through _ galex _ uv imaging , we find that passive spirals in cl  0024 exhibit uv emission nearly as strong as regular star - forming spirals , implying the presence of young stars .",
    "their unusual combination of uv emission with weak h@xmath38 strength supports a picture where passive spirals have experienced a rapid decline and eventual cessation of star formation over the last @xmath39  gyr .",
    "the timescale of this decline suggests `` starvation '' by the icm as a possible cause @xcite  a process where the intracluster medium ( icm ) strips gas from a galaxy s halo , causing star formation to decline due to the absence of new cold gas accretion onto the disk .    each of these previous investigations has revealed a partial view of environmental evolution across the studied clusters . through these investigations",
    ", we have identified several physical mechanisms that we could call ` likely suspects ' for driving galaxy evolution in clusters , and these seem to fall into two classes : galaxy  icm interactions and galaxy  galaxy interactions . however",
    ", a unified picture is still lacking .",
    "both of these flavors of interaction have been implicated before in the decline of star formation and the possible conversion of spirals into s0s ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , yet a detailed evaluation of their importance remains elusive .",
    "we aim in this paper to complete our accounting of galaxy evolution across these two quite distinct clusters , building on and linking our earlier work into what we hope will be a more comprehensive picture of how cluster galaxies are affected by their environment at intermediate redshift . to accomplish this , we will first document what we believe to be direct evidence for the transformation of spirals into s0s : through an analysis of their stellar populations and recent star formation rates ( sfrs ) , we link the passive spiral galaxies in both clusters to their eventual end states as newly - generated cluster s0 galaxies . only then , as we examine the physical mechanisms responsible for this transformation , will we draw on the above summarized results to place extra constraints on the physics driving the transformation",
    ". this discussion will include an extension of our analysis of the fundamental plane and the strongly - emitting compact e+s0s in cl  0024 to include ms  0451 , in order to further strengthen the constraints we can place on galaxy  galaxy interactions and galaxy  icm interactions , respectively .",
    "before turning to our new analysis , we must specify the characteristics of our now - complete data set . while most imaging and spectroscopic data on cl  0024 has been fully or partially described in previous papers (",
    "* paper i , paper iii ) , much of the following relies on new data for ms  0451 . in this section , we describe our new observations of ms  0451 , and provide updated information on cl  0024 , including _ galex _ imaging and additional spectroscopy .",

    "ms  0451 observations were taken with the acs , also in f814w , and provide contiguous coverage within a 10mpc@xmath4210mpc box centered on the cluster , with single orbit ( 2ks ) depth over the field .",

    "there are essentially two possible explanations for finding e+s0 galaxies with such low @xmath104 : either they have undergone recent star formation , or they harbor an agn that contributes to the spectrum . if they have formed stars recently or are continuing to form stars , then they must have either formed a significant population of stars at @xmath157 while already displaying early type morphology , or else transformed morphology from a star - forming spiral to an early type ( either singularly or through a merger ) . under each of these scenarios , there must be some way to account for the presence of emission lines in the cl  0024 objects but a lack thereof in ms  0451 .    a third possibility  that we have simply misclassified some spiral galaxies as s0s  is easy to discount based on this last requirement .",

    "could passive spirals be preferentially found in infalling groups ?",
    "some evidence for passive spirals in groups at these redshifts has already be noted @xcite . to evaluate quantitatively this possibility ,",

    "this argues strongly in favor of ram pressure stripping as the mechanism responsible for the uv - undetected passive spirals .",
    "we note that no spirals survive in environments where the ram pressure is more than a few times that required to strip the milky way , and a natural consequence of this limit is that no spirals in ms  0451 survive to reach @xmath196  kpc ( though , as expected , several young s0s appear at slightly lower radii ) . in  7.2 , we will discuss in more detail the relation between this presumed ram pressure stripping and other mechanisms that may be acting to transform morphology .",
    "so far , we have shown in  4 and  5 that the large population of passive spiral galaxies in both cl  0024 and ms  0451 are transforming into s0s on a variety of timescales . building on this , in  6 , we have successfully matched the timescales of transformation with specific environments within each cluster .",
    "consequently , we are now able to construct a road map describing the sites and timescales of transformations across both clusters .    to summarize , we find that some passive spirals are generated within infalling groups , experiencing a gradual decline in star formation rate and eventual transformation to s0 morphology . in the central regions of both clusters , a high proportion of spirals are seen to be passive . in cl  0024 , star formation within these spirals",
    "continues to decay at a relaxed pace , with few signs of rapid interaction with the cluster environment except near the very center where the effects of ram pressure begin to be important . in contrast",
    ", passive spirals all across the core of ms  0451 have had their star formation truncated rapidly , with a subsequent rapid transformation into s0 morphology .    in this section",
    ", we use this road map to consider the constraints that we can place on the physical processes operating in each of these three regimes : groups in the cluster outskirts , the cl  0024 core , and the ms  0451 core .      in the hierarchical assembly of clusters ,",
    "groups infalling from the cluster outskirts can be thought of as the building blocks .",
    "paper i argued that the existence of the morphology  density relation implies that a galaxy s evolutionary history is tightly linked to its group s history , until the group is absorbed into the cluster .",
    "furthermore , the observation that mass and light trace each other tightly on large to small scales ( paper ii ) suggests that groups of roughly constant mass to light ratio  rather than individual galaxies  coalesce to build up the cluster .",
    "the ` preprocessing ' of galaxies within these infalling groups is a crucial feature of evolution within both clusters , as here we are probing galaxies in a key density range at a key point in time : at @xmath197 , observations indicate that the early type fraction is growing only in the cores of clusters , while below @xmath4 evolution begins to accelerate in lower density regions @xcite . as such , gaining an understanding of the physical processes driving galaxy transformation within the infall regions of clusters at @xmath4 can shed light on the observed evolution in the morphology  density relation .    by virtue of the fact that passive spirals in the cluster outskirts are preferentially found in groups , we do not expect that the clusters icm plays a direct role in suppressing star formation . even in ms  0451",
    ", the force of the icm should not be significant beyond the virial radius ( figure  [ mechanisms ] ) . and",
    "while we had previously argued in favor of starvation by the icm @xcite , which can be effective at large cluster radius , there is little reason to expect it to act on galaxies in groups more effectively than isolated spirals .",
    "however , we can not rule out the presence of gaseous interactions _ within _ groups . indeed",
    ", x - ray observations of groups in the local universe reveal that they often harbor an intra - group medium @xcite , and simulations by @xcite suggest that the starvation mechanism can operate similarly within large groups as it would in the overall cluster ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "intriguingly , x - ray bright groups seem to contain a higher early - type fraction than x - ray undetected groups @xcite , consistent with the notion that the gas plays a role in shaping galaxy morphology .",
    "the predicted timescale for cessation of star formation under starvation is consistent with our observed decline over @xmath198  gyr @xcite ; in simulations by @xcite , a timescale of 12  gyr for the halt in star formation after gas removal provided a good fit to observations .",
    "we emphasize , however , that the @xmath149  gyr decline in star formation represents only one observable phase of the predicted total timescale for conversion of a spiral to an s0 via starvation ( @xmath199  gyr , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the slow action of starvation would preserve recognizable spiral structure for over 1  gyr after star formation stops , and we have shown in @xcite that these lifetimes for each phase are consistent with the hypothesis that all such passive spirals will become s0s by @xmath130 .    yet direct observations of the intra - group gas are challenging at these redshifts , especially for small groups ( but see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and other mechanisms may also be able to reproduce the observed timescale for the cessations of star formation .",
    "in addition , some models suggest that modification of star formation rates due to starvation only begin to be visible many gyr after the halo is stripped @xcite , and so the effectiveness of starvation in groups would depend in some sense on the dynamical age of each group , which is difficult to quantify .",
    "gentle gas stripping or starvation by a diffuse intra - group medium therefore remains an attractive , but difficult to test , possibility .",
    "alternatively , the increased frequency of galaxy  galaxy interactions among members of a group , compared to the interaction rate between isolated galaxies , could be driving the creation of passive spirals in the cluster outskirts .",
    "we note that , at the group scale , the effects of impulsive galaxy  galaxy interactions are difficult to separate from galaxy  galaxy tidal interactions that act over a longer timescale , and so we consider them together here .",
    "while galaxy  galaxy harassment at the typical velocity dispersions of bound groups has not been widely studied , there are some advantages to this explanation .",
    "first , on a larger cluster scale , simulations indicate that harassment of massive cluster spirals results in gas being funneled to the central bulge @xcite , providing a natural mechanism to accelerate star formation and deplete a spiral s gas supply ; a similar gas funneling effect due to tidal effects during group preprocessing has also been proposed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "while simulations would be necessary to test the hypothesis , one could imagine a ` gentle harassment ' mechanism that induces a transport of gas to the galaxy center without immediately destroying the spiral arms .",
    "a slow group - scale harassment could possibly reproduce the timescales for quenching of star formation indicated by the ` starvation ' model tracks in figure  [ hd_uvnew ] .",
    "we note that the timescale for final conversion to s0 morphology may be different from the timescale under starvation , and could provide an important discriminator between the two possibilities in the future .",
    "depending on the rate of gas transport , it is possible that a brief increase in star formation rate could be detected before the final quenching @xcite , and this could provide another way to distinguish between this mechanism and starvation .",
    "however , within the uncertainties , we can not confirm any small starbursts among galaxies within infalling groups in our sample .",
    "dividing our total sample of star - forming galaxies by radius into three equally - sized bins , we do not see evidence for an enhancement of either the mean or median [ o@xmath35ii ]  of a star forming galaxy in any of the three radial zones . nor do we see any change in the fraction of star - forming galaxies with strong ( @xmath200 ) [ o@xmath35ii ] .",
    "however , as the expected lifetime for a burst is short @xcite , we can not rule out the presence of small bursts that change the median specific star formation rate by less than 20% .",
    "a definitive distinction between gas - related processes and galaxy interactions therefore remains elusive .",
    "importantly , however , we have already established that galaxy  galaxy harassment is affecting spirals across both clusters , and at a level that does not destroy their spiral structure : @xcite found that the high scatter in the cluster tully - fisher relation compared to the field was most readily understood if galaxy harassment is acting to perturb the kinematics of spirals .",
    "@xcite also observed a strange deficit in the cluster outskirts of spirals with high central mass concentrations ; one possible explanation is that these galaxies have dropped out of our emission line sample as they become passive due to the aforementioned funneling of gas to their centers .",
    "while hardly a settled issue , we expect that the action of harassment is more likely to be at the root of the galaxy evolution in infalling groups , as the mechanism is already known to be acting in cl  0024 and ms  0451 .",
    "yet some contribution from the intra - group gas is also possible , and the two effects could act in combination .",
    "future study of the bulges of spirals and s0s could help distinguish between the mechanisms by establishing whether significant mass has been funneled to centers of galaxies during their evolution , as predicted in the case of harassment .",
    "we turn now to the cores of both clusters , where spirals in ms  0451 appear to have their star formation quenched at a more rapid pace than in cl  0024 .",
    "the most obvious explanation for the accelerated truncation of star formation within the central region of ms  0451 is , of course , its much denser icm . as we saw in figure  [ rampressure ] , rapid truncation of star formation appears to occur in both clusters only in regimes where the ram pressure is high .",
    "due to the dense icm in ms  0451 , such an environment is much more widespread in this cluster , and so , unlike in cl  0024 , most of the passive spirals in its core are experiencing a rapid truncation of star formation .",
    "ram pressure stripping , in regimes where it is effective , can strip an entire spiral disk in less than 100  myr @xcite .",
    "detailed analysis of local analogs of passive spirals thought to be undergoing ram - pressure stripping suggest a timescale of @xmath201  myr for the process to produce a galaxy similar to the uv - undetected passive spirals we observe @xcite . both of these are consistent with the maximum timescale of 400  myr implied by the 600  kpc hole devoid of spirals at the center of ms  0451 .",
    "further , there is some evidence that post - starburst / post - starforming galaxies in the coma cluster  similar to , but fainter than those in ms  0451are generated via ram pressure stripping @xcite .",
    "the fact that we observe passive spirals at all implies that the transformation to s0 is not precisely simultaneous with the halt in star formation @xcite . however , the ` truncated ' star formation history models presented in figure  [ hd_uvnew ] suggest that @xmath104 strength will increase at a fast rate after truncation , such that we must be seeing young s0s within 100  myr of the halt in star formation . the similar fraction of galaxies observed in both the passive spiral phase and the young s0 phase support the idea that the lifetimes for each phase are comparable , at about 100  myr .",
    "yet there are several remaining uncertainties in this simple picture .",
    "ram pressure stripping alone does not alter disk kinematics and spiral structure on such a short timescale , so there must be an additional mechanism to speed the conversion . in the cluster cores , harassment and/or tidal interactions could provide this additional impetus ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . in cl  0024 , in the absence of rapid truncation by the icm , a similar harassment or tidal process must be at work .",
    "however , the complex substructure of cl  0024 , and particularly the effects of the recent cluster collision , may generate importance differences between the two clusters .    in order to better constrain the mechanisms affecting passive spirals in the cores of cl  0024 and ms  0451 ,",
    "we are aided by two supplementary observations , one of which illuminates the action of harassment , with the other providing further constraints on icm interactions  particularly the hypothesis that shocks in the icm could be important .",
    "as discussed in  2 , we found in cl  0024 a population of relatively faint elliptical galaxies with strong emission , concentrated in a narrow range in radius close to the virial radius .",
    "we cast doubt on the idea that major mergers were the cause of these apparent starbursts , and we speculated that another rapidly acting physical interaction must be triggering these bursts of activity .",
    "strong shocks in the icm of cl  0024 could easily have been generated @xcite during the cluster - subcluster merger @xcite , and these shocks could be responsible for the triggered starbursts / agn we observe .",
    "if this were the case , we hypothesized that we would not see such bursts in ms  0451 , as its smoother large scale structure makes it less likely that such shocks would be generated .",
    "referring back to figure  [ spatial_dist ] , however , we see that objects of this type are indeed found in the outskirts of both clusters . while only half as many are identified in ms  0451 as in cl  0024 , this detection rate is consistent with the lower spectroscopic completeness of our ms  0451 campaign for galaxies at these low luminosities : in ms  0451 , 10% of detected cluster members are at @xmath202 , while in cl  0024 , the fraction is 20% .    the properties of these objects  compact size ,",

    "secondly , the minimum cluster radii at which these cnelgs / lbcgs are found identifies empirically the point at which merging becomes impossible and harassment must begin to dominate any galaxy - galaxy interaction .    in cl  0024",
    ", this occurs nearly at the virial radius , while in ms  0451 it occurs at a similar projected radius of 1.5  mpc .",
    "we expect , then , that harassment within 1.5  mpc should scale in strength similarly between the two clusters . if harassment is responsible for the slow conversion of spirals to s0 in the cl  0024 core , it should also be acting on ms  0451 spirals with similar strength .",
    "an analysis of the fundamental plane can provide sensitive constraints on the star formation and kinematic histories of e+s0s ( paper iii ) . in cl  0024 , we observed that elliptical and s0 galaxies form a clear fp ( figure  [ fp ] ) , yet they exhibit a high scatter , equivalent to a spread of @xmath33 in mass to light ratio ( @xmath34 ) .",
    ", where @xmath59 is the slope of the fp and @xmath206 is each galaxy s deviation from the cluster s overall fp intercept @xmath207 . ] upon closer inspection , this high scatter appeared to occur only among galaxies within 1  mpc of the cluster core .",
    "we suggested in paper iii that the enhanced scatter in the cluster core may somehow be related to the recent cluster - subcluster merger in cl  0024 @xcite . by examining the fp and its residuals for ms  0451 as well",
    ", we can test the hypothesis that galaxy interactions in the core of cl  0024 are enhanced over that expected for a relaxed cluster .    in constructing the fp for both clusters , surface brightness ( @xmath208 ) and effective radius ( @xmath209 )",
    "are determined via the galfit software @xcite , which fits a 2d model to the _ hst _ imaging .",
    "we fit models following the devaucoleur s function to each galaxy ( see paper iii ) , and apply a k  correction from observed f814w magnitudes to rest - frame @xmath37-band surface brightness , @xmath208 , as discussed in  3 .",
    "the resulting fp for our sample of 60 e+s0 galaxies in ms  0451 is shown in figure  [ fp ] , alongside the previously published fp for cl  0024 .",
    "for both cl  0024 and ms  0451 , we overplot the local fp from the coma cluster @xcite as a solid line , adapted to our chosen cosmology .",
    "in addition , we plot two parallel dashed lines indicating the galaxies expected fp intercept if they had formed in a single burst at @xmath210 or @xmath211 , calculated using the @xcite models .",
    "it is clear that the e+s0 populations in both clusters have largely formed their stars at @xmath212 .",
    "nevertheless , the high scatter in the cl  0024 fp also seems to be present in ms  0451 . limiting our sample to those galaxies with @xmath213  km  s@xmath16 as in paper iii",
    ", the overall scatter is @xmath214 , expressed in terms of a spread in @xmath215 , compared to @xmath216 for cl  0024 .",
    "a small portion of this large scatter in @xmath34 can be attributed to the higher redshift of ms  0451 , where an equivalent spread in galaxy formation ages translates into a larger fp scatter at @xmath3 than at @xmath217 . in figure  [ fp ] , this effect is most easily seen by noting the larger separation between the @xmath210 and @xmath211 model lines in the ms  0451 panel , compared to the cl  0024 panel . if ms  0451 early - types were to passively evolve between @xmath3 and @xmath217 , the single stellar population ( ssp ) models of @xcite predict a decrease in the fp scatter of only up to @xmath218 .",
    "this still leaves an unexpectedly high spread in mass to light ratios for ms  0451 early - types . in figure",
    "[ deltaml ] , we plot each galaxy s residual from the fp as a function of its dynamical mass , calculated according to @xmath219 ( see paper iii ) . in both clusters ,",
    "we observe a clear ` downsizing ' trend that has been described by several authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the tendency for less massive e+s0s to exhibit lower mass to light ratios , implying younger stellar populations .    to judge the effects of ` downsizing ' ,",
    "we fit a straight line to the fp residuals as a function of mass , limiting the fit to masses above @xmath220m@xmath221 , where selection effects are minimal . in ms  0451 , subtracting off this extra ` tilt ' to the fp greatly tightens the observed scatter , to @xmath222 , a level of scatter consistent with that of other well - virialized clusters at lower redshift ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "close inspection of the morphologies of galaxies in figure  [ deltaml ] uncovers the reason .",
    "while ellipticals in cl  0024 display a tight sequence in mass , s0s , especially at intermediate masses of @xmath228m@xmath221 , exhibit a remarkable scatter in their fp residuals .",
    "these residuals do not appear to correlate with any typical measures of star formation rate or mass to light ratio , including @xmath104 , h@xmath103 , or even broadband optical colors .",
    "it seems , then , that the previously described fp scatter in the core of cl  0024 can be ascribed almost entirely to s0s whose properties do not obey any simple trends with mass or star formation .",
    "furthermore , a significant number of cl  0024 galaxies exhibit fp residuals @xmath227 , an unphysical quantity that either indicates stellar populations older than those of coma cluster early types ( impossible due to the much younger age of the universe at @xmath217 and the extreme mass to light ratios implied ) , or else indicates the breakdown of the fundamental plane for these objects .",
    "in contrast , all of the scatter in ms  0451 early types is in the expected direction , in the sense that some galaxies have younger stellar populations with @xmath229 , while the most massive ellipticals and s0s lie neatly on the local fp .    what could be generating these abnormal galaxies in cl  0024 but not in ms  0451 ?",
    "enhanced levels of galaxy - galaxy interaction due to the complex substructure in cl  0024 is the most likely explanation .",
    "the difference between a slow conversion of spirals to s0s ( in cl  0024 ) and a rapid truncation of star formation ( in ms  0451 ) could also affect the positions of s0s on the fp .",
    "future simulations to test this possibility would be welcome .",
    "we note that the actual ` young s0s ' are only sparsely represented in figure  [ deltaml ] , due to the smaller sample of galaxies that can be plotted on the fp , and are not driving the observed difference by themselves .",
    "what , then , are the implications for the physical processes driving galaxy evolution in the cores of both clusters ? in short , we can conclude that the complex recent assembly history of cl  0024 _ does not _ enhance the ability of the icm to transform galaxies via shocks , but it _ does _ appear to enhance the observed kinematic disturbance of galaxies within the cluster core .",
    "some mix of galaxy  galaxy interaction and tidal interaction therefore must dominate in the core of cl  0024 , driving the steady decline in star formation rate within its spiral population . only for",
    "galaxies that reach the inner @xmath201kpc will ram pressure stripping become important .",
    "in contrast , the quenching of star formation in ms  0451 is almost certainly driven by ram pressure from the icm , probably coupled with galaxy and tidal interactions that serve to erase spiral structure and complete the morphological conversion . in ms  0451",
    ", the effects of harassment / tidal interaction must complete the morphological conversion more rapidly than in cl  0024 , where the stellar populations of passive spirals indicate that they are long - lived ( @xmath230  gyr ) . at the same time",
    ", the effects of this conversion must somehow decay rapidly enough in ms  0451 s0s to be unobserved in the residuals from the fp .",
    "future investigations into the effects of harassment on the s0 fundamental plane could help shed light on this issue .",
    "in this paper , we have presented new results from our comprehensive comparative survey of two massive , intermediate redshift galaxy clusters , cl  @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) and ms  @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we have identified and studied several key classes of transition objects in the clusters : the passive spirals and the young s0s . through uv imaging and measurements of spectral line indices ,",
    "we have concluded that some passive spirals have experienced a decline in star formation over a @xmath149  gyr timescale , mostly in cl  0024 , while others , mostly in ms  0451 , have experienced a more rapid truncation in star formation .",
    "for the first time , we have been able to conclusively identify spiral galaxies in the process of transforming into s0 galaxies , by directly linking the passive spirals in each cluster with their descendant s0s .",
    "having established that the transformation from spiral to s0 galaxies is taking place in each cluster , we have leveraged the differences between clusters in the timescales and spatial location of the conversion process , in order to evaluate the relative importance of several proposed physical mechanisms that could be responsible for the transformation .",
    "combined with other diagnostics that are sensitive to either icm - driven galaxy evolution or galaxy - galaxy interactions  including the residuals from the fundamental plane and the properties of ` signpost ' compact emission line galaxies  we paint a tentative but remarkably self - consistent picture of galaxy evolution in clusters .",
    "we find that spiral galaxies within infalling groups have already begun a slow process of conversion into s0s primarily via gentle galaxy - galaxy interactions that act to quench star formation , perhaps aided by interaction with the intra - group gas .",
    "the fates of spirals upon reaching the core of the cluster depend heavily on the cluster icm , with rapid conversion of all remaining spirals into s0s via ram - pressure stripping in clusters where the pressure of the icm is @xmath231 of that needed to strip a canonical milky way - like spiral . in the presence of a less - dense icm",
    ", the conversion continues at a slower pace , with galaxy - galaxy interactions continuing to play a role , perhaps along with ` starvation ' or gentle stripping by the icm .",
    "several authors have raised objections to a scenario where s0s are created via simple fading of spiral disks .",
    "first , s0s are observed to have higher bulge to disk ratios than their supposed spiral progenitors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that if the spiral to s0 conversion takes place , significant redistribution of mass or significant new star formation is required @xcite .",
    "second , other authors have noted that the local abundance of s0s is only weakly correlated with environment , such that processes like ram pressure stripping that act only in cluster cores can not be responsible for the entire buildup of s0s @xcite .    we have here demonstrated ,",
    "however , that simple stripping of gas does _ not _ build up the entire population of cluster s0s . rather , a combination of gas effects and galaxy interactions are responsible , in ratios that vary widely and depend on both the cluster dynamical state and the location within the cluster or its outskirts .",
    "the buildup of bulges through new star formation @xcite that is expected from harassment - like encounters could potentially balance out the expected fading of disks after ram pressure stripping has run its course .",
    "it may still be necessary to invoke significant obscured star formation to bridge the observed gap between the bulges of spirals and s0s @xcite ; the higher detection rate of such systems in cl  0024 compared to ms  0451 @xcite may indicate that such obscured starbursts are part of the pre - processing that occurs before galaxies encounter a dense icm .",
    "furthermore , the wide distribution of passive spirals across both clusters , and their association with groups in the cluster outskirts , indicates that the resulting s0s will likely be spread across a wide range of environments .",
    "the typical densities of infalling groups at @xmath4 are likely realized even in isolated groups by @xmath130 @xcite , and so it seems that , though a variety of mechanisms are responsible , passive spirals could be the progenitors of most local s0s .",
    "in @xcite , a rough assessment of the frequency of passive spirals and their expected lifetimes in cl  0024 suggested that passive spirals could account for the entire buildup of s0s between @xmath217 and @xmath130 . in ms  0451",
    ", we observe a similar number of spirals currently in the passive phase , but we have shown that the timescale for conversion is much shorter than in cl  0024 .",
    "this suggests that all existing spirals should be converted to s0 in ms  0451 even _ before _",
    "@xmath130 , and the rate of any future buildup should be limited by the infall rate of new galaxies . as ms  0451",
    "is a remarkably well - evolved system at @xmath3 , comparable in mass to virgo or coma ( @xmath232 and @xmath233 , respectively , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this is perhaps not surprising .",
    "it suggests , however , that there may exist a generic tipping point in the evolution of a massive cluster : beyond the threshold in ram pressure strength that we have identified here ( which is reached through some combination of cluster mass and icm density ) , spirals are transformed so rapidly upon infall that they will be essentially absent . by @xmath130 , many clusters have likely reached this threshold , as evidenced by their low spiral fractions @xcite .",
    "this sort of dichotomy between well - evolved and still - assembling clusters could , for example , explain why some clusters , like coma , reveal few signs of evolution in their massive galaxies @xcite , while others , like virgo , have a rich population of passive spirals and galaxies with other signs of recent evolution ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "regardless , the results presented here indicate that the abundant cluster spirals found at intermediate redshift , _ do _ , in fact , transform into the equally abundant s0 population seen today . the transformation process at @xmath234",
    ", as we have seen , is beginning to operate even in groups at the cluster outskirts . as a result ,",
    "the conversion of passive spirals to s0s can account for the evolution of the morphology  density relation at both the cluster and group scale from intermediate redshift to today .",

    "<S> hst _ optical and _ galex _ uv imaging with keck spectroscopy of member galaxies , we identify and study several key classes of ` transition objects ' whose stellar populations or dynamical states indicate a recent or ongoing change in morphology and star formation rate . for the first time , we have been able to conclusively identify spiral galaxies in the process of transforming into s0 galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this has been accomplished by locating both spirals whose star formation is being quenched as well as their eventual successors , the recently created s0s . </S>",
    "<S> differences between the two clusters in both the timescales and spatial location of this conversion process allow us to evaluate the relative importance of several proposed physical mechanisms that could be responsible for the transformation . combined with other diagnostics that are sensitive to either icm - driven galaxy evolution or galaxy - galaxy interactions  including the residuals from the fundamental plane and the properties of ` signpost ' compact emission line galaxies  we describe a self - consistent picture of galaxy evolution in clusters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that spiral galaxies within infalling groups have already begun a slow process of conversion into s0s primarily via gentle galaxy - galaxy interactions that act to quench star formation . </S>",
    "<S> the fates of spirals upon reaching the core of the cluster depend heavily on the cluster icm , with rapid conversion of all remaining spirals into s0s via ram - pressure stripping in clusters where the icm is dense . in the presence of a less - dense icm </S>",
    "<S> , the conversion continues at a slower pace , with galaxy - galaxy interactions continuing to play a role along with ` starvation ' by the icm . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the buildup of the local s0 population through the transformation of spiral galaxies is a heterogeneous process that nevertheless proceeds robustly across a variety of different environments from cluster outskirts to cores . </S>"
