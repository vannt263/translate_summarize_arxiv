    "it is generally believed that there are two qcd phase transitions in hot and dense nuclear matter@xcite .",
    "one of them is related to the deconfinement process in moving from a hadron gas to a quark - gluon plasma , and the other one describes the transition from the chiral symmetry breaking phase to the phase in which it is restored . since the deconfinement and restored phases are only intermediate states in relativistic heavy ion collisions which are considered to be the way to generate the two transitions in laboratories , the key problem is how to extract possible signatures of the phase transitions hidden in the final state distributions .",
    "one way to study the signatures of the chiral transition is to compare the properties of hadronic systems with and without undergoing a chirally symmetric phase . in recent years",
    "many such signatures have been proposed , such as the excess of pions due to a rapid thermal and chemical equilibration in the symmetric phase@xcite , the excess of low energy photon pairs by pion annihilation in hot and dense medium@xcite , the dilepton enhancement from leptonic decay of sigma@xcite , and the enhancement of the continuum threshold in the scalar channel@xcite .",
    "most of the signatures are associated with the changes of sigma properties at finite temperatures and densities . in the vacuum",
    "there is no obvious reason for the presence of the scalar meson sigma in the study of chiral properties .",
    "however , there is a definite need@xcite for sigma at finite temperatures and densities in the investigation of chiral symmetry restoration . with increasing @xmath2 and @xmath3 sigma changes its character from a resonance with large mass to a bound state with small mass .",
    "this medium dependence of sigma mass makes important sense not only in the above mentioned particle yields , but also in thermodynamics@xcite . the contribution from sigma to any thermodynamic function",
    "can for most case be neglected , because it is heavy , while it plays an important role in the region around the critical point of the chiral phase transition , since there @xmath5 .    from the recent qcd model calculations@xcite ,",
    "the chiral phase transition in the chiral limit with massless pions is of second order at high temperatures , and of first order at high densities .",
    "therefore , there is a tricritical point @xmath6 in the @xmath7 plane which separates the first- and second - order phase transition . in the real world with nonzero pion mass , the second order phase transition becomes a smooth crossover and the tricritical point @xmath6 becomes an endpoint @xmath8 of a first - order phase transition line . in relativistic heavy ion collisions , for the choice of control parameters like colliding energy and impact parameter such that the freeze - out of the system occurs near the point @xmath8 ,",
    "sigma is one of the most numerous species at the freeze - out , since it is nearly massless .",
    "these light sigmas at the freeze - out will lead to large event - by - event fluctuations@xcite of final state pions due to the @xmath9-exchange in the pion thermodynamic potential .",
    "another direct signature of this critical endpoint @xmath8 is a nonthermal excess@xcite of pions from the hadronic decay of sigma . with the expansion of the hadronic system produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions , the in - medium sigma mass rises towards its vacuum value and eventually exceeds the @xmath10 threshold .",
    "as the @xmath11 coupling is large , the decay proceeds rapidly .",
    "since this process occurs after freeze - out , the pions generated by it do not have a chance to thermalize .",
    "thus , it is expected@xcite that the resulting pion spectrum will have a nonthermal enhancement at low transverse momentum .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a systematic and detailed investigation of the above idea@xcite on excess pions produced by sigma decay in a chiral quark model in the whole @xmath7 plane , without the assumption that the freeze - out occurs at the chiral transition . in the chiral limit , we know very well that the sigma decay into two pions starts at the phase transition point , and the freeze - out happens later .",
    "therefore , the sigma decay before and after the freeze - out will result in thermal and nonthermal enhancements of pions , respectively .",
    "our motivation here is to see that in which temperature and density region of freeze - out there is a strong nonthermal enhancement .",
    "we proceed as follows . in section 2",
    "we calculate the sigma decay rate as a function of @xmath2 and @xmath3 to the lowest order in a @xmath1 expansion in the framework of the nambu - jona - lasinio model ( njl ) at quark level@xcite , and discuss the importance of the bose - einstein statistics at high @xmath2 and the dominance of the first - order transition at high @xmath3 .",
    "the in - medium pion mass drops down with decreasing @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "when it approaches to its vacuum value , the freeze - out happens . with this definition of freeze - out and the help of scaling hydrodynamics to describe the expansion of the hadronic system",
    ", we study in section 3 the thermal and nonthermal pion enhancements due to @xmath9 decay .",
    "finally we give our summary and point out open problems that remain .",
    "one of the models that enables us to see directly how the dynamical mechanisms of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration operate is the njl model applied to quarks@xcite . within this model",
    "one can obtain the hadronic mass spectrum and the static properties of mesons remarkably well .",
    "in particular , one can recover the goldstone mode , and some important low - energy properties of current algebra such as the goldberger - treiman and gellmann - oakes - renner relations . because of the contact interactions between quarks that is introduced in this model , there is of course no confinement",
    ". a further consequence of this feature is that the model is non - renormalizable , and it is necessary to introduce a regulator @xmath12 that serves as a length scale in the problem .",
    "the sigma decay rate at zero density in this model was firstly studied by hatsuda and kunihiro@xcite . in order to investigate the thermal and nonthermal pion yields by sigma decay ,",
    "we recalculate here the decay rate in the whole @xmath7 plane , and analyze its relation with the first - order transition in high density region .",
    "the two - flavor version of the njl model is defined through the lagrangian density , @xmath13,\\ ] ] where only the scalar and pseudoscalar interactions corresponding to @xmath9 and @xmath14 mesons , respectively , are considered , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the quark fields , the operate @xmath17 is the @xmath18 isospin generator , @xmath19 is the coupling constant with dimension @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the current quark mass .    in an expansion in the inverse number of colors , @xmath1 ,",
    "the zeroth order ( hartree ) approximation for quarks together with the first - order ( rpa ) approximation for mesons gives a self - consistent treatment of the quark - meson plasma in the njl model . in the chiral limit the tricritical point @xmath6 is located at @xmath22 in the @xmath7 plane . in the case of explicit chiral symmetry breaking the endpoint of the first - order transition line",
    "is shifted with respect to the tricritical point @xmath6 towards large @xmath3 , its position is @xmath23 . to the lowest order ,",
    "namely @xmath24 , the feynman diagram for the decay process @xmath0 is sketched in fig.1 .",
    "the partial decay rate in the rest frame of sigma is given in terms of the lorentz - invariant matrix element @xmath25 by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the pion momentum , @xmath28 and @xmath29 are respectively @xmath9- and @xmath14-mass . using an obvious notation for the @xmath25-matrix element , one has @xmath30 with @xmath31 here @xmath32 are fermionic matsubara frequencies , @xmath33 is the pseudoscalar interaction vertex .",
    "the quark propagator is denoted by @xmath34 with the quark energy @xmath35 . in eq.([aspp ] ) , @xmath36 refers to the trace over color , flavor and spinor indices .",
    "the pion - quark - quark and sigma - quark - quark coupling strengths in eq.([matrix ] ) are determined in the model via@xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the standard mesonic polarization functions@xcite for pion and sigma .",
    "the dynamically generated quark mass @xmath40 and the meson masses @xmath41 and @xmath42 are calculated using the usual gap equations@xcite in the hartree approximation for quarks and rpa approximation for mesons . after evaluation of the matsubara sum in eq.([aspp ] ) , one has@xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "sigma can decay into neutral and charged pions . by considering the exchange contribution for @xmath45 due to the identical particle effect",
    ", the total decay rate can be written as @xmath46 where we have taken into account the bose - einstein statistics in terms of the distribution function @xmath47 for the final state pions@xcite .    from the comparison of @xmath11 coupling strength @xmath48 defined through the lagrangian @xmath49 and the @xmath25-matrix element ( [ matrix ] ) in the njl model , we have @xmath50    in the numerical calculations we used the dynamical quark mass @xmath51 , the pion decay constant @xmath52 and the pion mass @xmath53 in the vacuum ( @xmath54 ) as input to determine the @xmath55 parameters in the njl model , namely the coupling constant @xmath56 , the momentum cutoff @xmath57 and the current quark mass @xmath58 .",
    "we first discuss the temperature dependence of @xmath48 and @xmath59 in the case of zero baryon density which corresponds to the central region of relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath48 is about @xmath60 in the vacuum and almost a constant in the temperature region @xmath61 , and then decreases smoothly with increasing temperature , as shown in fig.2 .",
    "the energy condition for the decay process @xmath0 to happen is @xmath62 in the rest frame of @xmath9 . at the threshold temperature @xmath63 determined by @xmath64",
    ", @xmath48 has a sudden jump from about @xmath65 to zero . in a wide temperature region",
    ", the decay rate ( [ rate2 ] ) goes up gradually from its vacuum value @xmath66 to the maximum @xmath67 at @xmath68 , then it drops down rapidly but continuously and becomes zero at the threshold temperature .",
    "the fact that the maximum decay rate is not in the vacuum where the mass difference between @xmath9 and @xmath14 has the largest value , but at @xmath68 is beyond our expectation .",
    "it originates from the important bose - einstein statistics of the final state pions at high temperatures .",
    "this can be seen clearly in fig.2 where we show the decay rates with and without consideration of the bose - einstein statistics .",
    "the rapid decrease of @xmath59 at high temperatures is due to the behavior of @xmath48 and the phase space factor @xmath69 .",
    "the density dependence of @xmath48 and @xmath59 is shown in fig.3 . since the threshold temperature for @xmath9 decay decreases with increasing chemical potential , the crucial bose - einstein statistics effect at high temperatures",
    "is gradually washed out as the chemical potential goes up .",
    "there is almost no difference between with and without such statistics when @xmath70 . instead of the statistics the first - order chiral transition dominates the behavior of @xmath48 and @xmath59 at high densities .",
    "when the system passes through the first - order transition line from the chirally symmetric phase to the broken phase , all the masses , @xmath71 and @xmath28 are discontinuous , @xmath72 and @xmath28 jump up and @xmath29 jumps down .",
    "therefore , the mass difference between @xmath9 and @xmath14 has a jump from less than @xmath73 to larger than @xmath73 , and the @xmath9 decay starts not at the threshold , but at some value beyond the threshold .",
    "this means that the decay in the first - order transition region happens suddenly with a nonzero rate , the temperature dependence of the decay rate behaves like a step function .",
    "this is shown in fig.3 for @xmath74 .",
    "when approaching to the endpoint @xmath8 from the first - order transition side , the jump of the mass difference disappear .",
    "the decay rate becomes continuous , while the coupling strength has still a jump .    to see the parameter dependence of the above discussion",
    ", we considered another set of parameters , @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "it makes shifts of the magnitudes of @xmath48 and @xmath59 , but does not change their shapes , especially the behavior around the threshold temperature or the chiral phase transition point .",
    "let s summarize the calculations of the @xmath9 decay rate .",
    "when the chemical potential is extremely high , the first - order chiral transition results in an almost temperature - independent decay rate .",
    "for most of the decay processes in the crossover region , the maximum decay rate does not locate in the vacuum , but is very close to the threshold point .",
    "only when the chemical potential is around @xmath77 which is close to the endpoint @xmath8 , the decay rate increases continuously and not very fast in the beginning , and then it behaves like a constant . as we discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the freeze - out of the pions may occur after @xmath9 decay . according to the decay rate shown in fig.3 ,",
    "when the decay happens in the first - order transition region or most of the places in the crossover region in the @xmath7 plane , a large fraction of @xmath9 s may decay into pions before the freeze - out , and these pions are thus thermalized before their freeze - out , only those pions generated after the freeze - out contribute to the nonthermal enhancement .",
    "however , when the @xmath9 decay happens with @xmath78 , most of the pions may be produced after the freeze - out , and therefore , there may be a strong nonthermal enhancement in this case . in the next section",
    "we discuss the nonthermal enhancement quantitatively .",
    "before we calculate the pion numbers with the @xmath9 decay rate as a function of temperature @xmath2 and chemical potential @xmath3 given in the last section , we need to treat @xmath79 as time - dependent . in the baryon - free ( @xmath80 ) region of relativistic heavy ion collisions ,",
    "the bjorken s scaling hydrodynamics@xcite is often used to describe the space - time evolution of hadronic thermodynamics .",
    "the time dependence of temperature in this scenario is given by @xmath81 with @xmath82 .",
    "here we have defined @xmath83 to be the time at which @xmath9 decay begins and the threshold temperature @xmath84 satisfies the mass relation @xmath85 .",
    "we will be interested in times @xmath86 .",
    "in hydrodynamic models@xcite the initial time corresponding to the highest temperature of the fluid is normally taken to be @xmath87 .",
    "since the sigma decay starts in the early stage of the fluid , we choose @xmath88 in our numerical calculations .    for heavy ion collisions with full nuclear stopping ,",
    "the lifetime of the baryon - rich fluid is much shorter compared with that of the baryon - free fluid , the space evolution can be considered as a homogeneous 3-dimensional expansion ( [ expansion ] ) with @xmath89 instead of @xmath90 .",
    "the real relativistic heavy ion collisions are between these two limits .",
    "we still use the expansion mechanism([expansion ] ) as the time dependence of temperature for any chemical potential @xmath3 , but the exponent @xmath91 is now @xmath3-dependent and parameterized by @xmath92 with @xmath93 . here",
    "the maximum chemical potential @xmath94 corresponding to the full stopping limit is chosen as @xmath95 in the njl model .    with the known decay rate @xmath96 and the relation between temperature and time for any chemical potential , the number of @xmath9 s present at time",
    "@xmath97 is determined by @xmath98 and is therefore @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the maximum number at the beginning time @xmath83 , @xmath101 with the @xmath9 energy @xmath102 and the volume @xmath103 of the system at time @xmath83 .",
    "since each sigma yields two pions , the number of pions generated by @xmath9 decay at time @xmath97 is related to the number of sigma by @xmath104 as the time @xmath105 , @xmath106 , sigma disappears , and the pion number reaches its maximum @xmath107 .",
    "the conventional definition for freeze - out is that the time between two successful scattering events is larger than the collective expansion time scale@xcite , @xmath108 @xmath109 can be calculated@xcite from the thermally averaged @xmath10 cross section@xcite in the njl model , and @xmath110 is simply reduced to @xmath111 in the scaling hydrodynamics@xcite .",
    "thus the freeze - out time @xmath112 and the freeze - out temperature @xmath113 are determined by @xmath114 and the expansion mechanism ( [ expansion ] ) .",
    "with the two temperature scales @xmath84 and @xmath113 we can divide the total pions generated by @xmath9 decay into thermal and nonthermal pions . for @xmath115 ,",
    "the produced pions in the interval @xmath116 have time to thermalize before the freeze - out , they lead to an enhancement of thermal pions , while in the interval @xmath117 the produced pions do not get a chance to thermalize , they result in a nonthermal enhancement of pions with low momentum .",
    "for @xmath118 , @xmath9 decay yields no thermal pions , all the resulted pions are nonthermal pions .",
    "the thermal and nonthermal enhancements are defined as ratios of the numbers of the pions produced by @xmath9 decay before and after the freeze - out to the number of the pions produced directly by the freeze - out of the original thermal pion gas , @xmath119 where @xmath120 is determined by the freeze - out temperature @xmath113 , the volume of the system at time @xmath112 , and the pion energy @xmath121 , @xmath122 obviously the measurable thermal and nonthermal enhancements are @xmath123 and @xmath124 .    with the in - medium pion momentum @xmath125 , the expansion mechanism ( [ expansion ] ) , and the pion distribution ( [ pion ] ) , we determine the normalized momentum distribution of the nonthermal pions , @xmath126 and the observable mean momentum of the nonthermal pions , @xmath127 since it is difficult to separate out the nonthermal pions experimentally , we calculate also the normalized momentum spectra of the total pions including the direct pions , the thermal pions from sigma decay , and the nonthermal pions from sigma decay , @xmath128 where we have used @xmath129 in the scaling hydrodynamics@xcite , and @xmath130 is defined as @xmath131    we now discuss our numerical calculations about the thermal and nonthermal pion distributions .",
    "fig.4 shows the sigma number and pion number scaled by the corresponding maximum value , @xmath132 and the thermal and nonthermal enhancements @xmath133 and @xmath134 as functions of time scaled by the beginning time @xmath83 in the case of @xmath135 .",
    "the dashed line located at the freeze - out time @xmath112 separates the left thermal region and the right nonthermal region .",
    "@xmath136 of the @xmath9 s decay before the freeze - out , the rest decay into nonthermal pions after the freeze - out .",
    "the measurable thermal and nonthermal enhancements compared with the number of direct pions are @xmath137 and @xmath138 , respectively .    the measurable thermal , nonthermal and total pion enhancements @xmath139 are shown in fig . 5 as functions of chemical potential @xmath3 .",
    "at a first - order chiral transition point any particle undergoes a mass jump . at the low end of this jump , @xmath140 , @xmath9 decay",
    "is forbidden , while at the high end , @xmath141 , the decay begins with a nonzero rate .",
    "this sudden decay was shown in fig.3 . on the other hand",
    ", the large @xmath9 mass at the beginning of decay means a strong suppression of the sigma number @xmath142 which dominates the amplitudes of the enhancements , it drops down exponentially with increasing @xmath9-mass . compared with the decay happen in the crossover region where the decay begins with @xmath143 , the thermal and nonthermal pion enhancements are both washed away by the first - order chiral transition .",
    "this is clearly displayed in fig.5 .",
    "the enhancements start at the endpoint @xmath8 of the first - order transition line and develop in the crossover region . in a wide chemical potential interval , the total pion enhancement is very strong , @xmath144 .",
    "the shapes of the enhancements are mainly controlled by the decay rate shown in fig.3 .",
    "the nonthermal and total enhancements have their maximum values in the vicinity of the endpoint @xmath8 , this is in agreement with our qualitative analysis in the last section .",
    "the momentum distribution of the nonthermal pions is shown in fig.6 for four different chemical potentials .",
    "the nonthermal pions are always centralized in a very narrow momentum region around @xmath145 .",
    "this narrow distribution leads to a sharp peak in the momentum spectra for the total pions , shown in fig.7 . for low chemical potentials the nonthermal momenta and the most appropriate thermal momenta almost coincide , while for high chemical potentials the nonthermal peak is separated from the thermal peak obviously .",
    "the thermal peak is always smooth , but the nonthermal peak is always sharp .",
    "the mean momentum of the nonthermal pions is shown in fig.8 as a function of chemical potential . unlike the strong chemical potential dependence of the enhancements , especially around the endpoint @xmath8 , the mean momentum is almost a constant , @xmath146 .",
    "this value is not so small as the people expected before@xcite .",
    "our study on @xmath9 decay depends on both the chiral dynamics which determines the decay rate , and the expansion mechanism which is reflected in the time evolution of the temperature . to see which one is dominant in the above calculations , we have chosen different expansion parameters .",
    "we changed @xmath94 to control the chemical potential dependence of the expansion rate , and the beginning time @xmath83 of the decay .",
    "while the amplitudes of the measurable thermal and nonthermal enhancements change remarkably , their shapes , the total enhancement and the mean momentum are insensitive to the expansion parameters .",
    "the chiral symmetry restoration plays a crucial rule in these observable quantities .",
    "we even let the freeze - out temperature @xmath113 be the decay temperature @xmath84 , this means no thermal pions produced by @xmath9 decay , the mean momentum in this case decreases by less than @xmath147 only .",
    "since the @xmath9-mass goes up and the @xmath14-mass drops down as the hadronic system cools down , the more and more large mass difference between @xmath9 and @xmath14 leads to @xmath9 decay into two pions when the @xmath9-mass exceeds the threshold @xmath73 .",
    "these pions result in thermal enhancement when they are produced before the freeze - out and nonthermal enhancement when they are produced after the freeze - out .",
    "based on the two - flavor njl model we have presented a detailed analysis of the pion production at finite temperatures and densities , and discussed the relation between the decay and the chiral symmetry restoration , especially the crucial effect of the order of the chiral transition on the thermal and nonthermal enhancements .",
    "we have found that the chiral symmetry breaking and restoration control the pion enhancements of the system . at high densities",
    "the number of @xmath9 s at the beginning of their decay is strongly suppressed by the large @xmath9-mass , originating from the first - order chiral transition . compared with the large number of direct pions produced by the freeze - out of the thermal pion gas",
    ", there are almost neither thermal nor nonthermal pion enhancements . in practice ,",
    "the enhancements begin at the endpoint @xmath8 of the first - order chiral transition line and present only in the crossover region with high temperatures and low densities .",
    "the nonthermal enhancement in this region develops very fast in the early stage of the decay and reaches its maximum value in the vicinity of the endpoint @xmath8 . for a wide chemical potential interval , @xmath148 ,",
    "both the thermal and nonthermal enhancements are remarkably large due to the almost constant decay rate during the whole decay process .",
    "the maximum enhancement is @xmath149 which agrees well with the value @xmath150 estimated by simple statistics@xcite .",
    "while the total enhancement and the structure of the thermal and nonthermal enhancements seem insensitive to the expansion parameters we have chosen in the calculations , the amplitudes of the thermal and nonthermal enhancements depend strongly on the expansion mechanism . on the other hand , our results are derived in a particular chiral model .",
    "although we expect the characteristics of the enhancements to be of more general validity , the numerical results are of course model dependent .",
