    "another field theoretical methods use a generalization of the schrdinger equation in the form of the tomonaga  schwinger equation and in the form of a covariant hamiltonian formulation .",
    "irrespective of their foundation and motivation , the field theoretical models are using more or less phenomenology to fit data .",
    "well fitted and widely applied within these models are the boson exchange potentials .",

    "this constraint is met , one can attain the differences in the na scattering observables to the differences of the interactions off  shell .    a simple kinematical effect usually overlooked , but explicitly accounted for in our calculations , is that the full  folding approach calls for matrix elements of energy @xmath48 in the laboratory frame . in the limit of the free @xmath3 matrix for the nn interactions , the energy of the interacting pair in its c.m .",
    "is given by @xmath49 .",
    "therefore , the maximum energy of the pair in its c.m . is @xmath48 , the energy of the beam plus the average binding energy of the target nucleons .",

    "this more demanding sampling of the nn effective interaction is a result of the unconstrained kinematics allowed by the fermi motion of the nucleons in the nucleus .",

    "this weak sensitivity to differences off  shell of completely different nn bare potentials suggests that the full  folding model can not unambiguously discriminate among on  shell equivalent nn potentials .",
    "furthermore , this equivalence indicates that a determining element in the nn potential is its on  shell content .",
    "indeed , we have tested this by taking a restricted energy range ( 0 - 400 mev ) for the nn phase  shifts to construct the inversion potential . in this case",
    ", the off - shell content of the inversion potential is different as reflected by the differences observed in the na scattering observables , more significantly above 200 mev .",
    "we have also considered a 03 gev energy range for the genuine paris phase  shifts to construct the inversion potential . in this case",
    "we observed no further differences with respect to those observed when using the 01.3 gev energy range .",
    "these results indicate that nn potentials which closely accounts for the nn phase ",
    "shift data over a wide energy range one would be able to assess the level of completeness of the optical model for na scattering .",
    "the relatively weak sensitivity to the off  shell effects suggest that nn potentials , constructed by means of the inversion scheme and following closely the nn data are meaningful and would provide predictions for the full  folding model very close to what would it be obtained from first principle nn potentials with comparable fit to the data .      to illustrate the degree of sensitivity of the @xmath35 matrix upon alternative choices of bare nn potentials , we have calculated selected matrix elements relevant for the leading contribution to the optical potential .",
    "thus , we consider diagonal @xmath14matrix elements , i.e. @xmath80 . in the context of the free @xmath3 matrix ( @xmath81 ) this",
    "kinematics implies the on  shell relative momentum occurs for @xmath82 . since @xmath83 is in general independent of both @xmath84 and @xmath56 , the resulting function corresponds to off ",

    "this is a good example to show the differences generally observed in most of the states for the effective interactions . in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we show the corresponding matrix elements , both real and imaginary components , for @xmath56= 30 , 200 and 400 mev .",
    "the solid and the dashed curves represent results from the paris and the paris inversion potentials respectively .    since the paris potential and its inversion are equivalent on  shell , the solid and dashed curves for the @xmath3 matrix ( @xmath59=0 ) must intercept each other at @xmath82 in both their real and imaginary components .",
    "this fact is indeed the case in the figures shown here as the on  shell constraint is explicitly built in the inversion method ; this is not necessarily the case , however , for the @xmath35 matrix as the propagator differs from that in free space by the presence of pauli blocking and the self  consistent fields .",
    "it is interesting to note the different asymptotic behavior ( @xmath86 ) between the paris and the inversion potential for both @xmath59=0 and @xmath59=1 @xmath5 .",
    "whereas all curves tend to zero as k increases , the one corresponding to the real part of the @xmath35 matrix for the paris potential does not .",
    "this result is consistent with the explicit momentum dependence introduced in the parameterization of the paris potential , feature which becomes dominant at high momenta .",
    "the extent to which this distinctive behavior is significant in the dynamics of the collision of the projectile with the nucleus needs to be assessed in the context of the elastic scattering observables .    in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] we also observe that the plotted matrix elements usually differ utmost in a few percents around the on  shell values .",
    "this result is consistent with the differences we have already discussed at the level of the na observables .",
    "in this section we extend the idea of nn potentials obtained directly from nn phase  shifts through the quantum inversion method and its application to na scattering . for this purpose , we have calculated a nn inversion potential based on the sm94 phase ",
    "shift analysis of arndt and collaborators @xcite .",

    "shifts are needed .",
    "this sets a limit for the energy range at the pion production threshold ( @xmath50300 mev ) . however , our studies with the paris potential in sect .",
    "iii show that phase  shifts at much higher energies are required by the inversion method .    our approach is as follows .",
    "in order to account approximately for the trend with energy that phase  shifts have above pion production threshold , we have neglected the imaginary component of the phase  shifts and retained only their real components .",
    "thus we can construct a real nn inversion potential from a set of real phase  shifts .",
    "the range of energy considered for the inversion is 01.3 gev .",
    "although this approach becomes essentially qualitative , we expect that our calculations will provide a guidance on how the medium and short range parts of the nn interaction , as determined by more realistic phase  shifts , affect the description of na scattering in the intermediate energy region .",

    "[ f5 ] we present the phase  shifts as a function of the energy for some selected channels .",

    "the level of accuracy obtained is again excellent , as in the paris case discussed in sect .",
    "the other point of physical significance is the clear departure of the paris phase  shifts from , at least , the real part of the experimental ones above pion production threshold .",

    "[ f6 ] we show the differential cross  section and analyzing power ( @xmath77 ) results for p + @xmath0ca at 40 mev .",
    "the full line corresponds to the results from the inversion potential and the dashed curve to results from the paris inversion one . in this and",
    "following figures we include as reference the calculations done with paris inversion potentials to have a clear comparison of the differences that may be observed . in the scheme we have followed",
    ", these differences would come directly from the different underlying set of nn phase ",
    "shifts used .",
    "the results in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] at 40 mev show , however , little difference .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that both potentials are comparable in their agreement with the nn data below pion production threshold ( see fig .",
    "[ f5 ] ) . still , some small sensitivity of the order of 5 % in the observables is observed .",
    "since both potentials are constructed following exactly the same inversion procedure , we conclude that phase ",
    "shifts above 300 mev still determine properties of the nn potentials which affect low ",
    "energy na scattering .",
    "these small , mostly off  shell , differences stay in even at much smaller energies in many ",
    "body systems .",
    "we have pursued these calculations at higher energies . in fig .",
    "[ f7 ] we present the results for p + @xmath0ca at 200 and 300 mev .",
    "the meaning of the curves is the same as in fig .",
    "[ f6 ] and the data was taken from ref .",
    "@xcite at 200 mev and from ref .",
    "@xcite at 300 mev . at these energies",
    "we start noting a marked departure in the predictions of the two inversion potentials , with a tendency of the potential constructed from the nn phase ",
    "shift data to be relatively closer to the na scattering data .",
    "this result reflects the disagreement existing between the data and the paris potential phase",

    "our findings are confirmed with calculations for p + @xmath0ca at 400 and 500 mev .",
    "these results are shown in fig .",

    "certainly , applications of the paris ( or its inverse ) potential at 400 mev and above constitute an extrapolation of the model .",
    "nevertheless , these applications serve us to illustrate both the role of the nn phase  shifts above pion production threshold in determining the nn potential and the ability of the inversion method to capture that physics .",
    "the differences given by the two potentials in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] are remarkable .",
    "in particular , it is notable the improvement obtained in describing the na scattering observables with the inversion potential constructed from the sm94 data , mainly for @xmath871 @xmath5 in both d@xmath88/d@xmath89 and a@xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , uncertainties associated with the off  shell behavior of the nn potential are smaller than the departure of the inversion potentials from the paris to the sm94 data .",
    "this indicates that the improvement in the description of the na data is a direct consequence of an improved account for the nn data , mainly above pion production threshold , a built  in feature in the inversion potential .",
    "in this paper we have addressed the problem of how properties of the underlying nn bare interaction determines the dynamics of a many  nucleon system .",
    "our approach for the nn force is based on the quantum inversion method where a local , static , channel dependent potential is constructed directly from the nn phase  shifts . by departing from nn potentials derived from a field theoretical",
    "approach and empirically modified to maximize the fit to nn data below pion production threshold , we expect to shed new light on these properties of the nn force relevant to many",
    " body processes .    we have investigated effects associated with the genuine off ",
    "shell behavior of bare nn potentials which are equivalent from the point of view of the phase ",
    "shifts over a wide energy range .",
    "the generation of on  shell  equivalent potentials was based on the gelfand  levitan and marchenko inversion method for the nn system .",
    "applications were made with the paris potential , where the inversion method was applied to its corresponding phase ",
    "shifts up to 1.3 gev kinetic energy in the nn laboratory system .",
    "this fairly large energy range was required to have the off  shell behavior of the inversion potential being determined mainly by the theory and not by the choice of a particular set of phase  shifts .",
    "the corresponding nn effective interactions were found to exhibit sizable differences off  shell , particularly for relative momenta above 3 @xmath5 in the nn system .",
    "the investigation of these differences was made in the context of na elastic scattering with the calculation of _ in  medium _ full  folding optical potentials for proton scattering from @xmath0ca and @xmath1pb and at beam energies between 40 and 400 mev .",
    "we found a weak sensitivity of the na scattering observables to the off  shell differences observed between the nn effective interactions provided the underlying bare nn potentials are equivalent on  shell .",
    "these differences , at most 10% at the level of the na scattering observables , are present in the whole energy range .",
    "one striking aspect is the ability of the inversion method to generate an nn potential which is , essentially , physically equivalent to its original counterpart although , by construction , their analytic properties and asymptotic behavior are very different .",
    "based on the success of the inversion method , we have constructed inversion nn potentials based on the sm94 phase  shift analysis .",
    "these potentials have been applied to the calculation of full  folding optical potentials for proton elastic scattering from @xmath0ca in the 40500 mev energy range .",
    "we obtained results for the scattering observables which yield a fit to the na scattering data at 40 mev comparable to that obtained with the paris potential .",
    "however , a departure from the paris results appears above 200 mev , with a clear improvement of the na scattering data being achieved in the 400 and 500mev applications .",
    "this improvement comes as a direct consequence of the closer agreement between the inversion potential and the nn phenomenology .",
    "an important conclusion emerging from our studies is that bare nn potentials which only provide a fit to nn phase ",
    "shifts below pion production threshold and disregard their higher energy behavior are unlikely to be realistic candidates to describe nucleon ",
    "nucleon dynamic in the nuclear medium .",
    "despite the improvements in the description of na scattering using inversion potentials from nn data , difficulties still remain in describing the na scattering data at momentum transfers below 1 @xmath5 .",
    "we believe the explicit treatment inelasticities of the nn interaction above pion production threshold and baryon excitation mechanisms need to be addressed as the inversion potentials from the sm94 analysis were restricted to the real part of the phase ",
    "shifts only . on the other hand , in the lower energy applications we observe a systematic inability of the full  folding model to describe in greater detail the na scattering data . here ,",
    "the presence of higher order processes due to the many  body nature of the problem need definitely be accounted for .",
    "indeed , the results obtained at these energies using the paris potential , its inversion and the sm94 inversion provide essentially the same description of the na scattering data .",
    "therefore , we can not attain these limitations of the optical model to the uncertainties associated with the off  shell behavior of the nn interaction .",
