    "the flow pattern of thousand of particles produced in a heavy ion reaction is the main observable used to look for collective behaviour and its properties .",
    "these properties test the conditions necessary for the obtention of qgp .",
    "one is the degree of thermalization .",
    "the evolution of the matter from the initial conditions can be computed by means of relativistic hydrodynamics if local equilibrium is maintained .",
    "these equations can be further approximated by perfect fluid equation when the viscosity correction can be neglected .",
    "the second condition is the validity of the equation of state , numerically determined from qcd .",
    "the data on elliptic flow show evidence that a fast thermalization is reached at rhic energy , compatible with a soft equation of state and a low viscosity .",
    "the matter created at rhic behaves as a perfect fluid @xcite .",
    "the elliptic flow , @xmath0 , results from pressure gradients developed in the initial almond - shaped collision zone .",
    "that is , the initial transverse coordinate space anisotropy of the collision zone or eccentricity @xmath1 is converted , via hadronic or partonic interactions into an azimuthal momentum anisotropy .",
    "elliptic flow self - quenches due to expansion of the collision zone , therefore in order to achieve relatively large @xmath2 a fast thermalization is required ( see lisa and bai - yuting talks   @xcite   and  @xcite ) . therefore it is expected that the elliptic flow scaled by the eccentricity should be proportional to the density of scatterings , @xmath3 , being @xmath4 the overlapping collision area .",
    "this is well satisfied as fig .",
    "it is also shown the hydrodynamics result for a perfect fluid @xcite , which only is reached for central au - au collisions . as a for lhc , for central au - au collisions @xmath5 it is expected a change on the shape of the curve becoming flat . in fig .",
    "2 we show the agreement of the observed hadron mass dependence of @xmath2 with the hydrodynamics predictions below @xmath6 gev / c .",
    "this result shows that there is a common collective flow velocity.in fig .",
    "3 it is shown the scaling law of @xmath7 versus @xmath8 , @xmath9 being the number of quarks of the respective hadrons .",
    "this scaling law was predicted by coalescence models suggesting that the collective flow is at the partonic stage .",
    "the coalescence models , also explain naturally the differences between the inclusive cross sections for baryons and mesons at intermediate transverse momentum as it was explained in the hippolyte talk @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics perfect fluid prediction @xcite for the higher azimuthal momentum @xmath10 is @xmath11 , but the data for @xmath12 and @xmath13 and @xmath14 in minimum bias au - au collisions gives a factor @xmath15 instead @xmath16 .",
    "however in a perfect fluid model @xcite it is obtained the scaling law @xmath17 , which is in agreement with data .",
    "@xmath18 is a constant depending on the mass of the particle and @xmath19 .",
    "one of the exciting results of the rhic data is the strong suppression of @xmath20 in central heavy ion collisions , consistent with the predicted energy loss @xcite @xcite of the parent light quarks and gluons when transverse the dense colored medium due to the induced gluon radiation . in fig .",
    "4 is shown the nuclear attenuation factor @xmath21.for @xmath22 and @xmath23 the data show a suppression factor 5 for @xmath24 gev / c , compared to the superposition of @xmath25 collision , see n. borghini talk @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "@xmath26 for direct photons in agreement with perturbative qcd @xcite @xcite .",
    "however , the suppression factor for high @xmath20 electrons from semi - leptonic d and b decays is as suppressed as the light hadrons in central au - au collision @xcite , see fig . 5 , in conflict with the prediction of radiative energy loss models .",
    "this discrepancy may point out to a elastic energy loss for heavy quarks .",
    "the study of b and c jets at lhc can be very valuable to clarify this point .    a second exciting phenomena observed at rhic was the suppression of the back to back jet - like correlation .",
    "jet - like correlations are measured by selecting the highest @xmath20 trigger hadron of the event and measuring the azimuthal @xmath27 and rapidity @xmath28 distributions of associated hadrons . in @xmath29 collisions",
    "a dijet signal appears as two back to back gaussian peaks at @xmath30 ( near - side ) and @xmath31 ( away - side ) . on the contrary ,",
    "the away - side dihadron azimuthal correlation in central au - au collision is clearly suppressed , showing a dip and a double peak structure @xcite at @xmath32 , for associated hadron in the range @xmath33 ( see fig .",
    "this double peak structure has been pointed out as due to the emission of energy from the quenched parton at a finite angle respect to the jet axis .",
    "such conical configuration can appear if a fast jet moving in a fluid medium generates a wake of shock wave of mach type @xcite or cerenkov type @xcite . in the case of mach wave , the characteristic angle",
    "@xmath34 of the emitted secondaries determines the speed of sound , @xmath35 .",
    "however the double - peak structure of the away - side correlation is consistent not only with conical emission but also with other scenarios . in order to distinguish between the different mechanisms ,",
    "3-particle azimuthal correlations are needed .",
    "the three particle results reported at this conference @xcite as central au - au collisions are consistent with conical emission , but additional studies on the @xmath20 dependence are needed to emission distinguish between mach cone shock waves and cerenkov emission .",
    "early predictions were that the two heavy quarks that would form the bound state would be screened from each other in the high - density deconfined medium @xcite .",
    "these states would melt at different energy densities depending on their size and binding energies .",
    "however , recently , lattice qcd has suggested that the @xmath36 would not be screened up to @xmath37 . on the contrary other charmonium states would be screened around @xmath38 @xcite .    the @xmath36 suppression at rhic was predicted to be larger than the observed at sps by most of the models .",
    "contrary to this expectation , additional suppression was not found , fig .",
    "7 . in this figure",
    "it is also shown the suppression due to normal absorption using for the absorption cross section the values 1 , 3 and 4 mb respectively .",
    "the usual used value of 4.2 mb is higher than the required by @xmath39 data which is in the range 1 - 3 mb .",
    "a better understanding of the absorption cross section and in general of cold nuclear matter effects would be welcome .",
    "we are left with two possible theoretical explanations of the rhic data , namely regeneration @xcite and sequential dissociation @xcite models . in regeneration",
    "models a strong dissociation of the charm pairs due to screening is compensated by the regeneration of bound charm pairs in the later states of the expansion due to the large production of charmed quarks at high density . at lhc a large enhancement is predicted .    in the sequential screening model , the @xmath36 is not melt at sps and rhic energies as suggested by lattice calculations and the observed suppression comes only from screening of the higher mass resonances @xmath40 and @xmath41 that though feed down normally provide about",
    "40% of the @xmath36 production .",
    "this picture provides a simple explanation for the similar suppression observed at sps and rhic . as at lhc",
    "it would be reached temperatures high enough to dissociate @xmath36 , it is expected stronger suppression at lhc , contrary to the regeneration model expectation .    on the other hand , the sequential dissociation model relates the observed @xmath36 production to the higher resonance production once the absorption has been substracted .",
    "in fact , denoting by @xmath42 and @xmath43 , the survival probabilities for the observed total suppression and for the higher resonances respectively , once the absorption has been substracted    @xmath44    using the absorption cross sections @xmath45 and @xmath46 we can test the equation ( [ ec1 ] ) from the data on @xmath36 and @xmath40 production , obtaining a good agreement as it is shown in fig .",
    "lattice studies indicates that the deconfinement phase transition at @xmath47 is a cross over @xcite , as at @xmath48 it is expected to be of first order , in some point there will be a critical end point . at this conference , were reported studies both experimental and theoretical on this critical end point . from one side ,",
    "it was explained the proposal rhicii @xcite which will explore regions of lower energy , looking for signatures associated to the critical point . in this way",
    ", it will join fair in the search of the critical point . on the other hand",
    "were reported interesting theoretical results .",
    "b. kaempfer @xcite in a quasi - particle model on of qcd matter study the critical end point and the equation of state , obtaining with agreement for relevant observables of aa collisions as the elliptical flow for different particles or the rapidity multiplicity distribution .",
    "szabo reported the recent results of lattice at @xmath49 and @xmath48 , in particular the cross - over at @xmath50 .",
    "antonov analytically studied @xcite thermodynamics of a heavy quark - antiquark pair in su(3 ) qcd , both below and above the deconfinement critical temperature .",
    "he derived the effective temperature - dependent string tension , which enabled him to calculate internal energy and entropy of two heavy - light mesons for two flavours .",
    "the anomalously large peaks of these two observables around @xmath51 , observed recently on the lattice are well described .",
    "other interesting aspects of the phase transition ( dynamics , flux - tube ) were discussed by g. krein @xcite and g. kozlov @xcite .",
    "in the early stage of heavy ion collision an extended region with large energy density is produced where quark and gluons degrees of freedom leading to a new partonic phase of matter . in the subsequent evolution ,",
    "the system dilutes and cools down , hadronizes and finally decays into observed hadrons .",
    "these hadrons carry only indirect information about the early stage of the collision .",
    "results as the elliptic flow discussed before suggest that a deconfined phase starts in the early stage of the reaction .",
    "the study of correlation and fluctuations can provide additional information on the reaction mechanism .",
    "for these reasons correlations between oppositely charge particles and multiplicity and transverse momentum fluctuations have been measured in the last years .",
    "the balance function @xcite measured the correlation of the oppositively charged particles .",
    "the width of the balance function @xmath52 is sensitive to the hadronization time .",
    "if the system produced in a heavy - ion collision has undergone a partonic phase , the hadronization will occur at later time and therefore the temperature will be lower and the diffusive interaction with other particles will be lesser than those in the direct hadronization @xcite .",
    "a delayed hadronization implies stronger correlation in rapidity for the charged particles and therefore a narrower balance function .",
    "indeed a narrowing of the balance function is observed with increasing size of the colliding nuclei by the na49 and star collaboration @xcite .",
    "the hijing model as well as shuffled events retaining only correlations from global charge conservation do not show any decrease of the width .",
    "however , other models without delayed hadronization can describe the data @xcite .",
    "notice , that the integral of the balance function is related to the event by event charge fluctuations , which are expected to be suppressed in a qgp @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity correlations have been studied by the na49 correlations @xcite . in fig .",
    "9 , the scaled variance of negative particles is shown as a function of the number of projectile participants together with the results of three different string models .",
    "it has been pointed out that for peripheral collisions a significant contribution comes from fluctuations in the number of target participants at fixed projectile participant number , what means that the projectile and target hemisphere are connected .",
    "the strings models of fig .",
    "9 are based on fritiof model where the strings are stretched between partons of the same excited hadron and therefore there is not connection between hemispheres .",
    "this does not happen in string models like , dual parton model , quark gluon string model and venus where there is color exchange and the strings are stretched between partons of the projectile and the target .    in fig .",
    "10 it is shown the result of a percolation color sources model @xcite together with previous na49 data .",
    "it is seen that contrary to the above string models in this case reproduced the general trend of data .",
    "the percolation framework is able to describe the dependence on the centrality of the transverse momentum fluctuations @xcite . in this approach the strings stretched between partons of the projectile and target . in the transverse space",
    "these color strings are seen as small circles , with @xmath53 . with growing energy and/or atomic number , the number of strings grows , starting to overlap forming clusters .",
    "each cluster decay into particles with a mean multiplicity and mean transverse momentum which depends on the number of strings of the cluster and the total area of the cluster .",
    "these dependence are essentially determined by the schwinger mechanism and the color field of each cluster . at a certain critical density ,",
    "a macroscopic cluster appear which marks the percolation phase transition @xcite .",
    "the fluctuations are understood as follows : at low density , most of the particles are produced by individual strings with the same mean multiplicity and mean @xmath20 , therefore small fluctuations . at large density above the critical point",
    "essentially there will be only are cluster and therefore the fluctuations are small .",
    "the maximum of fluctuations corresponds to the largest number of clusters with different size and number of strings .",
    "the percolation of strings predicts that the long range rapidity correlation measured by @xmath54 ( between forward f and backward b the rapidity gap should be larger than 1 - 1.5 to eliminate short range correlations ) increases with centrality , being much less than what is expected from superposition models @xcite .",
    "this is in agreement with star preliminary data @xcite .    in color glass condensate(cgc)@xcite",
    "we expect also that @xmath55 grows with the centrality @xcite .",
    "in fact , the main contribution is given by    @xmath56    as centrality increases , @xmath57 decreases and ( [ ec2 ] ) grows .",
    "it is clear that a fast thermalization of the partonic is required .",
    "we learned at beginning of the conference @xcite that this can be achieved naturally in the cgc approach . in this approach ,",
    "the collision of two heavy ion , which are gluon saturated in the initial state , develop strong longitudinal chromoelectric fields @xcite , which via the schwinger mechanism produce particles with a thermal spectrum due to the fluctuations of the color field .",
    "the temperature t of this spectrum is related to the saturation momentum @xmath58 .",
    "the thermalization time is @xmath59 .",
    "as it has pointed out @xcite , a similar picture arises in percolation @xcite . in this case",
    ", the critical density @xmath60 for the non - thermal percolation phase can be related to the critical temperature , @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the mean transverse momentum of particles produced in one single string ( essentially the string tension ) and @xmath63 has geometrical origin and has to do with the fraction of total avalaible area occupied by the cluster @xmath64 .",
    "the shear viscosity is @xmath65 is also determined by the same factor .",
    "l is the longitudinal extension , @xmath66 . for reasonable values of @xmath67 and @xmath68 ,",
    "it is obtained @xmath69 and a very low shear viscosity .    in conclusion ,",
    "theoretical and experimental progress have been achieved in the understanding of deconfinement as it has been reported in the different talks of this session .",
    "the future experiments of lhc , fair and we expect that also rhic ii will let us to go on this understanding , and clarify some of the questions of the field .",
    "we thank the organizers for such a nice meeting and y. foka , j. rafelski and m. leith for helping in the configuration of this talk .",
    "the work has done under contract fpa2005 - 01963 of spain and the support of xunta de galicia ."
