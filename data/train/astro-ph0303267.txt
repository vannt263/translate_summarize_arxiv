    "rich clusters offer an unique laboratory for studying the effects of the local environment on their constituent galaxies .",
    "evidence has accumulated in recent years that environmental processes affect both the star formation and morphological characteristics of galaxies , the endpoint being the present - day morphology - density relation ( dressler 1980 ) .",
    "however , the nature and timescale of the relevant evolutionary processes remains unclear .",
    "as clusters represent concentrations of both dark and baryonic matter , the physical interplay between the observed properties of a galaxy and the cluster potential is likely complex .",
    "an important advance was the recognition that the hot intercluster gas observed in x - rays may significantly affect the star formation rate of recently - arrived infalling galaxies ( gunn & gott 1972 ) , possibly triggering star formation by compressing their gas clouds or quenching star formation by stripping their gas reservoir ( dressler & gunn 1983 ; byrd & valtonen 1990 ; evrard 1991 ; fujita 1998 ; abadi et al .",
    "1999 )    much progress has followed the connection of hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging of clusters with deep ground based spectroscopy .",
    "the former is essential in providing galaxy morphologies at epochs where environmental processes can be witnessed , while the latter is essential in providing diagnostic information on the timescales of star formation and its recent truncation .",
    "the combination has been most powerful in understanding the origin of the increase with redshift in the fraction of blue members seen in cluster cores between @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( butcher & oemler 1978 , 1984 ) .",
    "several hst - based studies have demonstrated that the blue galaxies seen at @xmath100.3 are largely star - forming spirals which are noticeably absent in present - day clusters .",
    "it has been proposed these are recent arrivals in the cluster , perhaps observed immediately prior to a removal of their gas supply .",
    "importantly , some red cluster galaxies in the same clusters show evidence of recently truncated star formation ( dressler et al .  1994 ;",
    "couch et al . 1994 ; stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1995 ) .",
    "the above cluster studies have been undertaken alongside similar hst - based campaigns devoted to the study of the _ field galaxy population _",
    "( glazebrook et al .  1995 ; brinchmann et al .  1998 ; cohen et al .",
    "2000 ) . broadly speaking",
    ", these studies have likewise demonstrated an increase in gas content and star formation rate with redshift although mostly in lower mass systems than those discussed in the cluster studies .",
    "the extent to which the evolutionary trend seen in the field drives that observed in clusters is thus an interesting and relevant question .",
    "much of what has been learned thus far concerning the evolution of galaxies in clusters has been derived from detailed studies in the inner @xmath11 mpc of several clusters , typically spanning a range in redshift ( smail et al .",
    "1997 ; van dokkum et al . 1998a ; oke , postman & lubin 1998 ) .",
    "only couch et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and van dokkum et al.(1998b ) secured morphological data beyond a radius of 1 mpc via a wfpc2 mosaic .",
    "although an efficient strategy in generating a large sample of spectroscopic members , information is only provided on the later states of the environmental processes .",
    "important results have emerged including the relative abundances of elliptical and lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies as a function of redshift ( dressler et al .",
    "1997 ; andreon et al . 1998 ; fabricant et al .",
    "2000 ) and the homogeneity in the colors of the e / s0 population ( ellis et al .  1997 ; stanford , eisenhardt & dickinson 1998 ; van dokkum et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "a major problem that arises in developing a self - consistent evolutionary picture from observations made with a variety of clusters is the difficulty of assigning timescales to the phenomena observed , and connecting clusters at different redshifts into a temporal sequence .",
    "in fact , we have evidence that clusters evolve continuously by merging and accreting structures from the surrounding field ( e.  g. zabludoff & franx 1993 ; abraham et al . 1996a ; balogh et al .",
    "2000 ) as described in popular theories of structure formation ( e.  g. kauffmann 1995a , b ; diaferio et al.2001 ) .",
    "therefore , we can not simply assume that a cluster observed for example at @xmath12 evolves `` passively '' to one observed at @xmath13 .",
    "our approach in this series will be to secure high quality data for a single well - studied system over a large range in environmental density . a more secure connection with the evolution observed in field samples",
    "may thus be assured and , as we will demonstrate , the timescale of the star formation activities can be more readily determined , e.  g. by estimating the likely dynamical trajectories of infalling galaxies .",
    "an important region which motivated the current study is that where infalling field galaxies first encounter the cluster potential and the intercluster gas .",
    "few studies have been devoted to the investigation of this region either in a statistical sense for an ensemble of clusters ( e.g. balogh et al .",
    "1999 ; pimbblet et al .",
    "2002 ) or for individual clusters ( abraham et al .",
    "1996a ; kodama et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in a seminal article , abraham et al .",
    "( 1996b ) examined this region via moderate signal - to - noise ratio spectroscopy to @xmath14 mpc in abell 2390 .",
    "an extensive wide - field redshift survey separating field and cluster members to large radius was central to progress in this respect enabling the first measures of the radial gradients of diagnostic spectral features .",
    "unfortunately , the spectroscopic data was marginal in terms of that required for studies of individual galaxies , and no hst data was available so a connection with morphology was not possible .",
    "our series is concerned with developing and extending the analysis of abraham et al .",
    "( 1996b ) for a single cluster , cl0024 + 16 ( @xmath15=0.4 ) , for which an extensive hst mosaic has been obtained .",
    "the present paper is primarily concerned with introducing and interpreting the morphological data enabled by our hst wfpc2 observations in the context of available spectroscopic data .",
    "a plan of the paper follows : in @xmath162 we summarize the scientific goals which motivate the series and , in turn , define the necessary observational data .",
    "we then introduce the observational data .",
    "in @xmath163 we describe the strategy for the adopted hst observations , the data reduction techniques and the production of a catalog that will serve the entire survey .",
    "we define the basis of our morphological classifications performed to a limiting magnitude of @xmath4 and discuss issues of completeness and bias .",
    "this catalog is merged with the available and new spectroscopic data in @xmath164 .    in preparation for the subsequent analysis of the data , in @xmath165 we review the various physical mechanisms proposed to explain the relation between morphology and environment .",
    "an important output of this discussion which guides the later analysis are physical length scales and timescales associated with the various mechanisms which define how we will analyze and interpret the data in cl0024 + 16 , both as a function of cluster radius and environmental density . in @xmath166",
    "we analyze the properties of the cluster galaxy population , both as a function of cluster centric radius and with local projected density , i.e. the t - r and t-@xmath5 relations .",
    "contrasting the trends seen in these two relations allows us to interpret the changes in morphology in the context of specific processes introduced in @xmath165 .",
    "section  [ sec : sum ] summarizes the results and our main conclusions .    throughout the series",
    ", we assume the hubble constant , the matter density , and the cosmological constant are h@xmath17  kms@xmath18mpc@xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "hence , at the distance of cl0024 + 16 ( @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath23 kpc , the bolometric distance modulus is @xmath24 , and the look - back time is 4.6 gyrs . finally , @xmath25 is the radial coordinate in 3-d space , while @xmath26 is the radial coordinate in 2-d projected space .",
    "we are undertaking a wide - field hst survey , coupled with suitable ground - based spectroscopy , for a single cluster at intermediate redshift .",
    "the unique feature is adequate morphological and spectroscopic data from the core to the turnaround radius where field galaxies begin their infall .",
    "the key scientific goals are : to determine the mix of galaxy morphologies as function of cluster radius and local density ; to measure the total cluster mass radial profile beyond the virial radius using weak lensing signals derived from background galaxies ; to determine the star formation properties of cluster members via diagnostic spectroscopy ; to connect these to their morphological and kinematic properties , and to interactions with the intercluster medium ( icm ) ; consolidate the above results via a unified picture for the transformation of the physical properties and morphologies of galaxies .    whether such an ambitious list of goals can be uniquely realized via",
    "the detailed study of only a single cluster is of course unclear . of necessity , given the challenge of obtaining such a wide body of hst and ground - based data , it is the logical place to start . experience has shown that most astronomical objects/ systems when studied in considerable detail exhibit unforeseen peculiarities .",
    "for example , the progressive increase in dynamical data for local cluster galaxies has usually revealed that systems previously considered to be dynamically relaxed exhibit perceptable substructure ( dressler & shectman 1988 ) .",
    "studies based on the statistical properties of member galaxies as a function of cluster radius must be analyzed with caution in such circumstances .",
    "this would argue for studying several targets and adopting some form of scaling law for combining data from different systems ( van der marel et al .",
    "2000 ) . on the other hand , at large radii , it is conceivable that substructures are a dominant feature of infall patterns which need to be understood rather than averaged out .",
    "cl0024 + 16 has a number of features that make it optimal for this study ( c.f .",
    "table  1 ) .",
    "there is a wealth of observational data , including the extensive spectroscopic survey of czoske et al .",
    "the choice of an intermediate redshift ( @xmath0 ) has many advantages .",
    "it ensures the presence of gas rich field galaxies whose infall is thought to influence the evolution observed in cluster cores .",
    "a large physical area can be observed with a relatively small number of wfpc2 pointings .",
    "morphologies and high quality spectra of representative @xmath27 galaxies can be obtained in economic exposure times with hst and keck respectively .",
    "the cluster is also optimally placed along the line of sight to typical faint ( @xmath2825 ) background galaxies for the measurement and interpretation of weak lensing signals induced by the cluster .",
    "the presence of a multiply - imaged strong lensing feature of known redshift at the cluster center ( broadhurst et al .",
    "2000 ) provides an important absolute calibration of the mass model .",
    "we secured a large wide - field mosaic of hst images for cl0024 + 16 through a dedicated program ( hst program 8559 : pi ellis ) .",
    "hst images were collected from fall 2000 to fall 2001 and form the subject of the first papers of this series , which describe the measurement of the mass profile of the cluster using the wfpc2 and stis images ( kneib et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) , and the measurement of the size of the halos of cluster galaxies using galaxy - galaxy lensing methods ( natarajan et al .",
    "2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "later papers will describe the results of further keck spectroscopy of selected members as a means of investigating the star formation characteristics as a function of cluster environment .",
    "we now introduce the wide field wfpc2 imaging dataset for cl0024 + 16 . after defining the strategy which motivated the hst observations (   [ ssec : wfpc2strat ] ) , we describe the data reduction procedures (   [ ssec : wfpc2red ] ) which lead to two key products : a photometric object catalog (   [ ssec : wfpc2cat ] ) with morphological classification (   [ ssec : wfpc2morph ] ) , which we will refer to as the wfpc2 catalog .      in order to probe both the transition and peripheral regions of the cluster ( see @xmath16  [ ssec:2d ] ) , a sparse - sampled pattern of wfpc2 fields was necessary .",
    "we defined a circle of diameter @xmath29 ( @xmath710 mpc ) and arranged 38 non - contiguous pointings which , together with earlier archival data , fully cover the center and sample the periphery at @xmath3030% area coverage .",
    "this strategy ensures we cover the required range of environments and cluster radius for the galaxy population studies .",
    "the arrangement was also chosen to permit azimuthal - averaging of fields for radial trends , e.g. for the weak shear profile ( c.f .",
    "kneib et al .",
    "2003 for a discussion of the observational strategy as defined from the lensing goals ) .",
    "a list of pointings , coordinates and orientations is given in table  [ tab : pointings ] and the field distribution is portrayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] . in the original approved schedule , the wfpc2 field positions and orientations were carefully chosen to ensure some overlap of parallel stis observations .",
    "the higher spatial resolution of stis can be used to great advantage in calibrating the wfpc2 point spread function for weak lensing studies . unfortunately",
    ", for scheduling reasons , this carefully constructed plan had to be abandoned , and , in order to safeguard completing the survey prior to the launch of acs , we had to discard all orientation restrictions on the wfpc2 pointings soon after observations commenced .",
    "all wfpc2 images were taken in the f814w filter providing photometry for cluster members which approximates the rest - frame v - band ( hereafter , for simplicity , we will refer to f814w as @xmath31 ) .",
    "the filter choice was motivated by the need for an adequately faint sample of background galaxies for the weak lensing analyses , while ensuring adequate comparisons with existing and ongoing studies of intermediate redshift galaxies ( e.g. dressler et al .",
    "1997 ; brinchmann et al.1998 ) . at each position ,",
    "four equal exposures totaling two hst orbits ( 4000s-4400s , see tab  [ tab : pointings ] ) were dithered with a @xmath32 grid with half - integer offsets .",
    "for the central field ( pos00 ) , we utilized the image originally analyzed by colley et al .",
    "( 1996 ) referred to in the morphs collaboration ( smail et al.1997 ) ( go : 5453 , pi : turner ) whose exposure time was 18,000s in f814w and 25,200s in f450w .",
    "we implemented a pipeline based on the iraf package dither ( fruchter & hook 2002 ) to reduce the wfpc2 data .",
    "the pipeline cleans and combines the images , by iteratively refining the measurement of relative offsets and the cosmic rays / defect identification ( the algorithm is similar to the one described by fruchter & mutchler 1998 ) .",
    "the output of the pipeline consists of two sets of images , one with a pixel size equal to the original pixels size ( @xmath33 for the wf chips ) , and one with pixel size half the original ( @xmath34 for pc chips ) .",
    "an exposure time map is produced for each chip .",
    "the quality of the combined images was carefully checked by visual inspection of all the intermediate steps of the pipeline and by a variety of quality checks including requirements on the homogeneity of the exposure time maps to ensure homogeneous photometry , and on the sharpness of the point spread function ( the gaussian - fwhm of stars as measured with imexam was generally slightly better in the combined images than in the original ones , due to better sampling ) .",
    "the photometric catalog derived from the wfpc2 images will be used for most subsequent applications in the series of papers , from the morphological classification discussed later in this paper , to the identification of background samples for weak lensing studies ( kneib et al .",
    "2003 ; natarajan et al .",
    "2003 ) , and later for target selections for the spectroscopic campaigns .",
    "a reliable catalog with few spurious detections and well - understood completeness characteristics is essential .",
    "a high degree of completeness at the faintest limits ( @xmath35 ) is less important than a well - understood completeness function because weak lensing signals depend on the angular size of a faint galaxy and can not uniformly be detected in faint galaxies of a given apparent magnitude ( e.  g. bacon , refregier & ellis 2000 ) .",
    "faint object identifications were performed using the source extractor algorithm sextractor ( bertin & arnouts 1996 ) , one of the standard packages for this purpose ( e.  g. , casertano et al .",
    "2000 ) . after some experimentation",
    ", it was decided to adopt detection criteria similar to those used by the morphs collaboration above 24.6 mag arcsec@xmath36 for the wf chips , @xmath37 above 23.6 mag arcsec@xmath36 for the pc .",
    "photometric zero points were taken from the hst data handbook . ] .",
    "the deblending threshold and contrast parameters were set to 32 and 0.03 respectively , ensuring nearby sources are separated while fainter objects that appear part of the same system ( e.  g. , bright knots on spiral arms ) are preserved as a single entity .",
    "these choices affect completeness somewhat at the faintest magnitudes  @xmath3 in our case ",
    "( c.f . discussion in casertano",
    "2000 ) , but will not affect the results discussed in this paper , which are mostly concerned with the brighter galaxies .",
    "the catalog does not include the area of reduced sensitivity covered by the pc which represents only a modest fraction of the total area .",
    "a basic measure of catalog completeness can be determined from the i - band galaxy number counts after excluding duplications from overlapping fields ( fig .",
    "[ fig : numcou ] ) .",
    "although obviously a clustered field , excluding the data from the central pos00 , the cl0024 + 16 counts are only modestly above those of genuine field samples , mostly at @xmath38 ; this gives a measure of the challenge of locating cluster members at large radii .",
    "the turnover fainter than @xmath39 serves as an indicator of the limiting depth of our catalog .",
    "as expected , the central pos00 field ( red stars ) shows a more significant excess at magnitudes fainter than the brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ; @xmath40 ; see also smail et al .",
    "the faster turnover of the central pos00 field at @xmath3 is the result of crowding , magnification bias ( fort et al . 1997 ; dye et al .",
    "2002 ) , and possibly cosmic variance ( see , e.g. , casertano et al .",
    "2000 ) .    as some fields overlap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : map ] ) , we have an opportunity to verify photometric consistency .",
    "no systematic differences were found and the scatter is less than 0.05 mags rms at @xmath41 increasing to @xmath42 mags at @xmath39 rms .",
    "as expected , this rms scatter is slightly larger than the random error ( 0.2 - 0.3 mags ) due to the additional systematic components in the detection algorithm and in the computation of the total magnitude ( mag_auto , see bertin & arnouts 1996 ) .",
    "a @xmath43 detection at @xmath39 is consistent with the observed turnover in the number counts .",
    "all hst images were registered to the astrometry of czoske et al .",
    "2001 ( hereafter the cfht astrometry ) , which has been determined to be accurate to @xmath44 from comparisons with the usno - a2.0 catalog .",
    "offsets between the original wfpc2 astrometry and the cfht astrometry are typically @xmath45 , and in the overlap regions we find an rms scatter of @xmath46 , consistent with the estimated uncertainty in the cfht astrometry .",
    "the photometric catalog comprises 22,000 objects to @xmath2825 .",
    "entries are described in tab  [ tab : entries ] and the head of the catalog is given in tab  [ tab : catalog ] in the central region , independent pointings partially overlap , and duplications have not been removed .",
    "all magnitudes are in the vega system and corrected for galactic extinction , adopting e(b - v)=0.057 ( schlegel et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "we now discuss the morphological classification of the objects in the catalog .",
    "broadly , the procedure followed that adopted for the hst _ medium deep survey _",
    "( abraham et al .",
    "1996a ) for which the minimum typical exposure time ( 4000s ) was similar and a limiting magnitude of @xmath31=22.0 was adopted .",
    "after some experimenting by one of the classifiers ( rse ) in that study , it was determined that a similar degree of reliability would be achieved in the cl0024 + 16 fields to a fainter limit @xmath31=22.5 .",
    "this value is intermediate with the fainter limit ( @xmath31=23 ) adopted in the 6300 - 16,800 sec morphs study ( smail et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "as noticed in previous studies , the uncertainty in the classification is a strong function of signal - to - noise ratio close to the limit and some distinctions are more critical then others , e.  g. distinguishing amongst regular galaxies is more reliable than disentangling late types from merger and irregulars .",
    "thus , after describing our classification procedure , we discuss in detail the uncertainty (   [ ssec : unmorph ] ) . a summary is given in  ",
    "[ ssec : summorph ] .",
    "morphological classification of all objects with magnitude ( mag_auto ) brighter than @xmath4 was performed by one of us ( rse ) using an iraf task which displayed , for each entry , a square region @xmath47 on a side , on a logarithmic intensity scale to simulate appearance on a photographic plate .",
    "each object was simultaneously displayed at four stretch levels to ensure an adequate dynamic range .",
    "morphologies ( hereafter t ) were assigned according to the mds scheme introduced by abraham et al .",
    "( 1996a ) : -2=star , -1=compact , 0=e , 1=e / s0 , 2=s0 , 3=sa+b , 4=s , 5=sc+d , 6=irr , 7=unclass , 8=merger , 9=fault . examples for classes -2 to 8 are shown in figures  [ fig : fig_morph1 ] , and  [ fig : fig_morph2 ] .",
    "it is important to clarify that the nomenclatures sa+b and sc+d represent the union of subclasses , not intermediate spiral types . as in the mds ,",
    "the system is hierarchical : classes such as e / s0 or s are used when the classifier recognizes the galaxy as an early or late type , but no further subclassification can be determined .",
    "the unclass ( 7 ) category comprises objects that are only partially imaged , e.g. they fall on the edge of a chip .",
    "finally , t=8 ( merger ) is used when the isophotes of two objects of comparable brightness merge ( c.f .",
    "examples in fig  [ fig : fig_morph2 ] ) .",
    "this could , of course , in some cases be due to projected alignments .",
    "the classifier s comments were also recorded together with the morphological type .",
    "a total of 2181 objects were processed in this way , including the ones in the central field classified by the morphs collaboration .",
    "the distribution of morphological types as a function of magnitude ( without regard to cluster membership ) is shown in figure  [ fig : tfrac ] .",
    "internal consistency in our classifications can be obtained by examining the overlapping fields , given our iraf task ensures a blind treatment of each image . at @xmath48 : 48 % of the galaxies have identical morphological type , 89 % differ by at most @xmath49 . at fainter magnitudes ( @xmath50 ) 56 % of the galaxies",
    "have identical t , while 74 % differ by at most @xmath49 .",
    "no clear magnitude dependence is seen .",
    "if we consider only  broad classes \" , defined as stars ( t=-2 ) , compacts ( -1 ) , early - types ( e+s0 , 0 to 2 ) , spirals ( 3 to 5 ) , and irr / unclass / merger ( 6 to 8) galaxies , the consistency improves significantly .",
    "75 - 80 % of galaxies have the same broad class and _ all _ lie within @xmath51 1 broad class .",
    "the agreement is consistent with earlier similar studies ( e.  g. smail et al .",
    "1997 ; fabricant et al.2000 ) .",
    "a further step was undertaken to ensure internal consistency .",
    "postage stamps @xmath47 on a side were sorted by morphological type and magnitude and carefully examined by two of us ( rse and tt ) . by comparing images of comparable",
    "signal - to - noise , the consistency and repeatability of the classification was re - examined .",
    "types were only changed in @xmath52% of the galaxies , mostly within broad classes ( e.g. sa+b to s ) .",
    "two of the well - known critical points in the morphological classification , are e+s0 vs spiral separation , and star galaxy separation ( see e.  g. smail et al .  1997 ; fabricant et al .",
    "the difficulty of separating e+s0 and spirals has been discussed widely in the literature . unfortunately  as opposed to the star galaxy separation where spectroscopic information provides an unambiguous verification  using external information to verify e+s0 vs spirals morphologies is much more difficult .",
    "although certain properties , such as spectral features and colors , are known to correlate with morphology there is significant scatter , and , as we are interested in the stellar population properties of galaxies , their use could lead to significant biases when applied to evolutionary studies .    distinguishing features ( spiral arms , bright young stars and star forming regions ) may be lost at intermediate redshift because of surface brightness dimming ( @xmath53 ) and resolution and/or sampling effects .",
    "figures  [ fig : fig_morph1 ] and  [ fig : fig_morph2 ] show that bright e+s0 and sa+b galaxies can be separated brighter than @xmath54 .",
    "our classifications are internally consistent to @xmath55 but suffer some ambiguity at @xmath56 . as an external check , the study by fabricant et al .",
    "( 2000 ) of cl1358 + 62 is particularly relevant since the hst observational setup ( instrument , filter , and exposure time ) and cluster redshift are closely similar to those for cl0024 + 16 .",
    "fabricant et al . found that human classifiers consistently distinguish early - types and spirals to @xmath55 , with increasing uncertainty beyond this limit .",
    "finer classification was found to be much more uncertain .",
    "for example the two classifier groups in fabricant et al.(2000 ) yielded discrepant values of the ratio of s0 and e galaxies already at @xmath48 .",
    "we conclude that early - type and spiral galaxies can be consistently distinguished with our instrumental setup down to at least @xmath55 .",
    "two further effects should be considered .",
    "firstly , if the distribution of morphological types is not uniform , any scatter might smear the distribution by transferring objects from the most populated class to adjacent classes ( see e.g. discussion in the appendix of fabricant et al .",
    "the second is due to the specific effects of distance , i.e. loss of resolution and surface brightness dimming .",
    "qualitatively , these effects tend to suppress low surface brightness features ( such as extended envelopes around s0 galaxies ) and smear out small - scale features ( such as compact star forming regions , or spiral arms ) .",
    "thus , the net qualitative effect is to transfer s0 galaxies to the e class and sa+b galaxies to the s0 or e class .",
    "unfortunately , the magnitude of these biases depend strongly on the properties of the parent populations and therefore can not be accurately corrected without additional assumptions .",
    "however , in our observing conditions , these effects are likely to be small especially at @xmath57 ( see , e.g. , discussion in glazebrook et al .  1995 ; abraham et al .",
    "1996a ; ellis et al .",
    "1997 ) .    securing a reliable distinction between stars , compact galaxies , and faint ellipticals",
    "is also an important concern . at bright magnitudes ( @xmath54 ) distinguishing between these types",
    "is straightforward ( figure  [ fig : fig_morph1 ] ) .",
    "fainter than @xmath58 , diffraction spikes can not be seen and peaked nuclear emission might be present in some galaxies .",
    "classification becomes troublesome for objects smaller than the wfpc2 f814w psf whose fwhm@xmath59 ( casertano et al .",
    "2000 ) , corresponding to approximately @xmath60 kpc at the cluster redshift .",
    "fortunately , most normal elliptical members at @xmath13 within our magnitude limit should have effective radii significantly larger than 0.5 kpc ( ziegler et al .",
    "1999 and references therein ) , and therefore should be clearly resolved .",
    "our spectroscopic catalog ( see @xmath16  [ sec : z ] ) provides a valuable external check on the star compact elliptical boundary : out of 13 objects classified as stars with available spectroscopic data , 11 are confirmed and 2 have @xmath61 flagged with  uncertain \" quality .",
    "out of 8 objects with spectra classified as compacts ( i.e. deduced morphologically to be non - stellar ) , 5 are stars and 3 are galaxies with @xmath62 .",
    "although the samples are small , the spectroscopic data suggests we have erred on the side of trying not to omit any extragalactic sources .",
    "this augurs well and suggests no ellipticals have been misclassified as stars .",
    "indeed , all of the objects with zero spectroscopic redshift were independently morphologically classified as stars or compacts .",
    "a second external check is facilitated by considering the photometric distribution of objects in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "for this purpose we augmented the hst photometry with wide field v and i band images obtained with canada france hawaii ( cfht ) 12k camera .",
    "the e+s0 members define a tight color - magnitude sequence ( see natarajan et al .",
    "stars span a wider range , generally bluer then the e+s0 red - sequence , and are found at significantly brighter magnitudes .",
    "compacts are numerous only at @xmath63 , and also span a wide range of colors although are generally redder than the e+s0 red sequence , indicating that some are likely to be background galaxies .",
    "a final check is provided by the sextractor parameter class_star ( see bertin & arnouts 1996 for details ) , which should be close to unity for genuine stellar objects and around 0 for extended objects . confirming the results of our discussion , non - saturated stars have class_star parameters greater than 0.9 , while e galaxies have typically class_star close to zero , except for a small fraction at magnitudes fainter than @xmath55 that have class_star larger than 0.8 .",
    "compacts have class_star parameters between 0.8 and 1 . in summary therefore , external diagnostic information based on spectroscopy and colors support the notion that there is little or no confusion so far as our morphological selection of cluster spheroidals , and virtually all of the compacts are either stars or distant background galaxies .",
    "we have morphologically classified 2181 objects in the sextractor catalog to a magnitude limit of @xmath41 , using the morphological classes illustrated in figures  [ fig : fig_morph1 ] and  [ fig : fig_morph2 ] .",
    "the resulting distribution of types as a function of magnitude is shown in figure  [ fig : tfrac ] .",
    "the accuracy of the classification  measured in terms of repeatability  is found to be excellent down to @xmath55 , and still very good in broader classes ( star ; compact ; e+s0 ; sp ; irr / merger ) to the limit @xmath4 , in agreement with the precision attained independently in similar datasets ( fabricant et al .",
    "two critical points such as star / galaxy separation and s0 vs sa separation are investigated with the aid of external information .",
    "we find that all of the spectroscopically confirmed stars are classified either as star or as compact , a class that is used mostly at magnitude fainter than @xmath58 , and is most likely a mix of stars , and high redshift compact objects .",
    "similarly we conclude that the quality of the data is sufficient to separate reliably early - type and late - type galaxies down to at least @xmath55 .",
    "the subsequent analysis based on morphological types will note the distinction in quality beyond @xmath6421 and often be restricted to this limit where the classifications are particularly reliable .",
    "following the comprehensive spectroscopic survey of czoske et al ( 2001 ) , a sufficiently large sample of spectroscopically confirmed members is already available to support the present investigation of the distribution of morphological types with radius and local density .",
    "a spectroscopic survey of cl0024 + 16 is continuing at the 10 m keck telescopes with two goals : _",
    "i ) _ to obtain high - quality and where possible resolved 2-d spectra in order to explore dynamical and star formation characteristics for members of known morphology ; _ ii ) _ to extend the redshift survey beyond the limit of @xmath55 of previous surveys ( dressler et al .  1999 ; czoske et al .",
    "2001 ) and gain a more complete sampling that is better matched to the dilute pattern of wfpc2 images .",

    "the new keck spectra discussed here were obtained using the low resolution imager spectrograph ( lris ; oke et al .",
    "1995 ) . in order to cover a suitable range of local density we decided to survey a strip oriented approximately north - south through the cluster center .",
    "the orientation was chosen to maximize overlap with wfpc2 fields with known cluster members .",

    "( 2002 ) , the distribution around @xmath9 is characterized by a main peak ( a in fig .",

    "see czoske et al.(2002 ) . here",
    "we only remind that the relative velocity between the two peaks is @xmath74 km  @xmath70 in the rest frame of the cluster , and that the formal velocity dispersions of the two peaks are approximately 600 km  @xmath70 . adopting the velocity limits for the peaks as defined by czoske et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , there are 304 galaxies in peak a ( @xmath75 ) and 54 in peak b ( @xmath76 ) . matching the above catalog with the wfpc2 catalog yields what we will term the wfpc2@xmath77 catalog containing 362 objects , including 15 stars . of the galaxies with wfpc2 morphologies , 179 have redshifts within peak a but only 16 lie within peak b ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histoz ] ) . in the following",
    "we will use the term cluster members to refer to galaxies in either one of the two peaks ( the results are unchanged if only peak a is considered ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : spacedistab ] shows the projected distribution of members in peaks a and b. as noticed by czoske et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , those in peak b are fairly homogeneously distributed . by contrast",
    ", there is a marked clump of those in peak a to the nw of the cluster center .",
    "because the fraction of area covered by our wfpc2 survey decreases with radius and the a peak is more concentrated than the b peak  the ratio of galaxies in peak b to galaxies in peak a is smaller in the wfpc2-z sample than in the full spectroscopic sample .      as the redshift catalog involves heterogeneous datasets , it is important to check redshift completeness in apparent magnitude , cluster radius and overall spatial extent .",
    "first we examine completeness defined as the ratio of galaxies in the wfpc2-z catalog ( n@xmath78 ) to those in the @xmath7922.5 limited wfpc2 catalog , as a function of magnitude and cluster radius .",
    "the magnitude dependence is shown in the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp ] .",

    "the upper panel of the same figure shows the actual numbers per magnitude bin .",
    "completeness does not depend significantly on the morphological type , as demonstrated in the lower panel of fig.[fig : comp ] . accordingly , in the following analysis we assume that the wfpc2-z catalog is representative of the entire population without introducing significant bias in the mix of morphological types .",
    "second , in figure  [ fig : comp3 ] we show the redshift completeness as function of cluster radius . at @xmath48",
    "the completeness drops sharply from almost 80 % at the center to below 20  % beyond @xmath80 ( @xmath7 3 mpc ) . at fainter magnitudes",
    "the completeness is significantly smaller , dropping below 20  % already at @xmath81 .",
    "completeness as a function of radius segregated by broad morphological type is shown in the middle and lower panels of figure  [ fig : comp3 ] .",
    "importantly , no major difference is found at either faint or bright magnitude limits , confirming that the wfpc2-z catalog appears to be representative of the morphological mix at any given radius .    in summary ,",
    "the wfpc2-z catalog is sufficiently complete at @xmath48 , particularly in the central mpc where it is above 60% .",
    "it declines to 20 % at 5 mpc .",
    "the completeness is much lower for galaxies fainter than @xmath82 ; it is @xmath7 30 % for @xmath41 in the central mpc .",
    "such incompleteness is inevitable even after considerable efforts .",
    "fortunately , however , the catalog is not obviously biased in favor of any particular morphological type .",
    "we will argue in the next sections that , by restricting the analyses to @xmath55 , uncertainties arising from both incompleteness and morphological typing ( see @xmath16 [ ssec : unmorph ] ) are minimal .",
    "we will assume that the distribution of morphological types in the wfpc2-z sample is representative .",
    "it is recognized that at large radii ( 4 - 5 mpc )  where spectroscopic information is most needed to establish membership ",
    "the wfpc2-z sample is only @xmath83  % of the parent sample , so significant extrapolation is necessary .",
    "accordingly , results based on the wfpc2-z catalog in this region must be interpreted with greater caution .",
    "before interpreting the observations , it is convenient to build a physical framework for our study by defining the relevant time , velocity , and length scales associated with some of the various processes that have been proposed for the environmental evolution of cluster galaxies .",
    "we introduce these processes in section  [ ssec : zoo ] .",
    "since there exists a considerable literature on this subject with creative terminology often used with various meanings , we also use this opportunity to define our own terminology .",
    "ideally we are interested in reconstructing the evolution of a single , hypothetical representative galaxy as it enters the cluster potential and interacts with the intercluster medium . to this aim , we present estimates of the sphere of influence of each relevant physical process affecting the infalling galaxy .    using a simple cluster model and estimates of relevant length , time and velocity scales discussed in the appendices , in section  [ ssec:2d ] we discuss projection effects and use the various scales to define various observable regions of the cluster for each of the physical mechanisms listed in section  [ ssec : zoo ] .",
    "the key output is a series of distinguishing zones which will form the basis of the later analysis .      for simplicity",
    ", we define the various processes under three broad headings : galaxy - icm interactions ( which refers to the interaction of a cluster galaxy with the gaseous component of the cluster ) , galaxy - cluster gravitational interaction ( which includes tidal and related dynamical processes ) , and smaller - scale galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "clearly the distinction is , in places , somewhat arbitrary .    1 .",
    "galaxy - icm interactions .",
    "a ) ram pressure stripping , the removal of galactic gas by pressure exerted by the intercluster medium ( gunn & gott 1972 ; fuijta 1998 ; fujita & nagashima 1999 ; abadi et al.1999 ; toniazzo & schindler 2001 ; fujita 2001 ) , serves to terminate star formation by removing the gas supply .",
    "b ) thermal evaporation of the galactic interstellar medium ( ism ) by the hot icm ( cowie & songaila 1977 ) .",
    "c ) turbulent and viscous stripping of the ism ( nulsen 1982 ; toniazzo & schindler 2001 ) .",
    "d ) pressure - triggered star formation in which galactic gas clouds are compressed by the icm pressure thereby temporarily increasing the star formation rate ( dressler & gunn 1983 ; evrard 1991 ; fujita 1998 ) .",
    "2 .   galaxy - cluster gravitational interactions .",
    "a ) tidal compression of galactic gas ( byrd & valtonen 1990 ; henriksen & byrd 1996 ; fujita 1998 ) by interaction with the cluster potential can increase the star formation rate ; b ) tidal truncation of the outer galactic regions ( e.g. the dark matter halos ) by the cluster potential ( merritt 1983 , 1984 ; ghigna et al .",
    "1998 ; natarajan et al .",
    "if tidal interactions remove the gas reservoir they can also lead to quenching of star formation but , more generally , such processes can be inferred via structural changes in the galactic mass profiles .",
    "galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "a ) mergers , i.e. low speed interactions between galaxies of similar mass ( icke 1985 ; mihos 1995 ; bekki 1998 ) .",
    "b ) harassment , i.e. high speed interactions between galaxies in the potential of the cluster ( moore et al .",
    "1996 ; moore , lake & katz 1998 ; moore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "depending on the fraction of gas removed and its rate , ram - pressure stripping , thermal evaporation , turbulent and viscous stripping can lead either to a rapid quenching of star formation or a slow decrease in the star formation rate if only the loosely bound reservoir surrounding field galaxies is affected ( larson , tinsley & caldwell 1980 , balogh , navarro & morris 2000 ; diaferio et al .",
    "2001 ; drake et al .",
    "independent of the precise physical process , we will label this slow decrease in the star formation rate _",
    "starvation_.    the above mechanisms can affect the observed internal structure of cluster galaxies , including the mass distribution as probed by galaxy - galaxy lensing , internal kinematics as probed by resolved spectroscopy , and/or the star formation properties as probed with diagnostic spectroscopic and photometric features .",
    "crucially , changes in internal structure and star formation properties can affect morphologies . in disentangling the various effects , we must attempt to rank  at least approximately  the importance of each mechanism for various physical regions of the cluster .",
    "the dominant physical mechanisms together with the estimate of their spheres of influence  as derived in appendix  [ app : ls ]  are summarized in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : mechanisms ] .      in order to explain the run of observables with radius in terms of the various physical mechanisms discussed",
    ", we use the spheres of influence shown in figure  [ fig : mechanisms ] and the physical scales estimated in the appendices , to determine how our instantaneous view of the observed position of the cluster galaxies may be linked to the physical and temporal scales of influence of each mechanism taking into account the effects of projection .",
    "although galaxies can move significantly during transient phenomena of @xmath84 gyr duration , the goal is to identify projected regions where we can _ exclude _ the possibility that certain mechanisms are at work .",
    "we define three annular projected regions : the cluster center , a transition region and the cluster periphery ( shown in figure  [ fig : mechanisms ] , lower panel ) within which we will search for correspondence in the observed properties of the galaxy population .    1 .",
    "the central region comprises that within a @xmath84 mpc radius .",
    "it is the region where the cluster potential is steepest and the icm is detectable .",
    "most of the mechanisms are effectively at work ( see figure  [ fig : mechanisms ] , lower panel ) , speeds can be high ( up to a few thousands of km  @xmath70 ) , and projection effects can pollute this central region with galaxies that are at the periphery of the cluster .",
    "hence unfortunately none of the mechanisms can be definitely excluded , although we can expect the mechanisms mostly related to the cluster potential ( tidal stripping and tidal triggering ) to be dominant .",
    "this is also the region mostly probed by previous hst surveys . 2 .",
    "the transition region - an annulus between @xmath84 and @xmath85 mpc comprising the virial radius  is sufficiently far from the center that galaxies observed in this region can not have experienced tidal effects more recently than 0.5 - 1 gyr ago and can not be experiencing ram - pressure stripping ( although they can have in the recent past ) .",
    "the periphery is the annulus between @xmath86 mpc and the outermost radius probed ( @xmath7 5 mpc ) .",
    "it is so far from the center ( and speeds are lower than in the rest of the cluster ) so that , given the discussion in appendix  [ app : tvs ] , we can safely assume that most of the galaxies at the periphery of the cluster _ have never been through the cluster center _ and therefore have never experienced the effects of tidal stripping , tidal triggering of star formation and ram - pressure stripping .",
    "nevertheless , they may be experiencing starvation and are able to undergo mergers or be harassed by massive nearby galaxies .",
    "we now combine the morphological and the redshift catalogs to study the distribution of morphological types in cl0024 + 16 both as a function of radius ( hereafter the t - r relation ; section  [ ssec : tr ] ) and as a function of the local projected density ( hereafter the t-@xmath5 relation ; section  [ ssec : ts ] )    in the local universe , the t@xmath87 and t - r relations have been actively studied over the past three decades ( oemler 1974 ; melnick & sargent 1977 ; dressler 1980 ; postman & geller 1984 ; giovanelli et al .",
    "1986 ; whitmore & gilmore 1991 ; oemler 1992 ; whitmore , gilmore & jones 1993 ) , often in terms of the quest for the most fundamental relation .",
    "indeed , there is a strong scientific motivation for determining and comparing these relations over a wide range of environmental density in order to determine which physical processes fundamentally governs the morphological evolution of galaxies .",
    "for example , the t - r relation should provide a tool to investigate the effects of those phenomena which are related to the cluster s gravitational potential including interaction with the hot intercluster medium : such phenomena should run broadly as a function of azimuthally - smoothed radius . on the other hand ,",
    "the effects of local overdensities and subclustering in the resident or newcomer population , will be erased in the t - r analysis . in this case , it is useful to examine the t-@xmath5 relation .",
    "dressler ( 1980 ) introduced the t-@xmath5 relation as a means to investigate the environmental effects on galaxy evolution in non symmetric ( `` non - relaxed '' ) clusters , where the definition of a cluster center was difficult and ambiguous . remarkably , dressler ( 1980 ) found that the t-@xmath5 relation in the local universe was identical for `` relaxed '' and `` non - relaxed '' clusters ( see also dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) , and used this result to argue against ram - pressure stripping as a dominant mechanism to transform spirals into e+s0 .",

    "( 1993 ) reanalyzed the data in the dressler s sample applying several corrections to the background estimate , magnitude limit , and center estimate .",
    "they claimed that morphology correlates better with radius than with local density and since a sharp decrease in the fraction of e+s0 with radius is seen only in the innermost regions ( @xmath11 mpc ) they argued that tidal disruption of spirals and s0 by the cluster potential is the dominant mechanism .",
    "further insight can be gained by studying the t - r and t-@xmath5 relation at intermediate redshift @xmath88 , where the galaxy population is undergoing profound transformations .",
    "dressler et al.(1997 ) studied the t-@xmath5 and t - r relations in the core ( typically within the inner 0.5 mpc ) of a sample of clusters at @xmath89 including cl0024 + 16 .",
    "for the high concentration clusters  such as cl0024 + 16  they found the fraction of early - type galaxies was a steeply increasing ( decreasing ) function of local density ( radius ) .",
    "by contrast , the low concentration clusters did not show any gradient in the fraction of early - type galaxies with respect to local density or radius .",
    "consequently they inferred that low concentration clusters are less evolved then high concentration ones and segregation of morphological types has not happened yet .",
    "unfortunately , their data did not cover the periphery of clusters , which we argue ( section  [ sec : mechanisms ] ) is helpful in understanding the mechanisms driving the change of the morphological mix between @xmath88 and today ( dressler et al .",

    "; dressler et al .",

    "we wish to extend the t-@xmath5 and t - r relations to larger radii ( 5 mpc ) and lower projected densities . as a laboratory for investigating this issue , cl0024 + 16",
    "is an interesting case because the two descriptions are not completely equivalent .",
    "both the redshift distribution ( figure  [ fig : histoz ] ) and the projected distribution ( figure  [ fig : spacedistab ] ) indicate the cluster is not perfectly regular or relaxed ( czoske et al .",

    "although an average trend is seen , there is considerable scatter ( section  [ ssec : ts ] ) .",
    "accordingly , contrasting galaxy properties in the context of both variables will be illuminating .      in order to derive the t-@xmath5 and t - r relations we must remove background / foreground contamination ,",

    "1998 ) , to illustrate this uncertainty .",
    "the uncertainty is clearly relevant at large radii .",
    "additionally , field galaxies are clustered on the angular scale of a wf chip ( see also valotto , moore & lambas 2001 ) thus field to field variation dominates the uncertainty in the background contamination .    to estimate the average background count per morphological type , we adopt the postman et al .",
    "( 1998 ) number counts , scaled by the fraction of morphological types found by abraham et al .",

    "what is the run with radius of the density of e+s0 and s+i galaxies ?",
    "how does the cluster population of cl0024 + 16 compare to the surrounding field ?",
    "the lower panel of figure  [ fig : defrad ] shows the fraction of spectroscopic members ( defined as that fraction of all with redshifts lying within @xmath102 ) as a function of radius .",
    "error bars were obtained assuming the binomial distribution ( gehrels 1986 ) . clearly , there is an excess of galaxies to the largest radius ( @xmath305 mpc ) . using the canada france redshift survey spectroscopic catalog ( lilly et al .",
    "1995 ) limited at @xmath101 , only a few percent of field galaxies is expected to lie within this narrow redshift range . in the two upper panels we show the e+s0 and s+i surface density as a function of radius , computed by removing the background as discussed above ( sec  [ ssec : backfore ] ) .",
    "error bars are computed assuming poisson statistics ( gehrels 1986 ) not corrected for field galaxy clustering . at large radii ( the periphery )",
    "no statistically - significant excess of either type is found .",
    "this is due in part to the large additional uncertainties involved in the type - dependent subtraction .",
    "a small systematic over - subtraction of the background can not be excluded , considering the cluster is optically - selected and the presence of a local background underdensity would have enhanced its discovery ( dressler 1984 ) . the type - dependent excess is detectable out to a radius of @xmath103 mpc and becomes very significant only within the inner 1 mpc . as far as the mix of morphological types is concerned , the densities of e+s0 and s+i galaxies remain quite similar down to the central regions and only within the central 200 kpc does the e+s0 component become the dominant component .",
    "figure  [ fig : defrad ] shows the importance of using spectroscopically confirmed members for the periphery . in the inner mpc",
    "however , the error introduced by our statistical background / foreground correction is acceptable and both the wfpc2 and the wfpc2-z catalogs can be used .",
    "the result of enlarging the inner sample to include the wfpc2 catalog is shown in figure  [ fig : earlyfrac ] for both e+s0 ( upper panel ) and s+i ( lower panel ) galaxies .",
    "fractions determined from the wfpc2-z sample are plotted as solid symbols , with errors determined assuming a binomial distribution .",
    "the fractions could be biased if the incompleteness depends on morphological types , which seems not to be the case ( sec  [ ssec : speccomp ] ) . however , the numbers involved are small ( @xmath7 50 galaxies per radial bin ) and the errors accordingly large .",
    "fractions determined from the wfpc2 sample ( open points ) suffer less from small number statistics , therefore are probably to be preferred in the innermost regions ( @xmath104 mpc ) when the uncertainty due to background / foreground contamination removal is sufficiently small .",
    "the inner mpc shows a steep gradient in morphological mix .",
    "e+s0 galaxies dominate and reach @xmath105% of the population in the inner 200 kpc ( lower than in local clusters where they reach almost 100% , e.  g. whitmore , gilmore & jones 1993 ) .",
    "beyond 1 mpc the fraction of e+s0 remains constant within the error , or at most mildly declining ( from @xmath106% to @xmath107% ) .",
    "a more significant difference is seen between the morphological mix at 1 mpc ( @xmath106% ) and the field ( @xmath108% ) .",
    "the field fraction was determined by combining the subsample of the cfrs - ldss with hst images ( brinchmann et al .",

    "these field samples are the most appropriate given that they were consistently classified by the same classifier ( rse ) , and are either spectroscopically complete ( cfrs - ldss ) or at least suffer from similar incompleteness as the cluster samples ( cl0024 + 16 and the morphs ) .",
    "however , the mix in the field sample is affected by small number statistics%,@xmath112% , assuming binomial distribution . ] and cosmic variance .",
    "surprisingly , no larger spectroscopically complete sample of field galaxies with hst imaging is yet available to improve this comparison .",
    "the accuracy of the cluster fractions will improve when more redshifts in the periphery will be available , allowing us to improve the determination of the slope of the early - type fraction from the transition region to the periphery to the field .",
    "as a first step in understanding the radial run of the e+s0 fraction , we seek to identify which physical mechanism(s ) among the ones described in section  [ sec : mechanisms ] can ( or can not ) be responsible for the transformation of the infalling galaxies . to investigate this , we will consider the three diagnostic regions defined in section 4 ( figure  [ fig : mechanisms ] and figure  [ fig : defrad ] ) : the center , transition , and periphery .    in the transition region ,",
    "isolated infalling galaxies can not have experienced tidal effects or ram pressure stripping more recently than 0.5 - 1 gyr ago . in the periphery",
    "most of the galaxies _ have never been through the center _ and therefore are free from the effects of tidal stripping , tidal triggering of star formation and ram - pressure stripping . the mild decline in star formation associated with the gentle demise of spirals between the field and the transition region ( figure  [ fig : earlyfrac ] )",
    "can not be ascribed to tidal interactions with the cluster potential nor to ram pressure stripping or triggering of star formation none of which are effective here . setting aside merging",
    " which we will discuss later  this leaves us starvation and harassment .",
    "ultimately , a direct observation that the infalling population has smaller gas reservoirs than in the field would be needed to discriminate these .",
    "accurate star formation diagnostics at large radii would provide some constraints . if significant numbers of starbursting / post - starburst galaxies ( see dressler et al .  1999 ; poggianti et al .",
    "1999 ) are found at the periphery , quenching would have to occur after a burst had depleted the gas , in contrast with the starvation picture ( balogh , navarro , morris 2001 ; diaferio et al.2001 ) .",
    "harassment should be detectable through an increased fraction of disturbed / interacting galaxies with respect to the field ( oemler et al .",
    "unfortunately , it is not obvious how to unambiguously recognize the effects especially for high surface brightness milky - way type spirals where the signatures could be subtle ( moore et al.1999 ) .",
    "whichever mechanisms are involved , the timescales for the gradual morphological transformation between the field and the transition region are rather slow ( see section  [ sec : mechanisms ] and appendix  [ app : tvs ] ) .",
    "are the same phenomena , appropriately accelerated and intensified , responsible also for the steep trend in the inner mpc ? or are additional mechanisms at work",
    "? a quenching mechanism could produce gentle morphological changes over a few gyr and the mild gradients observed beyond 1 mpc radius .",
    "an additional mechanism , more appropriate to the cluster center , would induce rapid and dramatic changes via bursts of star formation and/or major structural changes .",
    "multiple mechanisms / timescales have been discussed by poggianti et al.(1999 ) and dressler et al .",
    "( 1999 ) who claim that the star formation properties of infalling galaxies react rapidly to environmental influences becoming visible as soon as they sense the cluster potential .",
    "by contrast , more time is needed for significant morphological transformations .",
    "a completely different possibility discussed in the next section involves a segregation effect .",
    "objects at different radii represent ones with different early assembly ( merger ) histories which are insufficiently mixed in the cluster to erase correlations between their history and their current location ( diaferio et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "we now examine the @xmath113 relation to further investigate the infalling scenario and the effects of segregation . following dressler ( 1980 ) , we estimate the local projected density associated with each galaxy by computing the area of the rectangle with sides parallel to the cardinal axis that encloses the galaxy and its ten nearest neighbors , using this area to compute the local density , and finally by removing the background contamination ( as described above in section  [ ssec : backfore ] ) . we only consider those galaxies associated with a positive density .",
    "the resulting t-@xmath5 relation ( figure  [ fig : tscfrm ] ) shows that the fraction of early - type galaxies increases monotonically with local surface density . for comparison",
    ", we overplot the fraction of e+s0 as a function of projected density for the central region of cl0024 + 16 as determined by the morphs collaboration ( smail et al .  1997 ;",

    "1997 ) , as appropriate for our assumed cosmology and magnitude limit .",
    "our data extends the measurement by well over an order of magnitude in projected density @xmath5 . in the region of overlap",
    "there is a good agreement between the two measurements .",
    "the slope in the fraction of e+s0 galaxies appears to flatten just below the limit probed by the morphs , declining gently from @xmath114% towards the field value of @xmath115 ( obtained as described in ",
    "[ ssec : tr ] ) .",
    "this behavior is very similar to that observed locally , where the t-@xmath5 relation extends over several orders of magnitude in density from clusters continuously to the field ( postman & geller 1984 ; see also bhavsar 1981 , de souza et al.1982 , giovanelli et al .",
    "1986 ) .",
    "the existence of the t-@xmath5 relation at low densities was not _ a priori _ implied by the existence of the @xmath116 relation , even for an approximately regular cluster such as cl0024 + 16 .",
    "figure  [ fig : svsr ] shows that local density is not a well defined function of radius , except in the central @xmath11 mpc .",
    "spikes in projected density  such as that at @xmath7 1 mpc  arise as a result of substructures ( a similar phenomenon is seen also locally , see e.g. andreon 1996 ) .",
    "the scatter is significantly larger than expected from measurement errors . using the definition of @xmath5 ( dressler 1980 )",
    ", the measurement scatter can be estimated assuming a poisson distribution for the cluster members and the field to field variation of the background , corrected using the two - point correlation function as measured by postman et al .",
    "the expected error as a function of @xmath5 is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : svsr ] , while the points with error bars represent the average @xmath5 in radial annuli , with the scatter expected from measurement uncertainties .",
    "how is the scatter in the local density at a given radius consistent with the derived t-@xmath5 relation ? at face value the existence of a relation implies galaxies are more aware of their local overdensity than cluster location .",
    "we investigated this further by dividing our sample in two subsets : one from the central pos00 field ( i.e the inner 0.5 mpc , where the @xmath117 relation is monotonic ) and one from the overdensity @xmath98 mpc nw of the center corresponding to the spike in local density in figure  [ fig : svsr ] ( pos36 , see map in figure  [ fig : map ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : tsr ] shows the results of this exercise .",
    "the fraction of early - type galaxies still correlates with the local density in the two subsets , i.  e. galaxies at large radii clearly  know \" if they are in a local overdensity . in the overlapping density region , the fractions of morphological types are mutually consistent .",
    "these conclusions are particularly significant when one considers that the cluster galaxies within @xmath84 mpc are moving at speeds of @xmath84 mpc gyr@xmath18 . at the typical densities of @xmath118 gal mpc@xmath36 where differences in the morphological mix become significant ,",
    "the smoothing box inherent to our measurement is of order @xmath119 mpc@xmath120 .",
    "hence galaxies with uncorrelated velocity vectors would erase the t-@xmath5 relation in much less than a gyr , unless we assume that morphology is a transient phenomenon with implausibly short duration .",
    "not only are galaxy properties arranged according to their local environment but apparently in undertaking their motion within the cluster potential they _ move with it _",
    "( i.e. they retain their identity in these groups as infall continues ) .",
    "this is a clear indication that  at least outside the central region  the cluster is more logically viewed as a collection of larger self - contained poorly - mixed clumps ( dressler & shectman 1988 , zabludoff & franx 1993 ) .",
    "the presence of substructure is confirmed at high significance by the dressler & shectman ( 1988 ) test : even considering galaxies in peak a alone the probability of positions and radial velocities being uncorrelated is less than @xmath121 ( @xmath122 combining peaks a and b ) . another way to view this result is that , within the error bars , outside the cluster center , the mix of morphological types at given surface density is irrespective of that clump s location within the cluster ( see figure  [ fig : tsr ] ) .",
    "although radial trends in morphology were discussed in section 6.2 in the context of infall timescales , we have argued on the basis of figures 14 - 16 , that outside 1 mpc , the local projected density plays the main role .",
    "we interpret this as evidence that cl0024 + 16 is accreting galaxies in organized substructures , each of which obeys some form of t-@xmath5 relation .",
    "an interesting explanation of our observations would be that the correlation between local density and morphology arises as a result of pre - cluster conditions , possibly because galaxies located at different local densities suffered different assembly and star formation histories .",
    "both radial and density effects are important but influence different regimes . beyond @xmath123 mpc , we are witnessing trends that relate to the previous assembly histories of infalling groups .",
    "starvation may play some role in changing the fate of galaxies in these clumps , but whatever process is at work , it operates slowly and is insufficient to supplant that based on segregation which is not erased by mixing .",
    "inwards of @xmath124 mpc , the tight correlation between radius and density ( figure  [ fig : svsr ] ) presumably follows the disruption of this substructure . at this level ,",
    "the correlation with the initial local environment is probably lost , while retaining the morphological segregation as a function of radius .",
    "the cluster radius then becomes the fundamental variable .",
    "phenomena more closely related to the cluster potential  such as tidal interaction or ram pressure stripping  may play an additional role in morphological transformations .",
    "the @xmath113 trend found outside the central region strengthens our earlier conclusion ( section  [ sssec : trdisc ] ) that ram - pressure stripping , ram - pressure triggering of star formation , tidal truncation and tidal - triggering of star formation by the main cluster potential are not dominant . further a t-@xmath5 relation is also found locally in non - concentrated systems , where presumably the effects of the overall cluster potential and the icm are negligible ; dressler 1980 ) .",
    "finally , figure  [ fig : tscfr0 ] compares our t-@xmath5 relation for cl0024 + 16 with that determined locally ( dressler 1980 , revised in dressler et al .",
    "1997 ) . at projected densities",
    "higher than @xmath125 gal mpc@xmath36 , the fraction of early - type galaxies is higher in the local universe than in cl0024 + 16 at any given @xmath5 .",
    "this agrees with other intermediate redshift studies which indicate that the fraction of e+s0 declines with redshift ( e.  g. van dokkum et al .",
    "an equally interesting result ( unique to the cl0024 + 16 dataset ) is that at local densities below @xmath125 gal mpc@xmath36 the morphological mix at @xmath126 is indistinguishable ( within the errors ) to that observed locally .",
    "a related result is seen in the t - r relation at the periphery ( c.f .",
    "figure  [ fig : earlyfrac ] with figure 12 in dressler et al .",
    "the field number densities are insufficiently precise to establish whether this is a displacement of e+s0 galaxies from the field to the highest density regions , a transformation of spirals into e+s0s , or a combination .",
    "regardless , it is clear that the morphological mix of galaxies in low density environments has not changed significantly since @xmath9 ( @xmath127 % of the hubble time ) . in combination with the ( at most ) mild gradients of morphological fraction at large radii discussed in section  [ sssec : trdisc ] , and with the mild decline in star formation rate in the outer parts of clusters ,",
    "we interpret this as further evidence that slow environmental processes are at work in the outer parts of clusters .",
    "in this paper we have presented the first results from a wide field hst survey of the rich galaxy cluster cl0024 + 16 at @xmath0 .",
    "we exploit an unique wide - field mosaic of hst wfpc2 images and relate these to available spectroscopic data in order to examine the morphological mix as a function of radius and projected galaxian density .",
    "our main observational results can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "we have obtained wfpc2 observations ( 39 independent pointings ) covering an approximately circular region of 10 mpc in diameter around the center of cl0024 + 16 .",
    "the areal sampling ranges from 100 % at the center to @xmath720 - 40 % at the periphery .",
    "we produce an object catalog comprising over 22,000 object to @xmath39 ( f814w ) .",
    "all @xmath128 objects to @xmath4 have been morphologically classified in a scheme broadly similar to that adopted for the medium deep survey .",
    "approximately 100 new redshifts in the field have been obtained using the w.  m. keck i telescope . together with other redshift catalogs ( dressler et al .",
    "1999 ; czoske et al .",
    "2001 ; owen 2001 ; metevier & koo 2001 ) this brings the total number of objects with redshift to 787 ( including 358 members ; @xmath102 ) . after cross correlation with the morphological wfpc2 catalog we created the redshift wfpc2-z catalog , consisting of 362 objects with both redshift and wfpc2 imaging ( 195 cluster members ) .",
    "3 .   using a simple model for the cluster based on the observed mass estimate and x - ray surface brightness profile ( appendix a ) , we have estimated the time and velocity scales for galaxy infall and the regions of influence of various mechanisms proposed to account for environment evolution .",
    "we define three projected regions ; the cluster center ( @xmath129 mpc ) where tidal effects of the cluster potential and those of the icm are dominant ; the transition region ( @xmath71 - 2.4 mpc , comprising the virial radius ) where galaxies do not experience the strong interaction with the cluster potential and the icm , but some fraction of galaxies may have experienced interaction with the cluster center in the recent past ( @xmath130 gyr ) , and the periphery beyond 2.4 mpc where galaxies are entering the cluster for the first time and where environmental trends are driven by slow ( @xmath131 gyr ) phenomena .",
    "we have used the morphological catalog ( wfpc2 ) and the redshift catalog ( wfpc2-z ) to study the galaxy population and the mix of morphological types with cluster radius ( the so - called @xmath116 relation ) to the previously unexplored regions beyond 1 mpc at @xmath15=0.4 .",
    "cluster galaxies ( @xmath102 ) are found out to 5 mpc from the cluster center , but the marginal excess with respect to the background makes precise studies difficult until further spectroscopy is available .",

    "the mild gradients found at large radii in the morphological mix can not be explained by mechanisms such as tidal triggering of star formation and tidal stripping of the dark matter halos by the main cluster potential , nor by ram pressure triggering of star formation , or ram pressure stripping , which are ineffective in these regions .",
    "instead we suggest that other mechanisms such as starvation or harassment operate over timescales of several gyrs .",

    ", we can directly compute the ram pressure @xmath172 and check where ram pressure stripping is effective using the condition ( gunn & gott 1972 ; see also abadi , moore & bower 1999 , fujita & nagashima 1999 ; fujita 2001 ; toniazzo & schindler 2001 ) @xmath173 where the rotational velocity of the infalling galaxy @xmath174 , its scale length ( @xmath175 ) , and surface density of hi ( @xmath176 ) , are expressed in units appropriate for the milky - way ( spitzer 1978 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ) . for an infalling milky - way the stripping radius occurs in the range @xmath177 mpc , therefore we will assume @xmath178mpc .",
    "a similar estimate is obtaining by considering that  given central velocity dispersion of the cluster galaxies @xmath179 km  @xmath70 ( soucail et al .",
    "2001 )  galaxies in the center of the cluster will have maximal velocity with respect to the x - ray emitting gas of order @xmath180 km  @xmath70 . using the gas density given in equation  [ eq : beta ] and the condition in equation  [ eq : ram ] , we obtain a stripping radius @xmath181 mpc . note that we are considering here the most favorable conditions for ram pressure stripping ( i.e. maximal velocity ) so that @xmath182 is practically the maximal radius at which we expect to ram - pressure stripping to be effective . in summary",
    ", we estimate that for cl0024 + 16 @xmath183 mpc at most .",
    "alternate mechanisms ( thermal evaporation , viscous and turbulent stripping ) might be more effective in this respect , depending on the detailed physics and the galactic orbits . for simplicity",
    ", we will assume that alternate mechanisms occur at most with the same intensity and therefore do not affect our estimate of the region where stripping is important .    the extended gas reservoir that may surround field galaxies ( see benson et al .",
    "2000 ) , sustains star formation in low density environments and is more loosely bound .",
    "accordingly it can be removed at radii beyond @xmath182 .",
    "this effect is dependent on the detailed physics , the galaxy orientation and the structure of the diffuse reservoir .",
    "we will assume that such starvation can be also effective at least to the virial radius ( e.  g. abadi et al .",
    "1999 ; balogh et al .",
    ".    interactions with the icm can also trigger star formation by increasing pressure on the ism .",
    "however , according to fujita ( 1998 ) and fujita & nagashima ( 1999 ) , this mechanism seems to be negligible compared with tidally - induced pressure or harassment - induced pressure that we describe below .",
    "tidal interactions with the cluster potential affect galaxies in several ways .",
    "the effectiveness of tidal compression in triggering star formation depends on the cluster mass distribution , but detailed calculations ( byrd & valtonen 1990 ; herinksen & byrd 1996 ; fuijta 1998 ) show that for clusters of mass comparable to cl0024 + 16 the process is only effective within the central @xmath184 kpc at most .",
    "tidal stripping ( merritt 1983 , 1984 ) removes mass from the outer regions of a galaxy ( typically at radii larger than the luminous component ) , thus altering the mass and cross sections for galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "modeling the cluster and galaxy halos as isothermal spheres with velocity dispersions @xmath185 and @xmath186 ( moore et al .",
    "1996 , 1998 ) we derive the following estimate for the _ cluster tidal truncation radius _ @xmath187 @xmath188 limiting the cluster region where tidal truncation is important for the luminous component of the galaxies inside their optical radius @xmath189 .",
    "less dense galaxies will be disrupted first , but typically only in the innermost regions ( 100 - 200 kpc ; moore et al .  1998 ) .",
    "removal of the diffuse gas reservoir will also be dominated by hydrodynamical effects and therefore we will neglect this mechanism in the estimation of regions where starvation is important .",
    "finally , we consider galaxy - galaxy interactions .",
    "harassment ( moore et al .  1996 ) arises from an interplay between the overall cluster potential  which is responsible for tidal truncation of halos and the high speed of galaxies  and the local density  which affects the interaction rate .",
    "schematically , the harassment rate @xmath190 scales with the luminous galaxy density @xmath191 and mass m@xmath192 as @xmath193    where we assume that galaxy masses are tidally truncated by the cluster potential . in the simple case where local density scales smoothly as @xmath194",
    " the harassment rate should be independent on cluster radius , within the validity limits of equation  [ eq : harass ] ( moore et al .  1998 ) . in practice",
    ", there is spread in local density at a given radius ( see section  6 ) , and therefore the rate depends somewhat on both variables . note the effects of harassment on the morphology of a galaxy depend not only on its mass , but also on its internal structure .",
    "for example , typical @xmath195 spirals in cl0024 + 16 could be transformed either into dwarf spheroidals or into lenticulars depending on the concentration of the mass distribution and on the disk scale length ( moore et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the merger frequency is a strong function of cluster radius , since it increases with density but decreases with velocity dispersion .",
    "schematically , the rate peaks around the virial radius of the cluster and declines towards the center ( see e.g. ghigna et al.1998 ) . in hierarchical clustering , galaxies located at any given time at the cluster center are those that formed earlier and had the highest probability of having undergone major mergers in their past ( springel et al .",
    "2001 ; diaferio et al .",
    "this distinction emphasizes the difference between regions where phenomena happen from the regions where their effects are observed , as discussed in section  [ ssec:2d ] .",
    "the regions of the cluster where the above physical processes are most effective are summarized in the upper panel of figure  [ fig : mechanisms ] .",
    "to interpret the observed distribution of galaxies across a wide range of cluster radius we also need to consider the time scales involved and thus , by implication , the galaxy motions .",
    "first , we estimate the time scales associated with the motions of galaxies in the cluster potential .",
    "as described in appendix  [ app : model ] , for a galaxy on a radial orbit , approximately , @xmath84 gyr is needed to traverse from the center to the virial radius , and @xmath196 gyrs to travel between @xmath140 and @xmath197 . as galaxies are not on purely radial orbits ( e.  g. ghigna et al .",
    "1998 ; van der marel et al .",
    "2000 ; vitviska et al .  2002 ) , a significant fraction of galaxies at or beyond the virial radius will never reach the cluster center .",
    "hence these travel times can be considered lower limits . for motions in any given direction ,",
    "the relevant velocity scale is given by @xmath198 ( where @xmath153 is the virial mass , see appendix  [ app : model ] ) , corresponding to velocities of order @xmath84 mpc gyr@xmath18 .",
    "second , a time scale can be associated with each of the _ physical mechanisms _ listed in section  [ ssec : zoo ] . starting with interactions between galaxies and the icm",
    ", ram pressure stripping in the highest density icm regions happens on a very short time scale ( @xmath199 yr ; abadi et al .",
    "1999 ) , while starvation according to our definition occurs more slowly , lasting up to several gyrs .",
    "galaxy - cluster gravitational interactions and tidal compression of gas clouds occur rapidly ( @xmath200 yr ) , while tidal truncation occurs on time scales longer than the cluster crossing time , i.e. a few gyr .",
    "harassment transforms the morphology and star formation properties on timescales of a few gyrs ( e.g. moore et al .",
    "1999 ) while mergers can take place on time scales of a fraction of a gyr and their morphological remnants would be undetectable after a few @xmath201 yr ( e.  g. mihos 1995 ) .",
    "third , we can consider the timescales for witnessing changes in the star formation properties of a system .",
    "after a burst of star formation , massive stars are dominant at most during the initial @xmath202 yr while signatures such as strong balmer emission lines such be detectable for @xmath84 gyr after the burst ( as k+a / a+k if the burst happened on top of a older stellar population ; dressler & gunn 1983 ; poggianti et al .",
    "the exact value depends not only on the prior and current star formation details but also on the actual observable ( e.g. barger et al .",
    "however , for simplicity in ths paper we will adopt a typical time of @xmath84 gyr for alteration in the colors and luminosity of a galaxy after a burst .    finally , the timescale associated with starvation is linked to that for gas consumption due to star formation .",
    "larson et al.(1980 ) estimate that it takes a few gyrs for a typical milky way galaxy to run out of gas , and cease star formation .",
    "thereafter , they show that the optical colors change slowly after the next few gyrs ( see also abraham et al .",

    "<S> we describe a new wide field hubble space telescope survey of the galaxy cluster cl0024 + 16 ( @xmath0 ) consisting of a sparse - sampled mosaic of 39 wide field and planetary camera 2 images which extends to a cluster radius of @xmath1 mpc . </S>",
    "<S> together with extensive ground - based spectroscopy taken from the literature , augmented with over a hundred newly - determined redshifts , this unique dataset enables us to examine environmental influences on the properties of cluster members from the inner core to well beyond the virial radius ( @xmath2 mpc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we catalog photometric measures for 22,000 objects to @xmath3 and assign morphological types for 2181 to @xmath4 , of which 195 are spectroscopically - confirmed cluster members . </S>",
    "<S> we examine both the morphology - radius ( t - r ) and morphology - density ( t-@xmath5 ) relations and demonstrate sensitivities adequate for measures from the core to a radius of @xmath6 mpc , spanning over 3 decades in local projected density . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of early - type galaxies declines steeply from the cluster center to 1 mpc radius and more gradually thereafter , asymptoting towards the field value at the periphery . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss our results in the context of three distinct cluster zones , defined according to different physical processes that may be effective in transforming galaxy morphology in each . by treating infalling galaxies as isolated test particles </S>",
    "<S> , we deduce that the most likely processes responsible for the mild gradient in the morphological mix outside the virial radius are _ harassment _ and _ starvation_. although more data are needed to pin down the exact mechanisms , _ starvation _ seems more promising in that it would naturally explain the stellar and dynamical homogeneity of cluster e / s0s . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find significant scatter in the local density at any given radius outside @xmath70.5 mpc , and that the same t-@xmath5 relation holds in subregions of the cluster , independent of location . in this hitherto unprobed region , </S>",
    "<S> where the potential of the cluster is weak , galaxies apparently retain their identities as members of infalling sub - groups whose characteristic morphological properties remain intact . only upon arrival in the central regions is the substructure erased , as indicated by the tight correlation between cluster radius and @xmath5 . </S>"
