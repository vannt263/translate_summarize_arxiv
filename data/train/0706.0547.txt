    "in a previous paper @xcite we addressed the nature of the near infrared background ( nirb ) at 1.6@xmath0 using nicmos observations in the hubble ultra deep field ( hudf ) .",
    "the area covered by the nicmos observations comprises the nicmos ultra deep field ( nudf ) which is smaller than the hudf .",
    "the nirb at 1.1@xmath0 and 1.6@xmath0 has a total power of 7 nwm@xmath4sr@xmath5 emitted by resolved galaxies , predominantly in the redshift range z = 0.51.5 .",
    "this is in contrast to the previous results from @xcite that claimed a peak flux of 70 nwm@xmath4sr@xmath5 at 1.4@xmath0 .",
    "the discrepancy arose not in the value of the total measured flux but in the attribution of the flux to the components of zodiacal emission , resolved stars and galaxies and an excess . in @xcite models",
    "were used to determine the first two components and the difference between the modeled components and the total observed flux was attributed to an excess .",
    "the @xcite measurements did not extend shortward of 1.4@xmath0 and the sharp drop in the flux levels between the 1.4@xmath0 value and shorter wavelengths was initially attributed by some authors ( eg .",
    "@xcite ) as due to the lyman break in very high redshift galaxies .",
    "our analysis measured the flux from the resolved stars and galaxies and the zodiacal background and found no excess .",
    "the difference was in the amount of flux attributed to the zodiacal background .",
    "our measured value was higher than the modeled value used by @xcite and the difference was equal to the flux attributed to an excess .",
    "we therefore concluded that unless there was a extragalactic flux component that was extremely flat , mimicking zodiacal flux , there is no excess and the near infrared background is resolved .",
    "@xcite also addressed the spatial fluctuations in the nudf field relative to the fluctuations found in deep calibration 2mass images at the same wavelength by @xcite .",
    "@xcite subtracted all of the resolved sources from the 2mass images and found fluctuations in excess of that expected by shot noise at long wavelengths .",
    "the excess was attributed to fluctuation power from galaxies at redshifts of 10 and above in several studies ( eg .",
    "a fluctuation analysis of the nudf f160w image showed that when sources were removed from the nicmos image down to the level that were removed from the 2mass image , the fluctuations were consistent with those found by @xcite . when sources were removed down to the detection limit of the combined acs and nicmos observations in the nudf the fluctuation power dropped by almost two orders of magnitude . since all of the detected sources had redshifts between 0 and 8 , this meant that the fluctuations found by @xcite were from galaxies in the redshift range between 0 and 8 .",
    "further analysis in @xcite of images that only retained sources in a given redshift bin determined that the majority of fluctuation power came from galaxies in redshift range between 0.5 and 1.5 .",
    "the fluctuation spectra from galaxies with redshifts greater than 4 were not detectable above the noise .",
    "more recent fluctuation analyses of _ spitzer _ irac images at 3.6@xmath0 and 4.5@xmath0 ( @xcite and @xcite ) interpret the residual fluctuations after source subtraction as being due to high redshift , possibly population iii , galaxies @xcite .",
    "this assertion appears to be based on the assumption that all galaxies below the irac detection limit must be faint due to their high redshift .",
    "this interpretation has been challenged by @xcite who did further source subtraction in the field using deep acs images to identify faint sources missed by the irac images .",
    "they found the removal of these sources greatly reduced the signal seen by @xcite and the signal must be due to sources with redshifts less than 8 that are visible in the acs images .",
    "@xcite replied that the excessive amount of area removed from the irac images in the source subtraction carried out by @xcite invalidates their result .",
    "modeling by @xcite indicates that the observed irac fluctuations may be consistent with those created by pop ii stars at redshift greater than or equal to 5 .",
    "the present study is motivated in part by a desire to investigate whether the observations in the nudf at both 1.1@xmath0 and 1.6@xmath0 are consistent with the high redshift interpretation of the the irac observations by examining the color of the fluctuations and their expected extrapolation to the irac bands .",
    "the location , size and pixel scale of the f110w image is identical to the f160w nudf image analyzed in @xcite .",
    "details of the image preparation are given in @xcite .",
    "the basic image production after the processing of the individual images is production of a background image which is the median of all of the individual images , subtraction of the background from the individual images and then combining the images with the drizzle procedure @xcite .",
    "the fluctuation analysis of the f110w image is identical to the analysis techniques used on the f160w image in @xcite and is not repeated in detail here .",
    "source subtraction is accomplished using the sextractor @xcite ( se ) pixel map where each pixel that is part of a source is given a value equal to the source i d number and all other pixels have a value of zero .",
    "the photometric redshifts derived in @xcite were used to identify the redshift of each source . due to the much higher resolution of the nicmos images relative to the irac images ,",
    "even the all source subtracted image retained 93@xmath6 of its pixels .",
    "this means that the objections of @xcite to the @xcite analysis do not apply here .",
    "all source pixels were set to zero in the subtracted image .",
    "there was no attempt to replace them with random noise .",
    "the small area of the subtracted sources means that this had no affect on the final fluctuation spectrum .",
    "figure  [ fig - fluct ] shows the fluctuation power at 1.1@xmath0 and 1.6@xmath0 . to determine the redshift distribution of the 1.1@xmath0 fluctuations the fluctuation analysis was also performed on the 1.1@xmath0 image with all sources except those in a given redshift bin removed . the 1.1@xmath0 fluctuation power versus",
    "redshift distribution is essentially identical to the 1.6@xmath0 distribution shown in figure 6 of @xcite .",
    "there is a peak near z=1 and no discernible power above the background for @xmath7 .",
    "to investigate the nature of the sources of the fluctuation power observed in the all source subtracted nicmos and irac images we calculate the expected fluctuation power color as a function of redshift using galaxy spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . at any given angular scale",
    "the fluctuation power for a given wavelength band is directly proportional to the power of the galaxies ( @xmath8 ) in that band .",
    "the power ratios of the bands at any redshift are easily calculated from the numerically redshifted model seds .",
    "the analysis of @xcite used 7 primary template seds labeled 17 going from early to late galaxies .",
    "the first 5 are observed seds and seds 6 and 7 are calculated from the models of @xcite .",
    "the properties of these models are given in table  [ tab - temp ] .",
    "template 6 is for a 50 million year old galaxy and template 7 is for a 10 million year old galaxy with the lowest metallicity available in the @xcite models .",
    "template 7 is similar to a pop .",
    "iii sed but redder than a true pop .",
    "iii sed ( see @xcite for the expected differences ) . although a pop .",
    "iii sed may be bluer than template 7 , the sharp increase in the 3.6@xmath0 to 1.6@xmath0 fluctuation power at high redshift is due to the lyman break passing through the 1.6@xmath0 and is therefore relatively independent of the sed to the red of the break .",
    "@xcite interpolated between the seds in increments of 0.1 to produce a final set of 61 different model seds .",
    "figure  [ fig - temp ] shows the distribution of the template numbers for all sources in the nudf with redshifts greater than 2.0 .",
    "the predominance of sources concentrate on templates 6 and 7 , therefore , we will take them as the most probable seds for sources fainter than our source detection limit .",
    "we use these seds and the effective response functions in the nicmos and irac filters to calculate the expected ratios of the power at redshifts between 0 and 15 .",
    "absorption in the inter - galactic medium is modeled according to the treatment given in @xcite .",
    "the horizontal lines in figure  [ fig - col ] show the observed ratios of the fluctuation power in the all source subtracted images using ; this analysis , @xcite and @xcite . since the excess fluctuation power attributed to high redshift galaxies by @xcite is at angular scales greater than @xmath9 the horizontal lines show the ratios observed at @xmath10 , the largest nicmos angular scale .",
    "the observed 1.1@xmath0 to 1.6@xmath0 fluctuation power ratio is consistent with the lower redshift template 6 predictions , but is incompatible with the calculated ratios at @xmath2 for either of the templates .",
    "this is strong evidence that the source subtracted fluctuations in the nicmos images are due to galaxies at @xmath1 .",
    "the observed 3.6@xmath0 to 1.6@xmath0 ratio lies between the ratios predicted by templates 6 and 7 .",
    "given the good match to the nicmos flux ratios for template 6 we would expect higher 3.6@xmath0 fluctuations than observed .",
    "the difference may be due to cosmic variance since the fields are different .",
    "it may also be that the much broader _ spitzer _ psfs subtract more background flux than the hst psfs . for @xmath11",
    "the predicted ratios become incompatible with observations .",
    "the 4.5@xmath0 to 3.6@xmath0 ratio is essentially independent of redshift at the redshifts considered and therefore does not contribute any information on the redshift epoch of the fluctuations .",
    "the apparent agreement between the predicted and observed ratios for those bands , however , is further evidence that the observed fluctuations are due to faint galaxies at redshifts less than 8 .",
    "an important question when comparing the nicmos and irac source subtracted remnant fluctuations is whether sources are subtracted to the same level in both data sets .",
    "although @xcite does not explicitly state the achieved source subtraction level , @xcite states that any remaining sources in the irac image must be fainter than 1020 njy .",
    "for the seds used in this study the irac limit corresponds to a nicmos limit of 4.59 njy . from figure 3b from @xcite",
    "the completeness limit is approximately 20 njy at 1.6@xmath0 , which is 2 to 4 times brighter than the irac subtraction limit .",
    "the sources for subtraction , however , were identified using detections in a combination of the acs and nicmos hudf images , with the acs images going significantly deeper due to their much longer integration time .",
    "figure 7 in @xcite shows that the detection limit in the acs f775w band is approximately 30 in ab magnitudes which is 3.7 njy .",
    "we can use the seds discussed in ",
    "[ s - fc ] to see what irac fluxes these correspond to .",
    "the results are shown figure  [ fig - cds ] .",
    "template sed 6 gives a limit of 20 njy and the bluer template 7 sed gives a limit of 10 njy which are compatible with the irac subtraction limits given by @xcite .",
    "the f775w band only removes sources at that limit for redshifts less than 3 but the acs f850lp long pass filter removes sources at that limit for redshifts up to 6 .",
    "the two data sets are compatible for all redshifts less than 6 . at redshifts between 6 and 8",
    "the nicmos subtraction limit is not as stringent as the irac subtraction limit . to account for this difference the horizontal solid line in figures",
    "[ fig - col]a and b would have to be raised by a factor of 2 to 4 but that would still not be compatible with redshifts greater than 12 . the redshift distribution of galaxies with nicmos fluxes less than 20 njy would have to be significantly different than galaxies above this limit for the z = 68 sources to contribute any power to the observed nicmos fluctuations .",
    "all of the discussion above is predicated on the assumption that the fluctuations observed after source subtraction are due to faint galaxies below the detection limit and not noise sources from the instrument or telescope . to check for the signature of gaussian distributed noise in the nicmos images we populated an image of the same size as the udf f110w and f160w images with random gaussian distributed noise with a variance equal to that found in the real images .",
    "an identical fluctuation analysis gives the results shown by the triangles in figure  [ fig - fluct ] .",
    "the random noise is close to the observed fluctuation power at small angular scales , but is far below the observed power at angular scales of @xmath12 and larger , the region considered in this analysis .",
    "we therefore conclude that the observed fluctuation power is not due to random noise components such as read noise , poisson photon statistics , or dark current in the nicmos images .",
    "we originally did not include the f110w image in the fluctuation analysis due to the possibility of residual flat fielding errors .",
    "the median of the 144 individual images measures any flat field errors very accurately . the f110w mosaic image created by replacing all of the individual actual images with the median image",
    "does appear to contain a component of noise due to small flat field errors .",
    "it is evident as the higher fluctuation power in figure  [ fig - fluct]a at spatial scales between @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "a similar signature is not present in the 1.1@xmath0 source subtracted fluctuation power .",
    "this indicates that the subtraction of the median image from each actual image before the mosaic accurately removes any flat field errors in the regions that have no detectable sources .",
    "these are the regions that contribute to the all source subtracted fluctuation power .",
    "we therefore exclude flat fielding errors as a source of fluctuation power .",
    "if the source subtracted fluctuations are due to faint , low redshift , galaxies then the 1.1@xmath0 and 1.6@xmath0 source subtracted images should be spatially correlated .",
    "a simple check for correlation is to subtract the f110w image from the f160w to test whether the fluctuations are reduced as would be expected if they are correlated .",
    "since the exact scaling is not known we subtracted the f110w image with scalings between 0 and 2 in 0.1 increments .",
    "the log weighted sum of the fluctuation powers for angular scales greater than @xmath9 versus the scale factor is shown in figure  [ fig - sub]a .",
    "there is a broad minimum for a scale factor of 0.6 , near the observed ratio of f160w to f110w fluctuation of 0.75 at @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ fig - sub]b shows the nested fluctuation spectra .",
    "this shows that the subtraction of the scaled f110w image reduces and alters the fluctuation spectrum at larger angular scales .",
    "it also indicates that the two images are partially correlated after the subtraction of all known sources as would be expected if fainter undetected sources were present in the images .",
    "the lower boundary in figure  [ fig - sub]b is the upper limit on fluctuation power contributed by high redshift , 1.1@xmath0 dropout , galaxies plus any remaining noise in the images .",
    "this limit is still above the gaussian noise spectrum shown in figure  [ fig - fluct]a and b.    at the largest scale of @xmath10 the residual fluctuation power in the f160w minus f110w image is 0.2 nwm@xmath4sr@xmath5 .",
    "if the residual is due to sources with redshifts less than 10 then the expected power in the irac 3.6@xmath0 band is 0.020.2 nwm@xmath4sr@xmath5 depending on which sed template is used .",
    "this is consistent with the 0.1 nwm@xmath4sr@xmath5 power observed by @xcite at the same spatial scale .",
    "if the residual power is due to galaxies at redshifts greater than 8 then the predicted power is in the range of 0.04 to a very large number depending on the sed and redshift .",
    "the predicted power starts to exceed the observed flux at a redshift of 11 for template 6 and at a redshift of 12 for template 7 . at a redshift of 13.5",
    "the predicted power exceeds the observed 3.6@xmath0 power by a factor of 10 for both seds .",
    "the residual f160w minus f110w power to 3.6@xmath0 power ratio is therefore consistent with emission from galaxies with redshifts less than 8 but can not definitively rule out that the observed 3.6@xmath0 fluctuation power comes from galaxies in the redshift range between 8 and 13 .",
    "redshifts beyond 13 , however , are not consistent with the ratio if the difference between the lower limit in figure  [ fig - sub]b and the gaussian noise is due to real sources",
    ". it should be noted , however , that the predominant source of fluctuation power in the observed sources comes from galaxies at redshifts between 0.5 and 1.5 .",
    "having the residual f160w minus f110w fluctuation power coming from galaxies with redshifts above 8 would require a remarkable suppression of the luminosity function of the 0.51.5 redshift galaxies at low luminosities .",
    "a final , but not as compelling , piece of evidence that the residual fluctuations are due to galaxies is that the 1.1@xmath0 to 1.6@xmath0 fluctuation power color is similar to that expected from @xmath1 galaxies .",
    "we can not completely rule out an unknown source of spatial power , which would be the same in both images due to their similar observation pattern and data analysis .",
    "however , in the absence of any known source of such spatial power we conclude that the nicmos source subtracted fluctuations are due to faint , @xmath1 , galaxies below the detection limit .",
    "these galaxies become evident in the fluctuation analysis because it utilizes @xmath14 of the pixels while the detected source power is contributed by only @xmath15 of the image pixels .    without far more knowledge of the irac instrument and data analysis procedures than we currently possess we can not make the same arguments for the faint galaxy origin of the irac fluctuations .",
    "we can say that the irac fluctuations are at the levels predicted for faint , @xmath1 , galaxies from the nicmos observations .",
    "since all four bands have ratios consistent with a faint , @xmath1 , galaxies origin we assume that the fluctuations in all four bands have extragalactic origins .",
    "we note that even if the irac fluctuations were due to noise , it would still support our conclusions that the irac fluctuations are not due to very high redshift galaxies .",
    "our basic conclusion is that the source subtracted fluctuations observed in the two nicmos bands and the irac bands at 3.6@xmath0 and 4.5@xmath0 are consistent with faint , @xmath1 , galaxies that are below the individual detection limit in the respective images .",
    "we also conclude that the observed ratio of 1.1@xmath0 to 1.6@xmath0 fluctuations is incompatible with a significant fraction of power from @xmath2 galaxies and that the ratio of the irac 3.6@xmath0 to nicmos 1.6@xmath0 fluctuation power is incompatible for galaxies at @xmath3 . in light of these observations",
    "we find no evidence that any of the observed fluctuations require flux from high redshift galaxies .",
    "of course such galaxies may exist , but we conclude that they do not contribute measurable power to the current observations .    the argument in @xcite for the irac fluctuations being due to high redshift galaxies appears to be based on the assumption that any sources fainter than their detection limit must be at high redshift because they are faint .",
    "examination of figure 3b in @xcite shows that the z = 07 galaxy luminosity function shows no break up to a completeness limit of 5 njy in the f160w band .",
    "this implies that there are many more low redshift galaxies fainter than the detection limit , i.e. galaxies that are not faint because they are at @xmath2 .",
    "a caveat relevant to this study is that if it is postulated that the irac fluctuations are due to galaxies with @xmath3 then the predicted 1.6@xmath0 fluctuations would be below our detection level due to the very high ratio of irac power to nicmos power at high redshifts .",
    "however if these high - redshift galaxies are the only source of the irac fluctuations , then a mechanism must be found to suppress the low redshift irac fluctuations predicted from the nicmos residual fluctuations . at this time",
    "we know of no such mechanism .",
    "this article is based on data from observations with the nasa / esa hubble space telescope obtained at the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy under nasa contract nas 5 - 26555 .",
