    "a large fraction of the spins are located near the surface of the nanoparticle , and their local environments have lower symmetries than the bulk .",
    "these spins may prefer to align to directions different from the bulk ordering direction , thus reducing the total magnetization .",
    "this surface anisotropy might contribute significantly to the total magnetoanisotropy and the hysteresis of the nanoparticle,@xcite e.g. ferrimagnetic @xmath0 nanoparticles .",
    "the bulk @xmath0 is a ferrimagnet with a neel temperature @xmath2  k. the ball - milled nanoparticles have an average radius of @xmath3 nm  @xcite and have been previously found to show a slightly open hysteresis loop at low temperatures.@xcite    in this paper , we use the heatbath algorithm and the wang - landau algorithm to calculate the finite - temperature properties of individual @xmath0 nanoparticles .",
    "the heatbath algorithm  @xcite runs at a certain temperature and external magnetic field .",
    "however , the heatbath algorithm samples does not directly generate the hysteresis , because the canonical ensemble it samples is dominated by the ground state rather than a meta - stable state , which contributes to the hysteresis .",
    "we use a continuous version of the wang - landau algorithm  @xcite to calculate the joint density of states of the nanoparticles , @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are magnetization and internal energy of the nanoparticle respectively .",
    "@xmath4 contains complete information of the nanoparticle at any temperature and in any magnetic field .",
    "bulk @xmath7 has an inverted spinel structure of lattice constant 8.34   .",
    "the eight tetrahedral sites in one unit cell are occupied by @xmath8 , while eight @xmath8 and eight @xmath9 are distributed on the sixteen octahedral sites .",

    "@xmath10 for @xmath8 , and @xmath11 for @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the magnetic structure of the bulk consists of heisenberg indirect exchange : @xmath12 where the summation is over nearest and next nearest pairs with nonzero exchange @xmath13 .",
    "the exchange constants @xmath13 are taken from ref .",

    "we model the nanoparticles by cutting off those spins outside a sphere of a given radius .",
    "the center of the sphere is randomly selected , which might not be a lattice point . following the previous work@xcite , we randomly remove a small fraction of surface spins to model surface disorder , and use uniaxial anisotropy for the surface spins : @xmath15 where the unit vector @xmath16 points in the direction of spin @xmath17 , and the unit vector @xmath18 is chosen to be parallel to @xmath19 where @xmath20 are positions of nearest neighbors of @xmath21 in the nanoparticle . as a result",

    "we use 0 , 2.5  k , 300  k , and 500  k for @xmath22 , to observe the effect of different strength of the anisotropy .",
    "we use the heatbath algorithm  @xcite and the improved wang - landau algorithm  @xcite in our simulations.the heatbath algorithm reaches equilibrium in presence of disorder and anisotropy much faster than the metropolis algorithm.@xcite the continuous version of the wang - landau algorithm  @xcite calculates the joint density of states @xmath23 \\delta\\left ( { \\sum_i { { \\bf s}}^z_i \\over n } - m_z \\right )     d \\mu ( { { \\bf s } } ) ,   \\label{rme}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the number of spins , @xmath25 collectively denotes all the spins in the model , @xmath26 is the volume measure of the phase space , @xmath6 and @xmath27 are the average energy per spin and average magnetization per spin . with @xmath4 in eq .",

    "if the system exhibits a first order phase transition , @xmath29 has double minima at constant @xmath30 .",
    "the free energy difference between the ground state and the metastable state as well as the free energy barrier between them are obtained from @xmath29 .",
    "using the heatbath algorithm , we calculated the specific heat and the binder cumulant of magnetization for bulk samples of different sizes with periodic boundary condition . with finite size scaling",
    ", we obtain the neel temperature for ferrimagnetic phase @xmath31 , which is about 4% higher than the experimental value .",
    "we also compared the simulations for bulk material to those for the nanoparticles .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows the effect of the size and surface of the nanoparticle .",
    "the peak in the specific heat of the nanoparticle appears at a lower temperature , about 200  k below that of the bulk material .",
    "the right panel shows the magnetization defined as @xmath32 .",
    "the magnetization of the nanoparticle is substantially suppressed .",
    "near the transition temperature , the magnetization of the nanoparticle gradually ramps up with decreasing temperature , while the bulk materials show a magnetization curve typical of the ferrimagnetic phase transition .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows @xmath4 for a typical nanoparticle with surface disorder and 387 spins .",
    "figure  [ fig2](a ) shows @xmath4 for a large energy range : @xmath33  k@xmath34  k , which illustrates the generic behavior of density of states of these nanoparticles . here",
    "the magnetization @xmath27 is the average @xmath35-component of the spins . at high energies",
    ", @xmath4 has a single maximum value at @xmath36 for constant @xmath6 . at low energies ,",
    "this single maximum is replaced by a relatively flat part , i.e. @xmath37 , which indicates a non - zero spontaneous magnetization .",
    "the energy range of fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) is sufficient for calculating temperature dependent properties for approximately @xmath38  k. the magnetization as a function of temperature and external field is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) .",
    "a spontaneous magnetization develops at about @xmath39  k , consistent with the reduced transition temperature shown in fig .",
    "since the model has continuous degrees of freedom , @xmath4 is logarithmically divergent near the ground state energy.@xcite thus , the lowest energy that a simulation can efficiently sample is restricted by its resolution in energy .",
    "[ fig2](c ) and ( d ) show @xmath4 at low energies calculated with higher resolution in energy .",
    "their energy ranges allow a temperature range @xmath40  k@xmath41  k when the @xmath4 is used to calculate temperature dependent quantities . in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) , a double - valley structure appears between @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "this structure is responsible for a finite coercivity , because the magnetization is blocked by it when the magnetic field is slightly reversed .",
    "the double valley structure becomes more pronounced at lower temperatures . on the contrary , in fig .",
    "[ fig2](d ) , the density of states of the same nanoparticle with a reduced surface anisotropy constant @xmath44  k , does not show any noticeable structure as in fig .",
    "[ fig2](c ) . the energy range in ( d ) is higher than that in ( c ) because of an over all energy shift caused by the change in surface anisotropy .",
    "however the energy range of ( d ) corresponds to a temperature range of @xmath45  k@xmath46  k.    the lack of a finite coercivity in fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) is due to the result of the rotational symmetry .",
    "obviously the surface disorder preserves the rotational symmetry .",
    "although there is a small @xmath22 , the surface anisotropy is too weak to destroy the rotational symmetry at temperatures much larger than @xmath22 .",
    "consequently , the nanoparticle is well described by superparamagnetism .",
    "when we assume a strong surface anisotropy , which is `` larger '' than the thermal energy @xmath47 and comparable to the exchange field on the surface , then we indeed observe various structures in @xmath4 , which are responsible for coercivity at finite temperatures .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows four examples of this behavior .",
    "we plot the bragg - williams free energy per spin @xmath48 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . clearly , all of these four examples appear to have a barrier of free energy between two states of spontaneous magnetization , also small oscillations on top of the barrier is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .    to observe the effect of the intermediate surface anisotropy",
    ", we used @xmath49  k and performed the calculation with the same set of nanoparticles that we used for the weak and strong surface anisotropy .",
    "we found most of them do not appear to have a noticeable depression in the density of states or a peak the free energy even at low temperatures with a few exceptions .",
    "one of them is the nanoparticle used to do the calculation for fig .",
    "[ fig3](d ) , it was found that with @xmath49  k , its bragg - williams free energy for @xmath50  k@xmath51  k appears to have the similar shape as shown in fig  [ fig3](d ) .    in summary",
    ", we have studied the magnetic properties of @xmath0 nanoparticles using two kinds of monte carlo simulations .",
    "we have found that only both surface disorder and a pretty strong surface anisotropy are required to develop the hysteresis .",
    "we have also noticed that a strong surface anisotropy is required because our model has a near - spherical shape .",
    "the surface anisotropies at different positions are likely to cancel each other leaving a very small overall anisotropy .",
    "in fact , we have observed that the total magneto - anisotropy energy is only of order @xmath52 .",
    "our approach is purely based on thermodynamics and presents no information on the spin dynamics of the nanoparticle .",
    "it is very likely that the surface spins form a disordered glass - like layer , which slows down the reversal of magnetization .",
