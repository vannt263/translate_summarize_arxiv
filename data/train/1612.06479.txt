    "ion irradiation is widely used for introducing defects and disorder in graphene films in order to modify their physical properties ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the measurement of the raman scattering ( rs ) spectra is considered an effective tool for probing the structure of disordered graphene and the density of introduced defects @xcite .",
    "typical rs spectra for disordered graphene consist of three main lines .",
    "the d - line at 1350 @xmath1 is related to the inter - valley double resonant process in graphene in the vicinity of a lattice defect ( edge , vacancies . )",
    "the 2d - line at 2700 @xmath1 , is related to an inter - valley two phonon mode , characteristic of the perfect crystalline honeycomb structure .",
    "the g - line at 1600 @xmath1 is common for different carbon - based materials , including carbon nanotubes and graphite .",
    "the appearance of the d - peak is ascribed to the breathing of carbon hexagons at the borders of the crystallite areas or in the vicinity of a structural defect , reflecting the loss of translational symmetry @xcite .",
    "the intensity of the d - line is used ( usually in the form of the dimensionless ratio of intensities of the d- and g - lines , @xmath2 ) as a measure of disorder in the graphene layer .",
    "in addition , a few minor lines connected with different modes of phonons can be seen in disordered samples : d-line ( 1620 @xmath1 ) , d+d-line ( 2970 @xmath1 ) and d+d-line ( 2450 @xmath1 ) .",
    "the positions of all lines are given for 532 nm excitation laser .",
    "the main aim of the present study is the investigation of the influence of long - term ageing ( about one year ) on properties of monolayer graphene samples irradiated by different dose of heavy and light ions .",
    "from one side , the ambient atmosphere is not fully reproducible in different places and laboratories , but from the other side , most devices are kept in ambient atmosphere , therefore this investigation might be of interest for specialists in graphene - based devices .",
    "in our previous studies @xcite , we reported the results of the investigation of the optical ( rs ) and the electrical ( conductivity and magnetoresistance ) properties of monolayer graphene samples irradiated by different doses @xmath3 of carbon ions c@xmath0 with energy 35 kev .",
    "six series of micro - samples ( 200x200 @xmath4 m ) provided with two metal contacts were prepared by means of electron - beam lithography on a common large - scale ( 5x5 mm ) monolayer graphene specimen supplied by graphenea company .",
    "monolayer graphene was produced by cvd on copper catalyst and transferred to a 300 nm sio@xmath5/si substrate using wet transfer process .",
    "graphene film of such a large size was not a monocrystalline .",
    "it looks like a polycrystalline film with the average size of microcrystals about a few microns @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we also include the results obtained on a series of monolayer graphene samples irradiated by heavy ions xe@xmath0 with the same energy @xmath6 = 35 kev . in this series , micro - samples were not fabricated , six areas 2x1 mm of the whole specimen 5x5 mm were irradiated separately with different doses of xe ions .",
    "in the rs spectra measurements , excitation was realized by the laser beam with @xmath7 = 532 nm and power less than 2 mw to avoid heating and film destruction .",
    "reproducibility was verified by repeated measurements in different areas and different samples of the same group .",
    "+ figure  @xmath8 shows the rs spectra for both series of samples immediately following irradiation ( a , c ) and after long - term ageing ( b , d ) .",
    "the changes of the main lines of the rs with increasing @xmath3 are as expected : in non - irradiated samples ( 0 ) the intensity of the defective d - line is small or absent which demonstrates the good quality of the initial monolayer graphene specimen . increasing the dose of the irradiation @xmath3 causes the d - line to increase and then broaden and decrease , while the 2d - line monotonically decreases and disappears .",
    "to compare results of irradiation by different ions , one plots the ratio @xmath2 and @xmath9 as a function of the density of structural defects @xmath10 , which is proportional to the dose of irradiation @xmath3 , @xmath11@xmath3 .",

    "this could be connected with existence of a backscattering in the case of bombardment of sio@xmath5 substrate by c ions which are lighter than atoms in the substrate , in contrast to irradiation by heavy xe ions .",
    "long - term ageing leads to an increase in @xmath36 in both series .",

    "@xcite this increase of @xmath36 explains the different behavior of the d - line for weakly and strongly irradiated samples shown in fig .",
    "for weakly irradiated samples , the d - line increases because of the increase of the square of @xmath28-areas . however , the overlap of increased @xmath28-areas begins earlier , at a lower density of defects , which explains the decrease of the d - line in strongly irradiated samples .",

    "@xmath20 that the peaks in the aged samples shift to higher frequencies ( blue shift ) .",
    "the largest values of the blue shift are 18 and 14 @xmath1 for the g- and d - peaks , respectively .",
    "there are several possible origins for the blue shift , including stress and the effects of doping @xcite .",
    "the doping - based scenario agrees with the assumption that the increase of @xmath36 in aged samples is caused by the capture of molecules from the ambient atmosphere .",
    "in series of c@xmath0-irradiated samples , the temperature dependence of the conductivity @xmath39 and the resistivity @xmath40 were measured before ageing , after irradiation , and the results were reported in refs .",
    "it was shown that @xmath41 for sample 1 with a low density of defects , @xmath10 , is accurately described in the framework of the weak localization ( wl ) model , whereby @xmath42 and saturates at low @xmath43 .",
    "the resistivity of more disordered samples 2,3,4 is governed by variable - range hopping ( vrh ) , characteristic of strongly localized carriers .",
    "vrh is described by exponential laws : @xmath44 , with @xmath45 at relatively high @xmath43 ( `` mott - law '' ) and @xmath46 ( `` efros - shklovski law '' ) at low @xmath43 .",
    "measurements of @xmath47 after ageing showed the increase of conductivity for all samples ( fig .",
    "@xmath48 ) .",
    "+ on the first glance , increase of conductivity could be attributed to the doping due to capture of molecules from the ambient atmosphere . however , the term dopingis more applicable to pristine or slightly disordered graphene when conductivity is realized by free charge carriers and can be changed by variation of the gate voltage in the field - effect - transistor ( fet ) geometry in both directions from the charge neutrality point @xcite . in our samples ,",
    "variation of the gate voltage up to + /-",
    "80 v weakly changes the conductivity , so the charge neutrality point was not achieved .",
    "this is due to the fact , that conductivity in our disordered highly resistive graphene samples is realized by localized charge carriers @xcite .",
    "localization is caused by the random potential relief , induced by the large density of negatively and positively charged defects .",
    "increase of @xmath36 can lead to smearing of this relief , weakening of localization and corresponding increase of conductivity .",
    "therefore an increase of @xmath36 due to capture of molecules from the ambient atmosphere would be better described as alterationrather than doping .",
    "+ figure  @xmath48 shows that before ageing , @xmath47 for irradiatedsamples 2 and 3 is governed by the vrh mechanism which corresponds to a straight line when plotted as @xmath49 vs. @xmath50 ( curves 2a and 3a in fig .",
    "@xmath48a ) , while after ageing , the reduced resistance deviates from a straight line and even shows a tendency to saturation at low @xmath43 ( curves 2b and 3b in fig .",
    "@xmath48a ) . as a result",
    ", the conductivity of these samples is better described by a plot of wl @xmath42 ( fig .",
    "@xmath48b ) .",
    "the transition from strong to weak localization after ageing can be explained by a softening of the random potential relief due to an increase of @xmath36 . for strongly irradiated sample 4 , the dependence @xmath47 after ageing still exhibits the vrh mechanism even though the resistivity decreases . +     and conductivity @xmath51 of c@xmath0-irradiated samples plotted on the scale appropriate for vrh regime ( a ) and for wl regime ( b ) .",
    "numbers near curves correspond to the numbers of samples in fig .",

    "there were only measurements of the raman signal from aged nanographite @xcite and from organic molecules absorbed on the aged graphene @xcite . in ref.@xcite , an increase of resistance after ageing in ambient atmosphere",
    "was observed in field effect transistors made from pristine graphene . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the influence of ageing was studied on the electrical properties of graphene - based transparent flexible electrodes .",
    "+ in this study , we show that long - term ageing of pristine and ion - irradiated monolayer graphene samples kept in ambient atmosphere leads to changes in the intensity and a blue - shift in the position of the d- , g- and 2d - lines in the rs spectra and to an increase of the electrical conductivity .",
    "our explanation is based on the notion of activated areas around structural defects in graphene .",
    "we suggest that the radius of this `` activated '' areas increases in the process of ageing which is caused by capturing molecules from the ambient atmosphere .",
