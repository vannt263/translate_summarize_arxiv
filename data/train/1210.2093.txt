    "despite of almost four decades of study of the glassy properties materials @xcite , the nature of the two - level systems ( tls ) , the ubiquitous hypothetical microscopic entities that are held responsible for these properties , is still not known . as a general picture",
    ", it is accepted that they represent dynamic defects , which are atoms or groups of atoms that tunnel from one minimum energy configuration to another .",
    "but these atoms are in general not identified and , even in the cases when they are identified ( like in crystals with defects ) , the tls spectrum can not be obtained based on a microscopic model .",
    "the study of solids with anisotropic glassy properties is especially interesting since this brings additional information about the tlss and requires a critical perspective on the standard tunneling model ( stm ) .    to identify the origin of the tls the thermal and acoustical properties of a number of crystalline systems with defects @xcite and quasicrystals @xcite at low temperatures have been investigated thoroughly .",
    "as expected , the glass like properties in both the disordered crystalline system and in the quasicrystals were revealed .",
    "however , a crucial difference in comparison with ordinary amorphous solids which possess tls excitations was detected .",
    "namely , a pronounced anisotropy in internal friction was clearly marked . as a consequence of that ,",
    "the baffling physical problem about the possible origin of the anisotropy appeared .",
    "indeed , there are two competitive ways for the explanation .",
    "_ first _ , the effect is explained by an anisotropy in the distribution over the `` orientations '' of the tlss in the ensemble .",
    "the interaction between the tls and the elastic field is described by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 $ ] is the strain field of the phonon  we assume everywhere summation over the repeated indices .",
    "the symmetric second rank tensor @xmath7 $ ] characterizes the tls and its `` deformability '' under elastic strain .",
    "the anisotropy of the physical properties is a reflection of the values taken by the elements of @xmath7 $ ] , which are determined by the lattice symmetries .",
    "bert , bellessa and grushko made a conjecture regarding these values from which they eventually recovered the anisotropic sound attenuation rates in decagonal quasicrystals @xcite .",
    "in the _ second _ approach @xcite  the one that we shall employ in this paper  the tls is characterized by a @xmath0 symmetric tensor @xmath3 $ ] and the coupling between @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath6 $ ] is made through a forth rank tensor of coupling constants denoted by @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "explicitly , @xmath8 and @xmath9^t:[[r]]:[s]$ ] .",
    "the elements of @xmath3 $ ] are determined by a unit vector @xmath10 , which is the direction of the tls , where s the structure of @xmath2 $ ] is determined by the symmetries of the host material . in this model , even if the tlss are isotropically oriented , the anisotropy of the system is imposed by the properties of the tensor of coupling constants .",
    "we applied the second approach to the crystalline materials of different symmetries with embedded tlss , assuming the isotropy of the orientations of the tlss @xcite and we calculated the attenuation of ultrasound waves of different polarizations and propagating in different crystallographic directions . not only that this model describes in a simple way the asymmetries of the glassy properties , but it also allows us to make predictions about the relative attenuation rates of sound propagating in different directions .",
    "in this paper we apply the model of ref .",
    "@xcite to the attenuation of ultrasound waves in quasicrystals and we obtain the attenuation rates along different crystallographic directions expressed in terms of the components of the tensor of coupling constants .",
    "we apply our calculations to the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite , which enable us to calculate the relations between some of the components of the coupling constants tensor .",
    "in order to better understand the distribution of the tlss in isotropic and anisotropic materials , we calculate the distribution of the elements of @xmath3 $ ] for an isotropic distribution of unit vectors @xmath10 . this distribution is neither simple , nor trivial , and by this we draw attention to the fact that it is difficult to guess it _ a priori _ , without a more detailed model .",
    "let us introduce the notations by presenting briefly the model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the free tls is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is called the _ asymmetry of the potential _ and @xmath13 the _ tunnel splitting_.",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath14 are @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the excitation energy of this tls . the groundstate will be denoted by @xmath17 and the excited state by @xmath18 .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian of the tls with the strain field is given by ( [ htls_hi ] )    the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are distributed with the probability @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a constant . if expressed in terms of @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the probability distribution becomes @xmath23 .    as usual , we work in the _ abbreviated subscript notations _ and write @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] as six - dimensional vectors : @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where the superscript @xmath26 denotes the transpose of a matrix or a vector .    as stated before ,",
    "@xmath27 . assuming that the tls is characterized by a direction in space , @xmath10 , the tensor @xmath28 is formed of the components of @xmath10 @xcite . in abbreviated subscript notations @xmath29",

    "the structure of @xmath33 $ ] is determined by the symmetries of the lattice , since @xmath34 is a scalar and should be invariant under coordinates transformations , whereas @xmath33 $ ] should be invariant under the symmetry transformations that leaves the lattice invariant @xcite .",
    "the absorption rate of a phonon  with wavenumber @xmath35 and polarization @xmath36by a tls is @xcite @xmath37\\cdot{{\\bf s}}_{{{\\bf k}}\\sigma}|^2\\delta(\\epsilon-\\hbar\\omega ) .",

    "we get the total phonon absorption rate , @xmath41 which may be put into the standard form , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the normalization constant of the phonon mode and @xmath44 is the ( average ) phonon - tls coupling constant .",
    "we have no model regarding the orientations of the tlss , so we shall assume that @xmath40 is isotropically oriented .",
    "the structure of @xmath33 $ ] should be similar to that of the elastic stiffness constants , @xmath45 $ ] , so for a decagonal quasicrystal should have the form @xcite @xmath46 = \\left(\\begin{array}{cccccc } r_{11}&r_{12}&r_{13}&0&0&0\\\\ r_{12}&r_{11}&r_{13}&0&0&0\\\\ r_{13}&r_{13}&r_{33}&0&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&r_{44}&0&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&r_{44}&0\\\\ 0&0&0&0&0&r_{66 } \\end{array}\\right ) , & & \\label{r_trigonal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47the axis @xmath48 is taken along the tenfold axis .",

    "the coupling constants , @xmath51 are similar to those calculated for hexagonal lattices in @xcite :    [ gammash ] @xmath52    where by @xmath53 and @xmath26 we refer to longitudinal and transversal polarizations , respectively .    while for the longitudinal waves the direction of polarization is obvious , for the transversal waves the direction of polarization is indicated by the second unit vector in the subscript of @xmath54 , in the eqs .",
    "( [ gammayxth ] ) and ( [ gammaxzth ] ) .    due to the isotropy condition in the decagonal plane , the coupling constants of the phonons propagating in this plane are independent of the direction of propagation if they have similar polarization .",

    "( [ gammayxth ] ) and ( [ gammaxzth ] ) with the results of bert et al .",
