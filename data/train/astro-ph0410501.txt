    "observations of distant type ia supernovae ( snia ) show that they are fainter than what the theory predicts for a universe described by a standard flat cold dark matter model .",
    "the most popular explanation is that the universe not only consists of luminous and dark matter , but also of large amounts of dark energy , a generic name for a homogeneously distributed energy component with negative pressure , @xmath1 .",
    "this is also verified by other cosmological probes such as the power spectra obtained from the temperature fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background @xcite and ( on smaller scales ) from large scale galaxy surveys @xcite .",
    "several mechanisms have been suggested in order to explain the faintness of distant snia without having to introduce a dark energy component .",
    "since the existence of a large dark energy component has been independently detected by a number of cosmological probes , it is unlikely that all the dimming is caused by dust or photon - axion oscillations .",
    "however , it is crucial to control all possible systematic effects in current and future sn surveys focussing on constraining the time evolution of the dark energy component .",
    "_ supernova evolution : _ some of the apparent dimming of distant snia could be due to the fact that their luminosities are redshift dependent and that the sne thus can not be used as standard candles .",
    "this could , e.g. , be caused by evolution of the sn progenitor @xcite .",
    "evolutionary effects can be searched for by comparing the light curve shape and spectra of sne at different redshifts and environments .",
    "most studies show that the luminosity properties are rather similar @xcite , but others have found variations indicating evolutionary effects @xcite",
    ".    _ gravitational lensing : _ since matter is inhomogeneously distributed in the universe , most line of sights to distant objects will probe a matter density significantly lower than the average density and the corresponding images will be demagnified relative to a homogeneous universe .",
    "it is generally accepted that gravitational lensing can not be responsible for all the observed dimming of distant snia , however the effect may still lead to a non - negligible bias that need to be corrected for , e.g. , by using information from the magnitude distribution @xcite .",
    "it has also been suggested that the large scale expansion of the universe can be affected by the inhomogeneities in the matter distribution .",
    "however , perturbative calculations show that this effect is probably negligible @xcite .    _",
    "photon - axion oscillations : _ it has been proposed that the photon flux from snia may be diminished because of photons oscillating into axions in much the same way as the electron neutrino ( @xmath2 ) flux , produced in the sun , is diminished because of oscillations into muon neutrinos ( @xmath3 ) and tau neutrinos ( @xmath4 ) . due to differences in methods and assumptions regarding the magnetic field strengths and plasma densities , different groups have reached different conclusions about the possible magnitude and the energy dependence of the effect @xcite .    _ intergalactic grey dust : _ it has been suggested that intergalactic dust could explain the observed faintness of high redshift snia @xcite .",
    "if there is dust along the line of sight , it would extinguish some of the sn light through absorption and scattering .",

    "we redo this analysis using the larger data set of dr1 with the correct expression for the density matrix evolution .    in section [ sec : oscillations ] we constrain the effects from photon - axion oscillations and in section [ sec : dust ] we discuss limits on the intergalactic dust attenuation . in section [ sec : summary ]",

    "the axion is a hypothetical neutral boson with spin zero originally introduced as part of a possible solution to the strong charge - parity ( cp ) violation .",
    "it has also been proposed as a candidate for the missing dark matter in the universe .",
    "an axion can decay into two photons , @xmath5 but also oscillate into a photon .",
    "since they have different spin , photons and axions can only mix in the presence of a mixing agent that preserves the quantum numbers such as angular momentum , e.g. an external transverse magnetic or electric field @xcite .",

    "we assume that the magnetic field is frozen into the plasma and subsequently given by @xmath28 with random direction @xcite .",
    "we also test whether our simulations are in accordance with current faraday rotation measurements .",
    "since the magnetic domains are small compared to the total travel length and the magnetic fields have random directions , the induced faraday rotation is too small to be used to rule out any of our investigated models . as the beam pass through the cells , the background cosmology and the wavelength of the photon are updated , as are the matrices @xmath13 and @xmath17 . in all of our simulations , we use @xmath29 $ ] . however , the cosmology dependence is weak .",

    "<S> distant supernovae have been observed to be fainter than what is expected in a matter dominated universe . </S>",
    "<S> the most likely explanation is that the universe is dominated by an energy component with negative pressure  dark energy . </S>",
    "<S> however , there are several astrophysical processes that could , in principle , affect the measurements and in order to be able to take advantage of the growing supernova statistics , the control of systematic effects is crucial . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss two of these ; extinction due to intergalactic grey dust and dimming due to photon - axion oscillations and show how their effect on supernova observations can be constrained using observed quasar colours and spectra . for a wide range of intergalactic dust models , we are able to rule out any dimming larger than 0.2 magnitudes for a type ia supernova at @xmath0 . the corresponding limit for intergalactic milky way type dust is 0.03 mag . for the more speculative model of photons mixing with axions , we find that the effect is independent of photon energy for certain combinations of parameter values and a dimming as large as 0.6 magnitudes can not be ruled out . </S>",
    "<S> these effects can have profound implications for the possibility of constraining dark energy properties using supernova observations . </S>"
