    "obtaining reliable metallicities in galaxies is crucial to measure and interpret the behaviour of metallicity with radial distance and the mass - metallicity relation .",
    "unfortunately , robust metallicity measurements in galaxies are notoriously problematic to obtain .",
    "metallicity of starburst or star - forming galaxies is routinely measured from region emission lines and two main methods are employed : the t@xmath2-based method and the _ strong line _ method .",
    "the t@xmath2-based method uses the flux ratio of auroral to strong lines of the same ion to measure the electron temperature of the gas @xcite .",
    "however , temperature sensitive lines are often too weak to be detected in faint distant galaxies and their measurement is challenging even for galaxies in the local universe specifically in the metal - rich regime @xcite . when the electron temperature can not be determined , one has to resort to abundance indicators based on more readily observable lines .",
    "such _ strong line _",
    "methods are based on the ratio of the fluxes of the strongest forbidden lines of typically o and h @xcite which are more easily detected than the weak auroral lines across a wide range of metallicity .",
    "unfortunately , well - known but unexplained systematic uncertainties , that can amount up to @xmath30.7 dex , plague the determination of the metallicity of extragalactic regions from nebular spectroscopy @xcite . as a consequence , the chemical abundances derived from strong - line methods display large systematic differences when applied to the same observational data ; and only relative metallicity comparisons appear to be reliable if the same calibration is used .",
    "very promising tracers of the present - day abundances in star - forming galaxies are evolved massive stars .",
    "indeed , a number of nearby galaxies have been studied using blue supergiants ( bsgs ) and results indicate excellent agreement with abundances obtained from the t@xmath2-based method in regions ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a growing body of evidence indicates that accurate metallicities over large distance scales as for bsgs can be derived also from red supergiant stars ( rsgs ) .",
    "rsgs are young ( @xmath4 20 myr ) and extremely bright stars , i.e. 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 l@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "their flux peaks at @xmath8 1@xmath9 m , therefore they are among the most luminous objects in a galaxy in the near - ir and are ideal candidates for directly measuring extragalactic abundances .",
    "rsgs are also very cool stars , with temperatures ranging from 3000 to 5000 k , hence their spectra show numerous absorption features @xcite .",
    "previous techniques to measure metallicity from rsg spectra concentrated on the @xmath10-band , where high resolution ( r[@xmath11@xmath8 20000 ) observations are needed to isolate diagnostic atomic lines from molecular absorption ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "even with the largest available telescopes , the need for high resolution translates prohibitively large exposure times for individual objects at a distance @xmath121 mpc .",
    "in contrast , the required observing time can be significantly reduced if one focuses on a narrow region in the @xmath0-band , where the dominant spectral features are _ isolated atomic lines _ of fe and the @xmath13 elements ( ti , si , and mg ) .",
    "indeed , in this spectral window accurate abundances can be measured even at moderate resolution ( r[@xmath11@xmath8 3000 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-band method was initially introduced by @xcite for individual rsgs in the milky way and has been extended and largely tested by @xcite in the association perseus ob-1 .",
    "@xcite checked the validity of this method at lower metallicity in the magellanic clouds using the vlt / xshooter and @xcite accurately tailored the reduction / analysis method for kmos observations of rsgs in ngc  6822 .",
    "@xcite obtained metallicities from rsgs across the disk of ngc  300 , a spiral galaxy beyond the local group , finding a striking agreement with the metallicities recovered from bsg stars and -region auroral line measurements .",
    "interestingly , this technique can be also applied to unresolved star clusters rather than individual stars @xcite . in merging and starburst galaxies intense star formation activity",
    "triggers the formation of super star clusters ( sscs ) , agglomerates of millions of young ( @xmath4 50 myr ) stars .",
    "sscs have masses @xmath12 10@xmath5m@xmath7 and are extremely compact ( with radii @xmath4 5 pc ; @xcite ) .",
    "once a ssc reaches an age of @xmath8 7 myr , the most massive stars which have not yet exploded as supernovae will be in the rsg phase . for a cluster with an initial mass of 10@xmath5 m@xmath7",
    ", there may be more than a hundred rsgs present which dominate the cluster s light output in the near - ir , contributing 90% - 95% of the of the near - ir flux .",
    "as their spectra are all very similar in the effective temperature ( t@xmath14 ) range around 4000  k , the combined spectrum can be analysed in the same way as a single rsg spectrum , as shown by @xcite . therefore , for sscs older than 7 myr the @xmath0-band technique can be used to measure metallicity at far greater distances than is possible for single supergiants .    following this line of investigation , @xcite analysed two young sscs in m  83 ( at 4.5 mpc , @xcite ) and ngc  6946 ( at 5.9 mpc , @xcite ) , finding metallicities @xmath81.5 - 2.0 and @xmath80.5 @xmath15 solar , respectively .",
    "this paper further extends the observational baseline and presents quantitative @xmath0-band spectroscopy of three sscs in the close pair galaxy ngc  4838 .",
    "ngc  4038 is the main component of the antennae system ( ngc  4038/39 ) , the closest ( @xmath820 mpc ) 0.08 ( @xmath8 22.3 mpc ) from optical and infrared observations of cepheid variables with the the wide field camera 3 ( wfc3 ) on the hubble space telescope ( hst ) . ] and youngest example of an ongoing major merger , involving two gas - rich disk galaxies that began to collide @xmath8 200 - 400 myr ago @xcite .",
    "galaxy mergers , and their resulting starbursts , are one of the basic building blocks of structure formation in the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) and represent an ideal laboratories for close up studies of the physical processes that were important at the peak of cosmic star formation @xcite .",
    "as such , the antennae has , over the years , been the favourite target for several multi wavelength studies of the effect of tidal interaction ( e.g. , @xcite ) and numerous n - body and hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the bodies of the galaxies are sites of extensive star formation ( @xmath320 m@xmath7 yr@xmath16 ; @xcite ) producing an ir luminosity of log l@xmath17 = 10.76 , which is is an order of magnitude lower than ultraluminous infrared galaxies , but still a factor of @xmath35 higher than noninteracting galaxy pairs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most of the star formation in this colliding galaxy pair occurs in the form of sscs ( @xcite ) , with masses up to a few times 10@xmath6m@xmath7 which are distributed throughout the galaxy @xcite .",
    "observational studies demonstrate that in interacting galaxies , the strong metallicity gradient observed in isolated spirals , can be disrupted by gas flows of metal - poor gas from the outer regions towards the centre of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the 24 ifus are managed by three identical spectrographs , each one handling eight ifus .",
    "the observations were performed in nod - to - sky mode with the yj grating , covering the 1.00 - 1.35 @xmath9 m spectral range with a nominal resolution of r@xmath83600 at the band centre .",
    "observations were carried out using the standard ab ab - like object - sky sequence ( i.e. one sky frame for each object frame ) in which we offset by 5  to sky , and each observation was dithered by up to 0.2 . during the observations ,",
    "the average @xmath0-band seeing was approximately 1.0 .",
    "in addition to science observations , a standard set of calibration frames were obtained .",
    "since we require high precision absorption line spectroscopy , we observed a telluric standard with the arms in the science configuration ( i.e. using the observational template that allows users to observe a standard star in each ifu allocated to a science target ) . during the observations 7 sscs",
    "were observed , but only three of those have sufficient snr ( @xmath12 100 , see @xcite ) to be used in our analysis . to reduce the data , we used the standard recipes provided by the by the software package for astronomical reduction with kmos ( spark ; @xcite ) .",
    "kmos ifu data cubes were flat fielded , wavelength calibrated , and telluric corrected using the standard kmos / esorex routines .",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : kmog ] , there are significant variations in both spectral resolution and wavelength calibration across the fov of each ifu as measured from sky emission lines ( see below for more details )",
    ". left uncorrected , these can introduce sky and telluric cancellation errors into the final spectrum , which can be the source of substantial problems for precision absorption line spectroscopy such as that presented in this paper .",
    "we correct for these effects with a process we call , _ kmogenization _ ( see also * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "we first take the rectified science and sky images _ prior _ to sky subtraction . at each spaxel in the ifu",
    "we fit gaussian profiles to the sky lines and we use them to determine both the spectral resolution and the higher order wavelength calibration as a function of spatial position .",
    "we then smooth the spectra at each position on the ifu down to a lower resolution , set to be @xmath18 , the pixels within the extraction aperture are always above this value . ] .",
    "we then extract the spectrum of the science target from an aperture with radius 1.5 spaxels around the flux peak .",
    "this narrow aperture minimises errors due to spatial non - uniformity , at the slight expense of discarding flux from the wings of the point - spread function .",
    "when the source is extracted , the wavelength axis is updated to include the higher order correction determined from the sky lines _ without _ interpolating the spectrum onto a new wavelength axis , as this can introduce numerical noise .",
    "the associated sky spectrum is extracted in the same way , and is subtracted from the science spectrum .",
    "since the wavelength calibration can change slightly throughout the night due to the rotation of the instrument , each sky - subtracted science spectrum can have a different wavelength axis . to account for this ,",
    "the normalised spectra are co - added onto a master wavelength axis whereby the flux at wavelength @xmath19 in the master spectrum is a weighted mean of the fluxes in the individual spectra which have wavelengths between @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "the methodology for finding the best - fitting model is described in detail by @xcite and @xcite which analyse 11 rsgs in perseus ob-1 ( [ z ] = 0.04 @xmath1 0.08 ) and 27 rggs in ngc  300 ( [ z ] = 0.03 @xmath1 0.05 ) , respectively .",

    "<S> we present a direct determination of the stellar metallicity in the close pair galaxy ngc  4038 ( d = 20 mpc ) based on the quantitative analysis of moderate resolution kmos / vlt spectra of three super star clusters ( sscs ) . </S>",
    "<S> the method adopted in our analysis has been developed and optimised to measure accurate metallicities from atomic lines in the @xmath0-band of single red supergiant ( rsg ) or rsg - dominated star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> hence , our metallicity measurements are not affected by the biases and poorly understood systematics inherent to _ strong line _ methods which are routinely applied to massive data sets of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we find [ z]= + 0.07 @xmath1 0.03 and compare our measurements to strong line calibrations . </S>",
    "<S> our abundances and literature data suggest the presence of a flat metallicity gradient , which can be explained as redistribution of metal - rich gas following the strong interaction . </S>"
