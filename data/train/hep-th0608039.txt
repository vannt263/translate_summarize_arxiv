    "recent work@xcite has shown that thermodynamic properties can be computed for large-@xmath0 supersymmetric theories .",
    "the approach is based on light - cone coordinates@xcite and the numerical technique of supersymmetric discrete light - cone quantization ( sdlcq).@xcite here we consider two - dimensional supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics with a chern ",
    "simons term ( sqcd - cs),@xcite dimensionally reduced from three dimensions .    light - cone coordinates@xcite are defined by the time variable , @xmath1 , and spatial components , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the light - cone energy and momentum are given by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "for field theories quantized in terms of these coordinates , the standard numerical technique is discrete light - cone quantization ( dlcq).@xcite space is restricted to a light - cone box @xmath7 , @xmath8 with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "momentum is then discretized as @xmath9 , @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 all integers .",
    "the limit @xmath14 is exchanged for a limit in terms of the integer ( harmonic ) resolution@xcite @xmath15 for fixed total momentum @xmath16 . because the @xmath11 are positive , the number of particles is limited to no more than @xmath17 .",
    "integrals are replaced by discrete sums .",
    "sdlcq@xcite is a special form of dlcq that preserves at least part of the supersymmetry algebra \\{q^+,q^+}=2p^+ , \\{q^-,q^-}=2p^- , \\{q^+,q^-}=-4p_. instead of discretizing the hamiltonian @xmath18 directly , the supercharge @xmath19 is discretized , and @xmath18 is computed from the algebra as p_sdlcq^-=\\{q^-,q^- } p_dlcq^- .",
    "for ordinary dlcq , one recovers supersymmetry only in the infinite resolution limit .    after a brief summary of the sqcd - cs theory ,",
    "we show how thermodynamic quantities can be constructed from the partition function .",
    "this requires knowledge of the spectrum of the theory , which we obtain numerically with an iterative lanczos algorithm .",
    "some preliminary results are presented and future work discussed .",
    "we consider a dimensional reduction from 2 + 1 to 1 + 1 dimensions of @xmath20 supersymmetric quantum chromodynamics with a chern ",

    "the theory possesses a useful @xmath32 symmetry@xcite a_ij(k , n^)-a_ji(k , n^ ) , b_ij(k , n^)-b_ji(k , n^ ) , which further divides the fock space between states with even and odd numbers of gluons .",
    "we then diagonalize in each sector separately .",
    "from the partition function , @xmath33 , we compute the bosonic free energy _ b=_n=1^_m_n^dp_0 ( 1- e^- p_0/t ) . and the fermionic free energy _ f= -_n=1^ _ m_n^dp_0 ( 1 + e^- p_0/t ) .",

    "the discrete density of states is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the degeneracy of the mass eigenvalue @xmath42 .",
    "the density can be written in the form of a trace over the evolution operator @xmath43 : ( m^2)=_-^e^im^2x^+/2p^+ tre^-ip^-x^+ dx^+ .",

    "the sample vectors @xmath45 can be chosen as random phase vectors;@xcite the coefficient of each fock state in the basis is a random number of modulus one .",

    "w_sn(m^2-m_sn^2 ) .",
    "the convergence of the approximation is dependent on the number of lanczos iterations per sample , as well as the number @xmath57 of samples .",
    "test runs indicate that taking 20 samples is sufficient .",
    "the number of lanczos iterations needs to be on the order of 1000 per sample ; using only 100 leaves errors on the order of 1 - 2% .",
    "some preliminary results are presented in the accompanying figures .",
    "figure 1 compares the numerical results for the cdf to analytic results , which can be obtained when the yang - mills coupling is zero .",

    "additional work is in progress to complete this study of finite temperature properties of two - dimensional sqcd . beyond this particular effort , one can consider finite-@xmath0 effects , with baryons and mixing of mesons and glueballs , and the full three - dimensional theory .",
