    "the general problem is to characterize the set @xmath28 of all admissible triples .",
    "if the emphasis is put on the ambient euclidean space @xmath26 , the equivalent problem is to determine the smallest dimension @xmath29 such that the triple @xmath23 is admissible .",
    "one of the main results of the paper is the following theorem which gives a sufficient condition for a triple @xmath30 to be admissible .",

    "however we emphasize that the computation of relevant cohomology / bordism obstruction classes is closely related to a question of enumerating classes of immersed curves in @xmath7 with a prescribed type and number of intersections with the coordinate axes , figures  [ fig : metamorf ] to [ fig : aaaa1 ] , and in turn to a problem of enumerating classes of signed , cyclic @xmath42-words , see example  [ exam : circles ] , equations ( [ eq:8521])([eq:8523 ] ) etc .    along these lines",
    "one obtains other , similar equipartition results , see proposition  [ prop : case0 ] , proposition  [ prop : recporec ] and corollary  [ cor : general2 ] .",
    "it is worth mentioning that some of these results have alternative proofs based on the ideal - valued , cohomological index theory .",
    "this approach has a merit that it produces fairly general and in some case quite accurate upper bounds for the function @xmath43 , theorem  [ thm : index ] .",
    "the general problem of studying equipartitions of masses by hyperplanes , or in our reformulation the problem of determining the function @xmath44 , was formulated by branko gr \" unbaum in @xcite .",
    "hugo hadwiger proved that @xmath45 , @xcite , which also implies @xmath46 .",
    "the case @xmath47 is answered by the `` ham sandwich theorem '' , @xcite , which says that @xmath48 .",
    "edgar ramos , @xcite , building on the previous special results in @xcite , introduced new ideas and considerably advanced our knowledge about the function @xmath49 .",
    "he showed for example that @xmath50 .",
    "the _ moment curve _ considerations , see @xcite or section  [ moment ] , lead to the following general lower bound @xmath51 as far as the general upper bounds are concerned , ramos proved that for @xmath52 , one has the inequalities @xmath53",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the bound given by ( [ upper bound ] ) is tight .    in computational geometry",
    ", the equipartition problem arose in relation to the problem of designing efficient algorithms for half - space range queries , @xcite .",
    "in the meantime better partitioning techniques were found , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite but the complexity of the equipartition problem remains of great theoretical interest .",
    "in combinatorial geometry , problems of partitions of sets of points and dissections of mass distributions have a long tradition and occupy one of central positions in this field . in this category are r.  rado s `` theorem for general measures '' @xcite , b.  gr \" unbaum s `` center point theorem '' for convex bodies @xcite , etc .",
    "survey articles @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite as well as the original papers @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , cover different aspects of the equipartition problem and give a good picture of some of more recent developments in this area .",
    "for example @xcite deals with partitions by @xmath1-fans with prescribed measure ratios , @xcite studies equipartitions by regular wedge - like cones and the relation with the well known knaster s conjecture , @xcite deals with general conical partitions , the `` center transversal theorem '' proved in @xcite reveals a hidden connection between the center point theorem and the ham sandwich theorem , etc .",
    "most of these results are obtained by topological methods .",
    "this orientation ultimately led in @xcite , see also @xcite , to the formulation of a program which unifies much of the discrete and continuous theory in the context of so called `` combinatorial geometry on vector bundles '' .",
    "a continuous mass distribution , referred to in problem  [ problem ] and theorem  [ thm : glavna ] , is a finite borel measure @xmath54 defined by the formula @xmath55 for an integrable density function @xmath56 .",
    "more generally , a mass distribution can be a borel measure @xmath57 on @xmath26 which is a _ weak limit _",
    ", @xcite , of a sequence @xmath58 of continuous measures in the sense that @xmath59 for every bounded continuous function @xmath60 . from here",
    "one easily deduces the inequalities , @xmath61 for each closed set , and @xmath62 for each open set in @xmath26 .",
    "given a continuous measure / mass distribution @xmath54 , a collection of @xmath1 hyperplanes is , according to definition  [ equi ] , an equipartition of @xmath54 if each @xmath1-orthant has the fraction @xmath63 of the total mass of @xmath54 .",
    "more generally , one can define an equipartition for any measure @xmath57 if the inequality @xmath64 is valid for each of @xmath65 open orthants determined by the collection of @xmath1-hyperplanes .",
    "this shows that theorem  [ thm : glavna ] and other equipartition results which are valid for continuous measures can be easily extended to more general mass distributions .",
    "for example the statement @xmath66 implies that for any set @xmath67\\times[7]}\\subset { \\mathbb   r}^{11}$ ] , a `` matrix '' of points in @xmath68 , there exist two hyperplanes @xmath69 and @xmath70 such that each of the associated open quadrants contains at most one point from each of the @xmath71 columns of the matrix @xmath72 .    in this paper",
    "we restrict our attention to measures which are weak limits of continuous measures which appears to be sufficient for all combinatorial applications . among the interesting examples",
    "are measurable sets , counting measures , @xmath1-dimensional hausdorff measures etc .",
    "in this section we collect most of the results needed for the proof of theorem  [ thm : glavna ] and other related equipartition results . for the readers convenience , in the first subsection we outline the general proof scheme while other subsections can be seen as an elaboration of some of the ideas used in individual steps .",
    "here is a general proof scheme that we follow in this paper and which in principle can be , with necessary modifications , applied to many problems about ( equi)partitions of masses .    1 .",
    "the equipartition problem , problem  [ problem ] , is reduced to the question of ( non)existence of an equivariant map or equivalently , to the question of the ( non)existence of a nowhere zero , continuous cross - section of a vector bundle .",
    "this is a topological problem .",
    "the topological problem is reduced to the question of computing relevant ( co)homology , or @xmath73-bordism obstruction classes .",
    "the obstruction classes belong to the associated ( co)homology or bordism groups .",
    "the computation of these groups usually involves a mixture of topological and algebraic ideas .",
    "the obstruction class can be , under mild conditions , computed / identified by a careful analysis of the equipartition problem for a special , sufficiently `` generic '' collection of measures .",
    "our primary choice are uniform / interval measures distributed along the moment curve @xmath74 .",
    "a geometric problem arises , involving the analysis of possible ways a curve , carrying collections of intervals , can be immersed in the coordinate two plane .",
    "the analysis of the solution set of all equipartitions for the special choice of measures , linked with the problem of immersions of curves in the previous step , leads to a problem of enumeration of classes of circular words in alphabet @xmath75 .",
    "this is a problem of enumerative combinatorics typically solved by poly ' a enumeration or m \" obius inversion technique .",
    "the relevant obstruction class is linked in step  ( 5 ) with a function which has a clear arithmetical / combinatorial meaning which eventually leads to theorem  [ thm : glavna ] .",
    "here is an example how one can approach an equipartition problem , in a direct and geometrically transparent fashion , via equivariant bordism .",
    "this is essentially the approach of this paper up to some technical refinements or detours involving equivariant maps and equivariant cohomology .",
    "suppose we want to prove that @xmath77 i.e. that for each measurable set @xmath78 , there exist two lines @xmath79 and @xmath80 which form a `` coordinate system '' so that each quadrant contains a quarter of the measure of @xmath72 .",
    "the problem itself is of course quite elementary and we use it here merely to demonstrate the general ideas .",
    "the _ configuration space _ of all candidates for the solution is the space of all ordered pairs of oriented lines in @xmath81 .",
    "if we fix an embedding @xmath82 such that @xmath83 does not contain the origin in @xmath84 , an oriented line @xmath85 in @xmath81 is seen as an intersection of @xmath83 with a unique oriented , central plane @xmath86 in @xmath84 .",
    "so the compactified configuration space is the manifold @xmath87 of all pairs of oriented , central @xmath9-planes in @xmath88 .",
    "we note that dihedral group @xmath89 arises naturally in this context as a group of all symmetries of a pair of oriented lines ( planes ) .    for a _ generic _ measurable set @xmath72 ,",
    "the collection of all pairs @xmath90 which form an equipartition for @xmath72 is a @xmath41-dimensional @xmath73-manifold @xmath91 . for example if @xmath72 is a unit disc @xmath92 , the solution set @xmath93 is a union of @xmath36 circles . here",
    "we do not make precise what is meant by a generic measure . instead we naively assume , for the sake of this example , that there exists such a notion of genericity for measurable sets / measures so that each measurable set @xmath72 can be well approximated by generic measures .",
    "moreover , we assume that for any two measurable sets @xmath72 and @xmath94 there exists a path of generic measures @xmath95 $ ] , so that @xmath96 is an approximation of @xmath72 , @xmath97 is an approximation for @xmath94 and the solution set @xmath98}}:=\\{(l_1,l_2;t)\\mid ( l_1,l_2 ) \\mbox { { \\rm is an equipartition for } } \\mu_t \\ } \\subset s^2\\times s^2 \\times [ 0,1]\\ ] ] is a @xmath9-dimensional manifold ( bordism ) connecting solution sets for measures @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "the group @xmath99 of classes of @xmath41-dimensional , free @xmath100-manifolds is found to be isomorphic to @xmath101 , see section  [ geometric ] , and the @xmath100-solution manifold @xmath93 , associated to the unit disc in @xmath83 , is shown to represent a nontrivial element in this group .",
    "it immediately follows than for any measurable set @xmath102 , the solution set @xmath91 is nonempty . indeed ,",
    "suppose @xmath103 .",
    "let @xmath104}$ ] be a path of generic measures such that @xmath96 approximates @xmath72 and @xmath97 approximates @xmath92 .",
    "if these approximations are sufficiently good , we deduce that the solution set @xmath105 is empty and that @xmath106 $ ] and @xmath107 $ ] represent the same element in @xmath108 .",
    "this is a contradiction since @xmath109 where @xmath110}}$ ] , i.e. @xmath93 would represent a trivial element in @xmath99 .",
    "[ rem1 ] it is worth noting that the scheme outlined above , if applicable , shows that a general equipartition problem can be solved by a careful analysis of the solution set of a well chosen , particular measure / measurable set , the unit disc @xmath92 in our example above .",
    "unfortunately , in higher dimensions the unit balls do not represent generic measures , i.e. their solution manifolds are very special and can not be used for the evaluation of the relevant obstruction elements in @xmath111 .",
    "instead one uses uniform , interval measures on the _ moment curve _ , see section  [ moment ] .",
    "we note also that although the program outlined above can actually be carried on , we will use a more standard and equivalent approach via obstruction classes and equivariant poincar ' e duality , section  [ equivariant ] . nevertheless , the idea of a generic measure is sufficiently interesting and attractive in itself and we hope to return to it in a later paper .",
    "it is often more convenient to work with equivariant maps and their zero sets rather than with measures and their solution manifolds .",
    "each measure @xmath54 leads naturally to an equivariant map @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is a free @xmath73-manifold and @xmath114 a @xmath73-representation .",
    "working with @xmath73-equivariant maps often yields more general results and it is sometimes technically more convenient .",
    "for example one easily constructs @xmath73-maps which are transversal to @xmath73-submanifolds of @xmath114 , thus avoiding the question of `` generic '' measures from section  [ g - bordism ] .      the _ configuration space / test map _",
    "paradigm , @xcite , is apparently one of the central ideas for applications of topological methods in geometric and discrete combinatorics .",
    "review papers , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite give a detailed picture of the genesis of these ideas and emphasize their role in the solutions of well known combinatorial problems like kneser s conjecture ( l.  lovasz , @xcite ) , `` splitting necklace problem '' ( n.  alon , @xcite , @xcite ) , colored tverberg problem ( r.  ivaljevi ' c , s.  vre ' cica , @xcite , @xcite ) etc .",
    "the idea can be outlined as follows .",
    "one starts with a configuration space or manifold @xmath115 of all candidates for the solution of a geometric / combinatorial problem @xmath116 .",
    "for example , the equipartition problem @xmath116 led in section  [ g - bordism ] to the configuration space @xmath117 of all pairs of oriented planes in @xmath84 .",
    "the following step is a construction of a test map @xmath118 which measures how far is a given candidate configuration from being a solution .",
    "more precisely , there is a subspace @xmath119 of the test space @xmath120 such that a configuration @xmath121 is a solution if and only if @xmath122 . the inner symmetries of the problem @xmath123 typically show up at this stage .",
    "this means that there is a group @xmath73 of symmetries of @xmath124 which acts on @xmath125 , such that @xmath119 is a @xmath73-invariant subspace of @xmath120 , which turns @xmath118 into an equivariant map .",
    "if a configuration @xmath126 with the desired property @xmath122 does not exist , then there arises an equivariant map @xmath127 .",
    "the final step is to show by topological methods that such a map does not exist .      our first choice for the configuration space suitable for the equipartition problem ( problem  [ problem ] ) is the manifold of all ordered collections @xmath128 of oriented hyperplanes in @xmath26 .",
    "in order to obtain a compact manifold , we move one dimension up and embed @xmath26 in @xmath129 , say as the hyperplane determined by the equation @xmath130 .",
    "then each oriented hyperplane @xmath131 in @xmath132 is obtained as an intersection @xmath133 , where @xmath134 is a uniquely defined , oriented , @xmath135-dimensional subspace of @xmath129 .",
