    "since white constructed the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique about five years ago@xcite@xmath3@xcite , numerical renormalization techniques have become very useful .",
    "the dmrg has by now been applied to a wide range of different problems beyond quantum spin systems , where it was originally used . today , people use it to compute , for instance , properties of two - dimensional classical lattice systems@xcite , thermodynamics of one - dimensional quantum systems@xcite etc . the dmrg and matrix product states @xcite@xmath4@xcite have proven to be computationally very efficient and to determine properties of many systems with unusually high accuracy .",
    "this paper aims at a better understanding of the underlying structure and the fundamental limitations of the dmrg .",
    "it has been reported that the dmrg is less accurate for gapless systems than for gapped systems @xcite@xmath3@xcite .",
    "this has motivated us to analyse the dmrg of gapless systems in more detail , which we do in two steps : first , we investigate the correlation functions ( which pertain to the wavefunction ) , and second , we study the excitation spectrum .",
    "we have choosen to study free fermions on a one - dimensional lattice as a paradigm of gapless systems .    in this work ,",
    "we show that the dmrg of a gapless system converges , for each choice of the number of kept states , to a fixed - point .",
    "the corresponding correlation functions are calculated by using an eigenvalue technique@xcite@xmath3@xcite , and the results show that this fixed - point describes with increasing accuracy the exact system .",
    "in particular , we address the question of how the dmrg handles algebraic correlations ( infinite correlation lengths ) , which is characteristic of gapless systems , in contrast to gapped systems having finite corrrelation lengths and determine a scaling formula for how the dmrg correlation length depends on the number of kept states . in dmrg applications ,",
    "this scaling formula may serve as a guide for how many states that is neccessary to keep in order to accuratly calculate correlations .",
    "we perform calculations for the particle - hole and the density - density correlation functions .",
    "in addition , we derive conditions for which types of operators that can give truly long ranged dmrg correlations . by introducing a gap , we also investigate how the dmrg correlation lengths change as the critical point ( free fermions ) is approached .",
    "a matrix product bloch - wave ansatz has been proposed for describing the excited states @xcite@xmath3@xcite of a system . in this paper , we have used the bloch - wave ansatz to calculate the excitation spectrum . in particular , we look at the spectrum close to the fermi points , where the gap closes . furthermore , it was recently shown@xcite that many half - integer spin systems have the symmetry @xmath2 .",
    "we prove that this symmetry is inherent also in the bloch - wave ansatz .    in dmrg calculations , it is important to check convergence with respect to the only source of error ( except from round off errors ) , namely the truncation of the hilbert space .",
    "a commonly used measure of the truncation error is the truncation of the density matrix@xcite@xmath5@xcite .",
    "however , that measure is algorithm dependent and therefore not universal",
    ". it would be desirable to instead calculate and use the overlap between states from different dmrg calculations as a measure .",
    "the problem is then that the states will refer to differently renormalized hilbert spaces . in this work ,",
    "we demonstrate how the matrix product formalism can be used to handle this problem .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : the system we have studied is defined in section [ fermions ] ; a brief introduction to matrix product states and the bloch - wave ansatz is given in section [ matprod ] ; we decribe how we calculate correlation functions and overlaps in section [ met : corr ] and [ met : overlap ] ; computational methods are outlined in section [ met : comp ] .",
    "the results are presented and discussed in section [ res : ] : convergence of the projection operator ( to a fixed - point ) and of the ground state is demonstrated in section [ res : conv ] ; correlation functions and the scaling formula are treated in section [ res : corr ] ; appendix [ fhatspec ] contains an important result for the determination of correlation lengths in a fermionic system ; conditions for true long range correlations are derived in appendix [ longrange ] ; the excitation spectra is presented in section [ bloch ] and a proof of the symmetry of the spectra is given in appendix [ blochproof ] .",
