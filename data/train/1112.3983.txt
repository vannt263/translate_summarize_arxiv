    "the problem is whether we can recover the obstacle @xmath37 , the transmission coefficients @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 on @xmath12 , as well as the magnetic and electric potentials @xmath41 , @xmath42 in @xmath37 .",
    "this problem was proposed in @xcite , where the corresponding inverse transmission problem in the absence of magnetic potentials was investigated . as it was pointed out in @xcite , in general one",

    "we shall be concerned with inverse transmission problems in the self - adjoint case .",
    "the importance of the self - adjoint transmission conditions comes in particular from the fact that they assure the continuity of the energy flux of the solution @xmath19 of the transmission problem along the boundary of the obstacle @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath56    working with self - adjoint transmission problems , the obstruction can be eliminated , as shown in the following , first main result of this paper .

    "the presence of the magnetic potentials complicates the arguments , and we have therefore attempted to give a careful discussion througout . when constructing the singular solutions , it becomes essential to assure that the unique solvability of the transmission problem can always be achieved by a small perturbation of the boundary of a domain .",
    "furthermore , this property is required when establishing some auxiliary runge type results on approximation of solutions of transmission problems in subdomains by solutions in larger domains , in subsection [ sec_runge ] .",

    "the minimal regularity of the boundary of @xmath37 required when working with lipschitz continuous magnetic potentials seems to be @xmath74 .",

    "this is important from the point of view of applications , since in practice , performing measurements on the entire boundary could be either impossible or too cost consuming . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the only available result in the presence of an obstacle , where the measurements are performed on an arbitrarily small portion of the boundary , is the work @xcite for the schrdinger operator without a magnetic potential .",
    "when no obstacle is present and the electric and magnetic potentials are known near the boundary , it is proven in @xcite , see also @xcite , that the knowledge of the cauchy data on an arbitrarily small part of the boundary determines uniquely the magnetic field and the electric potential in the entire domain",

    "proceeding in the spirit of inverse boundary value problems for the magnetic schrdinger operator , in order to exploit a fundamental integral identity , valid inside the obstacle , it becomes essential to determine the values of the tangential component of the magnetic potential on the boundary of the obstacle . to this end , in section [ sec_boundary_rec ] , we adapt the method of @xcite of the boundary reconstruction of the tangential component of the magnetic potential to our situation , by combining it with an idea of @xcite .",
    "with the tangential components of the magnetic potential determined , the exploitation of the integral identity becomes possible , and using the machinery developed in @xcite for inverse boundary value problems for the magnetic schrdinger operator , we are able to determine the magnetic and electric potentials inside the obstacle , up to a natural gauge transformation .",
    "section [ sec_scat_prob ] is concerned with the scattering transmission problem .",
