    "a number of deep , narrow - angle `` pencil - beam '' surveys for distant solar system objects have been undertaken over the past two decades , first appearing in the literature in tyson et al .",
    "these surveys avoid the issue of trailing losses in long exposures by taking a large number of shorter exposures , predicting the sky rate of motion of sources of interest , then compensating for this motion in software before finally stacking the images . due to the large number of rates at",
    "which images must be combined in order to properly compensate for the range of motions real objects can have , the orbital range over which this method is applied is limited to maintain computational feasibility .",
    "parker & kavelaars ( 2010 submitted ; hereafter p10 ) re - characterize the orbital limits of several published pencil - beam surveys and show that these orbital limits are poorly characterized in literature .",
    "as the re - derived maximum heliocentric distances these surveys were sensitive to ranges from @xmath1 au , we find that these surveys were sensitive to several dynamically interesting yet currently poorly constrained populations ; namely , scattered disk objects ( sdos , eg . , trujillo et al .",
    "2000 ; hereafter t00 ) and sedna - like objects ( slos , eg . , schwamb et al . , 2009 ; hereafter s09 ) .",
    "sdos are highly - eccentric , non - resonant objects that have perihelia that interact with neptune , and may be the source of jupiter - family comets ( eg . ,",
    "duncan & levison 1997 ) .",
    "slos are long - period objects that have perihelia high enough ( @xmath2 au ) that they are out of reach of the giant planets but aphelia not distant enough for galactic tides to have significant effect on their orbits .",
    "their current orbits require emplacement mechanisms that may be linked to dynamics of the solar birth cluster ( eg . ,",
    "brasser et al . 2006 ) , interactions with `` rogue '' planets ( eg . ,",
    "gladman & chan 2006 ) , or close stellar passages ( eg . ,",
    "kenyon & bromley 2004 ) .",
    "few objects ( one , in the case of sedna ) of either population have been discovered , and our understanding of these populations is severely hampered by these limited samples .",
    "here we use the newly - derived heliocentric distance limits from p10 in conjunction with a simple survey simulator in order to determine new limits on the sdo and slo populations .",

    "p10 generated a large sample of synthetic orbits that fall on the imaged field during the time of observations .",
    "these synthetic orbits spanned large ranges of heliocentric distance ( @xmath10 au ) , inclination ( @xmath11 ) , and eccentricity ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "ephemeris software was used to estimate the on - sky motion of each synthetic orbit generated , and then test the on - sky motion to ensure that it is within the ranges searched in the original survey .",
    "this characterization was performed for those surveys that included enough information in the literature to accurately reproduce the original search - grids .",
    "three surveys were characterized : fraser et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , fraser & kavelaars ( 2009 ) , and fuentes et al .",
    "each survey was found to be sensitive to distances considerably greater than claimed , and this limit varied somewhat with inclination . additionally , each survey was sensitive to inclinations as high as @xmath13 , even though the target maximum inclinations were @xmath14 .",
    "table 1 contains the derived limits and properties of each survey .    while p10 did not characterize bernstein et al .",
    "( 2004 ; hereafter b04 ) , we include it for analysis here .",
    "the authors claim that their survey is sensitive to motions of sources at distances greater than 1000 au and to inclinations as high as @xmath15 . because b04 imaged fields near quadrature ( while the three surveys above were taken near opposition ) , it is not straightforward to apply the results of p10 to this survey .",
    "however , we are confident that adopting 1000 au as a conservative distance limit for b04 is an adequate first - order estimate .",
    "with the characterized outer limits of several literature pencil - beam surveys for tnos , we can explore the upper limits these surveys put on distant populations .",
    "few detections from these surveys are followed - up after enough time has elapsed for orbital properties other than heliocentric distance and inclination to be measured with any precision . with these short - arc measurements ,",
    "it is difficult to identify the population any individual object belongs to unless it can be constrained by @xmath16 and @xmath17 alone . by determining the most distant detection in each survey under consideration and simulating a population that spends at least some fraction of time outside of this most distant detection",
    ", we can determine an upper limit for the size of this population based on the _ non_-detection of any sources at greater distances .",
    "two such distant populations are the sdos and slos .",

    ", we will test our models over a plausible range of @xmath23 .    for sdos ,",
    "heliocentric distance is sampled from two distributions .",
    "the first is a differential radial distribution with the form    @xmath24    with the exponent of @xmath25 as used in t00 when performing similar estimates of distant populations . in the t00 models ,",
    "synthetic sdos were generated over distances of @xmath26 au .",
    "for our estimate of the upper limit of this population , we use the same distance range .",
    "the second distribution is uniform in heliocentric distance over the same distance range , in line with the uniform distribution measured by kavelaars et al .",
    "( 2008 ) and returned by the dynamical simulations of volk & malhotra ( 2008 ) .",
    "we also model the slo population with two radial distributions .",
    "the first is the same radial distribution defined in eqn .",
    "[ dist ] , but over @xmath27 au .",
    "the second distribution is similar to that used by s09 , which is the intrinsic radial distribution of an orbit with sedna s @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the radial distributions used by our simulations are illustrated in figure [ radial ] , with the outer distance limits of the surveys under consideration marked .",
    "we generate a large number of objects drawn simultaneously from each distribution and for each object determine its apparent magnitude @xmath30 . for each survey , we then determine the following :    1 .",
    "is the object within the heliocentric distance limit of the survey ? 2 .",
    "given the object s apparent magnitude @xmath31 , a uniform random probability @xmath32 , and the survey s efficiency function @xmath33 ( clipped at 15% ) , is the object detected ( @xmath34 ) ?",
    "if an object satisfies both conditions , it is counted as `` detected '' by that survey .",
    "we also note whether or not the detection is outside the most distant @xmath35 detection made by the survey .",
    "we then scale the number of detections in each survey by the fractional area @xmath36 of the entire sky the survey searched .",
    "given this scaled detection count for each survey , we determine the mutual probability of non - detection of the synthetic population more distant than the most distant real detection for all surveys .",
    "we then determine the initial number of objects in the population required to return a mutual probability of non - detection @xmath37 ( @xmath38 upper limit ) , given this population model . for every @xmath23 we simulate",
    ", we take the corresponding derived upper limit on the population ( @xmath39 ) ) and convert it to @xmath40 km ) by assuming a 4% albedo .    by making detection a function only of @xmath18 and @xmath16",
    ", we are effectively modeling a population that is isotropic on the sky , which implies an inclination distribution of @xmath41 . for a population with an unknown inclination distribution",
    "this is as reasonable an assumption as any , and it significantly simplifies analysis .",
    "we note that t00 only considered inclinations as high as @xmath42 for sdos , and s09 modeled slos with an inclination probability distribution that was effectively 0 for @xmath43 . in order to compare to the earlier estimates on the upper limits of the sdo and slo populations , we scale @xmath36 in our simulations by a factor of @xmath44 , which has the effect of limiting the total area of the sky considered to that which inclinations @xmath45 can populate .",
    "since the field locations of the pencil - beam surveys considered here all have ecliptic latitudes near @xmath46 , the upper limits we derive only truly reflect an extrapolation of the population density on the ecliptic . in order to determine the total population limit @xmath47",
    "implied by our surveys given an arbitrary latitude distribution , one may simply multiply our upper limit @xmath48 by the integral of the desired latitude distribution @xmath49 ( where @xmath50 is normalized to 1 ) between @xmath51 of @xmath52 to @xmath53 radians , and then divide by the integral of our assumed distribution ( @xmath54 between @xmath52 and @xmath55 radians , 0 elsewhere ) over the same range : @xmath56 for example , assuming a latitude distribution for the sdos similar to that determined by brown ( 2001 ; approximated here as a gaussian with @xmath57 radians ) results in a correction of our upper limits by a factor of @xmath58 .",
    "since the perihelia of the sdo population extend well inside the outermost detections of the surveys considered here , the non - detection of distant sources is not necessarily a stronger constraint on the population than the total number of detections consistent with being sdos in the survey . to account for this",
    ", we also count the number ( @xmath59 ) of @xmath35 simulated detections returned by each survey where the distance at detection of the simulated object was less than the distance of any real detection by that survey .",
    "we assume ( as a limiting case ) that _ all _ @xmath60 detections with @xmath35 and @xmath61 au made by each survey were sdos .",
    "we then determine the probability of detecting @xmath60 given @xmath59 , and derive an upper limit when @xmath59 is ruled out at the @xmath38 level .",
    "if this upper limit is stronger than the upper limit derived by the non - detection of distant objects for a given @xmath23 , we adopt it as our upper limit for that slope .",
    "in addition to modeling the pencil - beam surveys , we have derived separate limits on the sdo population by passing the detections of t00 through our simulation .",
    "t00 had several verified real detections , which allow us to derive both upper and lower limits for the population .",
    "our upper limits in the @xmath62 radial distribution case match those estimated by t00 well , while our lower limits are a factor of @xmath63 higher than the values quoted in t00 .",
    "this discrepancy is likely due to variations between the uniform inclination distribution used by t00 and the uniform latitude distribution used here .",
    "figure [ sdo ] illustrates the results of our simulations for the @xmath64 sdo population , the sdo limits extrapolated from our simulations of the detections in t00 , and limits on the main kuiper belt ( mkb ) population from the `` nominal '' model of kavelaars et al .",
    "( 2009 ; hereafter k09 ) . for increasing @xmath23 , the pencil - beam survey upper limit on the population decreases , while the upper limit from t00 increases . for both radial distribution models ,",
    "the point where the two limits cross defines an absolute upper limit on the population for any cdf power - law slope @xmath23 ( given that radial distribution model ) .",
    "for the @xmath62 radial distribution model , this crossover occurs at approximately @xmath65 , with a maximum population size of @xmath66 km@xmath67 objects . for the uniform distribution model ,",
    "this crossover occurs at the shallower slope of approximately @xmath68 , with a maximum population size limited to @xmath66 km@xmath69 objects .",
    "these limits translate into @xmath70 times the upper limit population of the k09 `` nominal '' model of the mkb .",
    "the most distant detections ( @xmath71 au ) in each of the pencil - surveys considered here are all interior to the modeled perihelia of the slo populations ( @xmath72 au ) .",
    "the limiting magnitudes of these surveys allowed them to detect objects as faint as @xmath73 ( b04 limit at 70 au ) .",
    "while these surveys searched over 3,000 times less area than s09 , their flux limits are up to nearly seven magnitudes fainter than the limit of s09 at perihelion , permitting a significant improvement on the limits for steep cdf slopes .",
    "comparing the slo population estimates of s09 to the limits derived in this work is not straightforward .",
    "s09 was sensitive only to the largest objects in the population while the surveys analyzed in this work were sensitive to much smaller objects .",
    "we have modeled the detection of sedna by s09 with the same populations used to simulate the pencil - beam surveys ( with both radial distribution models ) and extrapolated the @xmath38 upper - limits the s09 survey put on the bright population to diameters as small as 100 km .",
    "figure [ sedna ] illustrates the results of our simulations for the slo population ( given both radial distribution models ) , the slo limits we derive from the detection of sedna by s09 extrapolated to the @xmath74 km regime , and limits on the mkb population from the `` nominal '' model of k09 .",
    "the large difference ( factor of @xmath75 ) between the two limits illustrates the sensitivity to assumed radial distribution models .",
    "the crossover where the upper limit from pencil - beam surveys becomes a stronger constraint on the slo population is approximately @xmath76 for the @xmath62 radial distribution and @xmath77 for the sedna - like radial distribution . at the slope where the limit derived here is stronger than the extrapolated s09 result for each radial distribution model ,",
    "our upper limit on the slo population is @xmath78 times larger than the k09 upper limit on the mkb for the @xmath62 distribution , and the largest the slo population can be for any cdf slope with this radial distribution is roughly 40 times the mkb upper limit . given the sedna - like radial distributions , the slo population can be up to @xmath791300 times more populous than the upper limit on the mkb ( with the peak occurring at @xmath80 ) before the lack of detections in current pencil - beam surveys would be incongruous with expectations .",
