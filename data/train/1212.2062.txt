    "dust is present throughout the universe , existing in a wide variety of astrophysical environments and playing a major role in star and planet formation . throughout their lifetime",
    ", dust grains are exposed to high levels of radiation and extreme temperatures , leading to the evolution of the amorphous , structurally disordered grains , that are characteristic of the diffuse interstellar medium ( ism ; @xcite ) , to the highly processed materials that were present in the early solar nebula .",
    "we are investigating this processing and mineralization of grains using laboratory produced analogues of cosmic dust . in - situ",
    "synchrotron x - ray powder diffraction ( sxpd ) is conducted on beamline i11 at diamond light source ( thompson _ et al .",
    "_ 2009 , 2011 ) and is complemented by sem imaging , raman and ftir spectroscopy .",
    "this has relevance to the existence of carbonates in circumstellar environments that are believed to form through solid - gas interaction of cosmic silicates with gaseous co@xmath4 at high temperatures ( @xcite ) .",
    "it also has relevance to processes in planetary environments where there is abundant co@xmath4 in the gas phase ( @xcite ) .",
    "we describe preliminary proof - of - concept work which demonstrates that this process can indeed proceed .",
    "beamline i11 is equipped to simulate extreme temperature and gas pressure conditions ( 20 @xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath5 1000@xmath7c , 1 - 100 bar gas pressure ) , through the use of a cyberstar hot air blower and gas cell capillary holder ( @xcite ; thompson _ et al . _",
    "these proceedings ) .",
    "amorphous magnesium and calcium silicates of composition mg@xmath8ca@xmath9sio@xmath2 , where 0 @xmath5 @xmath10 @xmath5 1 , were produced in the laboratory as analogues of cosmic dust , using an adapted sol gel method ( @xcite ) . to inhibit the direct formation of carbonate",
    ", the gels were dried _ in vacuo _ and the dried silicates stored under argon .",
    "powdered samples were loaded into quartz capillaries in a gas cell and mounted onto the sample stage of the diffractometer . the heating and dosing of samples with co@xmath4 was controlled remotely allowing real time , in - situ measurements to be taken .",
    "sxpd data were collected using a fast position sensitive detector ( @xcite ) , specifically designed for fast data collection .",
    "data were collected at regular intervals as the samples were put under vacuum and then exposed to co@xmath4 up to a pressure of 1 bar . while this is clearly higher than in circumstellar environments ( so the reaction rate is correspondingly higher ) , the nature of the experimental setup requires such pressure in order to provide adequate diffusion of co@xmath4 through the high packing density of the material in the capillary .",
    "further , the experimental co@xmath4 pressure is comparable with that which was likely to be present in early planetary atmospheres ( @xcite ) . after a number of scans at room temperature",
    "the hot air blower was introduced and the temperature was increased in steps of 50@xmath7c , over a period of @xmath11 hour , up to a maximum of 900@xmath7c ; two 4-s scans were taken at each temperature .",
    "the sol gels were dried in air and _ in vacuo _ , producing noticeably different end products . the gel dried in air produced solid , angular grains of a few mm to a few cm in size , varying from clear to white in colour depending on composition . on the other hand ,",
    "gels dried _ in vacuo _ produce a very fine white powder , with sem images showing a branch - like network structure with individual grains no larger than a few @xmath12 m in size ( see figure  [ semvac ] ) .",
    "raman spectra show that there is also a compositional difference between the samples dried in air and those dried _ in vacuo _",
    "( see figure  [ raman ] ) .",
    "the air - dried samples exhibit features of crystalline calcium carbonate ( calcite ) exhibiting characteristic features at 712@xmath13 and 1088@xmath13 , while samples dried _ in vacuo _ show a predominately silicate composition with prominent features in the 670@xmath13 and 1000@xmath13 bands .",
    "this implies that the carbonation of the samples is due to the reaction of ca with atmospheric co@xmath4 during the drying phase .",
    "ftir spectra of the samples were taken for a range of compositions and annealing temperatures .",
    "figure  [ ftircomp ] shows the comparison of four compositions , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "a peak ( arrowed ) can be clearly seen at 7 @xmath12 m strengthening with increasing ca content . also with increasing ca content ,",
    "the broad silicate features around 11@xmath12 m and 16@xmath12 m seem to weaken .",
    "figure  [ ftirtemp ] shows the spectra of a casio@xmath16 sample annealed at four different temperatures .",
    "few differences are observed at temperatures of up to 873k , but note the disappearance of the 7@xmath12 m feature and the rise of crystalline silicate features at temperatures greater than 873k .",
    "this indicates that any carbonate phase present within the sample becomes unstable at this temperature and breaks down .",
    "figure  [ cryst ] shows a sequence of in - situ sxpd patterns of mg@xmath17ca@xmath17sio@xmath2 exposed to co@xmath4 at 1 bar pressure and heated to 1272k over a period of a few hours .",
    "a feature indicative of calcite is present at low temperatures but disappears above 873k , again suggesting that the calcite phase is not stable at higher temperatures .",
    "the sample then begins to crystallize to diopside at just below 1173k .",
    "rietveld refinement of the powder diffraction patterns , using the topas - academic software package ( @xcite ) , has provided information about the relative weight percentages of the diopside and calcite phases within the sample as it is being heated .",
    "this shows an inverse correlation of the two phases ( see figure  [ wtperc ] ) .",
    "analysis of these data is still ongoing and the crystallization temperatures and effect of co@xmath4 on the samples will be much better constrained through further experiments and analysis . at this stage",
    "we provide proof of physical principle regarding the formation of carbonates rather than a direct simulation of any astrophysical environment .",
    "however by knowing that the carbonate phase becomes unstable above 873k , we can begin to constrain the astrophysical environments ( both circumstellar and planetary ) in which carbonates would be able to form and survive .",
