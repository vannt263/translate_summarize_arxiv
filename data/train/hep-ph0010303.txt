    "the modifications to @xcite that are necessary to incorporate diffractive collisions are relatively simple once it is noticed that pomeron exchange events in hadron - hadron collisions look very much like resolved photoproduction events in lepton - hadron collisions . in resolved photoproduction in electron - proton collisions , for example , the process is modeled by the incoming electron radiating a quasi - real photon according to a flux formula .",
    "the photon is then treated as a hadronic object with a structure function , which undergoes a collision with the beam proton .",
    "similarly , single diffractive interactions in proton - proton collisions may be modeled by assuming that one of the beam protons emits a pomeron , again according to some flux formula , which subsequently undergoes an interaction with the other beam proton ( see figure 1 ) . will automatically choose to radiate a photon from a beam lepton if a hard subprocess is selected which requires a hadronic structure for the beam lepton .",
    "examples would be choosing subprocess 1500 ( qcd @xmath0 scattering ) in an electron - proton collision , or subprocess 9000 ( deep inelastic scattering ) in an @xmath1 collision .",
    "all that is necessary therefore , to simulate a single diffractive interaction in a pp collision is to replace the photon flux with a suitable pomeron flux factor , and the photon structure function with a pomeron structure function , and run in ep mode rather than pp mode .",
    "the electron should then be identified with the proton which remains intact after the diffractive scattering .",
    "this process may be generalised to include sub - leading exchanges , and to perform double pomeron collisions and diffractive dis as will be described below .",
    "our philosophy for has been to make as few changes as possible to the code . in particular ,",
    "the common blocks are left unchanged , and only two subroutines have been modified .",
    "this approach has some disadvantages , in that we have left the event record unchanged .",
    "an intact proton will still appear as a lepton , therefore , and a pomeron will appear as a photon .",
    "we felt that such cosmetic inconveniences are outweighed by the overall simplicity and ease of installation and maintenance which are features of .",

    "the code can be obtained on request from the authors , or from @xcite .",
    "the routines supplied will function with all currently available versions of from 5.9 onwards .",
    "there are two routines which must be replaced : ` hwsfun ` and ` hwegam ` . `",
    "hwsfun ` has been modified to call the h1 diffractive structure function routine ` h1qcd ` @xcite , or the user defined structure function routine ` pomstr ` in the case of pomeron exchange , or to use a neutral pion structure function in the case of reggeon exchange .",
    "the pion structure is taken from the cern ` pdflib ` package via a call from ` hwsfun ` .",
    "the default reggeon structure is that of owens @xcite , as used in the h1 diffractive dis analysis @xcite . `",
    "hwegam ` substitutes the h1 pomeron or reggeon flux for the photon flux .",
    "the flux itself is calculated by the new routine ` flux ` .    if beam particle 1 is the electron ( playing the role of the diffracted proton ) , then setting parameter ` modpdf(1 ) = -1 ` and ` nstru = 6 ` will cause the h1 pomeron structure function to be used for beam particle 1 .",
    "similarly , setting ` nstru = 7 ` will select reggeon exchange , and ` nstru = 8 ` will select the user defined pomeron structure from ` pomstr ` .",
    "the parameters in the h1 pomeron structure function routine are set via an initialisation call to ` h1qcd ` .    to initialise the h1 pomeron structure function , the call should be made from the routine ` hwabeg ` as follows ; + ` integer ifit double precision xpq(-6:6),x , q2",
    "q2=75 ifit=5 x=0.1 call qcd_1994(x , q2,xpq , ifit ) ` + details of the parameters can be found in the ` h1qcd ` routine .",
    "the above parameters select the lo fit 2 . for this initialisation call to ` h1qcd ` , the values of ` q2 ` and ` x ` are irrelevant .",
    "the parameters ` q2wwmn ` and ` q2wwmx ` set the minimum and maximum pomeron virtualities , @xmath2 and @xmath3 respectively . `",
    "ywwmin ` and ` ywwmax ` set the minimum and maximum incoming proton energy fractions carried by the pomeron , @xmath4 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "the default parameters for the pomeron and reggeon fluxes are those found by the h1 collaboration in @xcite , for the case in which no interference is assumed between the pomeron and reggeon contributions to @xmath6 , as shown in table 1 .",
    "the fluxes are parameterised as @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 . in the case of the user defined structure functions , @xmath11 by default , and the normalisation",
    "may be included within ` pomstr ` or ` flux ` at the users discretion .",
    "the normalisation of the flux is arbitrary in the case of the h1 pomeron structure function .",
    "the ` h1qcd ` routine is implemented such that the generated cross section will always match @xmath6 as measured by h1 at @xmath12 , irrespective of the parameters chosen for the flux ."
