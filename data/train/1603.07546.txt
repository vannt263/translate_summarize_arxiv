    "quantum mechanics enables many breakthroughs that classical physics can not reach . however ,",
    "due to decoherence , there exist huge obstacles when quantum theory is applied to macroscopic systems . in recent years",
    ", nanomechanical fabricating technologies have achieved tremendous progress and provide ideal platforms to explore fundamental questions in quantum mechanics .",
    "many efforts @xcite have been made to approach the quantum limits of nanomechanical resonators ( namrs ) , for instance , ground - state cooling  @xcite and preparing nonclassical states ( examples including superposition states  @xcite , squeezed states  @xcite , etc ) .    in experimental implementations ,",
    "the fundamental frequencies of namrs range from tens of hz to several ghz , and as a result , the thermal environment significantly affects the coherences of mechanical modes . for namrs at microwave frequencies  @xcite , the quantum limit can be approached via cryogenic means ( in the range of @xmath2mk ) . if the energies of mechanical quanta ( phonons ) , are larger than their thermal energy , the quantum behavior of mechanical modes might be observed . however , for mechanical modes of much lower frequencies , the quantum coherences are fragile to thermal environments .",
    "usually , namrs need to be cooled to reach their ground states via methods such as side - band cooling  @xcite or active feedback cooling  @xcite . to operate the mechanical motions effectively ,",
    "namrs are often combined with other systems to form hybrid systems .",
    "examples include optomechanical systems  @xcite and quantum electromechanical systems @xcite . in the quantum regime ,",
    "namrs can be employed in fields such as quantum information processing  @xcite and quantum metrology  @xcite .",
    "phonon blockade ( pb )  @xcite is another purely quantum phenomenon , in which a single phonon in a resonator can impede the transmission of a second one .",
    "phonon blockade is an analog of another quantum phenomenon named photon blockade ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the interest in photon blockade is also motivated for realizing single - photon sources for quantum - information processing .",
    "compared with classical states , phonon and photon blockade states are described by the sub - poissonian distribution and can be interpreted as nonlinear quantum scissors  @xcite .",
    "photon blockade has theoretically been predicted in various systems and was first observed in an optical cavity coupled to a single trapped atom  @xcite . however , realizing and observing pb are still challenging for the following reasons : ( 1 ) the key point for conventional phonon ( photon ) blockade is the realization of a large nonlinearity with respect to the decay rate of the system .",
    "however , moving into the strong nonlinear regime often requires strict conditions which are hard to realize in most systems .",
    "( 2 ) the quantum coherence for namrs is very easy to be destroyed by any noisy thermal environment .",
    "( 3 ) detecting pb directly is also challenging : the position displacement for namrs is too tiny to be detected effectively under current experimental techniques  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the zero - point fluctuations for massive objects will limit the measurement accuracy .    to date , most of the studies on phonon and photon blockade are mainly based on nonlinearity ( kerr - type third - order @xmath3 nonlinearity  @xcite and second - order @xmath4 nonlinearity  @xcite ) and quantum interference effects  @xcite .",
    "phonon and photon blockade in @xmath4 and @xmath3 nonlinear systems both originate from the energy - level shift of multi - excitation states . to observe the blockade of the second excitation",
    ", the decoherence rate should be much smaller than the nonlinear strength .",
    "phonon and photon blockade can also be generated by utilizing optimal conditions for quantum interference : transition paths for the multi - excitation states are destructive and will cancel each other , leading to a small population of the second excitation .",
    "recently , a new mechanism called unconventional photon blockade has been predicted  @xcite , in which strong two - qubit entanglement and strong photon antibunching can be observed via the destructive quantum interference effect even in the weak nonlinear regime .",
    "reference  @xcite theoretically proposes how to realize photon blockade via quantum interference effects in a quantum - dot cavity ( without any nonlinearity ) .",
    "however , to avoid multiexcited states , the strengths and relative phases of the drive fields must be perfectly fixed when employing quantum interference to prepare blockade states .",
    "it should be noted that the nonlinearity can be intrinsic or induced via ancillary systems @xcite .",
    "phonon blockade in a kerr - type nonlinear system has been demonstrated in refs .",
    "inspired by these works , our goal in this paper is to study pb via an effective second - order nonlinear coupling , which remains unexplored . to obtain a second - order nonlinear coupling , a namr is assumed to be coupled to a cooper - pair box ( i.e. , a charge qubit ) @xcite with a linear longitudinal coupling ( @xmath5 coupling ) @xcite . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , coupling a resonator with a superconducting qubit of longitudinal form will induce multiphonon ( multiphoton ) processes .",
    "it is worth stressing that our system is based on the longitudinal coupling , instead of the transverse coupling assumed in the rabi model under the rotating - wave approximation . to our knowledge ,",
    "all former papers on phonon blockade have been based on the jaynes - cummings model in the dispersive limit ( i.e. , assuming large detuning ) .",
    "our proposal , in which a strong quadratic coupling between the charge qubit and the namr can be induced by choosing appropriate driving parameters of the charge qubit , has the following advantages :    \\(1 ) the intrinsic and induced effective @xmath3 nonlinearities are usually very weak ( about three orders lower of magnitude than the jaynes - cummings coupling strength ) @xcite .",
    "however , in this longitudinal - coupling system , the second - order nonlinear strength can be much stronger and , as a result , we can observe robust pb using lower - order nonlinear interactions .",
    "\\(2 ) besides using the qubit to produce pb states , the qubit itself can also be employed to detect pb .",
    "\\(3 ) comparing with the direct nonlinear coupling between a qubit and a namr @xcite , this type of effective coupling does not require the qubit and the namr to be resonant , and the effective coupling strength can be adjusted by controlling the strength of the drive field or the longitudinal coupling strength .    in this paper",
    ", we first describe the model hamiltonian in sec .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "iii , we obtain the theoretical results for steady states and give conditions to observe strong sub - poissonian phonon statistics and strong phonon antibunching in our proposal . in sec .",

    "this could be realized by increasing the strength of the driving field ( or the longitudinal coupling strength ) ; but both driving and coupling strengths should be controlled within certain regimes to avoid the rapid oscillating terms from destroying the blockade .",
