    "adsorption at various interfaces underlies a number of extremely important processes of utilitarian significance for technology and science . for example",
    ", it is crucial for separation of mixtures , filtration and purification processes .",
    "protein adsorption is involved in cell adhesion , inflammatory response , preventing artificial organ and biomaterial rejection , plaque formation and fouling of contact lenses .",
    "it is also prerequisite for chromatography , filtration , biocatalysis , biosensing , immunological assays , etc . @xcite .    since its introduction by feder @xcite , random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) became one of the major tools for modeling monolayers obtained during irreversible adsorption processes , at first for spherical adsorbates and , then , for more complex particles like squares , spherocylinders and needles @xcite . in recent studies",
    "rsa has also been successfully used for modeling complex particles using coarse - grain approximation @xcite .",
    "for example , a coarse - grain fibrinogen model successfully explains the density of adsorbed proteins for a wide range of experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "random sequential adsorption of generalized dimers has been mentioned for the first time in @xcite , however , in the context of rsa kinetics only and just for the case of distance between disks centers lower than disk diameter .",
    "aim of this study is to extend this analysis to determine all the main properties of obtained adsorption monolayers such as saturated random coverage ratio , density autocorrelations and available surface function ( asf ) , as well as to study adsorption of particles for which the distance between disks centers exceed disk diameter .",
    "such particles can possibly model many biological molecules like flexible dimers or dumbbell - shape molecules @xcite and , what is even more important from the theoretical point of view , they have not been studied earlier .",
    "a generalized dimer is build of two identical spheres of radius @xmath2 ( see fig.[fig : epsilon ] ) .",
    "width - to - height ratio for such molecules can be expressed as @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the measure of spheres displacement .    , and examples of three generalized dimers for @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . ]",
    "the case of @xmath8 has been extensively studied in @xcite .",
    "dimers were placed on a square flat homogeneous collector surface of a side size @xmath9 according to the rsa algorithm , which iteratively repeats the following steps :    - : :    a virtual generalized dimer of a fixed distance between spheres is    created .",
    "its position and orientation on a collector is chosen    randomly according to the uniform probability distribution ; however ,    centers of both the spheres are required to be on a collector .",
    "- : :    an overlapping test is performed for previously adsorbed nearest    neighbors of the virtual molecule . the test checks if    surface - to - surface distance between each of the spheres is greater    than zero . - : :    if there is no overlap the virtual particle is irreversibly adsorbed    and added to an existing covering layer .",
    "its position does not change    during further calculations . - : :    if there is an overlap the virtual dimer is removed and abandoned .    the number of rsa iterations @xmath10 is typically expressed in dimensionless time units : @xmath11 where @xmath12 r_0 ^ 2   & \\mbox{if } \\epsilon<1 , \\\\ 2 \\pi r_0 ^ 2 & \\mbox { otherwise } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] is an area covered by a single dimer , and @xmath13 is a collector surface area .",
    "simulation is halted after the number of steps corresponding to @xmath14 .",
    "to improve statistics , @xmath15 independent simulations were performed for a single generalized dimer model . during the simulations ,",
    "the coverage ratio @xmath16 has been measured : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the number of adsorbed molecules after dimensionless time @xmath19 .",
    "obtained example coverages are presented in fig.[fig : examples ] .    :",
    "@xmath20 , @xmath5 , and @xmath21 at the end of the simulation .",
    "the coverage ratio @xmath16 for presented snapshots are lower by about 0.5% from saturated random coverage ratio @xmath22    .",
    "[ fig : examples ]    the most important parameter which can be measured in numerical simulations is saturated random coverage ratio @xmath23 , as it can be easily obtained experimentally and thus used for the comparison . however",
    ", simulations involve a finite number of rsa algorithm steps . therefore , to determine @xmath24 , knowledge about rsa kinetics is essential .      as observed by feder @xcite and",
    "confirmed by later analitical studies @xcite , the rsa kinetics for spheres adsorption on a flat collector is governed by the following power law : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a coverage ratio after time @xmath19 and @xmath27 is a collector dimension .",
    "the above relation , known as feder s law , has been also proved numerically for one- to eight- dimensional collectors @xcite as well as for fractal collectors having @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "it is also valid for rsa of anisotropic particles on a flat collector @xcite , however , in this case , @xmath29 , which could be explained by additional degree of freedom of an adsorbate particle @xcite .    in our case , the power law ( [ fl ] )",
    "is fulfilled for all studied particles ( see fig.[fig : fl ] ) .    .",
    "inset shows the exponent in eq.([fl ] ) determined using least square fit method . ]    for a very small anisotropy ( @xmath30 ) , the rsa kinetics is similar to the one observed for disks ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "then , transition to @xmath29  the characteristic value for anisotropic adsorbates  occurs .",
    "interestingly , when disks are separated ( @xmath32 ) , parameter @xmath27 increases up to @xmath33 . around @xmath34 maximum",
    "is observed ; for such anisotropy , a disk from one generalized dimers can fit between disks belonging to other particle . on the one hand",
    ", it allows denser packing , but on the other hand it slows down the kinetics as it is hard to randomly place a particle in a such restricted area .",
    "having determined the value of exponent @xmath27 , eq.([fl ] ) could be transformed to linear relation @xmath35 , where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is a constant coefficient .",
    "approximation of the function for @xmath38 gives the saturated random coverage ratio presented in fig.[fig : qmax ] .",
    "is approximately @xmath39 and is smaller than the dot size .",
    "lines have been drawn to guide the eye . dashed line corresponds to saturated random coverage ratio for disks on a flat collector @xcite . ]    for @xmath30 , @xmath24 for a generalized dimer is the same as for disks .",
    "for @xmath5 , a slight increase up to @xmath40 can be observed .",
    "then , the saturated coverage decreases because the amount of blocked surface grows faster than dimer area .",
    "the minimum is reached around @xmath7 when particles disks are separated , but the distance between them is too small to be filled up by another molecule . for @xmath41 , it becomes possible , so the next local maximum is reached . for large @xmath4 , saturated random coverage seems to approach again the value known for rsa of disks .",
    "available surface function ( asf ) describes probability of placing subsequent particle on a collector as a function of coverage , and therefore can be easily estimated using rsa simulations .",
    "it can be also measured experimentally @xcite .",
    "asf is important for at least two reasons .",
    "firstly , together with the model of a specific transport mechanism , responsible for bringing particles to the close proximity of a collector surface , it allows to predict kinetics of the monolayer growth @xcite .",
    "secondly , the polynomial expansion of asf for low @xmath16 : @xmath42 is closely related to the viral expansion of the state equation of a formed monolayer .",
    "for example , second and third viral coefficients are @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noticing that coefficient @xmath45 corresponds to the surface area blocked by a single particle , whereas @xmath46 denotes a cross - section of the area blocked by two independent molecules .",
    "their dependence on anisotropy parameter is shown in fig.[fig : c1c2 ] .     and @xmath46 ( inset ) coefficients on dimer anisotropy @xmath4 .",
    "dots are simulation data .",
    "solid lines have been drawn to guide the eye . ]    just like for saturated coverage ratio , for small anisotropy , both the coefficient are equal to their values known from disks monolayers : @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "on the other hand , for a large distance between disks in the generalized dimer , it is expected that @xmath49 and @xmath50 . observed values in fig.[fig :",
    "c1c2 ] are slightly lower , probably due to not large enough @xmath4 .",
    "transition between those two limits occurs mainly between @xmath8 and @xmath41 , which is directly connected with increasing probability of two different particles crossing .",
    "saturated random coverage ratio describes mean density of adsorbed particles inside formed adsorption monolayer .",
    "more information about the monolayer structure can be acquired by analyzing density autocorrelation function , which is usually defined as a normalized probability of finding other particle in specified distance range : @xmath51 here @xmath52 is the probability of finding two disks in a distance between @xmath53 and @xmath54 , measured between their geometric centers .",
    "parameter @xmath55 is the mean density of particles inside a covering layer .",
    "such a normalization leads to @xmath56 . in the case of spherical particles",
    ", @xmath57 has a logarithmic singularity in the touching limit @xcite and superexponential decay at large distances @xcite .    .",
    "distance ( in @xmath2 units ) is measured between centers of different disks , no matter whether they come from the same or different dimers .",
    "autocorrelation function was measured for layers obtained at the end of simulations .",
    "their coverage ratio was about @xmath58 smaller than @xmath24 . ]    as shown in fig.[fig : g ] , when disks in a single particle are well separated ( @xmath59 ) the autocorrelation function is nearly the same as for ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "moreover , all plots are almost the same for large enough @xmath53 , however , local maxima , resulting from a fixed distance between disks in a single particle , can appear . to understand this phenomenon",
    "let s focus on one specific case , e.g. @xmath5 .",
    "as the coverage is saturated closest particles are nearly touching themselves ( see fig.[fig : g_exp ] ) .    ) taken from saturated random coverage .",
    "arrows points distances between disks from different particles . in case",
    "a ) the distance is sligtly higher than @xmath61 wheras in cases b ) and c ) it is equal about @xmath62 . ]    therefore , it is clear that distance between centers of touching disks is only slightly higher than @xmath61 ( fig.[fig : g_exp]a ) , and , as it is a common situation in saturated coverage , the density autocorrelation function will show a maximum there .",
    "however , the distance between the touching disk and the other one in second particle is most likely around @xmath62 ( fig.[fig : g_exp]b and [ fig : g_exp]c ) .",
    "therefore , for @xmath5 the density autocorrelation function has another maximum at @xmath63 .",
    "it is worth to notice that for small @xmath4 the first maximum at @xmath64 could be smaller than the second maximum ( see fig.[fig : g ] for @xmath65 ) . on the other hand , for @xmath66",
    "there is also a maximum at @xmath67 , which corresponds to distance between disks in the same dimers .",
    "as mentioned above , parameter @xmath27 in eq.([fl ] ) corresponds to a number of degrees of freedom of adsorbate particle .",
    "therefore in two dimensional case the transition between @xmath68 and @xmath29 has been observed . in three dimension",
    "a sphere has @xmath29 degrees of freedom , whereas dimer ( @xmath8 ) is described by two additional angles , which determine its orientation ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "it is interesting to see if here rsa kinetics behaves similarly as in 2d case , and especially where the transition point is . to check this ,",
    "additional simulations were performed .",
    "generalized dimers build of two spheres of radius @xmath2 were placed randomly in a cubic box of side size @xmath70 .",
    "the number of rsa algorithm steps in a single simulation expressed in dimensionless time units ( [ eq : dimlesstime ] ) was equal to @xmath71 , as in 2d case , but here @xmath72 r_0 ^ 3   & \\mbox{if } \\epsilon<1 , \\\\ \\frac{8}{3 } \\pi r_0 ^ 3 & \\mbox { otherwise } , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] results are presented in fig.[fig:3d ] .    .",
    "the dashed line corresponds to @xmath73 , which is the saturated random coverage ratio of spheres in three dimensional space @xcite .",
    "the solid line is to guide the eye .",
    "inset shows the exponent in eq.([fl ] ) determined using least square fit method dependence on particle anisotropy . ]    as expected , for small anisotropy rsa kinetics is governed by @xmath29 exponent .",
    "this changes around @xmath74 when the exponent starts to increase .",
    "it is worth to remind , than in two dimensional case this growth started at @xmath20 . for large anisotropy ( @xmath75 ) , when spheres in a dimer are separated , parameter @xmath27 is significantly higher than molecules number of degree of freedom .",
    "the dependence of the saturated random coverage ratio on anisotropy @xmath4 is qualitatively same as in two - dimensional case except that there is no sharp maximum at @xmath8 .",
    "the slight shift between measured coverage ratio and its values determined for spheres in @xcite are probably due to different boundary conditions . here , the three dimensional cube containing molecules was fixed , whereas in @xcite periodic boundary conditions were used .",
    "the rsa kinetics of generalized dimers depends strongly on particle anisotropy . in two dimensional case ,",
    "the exponent in eq.[fl ] varies from @xmath68 , known from spheres adsorption , to @xmath76 , with surprisingly small level of anisotropy ( @xmath20 ) inducing its increase to @xmath77 , typical for an anisotropic particle . in three dimensions exponent @xmath27 varies from @xmath29 for small anisotropy ( @xmath78 ) to @xmath79 for @xmath75 .",
    "the saturated random coverage ratio is similar to the one for disks for @xmath80 and @xmath81 . for intermediate anisotropy , it reaches maximum @xmath82 for @xmath5 and minimum @xmath83 around @xmath84 . in three dimensions ,",
    "results are qualitatively same with @xmath24 varying from @xmath85 for @xmath86 to @xmath87 for @xmath88 .",
    "viral expansion coefficient for small and large @xmath4 are the same as for disks , keeping in mind that for large @xmath4 , single particle contains two of them .",
    "the transition between these two limits takes place for @xmath89 .",
    "the density autocorrelation behaves similarly as in the case of disks ; however , for small @xmath4 , its plot is shifted accordingly to the displacement of disks within the dimer .",
