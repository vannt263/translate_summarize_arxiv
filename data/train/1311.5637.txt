    "after the alignments , a down slope appears indicating the decreasing deformation which is also in accordance with the triaxial deformation evolving .",
    "there are some discrepancies between the experimental results and our calculations at low spins for the nucleus @xmath5zr because the deformation is considerably soft as discussed above . at higher spins after the band crossing",

    "varieties of shapes such as prolate , oblate - triaxial , triaxial2 and triaxial3 shown in the fig .",

    "they have the nearly same moments of inertia and also the similar total routhians , indicating that several different configurations are available at high spins .",
    "for the nucleus @xmath15mo , only a few experimental data are available while it behaves like an oblate band at low spins . at the rotational frequency of @xmath77 mev , a shape transition from oblate to triaxial deformation is predicted and it will keep stable up to 24@xmath71 .",
    "in conclusion , the nuclei with mass number around 80 , i.e. , @xmath2sr , @xmath1zr and @xmath3mo have been calculated by the trs model . due to the large gaps at the prolate deformation @xmath9 with the particle number 38 or 40 and gaps at oblate deformation @xmath10 with the particle number 34 or 36 , shape coexistences are prominent in this region .",
    "spherical , prolate , oblate and triaxial deformations coexist .",
    "mostly , prolate and oblate deformations coexist at low spins while the energy difference between the two shapes deviates largely . for the nuclei @xmath44sr and @xmath78zr ,",
    "the routhians of the prolate deformations are lower than the oblate ones by more than 1 mev , while for the nuclei @xmath4sr and @xmath5zr , the energy differences between the two deformations are less than 220 kev .    at high spins , due to the alignments of a pair of @xmath6 protons and a pair of @xmath6 neutrons , triaxial deformations develop .",
    "both @xmath5zr and @xmath15zr show stable triaxial deformations after the alignments . the triaxially deformed shape for @xmath4zr is predicated to develop at high spins .",
    "the neighboring nuclei @xmath2sr and @xmath3mo also show triaxiality at high spins .",
