    "the radial location of the radio emission regions in pulsar magnetospheres was discussed by several authors . using various methods reviewed by cordes ( 1992 , 1993 ) , constraints on the emission radii",
    "were obtained in a number of papers .",
    "these estimates show that the pulsar emission region is relatively compact and lies near the surface of the neutron star , apparently closer than about 10 per cent of the light - cylinder radius ( cordes 1978 ; blaskiewicz , cordes & wasserman 1991 ; phillips 1992 ; gil & kijak 1993 ; hoensbroech & xilouris 1997 ; kijak & gil 1997 , 1998 ; kramer et al .",
    "1997 ; gupta , bhat & rao 1999 ) .    assuming",
    "that pulsar is a rotating magnetic dipole we can calculate its characteristic age @xmath0 ( manchester & taylor 1977 ) , which is a good estimate of the true age providing that @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are current and initial spin periods , respectively .",
    "most pulsars are @xmath4 years old , however , one separates young and old objects with characteristic ages @xmath5 about @xmath6 yr and @xmath7 yr , respectively .",
    "it is important to note that , the group of old pulsars contains not only millisecond pulsars , but also pulsars with typical period @xmath8 s ( e.g. psr b1848 + 04 , b1952 + 29 ) as well as recently discovered very old pulsar j2144@xmath93933 with the longest measured preiod 8.5 seconds ( young , manchester , johnston 1999 ) .",
    "it is commonly believed that pulsars form two dinstinct populations : high - magnetic field objects that are radio pulsars for relatively short times and recycled objects which can be very old .",
    "the millisecond pulsars ( msps ) have different evolutionary history compared to normal pulsars .",
    "they are recycled pulsars , i.e. they acquired their rapid rotation rates ( @xmath10 a few ms ) due to accretion - driven spin - up ( bhattacharya 1996 ) .",
    "consequently , their magnetic dipole field strength at the surface @xmath11 g ( manchester & taylor 1977 ) is relatively low ( @xmath12  g ) , as compared with the whole population of radio pulsars ( @xmath13  g ) .",
    "previously , it was thought that msps also have different characteristics of radio emission from those of normal pulsars .",
    "however , it has been recently argued ( kramer et al .",
    "1998 , 1999 ; gil & sendyk 2000 ) that msps emission properties do not differ from typical pulsars .    ( 1,14 ) ( -10,-1 )    the semi - empirical relationship proposed by kijak & gil ( 1997 ) describe the dependence of emission altitude on pulsar period @xmath2 ( in seconds ) , observing frequency @xmath14 ( in ghz ) and characteristic age @xmath5 ( in @xmath15 yr ) @xmath16 where @xmath17 cm is the neutron star radius .",
    "this was obtained from analysis of emission altitudes for a number of pulsars at two frequencies .",
    "emission altitudes were estimated using the pulse width method ( see section  2 ) based on a number of straightforward assumptions : ( i ) the pulsar radiation is narrow - band with a radius - to - frequency mapping operating in the emission region , ( ii ) pulsar emission is relativistically beamed tangentially to dipolar magnetic field lines and ( iii ) the extreme profile wings originate at or near the last open field lines .",
    "this , of course , involves an implicit assumption that the magnetic field in the radio emission region is purely dipolar ( see section 3 for discussion ) .",
    "the uncertainties given for various quantities in equation ( 1 ) follow from systematic errors in the pulse width @xmath18 measurements and random errors in estimations of the inclination angle @xmath19 between the rotation and magnetic axes and the impact angle @xmath20 of the closest approach of the observer to the magnetic axis .",
    "first suggestion that radio emission altitudes at a given frequency depend on the pulsar period ( @xmath21 ) was published by gil & kijak ( 1993 ) .",
    "this period dependence was further carefuly investigated by kijak & gil ( 1997 , 1998 ; hereafter papers i and ii ) and more precise relationship @xmath22 was obtained .",
    "anyway , the emission region is apparently located close to the neutron star in short - period pulsars and further away in longer - period pulsars .",
    "alternatively , the ratio @xmath23 decreases with increasing period ( where @xmath24 is the light cylinder radius ) , what was quantitatively demonstrated in papers i ( fig . 3b ) and ii ( fig . 4a and 4b ) .",
    "the equation  ( 1 ) describes also a radius - to - frequency mapping ( rfm ) @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 ) , which means that different frequencies are generated at different altitudes above the magnetic polar cap .",
    "the rfm models of pulsar emission region provide an attractive explanation of why profile widths ( usually ) increase with decreasing frequency .",
    "kijak & gil ( 1998 ) studied the concept of rfm using the multifrequency data of low - intensity pulse widths for normal and millisecond pulsars .",
    "they obtained rfm with the average exponent @xmath27 ( for 16 pulsars ) , consistent with previous estimates using different methods ( see table  4 in paper ii ) .",
    "they ultimately confirmed that the emission altitude depends on frequency @xmath14 , pulsar period @xmath2 as well as on the pulsar age @xmath5 , although the latter dependence was weak . in this paper",
    "we investigate a putative weak dependence of emission altitudes on the characteristic age indicated in earlier work ( equation  1 ) , by selecting a sample of very young and very old radio pulsars and applying to them the same analysis methods as used in papers i and ii .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     finally , let us discuss a possibility that the magnetic field lines in the emission region are not purely dipolar .",
    "the observational opening angle @xmath28 is calculated using geometrical equation proposed by gil , gronkowski & rudnicki ( 1984 ) , which holds on the pulsar centered celestial sphere , independently of geometry of magnetic field lines in the emission region .",
    "this observationally inferred opening angle @xmath29 is also the angle between magnetic axis and the tangent to magnetic field lines at points where the emission correspondig to the apparent pulse width @xmath18 originates . for dipolar field lines @xmath30",
    "is described by equation  ( 2 ) , with @xmath31 for last open field lines corresponding to low level emission below 1% of the maximum intensity ( e.g. table  1 ) . for a simple model of star - centered quadrupole field in the radio emission region , the opening angles @xmath32 deg ( where @xmath33 ) , as compared with @xmath34 deg for dipolar geometry . assuming that @xmath35 we get @xmath36 , where @xmath37 and @xmath38 represent the emission altitudes for dipole and quadrupole field lines , respectively .",
    "thus , if one allows nondipolar magnetic field in the emission region , then equation  ( 1 ) represents the upper limit for emission altitudes .",
    "moreover , the radius - to - frequency mapping would change from @xmath39 for dipolar field to @xmath40 for quadrupole field , where the index @xmath41 is constrained observationaly as @xmath42 ( see table  4 in paper ii ) .",
    "unfortunately , this constraint is too weak to differentiate between dipole and quadrupole field lines .",
    "theoretically , a deviations from dipolar form can be caused by ( i ) outflow of relativistic currents , ( ii ) field lines sweep - back due to fast rotation , and ( iii ) currents flowing in the thin layer of the neutron stars outer crust .",
    "let us briefly discuss these three cases :    \\(i ) the outflow of the charged component of the magnetospheric plasma can not change a structure of strong magnetic field generated inside the neutron star .",
    "in fact , using the ampere s law @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is the toroidal component generated by the maximum available poloidal current through the polar cap @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the emission altitude , @xmath47 cm is the polar cap radius , @xmath48 is the goldreich - julian ( 1969 ) corotational charge density , @xmath49 is the speed of light , @xmath50 is a poloidal ( dipolar ) pulsar magnetic field and @xmath2 is the pulsar period .",
    "one can easily show that @xmath51 .",
    "thus , for typical pulsar @xmath52 is absolutely negligible , while for the millisecond pulsars the toroidal contribution to dipolar magnetic field can achieve a few percent at most .",
    "\\(ii ) the sweep - back of field lines by corotation with neutron star can occur near the light cylinder , where the corotation velocity approaches the speed of light .",
    "however , it is generally accepted that the radio emission originates at altitudes much smaller than the light cylinder radius ( cordes 1978 , bcw , kramer et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) the currents in the crust are most probably sources of multipolar components of the pulsar magnetic field outside the neutron star . however , these contributions decay rapidly with increasing distance from the star surface , and at radio emission altitudes only dipolar field can be expected , at least in normal pulsars . in the millisecond pulsars , in which the emission region can be as close as few stellar radii from the polar cap , the magnetic field lines can , in principle , deviate significantly from dipolar form .",
    "however , arons ( 1993 ) has shown that the location of the spin - up line in the @xmath53 diagram constrains the surface strength of multipole components to no more than 40% of the dipole field in millisecond pulsars .",
    "the main conclusions from this paper and from previous work ( papers i and ii ) on emission regions in radio pulsars are following :    \\(1 ) a radius - to - frequency mapping operates in the emission region and has a form of @xmath54 .",
    "\\(2 ) pulsar radio emission is typically generated at altitudes smaller than a few per cent of the light - cylinder radius @xmath24 and the ratio @xmath23 decreases with increasing period .",
    "the total extent of the emission region is smaller than @xmath55 in longer - period pulsars and correspondingly less in shorter - period pulsars .",
    "\\(3 ) the emission region in old pulsars is located at correspondingly lower altitudes than in young pulsars with approximately the same period .",
    "in summary , pulsar emission altitudes depend on frequency @xmath14 , pulsar period @xmath2 and pulsar age @xmath5 , as described by equation  ( 1 ) .",
