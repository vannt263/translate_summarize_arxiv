    "few technology is employed in the real world to detect land mines because of high false alarm rate [ 1 ] . since mine detection requires low false alarm rate , improving the precision of detection system",
    "should be studied .",
    "many research works have been reported in the control of false alarm rate .",
    "angular correlation function [ 2 ] and a statistical approach method [ 3 ] are employed to detect buried objects .",
    "traditional method of detecting buried objects is to analysis the reflection echo amplitude , which is a analog signal detecting method and difficult in identifying the existence of several reflection echo in the lossy medium .",
    "a novel digital method detecting predesignated reflection echo frequency is presented to detect buried objects .",
    "with the development of finite time difference domain ( fdtd ) theory , it has been used to study time domain near - field measurement .",
    "fdtd as a numerical method to solve maxwell s equations was introduced by yee in 1966 [ 4 ] , which divided both space and time into discrete grids .",
    "the electromagnetic parameters can be figured out in combination with the boundary conditions .",

    "a periodic microwave pulse has particular characters such as high peak value and low average value in near field , so it is difficult to detect the buried objects using amplitude detecting in the lossy medium .",
    "therefor , to measure high peak value rapidly is the key point for mine detection system .",
    "we use microwave frequency detector and high - speed sampling technology in receiver to realize the high efficiency detection .",
    "the component of detection system is shown in figure 1 .",

    "this effect is demonstrated in figure 2 .",
    "@xmath16@xmath17 is the microwave pulse width and @xmath18 is the period of microwave pulse .",
    "the high - speed sampling is key technology for pulse information during digital signal processing .",
    "high - speed @xmath19/@xmath20 conversion circuit will records high level when the reflection echo of pulse is detected and records low level during other time .",
    "finally , completed digital form time domain waveforms can be shown in the computer .",

    "it is well known that fdtd utilizes the yee cell for calculation at nodes of the finite - difference lattice .",
    "we set 420 grids in the @xmath30-direction and 100 grids in the @xmath31-direction with a grid spacing @xmath32 in the yee cell .",
    "we have chosen a microwave signal source with microwave pulse width @xmath16@xmath17@xmath33@xmath34@xmath35 and pulse period @xmath36 as microwave pulse producer .",
    "a @xmath30-band microtrip antenna is employed to both transmit and receive microwave pulse .",
    "there is a microwave frequency detector to detect the @xmath37 microwave at the receiving end .",
