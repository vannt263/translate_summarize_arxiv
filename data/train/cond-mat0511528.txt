    "the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in the cuprate materials has sparked huge interest in models of strongly correlated electrons in low - dimensional systems , such as the hubbard , @xmath2-@xmath3 and @xmath2-@xmath0 models .",
    "these models are exactly solvable in one dimension , at least in some special cases ; but the two - dimensional models pose a formidable numerical challenge .",
    "the ` minus sign ' problem is a major stumbling block for monte carlo calculations in these fermionic systems ; and the convergence of density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) calculations is slow in two dimensions .",
    "exact finite - lattice calculations are limited to small lattice sizes ; while series expansions have typically only been useful for special cases such as the half - filled limit .    in these circumstances ,",
    "a considerable effort has been invested in the study of ` ladder ' systems consisting of two or more coupled chains of sites .",
    "ladders provide a ` half - way house ' , in some sense , between one and two dimensions ; and they also display some very interesting effects in their own right @xcite .",
    "they display quite different behaviour depending on whether the number of legs is even or odd , as in the haldane effect for the heisenberg ladders @xcite .",
    "furthermore , experimental compounds have been found which form ladders @xcite , such as srcu@xmath4o@xmath5 @xcite , which may allow the theoretical predictions to be tested experimentally .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath3 model is an ` effective hamiltonian ' for the parent hubbard model , valid when the coulomb repulsion is large , but nowadays it is considered as an interesting model in its own right @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath0 model is a variant in which the rotational symmetry is broken , and the spin interactions are ising - like .",
    "the two - leg @xmath2-@xmath3 ladder has been extensively studied , using exact diagonalization @xcite , quantum monte carlo @xcite , the dmrg technique @xcite , a combination of different methods @xcite , or using mean - field or approximate analytic methods @xcite . near half - filling",
    ", the model has been explored using dimer series expansions @xcite .",
    "our object is to study the corresponding two - leg @xmath2-@xmath0 ladder , and compare the results for the two models .",
    "this model has not been studied before , as far as we are aware , but the @xmath2-@xmath0 chain has been discussed by batista and ortiz @xcite , and the @xmath2-@xmath0 model on the square lattice has been treated by several groups @xcite .",
    "our primary tool is the dmrg approach , supplemented with a few series calculations near half - filling .",

    "no spin gap occurs , and the holes repel each other .",
    "the @xmath2-@xmath0 ladder might be expected to show similar behaviour .",
    "the major difference between the models is that quantum spin fluctuations are absent in the @xmath2-@xmath0 model , and the system exhibits long - range antiferromagnetic order for half - filling at @xmath7 , whereas the @xmath2-@xmath3 model does not .",
    "this long - range order will be destroyed at any finite temperature , however , and both models will then display similar long - range antiferromagnetic correlations .",
    "the two models should be very similar in most other aspects .",
    "this expectation is borne out by our numerical results .",
    "the phase diagram for the t-@xmath0 ladder looks very similar to that of the t - j ladder , except that the critical couplings are about twice as large , and the tomonaga - luttinger c1s1 phase extends to somewhat higher electron densities .    in section [ secii ]",
    "we specify the model , and consider its behaviour in various limiting cases . in section [ seciii ] a brief discussion of the dmrg method is given , and in section [ seciv ] our numerical results are presented .",

    "the ground state is doubly degenerate here , with both ` singlet ' and ` triplet ' states with @xmath18 having the same energy , unlike the case of the full @xmath2-@xmath3 ladder .",

    "the model becomes equivalent to a classical , static ising model .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we assume periodic boundary conditions , and an even number of rungs l. the ground state at half - filling is the fully antiferromagnetic state shown in figure [ fig2]a , with @xmath30 . the low - energy spin excitations will consist either of localized flipped spins ( ` magnons ' ) with @xmath31 , as shown in fig .",

    "some results of these calculations will be shown in later sections .",
    "the single hole states illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a are localized states , because there is an energy barrier preventing them from hopping : any hop will disturb the antiferromagnetic alignment of the spins . at higher energy ,",
    "however , there will be states such as that shown in figure [ fig4 ] , with unperturbed energy @xmath38 where the hole is free to hop along the zig - zag path shown without incurring any further penalty in spin interaction energy .",
    "assuming periodic boundary conditions , these states are made up of a hole plus a soliton for l even , or a hole alone for l odd . for finite @xmath37 , they will form a band of itinerant electron states .",
    "the mobility of the electrons in both the chain and the ladder systems is a major point of distinction from the two - dimensional model , where the holes are ` confined ' , i.e. can not move without creating a ` string ' of overturned spins behind them , and paying a penalty in spin interaction energy @xcite .",
    "the states ( 3a ) and ( 4 ) will mix as soon as @xmath2 is turned on , and both configurations should be regarded as hole - soliton bound states .",

    "this picture gives a 1-hole energy @xmath51 where @xmath52 .",
    "shraiman and siggia @xcite estimated @xmath53 and @xmath54 for the @xmath2-@xmath0 model , quite close to the values found numerically by barnes et al @xcite , and white and affleck @xcite .    for a one - dimensional chain ,",
    "no nagaoka phase occurs , but for a ladder the condition is once again met that holes can hop around closed loops , and a nagaoka phase is expected @xcite .",
    "white and affleck @xcite have pointed out that the ferromagnetically aligned spins inside the polaron will orient themselves in the xy plane , rather than along the @xmath55 axis , because this costs an exchange energy of @xmath56 per bond , rather than @xmath57 .",
    "for our ladder model , the ferromagnetic ` polaron ' region will be one - dimensional .",
    "if the polaron region spans l rungs of the ladder , the cost in magnetic energy will be @xmath58 assuming the 1-hole wavefunction to vanish at the edges of the polaron , it will take the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes a hole at rung @xmath61 on leg @xmath62 of the ladder , and @xmath63 is a normalization constant .",

    "the @xmath2-@xmath3 ladder is believed to be in a c1s0 or luther - emery phase , with gapped spin excitations and gapless charge excitations corresponding to bound hole pairs .",
    "several authors @xcite have discussed an effective hamiltonian to describe these bosonic excitations , which would capture the low - energy physics of the model .",

    ", we established that the energies of these states have been resolved with sufficiently high accuracy for our purposes .        in the quarter - filled case , it is necessary to use the finite lattice method @xcite in order to achieve reasonably converged energies .",
    "we use the infinite lattice method to build a ladder to a given size , increasing the system block size by a whole rung at each dmrg step as in fig .",
    "[ infinite_lattice ] .",
    "we then perform a finite lattice sweep at the fixed lattice size , using the previously developed system blocks to improve the accuracy of the calculation .",
    "once a target size has been completed with a finite lattice sweep , the infinite lattice algorithm is resumed to proceed to a larger target lattice size whereupon the sweeping procedure is again employed . this way we obtain accurate finite lattice method results for a number of lattice sizes , e.g. , @xmath106 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 24 , 32 , 64 , 128 , 256 lattice sites .",
    "wherever necessary , the data are extrapolated to the bulk limit @xmath107 by fitting a low - order polynomial in @xmath108 to the finite - lattice data .",

    ", however , the situation is rather different from the @xmath2-@xmath3 model , where the full spin - rotation symmetry applies .",
    "the scenario is illustrated in figure  [ fig8 ] , where we show the complete 1-hole energy spectrum of the @xmath2-@xmath3 and @xmath2-@xmath0 models on a 4-rung cluster .",

    "we see that the predicted bandwidth rises as @xmath110 decreases , as one might expect , until at @xmath136 it reaches a peak , and begins to drop towards zero .",
    "similar behaviour in the region of small @xmath6 has been predicted for the 2d @xmath2-@xmath3 model by martinez and horsch @xcite and liu and manousakis @xcite , and confirmed by series calculations @xcite .",

    "the results are consistent with the string picture of brinkman and rice @xcite , and appear to show a sequence of narrow ` string ' excitation peaks in the spectral function , corresponding to holes bound in a linear potential . the effects are even more marked in the @xmath2-@xmath0 model .     as a function of @xmath110 , estimated from the ising series expansion . ]",
    "it would be very interesting to check the actual behaviour of the bandwidth by means of dmrg estimates , but unfortunately our codes can not distinguish different momentum eigenstates .      in studying 2- and 4-hole states and looking for the phase separation boundary",
