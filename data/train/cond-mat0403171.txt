    "consider two identical rubber balloons , the same one as used at children s parties , filled with air and connected by a hose with a valve . for simplicity , we shall approximate the balloons by spheres .",
    "suppose that the larger balloon , the one that has been inflated more , has radius @xmath0 and contains @xmath1 moles of air , while the smaller one has radius @xmath2 and contains @xmath3 moles of air .",
    "when the valve is opened which balloon is going to grow and which will shrink ?",
    "it seems almost obvious that the larger balloon should shrink , while the smaller one should grow .",
    "this , however , is not what is often found .",
    "for some balloon sizes the air flows from the larger balloon to the smaller one , but for other sizes the direction of the air flow is reversed .",
    "what can explain this seemingly counterintuitive behavior ?",
    "when the valve of the hose connecting the two balloons is opened , the direction of air flow is determined by the two laws of thermodynamics  @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath4 moles of air are transfered from the bigger balloon to the smaller one .",
    "the work needed to accomplish this is determined by the first law of thermodynamics , @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the environment entropy , pressure , and temperature ; @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 are the internal energy , pressure and volume of the gas inside the two balloons @xmath12 ; and @xmath13 is the internal energy of the balloon rubber membranes .",
    "the second law of thermodynamics requires that @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the entropy of gas and of the rubber membrane of balloon @xmath17 .    since the transfer of @xmath18 moles of gas between the two balloons with finite pressure difference is an irreversible process , the total entropy of the universe will increase .",
    "it follows that the work necessary for the transfer is bounded from below by @xmath19 from thermodynamics @xmath20 and @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the volume of rubber , @xmath23 is the surface tension , @xmath24 is the surface area , and @xmath25 is the chemical potential of gas inside the balloon @xmath17 .    as a leading order approximation we can consider rubber to be incompressible ,",

    "( [ 8 ] ) , this conclusion holds for non - ideal gases as well .",
    "although the calculation was performed for spherical balloons , it is evident that the conclusion concerning the direction of air flow , eqs .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) and ( [ 10 ] ) , does not depend on the specific balloon shape . on the other hand ,",
    "if the same balloons are filled with a heavy gas and are placed at different heights in the gravitational field , the flow of air will no longer be governed simply by the difference in internal pressure between the two balloons . nevertheless , while eq .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) will loose its validity , eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) will remain correct , however the chemical potential of gas will have to include a gravitational contribution as well .",
    "as air enters into balloon , its rubber membrane stretches and becomes tense .",
    "the helmholtz free energy of a rubber sheet is @xmath38 if the sheet is subjected to stress @xmath39 , its internal energy @xmath40 will vary in accordance with eq .",
    "( [ 1ac ] ) , and its helmholtz free energy as , @xmath41 the surface tension of the sheet is then , @xmath42 it is an experimental fact  @xcite that up to fairly large extensions the internal energy of a rubber sheet is independent of its area , @xmath43 this equation should be compared to a similar equation for the ideal gas  the internal energy of an ideal gas is independent of the volume that it occupies .",
    "clearly , this is not correct for real gases , but serves as a very good approximation for a gas at low density .",
    "similarly , eq .  [ 11d ] holds only for `` ideal '' rubber .",
