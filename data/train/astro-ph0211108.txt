    "in recent years , both photometric and spectroscopic optical observations of gamma - ray burst ( grb ) afterglows have provided valuable information about the emission from grbs . while spectral lines have been used to determine redshift distances and to study the host galaxies , photometric light curves have unravelled the physical parameters and dynamical evolution of grb afterglows ( cf .",

    "it is unlikely that emission from reverse shock will contribute significantly after @xmath73 day and the steepening in the light curve appears to be 6 days after the burst .",
    "we have therefore determined flux decay constant for the oa using least square linear fit to the data points of @xmath74 day and found values of 0.92@xmath210.08 , 0.93@xmath210.03 and 1.13@xmath210.04 in @xmath6,@xmath1 and @xmath2 passbands respectively .",

    "is expected when the jet makes the transition to sideways expansion after the relativistic lorentz factor drops below the inverse of the opening angle of the initial beam .",
    "as there are rapid variations around overall early time flux decay , we fitted the above function in @xmath36 bands , for @xmath88 2 day to determine the parameters of the jet model . in order to avoid a fairly wide range of model parameters for a comparable @xmath89 due to degeneracy between @xmath90 and @xmath80 , we have used fixed values of @xmath91 and @xmath80 in our analyses and find that the minimum value of @xmath89 is achieved around @xmath92 .",

    "2 the best fit light curves obtained in this way for @xmath36 passbands are shown .",
    "it can also be seen that our own observations follow the fitted curves very well and fill gaps in the published data .    in the light of above , we conclude that the parameters derived from the optical @xmath36 light curves are @xmath940.05 for reverse shock emission and @xmath950.2 day , @xmath960.05 and @xmath970.2 for the oa .",
    "these parameters are improved further in the next section by fitting the multi - wavelength observations with the standard fireball model of grbs .",
    "we attempt modelling the behaviour of grb 021004 oa along the lines of standard grb model proposed by kobayashi & zhang ( 2003 ) .",
    "the 7 - 400  kev gamma - ray fluence ( lamb et al . 2002 ) implies an isotropic - equivalent energy of @xmath98  erg emitted in the burst radiation , for @xmath99  km / s / mpc in a @xmath100 , @xmath101 cosmological model .",
    "the corresponding comoving passband of @xmath102  kev contains the bulk of the emitted energy in most grbs , and a k - corrected estimate of bolometeric energy is unlikely to exceed this by more than @xmath103 ( bloom et al 2001 ) . assuming a similar amount of energy to remain in the fireball to power the afterglow ( piran et al .",
    "2001 ) , one finds that for a typical @xmath104 and @xmath105 ( panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) the frequency @xmath106 of maximum radiation in the afterglow spectrum should lie close to the optical band at @xmath107  day after the burst ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ; kobayashi & zhang 2003 ) .",
    "the brightening of grb 021004 oa optical lightcurve at @xmath107  day , relative to the extrapolated early decay , could therefore be attributed to the passage of @xmath106 through the optical band .",
    "the three early @xmath1-band observations ( fox 2002 ) which show a power - law decay of @xmath940.05 before the brightening can then be understood in terms of a decaying prompt emission from the reverse shock ( kobayashi & zhang 2003 ) .",
    "we exclude this early emission from our further discussion and restrict ourselves to the properties of the forward shock emission .    in fig .",
    "3 we compare the predictions of a standard afterglow model with electron energy distribution power - law index @xmath108=2.27 and a jet - break time @xmath82 of 6.7 days . for this , the observed magnitudes / fluxes have been corrected for standard galactic extinction law given by mathis ( 1990 ) and the effective wavelength and normalization by fukugita et al . (",
    "1995 ) for @xmath109 and by bessell & brett ( 1988 ) for near - ir have been used .",
    "the fluxes thus derived are accurate to about 10% in optical and about 25% in near - ir . for the model parameters mentioned above , relative normalization of the light curves in different optical passbands become consistent with the data if the total extinction is @xmath10  mag , which has been used in our analysis .",
    "the galactic extinction in this direction is estimated to be @xmath110  mag from the smoothed reddening map provided by schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) .",
    "the additional extinction may then be attributed to small scale fluctuations in the distribution of dust in our galaxy , or may , in part , originate even in the host galaxy of the grb . the spectral slope deduced in section  2.2 from the hct low resolution spectrum",
    "is also consistent with @xmath111 once the above total extinction is taken into account .",
    "the flux decay constants derived in the last section are also consistent with the parameters used in the model .    given the above model parameters we find that the broadband behaviour of the oa is well explained .",
    "however , such a model can not reproduce short term variations , as seen during the interval @xmath112  days in the optical light curves ( see fig .",
    "the reason for these short term variations could lie in density variations in the circum - burst medium , as conjectured by lazzati et al . ( 2002 ) and nakar et al .",
    "3 shows the broadband spectrum including @xmath20ray , optical - near ir and radio observations and the model predictions .",
    "the cooling break @xmath113 is located between the optical and @xmath20ray bands .",
    "the spectrum observed within the @xmath20ray band at @xmath114  day ( sako & harrison 2002a ) is @xmath115 , and the decay rate is @xmath116 . both are consistent with @xmath111 and @xmath117 , at a time before the jet break .",
    "our model predictions are also in good agreement with the chandra observation at @xmath118  day ( sako & harrison 2002b ) . the presence of a jet break between the two observations results in the apparent temporal decay slope of @xmath119 reported by sako & harrison ( 2002b ) .    the 1.4  ghz to 8.5  ghz radio spectrum at 5.67  days ( berger et al .",
    "2002 ) is well fit by the model , assuming a self - absorption frequency @xmath120 near 2  ghz .",
    "the same assumptions lead to a good explanation of the cm - wave radio light curve .",
    "3 shows the derived light curve at 10  ghz from measurements reported at nearby frequencies ( frail & berger 2002 , pooley et al .",
    "2002 , berger et al . 2002 ) and the model prediction . however , this model is unable to reproduce the 85  ghz flux of 2.5  mjy observed at @xmath69 = 1.45  days ( bremer & castro - tirado 2002 ) .",
    "although at the maximum of the spectrum ( @xmath106 ) the flux rises to 2.75  mjy in the model , at @xmath69 = 1.45 days , @xmath106 is located well above 85  ghz and the predicted flux is only @xmath121  mjy at 85  ghz . it may well be that a part of the emission observed at 85  ghz comes from the host galaxy as in the case of grb  010222 ( frail et al . 2002 ) which should be seen to remain visible after the afterglow fades away .",
    "we present the broad band @xmath36 photometric and low - resolution spectroscopic optical observations of the oa associated with grb 021004 starting about 3 hour after the burst .",
    "our last photometric observations are at about @xmath69 = 12 days .",
    "these observations in combination with the published multi - wavelength data have been used to study the flux decay and to derive parameters of the grb and its afterglow .",
    "we have used secure photometric calibrations in the present analyses .",
    "the optical observations obtained by fox ( 2002 ) during the first 20 minutes of the burst indicate that grb 021004 is the second grb oa after grb 990123 from which optical emission from the reverse shock has been observed ( galama et al .",
    "the dense temporal @xmath36 passband light curve indicates rapid light variations .",
    "such flux variations from a power - law decay have been reported only for grb 000301c ( sagar et al .",
    "2000a , masetti et al .",
    "2000 , jensen et al .",
    "2001 , garnavich , loab & stanek 2000 , gaudi et al . 2001 ) and for grb 011211 ( holland et al .",
    "2002 , jakobsson et al .",
    "2003 ) so far . however , the amplitude of oscillation is maximum in the case of grb 021004 oa being @xmath122  mag .",
    "the light curves show a steepening superposed on the achromatic , rapid variations which could be detected mainly due to the dense observations in @xmath36 filters .",
    "this indicates that in future the small telescopes , as large amount of observing time is available on them ( cf .",
    "sagar 2000 ) , will play an important role in understanding the origin of such short term variability in the light curves of grbs during early times .",
    "the overall flux decay in observed light curves is well understood in terms of a jet model .",
    "the flux decay constants at early and late times derived from least square fits to the light curves are 0.99@xmath210.05 and 2.0@xmath210.2 respectively .",
    "the value of the jet break time is about 7 day .",
    "the total extinction in the direction of the oa is @xmath123 mag .",
    "the low - resolution spectrum corrected for this extinction yields a spectral slope of @xmath1240.02 .",
    "the photometric colour distributions determined in optical and near - ir regions for various epochs indicate that spectral index of the grb 021004 afterglow has not changed significantly during a period of about 15 days after the burst , while the flux decay slope has steepened from 1.0 to 2.0 .",
    "grb 021004 thus becomes one more burst for which a clear achromatic break in the light curve is observed .",
    "this is generally accepted as an evidence for collimation of the relativistic grb ejecta in accordance with the prediction by recent theoretical models ( mszros & rees 1999 ; rhoads 1999 ; sari piran & halpern 1999 ) .",
    "recent afterglow observations of grbs show that a relativistic blast wave , in which the highly relativistic electrons radiate via synchrotron mechanism , provides a generally good description of the observed properties . in the case of grb",
    "021004 oa also , it appears that a standard fireball afterglow model , with a combination of emission from a forward and a reverse shock can account for most of the overall behaviour of the afterglow .",
    "the observed fluxes , however , show unexplained fluctuations , falling significantly below model predictions in the range @xmath125 = 0.52  days .",
    "density variations in the circum - burst medium is one possible explanation of this behaviour ( wang & loeb 2000 , lazzati et al .",
    "2002 , nakar et al . 2003 , heyl and perna 2003 ) . while an alternative explanation in terms of micro - lensing ( garnavich , loeb & stanek 2000 ) can not be entirely ruled out",
    ", the multiple bumps seen in this light curve would not be natural in this model .",
    "the observed jet break time of @xmath126  day , along with the burst fluence , leads to an estimate of the jet opening angle of @xmath127 ( for an assumed @xmath4ray efficiency @xmath128 ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ) , and a circumburst density @xmath129  @xmath130 inferred from reverse - shock modelling by kobayashi & zhang ( 2003 ) , similar to the opening angles inferred in other jetted afterglows ( see , e.g.  panaitescu & kumar 2001 ) .",
    "the inferred opening angle implies a total emitted gamma - ray energy of @xmath131 erg , close to the peak of the @xmath132 distribution in grbs as shown by frail et al .",
    "the modelling of the radio emission suggests that excess emission might have been detected at 85  ghz , possibly due to the emission from the host galaxy .",
    "if this turns out to be true , then the observed emission would indicate a strong star formation activity in the host galaxy .",
    "the multiple blue shifted h , c - iv and si - iv absorption lines in the spectrum of grb021004 oa , with a velocity span of 3200 km / s , could be interpreted as a clumpy wc star wind environment ( mirabal et al .",
    "however our modelling indicates that the light curve after @xmath107  day is better explained by a circumburst medium of nearly uniform density with small scale density variations rather than a @xmath133 wind density profile .",
    "this might imply a variable mass loss rate in the wind ( heyl and perna 2003 ) or that the circumburst medium is composed not of wolf - rayet wind but of expanding ejecta of a supernova preceding the burst ( salamanca et al 2002 , wang et al 2003 ) . in either case",
    ", these observations provide a strong support in favour of collapsar origin of this burst in particular , and of long duration grbs in general .",
    "the peculiarity in the light curves of grb 021004 could be noticed mainly due to dense as well as multi - wavelength observations during early times .",
    "such observations of recent grbs have started revealing features which require explanation other than generally accepted so far indicating that there may be yet new surprises in grb afterglows .",
    "we thank an anonymous referee for comments which helped us improve the paper . this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
