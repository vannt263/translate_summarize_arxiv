    "the analytic classification of irregular equations ( 1.1 ) is well - known ( [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 16 ] ) : the complete system of invariants for analytic classification consists of a formal normal form ( 1.4 ) and stokes operators ( 1.6 ) defined in 1.2 ; the latters are linear operators acting in the solution space of ( 1.1 ) comparing appropriate `` sectorial canonical solution bases '' .    on the other hand , an irregular equation ( 1.1 )",
    "can be regarded as a result of _ confluence of fuchsian singular points _",
    "( recall that a fuchsian singular point of a linear equation is a first order pole of its right - hand side ) .",
    "namely , consider a deformation @xmath9 of equation ( 1.1 ) that splits the irregular singular point 0 of the nonperturbed equation into @xmath10 fuchsian singularities @xmath11 of the perturbed equation , i.e. , @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "the family ( 1.2 ) depends on a parameter @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the _ monodromy group _ of a fuchsian equation acts linearly in its solution space by analytic extensions of solutions along closed loops . the analytic equivalence class of a generic fuchsian equation is completely determined by the local types of its singularities and the action of its monodromy group .    everywhere below by @xmath17",
    "we denote the monodromy operator of the perturbed equation ( 1.2 ) along a loop going around the singular point @xmath18 ( the choice of the corresponding loops will be specified later ) .",
    "the monodromy group of the perturbed equation is generated by appropriately chosen operators @xmath17 .    in 1984",
    "v.i.arnold proposed the following question .",
    "consider a generic deformation ( 1.2 ) .",
    "is there an operator @xmath19 from the monodromy group of the perturbed equation that converges to a stokes operator of the nonperturbed equation ?",
    "a version of this question was proposed independently by j .-",
    "p.ramis in 1988 .",
    "it appears that already in the simplest case of dimension 2 and poincar rank @xmath20 generically _ each operator from the monodromy group ( except for that along a circuit ( and its powers ) around both singularities ) tends to infinity _ ( theorem 4.6 in section 4 ) , so , no one tends to a stokes operator .",
    "in other terms , generically , no word ( 1.3 ) with @xmath21 tends to a stokes operator .",
    "but if @xmath20 , then appropriate words ( 1.3 ) with _ noninteger _ exponents @xmath22 tend to stokes operators ( theorem 2.16 in 2.2 )",

    "p.ramis , b.khesin , a.duval , c.zhang , j.martinet , the author and others ( see the historical overview in 1.3 ) .",
    "it was proved by the author in [ 6 ] that appropriate branches of the eigenfunctions of the monodromy operators @xmath17 of the perturbed equation tend to appropriate canonical solutions of the nonperturbed equation ( theorem 2.5 in 2.1 ) . in the case of poincar rank @xmath20",
    "this implies ( corollary 2.6 in 2.1 ) that stokes operators of the nonperturbed equation are limits of transition operators between appropriate eigenbases of the monodromy operators @xmath17 .",
    "this corollary has a generalization for higher poincar rank [ 6 ] .",
    "the proofs of the results of the present paper are based on the previously mentioned results from [ 6 ] , which are recalled in 2.1 .    in 1.2 we recall the analytic classification of irregular equations ( 1.1 ) and the definitions of sectorial canonical solution bases and stokes operators .    in 2.2 we state theorem 2.16 on convergence of appropriate word ( 1.3 ) with noninteger exponents",
    "@xmath22 to a stokes operator in the case of poincar rank @xmath20 .",
    "its proof is given in section 3 .",
    "the corresponding exponents @xmath22 do not depend on the choice of deformation .",
    "in fact , in the case of the higher poincar rank @xmath23 and @xmath24 one can also prove a similar statement , but now the choice of the corresponding exponents @xmath22 will depend on the choice of deformation",
    ". the latter case will be discussed in 2.3 .    in section 4 in the case , when @xmath20 , @xmath24 , for a typical nonperturbed equation ( 1.1 ) we prove the divergence of the operators from the monodromy group of the perturbed equation ( except for the monodromy along a circuit around both singularities and its powers ) .",

    "one can ask the question : is it true that the variables @xmath26 in the equation can be separated , more precisely , that ( 1.1 ) is analytically equivalent to a direct sum of one - dimensional linear equations , i.e. , a linear equation with a diagonal matrix function in the right - hand side ?",
    "generically , the answer is `` no '' . at the same time",
    "any irregular equation ( 1.1 ) is formally equivalent to a unique direct sum of the type @xmath27 where @xmath28 are polynomials of degrees at most @xmath2 , @xmath29 .",
    "the normalizing series bringing ( 1.1 ) to ( 1.4 ) is unique up to left multiplication by constant diagonal matrix .",

    "@xmath47- good _ , if for any pair @xmath48 , @xmath49 , it contains exactly one corresponding imaginary dividing ray and so does its closure .    in the case , when @xmath20 , @xmath24 , @xmath39 , the imaginary dividing rays are the imaginary semiaxes , and the notions of good sector and @xmath47- good sector coincide .",
    "the ratio @xmath50 of solutions of equations from ( 1.4 ) tends to either zero or infinity , as @xmath32 tends to zero along a ray distinct from the imaginary dividing rays corresponding to the pair @xmath48 .",
    "its limit changes exactly when the ray under consideration jumps over one of the latter imaginary dividing rays .",
    "we consider a covering @xmath31 of a punctured neighborhood of zero by good ( or @xmath47- good ) sectors numerated counterclockwise and put @xmath51 .",
    "the standard splitting of the normal form ( 1.4 ) into the direct sum of one - dimensional equations defines a canonical base in its solutions space ( uniquely up to multiplication of the base functions by constants ) with a diagonal fundamental matrix .",
    "denote the latter fundamental matrix by @xmath52 together with the normalizing changes @xmath53 in @xmath33 , it defines the canonical bases @xmath54 in the solution space of ( 1.1 ) in the sectors @xmath33 with the fundamental matrices @xmath55 where for any @xmath56 the branch ( `` with the index @xmath57 '' ) of the fundamental matrix @xmath58 in @xmath59 is obtained from that in @xmath33 by the counterclockwise analytic extension for any @xmath56 .",

    "generically , they do not coincide .",
    "the transition between them is defined by a constant matrix @xmath63 : @xmath64 the  transition  operators ( matrices @xmath63 ) are called _ stokes operators ( matrices ) _ ( see [ 2 ] , [ 3 ] , [ 9 ] , [ 10 ] , [ 16 ] ) .",
    "the nontriviality of stokes operators yields the obstruction to analytic equivalence of ( 1.1 ) and its formal normal form ( 1.4 ) .",
    "stokes matrices ( 1.6 ) are well - defined up to simultaneous conjugation by one and the same diagonal matrix .",
    "let @xmath65 . in this case",
    "without loss of generality we assume that @xmath66 ( one can achieve this by linear change of the time variable ) .",
    "then the above covering consists of two sectors @xmath67 and @xmath68 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the former contains the positive imaginary semiaxis and its closure does not contain the negative one ; the latter has the same properties with respect to the negative ( respectively , positive ) imaginary semiaxis .",
    "there are two components of the intersection @xmath69 .",
    "so , in this case we have a pair of stokes operators . _",
    "the stokes matrices ( 1.6 ) are unipotent : _ the one corresponding to the left intersection component is lower - triangular ; the other one is upper - triangular ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "stokes operators of an irregular equation ( 1.1 ) with a diagonal matrix in the right - hand side are identity operators . in this case",

    "the previous remark .",
    "thus , formal normal form and stokes matrix tuple taken up to the previous conjugation present the complete system of invariants for analytic classification of irregular equations ( see @xmath30 ) .      earlier in 1919 r. garnier [ 5 ] had studied some particular deformations of some class of linear equations with nonresonant irregular singularity . he obtained some analytic classification invariants for these equations by studying their deformations .",
    "the complete system of analytic classification invariants ( stokes operators and formal normal form ) for general irregular differential equations was obtained later in 1970-th years in the papers by jurkat , lutz , peyerimhoff [ 10 ] , sibuya [ 16 ] and balser , jurkat , lutz [ 3 ] .",
    "later jurkat , lutz and peyerimhoff had extended their results to some resonant cases [ 11 ] .",

    "he considered the classical confluenting family of hypergeometric equations and proved convergence of appropriate branches of monodromy eigenfunctions of the perturbed equation to canonical solutions of the nonperturbed one by direct calculation [ 15 ] . in the late 1980-th years b.khesin also proved a version of this statement , but his result was not published . in 1991 a.duval",
    "[ 4 ] proved this statement for the biconfluenting family of hypergeometric equations ( where the nonperturbed equation is equivalent to bessel equation ) by direct calculation . in 1994 c. zhang",
    "[ 17 ] had obtained the expression of garnier s invariants via stokes operators ( for the class of irregular equations considered by garnier ) .    the conjecture saying that stokes operators are limit transition operators between monodromy eigenbases of the perturbed equation was firstly proposed by a.a.bolibrukh in 1996 .",
