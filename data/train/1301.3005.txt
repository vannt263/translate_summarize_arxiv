    "the _ transit method _ is not only an excellent technique to detect extrasolar planets , but also provide unrivalled access to their physical parameters .",
    "the geometry of a transiting extrasolar planet ( tep ) system permits measurement of the mass , radius and density of a planet .",
    "these quantities require some input from stellar evolutionary theory , but the planetary surface gravity can be measured directly .",
    "a tep system is therefore a potential _ horn of plenty _ of physical information on planetary systems @xcite .",
    "currently , most of the teps discovered by ground - based transit surveys ( e.g.  @xcite ) are close - in hot jupiters , because the detection probability for such planets is much greater than for those which are smaller or on wider orbits .",
    "hot jupiters are also relatively straightforward to detect via the _ radial velocity method _ , as they induce comparatively large velocity variations in their host stars .",
    "the existence of hot jupiters was unexpected @xcite , and led to the birth of new formation and migration theories ( see the reviews of @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "the bias of the ground - based surveys in favour of this class of planets is clear , whereas the _ kepler _ satellite has already found hundreds of smaller and longer - period planet candidates from only 16 months of data @xcite .",
    "another fascinating opportunity offered by teps is the possibility to probe their atmospheres . due to atomic and molecular absorption ,",
    "the analysis of the spectrum of the parent stars during transit ( primary eclipse ) is an excellent way to probe their atmospheric composition .",
    "the existence of two different classes of hot jupiters ( pm and pl ) has been suggested according to the incident stellar flux received from the parent star and to the expected amount of absorbing substances , such as gaseous titanium oxide ( tio ) and vanadium oxide ( vo ) , in their atmospheres @xcite . according to theoretical models",
    ", these two oxidized elements should be extremely strong absorbers for the pm class between 450 nm and 700 nm , causing such planets to have a hot ( @xmath11@xmath12 k ) stratosphere .",
    "an observable variation of radius with wavelength , due to the opacities of these elements , is consequently expected in the optical bands @xcite .",
    "the radius of a pm planet should be @xmath13 lower at @xmath14@xmath15 nm versus @xmath16@xmath17 nm . the radius variations for the colder pl - class planets ( incident flux @xmath18@xmath19ergs@xmath20@xmath21 ) are smaller , but a significant contribution to the opacity in the optical band is expected from na at @xmath11@xmath22 nm , and k at @xmath11@xmath23 nm @xcite .",
    "transmission spectroscopy is essential for detecting atmospheric absorbers , and is complementary to observations at secondary eclipse which can help to determine the day - side atmospheric temperature structure .",
    "accurate measurements of planet radii provide critical constraints for astrophysicists working on planet formation and evolution , because they provide an indication of the planet internal heat , structure and composition , as well as the heating mechanism for those which undergo strong tidal effects and stellar irradiation , allowing the discrimination between competing theories @xcite .",
    "in particular , the most irradiated hot jupiters are characterised by anomalously inflated radii for which the explanation remains unclear @xcite .",
    "photometric and spectroscopic analyses of planet atmospheres started with the use of optical , near - infrared ( nir ) and infrared ( ir ) instruments aboard the _ hubble _ and _ spitzer _ space telescopes @xcite and led to the detection of rayleigh scattering in a few hot jupiter atmospheres , plus absorption lines associated with h@xmath24o , na , ch@xmath25 , tio and vo ( see above references but also @xcite ) .",
    "after a number of pioneering experiments with null results , ground - based spectroscopy also obtained some interesting results .",
    "observations performed at the hobby - eberly and subaru telescopes , in the spectral range @xmath16@xmath26 nm , detected na absorption in the transmission spectrum of hd189733b @xcite and hd209458b @xcite .",
    "nir spectroscopy of hd209458b at the vlt in the range @xmath27@xmath28 nm reported a significant wavelength shift in absorption lines from carbon monoxide in the planet s atmosphere @xcite .",
    "high - resolution nir spectroscopic measurements at the keck telescopes over the wavelength range @xmath29@xmath30 nm , revealed an upper limit for co absorption in the atmosphere of hd209458b @xcite , and that the super - earth gj1214b is a h - dominated planet @xcite .",
    "gj1214b was also studied through multi - object spectroscopy from 0.61 to 0.85 @xmath31 m , and in the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 atmospheric windows by using vlt / fors and magellan / mmirs , the data being consistent with a featureless transmission spectrum for the planet @xcite .",
    "a radius variation with wavelength was investigated for hd209458b by @xcite using ten - colour hst photometry .",
    "different analyses of these data have given conflicting results @xcite .",
    "an hst transmission spectrum of hd189733b covering 270570 nm showed a gradual increase of radius towards shorter wavelengths which was interpreted as a result of rayleigh scattering from a high - altitude atmospheric haze @xcite .",
    "but observations covering 5501050 nm did not provide any indication of the expected na or k features @xcite , and those in the ranges @xmath35@xmath36 nm and @xmath37@xmath38 nm did not detect any variation in planetary radius @xcite .    using the gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) , @xcite claimed the first evidence for potassium in an extrasolar planet , from photometry of the xo-2 system in four narrow red - optical passbands , by detecting k absorption at 766.5 nm .",
    "this technique was also used by @xcite to study hd80606b , who found an unexplained large ( @xmath39 ) change in the apparent planetary radius between the wavelengths 769.9 and 777.4 nm .",
    "the differential spectrophotometry technique was used to obtain two transit light curves of xo-2b with gtc by @xcite , who detected significant absorption in the planetary atmosphere in a 50-  bandpass centred on the na doublet . instead , the presence of an na - rich atmosphere in wasp-29b was recently ruled out by @xcite , using gemini - south gmos transit spectrophotometry .",
    "@xcite recently presented a study of possible radius variations of the hot jupiter hat - p-5b , based on photometry obtained simultaneous in the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath6 and @xmath42 passbands .",
    "the authors detected a gradual increase of the radius between @xmath43 nm and @xmath44 nm , plus a substantially larger planetary radius at @xmath14 nm . the latter phenomenon can be explained by systematic errors in the @xmath40-band photometry , but is also consistent with rayleigh scattering as in the case of hd189733b .",
    "a similar multi - band investigation of hat - p-8 @xcite suggests the presence of strong optical absorbers near the terminator of this tep .",
    "here we focus our attention on the planetary system wasp-44 , discovered by @xcite .",
    "the system consists of a 0.89@xmath45 planet on a @xmath46-day orbit around an inactive g8v star ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 } = + 0.06 $ ] ) . in this work",
    "we present the first photometric follow - up since its discovery was announced , covering seven optical / nir passbands .",
    "we refine the physical properties of the system and attempt to probe for radius variations in these passbands .",
    "our paper is structured as follows . in   [ sec_2 ]",
    "we describe the instruments used for the observations and give some details concerning the data reduction . in   [ sec_3 ]",
    "we illustrate the analysis of the data which led to the refinement of the orbital period and the physical properties of the wasp-44 system .",
    "then , we examine the variation of the planetary radius with wavelength . finally , in   [ sec_4 ] we summarise our results .",
    "two transits of wasp-44b were recorded on 2011 october 2 and 6 , using the * * g**amma * * r**ay burst * * o**ptical and * * n**ear - infrared * * d**etector ( grond ) instrument mounted on the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope at eso la silla , chile .",
    "grond is an imaging system capable of simultaneous photometric observations in four optical ( identical to sloan @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 ) and three nir ( @xmath4 ) passbands @xcite .",
    "each of the four optical channels is equipped with a back - illuminated @xmath49 e2v ccd , with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath50 at a scale of @xmath51 .",
    "the three nir channels use @xmath52 rockwell hawaii-1 arrays with a fov of @xmath53 at @xmath54 .",
    "we applied a slight telescope defocus and obtained repeated integrations during both runs .",
    "autoguiding was used to keep the stars on the same pixels .",
    "all images were digitised using the fast read - out mode ( @xmath11@xmath55s ) to improve the time sampling .",
    "on 2011/10/02 we monitored the flux of wasp-44 in nearly photometric conditions , and saw a monotonical seeing decline from @xmath56 to @xmath57 as airmass decreased from 1.08 to 1.05 and then rose to 1.54 .",
    "exposures of 20s were used in the optical channels and stacks of four 4s images were obtained in the nir channels .",
    "on 2011/10/06 we experienced worse atmospheric conditions , and the airmass changed from 2.07 to 1.05 during our observations . images with exposure times of 25s were obtained in the optical channels , and stacks of six 4s images in the nir channels . for the optical frames we selected a fast read - out mode , which provided a 15s readout . due to the necessary synchronization of the optical and nir starting times for each exposure ,",
    "the observing cadence resulted to be of @xmath58 and @xmath59s in the optical and nir bands respectively .",
    "another full transit of wasp-44b was observed through a gunn @xmath6 filter on the night of 2011/09/02 using the wide field camera ( wfc ) on the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) at la palma .",
    "wfc is an optical mosaic camera consisting of four thinned eev 2k@xmath604k ccds , with a plate scale of @xmath61pixel@xmath20 .",
    "the telescope was heavily defocussed so the point spread function ( psf ) of the target and comparison stars had not more than @xmath62 counts per pixel .",
    "we used the fast readout mode to reduce readout time down to about @xmath63s .",
    "an exposure time of @xmath64min per frame was used , and the resulting observing cadence was roughly @xmath7s .",
    "the night was photometric .",
    "we were not able to autoguide the telescope as the autoguider is incorporated into the wfc and so was also defocussed .",
    "a summary of the observational data is reported in table[tab_1 ] .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as an additional possibility for the grond data , we made an attempt to investigate the possible variation of the radius of wasp-44b with wavelength .",
    "this is quite a difficult task because the relative faintness of the host star ( @xmath65 ) makes this system less than ideal for optical photometric studies , especially from the ground .",
    "moreover , as already mentioned , our _ in - focus _ observing strategy has proved to be ill - suited to obtaining high - precision photometry , particularly in the nir bands .",
    "finally , by using broad - band filters we are forced to average our measurements of the planet radius in each band over a quite larger range of the wavelength ( the best case in the @xmath2 filter where its width is `` only '' 100 nm ) .",
    "for these reasons , the results of this section should be used with care .",
    "the grond instrument was conceived only for the follow - up of gamma - ray bursts , and was not designed to allow filter changes for individual observing sequences .",
    "we were therefore unable to use filters with narrow passbands covering specific wavelength ranges .",
    "we note that the four optical bands of grond were already used by @xcite to investigate the atmosphere of gj1214b , a 6.55m@xmath66 transiting planet . here",
    "we try for the first time to use all the seven bands , exploiting the full potential of grond .    following the same strategy used by @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we proceeded as follows .",
    "the two grond datasets were combined by phase and according to passband , and then fitted with all parameters fixed to the final values given in table[tab_4 ] , with the exception of @xmath67 .",
    "the ld coefficients were fixed to theoretical values .",
    "the errors were estimated by a residual - permutation algorithm @xcite .",
    "this approach removes sources of uncertainty common to all datasets , allowing us to maximise the accuracy of estimations of the fractional planetary radius @xmath68 as a function of wavelength and with relative errorbars only .",
    "the results are displayed in fig.[fig_5 ] , where the points show the data , the vertical bars represent the relative errors in the measurements and the horizontal bars indicate the full widths at half maximum transmission of the passbands used .",
    "the trasmission curves are also reported for completeness . as expected ,",
    "the uncertainties in the nir bands are larger , due to the larger scatter and systematic features in the light curves .",
    "inspection of fig.[fig_5 ] shows that our measurements are unfortunately not sufficiently accurate to claim a clear variation of @xmath69 along the seven passbands . using the planetary system values reported in table[tab_6 ] , we computed a one - dimensional model atmosphere of wasp-44b , using the atmosphere code described in @xcite .",
    "the fully non - gray model uses the chemical equilibrium abundances of @xcite and the opacity database described in @xcite .",
    "the atmospheric pressure - temperature profile simulates planet - wide average conditions .",
    "we furthermore computed the transmission spectrum of the model using the methods described in @xcite .    at optical wavelengths",
    ", @xmath69 appears to be slightly larger in @xmath70 and @xmath71 than @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "this is as expected for a planet with an equilibrium temperature @xmath74k , due to the larger predicted radius around the na and k lines .",
    "although a similar effect is seen in the model ( figure[fig_6 ] ) , our data are not sufficiently precise to reject the default hypothesis that @xmath69 is constant with wavelength .",
    "the radius of wasp-44b is in agreement with the theoretical model in the @xmath32 band , but is larger in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 bands .",
    "we found that the @xmath75 in @xmath70 is @xmath76 and @xmath77 smaller than that for the @xmath33 and @xmath34 band respectively , which correspond to a difference in units of atmospheric pressure scale height ( @xmath33 ) of roughly 23@xmath33 and 10@xmath33 , respectively .",
    "the first difference is very large , and would involve an extreme opacity in @xmath33 .",
    "a more plausible alternative is that the nir photometry is affected by systematics or correlated noise , which was not possible to eliminate .",
    "this is also suggested by the poor snr observed in the data , which is reflected in the higher scatter of the points in the @xmath78 light curves and the different shapes of the fit in the same band between the first and the second observed transits ( figs .",
    "[ fig_2 ] and [ fig_3 ] ) .",
    "we deduce that systematic errors in the nir dominate the error budget at these wavelengths .",
    "in this work we have presented the first photometric follow - up of the transiting extrasolar planetary system wasp-44 .",
    "one transit was observed using wfc on the int , and two transits were observed in seven passbands simultaneously using grond on the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope . using these new datasets plus another one taken from the literature @xcite",
    ", we have obtained improved measurements of the orbital ephemerides and physical properties of the system . in particular",
    ", we found that the radius of wasp-44b is smaller than previously found , and is different ( at @xmath79 confidence level ) from that theoretically expected for a free - core planet @xcite .",
    "this suggests that wasp-44b is a `` heavy element rich '' planet , with the heavy elements being in a distinct core or mixed within the h / he envelope .",
    "such a result is important in order to draw an accurate _ mass  radius _ plot for teps , which provides key diagnostic for theoretical works that look to infer the bulk composition of the giant planets and distinguish them ( in some cases ) from brown dwarfs .",
    "although grond was not designed for follow - up studies of planetary transits , it is one of the very few imaging systems worldwide able to perform simultaneous photometric multi - band observations .",
    "the later fact makes grond an efficient and very useful instrument to detect transit anomalies or to probe the atmosphere of teps .",
    "indeed , atomic and molecular absorption as well as scattering processes may result in detectable radius variations as a function of wavelength @xcite .",
    "@xcite already used grond in the case of gj1214b , but they restricted their analysis only to the optical bands . here , for the first time , we used all the seven band of this powerful instrument , to search for variations of the radius of wasp-44b with wavelength .",
    "we measured the planetary radius in the seven grond passbands , corresponding to a wavelength coverage of 3702440 nm , and compared them to a synthetic spectrum based on an isothermal model atmosphere in chemical equilibrium .",
    "the model reproduces the radius values in the optical , in agreement with the equilibrium temperature of wasp-44b but , our data lack the precision to rule out the possibility that the planetary radius does not vary with wavelength .",
    "it does not predict the radius values found in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 bands , which differ by roughly 23 and 10 atmospheric pressure scale heights to those in the other bands .",
    "this phenomenon is most likely due to the comparatively low quality of the nir data .",
    "we have worked to reduce the sources of noise in the subsequent uses of the grond instrument .",
    "more enticing results were obtained for other teps and will be shown in forthcoming papers .",
    "based on observations collected at the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope located at eso la silla , chile .",
    "operations of this telescope are jointly performed by the max planck gesellschaft and the european southern observatory .",
    "grond has been built by the high - energy group of mpe in collaboration with the lsw tautenburg and eso , and is operating as a pi - instrument at the mpg / eso 2.2 m telescope .",
    "we thank david anderson for supplying photometric data , and timo anguita and rgis lachaume for their technical assistance during the observations .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for their useful criticisms and suggestions that helped us to improve the quality of the present paper .",

    "the calibration of the grond nir data is a little more complicated than the optical data , because of the presence of electronic odd - even read - out pattern along the y - axis . in order to remove this pattern",
    ", we smooth each image and compare it with the unsmoothed ons after the master dark has been subtracted .",
    "the amplitudes of the read - out pattern are then determined by comparing the median level of each column to the overall median level .",
    "each column is shifted back to the overall median level .",
    "the master skyflats are divided out from the science images after the removal of read - out pattern .",
    "since our observations are in staring mode , sky background is an important contribution in the images . with",
    "the 20-position dithering sky measurements right before and after the science time series , we could construct a sky emission model for each science image .",
    "these sky images are calibrated in the same way as the science images .",
    "we mask out all the stars in the calibrated sky images , and normalise each image with their own overall median levels .",
    "all the normalised skies are then median combined , and normalised again . for each science image , we scale the pre- and post - science sky models to their background individually .",
    "the final sky model is constructed by weighted combining them according to the inverse square of fitted @xmath80 .",
    "this sky model is then subtracted from corresponding science image . after sky subtraction",
    ", we still see remnant structure , which is expected due to the variation of the sky during the observing sequence .    after these calibrations have been applied , we perform aperture photometry on wasp-44 as well as three nearby comparison stars",
    ". the locations of each star are determined by idl / find , which calculates the centroids by fitting gaussians to the marginal x and y distributions . in order to find the optimal photometry",
    ", we lay 30 apertures on all the stars in step of 0.5 pixel , each with ten annuli in step of 1 pixel .",
    "this produces 300 datasets with different aperture settings . in this way ,",
    "the above mentioned sky subtraction remnant effect is accounted for in the sky annulus adopted in the aperture photometry .",
    "we divide the flux of each star with its own median value .",
    "a composite reference light curve is constructed by median - combining fluxes of ensembles of comparison stars , which are required to show the least deviation from the target .",
    "we normalixe the target light curve with this composite reference light curve .",
    "since the normalised light curve still shows strong red noise correlated with positions , seeing and airmass , instead of selecting the optimal photometry directly from @xmath81 of out - of - transit baseline , we fit the whole light curve simultaneously with the theoretical light curve model multiplied with a baseline correction function .",
    "this correction function consists of positions / time in quadratic form , and fwhms / airmass in linear form .",
    "we tried to select the optimal light curves by choosing the ones with the least @xmath81 of o  c flux residuals among all the datasets .",
    "however , the transit depths of the optimal light curves of the same band from different nights are very deviant from each other .",
    "we note that light curves of the same band obtained using different aperture and annulus sizes could exhibit similar least @xmath81 , however produce different transit depths .",
    "therefore , for each nir band , we choose the two light curves with the least @xmath81 and with consistent transit depth between the two nights as our final optimal photometric results ."

    "<S> we achieved low scatters of 12 mmag per observation in the optical bands with a cadence of @xmath5s , but the nir - band light curves present much greater scatter . </S>",
    "<S> we also observed another transit of wasp-44 b by using a gunn-@xmath6 filter and telescope defocussing , with a scatter of 0.37 mmag per point and an observing cadence around @xmath7s . </S>",
    "<S> we used these data to improve measurements of the time of mid - transit and the physical properties of the system . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we improved the radius measurements of the star and planet by factors of 3 and 4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the radius of wasp-44b is @xmath8 ( statistical and systematic errors , respectively ) , which is slightly smaller than previously thought and differs from that expected for a core - free planet . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , with the help of a synthetic spectrum , we investigated the theoretically - predicted variation of the planetary radius as a function of wavelength , covering the range @xmath9@xmath10 nm . we can rule out extreme variations at optical wavelengths , but unfortunately our data are not precise enough ( especially in the nir bands ) to differentiate between the theoretical spectrum and a radius which does not change with wavelength .    </S>",
