    "<S> fully reconstructed jets and direct photon - tagged jet fragments significantly reduce energy - loss bias , the bias toward mostly measuring particles from partons which suffer little energy loss . in d+au collisions , </S>",
    "<S> one accesses the physics at large @xmath0 , which yields important constraints for nuclear parton distribution functions . in both d+au and a+a collisions , coherent multiple - scattering models of energy loss </S>",
    "<S> can be tested . in this contribution , we present the current results from the phenix experiment on fully reconstructed jets and direct @xmath1-hadron correlations . </S>",
    "<S> baseline measurements of jets in p+p collisions as well as their yield and correlation modifications in d+au and cu+cu will be given . from @xmath1-hadron correlations , </S>",
    "<S> we present the fragmentation function in p+p and au+au collisions and its modification in au+au to @xmath2 lower than what has previously been studied . </S>",
    "<S> implications of this data on our understanding of both cold and hot , dense nuclear matter created at rhic are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> the phenix experiment has a mature program of measuring hard processes to perform precision qcd analysis and using these rare probes to characterize the medium produced at rhic . in this contribution the current analysis of prompt @xmath1-hadron correlations and fully reconstructed jets are discussed .    </S>",
    "<S> phenix has measured the azimuthal correlations between prompt photons and charged hadrons using two different methods . in p+p collisions , after removing photons event - by - event from hadronic decays , direct photons are measured using an isolation cut requiring that the sum of track @xmath3 and electromagnetic cluster energy in a cone of radius ( @xmath4 ) 0.3 be less than 10% of the candidate photon s @xmath3@xcite . because of the large underlying event in au+au collisions , an isolation cut is difficult . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we have measured direct @xmath1-hadron correlations statistically@xcite . this is done by measuring the inclusive @xmath1-hadron correlations and @xmath5-triggered correlations which are then mapped to decay photon correlations . </S>",
    "<S> since we measure the ratio of inclusive to direct photons independently , we can subtract the decay-@xmath1-triggered correlation from the inclusive to obtain the direct-@xmath1-triggered correlations . </S>",
    "<S> both methods yield similar results in p+p collisions giving evidence that the methods are robust .    /ndf </S>",
    "<S> = 12.16/7.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ] /ndf = 12.16/7.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    using these direct - photon - tagged correlations we can obtain the fragmentation function of the opposing jet , assuming the photon fixes the jet energy . </S>",
    "<S> we measure the per - trigger yield of hadrons correlated within @xmath6 from the direct photon as a function of @xmath7 this is shown for p+p and au+au collisions in figure  [ fig : gammajetxi ] . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> data from tasso @xmath8 annihilation at @xmath914 gev is shown@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the p+p follow this tasso data well lending credence to the fact that we are measuring a quark fragmentation function . </S>",
    "<S> this is interesting especially considering the addition of @xmath10 in p+p collisions relative to @xmath8 annihilation which would modify the p+p with respect to @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> an arbitrarily normalized energy - loss modified mlla fragmentation function @xcite is plotted also and could be compared with the au+au data .    to see if there is any modification of the fragmentation function , we plot the ratio of the au+au fragmentation function to the tasso fragmentation function . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : gammajetxi ] . </S>",
    "<S> we use this ratio because we have yet to measure the p+p fragmentation function down to a hadron @xmath3 of 0.5 gev which yields @xmath11 values up to 3 . </S>",
    "<S> what we see in this ratio is that a flat line fit to this ratio yields a poor @xmath12ndf of 12.16/7 indicating that the shape of the fragmentation function is being modified in au+au collisions compared to tasso data .    </S>",
    "<S> another way to fix the jet energy scale is to fully reconstruct jets . </S>",
    "<S> phenix has studied jet reconstruction using the gaussian filter algorithm @xcite in cu+cu and p+p collisions . </S>",
    "<S> when running jet reconstruction algorithms in a heavy ion environment , it is necessary to carefully take into account the effects of the underlying event . beyond smearing the true energy and position of a jet , more significantly , the underlying event particles can cluster themselves and produce a jet according to the algorithm s definition  a so - called fake jet . in the cu+cu analysis , when the @xmath3 density of the particles are obtained , an event - averaged background , dependent on the centrality class , </S>",
    "<S> the z - vertex , and the reaction plane angle , is removed before the algorithm is run . </S>",
    "<S> after the algorithm is run , fake jets from the sample must be removed . </S>",
    "<S> this is done by a shape analysis of the jets where broad and diffuse jets are tagged and removed . </S>",
    "<S> the fake jet rejection cut is determined by evaluating its effectiveness at reducing the combinatorial contribution to di - jet @xmath13 distributions . </S>",
    "<S> to take into account the smearing of the underlying event , reconstructed jets from p+p collisions are embedded into minimum bias cu+cu events and the the algorithm is rerun . </S>",
    "<S> a transfer matrix is built based on the comparison of the input and output jets . </S>",
    "<S> this is used to unfold the effects of the underlying event so that the cu+cu is measured at the raw p+p reconstruction scale . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting jets at the p+p reconstruction scale are shown at the left panel of figure .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cucujets ] .     jets measured at the raw reconstructed p+p scale for @xmath14-scaled p+p jets(open circles ) and cu+cu ( closed circles ) for different centrality selections.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   jets measured at the raw reconstructed p+p scale for @xmath14-scaled p+p jets(open circles ) and cu+cu ( closed circles ) for different centrality selections.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    once the yields are obtained the nuclear modification factor , @xmath15 is be measured . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in the right panel of figure  [ fig : cucujets ] . </S>",
    "<S> there is a centrality - dependent suppression that is observed in the jet spectrum with the most peripheral events being consistent with no suppression . </S>",
    "<S> although we present below new evidence of possible cold nuclear effects that may contribute partially to this observed suppression , other explanations are possible . </S>",
    "<S> for one , out - of - cone radiation results in a lower jet energy in cu+cu than p+p , reducing @xmath15 . also , some of the removed fake jets are real , modified jets that are being excluded from the analysis . either or </S>",
    "<S> both mechanisms like contribute to the measured suppression . </S>",
    "<S> but , a suppression in either case indicates modification of jets . </S>",
    "<S> we are currently exploring precisely how the jets are modified .    </S>",
    "<S> we have also measured jets in d+au collisions using the anti-@xmath10 algorithm @xcite to explore the effects of cold nuclear matter . </S>",
    "<S> the underlying event in d+au collisions is less than cu+cu but not negligible . while subtracting an average </S>",
    "<S> underlying is not necessary , we are sensitive to correlated underlying event fluctuations that result in a jet according to the algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> because of this we have studied jets with @xmath16 and @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> to account for smearing from the underlying event , we use the same method as in cu+cu where p+p jets are embedded into minimum bias d+au events and the jets are rerun and compared . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting spectrum of jets into the phenix acceptance at the raw reconstructed p+p scale is shown in the left panel of figure .  </S>",

    "<S> ( right : ) the ratio of yields in central d+au to those in peripheral d+au.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    with the yields in hand , we can construct the ratio @xmath18 , the ratio of a central selection with the most peripheral selection . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown for @xmath16 jets on the right panel of figure  [ fig : daujets ] . </S>",
    "<S> what is seen is that the yield of jets is suppressed at the jet @xmath3 that we measure . </S>",
    "<S> this result is also consistent with the published single particle @xmath5 data@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> even though the @xmath19 is consistent with unity for all centrality selections within the large systematic uncertainty , an @xmath18 of the 0 - 20% central to the 60 - 88% peripheral selections do show a suppression of 20% . </S>",
    "<S> this suppression could indicate either that some form of cold nuclear matter energy loss is suppressing jets at rhic or that we are reaching @xmath0 values where the emc effect is reducing the number of partons in the nuclear wavefunction@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these considerations imply that we may need to re - interpret some of the high-@xmath3 suppression in au+au as being attributable to cold nuclear matter effects . </S>"
