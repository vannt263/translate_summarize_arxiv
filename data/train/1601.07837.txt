    "comets are small , icy objects originating from the outer solar system .",
    "they are the leftover planetesimals from the formation of the outer planets .",
    "these objects remain in the outer solar system for most of their lifetime , until perturbations sent them into the inner solar system where they become visible .",
    "it has been noted that the observable comet population displays a large diversity in ice composition which , apart from evolutionary effects , is linked to predictions that comet nuclei were formed at different places and times in the solar nebula ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the observation of comets provides a unique opportunity for understanding the range of chemistry in the primitive solar nebula .    however , the quest is not without its obstacles .",
    "observational interpretations are biased by the fact that more active comets tend to be easier to detect and study , meaning that less active comets are somewhat underrepresented in the sample .",
    "dynamical investigations are limited by the chaotic nature of the orbital evolution of small bodies , which make it challenging to reconstruct the orbit of history over even modest timescales ( e.g. @xmath4  yr ) .",
    "the fact that the evolutionary processes of cometary nuclei are little understood makes it difficult to isolate evolutionary effects from formation diversity when addressing the volatile inventory of individual objects .    numerical integrations carried out by @xcite indicate that jupiter - family comet ( jfc ) 252p / linear might have entered the near - earth object ( neo ) region only @xmath5 orbits ago .",
    "this short dynamical timescale suggests that 252p / linear should be a `` physically young '' comet , considering the typical physical lifetime of near - earth jfcs of 150200 revolutions @xcite .",
    "however , with an absolute total magnitude of @xmath6 , 252p / linear exhibits the characteristics of a weakly active comet @xcite .",
    "considering its recent entry to the neo region , we expect evolutionary processes to have played a relatively minor role in altering the subsurface volatile composition",
    ". one possible explanation of the weak activity in this young comet could be a volatile - poor environment at the time of formation of the nucleus .",
    "the 2016 perihelion passage of 252p / linear offers an exceptional opportunity for earth - based observers to study the comet .",
    "the comet will pass perihelion on 2016 mar .",
    "15 and make a close approach to the earth on 2016 mar . 21 at 0.036  au , which is one of the closest cometary approaches to the earth on record .",
    "the earth may also have passed through the dust trails produced by 252p / linear during its past revolutions , potentially producing meteor activity . despite the proximity of 252p / linear s nodal point to the earth s orbit ,",
    "meteor activity from 252p / linear has not been reported .",
    "however , it is well known that meteor observations are useful in understanding of the physical history of a comet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "meteoroids from 252p / linear could provide clues to the recent history of the comet .    in this letter",
    ", we examine the `` born ( almost ) dead '' scenario for the case of 252p / linear in preparation for the observation campaigns in mar . 2016 .",
    "we adopt two approaches : an examination of the dynamical evolution of the comet (   2 ) , as well as an analysis of the available comet and meteor observations guided by an existing cometary dust model (   3 ) .",
    "results from both tracks are discussed and summarized in   4 .",
    "we generated 1000 `` clones '' of 252p / linear using its orbital covariance matrix provided in jpl  28 , and integrated them @xmath7  yr backwards in time from 2000  ad .",
    "integration was performed with the mercury6 package using the symplectic integrator @xcite .",
    "clones are considered to have been ejected from the solar system when they reach a heliocentric distance of 100  au .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : clone ] , we confirm the recent ( circa . 1800  ad ) entry of 252p / linear into the neo region .",
    "the distribution of the clones is extremely compact until a close approach to jupiter in 1690  ad ( miss distance @xmath8  au ) .",
    "there have been a few recent approaches to the earth : 0.10  au in mar .",
    "2000 ( when the comet was discovered ) , 0.08  au in mar . 1921 , and 0.05",
    "au in feb . 1847 .",
    "if the activity level of 252p / linear in the 19th century is comparable to what it is today , the comet would have been at + 10 mag during its approach in 1847 .",
    "we searched through the catalog of 19th century comets compiled by @xcite but do not find any association .",
    "comets at this magnitude may be at the observational limit for 19th century observers @xcite , but the lack of detection also implies that the comet was probably not substantially much more active at that time compared to today .    with evidence that 252p / linear has possibly been very weakly active since its current entry to the neo region , it is possible that the comet depleted most of its volatiles during a previous residency in the neo region .",
    "the question then becomes : how long did 252p / linear reside in the neo region in the past ? to answer this question , we extend our integration backward and forward in time for @xmath1  years .",
    "we find the median elapsed residency in the solar system ( i.e. the time that the clone _ already _ spent as a bounded object ) to be @xmath9  years and median elapsed neo region residency to be @xmath2  years . the median dynamical lifetime ( i.e. the _ total _ time that the clone has and will spend as a bounded object ) and median integrated time as a neo are found to be @xmath10  years and @xmath11  years respectively .",
    "while this dynamical and neo lifetime is comparable to the values for the general jfc population @xcite , we note that the elapsed residency as a neo is virtually null as it is certain the comet has already spent @xmath12  years in the neo region ( since its current entry in @xmath0  ad ) .",
    "this suggests that 252p / linear is likely a first time ( or , almost first time ) visitor to the neo region .",
    "we also examine the time that 252p / linear has spent in a `` visible '' state ( i.e. @xmath13  au , * ? ? ?",
    "the value of 2.5  au is considered as the distance from the sun that water ice sublimation is expected to start ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we find the elapsed and total median time of 252p / linear as a visible comet to be @xmath11  yr and @xmath14  yr , the latter of which is more in line to literature values ( @xmath15  yr as given by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) compared to that in the neo region .",
    "this indicates that 252p / linear may have been active for some time before it entered the neo region ; but the process of thermal devolatilization occurs on longer timescales for comets with larger @xmath16 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the current and past dust production of comets can be constrained by cometary and meteor observations .",
    "a parameter commonly used as a proxy for cometary dust production is the @xmath17 parameter @xcite :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the heliocentric distance of the comet , @xmath20 is the geocentric distance of the comet , @xmath21 is the linear radius of the photometric aperture at the distance of the comet , and @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the apparent magnitudes of the sun and the comet .    prior to its 2016 perihelion passage , 252p / linear had only been observed during its 2000 and 2010 passages ( the 2005 passage was not observed possibly due to poor viewing geometry ) .",
    "however , the 2010 passage was only observed at @xmath24  au on its outbound leg and the comet had likely already ceased activity .",
    "hence , we only use the observations from the 2000 passage which cover a section of @xmath25  au to 1.5  au on the outbound leg of the comet .",
    "we obtain a total of 80 observations from the minor planet center observation database ( http://www.minorplanetcenter.net/db_search/show_object?object_id=252p ) and calculate the @xmath17 quantity using equation  [ eq : afrho ] .",
    "the @xmath21 parameter accounts for the photometric aperture which differs among observers ; to simplify the problem , we adopt an aperture of @xmath26 from the conservative ( small ) end of coma diameter estimations @xcite",
    ". the computed @xmath17 are therefore at the upper end of possible values .",
    "the temporal variation of the @xmath17 parameter of 252p / linear during its 2000 perihelion passage is shown as figure  [ fig : afrho ] . the upward trend before @xmath27  d ( @xmath28 is the perihelion epoch ) is likely an artifact due to small @xmath20 at the time of the observation and the conservative @xmath21 used in the calculation , resulting in an underestimation of the cometary flux ( coma diameter estimation given in * ? ? ?",
    "* varies from @xmath26 to @xmath29 ) .",
    "the median @xmath17 value is 0.6  cm , one of the lowest numbers ever measured for a comet and comparable with the reported @xmath17 of another low activity comet , 209p / linear @xcite .",
    "we further note that the @xmath17 may be contaminated by the light reflected from the nucleus given the extremely low dust production of 252p / linear , which may result in some overestimation of the measured @xmath17 ; hence , the actual @xmath17 could be even lower .    to search for any meteor activity originated from 252p / linear ,",
    "we make use of the monte carlo meteoroid stream model developed in our earlier works ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "integrations are performed using the 15th order radau integrator bundled with the mercury6 package @xcite .",
    "gravitational perturbations from the eight major planets ( with the earth - moon system represented by a single mass at the barycenter of the two bodies ) , radiation pressure , and poynting - robertson effect are included .",
    "we first integrate 252p / linear back to 1800  ad ( i.e. back to its entry into the neo region ) and then integrate it forward in time , releasing meteoroids in the diameter range of @xmath30 ( i.e. the diameter range that associates with visible meteors ) when the comet is at each perihelion , assuming a bulk density of @xmath31 and a size distribution of @xmath32 .",
    "modeling of meteoroid streams is usually insensitive to the ejection model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; however , since 252p / linear is apparently a low activity comet , we use two different ejection models and repeat the simulation for each one of them : the `` low activity scenario '' described in @xcite and the `` normal scenario '' described in @xcite . at the completion of the integration",
    ", we examine two scenarios of possible meteor activity : ( 1 ) meteor outbursts from young meteoroid trails .",
    "this is examined by selecting meteoroids that are approaching the earth within 0.01  au in the period of interest ; and ( 2 ) annual `` background '' activity , i.e. activity from older , more dispersed trails , this is examined by selecting meteoroids with minimum orbit intersection distance ( moid ) with respect to the earth s orbit @xmath33  au .    the simulation result for 20012020",
    "is listed in table  [ tbl : met ] .",
    "we note that the result is sensitive to the choice of ejection model in contrast to other meteor showers , probably due to the relatively young age of the trails and small encounter speed . by applying the flux estimation technique outlined in @xcite",
    ", we find that most of these computed activities are below the detection limit of modern meteor surveys , except for the outburst cases of 2011 and 2016 . in 2011",
    "the earth passed close to the 1984- and 1989-trail , which are very young and compact trails formed recently .",
    "however , the characteristic minimum orbit intersection distance ( moid ) of both encounters are close to the selection limit ( close to @xmath34  au ) , therefore the possibility of meteor activity is likely minimal . in 2016 ,",
    "the earth will pass close to the 1915- , 1921- and 1926-trails . assuming the dust production rate of 252p / linear in the 1920s is comparable to its current value , the meteor flux is likely to be at the order of @xmath35 to @xmath36 , or less than a few meteors in terms of zenith hourly rate ( zhr ) .",
    "next , we conducted a search in the survey data collected by the canadian meteor orbit radar ( cmor ) ( c.f . * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "we apply the wavelet technique described in @xcite at the computed radiants to search for meteor activity , without finding any enhancement ( figure  [ fig : wc ] ) . using the number of background meteors detected by cmor within a radius of @xmath37 of the expected radiant and @xmath38 from the expected meteoroid speed , as well as the cmor collection area as a function of the declination @xcite",
    ", we estimate the upper limit of the meteoroid flux to be at the order of @xmath39 to a limiting mass of @xmath40  kg , with an uncertainty within a factor of several due to the unconstrained mass distribution of the stream ( which affects the collection area ) .    from the simulation , we find the meteoroid delivery efficiency ( i.e. the fraction of the ejected meteoroids with moid@xmath33  au ) to be @xmath41 .",
    "assuming that the meteoroids are uniformly distributed along the orbit of 252p / linear , we can estimate the past dust production since the comet s entry into the neo region using    n =    where @xmath42 is the meteoroid production per orbit , @xmath43 is the upper limit of meteoroid flux constrained by meteor data , @xmath44  years is the orbital period of the meteoroids , @xmath45  au is the collection area , and @xmath46 is the number of orbits that the comet is active . by inserting numbers from previous analysis",
    ", we get @xmath47 meteoroids , or @xmath48  kg per orbit appropriate to millimeter - sized dust ( assuming a bulk density of @xmath31 ) . for comparison ,",
    "the dust production rate of 55p / tempel - tuttle ( parent of the leonid meteor shower ) is of the order of @xmath49  kg per orbit @xcite .",
    "while the actual number may be off by an order of magnitude , such extremely low number illustrate 252p / linear as a comet with very low dust production , as well as its lack of significant activity since its entry to the neo region .",
    "the two lines of evidence  dynamical and observational  have outlined 252p / linear as a comet that is likely an ( almost ) first - time visitor to the neo region , yet only little active in terms of dust production .",
    "these evidences support the hypothesis that 252p / linear was likely to have formed in a volatile - poor environment , as compared to other members in the visible jfc population .",
    "cometary and meteor observations during its close approach in mar .",
    "2016 will likely provide more information regarding the surface and evolutionary properties of this unique comet .",
