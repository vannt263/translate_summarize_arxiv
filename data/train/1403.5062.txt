    "while the linear response cdft method has been widely applied to open - shell systems,@xcite there pose some ambiguities for closed - shell systems.@xcite since the closed - shell states are far below the fermi level , a small local perturbation potential @xmath2 does not give a meaningful density change ( @xmath3 ) in the localized states .",

    "we first apply the perturbation potential @xmath20 projected to the @xmath1 states of a cu atom in the supercell , which induces the @xmath1 level shift _ without _ any screening [ fig . [ fig1](a)-(h ) ] .",
    "the elimination of the screening to the perturbation potential was done by the non - self - consistent calculations ; the perturbed dft hamiltonian ( constructed with the @xmath20 perturbation potential and the unperturbed charge density ) was diagonalized without updating the charge density .",

    ", the increase of the fermi level also occurs by the finite size of the supercell , and the screening changes the host valence states ( the @xmath21 states both at the perturbed and unperturbed sites and the @xmath1 states of the unperturbed cu atom ) [ see fig .
