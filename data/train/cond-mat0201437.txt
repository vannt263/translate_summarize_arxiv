    "coulomb blockade phenomena have atracted much interest during the last few dacades  @xcite .",
    "creation of confined electron systems at the nanometer scale has made it possible to study the quantum - meachnical nature of the band electron in a variety of materials .",
    "the tunability of the quantum - dot devices provided a unique opportunity to study the charging effects , and hence , the correlation effects associated with the coulomb charging energy . however , in confined systems of smaller sizes , where the size - quantization energy is resolved , new correlations set in due to the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "this brings along the electron spin as a degree of freedom in quantum confined structures , and accessing it in a deterministic way would allow for novel implementations in quantum information processing .",
    "an increasing number of spin - related experiments  @xcite indeed show that the spin of the electron in quantum - confined nanostructures is a promising candidate for information processing , due to the unusually long ( 100 s nanosecs ) spin dephasing times  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "there are propsed methods  @xcite for efficient and deterministic control of the spin state in single quantum dots as well as methods of entangling the spins of two dots , the latter being a crucial element in quantum information processing .",
    "thus , the field of interest falls into two parts , one being improving the technologies for conventional computation , and the other  implementing fundamentally new algorithms of computation with quantum bits of information ( qubits ) and devising a scalable quantum computer in the long run . in conventional computers , the electron spin can be expected to enhance the performance of quantum electronic devices , such as spin - transistors ( based on spin - currents and spin injection ) , non - volatile memories , single spin as the ultimate limit of information storage etc .",
    "@xcite . for implementing quantum computing  @xcite , as first pointed out in ref .",
    ", the spin of a confined electron appears as the most natural candidate for the qubit .",
    "indeed , provided the spin - orbit coupling is negligible , the intrinsic two - state space of the spin encodes exactly one qubit and allows for no undesired parts of the hilbert space , transitions to which could lead to leakage errors in quantum computation .",
    "we have shown  @xcite that the spin qubits , when located in quantum - confined structures such as semiconductor quantum dots or atoms or molecules , satisfy all requirements needed for a scalable quantum computer .",
    "the long distances , of up to @xmath0  @xcite , over which spins can be transported phase - coherently , make the electron spin a plausible candidate for quantum information transmission in solid state devices . a spin - qubit attached to a mobile electron",
    "can be transported along conducting wires between different subunits in a quantum network  @xcite .",
    "entangled electrons , which can be created in coupled quantum dots or via a superconductor  @xcite , provide a source of einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr ) pairs  @xcite , wich are necessary for secure quantum communication .",
    "the methods used to implement the electron spin in conventional computers and in quantum computers are often identical , because of the quantum - mechanical nature of the electron and its spin .",
    "our short - term goal is to find ways to control the coherent dynamics of electron spins in quantum - confined nanostructures .",
    "the use of solid state physics as a base for implementing the quantum computer is motivated by the unparalleled flexibility in designing an appropriate medium for the realization of a given physical phenomena .    in the following , we review the status of our theoretical efforts towards the goal of implementing quantum computation with electron spins in quantum - confined nanostructures .",
    "the possibility of outperforming classical computation , which opens up in quantum algorithms such as the one discovered by shor  @xcite and by grover  @xcite , has attracted much interest .",
    "a quantum algorithm makes use of the quantum computers s ability to exist in any superposition of the states of its binary basis and to perform quantum time evolution for computation ; hence the parallelism of quantum computing .",
    "the requirement for the quantum bit of information ( qubit ) , which is at the heart of the quantum computer , is that it can exist in any state of a quantum two two - level system , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath1 , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the states of the `` classical '' bit , and @xmath4 .",
    "apart from this , a qubit should be able to couple to any other qubit in the quantum comupter and form a coherent two - qubit state .",
    "these two elements , which are the one- and two - qubit gates , are sufficient for forming a many - qubit coherent state and implementing any quantum algorithm .",
    "a recently growing list of quantum tasks  @xcite such as cryptography , error correcting schemes , quantum teleportation , etc .",
    "have indicated even more the desirability of experimental implementations of quantum computing . on the other hand , there is also a growing number of proposed physical implementations of qubits and quantum gates .",
    "a few examples are : trapped ions  @xcite , cavity qed  @xcite , nuclear spins  @xcite , superconducting devices  @xcite , and our qubit proposal  @xcite based on the spin of the electron in quantum - confined nanostructures , and in particular in quantum dots with an all - electrical control of spin .",
    "subsequent proposals such as  @xcite are based on the same principles as introduced in  @xcite and reviewed herein .",
    "2    semiconductor quantum dots are structures where charge carriers are confined in all three spatial dimensions , the dot size being of the order of the fermi wavelength in the host material , typically between @xmath5 and @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "the confinement is usually achieved by electrical gating of a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , possibly combined with etching techniques , see fig .",
    "[ figarray ] .",
    "precise control of the number of electrons in the conduction band of a quantum dot ( starting from zero ) has been achieved in gaas heterostructures  @xcite .",
    "the electronic spectrum of typical quantum dots can vary strongly when an external magnetic field is applied  @xcite , since the magnetic length corresponding to typical laboratory fields @xmath7 is comparable to typical dot sizes . in coupled quantum dots coulomb blockade effects  @xcite ,",
    "tunneling between neighboring dots  @xcite , and magnetization  @xcite have been observed as well as the formation of a delocalized single - particle state  @xcite .",
    "magneto - optical experiments , based on time - resolved faraday rotation measurements , show long spin coherence times in doped gaas in the bulk and a 2deg@xcite . at @xmath8 and @xmath9 ,",
    "a transverse spin lifetime ( dephasing time ) @xmath10 exceeding @xmath11 was measured , with experimental indications that this time is a single - spin effect@xcite . since this number still includes inhomogeneous effects ",
    "g - factor variations in the material , leading to spins rotating with slightly different frequencies and thus reducing the total magnetization ",
    "it represents only a lower bound of the decoherence time @xmath12 of a _ single _ spin , @xmath13 , which is relevant for using spins as qubits . using the same pump - probe technique , spin dephasing times in semiconductor ( cdse ) quantum dots",
    "have been measured  @xcite , with at most one spin per dot .",
    "the relatively small @xmath10 dephasing times ( a few ns at vanishing magnetic field ) , which have been seen in these experiments , probably originate from a large inhomogeneous broadening due to a strong variation of g - factors  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , the fact that many coherent oscillations were observed   provides strong experimental support to the idea of using electron spin as a qubit .      to outperform a classical computer ,",
    "a quantum computer will need a number of qubits on the order of @xmath14 .",
    "hence , it is essential that the underlying concept can be scaled up to a large number of qubits .",
    "this scaling requirement is , in principle , achievable with spin - based qubits confined in quantum dots , since producing arrays of quantum dots  @xcite is feasible with today s technology of defining nanostructures in semiconductors .",
    "of course , the actual implementation of such arrays ( see fig .  [ figarray ] ) including all the needed circuits poses tremendous experimental challenges , but at least we are not aware of any physical restriction which would exclude such an upscaling for spin - qubits .",
    "quantum gate operations can be controlled through an effective hamiltonian ( see sec .",
    "[ secsspinrot ] and  [ sec2bit ] ) @xmath15 the coupling constants @xmath16 , @xmath17 and the magnetic field ( local ) @xmath18 are controlled via external gate fields , which are switched with some pulses @xmath19 . in the following we assume @xmath16 to be non - zero only for the neighboring qubits .",
    "note , however , that in cavity - qed systems there is also a long - range coupling of qubits  @xcite , and that long - range coupling via a superconductor is also possible  @xcite .",
    "but even if the exchange coupling is only local , operations on non - neighboring qubits can still be performed .",
    "this is achieved by swapping states of neighboring qubits ( see sec .  [ sec2bit ] ) , which allows one to move the qubit around in an array of quantum dots and couple it to the desired other qubit .    for the gating mechanisms described in sec .",
    "[ secsspinrot ] and  [ sec2bit ] , only the time integral @xmath20 ( mod @xmath21 ) is important . here",
    ", @xmath22 stands for the exchange coupling @xmath23 or the zeeman interaction .",
    "the requirement on the pulse shape is that it does not violate the validity of the effective hamiltonian ( [ eqngenh ] ) , but otherwise the gating mechanisms are independent of the actual shape of @xmath19 . since the effective hamiltonian ( [ eqngenh ] )",
    "was obtained by projecting out higher energy states of one and two coupled dots ( see sec .",
    "[ ssecldots ] ) , care should be taken that the pulses do not excite the quantum dots to the projected - out energy levels .",
    "this can be achieved by switching @xmath19 adiabatically , i.e.  such that @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the energy scale on which excitations may occur .",
    "we find that @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the pulse amplitude and @xmath28 the characteristic width , is optimal for a fast adiabatic switching , provided @xmath29 .",
    "for a detailed analysis of adiabatic switching , see  @xcite .",
    "a single qubit operations can be performed for example in g - factor - modulated materials , as described in sec .",
    "[ secsspinrot ] .",
    "a spin can be rotated by a relative angle of @xmath30 through changing the effective g - factor by @xmath31 for a time @xmath32 .",
    "thus , a typical switching time for an angle @xmath33 , a field @xmath34 , and @xmath35 is @xmath36 .",
    "if slower operations are required , they are easily implemented by choosing a smaller @xmath31 , reducing the magnitude of the field @xmath37 , or by replacing @xmath38 by @xmath39 with integer @xmath40 .",
    "next we consider two exchange - coupled spins , which perform a square - root - of - swap gate for the integrated pulse @xmath41 , as described in sec .",
    "[ sec2bit ] .",
    "we apply a pulse @xmath42 with @xmath43 , and choose @xmath44 , which gives for the switching time @xmath45 , and the adiabaticity criterion @xmath46 .",
    "realization of a reliable error - correction scheme  @xcite is one of the main goals in quantum computation .",
    "the known schemes for fault - tolerant quantum computation work if the gate operation error rate does not exceed a certain threshold value , usually about @xmath47 ( depending on the scheme)@xcite . if we take the ratio of the switching times from sec .",
    "[ ssecpulse ] , @xmath48 , and the dephasing time from sec .",
    "[ sseccoherence ] , @xmath49 , we obtain a value close to this threshold .",
    "thus , in our proposal , we can expect an arbitrary upscaling of the quantum computer , and we are no further limited by decoherence and lacking gate precision .",
    "we note that implementing an error - correction scheme requires a larger number of gate operations , and therefore , it is desirable to perform them in parallel ; otherwise the pursued gain in computational power is used up for error correction .",
    "hence , one favors concepts where a localized control of the gates can be realized such that operations can be performed in parallel .",
    "however , since there are still many milestones to reach before sophisticated error - correction schemes can be applied , one should by no means disregard setups where gate operations are performed in a serial way .",
    "for quantum computing it is necessary ( but not sufficient ) to perform one - qubit operations . in the context of spin - qubits",
    ", it translates into single - spin rotations .",
    "this can be achieved by exposing a specific qubit to a time - varying zeeman coupling @xmath50  @xcite , which can be controlled through both the magnetic field @xmath51 and/or the g - factor @xmath52 . since only phases have a relevance , it is sufficient to rotate all spins of the system at once ( e.g.  by an external field @xmath37 ) , but with a different larmor frequency .",
    "localized magnetic fields can be generated with the magnetic tip of a scanning force microscope , a magnetic disk writing head , by placing the dots above a grid of current - carrying wires , or by placing a small wire coil above the dot etc .",
    "single - spin rotations can be achieved by esr techniques  @xcite .",
    "one applies a static local magnetic field @xmath37 for the qubit(s ) , which should be rotated .",
    "an ac magnetic field is then applied perpendicular to the first field with the resonant frequency that matches the larmor frequency @xmath53 . due to paramagnetic resonance  @xcite",
    ", this causes spin - flips in the quantum dots with the corresponding zeeman splitting .",
    "the equilibrium position of the electron can be moved around through electrical gating .",
    "thus , if the electron wave function is pushed into a region with a different magnetic field strength or ( effective ) g - factor , one produces a relative rotation around the direction of @xmath51 by an angle of @xmath54 , see fig .",
    "[ figarray ] .",
    "regions with an increased magnetic field can be provided by a magnetic ( dot ) material while an effective magnetic field can be produced e.g.  with dynamically polarized nuclear spins ( overhauser effect )  @xcite .",
    "we shall now explain a concept for using g - factor - modulated materials  @xcite . in bulk semiconductors the free - electron value of the land g - factor @xmath55 is modified by spin - orbit coupling .",
    "similarly , the g - factor can be drastically enhanced by doping the semiconductor with magnetic impurities  @xcite . in confined structures such as quantum wells , wires , and dots ,",
    "the g - factor is further modified and becomes sensitive to an external bias voltage  @xcite .",
    "we have numerically analyzed a system with a layered structure ( algaas - gaas - inalgaas - algaas ) , in which the effective g - factor of electrons is varied by shifting their equilibrium position from one layer to another by electrical gating .",
    "we have found that in this structure the effective g - factor can be changed by about @xmath35  @xcite .",
    "such a gate - controlled g - factor modulation has now been confirmed experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the main component for every computer concept is a multi-(qu)bit gate , which eventually allows calculations through combination of several ( qu)bits . since two - qubit gates are ( in combination with single - qubit operations ) sufficient for quantum computation  @xcite  they form a universal set  we now focus on a mechanism that couples pairs of spin - qubits .",
    "such a mechanism exists in coupled quantum dots , resulting from the combined action of the coulomb interaction and the pauli exclusion principle . two coupled electrons in absence of a magnetic field have a spin - singlet ground state , while the first excited state in the presence of strong coulomb repulsion is a spin triplet .",
    "higher excited states are separated from these two lowest states by an energy gap , given either by the coulomb repulsion or the single - particle confinement .",
    "the low - energy dynamics of such a system can be described by the effective heisenberg spin hamiltonian @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the exchange coupling between the two spins @xmath58 and @xmath59 , i.e.  the energy difference between the triplet and the singlet . after a pulse of @xmath57 with @xmath60 ( mod @xmath21 )",
    ", the time evolution @xmath61 corresponds to the `` swap '' operator @xmath62 , whose application leads to an interchange of the states in qubit  1 and  2  @xcite . while @xmath62 is not sufficient for quantum computation , any of its square roots @xmath63 , say @xmath64 , turns out to be a _ universal _ quantum gate .",
    "thus , it can be used , together with single - qubit rotations , to assemble any quantum algorithm .",
    "this is shown by constructing the known universal gate xor  @xcite , through combination of @xmath63 and single - qubit operations @xmath65 , applied in the sequence  @xcite , @xmath66    with these universal gates at hand , we can reduce the study of general quantum computation to the study of single - spin rotations ( see sec .  [ secsspinrot ] ) and the _ exchange mechanism _ ,",
    "in particular how @xmath57 can be controlled experimentally .",
    "the central idea is that @xmath57 can be switched by raising or lowering the tunneling barrier between the dots . in the following",
    ", we shall review our detailed calculations to describe such a mechanism .",
    "we note that the same principles can also be applied to other spin systems in quantum - confined structures , such as coupled atoms in a crystal , supramolecular structures , and overlapping shallow donors in semiconductors  @xcite etc . , using similar methods as explained below .",
    "we consider a system of two tunnel - coupled quantum dots , achieved by gating a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) , as described in sec .",
    "[ ssecqc ] .",
    "the dots are arranged in a plane ( see fig .",
    "[ doub_dot ] ) , at a sufficiently small distance @xmath67 , such that the electrons can tunnel between the dots .",
    "the tunnel junction between the dots , as well as the number of electrons on each dot , is controlled by the depleting gates ( see fig .",
    "[ figarray ] ) .",
    "we consider the case of similar dots , and each dot contains an odd number of electrons with a spin 1/2 ground state .",
    "furthermore , we simplify our consideration by retaining only one electron per dot and assuming that the rest of the electrons form a closed shell and merely contribute to the confining potential of the gates .",
    "we model the two coupled dots with the hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath68 , where the single - electron dynamics in the 2deg ( @xmath69-plane ) is described through @xmath70 with @xmath71 being the effective mass and @xmath72 the confinement potential as given below .",
    "a magnetic field @xmath73 is applied along the @xmath74-axis , which couples to the electron spin through the zeeman interaction @xmath75 and to the charge through the vector potential @xmath76 . in almost depleted regions , like few - electron quantum dots",
    ", the screening length @xmath77 can be expected to be much larger than the screening length in bulk 2deg regions ( where it is @xmath78 for gaas ) .",
    "thus , for small quantum dots , say @xmath79 , we need to consider the bare coulomb interaction @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the static dielectric constant . the confinement and tunnel - coupling in eq .",

    "separated dots ( @xmath84 ) are thus modeled as two harmonic wells with frequency @xmath85 .",
    "this is motivated by the experimental evidence that the low - energy spectrum of single dots is well described by a parabolic confinement potential  @xcite .",
    "now we first classify the two - particle states according to the available symmetries , and then we calculate the phenomenological parameters within our toy model .",
    "the wave function of the two electrons in the double dot ( dd ) can be chosen to be a product of an orbital and a spin part .",
    "then , in a singlet ( triplet ) state the orbital part is symmetric ( antisymmetric ) with respect to the interchange of the electrons , while the spin part is antisymmetric ( symmetric ) . with respect to the _ mirror reflection _ in the @xmath86-plane",
    "@xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ doub_dot ] ) the single - particle states fall into two symmetries , which we label by the quantum number @xmath87 .",

    "are then given by  @xcite @xmath92 where the notation @xmath93 stands for the angular momentum representation of the total spin of the two electrons .",

    "the vacuum state @xmath2 includes the disregarded electrons .",
    "the _ interaction _ parameter @xmath96 depends on the interplay between the tunneling and coulomb interaction .",
    "we have calculated @xmath96  @xcite within the hund - mulliken method , @xmath97 where @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the extended inter - dot tunneling amplitude and on - site coulomb repulsion , respectively  @xcite .",

    "we consider the coulomb blockade regime  @xcite where the charge on the dot is quantized .",

    "we now consider a system , where the zeeman splitting in the leads is negligible ( i.e.   much smaller than the fermi energy ) , while on the dot it is given as @xmath172 .",

    "we have @xmath209 , thus , for @xmath210 , we see that the spin - filtering is very efficient .",
    "we discuss now the opposite case where the leads are fully spin polarized with a much smaller zeeman splitting on the dot  @xcite .",
    "such a situation can be realized with magnetic semiconductors ( with effective g - factors reaching 100  @xcite ) where spin - injection into gaas has recently been demonstrated for the first time@xcite .",

    "now the leads can provide and absorb only spin - up electrons .",
    "thus , a sequential tunneling current will only be possible if the dot state is @xmath188 ( to form a singlet with the incoming electron , whereas the triplet is excluded by energy conservation ) .",
    "hence , the current is much larger for the spin on the dot being in @xmath188 than it is for @xmath155 .",

    "our aim is to provide ways of accessing the exchange interaction @xmath23 between the spins of the two electrons in the dd .",
    "readily the differential cotunneling conductance through the dd shows distinct features ( steps at the bias @xmath220 ) , which allow one to measure @xmath23 experimentally .",

    "we find that the peculiar features in transport properties are better pronounced in the kondo regime .",
