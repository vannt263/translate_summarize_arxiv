    "thermal propagators of bosons in real - time thermal field theory carry the boltzmann factor @xmath0 . for a massless boson like gauge boson",
    ", this factor behaves as @xmath1 at the infrared region , @xmath2 , which leads to stronger infrared divergences in thermal amplitudes than in vacuum theory . in vacuum theory , it is well known@xcite that all the physical quantities are free from infrared singularities , provided one sums over all degenerate final states ( bloch nordsieck mechanism ) .",
    "an important exception to this general statement is the so - called coulomb singularity . for thermal reaction rates , due to the stronger infrared singularities mentioned above ,",
    "it is not known if they do not possess infrared singularities , except again for coulomb singularities .",
    "up until now , a proof is available of absence of leading infrared singularities in a generic thermal reaction rate@xcite and of all infrared singularities in a bremsstrahlung process within some specific approximation@xcite .",
    "it has been established@xcite that , to obtain a consistent perturbation expansion , resummations of hard - thermal - loop ( htl ) contributions are necessary . according to this htl resummation scheme , infrared behaviors of thermal amplitudes are softened or screened compared with those in naive perturbative calculation .",
    "this softening renders some otherwise divergent physical quantities finite@xcite .",
    "there are , however , some other physical quantities which are still infrared divergent to leading order in htl resummation scheme .",
    "a well - known example is the quark ( muon ) damping rate in a hot qcd ( qed ) plasma@xcite . as a matter of fact , the quark ( muon ) damping rate diverges due to the coulomb singularity .",
    "in naive perturbation calculation , the divergence is of power type . in htl resummation scheme ,",
    "as mentioned above , the infrared behaviour is softened and the infrared divergence becomes to be of logarithmic type .",
    "it is expected , at least for quark case , that the infrared singularity is screened when still higher order resummation is performed .",
    "as far as the infrared behaviour of a spinor field in qed is concerned , bloch - nordsieck approximation is a good approximation@xcite . in this paper ,",
    "the thermal two - point function of a heavy muon in a qed plasma is computed within this approximation .",
    "various properties of the result are discussed , among those is an especially important conclusion : the decaying behavior of a heavy muon does not suffer from divergence .",
    "by the term heavy muonwe mean so heavy a muon that it is not thermalized , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "the hot qed plasma means that the temperature @xmath4 of the plasma is much higher than the electron mass @xmath5 , @xmath6 . as discussed in sec .",
    "i , the infrared behavior of the theory is responsible for the divergent damping rate .",
    "thus , we employ the bloch - nordsieck approximation to the muon sector of the qed lagrangian .",
    "the lagrangian density is obtained@xcite by substituting a constant vector @xmath7 @xmath8 for @xmath9 in the muon sector of the standard qed lagrangian density : @xmath10 where @xmath11 , and @xmath12 stand , respectively , for heavy muon field , electron field , muon mass , electron mass and photon field .",
    "it is known that , in the infrared region , the spinor structure of the heavy muon does not play any significant roles@xcite .",
    "then the above lagrangian density well approximates the exact qed lagrangian in the infrared region .    to obtain the thermal two - point function of the heavy muon , we start from the euclidean or imaginary - time formalism of thermal field theory , initiated by matsubara@xcite , in which a time arrow flows from zero to @xmath13 in a complex time plane . in this formalism , the energy is discrete ; @xmath14 @xmath15 for a boson field and @xmath16 for a fermion field . at the final stage",
