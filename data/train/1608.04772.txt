    "the quest for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) takes on two forms : 1 ) direct observation of non - sm events in some kinematic region , and 2 ) indirect observation of non - sm interactions through a minute deviation of an observable from its sm value . in the former case ,",
    "a deviation from the expected distribution of a kinematic variable may be localized , e.g. a narrow peak in an invariant mass distribution , or it may appear as a broad feature that can only be detected on a statistical basis , such as an enhancement of the transverse momentum distribution of vector bosons due to an anomalous trilinear coupling . very often the researcher makes a histogram for a kinematic quantity and applies a statistical test for compatibility with the distribution expected from the sm alone . in this approach",
    "one hopes to know in advance which kinematic quantities will reveal new physics if it is present , and this requires insight and a fortunate choice of new physics model .",
    "different kinematic quantities are examined one at a time ; the researcher is effectively marginalizing over the other quantities in each case .",
    "sometimes multiple kinematic quantities are combined in a so - called multivariate analysis , and a single indicator variable is constructed that allows the researcher to exploit several kinematic quantities simultaneously ; this technique requires a model for the non - sm physics signal in order to optimize or train the indicator variable .",
    "multivariate techniques are nearly always tied to more or less specific models of new physics .",
    "we propose a method that stands between the extremes of histogramming individual quantities and constructing a highly - directed indicator variable .",
    "our method makes use of minimal spanning trees  ( mst ) constructed with events as they populate phase space .",
    "the distribution of events in phase space is determined by a production process followed by a decay process , which in turn are determined by the density of states and by matrix elements computed from an underlying fundamental theory .",
    "for example , values for the invariant mass  ( @xmath0 ) and transverse momentum  ( @xmath1 ) of muon pairs produced in the drell - yan process at a hadron collider are accurately generated based on sm calculations .",
    "the lhc experiments have carefully measured differential cross sections @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 for the inclusive production of same - flavor  @xcite , opposite - charge lepton pairs in pp  collisions , and these measurements confirm precise sm predictions .",
    "for example , a narrow peak for @xmath5  gev reflects the z  boson resonance , and the lepton pairs are produced more centrally as their invariant mass increases .",
    "these measurements do not attempt to probe correlations among kinematic variables , except perhaps to measure the differential cross section for one quantity in `` slices '' of another .",
    "correlations or other structures that may be present in phase space may be overlooked and are certainly not the goal of these measurements .",
    "the method we provide here is based on a construct that can preserve and reflect correlations or other structures in phase space .",
    "we hope this method may complement traditional differential cross section measurements and ultimately provide a new tool for identifying deviations from the sm that indicate new physics processes .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "first we define msts and describe their construction .",
    "second we briefly recall results from applications of msts to cosmological structure .",
    "third we analyze a set of values for one stochastic quantity in preparation for multi - dimensional cases  these we call one - dimensional `` trees . ''",
    "fourth we present a number of artificial examples that demonstrate in a dramatic fashion how msts can be sensitive to the way stochastic variables are distributed in a multidimensional space .",
    "fifth we illustrate the efficacy of msts for simulated dilepton events that might be observed at an lhc experiment .",
    "finally we summarize our exploratory results and conclude .",
    "the euclidean minimal spanning tree  ( mst ) is a graph connecting @xmath6 points in @xmath7 dimensions  @xcite .",
    "each point , called a `` vertex , '' is connected to at least one other via a line segment , called an `` edge , '' whose length is the euclidean distance between the two vertices it joins .",
    "the edges in the mst are chosen such that the sum of their lengths is minimized and that all @xmath6 vertices are connected ; that is , the tree is both minimal and spanning . by construction ,",
    "such a graph will have no closed loops or `` circuits . '' for any given set of vertices , there is a unique mst so long as no two pairs of vertices are separated by exactly equal distances .",
    "figure  [ fig : example ] shows a very simple mst with 20 vertices in two dimensions .          a number of algorithms to construct msts are available , the best known of which are prim s algorithm  @xcite and kruskal s algorithm  @xcite .",
    "we implemented kruskal s algorithm in c++ code written expressly for this study .",
    "given an mst , we can analyze its structure on a statistical basis .",
    "the lengths of the edges in the tree , which we will call @xmath8 , is perhaps the most intuitive mst quantity .",
    "the shape of the distribution of @xmath8 gives us an idea of the density and uniformity of the tree s vertices .",
    "the more sparsely the vertices are distributed in phase space , the greater the mean of the distribution of @xmath8 .",
    "furthermore , a tree with more variation in the density of its vertices will have a wider distribution of @xmath8 .    to compare the relative shapes of two trees ,",
    "the length of each edge divided by the average of its tree s edges is a more useful quantity .",
    "we will call it the `` normalized length '' and denote it @xmath9 , so @xmath10 .",
    "the distribution of the logarithm of this quantity , @xmath11 , is effective in distinguishing trees with different structures .",
    "another intuitive quantity is the number of edges attached to each vertex , called its `` degree '' or @xmath12 .",
    "a distribution of @xmath12 with a sharp peak at 2 signifies a tree with a filamentary structure , or longer `` branches . ''",
    "a `` branch '' is a chain of edges with a loose end , all connected via vertices of degree 2 .",
    "we will call the length of a branch @xmath13 and compare @xmath14 among the trees .    the quantities",
    "@xmath15 , and @xmath13 pertain to a single tree , and distributions of these quantities allow a comparison of two or more trees .",
    "in addition , we have devised quantities that relate to how two msts overlap in phase space .",
    "we introduce these quantities in section  [ sec : examples ] .",
    "the mst relies upon the spatial arrangement of events in phase space , which we must take into account when choosing which features to include .",
    "the first of these considerations is scaling .",
    "the mst uses euclidean distance , so the structure of the tree is sensitive to the units and range of each feature .",
    "if a single tree makes use of kinematic quantities which take varying units or differ greatly in their distribution , all features can be rescaled to prevent any single quantity from inappropriately guiding the analysis . in this paper",
    "we have constructed examples that do not require rescaling ; however , it might be necessary in a more general application .",
    "another consideration is the continuity of our feature space . as a distance - based method ,",
    "the mst is not suited to categorical or discrete features such as an integer number of jets .",
    "the inclusion of discretized features may have unexpected consequences , such as creating artificial filaments and branches in one of the dimensions .",
    "to our knowledge , one of the earliest applications of msts in a scientific analysis was reported by barrow , bhavsar , and sonoda in 1985  @xcite . at the time",
    ", the filamentary nature of the distribution of galaxies was becoming apparent and barrow et al",
    ".  wanted to find a tool that was sensitive to that filamentary structure .",
    "according to them , traditional statistical measures were not effective in identifying the filamentary structure and were insufficient for distinguishing competing models for galaxy formation .",
    "barrow et al",
    ".  took the available data on galaxy locations ( `` zwicky '' ) and constructed an mst . for comparison",
    ", they constructed a random grid of vertices ( `` poisson '' ) .",
    "their analysis is based on the fraction of edges of a given length in the mst after scaling by the mean length .",
    "the results show that the zwicky and the poisson msts have rather different structures .",
    "the number of nodes is modest ( slightly more than 1000 ) and the trees can be distinguished by inspection .",
    "more importantly , the distribution of the normalized edge lengths @xmath16 are quite different , proving that the distribution of galaxies through space has structure beyond that of a random distribution in space  the galaxies are more clustered .",
    "other analyses in astrophysics have employed msts .",
    "for example , campana et al .  employ them to identify sources of high - energy @xmath17  rays  @xcite .",
    "allison et al .  used msts to trace the segregation of mass ( the fact that massive stars are not distributed in the galaxy the same way as other stars )  @xcite .",
    "finally , macfarlane et al .  applied msts to chemical tagging of stellar debris  @xcite .",
    "these three applications are rather different , and do not have obvious analogs in particle physics .",
    "nonetheless , they show interesting advantages over more standard methods from which particle physics might profit .",
    "we begin with three simple examples for a one - dimensional `` tree . '' while a one - dimensional tree has very little structure , these examples nonetheless illustrate some statistical features that are important for our discussion .",
    "since the trees are almost trivial , it is easy to see the connection between the distribution of `` vertices '' and the distribution of edge lengths .",
    "suppose we have a set of @xmath18 values @xmath19 drawn from a given probability density function  ( pdf ) .",
    "they can be visualized as a set of vertices spread out along a line  a one - dimensional `` tree . ''",
    "if we put the values in ascending order , then the mst is simply the set of edges from one vertex to the next , starting from one end and ending at the other .",
    "the length of the `` tree '' is just the sum of the distances from one vertex to the next , which is the same as the length spanned by the tree : @xmath20 .",
    "there is only one branch , and that branch contains all vertices connected one to the next ; all vertices have degree two except the first and the last .",
    "the only quantity of interest is the edge length , @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ) , or quantities derived from it . in this section",
    "we focus only on the distribution of @xmath23 .",
    "we consider three illustrative cases , all of them defined for the interval @xmath24 .",
    "the first case is just the uniform distribution , with pdf @xmath25 .",
    "the second is sharply peaked toward the origin : @xmath26 .",
    "the third function is multi - modal with a region where vertices are suppressed : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is a normalization constant .",
    "example trees of these three distributions are shown in fig .",
