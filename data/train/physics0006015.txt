    "b - lymphocytes carry on their surface highly specific receptors , so - called antibodies . if these receptors detect complementary structures , the lymphocyte is stimulated to proliferate and after several generations and differentation into plasma cells secretes antibodies of the same specificity .",
    "b - lymphocytes and antibodies of a given specificity are said to have a certain idiotype .",
    "complementary structures to an idiotype are antigen or other , anti - idiotypic antibodies . between b - lymphocytes of different idiotype",
    "thus emerges a functional network of mutual stimulation and inhibition , the idiotypic network @xcite .",
    "the idiotypic network is supposed to at least partially contribute to the functionality of the immune system as , e.g. , immunological memory or suppression of autoreactive clones .",
    "though quantitative data are very hard to access by experiment there are some recent observations which underline the importance of idiotypic interactions @xcite .",
    "new idiotypes are produced in the bone marrow or due to hypermutation during the proliferation of stimulated lymphocytes which introduces a random metadynamics of the repertoire . at a given moment",
    "the random network has a certain architecture .",
    "the aim of this paper is to give a statistical description of this architecture .",
    "knowledge of the typical architecture of the idiotypic network is crucial for describing the population dynamics of the interacting b - lymphocytes and antibodies , cf .",
    "@xcite , which is however not the subject of this paper .    derived from hypotheses of theoretical immunology ( cf .",
    "@xcite , for a recent review see @xcite ) we present a statistical analysis of bit - string based networks , which shows , that this approach is well suited to reproduce reasonable network structures .",
    "especially , our considerations show , that realistic network topologies can be conceived as an extension of first approaches to that problem which assumed a bethe - lattice structure .",
    "suggestions of how loops should be added to such structures have been made previously @xcite .",
    "for this , our work provides a very natural access .",
    "generally , idiotypic networks are supposed to realize a tradeoff between two basic requirements : they should contain a great number of small isolated components , but on the other hand still be able to respond to arbitrary antigen , that means being complete .",
    "small components are thought necessary to store information about previously encountered antigen @xcite .",
    "the existence of such components does obviously demand a low connectivity of the network . with completeness on the other hand it is assumed that of a great number of antibodies each is able to detect many different types of antigen .",
    "hence the network connectivity should not be too low .    with regard to the underlying biological problem the one great ",
    "many small clusters situation is thus worthwhile to earn special attention .",
    "theoretical immunologists suppose that the idiotypic network should consist of a large number of small clusters . on the other hand , as a consequence of relatively high connectivities ,",
    "also a large component should be contained within the idiotypic network , which is denoted as its central part .",
    "this great cluster could play an important role in the control of autoreactive clones @xcite .    in the following the bit - string model of @xcite",
    "will be explained briefly .",
    "basically , antibodies are identified with bit chains of a given length @xmath0 .",
    "thus , there are @xmath2 different antibody types .",
    "the set of all conceivable antibodies , i.e. the potential repertoire , is then represented by @xmath3 . estimating the probable size of networks that can be complete in the above sense shows that @xmath4 should be a good value for realistic models @xcite .",
    "antibodies recognize each other if they have complementary structures , i.e. if they are represented by perfectly complementary bit strings .",
    "if there are small deviations from the exact structural complementarity a matching is still possible , though with lower affinity .",
    "this is described by so - called matching rules .",
    "for example we imagine that antibodies react if the respective structures are complementary except one small region .",
    "using the language of our model the corresponding bit - strings should be inverse except one bit that belongs to the non - complementary region .",
    "we call this kind of rule a one - mismatch rule . two - mismatch rules , which allow reactions between antibodies that are complementary up to two non - matching regions , are accordingly defined by connecting bit - strings that are complementary with two exceptions allowed .",
    "naturally , the multitude of possible rules is not exhausted by mismatch rules .",
    "rules that express matching of mutually shifted antibody parts could be conceived as well .",
    "for the sake of simplicity this work is confined to those matching rules that are associated with reactions of highest affinity , i.e. inversion , one- and two - mismatch rules .",
    "mathematically , the set of all antibody types ( represented by bit - strings or vertices of a hypercube ) together with all possible reactions between them defines a graph .",
    "thus , we want to call @xmath5 the one - mismatch base graph and @xmath6 the two - mismatch base graph , respectively . to obtain a better impression of one - mismatch graphs",
    "they can be compared to hypercubes of the same dimension .",
    "looking , e.g. , on hypercubes of dimension @xmath7 edges of one - mismatch graphs are represented by all space and side diagonals .",
    "this , together with a picture of an one - mismatch graph in dimension @xmath8 is shown in figs .",
    "[ cube ] and [ smallgraph ] , respectively .    the actual repertoire ,",
    "i.e. the set of all types of idiotypes that are really existing within the body at a given time , is a subset of the potential repertoire .",
    "there are profound reasons to believe that the actual repertoire should be distributed randomly within the potential repertoire @xcite . a way of realizing this is to choose antibodies with a certain probability @xmath1",
    ". then the idiotypic network is represented by the random graph that is composed of all occupied vertices ( antibodies ) and their connections ( possible reactions ) . clearly , this is a site percolation problem @xcite .",
    "percolation problems on standard lattices are far away from beeing a new field of research .",
    "percolation on one - mismatch graphs , however , bears some major difference to ordinary percolation .",
    "percolation is always connected to an abrupt change of some system property ( the standard property is the existence of a connecting path from the upper to the lower boundary on 2-dimensional lattices ) if the occupation probability passes a certain value , the percolation threshold .",
    "this transition becomes sharp in the limit of infinite systems .",
    "on lattices there is no question how to increase the system size to infinity .",
    "however , sequences of one - mismatch graphs exhibit relations between small and large systems that are essentially different from similar characteristics of lattices which are created by the multiplication of a unit cell .",
    "understanding of these distinctions comes from studying the structure of fully occupied one - mismatch graphs ( base graphs ) which will be performed in the ensuing section .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the architecture of functional networks built by constituents of randomly generated characteristics interacting with complementary constituents .",
    "our motivation , the formulation of the problem and the interpretation of the results are all in the context of modeling the immune system using language and methods of statistical physics .",
    "however , our results are essentially independent of the specific immunological interpretation and could be of broader interest .",
    "the situation of interacting randomly generated complementary constituents is quite general .",
    "for example think of chemical reactions ( origin of life ) , ecosystems , social networks .    generally , the conception of the paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii topological properties of base - graphs will be studied .",
    "section iii gives an analysis of the underlying percolation problem , which then leads , together with applications of random graph theory from sec .",
    "iv and a study of intrinsic structures of great clusters in sec .",
    "v , to conclusions about parameter regimes , in which bit - string model induced random graphs resemble idiotypic networks . in the appendix another method to calculate thresholds via the renormalization of small cells will be discussed .",
    "the above definition of matching rules allows an easy calculation of distances between vertices of @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 be vertices , @xmath11 their hamming distance ( i.e. the number of different bits between them ) and @xmath12 where @xmath13 denotes the length of a path @xmath14 , a metrics .",
    "then it holds that if @xmath15 which shows that the maximum distance @xmath16 between vertices is roughly the half of that on ordinary hypercubes .",
    "this is essentially due to the inversion rule .",
    "furthermore , it should be noticed that @xmath16 does not change when increasing the dimension by one from odd ( @xmath17 ) to even ( @xmath18 ) values .    to obtain additional information about the toplogy",
    "we distinguish vertices corresponding to their distance @xmath19 to an arbitrarily chosen origin , e.g. @xmath20 , whose choice is arbitrary due to the specific construction - rule of base graphs .",
    "we denote the set of vertices with distance @xmath21 from @xmath22 by @xmath23 applying ( [ eq1 ] ) it is possible to compute the number of vertices @xmath24 belonging to @xmath25 ( mass distribution ) by simple combinatorics to @xmath26    a visualization of eq .",
    "( [ eq3 ] ) in fig .",
    "[ pic1 ] shows a major difference between odd and even dimensions @xmath0 .",
    "generally , @xmath24 grows monotonically with increasing distance . for odd dimensions",
    ", however , the number of vertices with maximal distance @xmath27 from @xmath22 is substantially smaller than that with distance @xmath28    differences in the overall structure of graphs in odd and even dimensions @xmath0 become even more obvious if the number of links connecting vertices of the same set @xmath25 is considered . using ( [ eq1 ] ) , a somewhat lengthy but straightforward calculation shows that connected vertices in the same distance @xmath19 from the origin @xmath22 occur in @xmath29 analogously , the number of links that connect vertices of @xmath25 with vertices belonging to @xmath30 may be computed to @xmath31 for @xmath32 .    as a consequence there must exist loops of even as well as of odd length .",
    "moreover , all short loops with length less than @xmath0 must be even ( since only loops comprising links between vertices in the same distance from any loop element can be of an odd length ) .",
    "an important property of standard systems in percolation theory is that the smaller system is always contained within the larger one . for one - mismatch graphs , however , this is not possible .",
    "let @xmath33 be dimensions of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively . if @xmath34 were contained in @xmath35 it would follow directly that @xmath35 should have uneven loops with length less then @xmath36 .",
    "this gives a contradiction since @xmath35 contains no odd loops smaller than @xmath37 , whereas @xmath33 by assumption .",
    "resuming these results we state that percolation on one mismatch graphs differs from standard percolation . a crucial point for this distinction",
    "is the way how global system properties change if the system size approaches infinity .",
    "nevertheless , methods of percolation theory can be applied to this kind of problem .",
    "even more , choosing an appropriate majority rule renormalization group procedures can be extended to one - mismatch - graphs ( see appendix a ) .    to the best of our present knowledge percolation problems on graphs with similar properties have not been dealt with .",
    "even percolation on regular hypercubes has found relatively little attention in the physical literature @xcite .",
    "having collected some simple properties of the underlying base graphs we consider now vertices of that graphs occupied with a given probability @xmath1 .",
    "the set of all occupied vertices @xmath38 together with all bonds , which connect two vertices belonging to @xmath38 forms a random graph . in terms of percolation theory a maximal set of connected vertices",
    "is called cluster .",
    "what is the probability that an arbitrarily chosen vertex belongs to a cluster of size @xmath39 ?",
    "this question has already been addressed in @xcite where three major regimes of the system have been identified ( see also the numerical results in fig . [ picsim1 ] ) :    \\(i ) the first typical situation arises for small values of the occupation probability @xmath1",
    ". then only small clusters ( whose individual size does nt make up a finite fraction of the whole system ) are expected to appear .",
    "\\(ii ) increasing @xmath1 and approaching infinite dimensions , a sharp transition ( in the sequel denoted as percolation transition ) to an one great cluster ",
    "many small clusters regime was found . at the percolation transition",
    "some characteristics obey scaling laws .",
    "these and an approximation to compute percolation thresholds will be dealt with in sec .",
    "the one great  many small clusters situation is worthwhile to earn special attention ( cf .",
    "i ) . the great cluster could play an important role in the control of autoreactive clones . to fulfill that purpose",
    "it is believed to have a certain internal structure ( cf .",
    "@xcite , for experimental data cf .",
    "@xcite ) , which will be discussed in more detail in sec . vi .",
    "thus , as stated already in @xcite the simple one  parametric bit chain model exhibits an interesting similarity to the idiotypic network .",
    "\\(iii ) finally , if the occupation probability is further increased , a state where random graphs consist of one connected component only will be reached .",
    "relying on some general results of the theory of random graphs it can be shown that this indeed marks a second ( in the limit of infinite systems ) sharp transition which we call denseness transition . in sec .",
    "v these considerations are resumed and discussed with reference to the completeness of the immune system .",
    "exactly the same two thresholds have been considered earlier for a different class of random graphs @xcite and more recently in the context of networks of rna secondary structures @xcite .",
    "a common method to analyze percolation problems is the introduction of perimeter polynomials @xmath40 . using the standard notation we define @xmath41 where @xmath42 denotes the probability that a vertex on the base graph belongs to a cluster of size @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath43 means the free surface , i.e. the set of all unoccupied vertices of the base graph that are adjacent to vertices of @xmath44 .    generally , there are few problems which allow the explicit calculation of @xmath40 for arbitrary cluster size @xmath39 .",
    "notwithstanding , it is always possible to compute @xmath40 for small values of @xmath39 .",
    "this provides a basis for the application of series expansion techniques .",
    "we investigate the structure of small clusters up to size @xmath45 on one - mismatch - graphs . as a result for large base graphs ( @xmath46 )",
    "we find the following perimeter polynomials for one - mismatch - graphs @xmath47 where @xmath48 .    in the following",
    "we show that in the limit of high dimensions random graphs on one - mismatch - graphs for small values of @xmath1 are very similar to random graphs on bethe - lattices with the same coordination number .",
    "arguments of this kind have already been applied to percolation on hypercubic lattices @xcite making use of the fact that loops in random graphs on sparsely occupied high dimensional lattices are infrequent .",
    "indeed , the first terms of a high dimension expansion on a hypercubic lattice of dimension @xmath0 are given by the exact values of the percolation threshold for the bethe - lattice with coordination number @xmath0 .",
    "a closer look at the perimeter polynomials ( [ u1]-[u5 ] ) supports the hypothesis that the situation is quite similar for one - mismatch - graphs .",
    "for example , the contribution from loops to @xmath49 is given by @xmath50 .",
    "obviously , the relative weight of this term vanishes in the high dimension limit .",
    "additional support comes from the observation that the one - mismatch base - graph @xmath9 contains hypercubes up to dimension @xmath51 . to elucidate this property we consider the following example in @xmath52 .",
    "we construct a hypercube of dimension @xmath53 applying the one - mismatch rule allowing for a mismatch in one of the , e.g. , last three bits .",
    "starting for instance at the origin @xmath54 this yields @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 .",
    "iteration gives the new vertices @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and finally @xmath61 .",
    "these @xmath62 vertices are connected by the matching rules like a 3-dimensional hypercube .",
    "then follow the arguments of @xcite .",
    "consequently the percolation threshold for one - mismatch - graphs can be approximated to @xmath63 whereas for two - mismatch graphs holds @xmath64 corrections to ( [ pc1 ] ) and ( [ pc2 ] ) are of order @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively . from considerations of sec .",
    "i we find that the number of links connecting vertices in @xmath25 with vertices in @xmath30 decreases with growing distance @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the corrections to @xmath67 must be positive .",
    "typically for percolation problems , certain system characteristics obey scaling laws at the percolation threshold .",
    "this kind of laws reflects the statistical self similarity of clusters on different length scales in that parameter regime . fig .",
    "[ abbu ] displays simulation results for the cluster size distributions obtained for one - mismatch - graphs of dimensions @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "both data sets can be well described by the finite size scaling ansatz @xmath70 where the function @xmath71 is nearly a constant for @xmath72 and will be more rapidly declining than any power law for arguments @xmath73 .",
    "equation ( [ scale ] ) should apply for clusters which are neither too small nor too large .",
    "due to the limited size of the investigated systems , very large clusters behave in a different way than clusters of ` standard ' size .",
    "the transition between the laws applying to these separate cases is marked by @xmath74 , which in turn depends on the extent of the system .",
    "analogous properties can be observed for base graphs defined by other matching rules .",
    "figure [ abbu ] illustrates scaling behaviour for the case of graphs diced on two - mismatch - base graphs for values of @xmath75 cf .",
    "( [ pc2 ] ) . as a natural consequence of adding supplementary edges distances between vertices will become smaller in comparison to one - mismatch - graphs .",
    "this gives an explanation for the fact , that typical sizes @xmath74 are substantially smaller than those examined on one - mismatch - graphs with the same choice of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ abbu ] that the scaling law ( [ scale ] ) even well applies to very small clusters .",
    "it is useful to define a cluster size dependent exponent @xmath76 by @xmath77 evaluating the perimeter polynomials ( [ u1])-([u5 ] ) , values of @xmath76 for small @xmath39 can be derived .",
    "thus we obtain a sequence @xmath78 which should approach the true value of @xmath79 for large @xmath39 .    as a matter of fact ( [ scale ] )",
    "changes to @xmath80 in the limit of infinite systems . performing the limits @xmath81 in eqs .",
    "( [ u1])-([u5 ] ) and ( [ tau ] ) , we observe that @xmath82 obeys @xmath83 which by comparison of ( [ tau ] ) with ( [ tauf ] ) and solving the recursion relation implies the law @xmath84 for the cluster size distribution .",
    "equation ( [ tauf ] ) leads to @xmath85 for large clusters .",
    "the thus computed value @xmath86 is in accord with the exact result on the bethe - lattice .",
    "since we investigate a model for a biological system our main interest is devoted to large , yet finite systems . in the sequence",
    "@xmath87 our best approximation for the real value of @xmath79 is @xmath88 .",
    "a comparison between values of @xmath79 computed by @xmath89 and exponents @xmath79 obtained by evaluating numerical data for small systems suggests that the involved approximation becomes rapidly more accurate if the system size is increased .",
    "hence in @xmath90 we rely on @xmath88 and find @xmath91 , which gives a result that also supports the previous assumption .",
    "subsequently it was our aim to find a quantity which gives an overall estimation of deviations between random graphs on one - mismatch - graphs from those on bethe - lattices of equal coordination number .",
    "for this purpose it appears appropriate to investigate the results of an edge elimination procedure which computes the number of bonds belonging to loops .",
    "similar procedures have very recently @xcite been applied to lattices .",
    "the above aim is achieved by individually removing every edge of every cluster and calculating the number of the connected components of the resulting graph .",
    "an edge is called fractioning if two components are obtained cutting this edge .",
    "clearly , only edges that belong to loops are not fractioning",
    ".    then the ratio of fractioning bonds @xmath92 to the overall number of bonds @xmath93 of a cluster @xmath44 , @xmath94 , is some indication for the importance of loops within the structure of @xmath44 .",
    "distinguishing clusters according to their size @xmath39 we computed the mean fractioning ratio @xmath95 except for very small clusters with trivial structure we expect a finite size scaling law @xmath96 for the fragmentation rate @xmath97 at the percolation threshold , the validity of which is illustrated in fig .",

    "bonds are the 4-loop ( no fractioning bond ) and the 4-loop with a tail ( @xmath99 of all bonds fractioning ) which give the contributions @xmath100 and @xmath101 to @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively . making use of ( [ u4 ] ) and ( [ u5 ] )",
    "we then find @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "finally , inserting @xmath106 a rough estimate for @xmath107 is @xmath108 which gives    @xmath109    for @xmath110 we have @xmath111 in very good agreement with the numerically obtained value @xmath112 , cf .",
    "[ fragrate ] . for @xmath90",
    "we find @xmath113 already very close to @xmath114 which holds for bethe - lattices .",
    "thus the value @xmath115 measured on finite dimensional random graphs on one - mismatch base - graphs  which is caused by a small number of loops  should quantify the deviation from random graphs on bethe - lattices .",
    "it appears that the occupation probability at the percolation threshold is still small enough to apply the bethe approximation .    yet ,",
    "random graphs at @xmath116 are not exactly bethe  like and contain a certain fraction of loops .",
    "otherwise it would be impossible to distinguish subclusters according to their connectivity within any considerable connected component .",
    "this , however , is likely to be necessary , to explain the role of the central part of idiotypic networks properly @xcite .",
    "further investigations concerning the structure of great clusters will be made in sec .",
    "hitherto , our main interest was devoted to the question at which occupation probability a great cluster starts to exist .",
    "if @xmath1 , however , is further increased it is also imaginable that a situation occurs , where the whole system consists of one great cluster only .",
    "this is referred to as the question about the connectivity property of random graphs .    in the theory of random graphs",
    "some general results that address related problems have been derived for so called sequences of configuration spaces @xcite and earlier for a different general class of random graphs in @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the sequence of one - mismatch - base graphs @xmath117 fulfills all requirements of these configurations spaces @xcite , due to its rather technical nature the proof will be omitted here .",
    "general results of @xcite can be applied here showing that for infinite systems there exists a threshold @xmath118 ( @xmath119 being the coordination number ) with the property that almost all random graphs are connected for @xmath120 while the set of all connected random graphs has measure zero for @xmath121 .    moreover , for sequences of configuration spaces it holds that both the connectivity and the density treshold , i.e. the threshold for the property that there is no non - occupied site without occupied neighbours on the base graph , coincide . using ( [ eq31 ] ) we find @xmath122 in case of one - mismatch - graphs and @xmath123 for two - mismatch graphs .",
    "density of random graphs in our model can be directly translated into biological terms . since antibodies and antigens",
    "are represented by the same sets of bit chains the property that there is no free site without occupied neighbour means that every antigen is sure to encounter a complementary antibody .",
    "hence the idiotypic network is able to respond to any antigen .",
    "this is meant by the completeness axiom @xcite for the immune system .",
    "nevertheless it is somewhat difficult to reconcile the demands for denseness of random graphs and occurance of small clusters at the same time .",
    "however , it seems unlikely that completeness should be understood in this strict way .",
    "rather it appears to be a better solution to consider the fact , that evolution has most likely driven the idiotypic network into such a kind of arrangement , that it is able to respond to variations of really existing antigen only .",
    "thus we argue that completeness of the idiotypic network does not exactly match density of random graphs , but requires only the probability for the density of the corresponding random graph to be somewhat below @xmath124 .",
    "so , random graphs could still comprise small clusters and be complete .",
    "another paradoxon arises if two - mismatch graphs are considered . for those the connectivity and percolation thresholds @xmath125 and @xmath126 fall together .",
    "how could then small clusters and a seperate great component coexist if all random graphs are connected ? yet , for the case of finite systems it is clear that @xmath127 , i.e. a great cluster has to be formed first , before it can devour his competing small rivals .",
    "consequently , also for the case of two - mismatch - graphs the biologically interesting regime is well defined . for finite systems",
    "there is a range of occupation probabilities @xmath128 , where all requirements are met . due to the fact that both probabilities @xmath129 and @xmath130 are converging to zero in the limit @xmath131",
    "it follows that the extent of this range @xmath132 will also become very small for large systems .    in the next section",

    "therefrom further conclusions about biologically relevant parameter regimes can be drawn .",

    "i - iv two phase transitions have been found to occur . the ranges below @xmath116 ( since there is no great cluster ) and above @xmath133 ( since there is only one great cluster )",

    "ii ) . in this section further investigations into the network structure within this parameter regime will be made .",
    "insights into the structure of a great cluster can be obtained from the mass distribution of this cluster @xmath134 , i.e. the information , how many vertices have a certain distance @xmath19 from a starting point @xmath135 . due to the equality of all starting points",
    "@xmath135 we define @xmath136 and consider the mean value of @xmath137 calculated over all clusters , whose size exceeds a minimum value @xmath138 .",

    "we will discuss some typical cluster compositions to obtain a survey of possible conclusions from mass distributions to cluster structures .",
    "basically , three different situations could be imagined ( for ( i ) and ( iii ) see fig .",
    "[ picturesque ] ) .",
    "\\(i ) a cluster could consist of some loosely clinged high connectivity regions ( heaps ) , whose vertices are distinguished by a great number of connections with each other .",
    "other vertices are bound with relatively few links .",
    "clearly , strong connectivity within heaps means , that vertices belonging to them have nearly the same distance from all other vertices .",
    "thus , the presence of many heaps should result in a great number of local extrema , caused by ` looking from all heaps ' to each other . on the other hand , loosely bound vertices will smooth the mass distribution , i.e. reduce the sharpness of extrema .",
    "\\(ii ) a cluster could contain no distinguished parts at all . from ( [ eq3 ] )",
    "we know that till @xmath144 the number of vertices is increasing with the distance @xmath19 . for small occupation probabilities",
    "@xmath121 ( for which not the whole base - graph has been ` conquered ' yet ) we expect a compromise between with @xmath19 declining probabilities that a vertex of that cluster has distance @xmath19 from an origin @xmath22 and the increasing number of vertices with @xmath19 .",
    "consequently , the mass distribution should exhibit one maximum . for large @xmath120 mass distributions",
    "can simply be derived by multiplying ( [ eq3 ] ) with @xmath1 .",
    "\\(iii ) as a special case of ( i ) a cluster could be made of one heap and a certain fraction of loosely bound vertices .",
    "then up to two maxima , caused by the heaped vertex concentration and the competing tendencies ( see ( ii ) ) , respectively , are likely to occur .",
    "the sharpness of both maxima will depend on the fraction of the loosely bound vertices .",
    "thus , in case of a large proportion of those vertices both extrema could be smoothened to just one broad maximum .",
    "[ simpic8 ] shows simulation results for the normalized mass distribution for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "clearly , all distributions are marked by only one maximum , whose sharpness is increasing with growing values of @xmath1 . in the vicinity of the density threshold clusters",
    "are already stretched over the whole extent of the base graph .",
    "hence , for @xmath145 slightly below @xmath146 the curve of the mass distribution looks similar to the exactly known distribution for the fully occupied base - graph given by eq .",

    ".    more interestingly , for small @xmath1 s in the vicinity of the percolation threshold relatively broad maxima occur , which could be an indication for cluster structures as described in ( iii ) .    to prove the validity of this hypothesis we have applied the edge - elimination algorithm ( see sec .",
    "ii ) to great clusters . as a slight extension of the described procedure",
    "all fractioning edges are removed , thus splitting a cluster @xmath44 into the sequence of its doubly connected components , or heaps in the above sense , @xmath147 .",
    "obviously , vertices belonging to doubly connected components are distinguished by their strong cliquishness in comparison to other vertices .",
    "thus , the number of such components @xmath148 should allow to distinguish between the situations ( i)-(iii ) .",
    "[ teilmw ] shows simulation data for the mean value @xmath149 of the resulting non - trivial parts after edge - elimination depending on @xmath1 .",
    "the distribution is marked by one maximum , which is again a consequence of two competing tendencies . for small values of @xmath1 clusters",
    "are generally not doubly connected , but increasing @xmath1 leads to a larger proportion of vertices that belong to loops . on the other hand , there is a tendency that loops get connected by loops , i.e. , seperate doubly connected cluster components are growing together .",
    "thus , for large @xmath1 almost every cluster will consist of one doubly connected component only .",
    "results of fig .",
    "[ teilmw ] show also that the maximum is reached slighly above the percolation threshold @xmath116 .",
    "then , the number of doubly connected parts @xmath148 is rapidly declining till it asymptotically approaches @xmath150 for @xmath151 . we argue that this behaviour is caused by one great doubly connected component which occurs first for some @xmath152 and then gradually incorporates all other doubly connected parts . in principle , these results do also apply to two - mismatch graphs ( see fig .",
    "[ teilmw1 ] ) .    comparing this with the above",
    "described scenario of cluster structures , we can thus state that there is a range of values of @xmath152 where ( iii ) applies , i.e. clusters are made of one great doubly connected component ( including several small ones ) and a set of other loosley bound vertices .",
    "accordingly , within this range of @xmath1 we define two subsets of great clusters @xmath44 , namely the great doubly connected component @xmath153 and the complementary set @xmath154 .    as already discussed in sec .",
    "i , the central part of idiotypic networks ( corresponding to great clusters @xmath44 ) should contain strongly and weakly connected distinguished subsets . from the previous analysis it becomes clear ,",
    "that there is a choice of the only parameter @xmath1 , where bit - string models can exactly reproduce such a situation .",
    "we investigated statistical properties of a bit - string based model for idiotypic networks and compared typical architectures of the thus defined network with axioms and hypotheses for idiotypic networks from theoretical biology . before introducing randomness we undertook an analysis of the underlying base graphs to show a major difference to standard percolation problems which bases on the way how the size of the system is increased .    in the following the expressed antibody repertoire",
    "was identified with graphs , created by randomly occupying a matching rule defined base structure ( base graphs ) .",
    "concepts of percolation theory have been applied in order to determine the percolation threshold .",
    "the immune system is a very large , yet finite system .",
    "consequently , finite size corrections have to be taken in account .",
    "series expansion techniques allowed the calculation of two critical exponents ( for finite systems and in the limit @xmath81 ) that characterize the scaling behaviour .",
    "a regime of values for the parameter @xmath155 has been found where random graphs consist of many small clusters and one great connected component . for choices @xmath152 our model",
    "reproduces the peripheral / central part conception for idiotypic networks .",
    "the translation of the notation of the completeness of idiotypic networks into the language of graph theory allowed the determination of an upper threshold @xmath156 for the occurance of the many small clusters  one great cluster situation . furthermore , relying on general results of the theory of random graphs ( for so - called sequences of configuration spaces ) we calculated the  in this case coinciding  thresholds for the density ( @xmath156 ) and the connectivity ( @xmath133 ) properties .",
    "furthermore , we developed techniques to obtain additional information about the structure of great clusters .",
    "analysing random graphs for @xmath152 great clusters can be decomposed into two subsets of vertices with different binding properties , namely groups of doubly connected vertices ( backbone ) and loosely linked vertices ( peripheral part of the great cluster ) .",
    "thus , bit - string models are suited to describe a hierarchy of connectivity levels , that really existing idiotypic networks are also expected to exhibit .",
    "our results support to some extent idealized architectures used in a mean field type model to describe the dynamics of the central part of the immune system @xcite .",
    "contrary to other model approaches @xcite for topologies of idiotypic networks our simple few parametric bit - string model produces a non - trivial seemingly realistic network topology , without assuming a priori distinguished vertex groups .",
    "in this appendix we want to present a method to approximate the connectivity threshold for one - mismatch - graphs .",
    "the extension of ideas of the renormalization group theory could also be applicable to more complicated cases which do not allow an exact treatment .",
    "our approach bases on the idea of the renormalization of small cells @xcite which employs the self similarity of the system on different length scales at the percolation threshold .",
    "a condition to apply this procedure is that an appropriate grouping of sites on the original lattice leads to a renormalized lattice with the same symmetry properties as the original one . here , treating not a real space lattice but functional networks ,",
    "we adapt the idea of the renormalization group theory in the following way .",
    "we find a transformation @xmath157 which , by grouping of vertices , leads from the one - mismatch base graph @xmath158 in dimension @xmath159 to a graph @xmath160 which is equivalent to the base graph @xmath9 in dimension @xmath0 , @xmath161 , thus allowing a systematic reduction of the degrees of freedom .    if a  for finite systems appropriately defined ",
    "threshold property , namely @xmath162 , converges to a certain value for @xmath81 , differences between @xmath163 and @xmath164 must be small and will disappear in the limit of infinite systems .",
    "consequently , if a grouping of vertices to super vertices on a graph @xmath165 yields a renormalized graph @xmath166 of the same type , percolation thresholds on both graphs will be the same .",
    "thus , we replace the term symmetry ( as it is applied to lattices ) by equivalency of graphs .",
    "we encode an arbitrary vertex of the base graph @xmath158 by @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a bit chain of length @xmath0 and @xmath169 , @xmath170 are single bits .",
    "every vertex on @xmath158 belongs to a unique 4-loop @xmath171 connected by one - mismatch links .",
    "the renormalization @xmath157 replaces this 4-loop by the  supervertex @xmath172 on @xmath160 ( of course the choice of @xmath173 leads to identical results ) .",
    "if two vertices @xmath168 and @xmath174 are connected by an inversion ( one - mismatch ) link on @xmath9 the vertices of the corresponding 4-loops on @xmath158 are connected by 4 inversion ( one - mismatch ) links , too , cf .",
    "[ anh1 ] .      to describe random graphs we apply the following majority rule : a super vertex on @xmath9",
    "is considered as occupied if at least two connected vertices of the corresponding 4-loop on @xmath158 are occupied , i.e. this 4-loop is said to percolate . on the basis of this rule we obtain @xmath175where @xmath176 denotes the ( renormalized ) probability that vertices of @xmath177 are occupied if vertices on @xmath165 were diced with probability @xmath1 .    calculating fixed points of eq .",
    "( [ ren1 ] ) we obtain @xmath178 , @xmath179 , and @xmath124 .",
    "thus , as the only unstable solution in @xmath180 $ ] we have @xmath181 as a first approximation for the connectivity threshold .    at this place one could pose the question whether only 4-loops are suited as a renormalization cell . indeed , it is also possible to summarize successive renormalization steps to a single great one , ordinary hypercubes of even dimension @xmath182 form suitable cells as well . on the other hand ,",
    "condensing odd dimensional hypercubes to super vertices does not lead to renormalized graphs @xmath166 that are equivalent to other base graphs of the sequence @xmath183 .",
    "altogether , this seems to be an effect of differences between even and odd - dimensional base graphs ( see sec .",
    "of course , renormalizing small cells entails some approximation .",
    "grouping together vertices and applying a majority rule to occupy the renormalized vertices , situations can arise where clusters on the original lattice are cut or new clusters are formed @xcite .",
    "there are different approaches to improve the involved approximations .",
    "one possibility suggested in @xcite which leads to exact results in the limit of very large cells is to summarize some elementary cells to one large cell of size @xmath184 .",
    "this large cell will then be occupied if all elementary cells are occupied and connected , i.e. are said to percolate . since renormalization faults",
    "are essentially due to cell surface effects improvements produced by the above method emanate from the declining surface - volume ratio of large cells .",
    "for one - mismatch graphs it holds , however , that the surface size of a cell @xmath185 depends logarithmically on @xmath184 , viz .",
    "@xmath186 leading to only slight improvements with increasing @xmath184 .    using larger elementary cells",
    "consisting of two coupled 4-loops we obtain @xmath187 using four coupled 4-loops yields @xmath188 where @xmath48 . as fixed points @xmath189 of ( [ ren2 ] ) and ( [ ren3 ] ) we determined numerically @xmath190 and @xmath191 , respectively .",
    "the difference of both values to @xmath192 may be a consequence of the above mentioned slow convergence .",
    "more interestingly , our renormalization procedure of replacing hypercubes of dimension @xmath193 by super vertices is without modifications applicable to ordinary hypercubes as well .",
    "this gives an additional argument that the connectivity thresholds of both sequences of graphs are equal which can also be verified by evaluating eq .",
