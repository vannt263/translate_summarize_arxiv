    "let us identify the symmetric group @xmath0 with its right cayley graph , as generated by the conjugacy class of transpositions .",
    "furthermore , let us equip @xmath0 with the edge - labelling in which each edge corresponding to the transposition @xmath1 is marked with @xmath2 , the larger of the two numbers interchanged .",
    "a restricted version of this labelling was introduced by stanley @xcite as an el - labelling of the noncrossing partition lattice @xmath3 related to parking functions ; it was subsequently ported to the symmetric group by biane @xcite using a natural embedding @xmath4 .",
    "figure [ fig : cayley ] shows @xmath5 together with the biane ",
    "stanley edge labelling : @xmath6-edges are drawn in blue , @xmath7-edges in yellow , and @xmath8-edges in red . in general , we will refer to the edge labels of @xmath0 as _",
    "colours_.     @xmath5 with the biane ",
    "stanley edge - labelling ( figure by m. lacroix ) . ]    a walk on @xmath0 is said to be _ monotone _ if the colours of the edges it traverses form a weakly increasing sequence .",
    "once this notion has been introduced , a natural question is to count monotone walks of a given length between two given permutations .",
    "it turns out that this question , which is of a purely combinatorial nature , is closely connected to certain problems in analysis .",
    "in particular , it is known @xcite that , for any @xmath9 and any @xmath10 , one has    @xmath11    where the integration is against the haar probability measure on the compact group of @xmath12 complex unitary matrices @xmath13_{i , j=1}^n$ ] , and @xmath14 is the number of @xmath15-step monotone walks on @xmath0 from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "it is a non - obvious fact that the number @xmath14 , and hence the integral in , depends on the permutations @xmath16 and @xmath17 only through the cycle type of @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , as explained in @xcite , the formula implies that the computation of inner products of homogeneous polynomial functions of degree @xmath19 in the hilbert space @xmath20 is equivalent to the enumeration of monotone walks on @xmath0 .",
    "the computation of such inner products is important in various parts of mathematical physics , including lattice quantum chromodynamics @xcite and string theory @xcite , and from this perspective serves as a kind of feynman diagram expansion .",
    "polynomial integrals on @xmath21 are also ubiquitous in random matrix theory , where in the course of various moment computations it is necessary to `` integrate out '' eigenvector data to get at the eigenvalue distribution of a unitarily invariant random matrix .",
    "another perspective on the problem of enumerating monotone walks on @xmath0 is to consider it as a desymmetrization of the _",
    "double hurwitz problem _ from enumerative algebraic geometry . given two partitions @xmath22 , and a nonnegative integer @xmath23 ,",
    "let @xmath24 denote the total number of @xmath25-step walks on @xmath0 , not necessarily monotone , which begin at a permutation of cycle type @xmath26 , end at a permutation of cycle type @xmath27 , and have the property that their steps and endpoints together generate a transitive subgroup of @xmath0 .",
    "the numbers @xmath24 are known as the _",
    "double hurwitz numbers _ because , by a classical construction due to hurwitz @xcite , @xmath28 is a weighted count of degree @xmath29 branched covers of the riemann sphere @xmath30 by a genus @xmath31 compact , connected riemann surface which have ramification profile @xmath26 over @xmath32 , @xmath27 over @xmath33 , and the simplest non - trivial branching over @xmath34 additional specified points of @xmath30 , the number of which is determined by the riemann ",
    "hurwitz formula .",
    "it is convenient to introduce the notation    @xmath35    for this number .",
    "the double hurwitz numbers have been objects of intense study in both algebraic combinatorics and algebraic geometry , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein , and it is known that they exhibit a wide array of subtle structural properties . in @xcite , we introduced and studied the _ monotone double hurwitz numbers _",
    "@xmath36 , which count the same walks as the double hurwitz numbers @xmath24 , but with the monotonicity constraint imposed . in @xcite",
    ", we demonstrated that the monotone double hurwitz numbers enjoy a high degree of structural similarity with the classical double hurwitz numbers , and in @xcite we applied this structure to the asymptotic analysis of unitary matrix integrals via .",
    "while our analysis was purely combinatorial , geometric explanations of the concordance between monotone and classical hurwitz theory are gradually appearing , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "the present note is not about structural analogies between monotone and classical hurwitz numbers , but rather about an important quantitative difference between the two : growth rate .",
    "obviously , the monotone hurwitz number @xmath36 is smaller than its classical counterpart @xmath24  but how much smaller ?",
    "while explicit formulas for hurwitz numbers are few and far between ( see the introduction of @xcite for a summary of known formulas ) , the elementary genus zero formulas    @xmath37    already reveal a stark distinction : the classical hurwitz number grows superexponentially in the degree @xmath29 , whereas its monotone analogue exhibits only exponential growth .",
    "this sharp drop in growth rate plays an important role in analytic applications of monotone hurwitz theory @xcite , where one needs to know that , for any fixed @xmath23 , the generating function    @xmath38    enumerating all genus @xmath31 monotone transitive walks on @xmath0 is absolutely summable .",
    "in fact , one needs the stronger statement that the radius of convergence of @xmath39 is bounded below by a positive universal constant , so that one may consider @xmath40 as a family of holomorphic functions defined on a common complex domain .",
    "the goal of this note is to give a detailed proof of a precise form of this growth property .",
    "[ thm : main ] for any @xmath23 , the radius of convergence of the generating function @xmath39 is at least @xmath41 and at most @xmath42 .",
    "the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] consists of two components .",
    "the first component , which was established in @xcite using the results of @xcite , is concerns the generating function    @xmath43    for genus @xmath31 monotone",
    "_ simple _ hurwitz numbers @xmath44 , which count monotone transitive identity - based loops on the symmetric groups of length @xmath45 .",
    "more precisely , in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) , we proved that @xmath46 has radius of convergence @xmath42 by expressing it in terms of the gauss hypergeometric function",
    "@xmath47    this yields an upper bound of @xmath42 on the radius of convergence of @xmath39 .",
    "the second component of the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] , which we establish in proposition [ prop : inequalities ] of this paper , is the lower bound in theorem [ thm : main ] .",
    "this is obtained by showing that the terms of @xmath39 are larger than those of @xmath46 by at most an explicit exponential factor :    @xmath48    to prove the inequality , we make use of a _ sorting action _ of the symmetric group @xmath49 on @xmath15-step walks on @xmath0 which is in fact a close relative of hurwitz s classical braid group action on branched coverings ( see e.g.  @xcite for an informative discussion of braids and branched coverings ) .",
    "although the inequality is sufficient for our purposes , it may not be sharp .",
    "in fact , we conjecture that the radius of convergence of @xmath39 is exactly @xmath42 for all @xmath23 , so that , by pringsheim s theorem , these generating functions have a common dominant singularity at the critical point @xmath50",
    ". this would be consistent with various similarities between hurwitz numbers , maps on surfaces , and matrix models , where common singular behaviour of generating functions across all genera is an established phenomenon , see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .",
    "finally , we can not resist mentioning the striking fact , pointed out to us by p. di francesco , that the peculiar number @xmath42 also occurs in the enumeration of finite groups .",
    "namely , given a prime @xmath51 , let @xmath52 denote the number of isomorphism classes of groups of order @xmath53 ; it is known ( see @xcite and references therein ) that    @xmath54    any explanation of this coincidence would doubtless be very interesting .",
    "fix permutations @xmath9 and a positive integer @xmath15 , and consider the set @xmath55 of all ( not necessarily monotone or transitive ) @xmath15-step walks from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ( assume @xmath15 is large enough so that this set is non - empty ) .",
    "equivalently , @xmath55 is the set of @xmath15-tuples                                      if @xmath74 . in words ,",
    "the effect of @xmath66 is to swap the @xmath75 and @xmath76st steps of @xmath58 and then conjugate the step with the higher colour by the step with the lower colour ; if the two steps are the same colour , @xmath66 does nothing .",
    "since @xmath85 respects the action of @xmath49 , it sends each orbit of @xmath81 to an orbit of @xmath82 ; the question is whether the image orbit is smaller than the source orbit , and we can answer it by looking at stabilizers .",
    "consider the element of the image orbit which is sorted , that is , the spectrum @xmath86 such that @xmath87 .",
    "if the colour 2 appears @xmath88 times in the spectrum , the colour 3 appears @xmath89 times in the spectrum , and so on up to @xmath90 , then the stabilizer of the spectrum is the young subgroup            with spectrum @xmath86 . by definition , we have @xmath93 when @xmath94 , so the stabilizer of @xmath58 contains the young subgroup .",
    "since @xmath85 is well - defined , the stabilizer of @xmath58 can be no bigger , so in fact it is exactly this young subgroup . by the orbit - stabilizer theorem , the two orbits have the same size , so @xmath85 is a bijective correspondence between them , as needed .                  on @xmath0 which begin at a permutation @xmath16 of cycle type @xmath26 , end at a permutation @xmath17 of cycle type @xmath27 , and",
    "take a total of @xmath101 steps .",
    "given such a walk , there is a unique _ strictly _ monotone walk      from the identity permutation to @xmath16 , and this walk is of length @xmath103 .",
    "this fact , in different language , is due independently to jucys @xcite , and diaconis and greene @xcite ; see @xcite for a proof . similarly , there is a unique strictly monotone walk                      let @xmath110 be the set of colours which appear in the first part of the spectrum of the transitive genus @xmath31 loop , and similarly let @xmath111 be the set of colours which appear in the last part of the spectrum of this loop .",
    "let us use the sorting action of @xmath112 to rearrange the steps of in weakly increasing order :      so far , this procedure is reversible  given the sorted loop and the sets @xmath114 and @xmath115 , we can reconstruct the transitive loop , and hence the original walk .",
    "thus , to establish the stated inequalities , it suffices to show that , for every identity - based loop of length @xmath116 with @xmath97 colours in its spectrum , there are between @xmath117 and @xmath118 pairs of subsets @xmath119 for which the reverse construction succeeds .",
    "consider the possibilities for each of the @xmath97 colours in the spectrum :    1 .",
    "the colour appears in neither @xmath114 nor @xmath115 ; 2 .",
    "the colour appears in @xmath114 but not @xmath115 ; 3 .",
    "the colour does not appear in @xmath114 but appears in @xmath115 ; or 4 .",
    "the colour appears in both @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "possibilities ( 13 ) are always fine for the reverse construction , whereas option ( 4 ) only works when the colour appears at least twice in the spectrum .",
    "thus , there is an independent choice of at least 3 and at most 4 options for each of the @xmath97 colours , resulting in between @xmath117 and @xmath118 valid pairs @xmath119 ."
