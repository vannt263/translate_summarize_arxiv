    "the two - neutron halo structure observed in @xmath0he , @xmath4li , etc .",
    "is one of the most interesting topics in neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite .",
    "two - neutron halo nuclei are borromean systems , where the binary subsystems do not have bound states .",
    "they have been extensively studied theoretically and experimentally to understand their exotic binding mechanisms .",
    "theoretically , two - neutron halo nuclei have been investigated using the core  +  @xmath2  +  @xmath2 three - body models  @xcite , which indicate that the correlations between halo neutrons are important in the bindings  @xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that such a two - neutron correlation in the ground state is characterized as a spatially correlated neutron pair , the so - called dineutron  @xcite .",
    "coulomb breakup reactions have been employed to experimentally investigate the correlation between halo neutrons through the excitation mechanism of two - neutron halo nuclei  @xcite .",
    "the cross sections in the coulomb breakup reactions exhibit a low - lying peak just above the breakup thresholds .",
    "this peak should be responsible for the properties in weakly bound halo neutrons .",
    "the investigation of the ground - state structure of the dineutron based on a sum rule for the low - lying @xmath5 transition have led to a lot of arguments concerning the relation between the sum - rule value and the geometrical configuration of halo neutrons  @xcite . in most cases",
    ", it is assumed that the @xmath5 transition strength is directly deduced from the coulomb breakup cross section and a two - neutron halo nucleus is described as the core  +  @xmath2  +  @xmath2 three - body system where the core nucleus is taken to be inert . with the above assumption",
    ", the sum - rule value of the low - lying @xmath5 transition depends only on the geometrical configuration of the halo neutrons in the ground state  @xcite .",
    "this sum rule is referred to as the  cluster sum rule \" .",
    "the opening angle between two halo neutrons , which is a good measure of the spatial correlation of halo neutrons , has been obtained with the cluster sum rule : for the @xmath4li case , the opening angle between two halo neutrons was derived as @xmath6 degrees from the observed coulomb breakup cross section  @xcite .",
    "theoretically , on the other hand , it is shown that the coulomb breakup reactions have some problems when extracting information about the ground - state structure of two - neutron halo nuclei .",
    "firstly , the low - lying peaks in the cross sections are governed by strong final - state interactions ( fsis ) and the sequential decay via the core  +  @xmath2 resonance dominates the low - lying peak  @xcite .",
    "this fact shows that the geometrical configuration in the ground state can not be extracted from observables other than the cluster sum - rule value .",
    "secondly , the cluster sum rule itself would be invalid when the ground state of two - neutron halo nuclei contains a certain amount of the excited components of the core nucleus : in the cluster sum rule , the core nucleus is assumed to be inert . however , in the @xmath4li case , the sum rule value is reduced by about 15  % upon considering the @xmath7li core excitation  @xcite . to overcome the above problems and to discuss the dineutron more quantitatively ,",
    "other kinds of reactions are desired .",
    "the knockout reaction is another useful tool to investigate the ground - state structure of nuclei .",
    "in fact , for two - neutron halo nuclei , @xmath4li and @xmath8be , the one - neutron knockout reaction has been employed by bombarding them onto a @xmath7be target , and the contributions of the s- and p - states were discussed using the angular distributions of the emitted neutrons  @xcite . in the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , the relative contributions of different partial waves in @xmath4li were determined by considering the interference between different parity partial waves , which appears as asymmetry in the angular distribution .",
    "although the interference between different parity waves is critical for the dineutron correlation , the dineutron correlation is not discussed in ref .",
    "thus , it should be of interest to discuss the dineutron correlation from the asymmetry in the angular distribution of the knocked - out neutron from the two - neutron halo nuclei .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the possibility of extracting more quantitative and more reliable information about the dineutron correlation in borromean nuclei by means of the proton - induced neutron knockout reaction .",
    "although @xmath0he is used as an example , the method in this paper is applicable to any borromean nuclei . in one - neutron knockout reactions of two - neutron halo nuclei ,",
    "the other halo neutron is immediately emitted due to the borromean nature .",
    "we calculate the momentum distribution of the two emitted neutrons and discuss the spatial correlation between the neutrons . in particular , the distribution of the opening angle between the momentum vectors of the two emitted neutrons is determined .",
    "we hereafter refer this opening angle between the momentum vectors to as the `` correlation angle '' .",
    "to discuss the spatial correlations , we consider the quasi - free condition to minimize the fsis in the knockout reaction . in the quasi - free condition ,",
    "the knocked - out neutron with a high - momentum transfer is almost free from the fsis ; hence , it provides information about the ground - state structure .",
    "furthermore , it is essential to use a probe as it allows the inner part of the two - neutron wave function to provide a clear signature of the dineutron correlation from the knockout reaction . in this work ,",
    "we show that a proton target is a suitable probe . comparing the results of proton and @xmath9c targets",
    "shows that a proton target contrasts to heavy ions .",
    "it is also important to minimize the effect of the knockout process via the @xmath3he resonance to discuss the dineutron correlation in @xmath0he .",
    "if the knockout reaction is dominated due to the @xmath3he resonance , the correlation angle distribution is governed by the @xmath10 single - particle orbit corresponding to the @xmath3he resonance .",
    "such a dominance of the single spin - parity orbit suppresses the asymmetry in the distribution because the asymmetry originates from the interference between different parity single - particle orbits . in this work",
    ", we estimate the effect of the process via the @xmath3he resonance on the distribution and try to elucidate the kinematical condition that excludes the contribution from the knockout process via the @xmath3he resonance .    in the last part , a possible experimental setup that meets all the requirements of the theoretical arguments",
    "is considered .",
    "a high - momentum transfer , high statistics , and availability to pin down the state of the core are the keys .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : mod ] , we briefly explain the @xmath1  +  @xmath2  +  @xmath2 three - body model for @xmath0he and the calculation of the knockout reaction . in sec .  [",
    "sec : res ] , we calculate the momentum distribution and discuss the effect of the knockout process via the @xmath3he resonance and target dependence in the momentum distribution . from the calculated distribution ,",
    "we show the possibility of directly measuring the dineutron in @xmath0he .",
    "in addition to the theoretical arguments , a possible experimental setup to determine the dineutron correlation via the quasi - free knockout reaction is considered . all the results and discussions",
    "are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : sum ] .",
    "before discussing the knockout reaction , the @xmath1  +  @xmath2  +  @xmath2 three - body model for @xmath0he is briefly explained . to solve the relative motion of the @xmath1  +  @xmath2  +  @xmath2 system , we employed the orthogonality condition model ( ocm )  @xcite .    in the @xmath1  +  @xmath2  +  @xmath2 ocm , the wave function for @xmath0he is described as @xmath11 where the wave function of the @xmath1 core is expressed as @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath1 core is described by the harmonic oscillator wave function for the @xmath13 configuration . to reproduce the observed charge radius of @xmath14he ,",
    "the oscillator length @xmath15 is taken as 1.4 fm .",
    "the relative wave function of the @xmath1  +  @xmath2  +  @xmath2 system is obtained by solving the following schrdinger equation ; @xmath16 equation  ( [ eq : sch ] ) can be accurately solved with a few - body technique .",
    "here we employed the variational method called the hybrid-@xmath17 model whose detailed explanation is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian in eq .  ( [ eq : sch ] ) is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the kinetic operators for the @xmath21-th particle and the center - of - mass motion in the @xmath1  +  @xmath2  +  @xmath2 system , respectively .",
    "for two - body interactions of @xmath1-@xmath2 and @xmath2-@xmath2 , we used the effective interactions , which reproduce the scattering observables for each subsystem .",
    "we used the kknn potential  @xcite for @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the relative coordinates between the @xmath1 particle and the @xmath21-th neutron . for @xmath24",
    ", we used the minnesota force  @xcite with an exchange parameter of 0.95 .",
    "the pauli principle between the @xmath1 core and the neutrons is taken into account by the so - called pseudo potential @xmath25 .",
    "the pseudo potential is a projection operator to remove the pauli forbidden state @xmath26 from the relative motion between the @xmath1 core and the neutrons , and is given by @xmath27 the pauli forbidden state is defined as the @xmath28 orbits occupied by the @xmath1 core . in the present calculation ,",
    "the strength @xmath29 is taken as @xmath30 mev .",
    ".[tab : gsp ] ground - state properties of @xmath0he .",
    "two - neutron separation energy @xmath31 and matter and charge radii @xmath32 and @xmath33 are presented .",
    "probabilities of the partial wave components @xmath34 in the relative coordinate set shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : coord ] are also listed . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the experimental extraction of the signature of the two - neutron correlation discussed above demands ( i ) selection of the @xmath35 events with a sufficiently large momentum transfer , ( ii ) high statistics to divide the correlation angle distribution according to @xmath36 , and ( iii ) a kinematically complete measurement to tag contribution from the excited core states . in the following , an inverse kinematics experiment with a hydrogen target is considered .",
    "a recoil proton and a knocked - out neutron could be detected in dedicated detectors placed sideways .",
    "a decay neutron and a residual ion after the @xmath35 reaction could be analyzed with a large acceptance magnetic spectrometer ( e.g. , the samurai  @xcite at ribf and the aladin at gsi ) equipped with high - efficiency neutron detector arrays .    to suppress possible effects of three - body fsis , momenta of the recoil proton and",
    "the knocked - out neutron should be sufficiently larger than the nucleon fermi momentum in a nucleus , which is about 1.3  @xmath37 .",
    "this condition could be fulfilled using beams with incident energies higher than 200  mev / nucleon and restricting the recoil proton energy so that it exceeds 80  mev",
    ". radioactive nuclear beams at more than 200  mev / nucleon are presently available at the ri beam factory in japan and the gsi in germany and will be available at the frib in the usa in the near future .    selecting the high - momentum transfer condition",
    "is inevitably accompanied with a small cross section .",
    "the @xmath35 cross section is estimated to be on the order of 1 @xmath38b by the dwia calculation with a gate of 50 kev for @xmath36 . to obtain sufficient statistics for the momentum distribution at each @xmath36 for the small cross section , the experiment demands unprecedentedly high luminosity , typically of @xmath39  @xmath40sec@xmath41 .",
    "this could be realized with high - intensity radioactive nuclear beams at an intensity of @xmath42  sec@xmath41 and a thick liquid hydrogen target ( thickness of @xmath43  @xmath40 ) .",
    "an example of the latter is the minos@xcite , which is a device consisting of a very thick liquid hydrogen target and a time projection chamber surrounding the target .",
    "the target thickness is adjustable and can be as high as @xmath44  @xmath40 .",
    "determination of the vertex position with the time projection chamber allows the energy loss of the beam and the residual ions in the target to be corrected .",
    "consequently , high luminosity experiments could be realized without a significant loss in the experimental resolutions .",
    "a high luminosity enables tagging of the excited core contribution in borromean nuclei .",
    "the effects of the unbound core states , which are considered to be significant in @xmath4li , could be explored with invariant mass spectroscopy of the excited core states . on the other hand ,",
    "those of the bound excited core states , which is more important in heavier borromean nuclei , could be tagged through @xmath45-ray detection with a high - efficiency scintillator array .",
    "new data on the effects of excited cores should reveal unexplored aspects of borromean nuclei , resulting in a better understanding of the two - neutron correlation in the nuclei .",
    "we investigated the dineutron correlation in @xmath0he using the quasi - free neutron knockout reaction . in the present analysis , we calculated the momentum distribution of the two emitted neutrons , and compared them with that in the ground state to discuss the spatial correlation between halo neutrons .",
    "the pattern of the calculated momentum distribution differ from that in the ground state due to the knockout process via the @xmath3he(3/2@xmath46 ) resonance . to minimize the effect of the process via the @xmath3he resonance on the momentum distribution",
    ", we also demonstrated the momentum distribution by choosing the off - resonance region for the @xmath1-@xmath2 relative momentum . by selecting the @xmath1-@xmath2 relative momentum such that the process via the @xmath3he resonance is excluded",
    ", the distribution shows patterns similar to the ground state . for a lower @xmath1-@xmath2 relative momentum",
    ", the calculated distribution shows a clear enhancement at a larger correlation angle between the momenta of the two emitted neutrons .",
    "this result suggests that the spatially correlated neutron pair is in the surface region of the halo nucleus @xmath0he .",
    "in addition , we discussed the effect of the absorption by the target nucleus on the momentum distribution . the absorption by the target reduces not only the magnitude of the momentum distribution but also the asymmetry in the distribution .",
    "our results indicate that the use of the proton target , which is the most transparent probe sensitive to neutrons , is essential to investigate the spatial correlation of halo neutrons .",
    "furthermore , we also discussed a possible experimental setup to meet all the requirements according to the theoretical arguments .    in the present calculation , we use the simple reaction model , in which the zero - range @xmath47-@xmath2 interaction is adopted for the knockout part and only the absorption effect is taken into account in the distorting potentials . a more quantitative analysis based on the distorted - wave impulse approximation",
