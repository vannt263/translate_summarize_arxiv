    "research in dynamics and transport phenomena in turbulence have recently benefitted from experimental tracking of flow tracers , see for instance ( @xcite ) . ideally these tracers should have a size much smaller than the kolmogorov length @xmath5 where the velocity gradients are smooth and hence their motion follows fluid streamlines , but experimental constraints have often lead to the use of larger particles  with some bias as discusses _",

    "they have obtained several noteworthy results : ( i ) the variance of acceleration decreases as @xmath9 , after the manner with which pressure increments vary with size according to the kolmogorov scaling prediction .",
    "the influence of varying reynolds numbers ( @xmath8 $ ] ) has also been studied in @xcite showing that the variance of acceleration actually scales according to @xmath10 .",

    "@xcite note that pdfs for large particles sizes may be slightly below the fluid particle pdf however due to systematic uncertainties they can not draw any firm conclusion .",
    "our numerical study based on the faxn model ( @xcite ) suggests instead that the pdf shape should become narrower at increasing the particle size for @xmath13 .",

    "we find that : ( i ) there may be corrections to the @xmath3 scaling of acceleration variance which comes from intermittency .",
    "( ii ) the acceleration pdfs normalized by their variance are not independent of the particle size . by an indirect statistical analysis",

    "( iii ) the response time of the particle , as computed from the acceleration autocorrelation function , increases much strongly than previously reported in @xcite , and linearly with @xmath4 .",
    "( iv ) still there are now consolidate differences between results in von krmn ( vk ) and wind - tunnel ( wt ) turbulence , such as different functional forms for the acceleration pdfs , or the trend in the acceleration correlation time with particle size .",

    "the velocity is computed from the light scattering signal using the demodulation algorithm described in  @xcite , with a time resolution of about 30  @xmath28s .",
    "the acceleration is then computed by differentiation of the velocity output . because of measurement noise the signal has to be filtered using a gaussian smoothing kernel with window width @xmath29 as proposed in  @xcite .",
    "moments of the statistics of fluctuations of acceleration are computed for varying values of @xmath29 and interpolated to zero filter width .",
    "one expect that eulerian and lagrangian velocity statistics coincide under ergodicity approximation , so that the tracer particles velocities are expected to have gaussian statistics .",
    "our observation is that the velocity distribution is markedly sub - gaussian as seen in figure  [ fig1](a )  flatness values are ( @xmath30 ) for the 4 reynolds number values explored in this work .",
    "sub - gaussian statistics for the velocity have been observed in many experimental set - ups , however usually less pronounced than in our case .",

    "the von krmn flow has a large scale inhomogeneity and anistropy ( _ c.f . _",
    "@xcite ) which may enhance the sub - gaussianity . in such a confined geometry",
    "indeed , the vk flow is known to have several possible configurations of its large scale velocity profile ( @xcite ) ; each configuration may lead to gaussian velocity fluctuations about a locally different mean value with an overall effect leading to a sub - gaussian histogram .",
    "however , we have not observed any change in the velocity statistics when the reynolds number is increased or when the the size of the particle is changed by over an order of magnitude in @xmath4 . in fact , for this fully turbulent regime , the velocity variance is equal to 30% of the impeller tip speed  [ fig1](a ) .",

    "one expects that the second moment ( acceleration variance ) reduces with increasing particle size , because the pressure forces which mainly cause the motion are averaged over a growing area .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig2 ] , this is indeed observed .",
    "the evolution of the acceleration variance measured here is in agreement with previous studies by  @xcite : when normalized by the acceleration variance of the smallest particles ( fluid tracers , noted @xmath36 ) , the quantity @xmath37 exhibits a decrease consistent with the power law @xmath3 for all the reynolds numbers and inertial range particle sizes .",
    "let us recall that this power - law behavior is obtained when one assumes that the particle acceleration scales like pressure increments over a length equal to the particle s diameter . in the inertial range of scales ,",
    "this argument yields the scaling @xmath38  where @xmath39 is the pressure @xmath40-order structure function .",

    ", title=\"fig:\",width=264 ]    the observed behavior is quite different from the prediction of point - particle ( pp ) models , for which the stokes drag term becomes rapidly negligible when the particle size increases , so that the response time remains that of fluid tracers @xcite .",
    "a first refinement of the pp - model is to account for size effects by averaging the flow fields over the area of the particle ( for the estimation of drag ) and over its volume ( for added mass effects ) ; this is the essence of the faxn - corrected model ( fc ) introduced by  @xcite . using it ,",
    "the authors have observed a variation of the particle response time with size : it increases by almost a factor of 2 when the size of the particle increases from @xmath53 to up to @xmath54 .",
    "this finding was in general agreement with experimental measurement in a wind tunnel by  @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  3(a ) , our observations in a von krmn flow show a much steeper increase : the response time of the particles is about four times that of the tracers when the diameter has grown to @xmath55 , and the variation is roughly linear .",
    "however , our data are not sufficiently extended to exclude the scaling @xmath56 , which comes from assuming that the response time varies as the eddy turnover time at the scale of the particle .",
    "the estimation of higher even moments of particle accelerations requires specific data processing , as we show in the following .",
    "we first discuss the raw distributions of the acceleration . in figure",

    "the wind tunnel data by  @xcite is at @xmath57.,width=302 ]    to leading order , the distribution functions are very similar , as observed in the wind tunnel measurements by  @xcite .",
    "there is no reduction to gaussian statistics as the particle size grows well into the inertial range ( see also  @xcite with particles on integral size ) .",
    "however , as can be observed in the figure , there is a significant influence of the flow generation process on the form of the probability distribution . in figure",
    "[ fig3 ] , the pdf for the smallest particles is identical to that observed for tracers in the vk flow operated by bodenschatz s group , _ c.f .",

    "it is different from the pdfs reported by  @xcite and by  @xcite from wind - tunnel measurements .",
    "these observed variation are more pronounced than what could be expected from reynolds number variations alone between the experiments , and we thus propose that the pdfs of accelerations are not universal , but flow - dependent . this conclusion is linked to the observation ( reported in  @xcite ) that the lagrangian small scale dynamics still reflects the anisotropy of the larges scales .     and its moments @xmath58 and @xmath59 , for data at @xmath41 processed using a gaussian smoothing with width @xmath60 .",

    "( right , bottom ) : relative evolution of the two estimators .",
    ", width=453 ]    investigating the possibility of sub - leading changes in the statistics of acceleration with size or reynolds number can be done by studying higher order moments , starting with the distribution flatness .",
    "it requires a converged measurement of the pdfs and , as shown for tracer particles by  @xcite , this implies extremely large data sets . as a first attempt",
    ", we fit the acceleration pdf with a model functional form which we then use to _ estimate _ the flatness of the distribution .",
    "the procedure is as follows : we assume that the statistics is described by a functional form @xmath67 ; @xmath68 is a set of adjustable parameters which are determined by minimizing the distance @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the measured distribution .",
    "two trial distributions have been tested :    @xmath71    which stems from the assumption that the acceleration amplitude has a lognormal distribution , and the stretched exponential functional form    @xmath72    ( @xmath73 being a normalization constant ) which has three adjustable parameters @xmath74 , and allows for a finer adjustment of the distribution in the tails .",
    "note that with distributions having such extended wings , a ` brute force ' measurement of the flatness factor within a 5% accuracy would mean a resolution of the distribution up to about 100 standard deviations , and events with probability below @xmath75  clearly outside of direct experimental reach !    figure [ fig4 ] shows a comparison of the acceleration pdf for the smallest particles at @xmath76 and the corresponding fits that minimize the distance to the quantity @xmath77 .",
    "as one can see , both functional form fit correctly the experimental data up to @xmath78 , the stretch exponential form showing a better agreement with the second order moment .",
    "as reported in previous studies , the moments of the acceleration pdfs strongly depend on the width @xmath29 of the smoothing kernel used to extract the velocity data from the modulated optical signal ( cf .",
    "section  2 ) .",
    "we thus estimate the flatness by fitting the different pdfs for decreasing @xmath29 and then interpolate to zero width .",
    "the result of this procedure is shown in figure  [ fig4](d ) for the two trial functional forms . as can be seen",
    "the flatness derived from the lognormal estimator is roughly @xmath79 higher than the one computed from the stretch exponential estimator .",
    "indeed , we find that the flatness computed from each function follow an identical behavior : when plotting , as in figure  [ fig4](e ) , the values estimated from the lognormal fit versus the ones computed from the stretch exponential estimator , one observe a linear dependance .",
    "the values of the flatness reported are understood as estimates , the true values strongly depending on the real shape of the acceleration pdf in the far tails .",
    "we propose however that the _ variations _ detected here yield a first order approximation of the evolution of acceleration statistics with particle size .",
    "for different sizes and different reynolds numbers .",
    "( a ) stretch exponential estimator ; ( b ) lognormal estimator.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]   for different sizes and different reynolds numbers . ( a ) stretch exponential estimator ; ( b ) lognormal estimator.,title=\"fig:\",width=226 ]",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig6](a , b ) . for both estimators",
    ", one observes a reduction of the flatness with increasing particle size .",
    "the observed decrease can be understood if one takes into account the intermittency of the pressure increments for inertial range separations . indeed , following the approach developed by  @xcite , one estimates the acceleration flatness @xmath80 by assuming that the force acting on the particles is dominated by the pressure gradient at size @xmath45 .",
    "all moments of the acceleration ( @xmath81 ) should then scale as @xmath82 , its behavior being dictated by the pressure structure functions .",
    "now , in order to estimate the pressure structure functions , one can either use the ansatz that pressure increments scale as the square of velocity increments , @xmath83 or one can measure directly the scaling of pressure in the experiment .",
    "in the first case , one obtains @xmath84 , @xmath85 being the structure function exponents of the velocity increments .",
    "one then has @xmath86 , if one assumes a lognormal scaling for the eulerian velocity structure functions as in  @xcite , independent of the reynolds number . the direct experimental measurement of pressure ( using piezoelectric sensor mounted flush with the lateral wall , in the mid - plane of the flow ) yields @xmath87 and @xmath88 , values which are in agreement with eulerian dns data at @xmath89 ( from the dns by  @xcite ) . in the case of the stretch exponential estimator ,",
    "these predictions for the scaling exponent are consistent with the the value @xmath90 obtained by fitting the data with a power law @xmath91 with @xmath4 in the range @xmath92 $ ] . in the case of the lognormal estimator",
    "one finds a scaling law @xmath93 .",
    "here we stress that @xmath94 and @xmath95 are intrinsically different distributions , therefore it is in principle impossible to fit both curves with the same scaling exponent .",
    "the true value of the exponent ( if it exists ) should depend on the real shape of the pdfs .",
    "however , the consistency between the estimation using the stretch exponential estimator and the eulerian measurements of pressure suggests that this estimator is a good fit of the acceleration pdfs in the case of large acceleration flatness ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "this was confirmed by comparing the quality of the two different estimators with data obtained at @xmath89 ( @xmath97 , @xcite ) . using a troncated dataset as a test",
    ", the stretch exponential estimator showed to be a better fit than the lognormal estimator , and was able to give an estimate of the flatness @xmath98 lower than the converged value computed with the all dataset .",
    "finally , we note that following the same approach , one can use the second order pressure structure function to get a new estimate of the decrease of the acceleration variance @xmath99 . assuming a lognormal scaling for the velocity increments ,",
    "one then finds @xmath100 very close to the experimental measurements which yields @xmath101 .",
    "these two values are in a very good agreement with the best fit shown as a dashed line in figure  2 which yields @xmath102 . in our opinion",
    "this is an indirect proof that intermittency should play a role , and that our results concerning the acceleration flatness , if preliminary , are consistent .",
    "scaling properties of the acceleration of ( neutrally buoyant ) inertial particles , _",
    "i.e. _ concerning finite size effects for the motion of advected particles , have been investigated in detail .",
    "one finding is statistics is well accounted for by the behavior of pressure increments , which in turn are connected to the eulerian properties of velocity increments .",
    "a first estimation concerning the evolution of the particle acceleration pdf with size suggests a reduction of the flatness with a @xmath103 scaling behavior .",
    "however , since the precise functional form actually depends on the large scale flow properties , this results need to be confronted to measurements in other flows , such as grid or jet turbulence .",
    "another observation is that the evolution of the acceleration auto - correlation functions allow for the estimation of a particle response time .",
    "our finding is that it increases linearly with the particle size in the range of sizes explored .",
    "one point that will deserve further studies is the dependence on reynolds number .",
    "here we have achieved a satisfactory collapse of measured quantities when the particle size is made non - dimensional using the kolmogorov length @xmath1 .",
    "this may be justified for the @xmath104 values and particle sizes investigates here ; for larger particles or lower reynolds numbers one may also want to probe scaling properties as a function of @xmath105 , with @xmath106 the flow integral scale . here",
