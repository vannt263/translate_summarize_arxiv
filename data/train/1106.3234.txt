    "to demonstrate our method of selecting autonomous nodes we consider two er graphs with average degree @xmath11 and @xmath7 of autonomous nodes ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "first we consider a method based on the degree of the node and later we compare with the method based on the betweenness . under a sequence of random failures ,",
    "the networks are catastrophically fragmented when close to @xmath34 of the nodes fail , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig::orderparam ] . for a single er , with the same average degree",
    ", the global connectivity is only lost after the failure of @xmath35 of the nodes .",
    "figure  [ fig::orderparam ] also shows ( line ) the results for choosing as autonomous nodes in both networks the fraction @xmath36 of the nodes with the highest degree and coupling the remaining ones at random . with this strategy ,",
    "the robustness @xmath10 can be improved and the corresponding increase of @xmath37 is about @xmath38 , from close to @xmath39 to close to @xmath40 .",
    "also the order of the transition changes from first to second order .",
    "further improvement can be achieved if additionally the coupled nodes are paired according to their position in the ranking of degree , since interconnecting similar nodes increases the global robustness @xcite . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig::orderparam ] we see the dependence on @xmath9 of the relative robustness for the degree strategy compared to the random case @xmath41 . for the entire range of @xmath9 the proposed strategy is more efficient and a relative improvement of more than @xmath42 is observed when still @xmath43 of the nodes are coupled .",
    "two types of technological challenges are at hand : either a system has to be designed robust from scratch or it already exists , constrained to a certain topology , but requires improved robustness . in the former case , the best procedure is to choose as autonomous the nodes with highest degree in each network and couple the others based on their rank of degree . for the latter , rewiring is usually a time - consuming and expensive process , and the creation of new autonomous nodes may be economically more feasible .",
    "the simplest procedure consists in choosing as autonomous both nodes connected by the same inter - network link .",
    "however , in general , the degree of a pair of coupled nodes is not , necessarily , correlated . in fig .",
    "[ fig::orderparam ] we compare between choosing the autonomous pairs based on the degree of the node in network @xmath1 or in network @xmath8 . when pairs of nodes are picked based on their rank in the network under the initial failure ( network @xmath1 ) , the robustness almost does not improve compared to choosing randomly . if , on the other hand , network @xmath8 is considered , the robustness is significantly improved , revealing that this scheme is more efficient .",
    "this asymmetry between @xmath1 and @xmath8 network is due to the fact that we attack only nodes in network @xmath1 , triggering the cascade , that initially shuts down the corresponding @xmath8-node .",
    "the degree of this @xmath8-node is related to the number of nodes which become disconnected from the main cluster and consequently affect back the network @xmath1 . therefore , the control of the degree of vulnerable @xmath8-nodes is a key mechanism to downsize the cascade . on the other hand , when a hub is protected in network @xmath1 it can still be attacked since the initial attack does not distinguish between autonomous and non - autonomous nodes .    in fig .",
    "[ fig::robustness](a ) we compare four different criteria to select the autonomous nodes : betweenness , degree , k - shell , and random choice , for two coupled er networks . in the betweenness strategy , the selected autonomous are the ones with highest betweenness .",
    "the betweenness is defined as the number of shortest paths between all pairs of nodes passing through the node @xcite . in the k - shell strategy , the autonomous are the ones with highest k - shell in the k - shell decomposition @xcite . the remaining nodes , for all cases , have been randomly inter - linked . since er",
    "networks are characterized by a small number of k - shells , this strategy is even less efficient than the random strategy for some values of @xmath9 , while the improved robustness for degree and betweenness strategies is evident compared with the random selection . while in the random case , for @xmath44 , a significant decrease of the robustness with @xmath9 is observed , in the degree and betweenness cases , the change is smoother and only significantly drops for higher values of @xmath9 .",
    "a maximum in the ratio @xmath41 occurs for @xmath45 , where the relative improvement is above @xmath46 . since in random networks ,",
    "the degree of a node is strongly correlated with its betweenness @xcite , their results are similar .",
    "many real - world systems are characterized by a degree distribution which is scale free with a degree exponent @xmath47 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig::robustness](b ) we plot @xmath10 as a function of @xmath9 for two coupled scale - free networks ( sf ) with @xmath14 nodes each and @xmath12 . similar to the two coupled er , this system is also significantly more resilient when the autonomous nodes are selected according to the highest degree or betweenness . for values of @xmath48 the robustness is similar to that of a single network ( @xmath49 ) since the most relevant nodes are decoupled .",
    "a peak in the relative robustness , @xmath41 ( see inset of fig .  [ fig::robustness]b ) , occurs for @xmath50 where the improvement , compared to the random case , is almost @xmath51 .",
    "betweenness , degree , and @xmath52-shell , have similar impact on the robustness since these three properties are strongly correlated for sf . from fig .",
    "[ fig::robustness ] , we see that , for both sf and er , the robustness is significantly improved by decoupling , based on the betweenness , less than @xmath42 of the nodes . studying the dependence of the robustness on the average degree of the nodes we conclude that for average degree larger than five , even @xmath53 autonomous nodes are enough to achieve more than @xmath54 of the maximum possible improvement .    for the cases discussed in fig .",
    "[ fig::robustness ] , results obtained by selecting autonomous nodes based on the highest degree do not significantly differ from the ones based on the highest betweenness .",
    "this is due to the well known finding that for erds - rnyi and scale - free networks , the degree of a node is strongly correlated with its betweenness @xcite . however ,",
    "many real networks are modular , i.e. , composed of several different modules interconnected by less links , and then nodes with higher betweenness are not , necessarily , the ones with the largest degree @xcite .",
    "modularity can be found , for example , in metabolic systems , neural networks , social networks , or infrastructures @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig::fourer ] we plot the robustness for two coupled modular networks .",
    "each modular network was generated from a set of four erds - rnyi networks , of @xmath16 nodes each and average degree five , where an additional link was randomly included between each pair of modules . for a modular network , the nodes with higher betweenness are not necessarily the high - degree nodes but the ones bridging the different modules .",
    "figure  [ fig::fourer ] shows that the strategy based on the betweenness emerges as better compared to the high degree method .",
    "another example that shows that betweenness is superior to degree is when we study coupled random regular graphs . in random regular graphs all nodes have the same degree and are connected randomly .",
    "figure  [ fig::rr ] shows the dependence of the robustness on the degree of coupling , for two interconnected random regular graphs with degree @xmath55 .",
    "the autonomous nodes are selected randomly ( since all degrees are the same ) or following the betweenness strategy . though all nodes have the same degree and the betweenness distribution is narrow ,",
    "selecting autonomous nodes based on the betweenness is always more efficient than the random selection .",
    "thus , the above two examples suggest that betweenness is a superior method to chose the autonomous nodes compared to degree .",
    "the vulnerability is strongly related to the degree of coupling @xmath9 .",
    "_ @xcite have analytically and numerically shown that , for random coupling , at a critical coupling @xmath56 , the transition changes from continuous ( for @xmath57 ) to discontinuous ( for @xmath58 ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig::diagram ] we see the two - parameter diagram ( @xmath37 vs @xmath9 ) with the tricritical point and the transition lines ( continuous and discontinuous ) for the random ( inset ) and the degree ( main ) strategies . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig::diagram ] , when autonomous nodes are randomly selected , about @xmath38 autonomous nodes are required to soften the transition and avoid catastrophic cascades , while following the strategy proposed here only a relatively small amount ( @xmath59 ) of autonomous nodes are needed to avoid a discontinuous collapse . above the tricritical point , the jump increases with the degree of coupling , lending arguments to the paramount necessity of an efficient strategy for autonomous selection , given that the fraction of nodes which can be decoupled is typically limited .",
    "the dependence of @xmath60 on the average degree @xmath19 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::qtk ] .",
    "the ratio between the tricritical coupling for degree and random strategies increases with decreasing @xmath19 .",
    "for example , for the fraction of autonomous nodes needed to soften the transition with the random selection is six times the one for the degree strategy .    as in ref .",
    "@xcite , following the theory of riedel and wegner @xcite , we can characterize the tricritical point .",
    "two relevant scaling fields are defined : one tangent ( @xmath20 ) and the other perpendicular ( @xmath61 ) to the critical curve at the tricritical point . in these",
    "coordinate axes the continuous line is described by @xmath62 , where the tricritical crossover exponent @xmath63 for degree and random strategies .",
    "the tricritical order parameter exponent , @xmath21 , can be evaluated from , @xmath64 giving @xmath65 for both strategies . since these two exponents are strategy independent ( see fig .",
    "[ fig::crossover ] ) , we conjecture that the tricritical point for degree and random selection are in the same universality class .",
    "here , we propose a method to chose the autonomous nodes in order to optimize the robustness of coupled networks to failures .",
    "we find the betweenness and the degree to be the key parameters for the selection of such nodes and we disclose the former as the most effective for modular networks .",
    "considering the real case of the italian communication network coupled with the power grid , we show in fig .",
    "[ fig::italy ] that protecting only the four communication servers with highest betweenness reduces the chances of catastrophic failures like that witnessed during the blackout in 2003 . when this strategy is implemented the resilience to random failures or attacks",
    "is significantly improved and the fraction of autonomous nodes necessary to change the nature of the percolation transition , from discontinuous to continuous , is significantly reduced .",
    "we also show that , even for networks with a narrow diversity of nodes like erds - rnyi graphs , the robustness can be significantly improved by properly choosing a small fraction of nodes to be autonomous . as a follow - up",
    "it would be interesting to understand how correlation between nodes , as well as dynamic processes on the network , can influence the selection of autonomous nodes . besides , the cascade phenomena and the mitigation of vulnerabilities on regular lattices and geographically embedded networks are still open questions .",
    "we consider two coupled networks , @xmath1 and @xmath8 , where a fraction of @xmath3 @xmath1-nodes fails . the cascade of failures can be described by the iterative equations @xcite @xmath66 , \\\\",
    "\\alpha_n & = & p \\left ( 1 - q_{\\beta , n } \\left [ 1 - s_{\\beta_{n-1}b}(\\beta_{n-1 } ) \\right ] \\right ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the fraction of @xmath1 and @xmath8 surviving nodes at iteration step @xmath29 ( not necessarily in the largest component ) , and @xmath67 ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) is the fraction of nodes in the largest component in network @xmath70 given that @xmath71 nodes have failed .",
    "this can be calculated using generating functions . @xmath72",
    "( @xmath73 ) is the fraction of nodes in network @xmath1 ( @xmath8 ) which have fragmented from the giant cluster ; and changes as the iterative procedure advances .      as proposed by parshani _",
    "@xcite , when autonomous nodes are randomly selected and the degree of coupling is the same in @xmath1 and @xmath8 , the set of eqs .",
    "[ iteration ] simplifies to @xmath74 , \\\\",
    "\\alpha_n & = & p \\left ( 1 - q \\left [ 1 - s_b(\\beta_{n-1 } ) \\right ] \\right ) , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the degree of coupling .",
    "the degree distribution of the networks does not change in the case of random failures and , therefore , @xmath67 is simplified to @xmath75 , which can be calculated as @xcite @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the generating function of the degree distribution of network @xmath70 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 satisfies the transcendental equation @xmath80                when autonomous nodes are selected following the degree strategy , the fraction of dependent nodes @xmath85 changes with the iteration step @xmath29 and the set of eqs .  [ iteration ] no longer simplifies .",
    "we divide the discussion below into three different parts : the degree distribution , the largest component , and the coupling ( fraction of dependent nodes ) .",
    "the networks a and b are characterized by their degree distributions , @xmath86 and @xmath87 , which are not necessarily the same .",
    "the developed formalism applies to any arbitrary degree distribution .",
    "we start by first splitting the degree distribution into two parts , the component corresponding to the low - degree dependent nodes , @xmath88 , and the component corresponding to the high - degree autonomous ones , @xmath89 . to accomplish this ,",
    "one must determine two parameters , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , from the relations @xmath92 and @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the initial degree of coupling and @xmath91 is the fraction of nodes with degree @xmath90 that are dependent , i.e. , coupled with nodes in the other network .",
    "one can then write @xmath95 and @xmath96    in the model , a fraction of @xmath3 @xmath1-nodes are randomly removed . if , at iteration step @xmath29 , @xmath27 nodes survive , @xmath97 nodes are necessarily autonomous and the remaining ones , @xmath98 , are dependent nodes .",
    "one can then show that the degree distribution of network @xmath1 , under the failure of @xmath99 nodes , @xmath100 , is given by @xmath101 while the fraction of surviving links is @xmath102        with the degree distribution @xmath106 and the fraction of surviving links @xmath107 one can calculate the size of the largest component as @xmath108 where @xmath109 satisfies the self consistent equation @xmath110      to calculate the fraction @xmath72 ( and @xmath73 ) one must first calculate the degree distribution of the nodes in the largest component .",
    "this is given by @xmath111 the fraction of nodes in the largest component that are autonomous is then given by @xmath112 so that the fraction of autonomous nodes from the original network remaining in the largest component is @xmath113 while the total fraction of autonomous nodes is given by @xmath114 the fraction of nodes disconnected from the largest component that are autonomous is then given by @xmath115 so that the fraction of dependent nodes which have fragmented from the largest component is @xmath116    for simplicity , here we consider that @xmath117 and @xmath91 are constant and do not change during the iterative process .",
    "in fact , this is an approximation as the degrees of the autonomous nodes are expected to change when their neighbors fail .",
    "however , in spite of shifting the transition point , this consideration does not change the global picture described here .          where @xmath119 is the number of node failures , @xmath120 the size of the largest connected cluster in a network after @xmath119 failures , and @xmath121 is the total number of nodes in the network @xcite .",
    "this definition corresponds to the area under the curve of the fraction of nodes , in the largest connected cluster , as a function of the fraction of failed nodes ( shown in fig .",
    "we extend this definition to coupled systems by performing the same measurement , given by eq .",
