    "we first show that the symmetrized @xmath16-point loop vanishes , if one of the external momenta vanishes .",
    "the symmetrized @xmath16-point loop is given by a sum over all permutations of external momenta .",
    "for a vanishing external momentum two fermion lines in the loop carry the same internal momentum . by permutations",
    "the vertex with the vanishing momentum is cycled around the loop , yielding the sum @xmath164 since the denominator of @xmath165 is linear in @xmath166 , the integrand can be written as a @xmath166-derivative , @xmath167 . performing",
    "the @xmath166-integration one thus finds that the symmetrized @xmath16-point loop vanishes if one leg has a vanishing momentum . by dimensional analysis ,",
    "the uv scaling of the symmetrized loop with one fixed external momentum is thus reduced by a factor @xmath168 .",

    "hence , the uv scaling of symmetrized loops for @xmath171 large momenta and two fixed external momenta @xmath104 and @xmath172 is reduced by a factor @xmath173 .",
    "we now use the above results on the asymptotic behavior of fermion loops to obtain improved power - counting estimates for the ultraviolet behavior of several classes of feynman diagrams .",
    "we consider contributions to the boson and fermion self - energies , the fermion - boson vertex , and the three - boson vertex .",

    "such a divergence is not renormalizable .",
    "the implications of that singularity are not clear at the moment .",
    "it is remarkable that the one - loop result receives qualitative corrections only at four - loop order , while the dynamical exponent @xmath9 remains unchanged at two- and three loop order .",
    "such a situation is peculiar but not unprecedented in quantum field theory . for example , in non - linear @xmath185-models describing the critical behavior of the anderson localization transition , only the four - loop contributions lift a degeneracy between distinct symmetry groups and correct the one - loop result for critical localization length and conductivity exponents  @xcite .",
    "perturbative contributions to the fermion self - energy @xmath186 with @xmath175 loops contain @xmath175 boson propagators and @xmath187 fermion propagators .",
    "hence , @xmath175 loop contributions to the fermion self - energy diverge as @xmath188 in the ultraviolet limit for any @xmath175 and @xmath15 .",
    "this divergent contribution is however momentum and frequency independent and can be absorbed by a shift of the fermi surface .",
    "physically more interesting is the momentum and frequency dependence of the self - energy . in particular , the derivative @xmath189 with @xmath190 determines the anomalous dimension of the fermion fields  @xcite . since @xmath166 and @xmath191 scale as @xmath188 , that derivative scales as @xmath192 according to the above power - counting .",
    "hence , logarithmic uv divergences are expected , and indeed occur already at three - loop order ( see fig .  5 ) , as discovered for @xmath9 by metlitski and sachdev  @xcite .",
    "the three - point fermion loop in these three - loop contributions is not reduced by any of the cancellations we discussed above , since all three boson momenta can be large .",
    "we now discuss the fermion - boson vertex @xmath193 with one boson and two fermion legs .",
    "perturbative @xmath175-loop vertex corrections contain @xmath175 boson propagators and @xmath177 fermion propagators .",
    "hence , @xmath193 scales as @xmath192 in the uv limit , that is , logarithmic divergences are expected .",
    "the vertex corrections can be grouped in two classes . in the first case , the external boson leg couples to an open fermion line , and in the second to a fermion loop . in fig .",
    "6 we provide a three - loop example for each case .        in the first case we do not expect any cancellations , but in the second we have a fermion loop with a fixed boson momentum @xmath104 .",
    "hence , summing all diagrams corresponding to the symmetrized fermion loop , the uv contributions are suppressed by a factor @xmath182 so that the sum is guaranteed to be finite .",
    "the fermion - boson vertex is related to the fermion self - energy by the usual ward - identity following from charge conservation  @xcite .",
    "since the fermion self - energy exhibits a logarithmic divergence already at three - loop order , the fermion - boson vertex has to diverge , too .",
    "the above argument shows that the divergent contributions to the vertex come exclusively from those diagrams where the boson leg couples to an open fermion line .      as a final example",
    ", we consider the three - boson vertex .",
    "its lowest order ( one loop ) contribution is simply the symmetrized three - point fermion loop @xmath194 , which does not exhibit any uv divergence . @xmath175-loop",
    "corrections to the three - boson vertex contain @xmath176 boson propagators and @xmath195 fermion propagators .",
    "naive power - counting thus yields a uv scaling of the form @xmath183 . for @xmath9",
    "this is marginal .",
    "however , each of the external boson legs is linked directly to a fermion loop ( see , for example , fig .  7 ) . upon loop symmetrization",
    "possible uv divergences are thus suppressed . without investigating the exact degree of suppression we can say that in the most interesting physical case @xmath9 all corrections",
    "will be uv finite .",
    "the uv convergence of @xmath16-loop vertices with @xmath196 is also improved by cancellations in the symmetrized fermion loops , but they are already uv convergent even within naive power - counting for @xmath197 .",
    "we have analyzed general properties of the perturbative loop expansion for two - dimensional quantum critical metals with singular forward scattering .",
    "important cases falling in this class of systems are metals at an ising nematic qcp and metals coupled to a @xmath0 gauge field .",
    "our analysis is based on the effective field theory for such systems  @xcite , extended to arbitrary dynamical exponents @xmath42 as proposed earlier by nayak and wilczek  @xcite .",
    "we have derived asymptotic properties of fermion loops appearing as subdiagrams of feynman diagrams contributing to the perturbation series .",
    "substantial cancellations occur when summing over contributions corresponding to permutations of vertices at fermion loops with a small external momentum @xmath104 or two small momenta @xmath104 and @xmath172 ( while all the other momenta become large ) .",
    "furthermore , fermion loops are suppressed below the naive power - counting estimate when they are traversed by only one large bosonic momentum .    using these properties we have shown in a number of specific examples how one can perform a _",
    "sharp _ ultraviolet power - counting that takes all possible cancellations into account .",
    "most importantly , for the boson self - energy there is always a gain of order @xmath188 . as a consequence , perturbative contributions to that quantity are uv convergent for @xmath1 .",
    "hence , perturbative self - energy corrections to the boson propagator are finite at all loop orders for @xmath1 . in the static limit @xmath108 , the boson self - energy",
    "is then fixed by dimensional analysis to be proportional to @xmath39 with a finite prefactor .",
    "a bare @xmath1 is thus not renormalized by fluctuations . on the other hand ,",
    "logarithmic divergences are possible in the important physical case with a dynamical exponent @xmath9 , and indeed do occur at four - loop order  @xcite . for @xmath198",
    "there are uv divergences proportional to @xmath183 .    obviously , @xmath9 is a critical value at the boundary between the qualitatively different cases @xmath1 and @xmath198 .",
    "interestingly , the same critical value @xmath9 separates two qualitatively different behaviors of the _ compressibility _ , if the chemical potential @xmath199 couples to the bosonic mass appearing away from the qcp . for @xmath200",
    "the compressibility is finite , while for @xmath2 it diverges upon approaching the qcp  @xcite .",
    "our result that a bare @xmath200 is not renormalized by fluctuations at any loop order thus implies that the compressibility remains finite in that case .",
    "there are no systematic cancellations reducing the uv divergences of the fermion self - energy .",
    "hence , the fermionic field renormalization obtained from a first momentum derivative of the self - energy diverges logarithmically for any @xmath15 .",
    "in contrast to the behavior of the boson self - energy , the degree of divergence of the fermion self - energy is independent of @xmath15 .",
    "logarithmic divergences obtained in perturbation theory can be summed up to yield anomalous power - law scaling , as demonstrated in the three - loop calculation for @xmath9 by metlitski and sachdev  @xcite .    at this point",
    ", the perturbative singularity structure of the above class of critical metals seems to be clarified for @xmath1 .",
    "the one - loop fixed point is only modified by an anomalous scaling of the fermion fields .",
    "however , the final fate of the theory in the special but physically relevant case @xmath9 remains open .",
    "organizing the loop expansion in terms of symmetrized fermion loops and exploiting the cancellations described above should be useful for any future work on fluctuation corrections .",
    "in particular , a numerical computation of fluctuation corrections is greatly facilitated by incorporating the cancellations directly via symmetrized loops .",
