    "intermetallic compounds @xmath4fe@xmath2 with high concentration of iron ( @xmath5 is a rare - earth ion ) are of interest for both experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "@xcite these compounds are distinct for a relatively large magnetic moment  mainly caused by the magnetic moments at the fe ions  and comparatively low curie temperature @xmath3 .",
    "the compounds are crystallized in two related crystal structures ",
    "rhombohedral @xmath6-type and hexagonal @xmath7-type . in each of these structures ,",
    "the fe ions can be located in four inequivalent crystallographic positions , and for this reason various experiments reveal four values of the local magnetic moments at different positions of the fe ions . also , most of the intermetallic compounds @xmath4fe@xmath2 have collinear magnetic structure except for ce@xmath1fe@xmath2 , tm@xmath1fe@xmath2 , and lu@xmath1fe@xmath2 ,  @xcite where the magnetic moments of the fe ions in all crystallographic positions are collinear to each other , but frequently antiparallel to the magnetic moments of the rare - earth ions @xmath5 .    initially , the moderate curie temperatures @xmath3 in the compounds @xmath4fe@xmath2 was explained on the base of assumption@xcite of a critical distance @xmath8  @xmath9between two ions in a fe - fe pair , so that for the distances @xmath10 the exchange interaction is antiferromagnetic , whereas for @xmath11  ferromagnetic . from this assumption",
    "it followed that a low value of @xmath3 is caused by a competition of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between neighboring pairs of the fe ions in various crystallographic positions .",
    "it also meant that an expansion of the lattice should result in an increased number of ferromagnetic interactions and corresponding growth of @xmath3 .",
    "such an expansion of the lattice can be reached either inserting nonmagnetic interstitial atoms ,  @xcite or substituting the fe ions by nonmagnetic atoms with the larger ionic radii .",
    "@xcite    however , in a number of experiments , for example , for substitutional solid solutions @xmath4fe@xmath12si@xmath13 , it was found that the crystal lattice contracts , and @xmath3 grows .",
    "@xcite these results question the adequacy of the simple model of exchange interactions of neighboring exchange - bounded ions that change the sign at the critical distance @xmath14 between the ions .    to determine a relation between @xmath3 and exchange interactions in the @xmath4fe@xmath2 series , the compound gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 is of especial interest .",
    "first , among the series gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 has the highest curie temperature @xmath3 .",
    "secondly , gd itself is located at the middle of the rare - earth series , and gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 separates the compounds with light rare - earth elements crystallizing in the rhombohedral @xmath15-type structure , from the compounds with heavy rare - earth elements crystallizing in the hexagonal @xmath16-type structure .",
    "thus gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 is an intriguing example among the @xmath4fe@xmath2 series which can be found in both crystal structures .",
    "apparently , in most experiments samples are mixture of two structures . at the same time , there are experimental works for either pure rhombohedral structure ,  @xcite or pure hexagonal structure@xcite of gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 . for gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 in the rhombohedral structure , the values of critical temperature and saturation magnetization were found to be @xmath17=475  k ,  @xcite @xmath18=21.5  @xmath19/f.u .",
    ",  @xcite respectively . for the hexagonal structure ,",
    "these values are @xmath20=466  k and @xmath21=21.2  @xmath19/f.u .",
    "@xcite although these two sets of experimental data differ slightly and further experimental study is needed , one can notice that gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 in the rhombohedral phase has the higher values of magnetic characteristics , than in the hexagonal one .",
    "motivated by this fact , in the paper we consider how the transfer from the rhombohedral to hexagonal structures in gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 influences the values of the local magnetic moments and exchange interaction parameters .",
    "the later values are obtained using the results of electronic structure calculations within lsda+@xmath0 method .",
    "further values of curie temperature were estimated in the framework of the weiss mean - field theory .",
    "moreover based on these calculations we propose explanation of rather low @xmath3 values and relatively small saturation magnetization of @xmath4fe@xmath2 series with respect to elemental @xmath22 fe .",
    "the intermetallic compound gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 can crystallize both in the rhombohedral @xmath15-type structure ( space group r@xmath23 m  no . 166 in international tables for crystallography ) and",
    "the hexagonal @xmath16-type crystal structure ( space group p6@xmath24/mmc  no .",
    "main structural blocks are iron hexagons building layers .",
    "most of these hexagons have empty centers , whereas others contain the rare - earth gd ions or mediate the fe ions in dumbbell positions .    the rhombohedral structure of the @xmath15-type is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "in this type of structure the fe(18@xmath25 ) hexagons ( let us denote fe(18@xmath25 ) as fe3 for the rhombohedral structure ) contain the gd ions in positions 6@xmath26 either at the center of each hexagon , as it is presented in the upper and lower layers in fig .",

    ". unit cell of the rhombohedral structure consists of one formula unit of gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 .",
    "the hexagonal structure of the @xmath16-type is shown in fig .",
    "in contrast with the rhombohedral structure , there are no layers where each hexagon contains the gd ion . in this structure",
    "the gd ions are located only at the centers of the hexagons ( let us denote fe(12@xmath29)=fe3 for the hexagonal structure ) alternating with the hexagons with the dumbbells of fe(4@xmath25 ) ( fe(4@xmath25)=fe1 ) , and the layers with the hexagons containing gd at each center are absent .",
    "moreover , here one can find the alternating intermediate layers fe(6@xmath30)=fe2 and fe(12@xmath31)=fe4 without the gd ions .",
    "unit cell of this structure consists of two formula units of gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 due to the different symmetry of the rare - earth ions coordination environment in the @xmath32-plane translations .    for both structures in the layers with alternating gd - containing and empty hexagons fe3 ,",
    "these hexagons are deformed  the hexagons with gd are slightly expanded , the hexagons without gd  contracted .",
    "furthermore , because for the hexagons fe2 and fe4 the intermediate layers the gd ion and the dumbbell fe1 ions are alternating from one layer to another , so the ions fe2 and fe4 in these layers are slightly distorted upward and downward with respect to the plane , i.e. these layers are slightly corrugated .",
    "the electronic structure of the rhombohedral structure of gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 was calculated in the lsda+@xmath0 method ( ref .  ) in the framework of the band calculation package tb - lmto - asa ( tight - binding , linear muffin - tin orbitals , atomic sphere approximation ) .",
    "@xcite however let us mention here that only gd 4f - shell was treated within the lsda+@xmath0 method since correlation effects are much stronger there than for the fe 3d - shell ( @xmath337  ev ( see below ) , @xmath342  ev@xcite ) .",

    "in the framework of spin - fluctuation theory of magnetism it was found@xcite that the magnetic behavior of transition metals can be described by the heisenberg model with long - range exchange interactions between classical spin vectors , in general , their magnitudes are non - integer .",

    "@xcite the only exception from this regularity is the fe3 class with the nearest neighbor fe3-type ion at @xmath89=3.563  @xmath38 between the first and second coordination layers .",

    "@xcite this conclusion also follows from our results for the hexagonal structure of gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 , see table  [ tab3 ] ( for the rhombohedral structure see table  [ tab5 ] ) , where the exchange interaction of the fe ions with the neighbors of the second - order coordination layer mostly change their sign and become negative , antiferromagnetic .",
    "exact account of these oscillating interactions requires either exact functional form of the exchange distance dependence for a particular pair of ions ( e.g. , fe1-fe3 ) , or calculation of the exchange parameters for such a pair on the scale of a few oscillations . at the moment",
    "the method of ref .",
    "allows one to calculate the exchange parameters , but it is not clear how to present an explicit functional dependence of the exchange on distance . nevertheless , in principle in this method one can calculate exchange parameters on the scale of a few oscillations , but for a metallic magnet with several types of magnetic moments and complicated crystal structure it is a cumbersome problem .",
    "secondly , also according to spin - fluctuation theory in metals ,  @xcite the exchange parameters of the classical heisenberg hamiltonian in the general case are temperature dependent .",
    "for this reason , the exchange parameters at @xmath67=0 and @xmath67=@xmath3 differ , whereas in our calculations we estimated @xmath3 from the exchange parameters calculated using the @xmath67=0 method of ref . .",
    "thirdly , an obvious limitation of such calculations is the weiss mean - field theory , restricted in its accuracy .    before we summarize",
    "let us also compare magnetic properties of elemental @xmath22 fe to ones averaged over first coordination sphere of fe ions of hexagonal gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 .",
    "first of all value of nearest neighbor exchange interaction of @xmath22 fe ( 393.2  k ,  ref .  ;",
    "373.6  k ,  ref .  ) is four times larger than the above mentioned averaged value of gd@xmath1fe@xmath2  ( 99.6  k , ref .  ) .",
    "it can be understood from difference of the nearest neighbor distance of @xmath22 fe ( 2.482   ) and averaged distance of gd@xmath1fe@xmath2  ( 2.574   , ref .  ) . thus hexagonal gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 has more loose - packed crystal structure than @xmath22 fe .",
    "this more loose - packed crystal structure also leads to a smaller saturation magnetization at @xmath67=0 of fe ion sublattice in hexagonal gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 ( 1299  g ,  ref .  ) in contrast to @xmath22 fe ( 1740  g ,  ref .  ) .",

    "similar results can be obtained for rhombohedral phase of gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 .",

    "is mostly antiferromagnetic one .",
    "latter one is consistent with rkky exchange picture ( exchange sign depends on pair bond length ) .",
    "@xcite however such competition only is not enough to decrease significantly curie temperature @xmath3 of @xmath4fe@xmath2 as proposed if ref .  .",
    "also it was reported before that exchange value between fe in dumbbell positions is the determinating factor for the @xmath3 value@xcite .",
    "however in this paper we showed that there are several exchange interactions almost of the same strength as dumbbell one , e.g. @xmath119 ( see tab .  [ tab2 ] ) .",
    "let us also roughly analyze values of exchange interactions in terms of crystal structure .",
    "collecting data from tables  [ tab2]-[tab5 ] one can observe for both phases analogous tendency .",
    "exchanges within any layer are weaker than interlayer ones .",
    "exceptional is only fe2 ion surrounded with four fe4 ions with exchange @xmath120 .",
    "anisotropy of direct exchange interaction parameters in the first coordination sphere comes from fe-3d orbitals overlap anisotropy . on top of that rkky exchange",
    "gives slight modulations in the first coordination sphere because of complexity of the fermi surface of the compounds .",
    "for the second coordination sphere rkky is main contribution to exchange interaction but for the reason mentioned above is also highly anisotropic .",

    "the fact that for both hexagonal gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 and @xmath22 fe local magnetic moments of fe ion are almost identical , exchange interaction values of @xmath22 fe is four times stronger then for hexagonal gd@xmath1fe@xmath2@xcite .",
    "it comes from more dense packing of fe ions of @xmath22 fe compared to hexagonal gd@xmath1fe@xmath2@xcite .",
    "the same arguments support lower saturation magnetization value for gd@xmath1fe@xmath2 .",
