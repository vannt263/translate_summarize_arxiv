    "the study of the decays of a nucleon resonance ( @xmath4 ) into a nucleon ( @xmath5 ) and a vector meson ( @xmath6 ) is closely related to several aspects of intermediate and high energy physics , ranging from resolving the so - called `` missing '' resonance problem  @xcite to estimating the medium modifications on the vector meson properties  @xcite",
    ". electromagnetic production of vector mesons is one of the most promising reactions to determine the @xmath7 couplings experimentally , e.g. , at thomas jefferson national accelerator facility , elsa - saphir of bonn , graal of grenoble , and leps of spring-8 .",
    "the @xmath0 meson photoproduction has some advantages because the non - resonant contribution to its total amplitude is much better understood as compared with the other vector mesons@xcite .",
    "the role of the nucleon resonances in @xmath0 meson photoproduction at relatively large energy was studied by zhao _",
    "@xcite , using the @xmath8 constituent quark model with an effective quark - meson interaction . by fitting the model parameters to the existing data",
    ", they found that the single polarization observables are sensitive to the nucleon resonances and the dominant contribution at @xmath9 gev comes from the `` missing '' @xmath10 resonance .",
    "a recent analysis@xcite of @xmath0 photoproduction in the same energy region makes use of the constituent quark model  @xcite , which accounts for the configuration mixing due to the residual quark - quark interactions  @xcite . in  @xcite the dominant contributions",
    "are found to be from @xmath11 , a missing resonance , and @xmath12 , which is identified as the @xmath13 of the particle data group(pdg )  @xcite . as a result ,",
    "the predicted single polarizations are rather different from those of  @xcite .",
    "hopefully , the data from near future will clarify the situation .",
    "it would be important to extend these studies to the low energy region , @xmath14 gev , close to the omega production threshold , where the well established three- and four - star nucleon resonances are expected to be important .",
    "unfortunately neither the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , nor of ref .",
    "@xcite could be applied for this investigation .",
    "the first approach@xcite does not include the configuration mixing .",
    "therefore , the predicted low - lying @xmath4 states , belonging to the @xmath15 $ ] representation , can not contribute to the resonance photo excitation on the proton target because of the moorhouse selection rule . that is , the contributions from @xmath16 , and @xmath17 resonances are strictly suppressed  @xcite .",
    "this contradicts with the experimental data  @xcite , which , for example , shows that photo excitation helicity amplitude @xmath18 for @xmath19 resonance is finite and large .",
    "in general , one finds that the su(6)@xmath20o(3 ) quark model without configuration mixing forbids or suppresses most of the low mass resonances .",
    "while the second approach@xcite makes use of the information from the constituent quark model with configuration mixing , the @xmath21 transition amplitudes for the low - lying @xmath4 s with mass less than 1.72 gev are not available in ref.@xcite .",
    "to provide such information , some extensions of the @xmath22 model employed in ref.@xcite for predicting @xmath21 are necessary .    as a possible solution of the problems mentioned above , we will follow the previous studies of @xmath23  @xcite and @xmath24-photoproduction  @xcite and apply the effective lagrangian approach to also describe the @xmath4 excitation .",
    "our approach is similar to the recent work by riska and brown@xcite , but with several significant differences .",
    "they fix the @xmath25 effective lagrangians for the low mass resonances with @xmath26 mev by using the matrix elements derived from the su(6)@xmath20o(3 ) constituent quark model with no configuration mixing . for the reasons mentioned above , an extension of their approach to also define the effective lagrangian for",
    "@xmath27 coupling will be unrealistic because of the restriction of the su(6)@xmath20o(3 ) quark model .",
    "thus their model is not applicable to a consistent investigation using effective lagrangian approach . in this work",
    ", we will start with the empirical @xmath27 amplitudes and then predict the needed @xmath21 coupling constants by using the vector meson dominance assumption .",
    "this is similar to a recent work by post and mosel@xcite .",
    "but we will use a fully covariant formulation and explore in more detail the consequesncies of this approach .    to proceed , we need to also consider non - resonant mechanisms .",
    "it is fairly well established that the @xmath0 meson photoproduction is dominated by diffractive processes at high energies and by the one - pion exchange and the standard nucleon born terms at low energies .",
    "the diffractive part is associated with the pomeron exchange . in the near threshold energy",
    "the pomeron exchange contribution is negligible and can be safely neglected in this work .",

    "[ fig:4 ] the beam asymmetry calculated from keeping only the @xmath113 term in the resonant amplitude .",
    "we see that the main feature of the beam asymmetry can be obtained ( dashed and dot - dashed curves ) from the interference between this resonance state and the non - resonant amplitude .",
    "the next large contribution comes from the excitation of @xmath110 , @xmath19 and @xmath115 states .",
    "their role in determining the beam asymmetry is rather different .",
    "the @xmath110 resonance gives constructive interference with @xmath113 , while the @xmath244 excitations interfere destructively and reduce the absolute value of asymmetry .    with the model ii constructed above ,",
    "we perform calculations at @xmath245 @xmath246 , @xmath247 , and @xmath248 gev for future experimental tests .",
    "the predicted differential cross sections are the thick solid curves shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] . here",
    ", we also show the contributions from various mechanisms illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "one can see that the contributions from the direct and crossed nucleon terms(short dashed curves ) and @xmath4 excitations(dashed curves ) are instrumental in getting differential cross sections which are much flatter than those calculated from keeping only the pseudo scalar meson exchange ( thin solid curves ) .",
    "the predicted beam asymmetries , @xmath81 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] .",
    "the calculations keeping only the non - resonant amplitude yield almost zero asymmetries(dot - dashed curves ) .",
    "inclusion of the resonance excitation results in negative asymmetry , in agreement with the data at @xmath249 and @xmath247 gev .    in figs .",
    "[ fig:7],[fig:8 ] we depict the predicted target asymmetry(@xmath82 ) and recoil asymmetry(@xmath83 ) .",
    "again , one can see that resonance excitation results in large deviations from the pure non - resonant limit(dot - dashed curves ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:9 ] we show our predictions for the tensor @xmath250 asymmetry calculated in the gottfried - jackson system .",
    "the dot - dashed curves are calculated from keeping only the non - resonant amplitudes .",
    "clearly , these are close to the value @xmath251 of eq.([vgj ] ) due to only the pseudoscalar meson exchange .",
    "the resonance excitations enhance greatly the contribution from the longitudinally polarized outgoing @xmath0 mesons and hence bring @xmath250 to negative values .",
    "the predicted double beam - target asymmetry is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] . here",
    "we see even more dramatic effects due to @xmath4 excitations .",
    "the non - resonant amplitude yields positive asymmetry . adding the resonant contributions , the asymmetries at low @xmath252 become negative and have very different dependence on scattering angles .",
    "the results presented above obviously reflect the consequences of the not - well - determined @xmath157 coupling constants .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare our values with those determined in the recent works by post and mosel  @xcite , lutz , wolf and friman  @xcite , and riska and brown  @xcite .",
    "the form of the effective lagrangians given in ref.@xcite can be obtained from our expressions by making the non - relativistic reductions . in this case",
    "the comparison can be made easily .",
    "for other two cases their relations with ours are not obvious because of the use of different couplings schemes .",
    "however , by making the non - relativistic reductions and keeping the leading terms which would be dominant near the @xmath0 production threshold , we can cast our lagrangians into their forms and the comparisons of the coupling constants can then be made .",
