    "inflation was originally proposed to solve the initial condition problem of standard big bang cosmology . at the same time",
    ", it was found that inflation typically leads to a nearly scale invariant spectrum of scalar and tensor fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "it is this finding , which is so well confirmed by the observed anisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background  @xcite , which has led to a wide acceptance of the inflationary paradigm . using present and future cmb data , in combination with other cosmological data sets , we are now in the position to constrain models .",
    "typically , an inflationary model predicts the value of three parameters , namely the scalar spectral index @xmath4 , the tensor spectral index @xmath5 , and the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath6 .",
    "so far , observations just provide upper limits on tensor fluctuations .",
    "these are not independent of the scalar spectral index @xmath4 as it is evident from the 2-dimensional one- and two-@xmath7 confidence contours , shown in fig .  5 of ref .",
    "these data can be used to constrain inflationary models .",
    "for example , in  @xcite it is noted that a model of inflation with a scalar field potential of the form @xmath8 is ruled out if the number @xmath9 of e - foldings of inflation after horizon crossing of the scales probed by wmap , @xmath10mpc @xmath11 , is of the order of @xmath12  @xmath13 . in this expression , @xmath14 is the current value of the hubble parameter and @xmath15 .",
    "this is a truly breath taking result meaning that cmb data , i.e. cosmological observations on the largest scales , can provide information about the physics at energy scales much higher than those attainable in the laboratory , hence about the physics on the smallest scales .",
    "it is therefore of the utmost importance that these results are subjected to the deepest scrutiny . with this point in mind , we have studied the recent works @xcite-@xcite . in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the author argues that the inflationary power spectra , as they are usually calculated , are not correct .",
    "in fact , since they diverge at coincident points , one should subtract an appropriate adiabatic counterterm ( see also @xcite for a different point of view ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors perform explicit calculations along these lines , and subtract the adiabatic term at the hubble exit , namely when @xmath16 . as a result ,",
    "the values of the tensor - to - scalar ratio that they find , differ significantly from the ones usually adopted to be compared with the data , @xcite .",
    "the most surprising consequence is that , for example , the chaotic inflationary model @xmath8 is no longer ruled out by the wmap data .",
    "it is well known that the standard power spectra are nearly time - independent on super - hubble scales , i.e. when @xmath17 . in this paper",
    "we show that this is not the case for the adiabatic contribution to the spectra in a realistic model of inflation .",
    "the renormalized spectra , no matter the approach used for the adiabatic subtraction , always depend on @xmath18 .",
    "the adiabatic regularization , even when performed at horizon exit or a few hubble times later , is ambiguous in the sense that it gives different result depending on which approach is used . in some cases , the result is even strongly time - dependent .",
    "in fact , we show that there are different ways to perform the adiabatic subtraction , which all agree in the far ultraviolet regime , but yield very different results for @xmath19 .",
    "the most reasonable adiabatic expression actually yields an adiabatic spectrum @xmath20 such that the ratio @xmath21 becomes quickly negligible for @xmath2 , indicating that the spectrum is not modified .",
    "these considerations indicate that the correct time at which the adiabatic subtraction has to be performed is the end of inflation , rather than the time of hubble exit .",
    "however , at the end of inflation all the modes relevant for observational cosmology are in the far infrared region where the adiabatic expansion seems not appropriate as the expansion of the universe is not slow compared to the oscillation frequency of the mode and , thus , not adiabatic . if one insists , however , to extend the adiabatic regularization in the infrared , we present an argument , which shows that the adiabatic counterterms become negligible anyway",
    "thus , we shall argue that the physical result is not affected by adiabatic regularization .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we present approximate expressions for the scalar and tensor power spectra in the framework of slow - roll inflation . in section",

    "the main point of this section is that adiabatic subtraction is not a reliable technique in the ir .",
    "in fact , we have presented three types of counterterms for the scalar spectrum , eqs .",

    "( [ ptfull ] ) and ( [ ptuv ] ) . in each case , these terms are equivalent in the far uv but give very different results elsewhere .",
    "furthermore , we have shown that when using ( [ pzfull ] ) and ( [ ptfull ] ) , the subtracted spectra are close to the bare ones already at @xmath3 and virtually identical to them at @xmath132 .",
    "in this paper we have first determined the renormalized perturbation spectra in a slow - roll inflationary model in uv domain . in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite , we have found that adiabatic subtraction can lead to a substantial reduction of power in the uv .",
    "namely , the larger @xmath133 in comparison to @xmath134 , the closer the weight of the adiabatic counterterm becomes to the unrenormalized spectra .",
    "this is reasonable , since we do not expect that the expansion of the universe is `` energetic enough '' to excite physical modes in the uv .    on the contrary , in the ir ,",
    "the adiabatic expansion is no longer valid , and there is no convincing physical argument to subtract this term to the standard power spectrum . as there is a natural ir cutoff to inflation , we propose that for cosmologically relevant scales , which have been amplified by inflation but which are in the far ir at the end of inflation , no adiabatic subtraction should be performed .",
    "one might argue , however , that this expansion scheme still produces a finite result and therefore provides a way to renormalize the ir modes .",
    "in fact , we find this argument not convincing , as there are different schemes to renormalize the ir modes ( for example , see the recent paper @xcite ) . in a way , we have also shown this by presenting different counterterms which agree in the far uv but not in the ir .",
    "this reflects the well known result that , in the far uv , where space - time curvature becomes negligible , the physical spectrum is independent of the regularization scheme , and that the uv singularity structure of the two - point function is always of the hadamard form .",
    "furthermore , since inflation has not started in the infinite past , there is a natural infrared cutoff , namely the horizon scale at the beginning of inflation .",
    "we therefore conclude that one should not subtract the adiabatic contribution in the ir in realistic inflationary models .",
    "even though the adiabatic calculation does not apply in the ir , it is interesting to note that , the adiabatic counterterms become much smaller than the unrenormalized spectrum in the ir , when computed without any expansion , as in eqs .",
    "( [ pzfull ] ) and ( [ ptfull ] ) .",
    "as mentioned above , these expressions show a singularity for @xmath135 .",
    "this is not relevant , from our point of view , as we claim that the subtraction should be performed at the end of inflation . at the end of inflation , however , all cosmologically relevant scales are in the far ir , hence the adiabatic subtraction , which is a possible prescription for the far uv does not affect the associated spectra .",
    "this is the main conclusion of this work .",
    "the adiabatic subtraction does , however provide a clean means to derive the shape of the physical spectrum in the uv , where it actually tends to zero : at any given time , fluctuations with @xmath136 are significantly suppressed by the adiabatic counterterm . in this sense",
    "the adiabatic subtraction provides a uv cutoff of the spectrum which is roughly given by the scale @xmath137 which reaches @xmath3 at the end of inflation , @xmath138 .",
    "the reason why it is usually sensible to compute @xmath117 and @xmath139 at the hubble exit , @xmath140 instead of evaluating them at the end of inflation , is that we have simple and sound formulae for them , which are valid `` inside the hubble scale '' , while the growing modes of the perturbations are nearly constant `` outside the hubble scale '' .",
    "therefore , in general we do not need to calculate their evolution until the end of inflation .",
    "this is different for the adiabatic counterterm @xmath20 : as we have shown , this term becomes strongly time - dependent , and decreases with @xmath18 in the ir , if extended in this regime without any further expansion .",
    "therefore , it seems reasonable to perform the adiabatic subtraction at the end of inflation , or at least far in the ir , where , however , it becomes irrelevant for all scales of cosmological interest .",
