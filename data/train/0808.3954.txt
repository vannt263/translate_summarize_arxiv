    "many dynamical processes have been shown to possess coexisting metastable states , and their dynamics can be highly sensitive to the initial conditions .",
    "some examples include neural behaviour  @xcite , rain events  @xcite , earthquakes dynamics  @xcite , effective fractal dimension of energy levels  @xcite , among others .",
    "their correct interpretation requires an understanding of dynamical systems with very low dissipation , lying in between the strongly dissipative limit and the conservative one . in spite of the importance of this problem ,",
    "there are few systematic studies of the low - dissipation limit and the transition from dissipative to conservative dynamics .",
    "this is the problem we address in this paper .    in hamiltonian systems ,",
    "chaotic regions typically coexist with regions of regular motion around the marginally stable periodic orbits , also known as kolmogorov - arnold - moser ( kam ) invariant tori .",
    "chaotic trajectories have intermittent behaviour and spend long times sporadically near the border of regular islands .",
    "this stickiness to the kam tori makes their dynamics fundamentally different from that of hyperbolic chaotic systems , since even small islands can exert great influence on the global dynamics  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "strongly dissipative systems are characterised as having only one or few attractors to which all the initial conditions eventually converge .",
    "these two regimes could not be more different from each other ; however , if the dissipation decreases to zero , the phase space structure of the dissipative systems must evolve in such a way as to approach the complex hierarchical organisation found in hamiltonian systems .",
    "how this transformation occurs is far from obvious .",
    "despite the existence of extensive investigations on strongly dissipative and on hamiltonian systems , very little is known about properties of systems close to the border between dissipative and conservative dynamics , where many coexisting periodic attractors are present  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate the growth of the number of periodic attractors and how the topology of the phase space evolves when the dissipation is reduced .",
    "we obtain numerically a power law describing the growth of the number of periodic attractors as the damping approaches zero .",
    "when the system is close to the hamiltonian limit , we find that high - period periodic attractors become increasingly important in the system s dynamics , in contrast to the case with high dissipation .",
    "these _ emerging attractors _ proliferate ever more rapidly as the dissipation decreases .",
    "moreover , we argue that although this number can be extremely high for small dissipation , we expect it to be finite ( for non - zero dissipation ) , as conjectured recently  @xcite .",
    "the power law of the number of attractors with dissipation , found in this work , corroborates this conjecture .",
    "another important finding in this paper is that for low levels of damping the dynamics is characterised by _ effective invariants _ , a concept previously used in the context of non - hyperbolic dynamics of hamiltonian systems  @xcite .",
    "we study specifically the _ effective fractal dimension _ , which we show to depend on the scale and also on the region of the phase space .",
    "therefore we show that effective dynamics is relevant also for dissipative systems , and not only for hamiltonian ones .",
    "this paper is organised as follows .",
    "we start , with sec .",
    "[ sec.n - of - att ] , where we introduce the dynamical systems used in our analysis and revisit the problem of the number of coexistent periodic attractors .",
    "it is followed , sec .",
    "[ sec.topology ] , by a discussion regarding the topology of the phase space in the low - dissipation limit . in sec .",
    "[ sec.effective ] we introduce effective invariants and define the effective fractal dimension for weakly dissipative systems .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "[ sec.conclu ] brings our conclusions . in the appendix",
    ", we bring up some formal definitions .",
    "in particular , we recall a definition of _ periodic attractors _ , and discuss its implications for both experimental and numerical realistic investigations , where one typically is only able to make use of limited precision .",
    "we also recall a definition of _ basin of attraction _ , which is coherent with the definition of periodic attractors used here .",
    "a paradigmatic system that allows the investigation of the transition from the dissipative to the conservative limit is the _ single rotor map _ , obtained from the mechanical pendulum kicked periodically at times @xmath0 , @xmath1 , with force @xmath2  @xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 $ ] corresponds to the phase , @xmath5 to the angular velocity , and @xmath6 $ ] is the damping parameter . for @xmath7 , the well known area preserving standard map analysed by chirikov",
    "@xcite is recovered . for @xmath8",
    ", we obtain the circle map with zero rotation number .",
    "previous work has considered the question of the number of attractors for this system  @xcite .",
    "they have derived an analytical expression for the number of period-1 primary attractors , that have not undergone period doubling bifurcation : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the integer part of the expression in brackets . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , numerical detection of attractors with high period is a difficult task .",
    "the reason is the extremely small size of their basins of attraction , what requires computation using very fine grids . adding to this , they have short lifetime in the space of parameters .",
    "therefore it is necessary to follow a great number of initial conditions in order to be able to detect them .",
    ", as a function of the number of initial conditions randomly chosen in @xmath11 and evolved according to the map .",
    "the parameters for the map ( [ eq.single-rotor-map ] ) were @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . ]    here we overcome this problem . instead of choosing an _ a priori _ fixed number of initial conditions in a preset grid , as previously done in ref .",
    "@xcite and elsewhere , we fix the non linearity @xmath14 for a given damping @xmath15 and then iterate an ensemble of randomly chosen initial conditions with uniform distribution on a bounded region of the phase space .",
    "therefore , the chance for an attractor to be found does not depend on our particular choice of the grid . for the dissipative case the dynamics takes place in the cylinder @xmath16 \\times \\mathbb{r}$ ] and the area where the initial conditions are chosen depends on the damping . since @xmath17 , from the second equation in the map ( [ eq.single-rotor-map ] ) , one gets @xmath18 ,",
    "so if @xmath19 , with @xmath20 \\times [ -y_{max},y_{max}]$ ] , where @xmath21 .    .",
    "the parameters were @xmath12 , for the single rotor map , and @xmath22 for the hnon map .",
    "it is also shown the power laws fits , the black and the red solid lines for the single rotor map and for the hnon map , respectively ; compare to the number of period 1 attractors expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq.urike-attrac ] ) ( black dashed line ) for the single rotor map .",
    "the divergence from this curve ( dashed black line ) to the other ( black solid line ) is clear , showing the important contribution of high period periodic attractors in the regime of small damping for the single rotor map . ]    in order to detect the attractors , even with very small basins of attraction , we keep iterating new , randomly chosen initial conditions @xmath23 until their trajectories converge to some periodic attractor .",
    "we use up to @xmath24 iterations ; independently of the damping , this provides a convergence of more than @xmath25 of the initial conditions .",
    "we have ignored the remaining trajectories ( which may include chaotic orbits ) , regarding them as not being statistically representative .",
    "it is known that for this and similar systems , almost all attractors consist of periodic orbits .",
    "we keep iterating new initial conditions until we fail to find new attractors .",
    "this was determined by the criterion that whenever the total number of detected attractors did not change for the last @xmath26 initial conditions , we assume that all the detectable attractors have been found .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.condxattrac ] for @xmath13 .",
    "we repeat this procedure for different values of @xmath15 , in order to find how the total number of periodic attractors changes with damping .",
    "notice that the area of the phase space where the trajectories are trapped grows as we decrease @xmath15 ; for @xmath27 for example , we need @xmath28 initial conditions to find most attractors in the system .    the question regarding the finiteness of the number of attractors and their density in phase space has been considered before and it is widely regarded as one of the most important open problems still to be answered in dynamical systems theory  @xcite . among many conjectures , it has been initially proposed that the number of attractors was infinite  @xcite .",
    "afterwards it has been proved that this should only hold for a zero measure set of parameter values , though dense in some interval  @xcite .",
    "recently it has also been conjectured by palis that the total number of attractors should be finite  @xcite .    to investigate this issue using our system ( [ eq.single-rotor-map ] ) as a testing ground",
    ", we calculate the number of attractors as described above , and see how this depends on the dissipation @xmath15 as it is decreased and approaches the conservative limit , i.e. @xmath29 . figure [ fig.compa-attrac ] shows a _ log - log _ plot of our data , yielding a power law describing the dependence of the total number of periodic attractors on @xmath15 .",
    "numerical fitting gives us the following law : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the total number of detected periodic attractors for the map  ( [ eq.single-rotor-map ] ) .",
    "now we want to compare our power law for the growth of the total number of periodic attractors with the formula ( [ eq.urike-attrac ] )  @xcite for the number of period 1 attractors .",
    "we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig.compa-attrac ] that when the damping is decreased the contribution of higher period periodic attractors becomes important for the total number of detected attractors .",
    "the main reason is that the _ lifetime _ of a stable , periodic orbit in parameter space increases as damping is reduced . by _ lifetime _ of an orbit we mean the range in parameter space for which the orbit exists , without undergoing any bifurcation . since the higher the period of an attractor , the smaller its lifetime interval in parameter space  @xcite , the extension of lifetime for small damping promotes the overlap of different periodic orbits in the space of parameters , which was not possible before .",
    "equation ( [ eq.urike-attrac ] ) is only valid within the parameter intervals where none of the period @xmath32 attractors has undergone period doubling  @xcite . since some of the period @xmath32 attractors may have gone through such process for the parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig.compa-attrac ] , the difference between the expected number of period @xmath32 attractors and the total number of attractors can be even larger than that inferred from the above argument .",
    "we further investigated the growth of the number of periodic attractors for a map of a different class than the previous one .",
    "we chose the hnon map in the form  @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 represents the bifurcation or non linearity control parameter .",
    "the parameter @xmath6 $ ] represents the damping parameter . when @xmath8 , the two equations in eq .",
    "[ eq.henon-map ] are no longer coupled , and we obtain the quadratic map . for the other limit , @xmath35 , we have a conservative map , hence the determinant of its jacobian matrix is equal to @xmath32 .",
    "contrary to the case for the map  ( [ eq.single-rotor-map ] ) , the dynamics for the hnon map  ( [ eq.henon-map ] ) is not _ a priori _ contained within a region of the phase space . for a range of parameters , the initial conditions can either be trapped by some of the coexistent periodic attractors , or be scattered .",
    "in fact , most of the initial conditions diverge to infinity .",
    "we repeated the procedure applied to the previous map in order to obtain the number of periodic attractors for the hnon map .",
    "we fixed @xmath22 for the map ( [ eq.henon-map ] ) , and we iterated a set of initial conditions in @xmath36 \\times [ -5 , 5]$ ] verifying whether they converged to some periodic attractor or diverged . because the number of initial conditions converging to periodic attractors is much smaller than that diverging , in order to obtain about @xmath37 initial conditions converging to periodic motion , as many as @xmath38 initial conditions were necessary depending on the damping .",
    "figure  [ fig.compa-attrac ] shows a _ log - log _ plot of our data , yielding a power law describing the dependence of the total number of periodic attractors on @xmath15 . for the hnon map ,",
    "the numerical fitting produces : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total number of detected periodic attractors for the map  ( [ eq.henon-map ] ) .",
    "as previously observed  @xcite , the hnon map belongs to a class of dynamical systems whose the conservative element has few primary island , which are surrounded by secondary ones .",
    "therefore , although it also observed the coexistence of periodic attractors for a range of parameter , it is expected this number to be smaller than that for the single rotor s family .",
    "even though we can not claim the above result to be a mathematical proof , our results seem to uphold palis conjectures  @xcite , i.e. , for any arbitrarily small @xmath41 , the limit of eqs .",
    "( [ eq.power-law ] ) , [ ( [ eq.power-law-h ] ) ] , as @xmath42}}$ ] predicts a finite number of attractors for the system , though this number can be very high for small @xmath43 ( @xmath31 , and @xmath40 for the single rotor map , and for the hnon map , respectively ) .    although some attractors may have their basins of attraction so tiny that even by iterating a huge number of initial conditions is not enough to numerically detect them .",
    "figure  [ fig.condxattrac ] shows that the number of attractors which was detected is asymptotic to a constant ( we obtain a similar figure for the hnon map ) .",
    "therefore , our results indicate that the number of attractors increases as a power law as the dissipation decreases , being finite for any given @xmath17 , though arbitrarily large for @xmath15 approaching zero . even though the specific value of the exponent in eq .",
    "( [ eq.power-law ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq.power-law-h ] ) may be only valid for the map ( [ eq.single-rotor-map ] ) , and the map ( [ eq.henon-map ] ) , respectively , the growth of the number of periodic attractors is a very generic property of weakly dissipative systems  @xcite which should not depend on the details of the system , since in the low - dissipative limit the system s phase - space approaches that of hamiltonian systems , which have universal properties . we therefore expect that the same behaviour to hold for other systems .    the natural question which arises",
    "is the following : what happens to the topology of the phase space as new attractors continually appear with decreasing damping ?",
    "we start this section by presenting a qualitative picture of the transformations occurring in phase space structure when the damping is decreased . for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the map  ( [ eq.single-rotor-map ] ) . although one can not draw definitive conclusions from this qualitative analysis , it motivates us to some further quantitative investigation , which will be tackled at the end of this section and in the next one . in order to get some clue about which topological changes occur when the damping is decreased , we begin by looking at the phase space for the system with constant forcing and high damping . in this case",
    "the system has only few periodic attractors .",
    "we decrease then @xmath15 , find the periodic attractors for the new parameter and plot their basins of attraction .",
    "since we are now only interested in the general picture , the number of initial conditions is fixed at @xmath44 .",
    "if we follow the distributions of filaments of the largest basin of attraction in the phase space , we notice that their structure becomes more heterogeneous for different regions when the damping is decreased .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.phasespace ] , where each colour ( colour online ) represents a set of initial conditions which converge to one of the attractors , i.e. , different colours represent different basins of attraction . in fig .",
    "[ fig.phasespace ] ( a ) , for which @xmath45 , we notice that the largest basin of attraction ( in black ) is spread out over the phase space in an intricate structure .",
    "moreover , if we compare distinct regions of the phase space , there is a qualitative difference in the `` density '' of filaments of the largest basin of attraction . in particular , the farther the region is from the main attractor , the thinner the filaments become . in fig .",
    "[ fig.phasespace ] ( b ) , for @xmath46 , we detect five attractors and the topology of the phase space , i.e. , the spatial distribution of invariant sets , seems to become more complex .",
    "going even further , for @xmath47 in fig .",
    "[ fig.phasespace ] ( c ) , we have seven attractors in the same region and the difference of density of those filaments is clearer .",
    "figure  [ fig.phasespace ] ( d ) is the blow up of the region @xmath48 , y \\in [ -15,-10]$ ] for @xmath47 .",
    "the rescaling of the phase space shows the structure of the basins which seems to form a self similar pattern , as illustrated in fig .",

    ".  [ fig.phasespace ] ( d ) , showing the fractal cantor structure . ]     and",
    "the black points represent initial conditions which converge to the attractor formed from the main island .",
    "the initial conditions were chosen such that , @xmath50 \\times [ -\\pi ,      \\pi]$ ] .",
    "we used the same parameters as those used in ref  @xcite . ]    [ fig.basin ]    as we decrease the damping even further , this process seems to carry on and the heterogeneity of the phase space keeps increasing .",
    "furthermore , the difference in density of filaments of distinct regions of the phase space is seen by looking , for instance , at the largest basin of attraction for @xmath51 , and @xmath12 . for these parameters we expect from eq .",
    "( [ eq.power-law ] ) to find about 140 periodic attractors .",
    "the largest basin of attraction is responsible for about @xmath52 of the initial conditions @xmath50 \\times [ -\\pi , \\pi]$ ]  @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.basin ] , which has been done by the iteration of an ensemble of @xmath26 initial conditions .",
    "the structures we just presented are nothing but manifestations of some of the underlying invariant sets .",
    "that is , the dynamics has multiple periodic attractors , and the closure of the set of initial conditions that approaches a give attractor is its basin of attraction .",
    "the boundary which separates different basins of attraction is the basin boundary .",
    "this basin boundary is the stable manifold of an invariant set .",
    "if we define the boundary @xmath53 in some region of the phase space embedded in the boundary as @xmath54 , where @xmath55 denotes some open set in phase space which contains part of the boundary @xmath53 , we expect for a given @xmath15 the fractal dimension of the basin boundary , @xmath56 , to be constant at different regions of the phase space , @xmath57 , as it has been conjectured in ref .",
    "nevertheless , for physically relevant scales , the heterogeneity in the distribution of the basins over the phase space , and hence the spatially heterogeneous distribution of invariant manifolds , suggests that course - grained measurements of quantities such as the fractal dimension should lead to different results depending on the region of the phase space and on the scale under consideration .",
    "the reason is that realistic measurements never take the limit of infinitely small scales , but must have a finite lower scale .",
    "previous works in the context of hamiltonian systems show that when the phase space has a heterogeneous structure such as in this case , one needs to go to exceedingly small scales to approach the mathematical value of the fractal dimension , which is unique and independent of the portion of the phase space used to calculate it . for physically realistic scales , an approximation to the fractal dimension ( and similar quantities )",
    "is more appropriate to describe the system s dynamics ; this approximation , called the _ effective fractal dimension _ , depends on the position as well as on the scale under consideration .",
    "this effective fractal dimension will be presented in more detail in the next section .",
    "a finite - scale approximation of the fractal dimension of the basin boundary can be estimated using the uncertainty method  @xcite .",
    "it consists in iterating an ensemble of initial conditions @xmath58 and checking to which attractor they converge .",
    "then we add a small perturbation @xmath43 to every initial condition , say @xmath59 , and check whether they change from one basin to another .",
    "we count the fraction of initial conditions that have changed their asymptotic state after being perturbed in this manner .",
    "this fraction , @xmath60 of @xmath43-uncertain points is the fraction of initial conditions that change basins under an @xmath43-size perturbation , and it scales as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is related to the box counting dimension @xmath63 of the basin boundary by @xmath64 , where d is the dimension of the phase space ( for the map ( [ eq.single-rotor-map ] ) we have @xmath65 ) .     as a function of the perturbation size @xmath43 for two different regions of the phase space .",
    "the regions , @xmath66 , were defined as @xmath67 \\times [ -1.0 , -2.5]$ ] , and @xmath68 \\times [ 198.5 , 200.0]$ ] .",

    "[ fig.dimension ] we show the fraction of `` uncertain '' initial conditions as function of the size of perturbation @xmath43  @xcite .",
    "the slope of the curves are related to the fractal dimension of the basin boundary .",
    "the exponents @xmath70 can be computed over some decades .",
    "however , we notice in fig .",
    "[ fig.dimension ] that the slope assumes different values for distinct regions of the phase space .",
    "such regions , @xmath71 , are defined as @xmath72 \\times [ -1.0 , -2.5]$ ] , and @xmath73 \\times [ 198.5 , 200.0]$ ] , and they were chosen with the same lebesgue measure .",
    "we chose three different regions of the phase space , located at different distances from the main attractor .",
    "we remark that , although such regions may be out of @xmath74 defined in section  [ sec.n - of - att ] , it does not follow that they do not contain boundaries .",
    "this is because regions @xmath75 , defined for each value of @xmath15 , are portions of the phase space where the attractors are to be found ; their basins , on the other hand , are expected to be extended throughout the phase space .",
    "since the density of periodic attractors in phase space decreases when we look at regions farther away from the main attractor , we expect the stable manifold to be denser around the central part of the phase space .",
    "furthermore , given that we expect the dissipative regime to approach the complex structures of the hamiltonian dynamics at the zero dissipation limit , it is sensible to expect a distribution of manifolds which are similar for conservative and for low dissipative dynamics . for hamiltonian dynamics",
    ", the density of manifolds decreases as one looks at regions farther from the main island  @xcite .",
    "looking at fig .",
    "[ fig.dimension ] , it is clear that for @xmath76 , the estimated fractal dimension is larger for the region @xmath77 , where we expect the stable manifold to be less dense .",
    "only when we go down to @xmath78 does the slope for the region @xmath77 converges to the same value as the one of the region @xmath79 : for small enough @xmath43 , the slope eventually converges to the true fractal dimension , which has a unique value  @xcite .",
    "we have computed @xmath60 for even smaller values of @xmath15 , and we have observed the same behaviour . however , for values as small as @xmath51 , even going down to @xmath80 is not enough to obtain a convergence to a unique value of the estimated dimension in different regions .",
    "this shows that an effective dimension is indeed the relevant physical quantity to be considered also for weakly dissipative systems .",
    "from the theoretical results regarding the fractal dimension of the basin boundary  @xcite , we expect to have the same fractal dimension for different regions of the phase space .",
    "however , the above discussion and results suggest that , for realistic scales , the behaviour for weakly dissipative systems can be quite different from the asymptotic one .",
    "therefore it is sensible to describe the system in terms of _ effective _ invariants , a concept which has been used mostly in the context of non - hyperbolic hamiltonian dynamical systems .  @xcite . as an example of effective invariants we use the definition of effective fractal dimension for a @xmath81-dimensional system , which depends on the region @xmath82 , and on the scale under consideration  @xcite .",

    "we notice that for @xmath77 , where the stable manifold is less dense , starting from @xmath97 , the value of the effective fractal dimension is larger , but after few decades it converges to nearly the same as for @xmath79 , i.e. , @xmath98 , where the stable manifold is denser .",
    "the same phenomenon is observed for @xmath99 , though the convergence is faster than for @xmath77 .",
    "when we decrease @xmath15 , hence increasing the number of attractors , even for @xmath100 , which is almost in the limit of normal computation and far beyond realistic measurement capacity , we do observe different values of effective fractal dimension for different regions , as it is shown in fig .",

    "we say that a bounded and limited region of the phase space , i.e. @xmath109 is called a _ trapping region _ for @xmath103 if @xmath110 , where @xmath111 stands for the interior of @xmath112 .",
    "another important concept for the definition of _ attractors _ is the notion of @xmath113-_chain_. an @xmath113-_chain _ of length @xmath114 from @xmath115 to @xmath116 , for a map @xmath103 is a sequence @xmath117 , such that for all @xmath118 , we have @xmath119 .",
    "now we are ready to state a formal definition of _ periodic attractors_. if forward iterating our map @xmath103 in a trapping region , i.e. if we take the set @xmath120 , and we eventually end up in an unique closed sequence of points such as these points are an @xmath113-_chain _ no matter how small @xmath121 is , we have precisely what is defined as _ attractor_. in some other words , a periodic attractor is the unique sequence of points @xmath122 remaining by iterating a trapping region , such that @xmath123 , for all @xmath121 . in this case , we have _ period _ @xmath124 .",
    "notice that the attractivity of the attractor is ensured by requiring the existence of the trapping region .",
    "furthermore , we remark that , finding multiple periodic attractors require the coexistence of different trapping regions .",
    "although the formal definition of attractor requires the existence of such sequence of points , the @xmath113-_chain _",
    ", for all @xmath121 , and infinitely many iterations , both experimentally , and numerically , we are constrained by limited precision .",
    "hence we are forced to use a mild condition on @xmath113 .",
    "therefore , the number of periodic attractors obtained in realistic investigation intrinsically depends on the precision that we choose .",
    "we give a picturesque illustration of it in fig  [ fig.illust ] .",
    "on determining of the number of periodic attractors in this paper , we have used @xmath125 .",
    "nevertheless , it does not minimise the importance of ours findings , showing fundamental characteristics of the dynamics within realistic scale .    , and",
    "@xmath126 , with @xmath127 , or @xmath128 .",
    "hence , the attractors are of period two .",
    "if on the detection of such attractors , @xmath129 is used , only one attractor of period @xmath128 is detected .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath130 , we are able to distinguish them . ]",
    "we also use a more general definition of _ basin of attraction_. the _ basin of attraction _ of some trapping region @xmath131 is the set of positive lebesgue measure of initial conditions , whose orbits eventually enter @xmath131 , as defined in ref .  @xcite . note that this slightly different definition avoids problems of coherence for not having an infinitely small @xmath113 .",
    "because any periodic attractors is contained in some trapping region , hereafter we often mention the _ basin of attraction _ of some attractor , and it is understood the basin of a given trapping region containing the attractor under consideration ."
