    "the mixing of passive scalars in the presence of turbulent motion is a subject of great theoretical and practical interest .",
    "examples of its ubiquitous applications arise in reacting flows and combustion , mixing of salt and plankton in oceans and of pollutants in the atmosphere , as well as mixing of biological substances .",
    "much experimental effort has thus been invested on mapping scalar fields in three dimensions , usually by reconstructing them from several planar cuts taken in quick succession in time ; see refs .  1 to 6 for work on turbulent liquid or air jets and refs .  7 and 8 for work on diffusion flames .",
    "the schmidt number @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the kinematic viscosity of the advecting fluid and @xmath4 is the scalar diffusivity , plays an important role in determining the nature of mixing @xcite . for the following",
    ", our focus will be on schmidt numbers larger than unity .",
    "the finest scales of the scalar are generally thought to be of the order of the batchelor scale defined as @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the kolmogorov scale given by @xmath7 ; @xmath8 is the local energy dissipation rate of turbulence , and the angular brackets indicate a suitable average . for a given flow ,",
    "the batchelor scale becomes smaller for larger @xmath9 .",
    "thus , the required resolution for large @xmath9 , common in liquid flows , is hard to attain experimentally @xcite .    with modern computers , it is possible to resolve scalar mixing in turbulence at high schmidt numbers @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that it is sometimes necessary to resolve scales that are finer than @xmath10 .",
    "such fine resolutions are desired , for instance , for obtaining reliable results on the extreme fluctuations ( both small and large ) of scalar gradients and scalar dissipation rate .",
    "we resolve scales finer than the batchelor scale by a factor of four .",
    "this fine resolution limits the ranges of @xmath9 and @xmath11 examined , where @xmath11 is the taylor microscale reynolds number .",
    "nevertheless , we can study trends with @xmath9 and @xmath11 in limited ranges of these parameters , with full three - dimensional field resolved extremely well .",
    "in particular , we consider relations between geometric and statistical properties of passive scalars and their spatial variations with respect to @xmath9 for a given turbulent flow , as well as those with the reynolds number for a given @xmath9 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",

    "conclusions and summary are presented in the final section .",
    "we solve simultaneously the navier - stokes equations for an incompressible flow @xmath12 and the advection - diffusion equation for the passive scalar field @xmath13 in box - type three - dimensional turbulence with the classical pseudo - spectral method that uses fast fourier transformations and a 2/3 de - aliasing .",

    "nevertheless , the issue is worth a brief examination as a prelude to the study of area - to - volume ratio of scalar interfaces that follows in sec .",
    "iii  b. if the surface is indeed a fractal , it is easy to write down the surface area in terms of its dimension and the cut - off scales terminating the scaling behavior @xcite",

    "2 show the log - log plots resulting from box - counting for data sets of runs 1 and 2 at @xmath43 .",
    "a constant slope with exponent @xmath58 would give the box - counting dimension of the scalar level set .",
    "however , the local slope given by @xmath62 varies continuously , as shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "though our simulations cover three orders of magnitude of scales , it is clear that no power - law scaling exists for reasons mentioned at the beginning of this section .",
    "the smallest few values of @xmath49 give a local slope of 2 , for all @xmath46 , which means that the level sets at those scales become smooth sheets .",
    "we interpret ( the slightly ) smaller slopes for intermediate scales of @xmath49 as arising from the disconnected shape of the iso - level sets . indeed",
    ", this patchiness increases with the level @xmath46 thus giving a smaller magnitude of the local slope .",
    "the conclusion from this study is that fractal behavior of the isolevel sets is not obtained in the range of @xmath11 and @xmath9 considered here .",
    "we want to emphasize , however , that this finding has no bearing on the past experimental work as reported in refs .  3 , 4 , 19 and 21 . the differences such as may exist in these experimental studies require a separate discussion which lies outside the scope of this paper .",
    "we expect that the fractal property in the inertial - convective range requires high reynolds numbers while that in the viscous - convective range requires high values of schmidt _ and _ reynolds numbers .     as a function of the isolevel @xmath46 in a log - log plot .",

    "since we do not have fractal scaling for the ranges of parameters considered here , it is necessary to compute the area of isosurfaces directly . in reacting flows",
    ", a quantity of some importance is the ratio of the isosurface area content to the volume which encloses it @xcite .",
    "this ratio is numerically calculated as follows .",
    "we first define the set @xmath66 the set is computed for each snapshot separately and the results are averaged with respect to time subsequently .",

    "3 shows the average of the area - to - volume ratio , with @xmath77 taken over several snapshots .",
    "three trends are clear : first , the ratio grows with increasing @xmath46 , which indicates a higher degree of disconnection of the isosurfaces .",
    "second , the ratio is larger for larger schmidt numbers .",
    "this is because mixing then occurs over ever finer scales whose contours are stretched and folded by the flow .",
    "finally , a larger reynolds number enables the scalar to be stirred more efficiently on all scales , yielding larger area - to - volume ratios with increasing reynolds number .",
    "we relate this geometric measure to statistical properties of the passive scalar fluctuations following ideas that were used in the slightly different context of interfacial dynamics for a turbulent jet @xcite . as is shown later ( see sec .",
    "v  b ) , the scalar fluctuations are close to the gaussian probability density function , @xmath78 , with a slight sub - gaussian behavior in the far tails .",
    "the average of the ratio @xmath77 should therefore be related to @xmath79 .",

    "we discuss results for values @xmath83 , but everything holds for @xmath84 just the same way .",
    "the additional scale @xmath85 on the left hand side of eq .",
    "( 10 ) has to appear for dimensional reasons since the right hand side is dimensionless .",
    "the scale @xmath85 is related to the surface - to - volume ratio @xmath86 , and is small when the surface - to - volume ratio is large .",
    "since @xmath86 becomes larger for  rougher \" surfaces , the scale is a characteristic measure of the transition between smooth and rough isosurfaces , perhaps describing the average connectedness and regularity of the isosurface",

    "one reason for the interest in the area of an isosurface is the flux across it .",
    "for example , in non - premixed turbulent combustion the isosurface of the stochiometric mixture fraction plays an important role and the variation of gradients across it are important for closure models @xcite .",
    "this can be calculated by integrating the flux across all infinitesimal elements of the surface .",
    "since the flux is proportional to the product of the area and the gradient of the concentration across it , it is necessary to know the gradient across each infinitesimal element of the surface .",
    "the gradient can itself be a highly fluctuating variable .",
    "the present data allow the computation of gradients and fluxes across infinitesimal elements of isosurfaces .",
    "the ( differential ) flux across an infinitesimal area element @xmath98 of an isosurface is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the outward unit normal ( see fig .  4 for @xmath83 ) .",
    "the probability density function ( pdf ) of @xmath101 is then fully determined by the pdf of scalar gradient magnitude at the isolevel @xmath80 @xmath102 thus , the quantity of interest is a conditional pdf @xmath103 which is calculated as follows . first , as in the preceding section",

    "a stretched exponential behavior is observed for a large range of the pdf , with the tails decaying more rapidly for larger @xmath46 .",
    "the pdfs suggests also that there is a considerable local variation of the flux across interfaces @xmath80 .",
    "the fluctuations increase significantly with increase in @xmath9 as well as @xmath11 .",
    "for both reynolds numbers , one can see low - probability instances whose gradients are of the order of @xmath108 .",
    "this particular gradient value is indicated in the lower right figure by the two vertical arrows .    .",

    "data for run 2 , with @xmath43 , are compared with the corresponding lognormal distribution having the same mean and standard deviation .",
    "data in each panel are plotted as a solid line and the lognormal distribution as a dotted line .",
    "the inset shows the same data in a log - linear plot that highlights the tails .",

    "7 , solid line are the original data at a resolution of @xmath40 and the dotted line is for the corresponding lognormal distribution .",
    "the analysis was repeated for the coarse - grained scalar dissipation field , and the dashed line shows the result of coarse - graining over @xmath113 cubes , giving an effective resolution of @xmath114 ; the dashed - dotted curve is for @xmath115 cubes with an effective resolution of @xmath116 . ]",
    "the scalar dissipation rate plays a central role in determining turbulent mixing . in combustion , for example , its properties enter fast chemistry models @xcite , modelling of thin reactive layers called flamelets @xcite which are embedded and advected in the turbulent flow , and conditional - moment closures for the evolution of the mixture fraction in non - premixed cases @xcite .",
    "with @xmath117 for large @xmath118 , as was seen in the last section , we expect that the tails of the pdf of @xmath119 will have stretched exponential behavior given by @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are constants .",
    "such statistics were derived analytically for scalar advection in smooth and white - in - time flows for the limit @xmath123 and @xmath124 was found @xcite . in fig .",
    "6 we show the pdf of the scalar dissipation rate in a log - lin plot for runs 1 and 2 ; sc=32 . in addition , we fit the exponential part of the formula ( [ diffflux1 ] ) to the data for the range of @xmath125 .",
    "the cases @xmath126 ( pure exponential ) and @xmath124 ( corresponding to the theory in refs .",
    "29 and 30 ) bound both sets of data from below and above , respectively , with the optimal least - square fit ( dashed line ) corresponding to @xmath111 .",
    "this form of the pdf departs clearly from log - normality .",
    "figure  7 ( upper panel ) shows the pdf of @xmath119 for run 2 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the linear scale reveals that the lognormal approximation is not particularly good near the core . the logarithmic scale ( inset )",
    "shows that the tails depart from lognormality as well : low dissipation values show a fatter tail and high dissipation values fall short of the lognormal .",
    "these departures from lognormality are robust for all reynolds and schmidt numbers considered here : this is demonstrated in the lower panel of fig .",
    "7 where we plot the data for @xmath43 at the three reynolds numbers @xmath87=10 , 24 , and 42 .",
    "there has been much discussion in the literature about the lognormality or otherwise of scalar dissipation , and we might cite an early paper sreenivasan and antonia @xcite and a recent one by su and clemens @xcite to illustrate experimental results and the discussions accompanying them . often , measured deviations from lognormality are attributed to poor measurement resolution or to low reynolds numbers or to noise in the experimental system .    in order to shed some light on how the pdfs depend on probe resolution in an experiment , we plot in fig .",
    "8 the pdfs that result when the statistics are taken over successively coarse - grained scalar dissipation fields . the coarse - graining scale does not produce a qualitatively different result on the right side of the distribution ( @xmath127 ) , for which the pdf remains sub - gaussian for all cases . for negative @xmath128 , there is probably a particular coarse - graining that may collapse the data on to the lognormal curve , but this coincidence would be accidental at best . on the effect of reynolds number , we can only comment that the behavior is similar for both reynolds numbers considered here .",
    "the double - precision calculations throughout this work keep the noise effects under control .",
    "we thus conclude that , while the pdf is roughly lognormal , the deviations from it are considerable .      in fig .",
    "9 we show the joint pdf @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the probability of having the scalar dissipation rate between @xmath119 and @xmath131 _ and _ the scalar fluctuation between @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "the figure shows the joint pdf for two reynolds numbers and @xmath42 . the upper row of fig .",
    "9 shows iso - contours of @xmath129 which are equidistant in units of the logarithm to base 10 . the joint pdf is wider with respect to the @xmath132-axis for the case of larger reynolds number",
    "this is due to the fact that the scalar field and the dissipation field acquire larger amplitudes with increasing @xmath87 .",
    "the lower panels show the scalar pdf calculated by integrating @xmath129 over @xmath119 .",
    "we observe an almost gaussian shape of @xmath134 for both reynolds numbers ( as anticipated in sec .",
    "additionally , we have compared our results with the limiting shape for a scalar field pdf that was analytically predicted for advection in a random flow @xcite .",
    "the comparison is good only for small amplitudes of @xmath132 .",
    "a nearly gaussian pdf for the scalar fluctuations is in agreement with a number of other studies at @xmath135 , such as heated grid turbulence @xcite , isotropic turbulence with a mean scalar gradient @xcite , a homogeneous shear flow with heating by a constant mean temperature gradient @xcite . in our simulations ,",
    "the fluctuations extend to approximately @xmath136 and the deviations in the tails are slightly sub - gaussian .",
    "exponential tails of the pdf , as found by jayesh and warhaft @xcite , were not observed for our range of parameters . it should be mentioned that they were also predicted analytically for a white - in - time smooth gaussian flow by shraiman and siggia @xcite .",
    "furthermore , exponential tails have been suggested to result from an aggregation process of elementary local straining motion events , and close - to - exponential tails have been observed in jets sufficiently far away from the nozzle exit @xcite .",
    "overholt and pope @xcite argued that the nearly gaussian or slightly sub - gaussian statistics may result from the limited size of the simulation box in relation to the integral scale .",
    "the ratio of our box size to the integral scale of the flow , @xmath137 , is about 6 to 8 ( see table 1 ) ; in terms of the integral scale of the passive scalar at the largest schmidt number , the ratio @xmath138 varies from 13 to 21 .",
    "this is significantly larger than the corresponding scale ratios in the experiment of jayesh and warhaft .",
    "the available evidence thus suggests that the relative size of the box size to the integral scale is not responsible for the shape of the pdf .",
    "a plausible argument can be made that the ratio @xmath139 might be a more appropriate quantity .",

    "though with low probability , gradients of the order of magnitude @xmath108 do occur in the scalar field .",
    "this clearly suggests the existence of sharp fronts accompanied by large jumps in the scalar concentration .",
    "the scalar dissipation rate departs from lognormality more than previous measurements suggest .",
    "the reasons for close correspondence in previous data are not entirely clear , but it must be pointed out that very few data sets exist in which all three scalar gradient components that enter the scalar dissipation rate definition ( see ( eq .  [ scalardiss ] ) ) were measured with adequate resolution and without the use of taylor s hypothesis . to consider if the closeness to lognormality observed previously was caused by poor resolution in measurements , we coarse - grained the data and replotted them",
    ". the coarse - grained data also display significant departures from lognormality .",
    "we thus conclude that the reasons for observed departures are more complex ; they may also emphasize the lack of strict universality in the dissipation statistics .",
    "the high spectral resolution in the present dns allowed the evaluation of a conditional moment analysis as well .",
    "we have been able to confirm theoretical predictions that follow from nearly gaussian fluctuations of the passive scalar field for @xmath155 , say .    in summary",
    ", we have quantified various properties of the scalar isosurfaces for conditions that are typical of many laboratory experiments in reacting flows . beside the connections between statistical and geometrical properties of scalars studied here , it is interesting to shed more light on the formation of characteristic scalar structures with respect to time , and to relate them to the underlying local flow properties for different reynolds numbers .",
    "this can be a useful way of incorporating reynolds number effects on mixing in the batchelor regime and is part of the future work .",
