    "the investigation of the meson properties in the framework of constituent quark models is an important problem of the elementary particle physics . at present",
    "a large amount of experimental data on the masses of ground and excited states of heavy and light mesons has been accumulated @xcite . by comparing theoretical predictions with experimental data , one can obtain a valuable information on the form of the quark - antiquark interaction potential .",
    "such information is of great practical interest since at present it is not possible to obtain the @xmath1 potential in the whole range of distances from the basic principles of qcd .",
    "as it is well known , the growing of the strong coupling constant with distance makes perturbation theory inapplicable at large distances ( in the infrared region ) . in this region",
    "it is necessary to account for nonperturbative effects connected with the complicated structure of the qcd vacuum .",
    "all this leads to a theoretical uncertainty in the @xmath1 potential at large and intermediate distances .",
    "it is just in this region of large and intermediate distances that most of the basic meson characteristics are formed .",
    "this makes it possible to investigate the low - energy region of strong interaction by studying the mass spectra and decays of mesons .",
    "some recent investigations @xcite have shown that there could be also a linear ( in radius ) correction to the perturbative coulomb potential at small distances ( in contradiction with ope predictions ) .",
    "the estimates of the slope yield that it could be of the same order of magnitude as the slope of the long - range confining linear potential .",
    "it means then that the widely used cornell potential ( the sum of the coulomb and linear confining terms ) is really a correct one in the static limit both at large and at small distances .",
    "the relativistic properties of the quark - antiquark interaction potential play an important role in analysing different static and dynamical characteristics of heavy mesons .",
    "the lorentz - structure of the confining quark - antiquark interaction is of particular interest . in the literature",
    "there is no consent on this item . for a long time",
    "the scalar confining kernel has been considered to be the most appropriate one @xcite .",
    "the main argument in favour of this choice is based on the nature of the heavy quark spin - orbit potential .",
    "the scalar potential gives a vanishing long - range magnetic contribution , which is in agreement with the flux tube picture of quark confinement of  @xcite , and allows to get the fine structure for heavy quarkonia in accord with experimental data .",
    "however , the calculations of electroweak decay rates of heavy mesons with a scalar confining potential alone yield results which are in worse agreement with data than for a vector potential @xcite .",
    "the radiative @xmath2-transitions in quarkonia such as e.  g. @xmath3 are the most sensitive to the lorentz - structure of the confining potential .",
    "the relativistic corrections for these decays arising from vector and scalar potentials have different signs @xcite .",
    "in particular , as it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , agreement with experiments for these decays can be achieved only for a mixture of vector and scalar potentials . in this context , it is worth remarking , that the recent study of the @xmath1 interaction in the wilson loop approach @xcite indicates that it can not be considered as simply a scalar .",
    "moreover , the found structure of spin - independent relativistic corrections is not compatible with a scalar potential .",
    "a similar conclusion has been obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of a foldy - wouthuysen reduction of the full coulomb gauge hamiltonian of qcd . there",
    ", the lorentz - structure of the confinement has been found to be of vector nature .",
    "the scalar character of spin splittings in heavy quarkonia in this approach is dynamically generated through the interaction with collective gluonic degrees of freedom .",
    "thus we see that while the spin - dependent structure of ( @xmath1 ) interaction is well established now , the spin - independent part is still controversial in the literature .",
    "the uncertainty in the lorentz - structure of the confining interaction complicates the account for retardation corrections since the relativistic reconstruction of the static confining potential is not unique . in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we gave some possible prescription of such reconstruction which , in particular , provides the fulfilment of the barchielli , brambilla , prosperi ( bbp ) relations @xcite following from the lorentz invariance of the wilson loop . here",
    "we generalize this prescription and discuss its connection with the known quark potentials and the implications for the heavy quarkonium mass spectra .",
    "the other important point is the inclusion of radiative corrections in the perturbative part of the quark potential .",
    "there have been considerable progress in recent years and now the perturbative qcd corrections to the static potential are known up to two loops @xcite though for the velocity dependent and spin - dependent potentials only one - loop corrections are calculated @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we describe our relativistic quark model . the approach to accounting for retardation effects in the @xmath1 potential in the general case",
    "is presented in sec .",
    "the resulting heavy quark potential containing both spin - independent and spin - dependent parts with the account of one - loop radiative corrections is given in sec .",
    "we use this potential for the calculations of the heavy quarkonium mass spectra in sec .",
    "v. section  vi contains our conclusions and discussion of the results .",
    "in the quasipotential approach a meson is described by the wave function of the bound quark - antiquark state , which satisfies the quasipotential equation @xcite of the schrdinger type @xcite @xmath4 where the relativistic reduced mass is @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are given by @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the meson mass , @xmath10 are the masses of light and heavy quarks , and @xmath11 is their relative momentum . in the centre of mass system",

    "it is constructed with the help of the off - mass - shell scattering amplitude , projected onto the positive energy states .",
    "constructing the quasipotential of the quark - antiquark interaction we have assumed that the effective interaction is the sum of the usual one - gluon exchange term with the mixture of long - range vector and scalar linear confining potentials , where the vector confining potential contains the pauli interaction .",
    "the quasipotential is then defined by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the qcd coupling constant , @xmath16 is the gluon propagator in the coulomb gauge @xmath17 and @xmath18 ; @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the dirac matrices and spinors @xmath21 with @xmath22 .",
    "the effective long - range vector vertex is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the pauli interaction constant characterizing the anomalous chromomagnetic moment of quarks .",
    "vector and scalar confining potentials in the nonrelativistic limit reduce to @xmath25 reproducing @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the mixing coefficient .",
    "the expression for the quasipotential for the heavy quarkonia , expanded in @xmath0 without retardation corrections to the confining potential , can be found in ref .",
    "the structure of the spin - dependent interaction is in agreement with the parameterization of eichten and feinberg @xcite .",
    "all the parameters of our model like quark masses , parameters of the linear confining potential @xmath28 and @xmath29 , mixing coefficient @xmath27 and anomalous chromomagnetic quark moment @xmath24 are fixed from the analysis of heavy quarkonium masses ( see below sec .",
    "v ) and radiative decays .",
    "the quark masses @xmath30 gev , @xmath31 gev and the parameters of the linear potential @xmath32 gev@xmath33 and @xmath34 gev have usual values of quark models .",
    "the value of the mixing coefficient of vector and scalar confining potentials @xmath35 has been determined from the consideration of the heavy quark expansion for the semileptonic @xmath36 decays @xcite and charmonium radiative decays @xcite .",
    "finally , the universal pauli interaction constant @xmath37 has been fixed from the analysis of the fine splitting of heavy quarkonia @xmath38- states @xcite .",
    "note that the long - range magnetic contribution to the potential in our model is proportional to @xmath39 and thus vanishes for the chosen value of @xmath37 . in the present paper",
    "we will include into consideration the retardation corrections as well as one - loop radiative corrections .",
    "for the one - gluon exchange part of the @xmath1 potential it is quite easy to isolate the retardation contribution . indeed due to the vector current conservation ( gauge invariance )",

    "we obtain the well - known breit hamiltonian ( the same as in qed @xcite ) if we further expand eq .",
    "( [ k0 ] ) in @xmath42 @xmath49 this treatment allows also for the correct dirac limit in which the retardation contribution vanishes when one of the particles becomes infinitely heavy @xcite .    for the confining part of the @xmath1 potential",
    "the retardation contribution is much more indefinite .",
    "it is a consequence of our poor knowledge of the confining potential especially in what concerns its relativistic properties : the lorentz structure ( scalar , vector , etc . ) and the dependence on the covariant variables such as @xmath50 .",
    "nevertheless we can perform some general considerations and then apply them to a particular case of the linearly rising potential . to this end",

    "we see that the calculated masses agree with experimental values within few mev and this difference is compatible with the estimates of the higher order corrections in @xmath0 and @xmath135 .",
    "the model reproduces correctly both the positions of the centres of gravity of the levels and their fine and hyperfine splitting .",
    "note that the good agreement of the calculated mass spectra with experimental data is achieved by systematic accounting for all relativistic corrections ( including retardation corrections ) of order @xmath0 , both spin - dependent and spin - independent ones , while in most of potential models only the spin - dependent corrections are included .",
    "the calculated mass spectra of charmonium and bottomonium are close to the results of our previous calculation @xcite where retardation effects in the confining potential and radiative corrections to the one - gluon exchange potential were not taken into account .",
    "both calculations give close values for the experimentally measured states as well as for the yet unobserved ones .",
    "the inclusion of radiative corrections allowed to get better results for the fine splittings of quarkonium states .",
    "thus we can conclude from this comparison that the inclusion of retardation effects and spin - independent one - loop radiative corrections resulted only in the slight shift ( @xmath136)in the value of the qcd parameter @xmath129 and an approximately two - fold decrease of the constant @xmath29 .",
    "is included only in the vector part ( [ vlin ] ) .",
    "] such changes of parameters almost do not influence the wave functions . as a result",
    "the decay matrix elements involving heavy quarkonium states remain mostly unchanged .",
    "we plot the reduced radial wave functions @xmath137 for charmonium and bottomonium in figs .",
    "[ cm ] and [ bt ] .",
    "in this paper we have considered the heavy quarkonium spectroscopy in the framework of the relativistic quark model .",
    "both relativistic corrections of order @xmath0 and one - loop radiative corrections to the short - range potential have been included into the calculation .",
    "special attention has been devoted to the role and the structure of retardation corrections to the confining interaction .",
    "our general analysis of the retardation effects has shown that we have a good theoretical motivation to fix the form of retardation contributions to the vector potential in the form ( [ vpr ] ) which corresponds to the parameter @xmath83 in the generalized expression ( [ cret ] ) .",
    "on the contrary , the structure of the retardation contribution to the scalar potential is less restricted from general analysis .",
    "this means that it is not possible to fix the value of @xmath82 in ( [ cret ] ) on general grounds .",
    "our numerical analysis has shown that the value of @xmath138 is preferable .",
    "thus for the energy transfer squared we have the symmetrized product ( [ k0s ] ) for the vector potential and a half sum ( [ k0hs ] ) for the scalar potential , in agreement with lattice calculations @xcite and minimal area law and flux tube models @xcite .",
    "the found structure of the spin - independent interaction ( [ sipot ] ) with the account of retardation contributions satisfies the bbp @xcite relations ( [ re ] ) , which follow from the lorentz invariance of the wilson loop .    in our calculations we have used the heavy quark - antiquark interaction potential with the complete account of all relativistic corrections of order @xmath0 and one - loop radiative corrections both for the spin - independent and spin - dependent parts .",
    "the inclusion of these corrections allowed to fit correctly the position of the centres of gravity of the heavy quarkonium levels as well as their fine and hyperfine splittings . moreover , the account for radiative corrections results in a better description of level splittings .",
    "the values of the main parameters of our quark model such as the slope of the confining linear potential @xmath32 gev@xmath33 , the mixing coefficient @xmath35 of scalar and vector confining potentials and the long - range anomalous chromomagnetic quark moment @xmath37 used in the present analysis are kept the same as they were fixed from the previous consideration of radiative decays @xcite and the heavy quark expansion @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath35 implies that the confining quark - antiquark potential in heavy mesons has predominantly a lorentz - vector structure , while the scalar potential is anticonfining and helps to reproduce the initial nonrelativistic potential . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath37 supports the conjecture that the long - range confining forces are dominated by chromoelectric interaction and that the chromomagnetic interaction vanishes , which is in accord with the dual superconductivity picture @xcite and flux tube model @xcite .",
    "the presented results for the charmonium and bottomonium mass spectra agree well with the available experimental data .",
    "it is of great interest to consider the predictions for the masses of the @xmath139 and @xmath140 levels of bottomonium , which have not yet been observed experimentally .",
    "the difficulty of their experimental observation is that these states ( except @xmath141 ) can not be produced in @xmath142 collisions , since their quantum numbers are not the same as the quantum numbers of the photon .",
    "therefore , in search for these states one must investigate decay processes of vector ( @xmath143 ) levels .",
    "we discussed the possibility of observation of these states in radiative decays in ref .",
    "note that the small value predicted for the hyperfine splitting @xmath144  mev leads to difficulties in observation of the @xmath145 state .",
    "recently it was argued @xcite that the account of relativistic kinematics substantially modifies the description of the charmonium fine structure and , in particular , leads to considerably larger values of the @xmath146 splittings than in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "both our previous calculation @xcite and the present one confirm this observation .",
    "our prediction for the charmonium @xmath147 mass lies close to the prediction of ref .",
    "@xcite and slightly lower than the @xmath148 threshold .",
    "however , the fact that this state is above @xmath149 and close to @xmath148 thresholds makes threshold effects very important and can considerably influence the quark model prediction .",
