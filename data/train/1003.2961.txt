    "the existence of cosmic - ray particles of energies above @xmath2  ev , first established in the early 1960 s , has become a problem of the first rank in particle astrophysics .",
    "models for their production must generate particle energies many orders of magnitude higher than achievable on earth , and these models in turn require extreme source physics that has not yet been formulated in a self - consistent manner . even more problematic , the propagation of such particles is limited by strong energy loss due to the greisen - zatsepin - kuzmin ( gzk ) process  @xcite .",
    "hadrons are produced via the delta - photoproduction resonance by interactions with cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons .",
    "this gzk cutoff in energy limits the propagation distance of the ultra - high energy cosmic rays ( uhecrs ) to within 100 - 200  mpc in the current epoch , and severely distorts the observed energy spectrum .",
    "astronomy using charged - particle uhecrs is thus limited to the local universe , suffering from both the loss of source spectral information , and the difficulty in back - tracing uhecrs through intergalactic magnetic fields .    at distances of several gpc",
    ", corresponding to the star - formation maximum at redshift @xmath3 , the higher energy and density of the cmb photons leads to even greater restrictions on cosmic - ray propagation , and a more rapid energy loss to delta photoproduction .",
    "however , information about the source particles does survive in the form of secondary neutrinos in the decay chain , known as the ultra - high energy ( uhe ) cosmogenic neutrinos , first described by berezinsky & zatsepin ( bz )  @xcite .",
    "their momenta are unaffected by magnetic fields , and they propagate without energy loss directly to earth , retaining information about the cosmic distribution of uhecrs and their sources .",
    "the anita long duration balloon experiment was designed to search for cosmogenic neutrinos via electromagnetic cascades initiated by the neutrinos in antarctic ice , the most massive body of accessible , solid , radio - transparent dielectric material on earth .",
    "we previously placed limits on the uhe cosmic neutrino flux from the first flight of anita  @xcite , and provided a separate detailed description  @xcite of the anita instrument , flight system , data acquisition , and analysis methods . in this article",
    "we detail upgrades and augmentations beyond the instrument and methodology previously reported .",
    "the second flight of anita ( anita - ii ) launched from williams field , antarctica on december 21 , 2008 and landed near siple dome after 31 days aloft , resulting in 28.5 live days .",
    "[ payload08 ] shows an image of the payload on ascent after it had deployed to its full flight configuration , and an inset of the balloon and payload at float altitude . the mean ice depth in the field - of - view was 1.4  km , approximately one attenuation length at sub - ghz radio frequencies  @xcite .",
    "anita - ii flew at an altitude of 35 - 37  km above sea level ( 33 - 35  km above the ice surface ) , and was thus able to synoptically view a volume of @xmath4 m  @xmath5 of ice .",
    "anita - ii s sensitivity to cosmogenic neutrinos was improved substantially compared to anita - i : the front - end system noise temperature was reduced by 40  k , a 20% improvement in temperature  @xcite ; 8 additional quad - ridged horn antennas were added to the previous total of 32 ; and the efficiency of the hardware trigger was optimized for impulsive signals . also , the instrument was made much more robust to the effects of bursts of anthropogenic radio - frequency ( rf ) interference with the ability to mask channels from the trigger in the azimuthal sectors of the payload pointing at the noise source .",
    "masking occurred on time scales of a minute .",
    "this upgrade significantly improved the livetime when in view of strong sources such as mcmurdo and amundsen - scott stations , and trigger thresholds remained at thermal - noise levels throughout the flight .",
    "the combined effect of all of these modifications led to an increase of about a factor of four improvement in the expected signal from typical cosmogenic neutrino models as compared to anita - i .",
    "8 meters , and each antenna face is 0.95  m across .",
    "the inset shows the balloon and payload viewed telescopically at float altitude of 35  km.,width=273 ]    the anita - ii hardware trigger selects impulsive radio signals with broadband frequency content and temporal coherence over nanosecond timescales in the vertical polarization .",
    "the broadband nature of triggered signals was achieved by requiring power in multiple frequency bands , and temporal coherence was ensured by requiring impulsive power in a full - band channel .",
    "all simulations and laboratory measurements of askaryan signals  @xcite from ice sheet neutrino interactions show that the rf signal at the payload is predominantly vertically polarized , due to the surface fresnel coefficient and cherenkov geometry  @xcite .",
    "no strict pulse shape requirements are enforced in the trigger to allow for variations in the shape of any individual neutrino - induced cascade , and the trigger is thus very inclusive .",
    "the trigger threshold rides at the ambient thermal noise level to maintain an approximately constant trigger rate of @xmath610  hz , which is dominated  ( 98.5% ) by incoherent thermal noise fluctuations .",
    "these thermal - noise triggers have well - modeled statistical probabilities for producing random impulses , and are highly suppressed in analysis with requirements of spatial and temporal coherence .",
    "most other triggers are from anthropogenic sources .",
    "such signals can mimic neutrino - like impulses , and may arise from high - voltage discharges in electrical equipment or from metallic structures charged by blowing snow or related effects . to remove such backgrounds , we identify active and prior human activity in antarctica and optimize pointing resolution to reliably associate anthropogenic signals with known sources .",
    "we know of no expected particle - physics backgrounds .",
    "extensive calibration and validation of the system response and trigger efficiency for a range of impulse signal - to - noise ratios ( snrs ) was done both prior to flight and with ground - to - payload impulse generating antennas during flight .",
    "these in - flight pulser systems were located at the launch site and at a remote field station at taylor dome on the edge of the antarctic plateau .",
    "in both cases , impulse generators were fed through an antenna immersed in the ice as deep as 90  m  @xcite . in -",
    "flight measurements of the impulses from taylor dome provided validation that refraction effects on signal propagation through the ice surface do not significantly affect the coherence of the received signal , to distances of 400  km .",
    "measurements of trigger efficiency in - flight were consistent with expectations from the ground calibrations , considering the narrower frequency content of impulses from taylor dome .",
    "ground - to - payload signals provided an equally critical function in detector alignment and in determining the precision of directional reconstruction .",
    "anita s antenna signals are combined via pulse - phase interferometric methods  @xcite , resulting in a radio map ( `` interferometric image '' ) for each polarization of the intensity as a function of payload elevation and azimuth .",
    "the largest peak in either map determines the direction of the signal source .",
    "the payload coordinate frame is tied to the geodetic frame via onboard gps and sun - sensor measurements to a precision of about 0.1@xmath7 .",
    "the pointing resolution in our analysis is @xmath8 in elevation and @xmath9 in azimuth , depending on the snr of the event .",
    "our signal region comprises events that do not come from known sources of human activity ( `` camps '' ) and have no geospatial partner event within distance and angular separation criteria .",
    "we blinded the signal region in two ways simultaneously .",
    "first , we inserted an undisclosed number ( 12 ) of neutrino - like calibration events at random , concealed times throughout the flight .",
    "second , we blinded ourselves to events in the signal region _",
    "i.e. _ events that have no spatial partner . the analysis efficiency and background",
    "are estimated before opening this hidden signal box .",
    "prior to unblinding , the complete set of in - flight calibration pulser data is used to optimize the pointing reconstruction of the analysis . in this section ,",
    "we describe the sequence of analysis cuts that we applied to the sample until the final step , opening the blind signal box .",
    "table  [ event - table ] shows the the total event sample , the sequential number of surviving events as each analysis cut is applied , and the efficiency of each cut .",
    "the number of * hardware - triggered events * is the total number of events recorded .",
    "* quality events * exclude on- and off - payload calibration pulser events , unbiased auto - trigger events , and a small fraction ( @xmath61% ) of events with data corruption .",
