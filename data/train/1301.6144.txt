    "let @xmath1 be a complex separable infinite - dimensional hilbert space , and @xmath8 a bounded linear operator on @xmath1 .",
    "our present work is motivated by the well - known invariant subspace and subset problems , which can be easily stated as follows : if @xmath8 , does there always exist a closed subspace @xmath9 of @xmath1 ( resp . a closed subset @xmath10 of @xmath1 ) , non - trivial in the sense that it is distinct from @xmath11 and @xmath1 , and which is invariant under the action of @xmath0 ?",
    "it is not difficult to see that an operator  @xmath0 on @xmath1 has no non - trivial invariant closed subspace ( resp .",
    "subset ) if and only if for every non - zero vector @xmath3 the linear span of the orbit @xmath12 of @xmath5 under the action of @xmath0 ( resp .",
    "the orbit @xmath13 itself ) is dense in @xmath1 .",
    "the invariant subset problem can thus be reformulated as follows : does there exist a minimal action of the semi - group @xmath14 on the hilbert space @xmath1 ?",
    "of course the invariant subspace and subset problems make sense on general separable banach spaces as well , and in this setting both problems admit a negative answer .",
    "enflo @xcite and read @xcite constructed examples of infinite - dimensional ,  banach spaces @xmath15 and of bounded operators @xmath0 on @xmath15 without non - trivial invariant closed subspaces . read then refined his constructions in several papers such as @xcite , where he gave an example of an operator on @xmath16 without non - trivial invariant closed subspaces , @xcite which exhibited an example of an operator on @xmath16 without non - trivial invariant closed subsets , and @xcite which gives examples of operators without non - trivial invariant subspaces on @xmath17 or on the @xmath18-direct sum of countably many copies of the james space @xmath19 .",
    "all these counterexamples are constructed on non - reflexive spaces .",
    "both the invariant subspace and subset problems remain open on reflexive spaces , and on the hilbert space in particular .",
    "we refer the reader to the survey @xcite , the book @xcite or to the recent book @xcite for more information .",
    "these references are mainly concerned with results in the positive direction , i.e. conditions under which an operator does admit a non - trivial invariant subspace ( or subset ) .    at present , operators on the hilbert space which seem `` closest '' to having no non - trivial invariant closed subset are the ones constructed in the paper @xcite .",
    "we call such operators _ read s type operators _ because they are constructed by adapting part of the techniques employed by read in his various constructions to the hilbert space setting . in order to state the properties of these operators which will be needed in this paper ,",
    "let us recall that a vector @xmath5 of @xmath1 is called _ hypercyclic _ for an operator  @xmath0 if the orbit @xmath13 is dense in @xmath1 .",
    "we denote by @xmath20 the set of such vectors .",
    "then @xmath0 has no non - trivial invariant closed subset if and only if @xmath21 .",
    "the operators constructed in @xcite have the property that @xmath22 is `` small '' , in the sense that it is contained in a countable union of closed hyperplanes of @xmath1 .",
    "our main result in this paper is the following :    [ th1 ] there exists a bounded linear operator @xmath0 acting on a complex separable infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath1 , and a unitary operator @xmath4 on @xmath1 , such that the following property holds true : for every non - zero vector @xmath5 of @xmath23 , either @xmath5 or @xmath6 has a dense orbit under the action of @xmath0 .",
    "in other words , @xmath24 . in particular , @xmath25 is dense in @xmath1 for every non - zero vector @xmath3 .",
    "this theorem has the following interesting consequence : denote by @xmath7 the free semi - group with two generators .",
    "it can be seen as the set of all finite sequences @xmath26 , @xmath27 , of zeroes and ones , where the group operation is given by concatenation : @xmath28",
    "if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two bounded linear operators on @xmath1 , one can define an action @xmath31 of @xmath7 on @xmath1 in the following way : @xmath32&h\\hphantom{aaaaaaaa}\\\\ \\bigl ( ( \\omega _ { 0},\\dots,\\omega _ { n}),x\\bigr)\\ar@{|->}[r]&t_{\\omega _ { 0}}\\dots t_{\\omega _ { n}}x.}\\ ] ] with the notation above , @xmath33 .",
    "such an action is called _ minimal _ if the orbit of every non - zero vector @xmath5 of @xmath23 , that is the set @xmath34 , is dense in @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath0 and @xmath4 are the operators given by theorem [ th1 ] above , define two operators @xmath29 and @xmath30 on @xmath1 by setting @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath31 be the associated action of @xmath7 on @xmath1 .",
    "for every @xmath37 , the orbit @xmath34 contains the sets @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "since one of these two sets is dense in @xmath1 , we obtain in particular that @xmath31 is minimal .",
    "[ cor2 ] there exists a minimal action of the free semi - group with two generators @xmath7 on a complex separable infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "the operator @xmath0 of theorem [ th1 ] is a read s type operator .",
    "such operators are non - invertible , and this seems to be inherent to the construction .",
    "so it is not clear whether it is possible to construct a minimal action of the free group @xmath40 on a hilbert space .",
    "but if we replace the operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 above by operators of the form @xmath41 and @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is so large that @xmath44 is invertible , then for every non - zero vector @xmath3 the linear span of one of the two sets @xmath45 and @xmath46 is dense in @xmath1 .",
    "so we obtain in the same way an action @xmath31 of @xmath40 on @xmath1 such that for every non - zero vector @xmath5 of @xmath23 , the linear span of the orbit @xmath47 of @xmath5 under the action of @xmath40 by @xmath31 is dense in @xmath1 .",
    "minimal affine isometric actions of groups on an infinite - dimensional hilbert space are studied in the paper @xcite , and it is proved here in particular that there exists a minimal isometric action of the free groupe with three generators @xmath48 on an infinite - dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th1 ] uses some fine properties of the operators constructed in @xcite . after recalling these briefly in section [ sec2 ]",
    "we show , using a slightly modified version of the lomonosov inequality of @xcite , that these read s type operators on the hilbert space do have non - trivial invariant closed subspaces , and we give a rather precise description of their set of non - hypercyclic vectors .",
    "we prove theorem [ th1 ] in section [ sec3 ] , using this description as well as a construction of specific increasing sequences of subspaces in the vector - valued @xmath49-space @xmath50 .",
    "we also observe there that theorem [ th1 ] yields an example of a pair of two unitarily equivalent operators on @xmath1 which generate @xmath51 in the strong ( or weak ) topology .",
    "the main properties of the operators  constructed in @xcite which will be of interest to us here are summarized in the following theorem :    [ th3 ] let @xmath1 be a separable infinite - dimensional hilbert space . there",
    "exist bounded operators  @xmath0 on @xmath1 having the following three properties :    1 .",
    "for every vector @xmath3 , the closure of the orbit @xmath13 of @xmath5 under the action of @xmath0 is a subspace . in other words ,",
    "the closures of @xmath52 and @xmath53 coincide ; 2 .",
    "the family @xmath54 of all the closures of the orbits of @xmath0 is totally ordered by inclusion : for every pair @xmath55 of vectors of @xmath1 , either @xmath56 or @xmath57 ; 3 .",
    "the operator  @xmath58 induced by @xmath0 on any of its invariant subspaces @xmath9 is hypercyclic , i.e.  there exists a vector @xmath59 such that @xmath60 .",
    "property ( p ) is an easy consequence of properties ( p1 ) and ( p2 ) ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5.1 ) ) , but we state it explicitly here as it will be needed in the sequel . another observation which will be important is the following : if @xmath61 denotes an orthonormal basis of @xmath1 , the operators  @xmath0 of @xcite which are constructed starting from this basis have the form @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is a forward weighted shift with respect to the basis @xmath61 and @xmath64 is a nuclear operator : @xmath65 where @xmath66 for all @xmath67 and @xmath68 is either @xmath69 or very close to @xmath70 as @xmath67 tends to infinity , and @xmath71 can be made as small as we wish .",
    "this kind of property is common to all read s type operators : in the definition of the vectors @xmath72 for @xmath73 , the set of all nonnegative integers @xmath67 is partitioned into two types of intervals , lay - off intervals and working intervals .",
    "working intervals are separated by very long lay - off intervals .",
    "when @xmath67 is not the right endpoint of either a working interval or a lay - off interval , @xmath72 is defined as @xmath74 , where the weight @xmath68 is chosen extremely close to @xmath70 when @xmath67 gets very large .",
    "this gives the shift part @xmath63 of the operator  @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath0 is a right endpoint of a lay - off or a working interval , @xmath75 is extremely small and can be chosen to decrease very quickly as @xmath67 grows .",
    "this gives the nuclear part @xmath64 of the operator , and @xmath62 .",
    "a consequence of this observation is that such operators  @xmath0 do have non - trivial invariant subspaces , although , as will be recalled shortly afterwards , their sets of non - hypercyclic  vectors are very small .",
    "[ prop4 ] if @xmath0 is one of the operators of @xcite acting on a complex separable infinite - dimensional hilbert space @xmath1 , @xmath22 is a dense linear subspace of @xmath1 , and @xmath0 has non - trivial invariant closed subspaces .",
    "the proof of proposition [ prop4 ] relies on a refinement of the lomonosov inequality proven in @xcite .",
    "this inequality motivates the well - known lomonosov conjecture that any adjoint operator  acting on a complex dual separable banach space @xmath76 has a non - trivial invariant closed subspace .",
    "it is stated as follows :    let @xmath15 be a complex separable banach space , and let @xmath77 be a weakly closed sub - algebra of @xmath78 with @xmath79 .",
    "then there exist two non - zero vectors @xmath80 and @xmath81 such that for every @xmath82 , @xmath83 where @xmath84 denotes the essential norm of @xmath85 , i.e.  the distance of @xmath85 to the space of compact operators on @xmath15 .",
    "here is the slightly stronger statement which will be needed in the present paper .",
    "it is completely contained in the proof of ( * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath70 ) , and so we will only say a few words about it .",
    "[ th0 ] let @xmath15 be a complex separable banach space , and let @xmath77 be a uniformly closed subalgebra of @xmath78 .",
    "let @xmath86 be a closed ball of @xmath76 of positive radius , which does not contain the point @xmath69 .",
    "then we have the following alternative : either    ( a1 ) there exist a positive constant @xmath87 depending only on @xmath86 , a vector @xmath88 and a non - zero  vector @xmath89 such that @xmath90 is dense in @xmath76 for every vector @xmath88 , and in this case there exists an operator  @xmath91 on @xmath15 belonging to @xmath77 , distinct from the identity operator , and such that @xmath92 for some vector @xmath93 in @xmath86 .",
    "the proof of lemma @xmath94 of @xcite gives the following : if @xmath95 is such that @xmath96 , and if @xmath86 denotes the ball of radius @xmath97 centered at @xmath98 , then either there exist a vector @xmath88 and a non - zero  element @xmath99 of @xmath100 such that @xmath101 is dense in @xmath76 for every vector @xmath88 , and in this case there exists an element @xmath102 of @xmath77 such that @xmath92 for some vector @xmath93 in @xmath86 , and @xmath70 is an eigenvalue of @xmath91 of finite multiplicity which is an isolated point in the spectrum of @xmath91 .",
    "hence ( a2 ) is satified when @xmath86 is the closed ball centered at @xmath98 of radius @xmath97    exactly the same proof shows that if @xmath95 is non - zero  and @xmath86 is the ball of radius @xmath103 centered at @xmath98 , with @xmath104 , then either there exist a vector @xmath88 and a non - zero  element @xmath99 of @xmath100 such that @xmath105 .",
    "let us now mention an important consequence of theorem [ th0 ] , which is a slight generalization of a result of @xcite :    [ cor ] suppose that @xmath0 is a bounded operator  on a complex separable hilbert space which is a compact perturbation of a power - bounded operator  on @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath0 has a dense set of non - hypercyclic  vectors .    by our assumption the operator  @xmath0",
    "can be decomposed as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 and @xmath64 a compact operator on @xmath1 .",

    "then for every closed ball @xmath86 of @xmath1 with non - empty interior not containing @xmath69 , either ( a1 ) or ( a2 ) of theorem [ th0 ] above is satisfied .",
    "but it is not difficult to see that ( a2 ) can never hold here .",
    "suppose indeed that ( a2 ) is true : then there exist an operator  @xmath112 , not equal to the identity , and a vector @xmath113 such that @xmath114 .",
    "since the algebra @xmath77 is commutative , the equality @xmath115 holds true for every @xmath82 . but",
    "@xmath116 belongs to @xmath86 , so the set @xmath117 is dense in @xmath1 by ( a2 ) .",
    "hence @xmath118 , which is a contradiction .",
    "so ( a2 ) can not be true , and ( a1 ) is satisfied : for every non - empty open ball @xmath86 of @xmath1 not containing @xmath69 , there exist a positive constant @xmath87 and two non - zero  vectors @xmath119 with @xmath120 such that @xmath121 .",

    "it remains to prove that it is dense in @xmath1 .",
    "we have seen that @xmath0 can be decomposed as @xmath62 , where the weights @xmath68 of the shift are either @xmath69 or tend to @xmath70 very quickly as @xmath67 tends to infinity and @xmath64 is compact .",
    "let @xmath128 be the weighted shift on @xmath1 defined by @xmath129 if @xmath130 and @xmath131 if @xmath132 .",

    "there are of course much simpler examples of pairs @xmath273 of operators on @xmath1 which generate @xmath51 : as was pointed out to us by lyudmila turowska , it suffices to take for @xmath63 the forward shift with respect to an orthonormal basis @xmath61 of @xmath1 , and for @xmath274 the backward shift with respect to this same basis .",
