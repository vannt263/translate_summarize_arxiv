    "the history of galaxies is , in large part , the history of star formation .",
    "massive stars play key roles both as highly visible tracers of star formation and as players in altering surrounding star formation and both energy and chemistry of the interstellar medium .",
    "it is these stars which dominate the observed properties of actively star - forming galaxies .",
    "the massive part of stellar populations is most clearly observed in the ultraviolet , where their energy distributions peak and competing light from cooler stars is minimal , as long as the foreground extinction allows escape of enough of this radiation . in such environments , ultraviolet studies of star - forming regions",
    "have proven fruitful in understanding these populations .",
    "the recent opening of the far - ultraviolet window , between lyman @xmath2 and the lyman limit , for deep observations , allows study of massive hot stars in a range where they fully dominate the spectrum .",
    "this relatively narrow band contains an embarrassment of spectral riches , with numerous lines from stellar winds as well as interstellar material both atomic and molecular .",
    "these include the strong and highly - ionized lines of o vi and the unique ability to measure cold h@xmath0 .",
    "in addition , this piece of the spectrum is accessible for high - redshift galaxies , at least for composite samples where the lyman @xmath2 forest can be averaged adequately , allowing the possibility of direct comparisons of stellar populations over a large span of cosmic time .",
    "the very sensitivity of the far - uv light to star formation and reddening makes it a purer probe of some properties of star - forming regions than observations at longer wavelengths .",
    "since only short - lived stars contribute significantly in the far - uv range , the details of star - forming history should matter only for very brief bursts ( such as might be found in individual h ii regions , but are less likely on galaxy scales ) .",
    "this makes the far - uv spectrum more sensitive to the stellar population itself than to its history .",
    "furthermore , although the extinction is high , its differential effect across the far - uv band is modest , and paradoxically the effective reddening to the stars we see is smaller than found at longer wavelengths . in observing stars",
    "intermingled with highly structured dust distributions , the  picket - fence \" effect ( heisler & ostriker 1988 ) means that most of the stars are so reddened as to make no significant contribution in the deep ultraviolet ; all the stars we see are only lightly reddened .",
    "this also reduces the effects of the forest of h@xmath0 absorption features because of the mixing of molecular gas and dust .",
    "observational data on nearby galaxies , before the _ far - ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( fuse ) , were limited to a handful of star - forming systems .",
    "four starburst galaxies were observed using hut on _ astro-2 _ ( leitherer et al . 1995 , 2002 ) , largely to measure escaping radiation in the lyman continuum , which provided initial data for comparison with models based on stellar spectra dating back to _",
    "copernicus_. the strongest features fall into two blends near 970 ( ly @xmath3 + c iii ) and 1030    ( o vi + ly @xmath4 + c ii ) .",
    "a _ voyager 2 _ observation of m33 , with some spatial resolution in one direction , was analyzed by keel ( 1998 ) , showing that its far - uv continuum is virtually identical to those of the powerful starbursts , and that ngc 604 is bluer in this range than the overall disk .",
    "these data also suggested significant lyman @xmath2 emission , with spatial profile suggesting an origin in the diffuse ism rather than giant h ii regions .",
    "ironically , until the availability of fuse observations , the richest information on galaxies shortward of lyman @xmath2 came from objects at high redshift , particularly composite spectra of lyman - break galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "2001 , shapley et al . 2003 ) . to enable comparisons between local , well - studied star - forming systems and these powerful , young objects",
    ", we have undertaken a series of fuse observations of star - forming regions innearby galaxies .",
    "we present here the analysis of these spectra in the context of their stellar populations and systematic changes with metallicity . a companion paper ( keel , shapley , & steidel 2004 )",
    "considers the comparison with composite spectra of lyman - break galaxies .",
    "the fuse targets were selected for known high uv flux and hence low reddening , and to span a range of metallicity .",
    "the regions targeted in m33 include the brightest h ii regions in the mid - uv , and span a radial range within the disk from 1.6 - 4.5 kpc ( see fig .",
    "they also include examples with a single dominant star cluster and with multiple clusters or more diffuse associations ( also illustrated in fig .",
    "1 using hst data at 1700   ) . none of the objects in m33 or m101 achieves  super star cluster \" ( ssc ) status , if we follow common usage in requiring not only high luminosity and stellar mass ( melnick , moles & terlevich 1985 ) but that the stars be concentrated into a single clump on 10-pc scales as noted by such studies as that of meurer et al .",
    "while ngc 604 has the right luminosity , its stars are widely spread throughout a 100-pc region including multiple clumps ( hunter et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the more distant systems , the fuse aperture samples multiple regions ; fig .",
    "2 shows the bluest archival hst imagery with the aperture superimposed . in ngc 7714 , there are @xmath5 luminous sscs , comparably luminous in the near - uv , within the aperture , more clearly shown in the inset to fig .",
    "2 . in each of these cases ,",
    "essentially the entire star - forming region fits within the aperture , an important desideratum in comparing these observations with global measurements of distant galaxies .",
    "for each of these objects , there are abundance measurements from the traditional optical emission lines , which we use as an widely - applicable tracer of the abundances of recently - formed stars as well .",
    "the m33 objects span much of its disk s abundance gradient , while ngc 5461 and the nucleus of ngc 7714 were selected to sample lower and higher metallicity .",
    "we also analyze the summed archival fuse spectrum of i zw 18 from aloisi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , as a comparison with the lowest known gas - phase abundances .",
    "table 1 includes our adopted values from the literature for [ o / h ] , the best - measured of the abundances due to the optical lines from multiple ionization stages of oxygen and its importance as a coolant .",
    "the fuse optical system and detectors are described by moos et al .",
    "four primary mirrors are used to feed independent detectors optimized for subsections of the far - uv band ; maintaining the coalignment of these optical systems is an important operational issue .",
    "each detector has a distinct wavelength calibration , but for our purposes , we are not pushing the resolution limit of fuse and can combine the various data segments in 0.1-   pixels .    as shown in figs .",
    "1 and 2 , the fuse pointing positions were set at the midpoint of the stellar distributions from available uv images .",
    "the large 30 \" aperture was specified for the m33 and m101 h ii regions at the outset , both for flux integrity in alignment of the four instrumental channels and to include essentially all their starlight , and adopted for ngc 7714 as well when the performance penalty for using a smaller aperture became clear during the mission .",
    "the requested center coordinates and total exposure times are listed in table 1 .    of these objects ,",
    "ngc 604 is the brightest in the far - uv range by a factor 10 , and will thus play a continued role in our knowledge of stellar populations in this spectral range . in each of these spectra ,",
    "the useful resolution is limited by the signal - to - noise ratio , dictating the wavelength binning to detect features of interest .",
    "for ngc 604 , we can work at 0.1-   binning , for a velocity spacing typically 30 km s@xmath6 . only in this object",
    "does it ( marginally ) matter that it is not a point source , with starlight coming from most of the aperture area .",
    "this smearing along the dispersion axis contributes a broadening of about 60 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the spectra were processed through the fuse pipeline ; we inspected the two - dimensional spectra to verify data quality and background subtraction , and to note such effects as the  worm \" , a shadowing of the detector by a repeller wire , near the red end of some spectra .",
    "each of our targets was observed during two orbits , so we could compare each orbit s summed spectra as a check on the errors at each wavelength .",
    "loss of flux due to the  worm \" does occur in some of the spectra around from 11701180  , a range which does not affect any of the features we analyze .",
    "similarly , there are spurious emission features near 1044 and 1169    which are second - order scattered solar features , which do not seriously confuse features of interest . for clarity of illustration , we interpolate across terrestrial airglow features in ly @xmath4 , ly @xmath3 and o i at the highest resolution before further averaging and display .",
    "we also use the summed archival spectrum of i zw 18 described by aloisi et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who kindly provided it in electronic form .",
    "we compare the spectra of ngc 604 and i zw 18 at 0.1-   resolution in fig .",
    "3 , showing foreground absorption from h@xmath0 , atomic absorption lines in the foreground and in these galaxies , and prominent stellar - wind lines .",
    "we draw on additional data from a variety of sources for these well - observed objects .",
    "iue spectra in the large @xmath7-arcsecond apertures give mid - uv spectra in roughly matched apertures ; we have collected spectra from the archive , rejecting those with obviously discrepant pointings or flux levels from the combined spectra .",
    "hst imaging is invaluable in examining the stellar populations , resolving the brightest stars in each of these associations .",
    "archival wfpc2 data exist for each of the m33 regions in f170w plus longer - wavelength filters , so we can assess the stellar statistics at least into the mid - ultraviolet .",
    "the best uv images of ngc 604 were taken in support of a slitless - spectroscopy program , using the stis nuv - mama detector working at 1800 - 2700   .",
    "each of these stellar collections ionizes a substantial surrounding region .",
    "h@xmath2 data ( as in bosch et al .",
    "2002 ) show structure extending 200 - 800 pc .",
    "all four of the m33 regions fit their description of an evolved h ii region , one in which star formation has been long enough to generate extensive filaments and loops driven by stellar energy input ; they estimate ages @xmath8 myr for all except ngc 604 , at 3 myr , for the current episode of star formation ( matching the conclusions of gonzalez delgado & perez 2000 ) .",
    "stars which contribute strongly in the far - uv have spectral types b0 and earlier , for ages up to 15 myr .",
    "however , the continuum slopes of the shorter - lived o stars vary only slightly across the far - uv range , so the continuum offers little signature of the recent star - forming history ( robert et al . 2001 ) . to this point ,",
    "the far - uv line behavior is not well enough calibrated to infer the star - forming history independently .",
    "the far - uv range is rich in narrow absorption lines from the ism , both ionic and molecular .",
    "the spectrum of ngc 604 is especially complex , with over 100 detected and identified transitions .",
    "foreground h@xmath0 in the milky way is so prominent in all these objects that it must be carefully accounted for in identifying intrinsic absorption features . for the strongest fe ii lines , we detect not only the m33 ism ( at about -200 km s@xmath6 ) , but the foreground high - velocity cloud structure near -370 km s@xmath6 described by wakker et al .",
    "( 2003 ) .",
    "numerous atomic absorption features are seen in these spectra , with stronger absorption in most cases from foreground milky way gas .",
    "their strengths in the integrated spectra will reflect the distribution of gas toward the stellar associations weighted by contribution to the far - uv flux ; for these extensive distributions of stars , derived column densities should be regarded as characteristic values .",
    "the lyman and werner band systems of h@xmath0 are at once an advantage and a nuisance in far - uv spectroscopy , detected in almost every line of sight crossing a significant distance in our own galaxy s ism .",
    "a total of 56 such lines are individually detected in ngc 604 .",
    "the h@xmath0 features in these m33 data have also been analyzed by bluhm et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , who found that h@xmath0 absorption at the velocities appropriate for disk gas in m33 is weakly detected in ngc 588 , 592 , and 595 , at column densities n(h@xmath0)= @xmath9 @xmath10 , but only an upper limit @xmath11 could be derived for ngc 604 , despite the higher data quality and comparable column densities from atomic lines , with all the values approximate due to the lines being too weak for independent measurement of the doppler - width @xmath12 parameter .",
    "bluhm et al . also present instructive simulations on the difficulty of deriving unique column densities when the background source consists of stars spanning a range of column density and position within the spectroscopic aperture .",
    "for example , the nondetection in ngc 604 might result from patchy extinction , correlated with the h@xmath0 distribution , and the far - uv background flux being dominated by those stars with the shallowest h@xmath0 absorption .",
    "this will act in addition to any physical effects related to the radiation field and shocks in the vicinity of such an active star - forming region .",
    "these regions are certainly associated with large concentrations of molecular gas ; all three of them within the survey area of engargiola et al . ( 2003 ) are associated with molecular clouds ( ngc 592 , 595 , and 604 with their clouds 40 , 32 , and 8 , respectively ) .",
    "their h@xmath0 masses are estimated in the range @xmath13 solar masses .    in spite of these issues in physical interpretation of molecular absorption ,",
    "the empirical results are directly comparable to what we may see in high - redshift systems , as this spectral region becomes accessible for at least composite study in lyman - break galaxies ( shapley et al .",
    "we can use both the sets of h@xmath0 line strengths seen from galactic gas in these spectra , and synthetic absorption spectra , to ask what signatures of molecular absorption remain at modest spectral resolution .",
    "the least confusion with other spectral features for modest h@xmath0 column densities occurs for blends of features near 1005 and 1072  .",
    "the wavelengths and shapes of these blends depend on the spin - level populations in the gas , generally shifting to longer wavelengths for warmer gas ( mccandliss 2003 ) .",
    "we have re - examined the ngc 604 spectrum for evidence of associated h@xmath0 absorption . the ability to see such features at low redshift",
    "is limited largely by blending with foreground galactic features , since the spacing between multiplet members provides ample opportunity for overlap . for atomic absorption species",
    ", we find a difference between foreground and m33 absorption typically 220 km s@xmath6 , which gives wavelength shifts very close to the spacing of low - order members of the h@xmath0 multiplets near 963 , 982 , 1002 , and 1014   . as a result",
    ", only the bluest members of these multiplets could be securely detected from gas near the velocity of ngc 604 in the presence of the much stronger foreground gas . to guard against unrecognized atomic features",
    ", we also require that a putative ngc 604 feature not be seen in the i zw 18 spectrum at the corresponding _ emitted _ wavelength .",
    "compared to 56 h@xmath0 lines seen from foreground milky way gas , only two potential detections resulted for ngc 604 .",
    "these are the transitions at rest wavelengths 1001.69 ( @xmath14 ) and 1008.38 ( @xmath15 ) at equivalent widths of roughly 0.02 and 0.08   , respectively .",
    "the 1008 line , with better s / n ratio , appears substantially broader , with a profile compatible with that of the other narrow features .",
    "if accurate , these detections are insufficient to derive the absorbing column density , lacking information on the intrinsic doppler broadening and level populations .",
    "if we adopt the  optimum \" @xmath12-value 10 km s@xmath6 for the ngc 588 and 592 detections from bluhm et al . , and",
    "incorporating the h@xmath0ools template models described by mccandliss 2003 , we derive n(h@xmath0)=@xmath16 @xmath10 from this single transition and assuming the same mix of level populations as in the foreground gas .",
    "hotter molecular gas could give comparable absorption at column densities several times lower , close to the bluhm et al . limit .",
    "lines arising in the states @xmath17 are seen in the foreground milky way gas , well below the saturated level that drove rachford et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to use detailed profile fitting . as in their work",
    ", we also find significant changes in derived n(h@xmath0 ) between various absorption bands .",
    "we follow them in obtaining a characteristic kinetic temperature from the level populations in @xmath18 as @xmath19 for the ngc 604 foreground h@xmath0 spectrum , we obtained @xmath20 k , at the high end of values seen by rachford et al . for dense and self - shielded environments but reasonable for the more diffuse ",

    "most of the stellar signature in far - uv spectra occurs in the wind lines , which dominate this spectral range thanks to the numerous resonance transitions of metals .",
    "both the wind lines and the evolutionary tracks when winds are important should have strong metallicity dependences , since the radiation pressure driving the winds acts largely through the opacity of heavy elements .",
    "this behavior has been shown , albeit sometimes in complex ways , upon comparison of stellar spectra from the milky way and magellanic clouds .",
    "leitherer et al .",
    "( 2001 ) examined wind lines in the mid - uv , notably c iv , from smc to galactic abundances , confirming a significant metallicity dependence in its strength but noting than ionization states other than the dominant ones can behave differently as secondary abundance effects shift the ionization balance in the winds ( as seen in si iv , which is stronger in lmc stars than the milky way ) .",

    "mid - uv stis images ( central wavelengths 1820 - 2700  ) obtained in support of a slitless - spectroscopy program by j. mais - apellaniz show , via the finer pixel sampling , that there are additional spatially resolved companions to each of the brightest stars identified by bruhweiler et al . , although none so bright as to bias the measured colors or magnitudes .",
    "ngc 604 also contains significant numbers of wr stars , although with a wr / o star ratio near 0.1 rather than the 0.3 seen in , for example , ngc 595 ( drissen , moffat , & shara 1993 ) .    to compare the populations in these h ii regions as they affect the integrated far - uv spectra , we produced color - magnitude arrays for each based on the archival wfpc2 data in f170w and f555w ( as well as intermediate - wavelength data when available ) .",
    "lacking imagery in the far - uv band itself , we use the mid - uv properties as proxies to at least identify the hottest luminous stars .",
    "reddening corrections do not enter for our immediate purposes , since we need to know only how many stars contribute to the uv flux and extinction does not varying greatly between 1700 and 1100   .",
    "bruhweiler et al .",
    "find , for stars in ngc 604 , that the 1100-   extinction is about 1.5 times that at 1700  .",
    "likewise , we are interested here only in stars selected from uv flux , so the diagrams sample only those stars well detected in the mid - uv data .",
    "these observational hr diagrams are shown in fig .",
    "we include only stars without serious crowding issues , measured within 0.3 \" radii .",
    "the samples include stars to about @xmath45 on the stmag scale ( based on flux per unit wavelength ) , although the completeness varies considerably even at @xmath46 because of differences in crowding ; for ngc 604 , the cumulative counts with flux suggest statistical completeness only above @xmath47 .",
    "the brightest stars in the rich population of ngc 604 are 1.5 - 2 magnitudes brighter than found in any of the other associations .",
    "the color range among uv - bright stars in ngc 588 is smallest , extending from the blue envelope near @xmath48 redward only to -2.0 , while all the other regions have the diagram populated to @xmath49 , and in ngc 604 to 2.4 .",
    "this may in part be a reddening issue , since the stellar distribution in ngc 588 is more compact , with less scope for differential reddening across the association , than the others . indeed , dust lanes are prominent in the continuum images of ngc 604 in both the optical continuum and uv / optical colors ; it is clear observationally that the uv reflects only the least - extinguished stars in this object .",
    "the observed color distribution in ngc 604 is rich in the bluest stars , but these stars are also represented with similar color in ngc 588 and 595 .",
    "a more important difference is that the richer population in ngc 604 includes several stars with f170w magnitude brighter than seen in any of the other clusters . while richness effects mean that the brighter star - forming regions will have brighter first - ranked stars , the studies referenced above suggest that ngc 604 has undergone a distinct burst of star formation about 3 myr ago , younger than the other regions , an event which is recent enough to leave its mark on the massive - star population .",
    "we now focus on these brightest stars .",
    "these data allow us to address how much the brightest stars dominate the mid - uv flux in each case , incorporating the total f170w flux within the fuse aperture .",
    "fluctuations in the bright population could affect the integrated spectra of the lower - luminosity , sparser regions more strongly simply from statistics , but the detailed recent history of star formation will enter through aging as well .",
    "given the temperature range of these stars ( @xmath50 k following bruhweiler et al . )",
    ", the hottest stars should be more dominant at the shorter wavelengths of the fuse data .",
    "it is not clear that all the far - uv flux is from direct starlight ; hill et al .",
    "( 1995a , b ) and malamuth et al .",
    "( 1996 ) showed evidence that a significant fraction of mid - uv light from similar systems is scattered .",
    "the hst f300w image of ngc 604 shows reflection nebulosity , and smoothed versions of the mid - uv stis images match its morphology , indicating that scattering important at shorter wavelengths as well , as would be expected for a roughly @xmath51 rayleigh behavior . since the fuse aperture is not much larger than the stellar distribution in ngc 604 , the widths of narrow absorption features are not a sensitive test of whether scattering is important at these wavelengths .",
    "we do see a role for scattering around some of the brightest stars in the hst stis image at 2400   , from analysis of the point - spread functions of stars .",
    "this is easier to interpret than the distinct emission and absorption structures , since reflected continuum can be confused with emission from the weak [ o ii ] doublet near 2471   .",
    "some of the stars match the nominal psf closely , while two of the brightest ones exhibit excess light from 0.3 - 1.0 \" from the core .",
    "this excess contains as much of 28% of the mid - uv light in the brightest case .",
    "these data leave open the possibility that scattered light is important at the shorter far - uv wavelengths .",
    "we therefore bracket the total uv flux between the sum of detected stars and the large - aperture sum . for larger fractions of scattered light ,",
    "the brightest individual stars are more dominant , since the total number of stars producing the observed light is smaller .",
    "cumulative distributions of f170w magnitude are shown in fig .",
    "8 , along with simple geometric estimates of corrections for crowding ( which are small , but underestimate the actual effect where stars are more clumped than random within the h ii region ) .",
    "accumulating the flux from the bright stars , we find that only about 20% of the total flux within the fuse aperture at 1700    comes directly from the stars , less than half of what bruhweiler et al .",
    "( 2003 ) find at 1200    within a narrow slit .",
    "this may be a sign that scattering is important , since much of the scattered light we see at mid - uv wavelengths in the hst imagery is on larger scales than this .",
    "in contrast , as a fraction of the light _ from detected stars _ , the brightest ten ( a good approximation to the stars brighter than any found in the other h ii regions ) contribute about 40% , more in line with the bruhweiler et al . results .",
    "this also makes sense for these stars being able to affect the overall spectrum .",
    "however , the high temperature needed for the excess component in ngc 604 means that we are seeing a difference in history rather than simply small - number statistics in what stars appear at a given time .",
    "in general , metallicity will be manifested in the composite spectra both directly , through photospheric and wind lines , and indirectly , as the evolutionary tracks of stars change with abundances .",
    "effects on the initial - mass function are too small to see at the abundances found in the m33 disk , as shown by malamuth et al .",
    "( 1996 ) for some of the same h ii regions we observed .",
    "they suggest that the excitation trends seen in the associated ionized gas result from the different emergent ionizing fluxes for stars at various metallicities . however , different evolutionary histories are still implied by the strong changes in wind properties seen with metallicity .",
    "comparison of the our spectra suggests that very recent events in the star - formation history do have observable impact in the far - uv , as exemplified by ngc 604 .",
    "its mix includes light from a greater fraction of hot stars than the other systems , which fits with the other properties of this region in suggesting a burst so recent that even in the far - uv , it does not look like constant star - formation ( in this case , ages @xmath52 myr ) . in general , the timescales may be metallicity - dependent ; robert et al .",
    "( 2003 ) show that evolved o i / iii and b i / iii stars appear later at lower abundances .",
    "we have used fuse spectra of star - forming regions in nearby galaxies , whose gas - phase metallicities range from 0.05 - 0.8 solar , to explore the utility of far - ultraviolet spectra in measuring the abundances in star - forming galaxies , as well as to probe the massive - star populations in these galaxies .",
    "the absorption lines from radiatively - driven winds prove to be very sensitive to metal abundance ; all six strong and unblended species ( including c iv from archival iue data ) have a strong , monotonic metallicity dependence . for n iv , c iii , and p",
    "v , the relation between straighforward equivalent - width values and oxygen abundance from emission - line spectra is closely linear , suggesting that these lines will be useful in tracing the chemical history of galaxies from @xmath40 , beyond which the lyman @xmath2 forest makes even composite spectra progressively less informative .",
    "the continuum of ngc 604 departs from the uniform shape of the other objects below 950  . after considering the effects of small - number statistics among the massive stars in these objects ,",
    "we conclude that this difference probably traces to a discrete burst of star formation @xmath1 myr ago in ngc 604 .",
    "this region had been considered by several previous studies to have hoisted such a burst , on grounds of both morphology of the gas and fitting of the h - r diagram .",
