    "the group @xmath0 is a favourite candidate for grand unified theories ( guts )  @xcite because its 16-dimensional irreducible representation ( irrep ) , the spinor representation , contains all chiral fermions included in a standard model ( sm ) family plus an additional neutrino sm gauge singlet .",
    "moreover , such theories allow for type  i  @xcite and type  ii  @xcite seesaw mechanisms ( see also  @xcite ) for the light neutrino masses . in the construction of @xmath0 theories",
    ", there are two options  @xcite , either using low - dimensional scalar irreps but accepting non - renormalizable terms in the lagrangian , or one sticks to renormalizable terms , then one has to accept high - dimensional scalar irreps according to  @xcite @xmath2 where the subscripts `` s '' and `` as '' denote , respectively , the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the tensor product .    in this paper , we deal with the second option .",
    "a special renormalizable model is the so - called `` minimal susy @xmath0 gut '' ( msgut )  @xcite , which uses , for the yukawa couplings , one scalar in the @xmath3 and one in the @xmath4 irrep in order to account for all fermion masses and mixings ; it contains , in addition , one @xmath5 and one @xmath6 scalar irrep , in order to perform the suitable symmetry breakings .",
    "this model has built - in the gauge - coupling unification of the minimal susy extension of the standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "detailed studies of this minimal theory have been performed  @xcite , also with small effects of the 120-plet  @xcite .",
    "though the msgut works very well in the fermion sector , there is a tension between the scale of the light neutrino masses and the gut scale .",
    "the reason is that the natural order of the neutrino masses in guts is @xmath7 ev , where we have used @xmath8 gev for the electroweak scale and a gut scale of @xmath9 gev .",
    "this neutrino mass scale is too low because @xmath10 ev where @xmath11 is the atmospheric neutrino mass - squared difference  for reviews on the status of neutrino masses and mixing see  @xcite .",
    "studies of the heavy scalar states  @xcite , together with studies of the fermion mass spectrum , have shown that the msgut is too constrained  @xcite , and the tension between the scale of light neutrino masses and the gut scale can not be overcome : if one has a good fit of the fermion masses , which requires a seesaw scale below @xmath12 , then the gauge coupling unification of the mssm  @xcite is spoiled .",
    "a natural step for supplying additional degrees of freedom to the msgut is to add the 120-plet of scalars  @xcite which appears anyway in eq .",
    "( [ tensor])for early works in this direction see  @xcite .",
    "alone does not give a good fit in the charged fermion sector  @xcite . ]",
    "the disadvantage is that this step adds a considerable number of parameters and reduces the predictability of the theory . adding the @xmath13 leads to a resurgence of the type  i seesaw mechanism  @xcite , as a consequence of the collapse of the seesaw scale with the gut scale , because type  i seesaw allows to enhance the neutrino masses through small yukawa couplings of the @xmath14  @xcite ; without the @xmath13 , i.e. in the msgut , this process leads to the contradictions mentioned above .",
    "the @xmath13 has electrically neutral components only in its four doublets with respect to the sm gauge group .",
    "these contribute to the higgs doublets @xmath15 , @xmath16 of the mssm , which are assumed to be the only light scalar degrees of freedom and the only ones which acquire vevs at the electroweak scale .",
    "thus the msgut enlarged by the @xmath13 inherits , from the msgut , the scalar fields responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking above the electroweak scale . in  @xcite we took this into account by explicitly making the identification @xmath17 where @xmath18 , which defines the seesaw scale , is the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of @xmath19 , with the usual notation for multiplets of the pati ",
    "salam subgroup  @xcite @xmath20 of @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , in that paper we reduced the number of parameters in the fermion mass matrices by assuming a horizontal @xmath21 symmetry and spontaneous cp violation , i.e. real yukawa couplings , with cp violation stemming from the phases of the vevs .",
    "we showed numerically that this scenario can excellently reproduce the known fermion masses and mixings .",
    "recently , the role of spontaneous cp violation has been upgraded .",
    "a `` new msgut '' ( nmsgut ) was proposed  @xcite , defined by extending the msgut by the @xmath13 and spontaneous cp violation .",
    "it was shown that the requirement of spontaneous cp violation not only has the virtue of reducing the number of parameters of the theory but it has an important impact , via threshold effects , on the unification scale as well ; it tends to raise the unification scale and with it the masses of all heavy multiplets , thereby suppressing baryon decay .    in the present paper we retain eq .",
    "( [ onescale ] ) as a reference point .",
    "we do not employ any horizontal symmetry but we again motivate real yukawa coupling matrices by spontaneous cp violation .",
    "however , we assume that it is of a very specific kind : cp is solely violated by imaginary vevs of the @xmath13 ; the vevs of the @xmath22 and @xmath14 are assumed to be real . in this way",
    ", the mass matrices of the down - quarks , up - quarks , charged leptons and the neutrino dirac - mass matrix are hermitian .",
    "this scenario was originally proposed in  @xcite , its compatibility with sufficiently slow proton decay shown in  @xcite . however , in  @xcite it was assumed that the type  ii seesaw mechanism is dominating .",
    "since this is incompatible with having only one large scale , we have in the present paper type  i dominance and neglect possible small contributions of type  ii , suppressed by @xmath23 .",
    "our scenario gives an excellent fit to all known fermion masses , mixings and the ckm phase @xmath24 , as good as the one in  @xcite , though it is of a rather different type .",
    "this shows that the fermion data do not fix the enlarged msgut in a unique way and there is considerable freedom in reducing the number of parameters in this theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ cpviolation ]",
    "we discuss cp - invariant yukawa couplings and lay out our scenario . the method and results of our numerical analysis",
