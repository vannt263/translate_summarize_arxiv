    "recent measurements of luminosity distances using supernovae type ia ( snia ) @xcite , of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) temperature anisotropies with the wilkinson microwave anisotropy ( wmap ) satellite @xcite , large scale structure @xcite , the integrated sachs ",
    "wolfe effect @xcite , and weak lensing @xcite , strongly suggest that the universe is currently undergoing a phase of accelerated expansion -see",
    "@xcite for recent reviews . within general relativity",
    "the obvious candidate to explain the present acceleration is the cosmological constant ( or vacuum energy ) , and in fact the nave model built on it , @xmath3cdm , seems to pass reasonably well all cosmological tests .",
    "however , it suffers from two serious drawbacks from the theoretical side : the unnatural low value of the corresponding energy density , 123 magnitude orders larger than observed , and the so - called  coincidence problem \" , namely ,  why are the densities of matter and vacuum of the same order precisely today ? \" , that requires the vacuum energy density to be 96 orders of magnitude smaller than the matter density at the planck scale .",
    "( it is fair , however , to mention the existence of proposals in which a vacuum energy density of about the right order of magnitude stems from the casimir effect at cosmic scales -see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this is why much attention has been devoted to models featuring an evolving and nearly un - clustered form of energy , usually dubbed  dark energy \" , possessing a strong negative pressure high enough to drive late acceleration -see",
    "@xcite for an ample review of models .    for simplicity",
    ", most cosmological models assume that matter and dark energy interact gravitationally only . in the absence of an underlying symmetry that would suppress a matter - dark energy coupling ( or interaction )",
    "there is no a priori reason to dismiss it .",
    "further , the coupling is not only likely but inevitable @xcite and its introduction is not more arbitrary than assuming it to vanish . on the other hand , it may help explain the coincidence problem . ultimately , this question will have to be resolved observationally . among other things ,",
    "the interaction can push the beginning of the era of accelerated expansion to higher redshifts and it may erroneously suggest ( if the interaction is ignored when interpreting the data ) an equation of state for the dark energy of phantom type -see @xcite and references therein .",
    "another question , is the form of the coupling .",
    "there is no clear consensus on this point and different versions , that arise from a variety of motivations , coexist in the literature .",
    "cosmological models where dark matter ( dm ) and dark energy ( de ) do not evolve separately but interact with each other were first introduced to justify the small current value of the cosmological constant @xcite and nowadays there is a growing body of literature on the subject -see , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "recently , various proposals at the fundamental level , including field lagrangians , have been advanced to account for the coupling @xcite .",
    "lagrangians of scalar field coupled to matter generically do not generate scaling solutions with a dark matter dominated period lasting long enough as required by cosmic structure formation @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we compare the interacting quintessence model ( iqm ) of chimento _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( see also its forerunner @xcite ) with observational data ( supernovae , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , and matter power spectrum ) to set limits on the strength of the interaction dm / de .",
    "the model was built to simultaneously account for the late phase of acceleration in the framework of einstein relativity and significantly alleviates the coincidence problem .",
    "it evades the limits set in @xcite and is compatible with a right succession of cosmic eras -radiation , dark matter , and dark energy dominated expansions . in a recent paper , guo _",
    "et al . _ also set constraints on interacting quintessence models @xcite .",
    "however , the interactions studied by these authors differ from the one in @xcite , and while they use the cosmic background shift parameter and baryon acoustic oscillations alongside supernovae data to constrain the interaction , they do not consider the matter power spectrum , whereby our analysis may be viewed as complementary to theirs .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "next section studies the critical points of the autonomous system of equations associated to the iqm @xcite .",
    "section iii considers the restrictions set by amendola _",
    "et al . _ on the model to conclude that the latter evades these restrictions and , in particular , that an early epoch of baryon dominance is possible only if the strength of interaction is unnaturally large ( beyond the limits set by the cmb data ) .",
    "section iv focus on the observational bounds coming from the cmb , matter power spectrum and recent supernovae type ia data .",
    "finally , section v summarizes our results .",
    "if the quintessence de decays into dm , both energy densities evolve differently than in non - interacting quintessence cosmologies and , therefore , the interaction can be tested by its effects on the dynamical evolution of the universe . due to the interaction ,",
    "the fraction of cold dark matter ( cdm ) at any time in the past is smaller than in non - interacting models with the same cosmological parameters today .",
    "since the dark matter energy density grows more slowly the beginning of the period of accelerated expansion and the temporal evolution of the gravitational potential differ from non - interacting models .",
    "observables such as the angular and luminosity distances depend on the time evolution of the energy density . but the effect does not only occurs at zeroth order ; the evolution of first order matter density perturbations is also affected and so is the pattern of anisotropies of the cmb .",
    "this section describes the dynamical evolution of dark matter and dark energy densities at zeroth order in the interacting quintessence model of ref .",
    "@xcite to point out the main differences with respect to models with no interaction .    the phenomenological model of chimento _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite ( see also @xcite ) assumes that the dark energy decays into cold dark matter thereby both energy densities do not longer evolve separately . in @xcite",
    "the following ansatz was adopted + @xmath4 + where @xmath5 denotes the energy densities ( subscript @xmath6 for cold dark matter and subscript @xmath7 for dark energy ) , @xmath8 is the equation of state parameter of dark energy , @xmath9 the hubble function and @xmath10 the scale factor of the flat friedmann - robertson - walker metric .",
    "the model assumes that the dark energy decays just into cold dark matter and not into any other component such as neutrinos , baryons , or photons .",
    "decay into neutrinos have been recently studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the coupling with baryons is constrained by measurements of local gravity @xcite .",
    "the above ansatz is essentially phenomenological ; it is the simplest interaction model that leads to a constant ratio at early and late times which certainly alleviates the coincidence problem . while at present a rigorous derivation from first principles",
    "does not exist , the ansatz may be roughly justified as follows : the right hand side of both equations in ( [ cont ] ) must be functions , say @xmath11 and @xmath12 , of the energy densities multiplied by a quantity with units of inverse of time . for the latter",
    "the obvious choice is the hubble factor @xmath13 , so we have that @xmath14 . by power law expanding @xmath11 and retaining just the first term we get @xmath15 . to facilitate comparison of the model with observation",
    "it is suitable to eliminate one the two @xmath16 parameters .",
    "thus we set @xmath17 and arrive to eq .",
    "( [ cont ] ) . the simpler choice @xmath18 would not yield a constant dark matter to dark energy ratio at late times .",
    "the dimensionless term @xmath19 measures to what extent the decay rate differs from the expansion rate of the universe .",
    "thus , the model is characterized by this single parameter , @xmath20 , which also gauges the intensity of the interaction .",
    "the lower @xmath21 , the closer the evolution of the universe to a non - interacting model is .",
    "equations in ( [ cont ] ) , the continuity equations for photons and baryons and friedmann equation @xmath22 , constitute a closed system . in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] we plot the evolution of the different matter density components : cold dark matter ( thick solid line ) , dark energy ( thin solid ) , photons ( thin dot - dashed ) and baryons ( thick dot - dashed ) for two values of the interaction parameter : left and right panels correspond to @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively . in the figure",
    "we can see that eqs .",
    "( [ cont ] ) have two asymptotic solutions with @xmath25 constant : at early times and in the immediate future .",
    "it is easy to prove that , in these two cases , @xmath26 and the constant ratio is @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "these results represent a clear conceptual advantage with respect to the @xmath3cdm model .",
    "if the present acceleration of the universe is generated by a cosmological constant , then the initial values of dark matter and cosmological constant have to be tuned by 96 orders of magnitude at planck time , i.e. , @xmath29 . in the model described above this ratio",
    "is fixed by the interaction rate , @xmath21 .",
    "the initial condition problem is significantly alleviated .",
    "for example , if @xmath30 the initial dark matter to dark energy ratio will be @xmath31 .    to study the evolution of the corresponding autonomous system formed by the continuity equations of all energy components and friedmann s equation we introduce the following set of variables , + @xmath32 + with @xmath33 .",
    "then , the dynamical equations can be recast as + @xmath34x \\ , , \\vspace*{.2cm}\\\\ y^{\\prime}&=&{\\displaystyle\\frac}{1}{2}\\left[3w_{x}x^2+u^2 + 3c^2{\\displaystyle}\\left(1+{\\displaystyle\\frac}{x^2}{y^2}\\right)\\right]y      \\ , , \\vspace*{.2cm}\\\\ z^{\\prime}&=&{\\displaystyle\\frac}{1}{2}\\left[3w_{x}x^2+u^2\\right]z \\ , , \\vspace*{.2cm}\\\\ u^{\\prime}&=&{\\displaystyle\\frac}{1}{2}\\left[3w_{x}x^2+u^2 - 1\\right]u\\ , , \\vspace*{.2cm}\\\\ 1 & = & x^2+y^2+z^2+u^2 \\ , , \\vspace*{.2cm}\\\\ \\end{array}\\ ] ] + where a prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath35 . as said above",
    ", the motivation for interacting quintessence models is to solve or , at least , ameliorate the coincidence problem .",
    "a solution will be achieved if the system ( [ contnew ] ) presents scaling solutions @xcite .",
    "as already discussed , scaling solutions are characterized by a constant dark matter to dark energy ratio .",
    "even more important are those scaling solutions that are also an attractor . in this way ,",
    "the coincidence problem gets substantially alleviated because , regardless of the initial conditions , the system evolves toward a final state where the ratio of dark matter to dark energy stays constant .",

[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      the matter power spectrum has been recently derived from two different galaxy catalogs : 2-degree field red galaxy survey ( 2dfrgs ) @xcite , that comprises a sample of more than @xmath36 galaxies with measured redshifts , and the luminous red galaxy sample ( lrgs ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite .",
    "a larger study , using the sdss data release 5 , and comprising more than half a million galaxies showed similar results @xcite . in @xcite , the power spectrum from the sdss was computed producing uncorrelated minimum - variance measurements in 20 @xmath37-bands of the clustering power and its anisotropy due to redshift - distortions , with narrow and well - behaved windows functions in the range @xmath38 @xmath39 .",
    "we used these data to fit the theoretical power spectrum , @xmath40 , calculated with a modified cmbfast software and thus constrain the parameters of the cosmological model .",
    "table [ tab : priors1 ] shows the priors imposed on the parameters in our mcmcs runs .",
    "in addition , we allowed the bias parameter to vary in the range @xmath41 .",
    "we run 4 different mcmcs till the criteria of convergence and well mixing were met .",
    "figure [ fig : sdss_c2 ] shows the joint confidence contours of @xmath21 with other representative parameters . like in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2wmap3 ] , contours run almost parallel to the vertical axis . in table",
    "[ exp - values ] we give the cosmological parameters measured from this data set .",
    "we derived an upper limit of @xmath42 at @xmath43 confidence level .",
    "this constraint is weaker than the one provided by wmap 3rd year data , but applies to a different range in redshift .",
    "this bound sets an upper limit on the value of @xmath21 averaged over the whole length of the matter dominated epoch .",
    "varying @xmath44 or the total matter content changes the matter radiation equality and shifts the maximum of @xmath40 to larger scales , but it is around the maximum where the data have less statistical power .",
    "matter and baryons change the amplitude and location of baryon acoustic oscillations but useful constraints can only be obtained by separating the physics of the oscillations from that governing the overall shape of the power spectrum @xcite loosing the information on the interaction . as a result",
    ", we obtained no useful constraints on cosmological parameters except on @xmath21 .",
    "we also run a set of mcmcs for the 2dfgrs data , but while the values of the main cosmological parameters were in very good agreement with those of table [ exp - values ] , the constraints were even poorer than those obtained from the sdss data , so we do not present them here .      at low redshifts ,",
    "only the dark matter and dark energy densities contribute substantially to the dynamical evolution of the universe .",
    "since the interaction alters their relative ratio , it affects the actual distance to objects .",
    "distance measurements , like the luminosity distance , @xmath45 , obtained from standard candles like the snia , are sensitive to the dark energy parameters , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and the strength of the interaction , @xmath21 .",
    "the likelihood function is given by @xcite , + @xmath48 + in this expression , @xmath49 is the distance modulus , @xmath50 is the uncertainty on the supernova redshift ( in units of the distance modulus ) due to its intrinsic motion and the peculiar velocities of the parent galaxy and @xmath51 is the error in the determination of the distance moduli due to photometric uncertainties .",
    "subindexes @xmath52 and @xmath53 indicate theoretical and observed uncertainties , respectively . since the intrinsic luminosity of snia is not known , the distance moduli are insensitive to @xmath44 , only 3 parameters ( @xmath54 , @xmath8 , and @xmath21 ) are needed to characterize a model .",
    "we carried out a brute force analysis sampling homogeneously the parameter space : ( @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 ) ; each interval was subdivided in 10 steps .",
    "figure [ fig : likesn ] shows the confidence intervals for @xmath21 vs @xmath46 after marginalizing over @xmath47 .",
    "we remark that , in this case , the data is almost insensitive to @xmath21 , as we could have expected from fig [ fig : cmb3rd](c ) .      to solve the coincidence problem a decay of de into dm was postulated and , consequently , a new parameter , @xmath20 , was introduced to gauge the strength of the coupling . in this subsection",
    "we explore whether the existence of this coupling ( i.e. , a non - vanishing @xmath20 value ) it is also justified by a statistical description of the data .",
    "the introduction of further parameters will lead to a better fit to the data .",
    "this must be balanced against the loss of predictive power of the theory .",
    "the bayesian information criteria ( defined as @xmath58 @xcite , where @xmath59 , @xmath37 the number of free parameters , and @xmath60 the number of data points ) , penalizes the inclusion of additional parameters to describe data of small size . for the wmap 3yr data @xmath61 and @xmath62 , so the interacting quintessence model for @xmath63 yields a slightly better fit to data than the corresponding non - interacting model .",
    "however , the application of the bayesian criterion gives @xmath64 and @xmath65 , so the introduction of this parameter is not statistically encouraged .",
    "this results disagree with our analysis of wmap 1yr data @xcite .",
    "it was the unexpected consequence of our choice of priors : we fixed all models to agree with the cobe / dmr normalization .",
    "since wmap 1yr concordance model preferred a lower normalization , it was heavily penalized compared with interacting models .",
    "this discrepancy shows the importance of priors in bayesian analysis . as argued in @xcite ,",
    "model selection is not a substitute for parameter fitting ; a lower bic does not imply the data rejects interacting models , just makes them unlikely .",
    "however , they still have a theoretical advantage since they can help explain the coincidence problem , while non - interacting models can not .",
    "let us briefly point out that while the iqm model does not solve the coincidence problem in full ( as it can not predict the present ratio of dark matter to dark energy ) it substantially alleviates it .",
    "indeed , if we take initial conditions at the planck scale , in a model without interaction the ratio @xmath66 at that epoch is about @xmath67 . if @xmath68 , a value compatible with wmap upper limit then , asymptotically , @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the present time .",
    "initially @xmath71 , so , while in a @xmath3cdm model the initial conditions have to be fine - tuned by @xmath72 magnitude orders to get the present accelerated expansion , in the iqm the difference in orders of magnitude is just @xmath73 .",
    "a further advantage is that the model is not limited by the results of ref .",
    "@xcite since it successfully predicts that the universe undergoes three successive cosmic eras of expansion , namely , radiation , matter and dark energy dominance . if the interaction parameter were @xmath74 or larger , it could undergo an era of baryon dominance , but this is not a stable solution and , in any case , @xmath20 values larger than @xmath75 do not appear compatible with cmb data .",
    "the existence of a late accelerated expansion of the universe requires @xmath76 , as in noninteracting models . whether or not the present value of the ratio @xmath66 coincides with the final attractor value depends on the parameters @xmath21 and @xmath8 .",
    "these are unknowns that can be constrained by observation .",
    "our analysis shows that the cmb , matter power spectrum and luminosity distance data only set upper limits on the dm / de coupling and , statistically , the introduction of this extra parameter is not favored by the data . at present",
    ", cmb data sets the tightest upper limit on the strength of the interaction ( @xmath77 ) . as fig .",
    "[ fig : excluded ] reveals , this upper bound can be translated into an excluded region ( shaded area ) for the dark matter to dark energy ratio , @xmath66 .",
    "solid lines , from top to bottom , correspond to @xmath78 and @xmath79 that bounds the shaded area .",
    "as the figure shows , the smaller @xmath21 , the longer it takes to reach the attractor solution .",
    "with wmap 3yr constraint , the attractor solution will be reached only in @xmath80 yr from now .",
    "our upper limits on @xmath21 put pressure on this type of interacting models that , combined with the more generic results of @xcite , show the difficulties that interacting models encounter into explaining the coincidence problem .",
    "if the new wmap 5yr data release sets an even stronger constraint on @xmath21 , the iqm will loose much of its appeal .",
