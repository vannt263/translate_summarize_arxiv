    "there are evidences of anomalies of neutrino flows in various processes occurring on earth , which can not be explained by oscillations of only active , i.e. electron- , muon- and tau - neutrino and antineutrino .",
    "lsnd / miniboone , reactor and gallium anomalies belong to such anomalies ( see abazajian et al . , 2012 ; kopp , et al . , 2014 ) , which could be explained by existence of one or two additional neutrinos noninteracting within the standard model ( sm ) with other particles .",
    "such neutrinos were named as sterile neutrinos .",
    "the characteristic mass scale of the sterile neutrinos , which is responsible for the description of the anomalies noted above is 1  ev .",
    "however , it should be noted that recently obtained observational astrophysical data pertaining to formation of galaxies and their clusters can be explained by existence of sterile neutrinos with the mass of the order of 1  kev or above , and such sterile neutrinos are the candidates for cold dark matter particles ( see dodelson and widrow , 1994 ; kusenko , 2009 ) .",
    "more details about possible existence of sterile neutrinos and their characteristics can be found in numerous papers ( see , for example , liao , 2006 ; abazajian et al . , 2012 ; bellini et al . , 2013 ; conrad et al . , 2013 ; an et al .",

    "( 2014 ) and khruschov and fomichev ( 2015 ) the estimates of masses of three active and three sterile neutrinos were obtained and both the appearance and survival probabilities of active and sterile neutrinos in the sun with accounting of the msw - resonances were calculated .",
    "although in the models with three active and three sterile neutrinos the difficulties exist , which are connected with consistency of a number of effective neutrino types , as well as the sum of their masses with the data of cosmological observations related to primary nucleosynthesis , cmb anisotropy and the observed large - scale structure of the universe ( see komatsu , et al . , 2011 ; ade , et al . , 2013 ) , such consistency depends on the cosmological model used . actually , it is possible to bypass a direct link between the number of additional relativistic degrees of freedom and the number of sterile neutrinos by using more general cosmological models ( see ho and scherrer , 2013 ; gorbunov , 2014 ; and references therein ) . in this paper",
    "we consider for the sake of generality a model with three sterile neutrinos , in which the phenomenological parameters are chosen in order to demonstrate the effect of increase of the sterile neutrino yield at certain conditions .",
    "the taken parameter values do not contradict to the existing experimental limitations .",
    "there is a simple way to suppress the production and thermalization of sterile neutrinos in the early universe , which can be applied in our model , too .",
    "this is reducing or even vanishing the mixing parameters between the active neutrinos and one , two or three sterile neutrinos and disturbing all or some of sterile neutrinos from an thermodynamic equilibrium at early stages of formation of the universe , that is , the model admits a reduction to two or even one sterile neutrino .    in the current paper , the neutrino flavour composition modification due to coherent scattering of a neutrino on both electrons and neutrons",
    "is considered .",
    "the accounting of neutrons does not lead to change of oscillation characteristics , if only the active neutrinos are considered .",
    "but if a contribution of the sterile neutrinos is taken into account , the influence of neutron density becomes noticeable .",
    "moreover , it is shown in the current paper that , when the ratio of a number of neutrons to a number of protons in the matter is close to two , there is a considerable enhancement of the sterile neutrino yield .",
    "such enhancement arises at large or super - large values of density ( @xmath12  g/@xmath13 ) .",
    "therefore , this effect can be of importance only in the astrophysical conditions , for example , at formation of a protoneutron core of a supernova . in the models with participation of the sterile neutrinos",
    "this effect is additional to the msw - effect and can lead to new consequences at supernovae explosions . in spite of the fact that influence of the sterile neutrinos on the processes in supernovae were considered in many papers ( see , for example , hidaka and fuller , 2006 and 2007 ; tamborra , et al .",
