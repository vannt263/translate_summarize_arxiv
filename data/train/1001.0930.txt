    "helioseismology is the observation and interpretation of the solar oscillations to probe the solar interior .",
    "these oscillations , with periods around five minutes , are due to the random superposition of acoustic waves and surface - gravity waves and are excited by turbulent convection in the upper layers of the sun .",
    "solar oscillations were discovered by @xcite and interpreted by @xcite and @xcite as internal acoustic waves trapped in spherical - shell cavities .",
    "wave motions are measured along the line of sight from the doppler shifts of absorption lines in the solar spectrum .",
    "a short review of solar oscillations is given in section  [ observations ] .",
    "helioseismology has produced a large number of discoveries in solar , stellar , and fundamental physics .",
    "it provides the most precise tests of the theory of stellar structure and evolution , for example it motivated a revision of the standard model of particle physics to solve the solar neutrino problem .",
    "helioseismology also enables the study and discovery of effects that are not included in standard solar models ( standard models are spherically symmetric , non rotating , non magnetic , and include a simplified treatment of convection ) .",
    "one of the most exciting aspects of helioseismology is the search for the origin of the sun s magnetic field , one of the most important unsolved problems in solar physics .",
    "the eleven - year solar magnetic cycle is thought to be due to a field - amplification ( dynamo- ) process ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereby a toroidal magnetic field component ( in the azimuthal direction with respect to the rotation axis ) is built up by stretching of the field lines by the sun s differential rotation . in a second step the toroidal field",
    "is partially converted into a poloidal field component , which closes the dynamo cycle .",
    "models for this second step ( ` @xmath5-effect ' ) differ significantly . in most models ,",
    "it is attributed to the effect of convection on the magnetic field ( convective dynamos ) . in an older model",
    "more closely connected with observations , convective flows play no role in this step ; it is instead due to the instability of the toroidal field itself .",
    "the instability causes loops of magnetic field to rise to the solar surface , and appear as the observed magnetic ( sunspot ) activity .",
    "resolution of this conflict between the models is key for progress towards a theory of stellar magnetic fields which has real predictive power .",
    "helioseismology holds the promise of providing new observational constraints on cycle - related structures below the surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "traditionally , helioseismology methods have been classified into two groups : global helioseismology and local helioseismology .",
    "global helioseismology consists of measuring the frequencies of the modes of oscillation and searching for seismic solar models whose oscillation frequencies match the observed ones ( see * ? ? ? * for a review of techniques and results ) .",
    "global helioseismology is two dimensional and is used to infer solar properties as functions of radius and unsigned latitude .",
    "a major achievement of global helioseismology is the inference of the angular velocity in the solar interior ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the differentially - rotating convection zone and the rigidly - rotating radiative interior are separated by a transition region at @xmath6 , the tachocline , which may be the seat of the solar dynamo .",
    "unlike standard global mode helioseismology , local helioseismology is capable of probing the solar interior in three dimensions .",
    "this is important for the study of solar activity , which is seen on the surface as localized patches of magnetic field , e.g. active regions , sunspots , and plage regions .",
    "local helioseismology can potentially be used to infer vector flows , thermal and structural inhomogeneities , and even the magnetic field itself .",
    "local helioseismology has been reviewed by e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "the most comprehensive review is provided by @xcite .",
    "local helioseismology encompasses various methods of data analysis ( section  [ sec.methods ] ) .",
    "one method of local helioseismology , ring diagram analysis , is a relatively straight - forward extension of global helioseismology .",
    "it consists of measuring local frequencies of oscillation by analyzing small patches on the sun .",
    "ring - diagram analysis is computationally efficient and has produced important results , such as maps of flow patterns in the sun .",
    "other methods of local helioseismology , like time - distance helioseismology and helioseismic holography , are based on the computation of the cross - covariance between the oscillation signal measured at two points on the surface .",
    "the basic principle is to retrieve information about the solar interior from the time it takes for solar waves to travel between any two surface locations through the solar interior .",
    "the cross - covariance function is directly related to the green s function and thus carries essential information .",
    "like in global helioseismology , an inverse problem must be solved in order to retrieve subsurface solar properties from local helioseismic measurements ( section  [ sec.forward_inverse ] ) . in many cases",
    "it is acceptable to assume that the sun is weakly heterogeneous in the horizontal directions : the inverse problem becomes a linear inverse problem and can be solved with standard techniques .",
    "however this is not always possible , especially in the presence of strong magnetic fields , e.g. in a sunspot .",
    "time - distance helioseismology aims at inferring subsurface properties at the best spatial and temporal resolution possible .",
    "a spatial resolution as small as a few mm can be achieved near the surface .",
    "this limit is intimately linked to the smallest available horizontal wavelength of the solar oscillations ( high frequency surface gravity waves ) .",
    "detailed 3d maps of vector flows in the upper convection zone have provided new insights into the structure , evolution and organization of magnetic active regions and convective flows .",
    "the most easily detectable flow pattern is supergranulation , an intermediate - scale of convection ( section  [ sec.superg ] ) .",
    "a particularly challenging aspect of local helioseismology is sunspot helioseismology ( section  [ sec.sunspots ] ) .",
    "sunspots are regions of intense ( kilogauss ) magnetic field and low gas pressure and density . in spite of an abundance of telling clues from observations of the solar surface , theories about their formation , subsurface structure , thermal properties , and deep magnetic field topology are still controversial .",
    "the nature of solar waves is very significantly altered as they propagate through a sunspot and convert into magneto - acoustic - gravity ( mag ) waves .",
    "numerical modeling of wave propagation through model sunspots is currently being developed by several groups .",
    "these simulations will be key to interpret the solar oscillations in the vicinity of sunspots .",
    "realistic numerical simulations also promise to be an important diagnostic tool for sunspot structure . the main question  what keeps a sunspot together as a clearly delineated entity",
    "? may not ultimately be answerable by helioseismology , since key elements of the answer may well lie in a region near the base of the convection zone , where helioseismological tools may not have enough sensitivity to detect a sunspot - related signal .",
    "they may perhaps be sufficient , however , to challenge models that propose the origin of sunspots to be in the surface layers .    among the most interesting results of local helioseismology",
    "is the detection of the subsurface meridional flow ( section  [ sec.global_scales ] ) .",
    "the meridional flow does not affect global mode frequencies ( to first order ) and thus has only been measured in the solar interior with local helioseismology .",
    "the meridional flow plays an important role in flux transport theories , according to which the latitudinal transport of magnetic flux at the base of the convection zone determines the period of the solar cycle .    in yet another remarkable application",
    ", local helioseismology can be used to construct maps of active regions on the far side of the sun ( section  [ sec.farside ] ) . in farside imaging , the sun as whole is used as an acoustic lens focussing waves at a point on the invisible hemisphere .",
    "maps of the farside are potentially important to predict space weather and provide advance warning for coronal mass ejections and solar flares ( violent and sudden release of energy associated with the reconfiguration of the magnetic field in the atmosphere above an active region ) .",
    "flares can excite acoustic waves to measurable levels , which can in turn tell us about the physics of flares ( section  [ sec.flares ] ) .",
    "these examples illustrate the many facets of the science possible with local helioseismology , as summarized in * figure  [ fig.overview]*. in all these cases a taste of the possibilities has been provided , but improved observations ( section  [ sec.future ] ) and further developments in the techniques of analysis and interpretation are required to realize the full potential of local helioseismology .",
    "in most cases , local helioseismology uses time - series of dopplergrams as input data .",
    "a dopplergram is a digitized image of the line - of - sight velocity of the solar surface ( photosphere or chromosphere ) deduced from the doppler shifts of a fraunhofer absorption line ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "solar oscillations have a higher signal - to - noise ratio in doppler velocity than in intensity , especially at low frequencies .",
    "there are two major data sets available for local helioseismology .",
    "the first one is provided by the global oscillation network group ( gong , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) headquartered in tucson , arizona , which operates a global network of six stations around the world .",
    "the sites are distributed in longitude in order to observe continuously : big bear ( california ) , mauna loa ( hawaii ) , learmonth ( australia ) , udaipur ( india ) , el teide ( canary islands ) , and cerro tololo ( chile ) .",
    "the cadence of the observations is one minute to avoid temporal aliasing .",
    "each gong instrument is a phase - shift interferometer that measures the phase of the fourier transform of the solar spectrum around the ni i absorption line at 6768   , interpreted as a doppler shift @xcite . while the original cameras had an image size of 256@xmath7256 pixels , full - disk dopplergrams",
    "have been recorded with 1024@xmath71024 cdd cameras since 2001 , hence providing a good spatial resolution ( @xmath8 arcsec ) for local helioseismology .",
    "the gong instruments also acquire intensity images and line - of - sight magnetograms .",
    "the effective duty cycle of the merged observations is over 90% .",
    "the other main data set is provided by the michelson doppler imager ( mdi , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) on - board the esa / nasa solar and heliospheric observatory ( soho ) , which was launched in december 1995 .",
    "soho is in a halo orbit around the sun - earth l1 lagrange point .",
    "observations from soho are not only continuous , but benefit from perfect seeing and from a slowly varying spacecraft - to - sun velocity .",
    "the mdi filter system relies on two tunable michelson interferometers in order to measure intensity in five very narrow filters ( 94  m ) in the wings and core of the ni  6768 line .",
    "the doppler velocity is obtained by taking the difference between filtergrams on each side of the absorption line .",
    "the mdi observables are the line depth and continuum , line - of - sight doppler velocity , and line - of - sight magnetic field .",
    "the temporal cadence is one minute and the ccd camera has 1024@xmath71024 pixels .",
    "it can operate in two different modes : a full - disk mode ( @xmath9 arcsec pixel ) or a high - resolution mode ( @xmath10  arcsec pixel ) .",
    "* figure  [ fig.observables ] * shows example full - disk soho / mdi observables and * supplemental movie 1 * shows a time series of full - disk dopplergrams . in high - resolution mode , the resolution is better by a factor of three but the field of view is reduced .",
    "because of limited telemetry , the full - disk dopplergrams have only been transmitted at full cadence for about two to three months each year since 1996 , while the high - resolution dopplergrams are reserved for targeted campaigns of observation . the rest of the time ,",
    "the dopplergrams are spatially filtered onboard and converted into lower - resolution @xmath11 images , in order to save telemetry ( medium - degree data ) .",

    "the oscillations have reduced amplitudes in the sunspot . ]",
    "gong and mdi are complemented by other data sets , e.g. from the taiwan oscillation network ( ton , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , from campaigns of observations at the south pole with the magneto - optical filter at two heights ( moth , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and from the hinode satellite ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in many applications of local helioseismology ,",
    "the standard procedure consists of choosing a relatively small region of the sun and following ( or ` tracking ' ) it in a frame that is co - rotating with the sun .",
    "this gives a time series of doppler images that are centered on the region of interest , like a magnetic active region . in this process each individual image is mapped onto a common spatial grid .    for local studies",
    "it is often convenient to neglect the curvature of the solar surface and work in plane - parallel geometry . with this simplification ,",
    "it is natural to study the oscillations in three - dimensional fourier space .",
    "the oscillation signal , denoted by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the horizontal position vector and @xmath15 is time , is decomposed into harmonic components @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the area of study , @xmath18 is the total observation time , the vector @xmath19 is the horizontal wavevector , and @xmath20 is the angular frequency .",
    "the horizontal wavenumber is @xmath21 . by convention ,",
    "the @xmath22 coordinate is positive in the direction of rotation ( prograde ) and the @xmath23 coordinate points north .",
    "the power spectrum of solar oscillations is defined as @xmath24 we note that the spatial fourier transform should be replaced by a spherical harmonic transform when curvature effects can not be ignored , as in global helioseismology .",
    "an example power spectrum of solar oscillations is shown in * figure  [ fig.power]*. power is distributed along well - defined discrete ridges in wavenumber - frequency space and peaks around 3  mhz .",
    "the first ridge at low frequencies shows the `` fundamental '' ( f ) modes .",
    "these are surface gravity waves with exponential eigenfunctions and a dispersion relation @xmath25 , where @xmath26  ms@xmath27is the acceleration of gravity at the solar surface ; they are similar to waves at the surface of a deep ocean .",
    "all other ridges correspond to pressure ( p ) modes , i.e. acoustic waves modified by gravity .",
    "the existence of discrete ridges , @xmath28 with @xmath29 , reflects the fact that p modes are trapped in the vertical direction . at fixed wavenumber",
    ", the peaks of power are labeled p@xmath30 , p@xmath31 , p@xmath32 , etc .  with increasing frequency .",
    "a mode p@xmath33 is such that the number of radial nodes of the mode displacement is @xmath34 ( the radial order ) . by convention",
    ", the f modes are labeled with @xmath35 .",
    "all ridges have reduced power above @xmath36  mhz , which is the cut - off frequency above which waves are not reflected back into the sun but escape into the atmosphere .",
    "the frequency width of a ridge is inversely proportional to the mode lifetime .",
    "a recent description of the mode parameters , including mode lifetimes , is provided by @xcite .     through an average power spectrum of mdi / soho high - resolution doppler velocity data as a function of frequency and @xmath37 .",
    "the horizontal dashed line shows the acoustic cutoff frequency . in order to reduce random noise ,",
    "an average was carried out over eight individual power spectra , each of duration @xmath38  hr and covering an apodized region of area @xmath39 . since @xmath40 , only waves traveling in the east or west directions are showed .",
    "the power below @xmath41  mhz is due to solar convection , granulation and supergranulation . ]      in order to better understand the diagnostic capability of each mode , it is useful to consider simple solar models . for our purpose ,",
    "a simple solar model is a reference standard solar model , which only depends on height ( or radius ) , such as model s @xcite . in plane - parallel models that are isotropic and translation invariant in the horizontal directions ,",
    "the normal modes of the oscillations of the model vary horizontally as @xmath42 . for the case of p and f modes , it is convenient to introduce the mode eigenfunctions @xmath43 and @xmath44 such that the complex displacement eigenfunction of the mode characterized by radial order @xmath34 and horizontal wavevector @xmath45 is @xmath46 e^{i { { \\bf k}}\\cdot{{\\bf r } } } , \\ ] ] where @xmath47 is height , @xmath48 is the unit vector pointing upwards , and @xmath49 is the horizontal unit vector pointing in the direction of @xmath45 .",
    "zero height corresponds to the photosphere ( @xmath50 is depth ) .",
    "the representation of the displacement eigenfunctions in terms of only the two functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 is possible as neither the f nor the p modes have horizontal motions that are perpendicular to @xmath45 . as a result of the assumed isotropy ,",
    "the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 do not depend on the direction of @xmath45 and the mode frequencies @xmath53 only depend on wavenumber .",
    "the time evolution of the mode @xmath54 is given by @xmath55 $ ] . in models that include attenuation , the frequencies are complex , while they are real for the case of adiabatic oscillations and standard boundary conditions .",
    "* figure  [ fig.eigenfunctions ] * shows the horizontal and vertical eigenfunctions corresponding to the first five radial orders at a frequency of @xmath56  mhz .",
    "the solar model for this case is a plane - parallel version of model  s. the eigenfunctions are scaled by @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the density ( left - most panel ) .",
    "this scaling is used as we are interested in the kinetic energy density of the modes , @xmath59 , which is a physically relevant quantity . for the f mode",
    "the horizontal and vertical displacement eigenfunctions are equal . for the acoustic modes ( @xmath29 ) , the lower turning point , @xmath60 ,",
    "is the height at which the sound speed is equal to the horizontal phase speed of the mode : @xmath61 ( neglecting the buoyancy frequency and the acoustic cutoff frequency , both of which are very small below a few  mm beneath the photosphere ) .",
    "thus all the modes with a similar horizontal phase speed ( a straight line through the origin in * figure  [ fig.power ] * ) have a similar lower turning point and probe essentially the same layers of the sun .     and @xmath52 for the radials order @xmath35@xmath62 ( other panels ) at the frequency @xmath56  mhz . the lower turning points of the modes @xmath63@xmath62 are shown as thin horizontal black lines .",
    "at fixed frequency , the horizontal phase speed @xmath64 increases with increasing radial order @xmath34 , and therefore lower turning points increase with increasing @xmath34 as well . the functions @xmath51 and @xmath52 have been scaled with @xmath57 as the kinetic energy density is proportional to @xmath65 . ]",
    "in this section we give an overview of the various methods of local helioseismology . for an in - depth description of each method see e.g.  @xcite and references therein .      the first operation in ring diagram analysis is to cover some fraction of the visible solar disk with patches ( overlapping or not ) with circular areas with diameters in the range @xmath66@xmath67 .",
    "each patch is tracked in longitude with a velocity close to the solar surface rotation velocity to produce a time series of helioseismic observations ( dopplergrams or intensity images ) . for each patch a three - dimensional local power spectrum of the solar oscillation , @xmath68 ,",
    "is computed according to equations  [ eq.fft ] and  [ eq.power ] .",
    "the local power spectra reflect the local physical conditions in the solar interior , such as wave speed and horizontal flows @xcite .",
    "for example , a constant horizontal flow @xmath69 will introduce a doppler shift of the power spectrum : @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the power spectrum in the absence of a flow .",
    "this description is highly simplified as flows in the sun do vary with horizontal position and depth . a change in the structure of the solar interior produces a change in the dispersion relation that does not depend on the direction of @xmath45 , and thus a change in the power spectrum that is also independent of the direction of @xmath45 .",
    "there are two ways to study local power spectra .",
    "the first approach is to consider cuts at constant frequency , @xmath20 . in @xmath72",
    "space , wave power is concentrated in rings , each corresponding to a different radial order @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "a ring diagram is shown in * figure  [ fig.frankring]*. when there is no flow , the radius of each ring is the wavenumber @xmath73 at which @xmath74 and is sensitive to the local dispersion relation .",
    "thus the ring radius is related to the local wave speed under the patch . as shown above",
    ", a flow will affect the local power spectrum .",
    "linearizing equation  [ eq.pring ] for small @xmath75 , we find that the change in the ring position is @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the group speed .",
    "hence the flow amplitude and direction can be estimated from the distortion and orientation of the distorted rings .",
    "note that the distortion of a ring depends on radial order in the case of a depth - varying flow .",
    "mhz ( _ left _ , ring diagram ) and at constant wavenumber @xmath78  rad / mm ( _ right _ ) for the case of a depth - independent horizontal flow @xmath69 with an amplitude of 1  km / s and in the direction @xmath79 that is thirty degrees north of the prograde direction . in the left panel ,",
    "the black arrow shows the direction of the flow .",
    "the different rings correspond to different radial orders ; the outermost ring is the f mode .",
    "the rings with large @xmath73 are more strongly influenced by the flow than those with small @xmath73 ( see text ) . in the right panel ,",
    "the ridge frequencies show a sinusoidal variation with @xmath80 and reach their maxima when @xmath81 ( shown by the vertical black line ) . the frequency variation with @xmath80",
    "is the same for all of the ridges as as the flow is independent of depth . ]",
    "the second approach consists of considering cuts at constant wavenumber , @xmath73 , through the power spectra @xcite .",
    "the local power spectra are then studied in @xmath82 space , where @xmath80 is the azimuth of the wave vector measured from the prograde direction , @xmath83 .",
    "the modes appear as bands of power around the resonant frequencies @xmath53 .",
    "according to equation  [ eq.pring ] , a constant horizontal flow will doppler shift the mode frequencies by @xmath84 . as a result",
    ", @xmath69 can be estimated from the frequency shifts at each @xmath73 and radial order @xmath34 . a change in the wave speed",
    "will simply manifest itself as a change in the wave frequencies that is independent of @xmath80 and can be disentangled from the effect of a horizontal flow .    both approaches",
    "rely on fitting a parametric model of the power spectrum to the observed local power spectra .",
    "several functional forms have been proposed to fit the observations .",
    "the most important fitted parameters are the mode frequencies , @xmath85 , and the two flow parameters , @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "there is one set of parameters for each wavenumber and radial order .",
    "details about the fitting procedures are given by , e.g. , @xcite for the first approach and , e.g. , @xcite for the second approach .",
    "the fitted parameters are sensitive to the conditions in the solar interior , with a depth sensitivity that depends on the eigenfunction of the mode ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "for example , the depth sensitivity to a horizontal flow is approximately given by the kinetic energy density of the mode ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the larger the horizontal phase speed of the mode , the deeper the sensitivity .",
    "thus large patches give access to deeper regions in the sun than small patches .",
    "the differences between the fitted mode frequencies , @xmath88 , and the mode frequencies calculated from a standard solar model , @xmath53 , are used in one dimensional ( depth ) inversions to infer structural conditions under each patch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "two independent structural quantities can be inverted at a time , e.g. , sound speed and density , from which other quantities can be inferred , such as the first adiabatic exponent .",
    "similarly , the depth dependence of the horizontal flows , @xmath89 and @xmath90 , can be inferred from a set of fitted parameters @xmath91 and @xmath92 @xcite .",
    "typically , ring analysis is used to probe the top 30  mm of the convection zone , with a maximum horizontal resolution of about @xmath66 near the surface .",
    "three - dimensional maps can then be obtained by combining neighboring patches .",
    "time - distance helioseismology is based on the measurement of the cross - covariance between the doppler signals at two points @xmath93 and @xmath94 on the solar surface , @xmath95 where @xmath15 is the correlation time - lag .",
    "* figure  [ fig.ray_paths]*@xmath96 shows a cross - covariance function measured from 144  days of mdi medium - degree data .",
    "the cross - covariance has been averaged over many pairs of points @xmath97 and is presented as a function of the heliocentric angle between these two points .",
    "this diagram is known as the `` time - distance diagram . ''",
    "the cross - covariance is essentially a phase coherent average of the random oscillations @xcite .",
    "it is a solar seismogram : it provides a way to measure wave travel times between two surface locations .    a particular wave packet ( consisting of set of modes with similar phase speeds ) is preferentially selected for each travel distance .",
    "many applications involve much less temporal and spatial averaging than was used in this figure .",

    "the wavelength is treated as if it were much smaller than the length scales associated with the variations in the background solar model .",

    "downward propagating rays are refracted by the increase of the sound speed with depth until they reach their lower turning where the horizontal phase speed matches the sound speed . at frequencies below about @xmath36  mhz , upwards propagating rays are reflected from the solar surface by the sharp rise in the acoustic cutoff frequency . at higher frequencies ,",
    "the waves escape into the solar atmosphere .",
    "the main features in the time - distance diagram ( * figure  [ fig.ray_paths]*@xmath96 ) are the ridges which correspond to different paths that wave energy takes between pairs of observation points .",
    "for example , the blue line corresponds to `` first - bounce '' arrivals ( i.e. , waves that visit their lower turning points once between the two observation points ) .",
    "the fine structure of the ridges in the time - difference diagram reflects the band - limited nature of the power spectrum .",
    "the majority of the wave power is near 3  mhz and as a result the cross - covariance shows fine structure that has a period of about 5  min .",

    "thus the cross - covariance is sensitive to the wave propagation conditions ( structure and flows ) between the two surface points @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the sensitivity of the cross - covariance to any particular local change in the solar interior is a non - trivial research topic , because the local wavelength of solar oscillations is not necessarily small compared to the length scales of the heterogenities in the sun .",
    "in addition , this sensitivity depends strongly on the combination of waves that contribute to the cross - covariance function .",
    "this will be discussed in section  [ sec.forward_inverse ] .    for the sake of simplicity , consider a constant horizontal flow @xmath69 . according to equations  [ eq.cpow ] and  [ eq.pring ] , the effect of such a flow",

    "thus a flow will break the symmetry between the @xmath106 and @xmath107 parts of the cross - covariance .",
    "in contrast , a horizontally uniform change in , e.g. , sound speed would introduce a time - symmetric change in the cross - covariance .",
    "several techniques have been proposed to measure travel times from the cross - covariance .",

    "the difference between inward and outward travel times is sensitive to the horizontal divergence of the local flow or to a local vertical flow , while the average travel time is sensitive to the local wave speed .",
    "similarly , the covariance between a point and a north quadrant is used to study waves that propagate either northward or southward .",
    "the various combinations of travel times are shown in * figure  [ fig.tt ] * for annulus radii ranging from @xmath108  mm to @xmath109  mm .",

    "the average magnetogram and the average dopplergram are shown in the right most column .",
    "the travel - time perturbations are mostly due to the supergranular scale horizontal flows . ]    finally , the travel - time maps must be inverted ( the inverse problem ) .",

    "one of the main characteristics of direct modeling , as its name suggests , is that it does not produce any intermediate data products ( e.g. no travel time map ) as the inversions are carried out directly on the correlations .",

    "one complication for models that invoke thermal forcing at the surface is to explain the presence of the torsional oscillations at solar minimum @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the model of @xcite does not require enhanced thermal forcing at high latitudes ( @xmath222 ) to explain the poleward - propagating branch of the torsional oscillations .",
    "the two branches of the zonal torsional oscillations may have different physical origins .",
    "an interesting question is whether the localized flows around active regions ( section  [ sec.ssw ] ) contribute significantly to the solar - cycle variation of the longitudinal averages of the differential rotation and the meridional flow .",
    "the inflows / outflows around active regions could affect the average meridional circulation around the mean latitude of activity , while the vortical component of the flows could affect the average zonal flows .    in order to study this question ,",
    "@xcite selected all regions within @xmath223 of all locations with strong magnetic field and excluded these regions from the longitudinal averages of the flows .",
    "the zonal flows are essentially unaffected ( except for the fact that active regions rotate a little more rapidly than quiet sun ) : localized cyclonic flows around large active regions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the torsional oscillations .",
    "this is not particularly surprising since torsional oscillations exist at solar minimum , in the absence of active regions .",
    "the torsional oscillations model of @xcite would have to rely on the thermal disturbances caused by diffuse small - scale magnetic fields , not localized active regions . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite finds that the inflows around active regions appear to be largely responsible for the near - surface solar - cycle dependence of the meridional flow , at the level of a few ms@xmath1 .",
    "this conclusion has been challenged however by @xcite , which indicates that the answer depends sensitively on the selection of the regions of activity that are removed from the longitudinal averages .",
    "@xcite introduced the concept of farside imaging , in which observations of the solar oscillations made on the visible disk are used to infer the presence of active regions on the farside of the sun .",
    "farside imaging has been achieved using both holography - based methods ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and time - distance helioseismology @xcite .",

    "in addition to dopplergrams , hmi will provide images of the three components of the vector magnetic field , providing important information for the interpretation of helioseismic data .",
    "a stated goal of hmi / sdo is the subsurface detection of the magnetic field before it emerges at the surface , leading to reliable predictive capability @xcite . in combination with observations from the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ) , a set of four sdo telescopes designed to provide an unprecedented view of the lower corona , hmi and local helioseismology will help establish relationships between the internal structure and dynamics of the sun and the various components of magnetic activity in the solar atmosphere .",

    "in addition to approximations in the data interpretation , it is important to keep in mind that several sources instrumental errors can affect the measurements , e.g. , plate scale errors and optical distortion @xcite or uncertainties in the orientation of the image @xcite .",
    "( 100,100 )    an important challenge for future work in local helioseismology is to detect signatures of magnetic fields at the base of the convection zone , where the field is expected to be amplified by differential rotation and stored until erupting to the surface as active regions .",
    "direct detection through their effect on wave propagation properties is unlikely .",
    "because of the high pressure at the base of the convection zone , the contrast in propagation speed is very much lower than in surface structures like sunspots , even at the inferred field strengths of @xmath229 g . more promising is the prospect of detecting systematic flows that might be associated with magnetic structures at the base of the convection zone . easiest to detect",
    "would be azimuthal flows ( variations in rotation rate ) , such as have already been reported on the time scale of the solar cycle .",
    "even if the sensitivity of helioseismic methods turns out insufficient to detect such deeply seated structures , it may well be sufficient to rule out certain less - preferred classes of models for the solar cycle , such as convective dynamo models acting throughout the convection zone or in a shallow surface layer .",
    "an important class of flows would be the geostrophic flows caused by thermal effects of magnetic fields ( see section  [ sec.ssw ] ) .",

    "this is illustrated by the fact that the standard methods of analysis yield conflicting inferences regarding sunspot structure and dynamics ( see e.g. * figure  [ fig.compare_wave_speed ] * ) .",
