    "<S> let the operator of a rotation about an axis @xmath91 by an angle @xmath92 be denoted as @xmath93 . </S>",

    "<S> _ when the three particles turn out to form an ist ( including the rt as a special case ) with the symmetric axis @xmath101 lying on the @xmath102-@xmath61 plane , we have the equivalence @xmath103 , where @xmath104 denotes the interchange of the two particles at the bottom of the ist . </S>",
    "<S> it leads to @xmath105 , where @xmath106 is the angle between @xmath101 and @xmath61 , and @xmath107 depends on the statistics . </S>",

    "<S> since all the three bonds can be optimized in a rt , the rt - accessible ( rt - ac ) components are much favored by the lower states . among the nine states under consideration </S>",
    "<S> , the rt - ac components can be contained in the @xmath54 , @xmath50 , @xmath55 , @xmath48 and @xmath56 states . </S>",
    "<S> they are called the rt - ac states and are dominated by the rt - ac component with @xmath112 ( 3 ) if @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) ( as shown in table 1 ) , thereby their energies can be much lower and they constitute the lowest group in the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> their wave functions are distributed surrounding a rt resulting in having a smaller size . </S>",
    "<S> the domination of the rt - ac component explains why @xmath115 or @xmath116 is particularly large in the rt - ac states .    for @xmath46 , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath117 component is prohibited by `` rule 1 '' , while in the @xmath84 component the ist is prohibited by `` rule 3 '' . </S>",
    "<S> the prohibition of all the ist causes serious consequence . </S>",
    "<S> it implies that the wave function is expelled from the important zones of coordinate space ( see below ) resulting in having a very high energy and a large size . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why this state belongs to the highest group in the spectra .    for @xmath118 and @xmath49 , only @xmath117 </S>",
    "<S> is allowed due to `` rule 1 '' . </S>",
    "<S> this component is ist - ac but rt - inaccessible ( rt - inac ) . </S>",

    "<S> components are allowed . due to `` rule 3 '' , </S>",
    "<S> the former is ist - inac and therefore extremely unfavorable . </S>",
    "<S> thus the weights are greatly concentrated in @xmath120 as shown in table 1 . since the @xmath121 component is also ist - ac and rt - inac , @xmath122 belongs also to the second group .    </S>",
    "<S> since _ the classification _ is based on the accessibility of the rt and ist originating from symmetry constraint , it _ is universal for all kinds of 3-boson systems_.      since the weights @xmath87 are related to the relative orientation between @xmath57 and @xmath20 , these weights are related to the one - body densities @xmath123 which is an observable . </S>",
    "<S> let us go back to the fixed - frame and deal with the eigenstates @xmath124 . from the normality </S>",
    "<S> , we have @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the position vector of the third particle relative to the c.m . , </S>",
    "<S> and @xmath127 is the probability density of finding a particle ( disregarding which one ) at @xmath128 . </S>",

    "<S> the @xmath123 extracted from @xmath130 is plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . for @xmath48 , since this state is dominated by @xmath116 , @xmath57 is essentially lying along @xmath20 ( i.e. , along the @xmath41-axis at the choice @xmath129 ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is expected that the @xmath123 of @xmath48 would be distributed close to the x - y plane . </S>",
    "<S> this presumption is confirmed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . for @xmath56 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath116 is also dominant , thus the direction of @xmath20 is close to but deviates a little from the z - axis . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the peak of @xmath123 of @xmath56 is close to but deviates from @xmath131 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 is dominated by @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , the peak is farther apart from @xmath133 . whereas @xmath50 is dominated by @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath57 is essentially vertical to the @xmath41-axis , thus the plane of the particles prefer to be coplanar with the z - axis if @xmath134 , and the distribution is no more close to the equator . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the @xmath123 of @xmath50 is peaked at @xmath135 .    </S>",
    "<S> although fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] is from @xmath86 , the feature is common for various 3-boson systems . for examples , when @xmath86 , @xmath89 , and @xmath38 are used , the @xmath123 of @xmath56 is peaked at @xmath136 , @xmath136 , and @xmath137 , respectively , and the @xmath123 of @xmath47 is peaked at @xmath138 , @xmath139 , and @xmath139 .      </S>",
    "<S> let us study the structures of the states in more detail in the body - frame . </S>",
    "<S> we define the hyper - radius @xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> this quantity is invariant under the transformation between different sets of jacobi coordinates . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is suitable to describe the size . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we define @xmath141 . when @xmath142 and @xmath143 are replaced by @xmath144 and @xmath145 as arguments , eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ e02_1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath146 where @xmath147 is an infinitesimal deformation , and @xmath148 is the probability density that the system has a given size and a given shape ( while an integration over the orientation of the shape has already been carried out ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore @xmath149 is called the shape - density which relates directly to the structure .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath150 be the azimuthal angle of @xmath151 lying on the @xmath102-@xmath61 plane . since @xmath73 is given lying along @xmath61 , @xmath152 . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath144 be given at @xmath153 ( let @xmath154 be the distance of the @xmath5-th particle from the c.m .. then @xmath155 , and the average @xmath156 ) . </S>",
    "<S> examples of @xmath157 as a function of @xmath150 and @xmath158 are given below . </S>",
    "<S> the geometry associated with the arguments @xmath159 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath86 is used , the @xmath157 of the rt - ac first - states are very similar with each other ( except @xmath55 ) as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5]a and [ fig5]b . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath157 of @xmath55 is shown in [ fig5]c . </S>",
    "<S> all of them are peaked at @xmath160 associated with a rt as expected . in 5c </S>",
    "<S> the peak is extended along three directions each leading to a col . </S>",
    "<S> all the three rt - inac and ist - ac first - states are similar as shown in [ fig5]d , where a node appears at the rt and the three peaks are all associated with a flattened ist with particles 3 , 1 , and 2 at the top , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the top angles of the ist are @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 , respectively for @xmath47 , @xmath118 , and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath157 of the ist - inac state @xmath46 is shown in [ fig5]f , where a number of nodal lines exist in the @xmath164 subspace , and the wave functions are expelled and compressed into six separate regions . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of so many nodal lines implies the existence of a very strong inherent oscillation . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why @xmath46 is very high in energy . from the different patterns of the @xmath157 , we know that the classification based on the accessibility of geometries is valid .    </S>",
    "<S> for a col , let @xmath57 be set along the line of particles , then the rotation about @xmath57 by any angle causes nothing . </S>",
    "<S> hence the col exists only in the @xmath84 component ( it implies that @xmath20 is essentially vertical to @xmath57 ) . besides , a rotation about @xmath61 by @xmath94 is equivalent to an inversion . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to @xmath165 . </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , only the states with @xmath166 are allowed to have the col . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , for a symmetric col , an inversion is equivalent to an interchange of the two particles at the ends . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the symmetric col exists only in positive parity states ( for bosons ) . </S>",
    "<S> when a col is accessible but the symmetric col is not , the col is not stable because an inherent node is contained and a linear oscillation is inherently excited . on the other hand , from pure dynamics , a col will have a larger moment of inertia . comparing with the rt </S>",
    "<S> , a col will have a higher interaction energy but a smaller rotation energy . </S>",
    "<S> hence , this structure will be preferred by the states with a larger @xmath20 so that the rotation energy can be considerably reduced . with this analysis , among the nine states , obviously , the col will be more preferred by @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> this explains the extension found in [ fig5]c , but not in [ fig5]a and [ fig5]b . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that the col will definitely appear in @xmath167 states as shown in [ fig5]e for @xmath168 , where the most probable shape is a symmetric col . </S>",
    "<S> incidentally , @xmath46 as shown in 5f is not only ist - inac but also col - inac , this explains why so many nodal lines emerge .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath89 is used , the qualitative features of fig .  [ fig5 ] remain unchanged . </S>",
    "<S> note that all the first states will do their best to pursue a structure favorable in binding and free from the symmetry constraint . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the similarity . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath38 is used , the total potential energy is not sensitive to the details of geometry because the interaction does not contain a minimum . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the pursuit to a better geometry is less anxious . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in [ fig6]a ( comparing with [ fig5]d , the ist is no more well kept ) and in [ fig6]b ( where the distribution extends towards the col . </S>",
    "<S> this tendency is not explicit in @xmath169 if @xmath86 or @xmath89 is used ) .      for fermion systems , </S>",

    "<S> we know that @xmath48 has its rt lying on the @xmath173-@xmath174 plane , while the rt of @xmath47 is upstanding . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore @xmath48 is symmetric - col - ac , while @xmath47 is not . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why @xmath48 is lower than @xmath47 even though they belong to the same group . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the ist in @xmath50 is lying , that in @xmath49 is not ( due to the prohibition of @xmath175 even component ) . </S>",
    "<S> besides , @xmath50 is col - ac while @xmath49 is not . </S>",
    "<S> this explains why @xmath50 is lower than @xmath49 even though they belong to the same group .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig6]c is similar to [ fig5]f where the wave function is absolutely expelled from the lines of ist . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath54 of fermions is col - ac ( but symmetric col - inac ) while @xmath46 of bosons is not . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , under the same interaction the @xmath54 of fermions is lower ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , and its most probable shape is a non - symmetric col with an inherent strong linear oscillation ( due to the nodal lines ) . comparing fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig6]d and [ fig5]c ( both for @xmath55 but for fermions and bosons , respectively ) , the wave function of the former is expelled from the rt and also from the symmetric col , while the latter is attracted by the col . </S>",
    "<S> thus the former is higher .      in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> the features of the tightly bound 3-boson states have been studied systematically . </S>",
    "<S> the universal existence of inherent nodal structures has been demonstrated analytically and numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the existence is irrelevant to the strength of the trap . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum states belonging to the same set of representations of the symmetry groups are constrained in the same way disregarding the kind of particles . </S>",
    "<S> since the constraint arising from symmetry is absolutely not violable , the effect of symmetry overtakes dynamics and is decisive . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> there are prohibited zones ( points , lines , ... ) in the coordinate space not accessible to specific states . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the establishment of a universal classification scheme based on the accessibility of rt , ist , and col , and leads to the extensive similarity among different systems . </S>",
    "<S> although this paper is essentially dedicated to boson systems , universality exists also in fermions systems due to the decisive role of symmetry constraint .    </S>",
