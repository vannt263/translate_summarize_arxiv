    "the current - voltage response of fabricated micro - nanochannel devices and ion - selective membranes are in many respects similar . both exhibit ion - selective transport and produce concentration polarization ( cp ) in adjacent solution resulting in a near limiting saturation of the dc current response . at sufficiently high voltages ,",
    "both exhibit an over - limiting current ( olc ) which may be associated with electro - convective vortices  @xcite among other mechanisms  @xcite . however , there are a number of differences between ion - selective membranes , such as nafion , and fabricated nanochannel devices .",
    "the geometry of pores within a membrane are often irregularly shaped , highly tortuous , and poorly connected  @xcite , and the fixed charge density quite high .",
    "one critical difference is that , while membranes such as nafion typically exhibit near ideal selectivity across a wide range of parameters  @xcite , nanochannel selectivity can vary appreciably .",
    "the similarity between membranes and nanochannels implies that a non - ideal membrane model can serve as a simple model for electro - diffusive transport through a nanochannel .",

    "we demonstrate the necessity of including these terms in capturing the effects of changing selectivity on the resistance maximum .",
    "this is expected to have consequences for the observability of the resistance maximum in real systems , where other olc mechanisms can enhance or compete with the esc driven resistance maximum  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it may have implications for the control of selectivity and esc structure in practical applications , such as bio - molecular sensing , analyte pre - concentration , or electrokinetic desalination .",
    "in the following , we consider one - dimensional steady - state electro - diffusive transport of a symmetric , binary electrolyte through a system consisting of two solution layers flanking a non - ideally cation - selective membrane ( see fig .

    "the cases in figs  [ fig : f4]b and c bear some relationship to the effects of field - focusing in the sense that increased field - focusing corresponds to both increasing flux density in the focused region and effective shortening of the diffusion length  @xcite . for different diffusion lengths @xmath70 , the total change in selectivity across the range of salt flux density , from @xmath71 to @xmath72 , is the same for all @xmath70 .",
    "however , the overall selectivity itself decreases with increasing @xmath70 because the concentration at the enriched boundary is higher for the same salt flux density .",

    "the change in selectivity itself does not require an accurate value of the concentration in the esc ; similar change would be obtained by simply equating the over - limiting concentration to zero .",
    "however , the very existence of the maximum itself arises from the fact that not only is the concentration non - zero , but increases with current beyond the limiting value ( see eqn .",
    "[ eqn : e17 ] ) . the basic mechanism behind the maximum may be understood as follows : initially , the increase in the extent of the depleted region , as indicated by @xmath36 , causes a rapid increase in the esc resistance . however , as the esc concentration increases , the effective conductivity of the depleted region increases both within the esc and at the edge of the quasi - electro - neutral region , giving rise to the maximum . +    , @xmath67 , and @xmath10 .",

    "[ fig : f4]a , changes little with applied voltage .",
    "the co - ion concentration inside the charge - selective region remains low and the counter - ion concentration is governed primarily by the value of @xmath69 itself .",
    "thus @xmath52 remains very close to the ideal value , @xmath73 for all voltages and the esc concentration increases slowly with voltage , being governed primarily by the slow increase of @xmath74 .",

    "for smaller values of @xmath69 , the change in @xmath52 ( equivalently , the ratio @xmath75 ) is larger , resulting in increasing @xmath52 faster than the decrease in @xmath48 . hence there is a larger increase in the esc concentration and lower resistance occurring at a lower voltage for smaller @xmath69 .",
    "+ the dependence of the resistance - voltage curve on diffusion length @xmath70 is more indicative of the changes in the limiting salt flux density and in the enriched concentration than the increased resistance of the longer diffusion layers .",

    "[ fig : f4 ] ) , corresponding to a smaller increase in esc concentration for a given change in total applied voltage .",
    "thus it takes a larger overall voltage to reach the resistance maximum .",
    "the reasoning for changing diffusivity is somewhat similar in the sense that higher effective salt flux in the membrane for smaller values of @xmath10 corresponds to an overall higher selectivity , hence lower co - ion concentration and flux .",
    "however , because it does not correspond to an actual modification of the concentrations or electric potentials adjacent to the membrane , the voltage does not shift . +     here does not correspond directly to that in the 1d model.,title=\"fig:\",width=3 ] +    to gain some insight into the influence of field - focusing on the structure of the esc , selectivity variation , and dc response , a 2d numerical solution for the pnp equations is obtained using comsol .",
