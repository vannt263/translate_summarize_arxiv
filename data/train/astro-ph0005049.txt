    "recent theoretical research on the low column density ( @xmath3 ) lyman - alpha ( ly@xmath4 ) forest at redshifts @xmath5 points towards a picture in which the forest consists largely of mildly nonlinear fluctuations of a smooth intergalactic medium ( e.g. ; see for a review and further ref . ) .",
    "this provides the motivation to analyze the quasar ( qso ) absorption spectrum as a continuous field with fluctuations , rather than as a collection of discrete absorption lines .",
    "the two - point correlation or its fourier transform , the power spectrum , comes to mind as a useful and common statistic used in other areas such as the microwave background or galaxy large - scale - structure .",
    "indeed , its application to qso spectrum has been discussed by a number of authors ( ) .",
    "recently , croft et al .",
    "@xcite ( see also ) have shown that the mass power spectrum can be recovered from the qso transmission power spectrum , from which one could further deduce cosmological parameters such as @xmath6 ( ) . there exist at present a large number of high quality qso spectra ( e.g. ) which makes this an exciting field of research .",
    "upcoming quasar surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) and the anglo - australian telescope two degree field ( aat2df ) will enlarge the database significantly .    here",
    "we take the view that the qso transmission power spectrum / correlation is interesting in its own right , and focus on how to best measure it from the observed qso spectra , independent of the underlying physical picture of the forest .",
    "the two major questions are : ( 1 ) what are the main sources of systematic errors and what are the best ways to bring them under control ? ( 2 ) how to estimate the shot - noise , and to best combine data with different signal - to - noise ( random errors ) ?",
    "let us start by defining the transmission power spectrum and correlation function .",
    "two possibilities arise .",
    "one of them we call the un - normalized power spectrum @xmath7 / two - point correlation @xmath8 ( weinberg 1998 , private communication ; ): @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the transmission defined by @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the optical depth ( the absorption is then @xmath13 ) , @xmath14 or @xmath15 is the observed velocity ( or redshift or wavelength ) along a line of sight , and @xmath16 is its fourier counterpart .",
    "the angular brackets denote ensemble averaging .",
    "the other we call the normalized power spectrum @xmath17 / two - point correlation @xmath18 ( e.g. ): @xmath19 where @xmath20 , with @xmath21 being the mean transmission @xmath22 .",
    "we will almost exclusively focus on the latter , but will discuss at some point the pros and cons of the two , especially with regard to systematic errors . unless otherwise stated , hereafter , power spectrum / correlation refers to the normalized version .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ overview ] , we provide a brief overview of how the raw data output ( a two - dimensional ccd image ) is reduced to a one - dimensional qso spectrum .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath10 above is never observed directly .",
    "it is important to have a description of how the whole data reduction procedure works , which is sometimes hard to find in the literature .",
    "we give some illustrations by showing simulated spectra with various realistic levels of noise .    in  [ estimating ] , we discuss the estimation of the power spectrum and two - point correlation , beginning with the introduction of the quadratic estimator in  [ estimator ] . an important point pertaining to the estimation of the two - point correlation is raised here  most estimators employed in the literature are not optimal ; an alternative is given here which is an analogue of the landy - szalay estimator ( ) introduced originally for galaxy surveys . aside from this point , we focus exclusively on the estimation of the power spectrum . in  [ systematics ] , we discuss three sources of systematic errors : continuum - fitting , gaps and metal absorption lines .",
    "particular attention is paid to issues related to continuum - fitting .",
    "we advocate in  [ continuum ] trend - removal to replace traditional continuum - fitting , which avoids the latter s pitfalls .",
    "we further propose in  [ beyond ] that the power spectrum of the continuum can be estimated using trend - removal as well , which offers us a way to measure accurately the transmission power spectrum on large scales where the continuum fluctuations might be important . in ",
    "[ gaps ] , we discuss the effects of gaps and un - removed metal lines .",
    "we then turn our attention in  [ random ] to random errors .",
    "we emphasize here that the shot noise is not exactly poisson distributed because of the particular way the data is reduced .",
    "we point out the importance of subtracting the shot - noise - bias correctly , and describe a systematic way of assigning error - bars to the power spectrum , and introduce minimum - variance - weighting techniques to combine data of different qualities .",
    "some results here are stated without justification .",
    "the aim in this section is to summarize useful results for readers who might not be interested in details of the derivations , which are provided in the appendices .",
    "the techniques used in the appendices should be of broad interest e.g. the issue of generally non - poissonian shot - noise might be relevant for galaxy power spectrum estimation .",
    "lastly , we conclude in  [ conclude ] . we summarize here our recipe for transmission power estimation  readers who would like a quick overview of our methods can skip directly to this section , and only refer back to the relevant sections to fill in the details .",
    "we give general advice on observing strategies , and discuss in particular analysis issues relevant for the sloan digital sky survey .",
    "before we begin , let us first make a few clarifying remarks about some of our notation and terminology .",
    "in this paper , we refer to two different kinds of fluctuations which should be clearly distinguished .",
    "take the observed photon ( or electron ) count from a quasar as an example , @xmath23 .",
    "as one moves along a spectrum , the photon count fluctuates because of two very different reasons .",
    "first , it fluctuates because the universe is intrinsically inhomogeneous , giving rise to non - uniform absorption  we will refer to these as cosmic fluctuations .",
    "second , it fluctuates because the observed photon count is a discrete realization of the underlying cosmic signal  poisson fluctuation is the canonical example but not the only possible one , we will refer to these as discrete fluctuations .",
    "we define two different kind of averages corresponding to these two different kind of fluctuations .",
    "the discrete average of the observed photon count is denoted by @xmath24 . in other words",
    ", @xmath23 constitutes a discrete realization of the underlying cosmic signal @xmath25 .",
    "this signal @xmath26 itself suffers from cosmic fluctuations , and we will denote its ensemble average by @xmath27 .",
    "a fixed quasar continuum is assumed in this ensemble average i.e. it is the fluctuation in the spectrum caused by intervening absorption that constitutes the cosmic signal we are after .",
    "finally , we will sometimes use @xmath28 to implicitly stand for @xmath29 e.g. @xmath30 actually means @xmath31 which is the same as @xmath27 : in  [ beyond ] , we use @xmath28 to include averaging over an ensemble of different continua , and in  [ random ] we use @xmath32 to denote averaging over a shell of fourier modes . ]    to recap :    * @xmath23 is the directly observed quasar photon count . *",
    "@xmath33 refers to the idealized quasar photon count if one has infinite signal - to - noise ( s / n ) .",
    "* @xmath34 refers to the quasar photon count if one has infinite s / n _ and _ if one averages over all possible cosmic fluctuations keeping the continuum fixed e.g. by taking the same quasar and putting it at all possible orientations in the sky .",
    "for instance , if @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the true continuum and @xmath12 is the optical depth , then @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mean transmission .",
    "note that , when we use the term discrete , it is not implied that @xmath23 is necessarily an integer , although it is derived from some integral quantity such as the electron / photon count .",
    "we use the term discrete fluctuations instead of the usual poisson fluctuations , because as we will see , @xmath23 is often not poisson - distributed i.e. @xmath39 ( see  [ describe ] ) . the term shot - noise is often used to describe poissionian discrete fluctuations ,",
    "but in this paper we will use it more broadly to include non - poissonian discrete fluctuations as well .",
    "finally , we note that we use the term quasar counts throughout this paper to refer to the photon counts from a quasar , rather than the number of quasars in a given patch of sky .",
    "we discuss briefly here aspects of the data - processing necessary for understanding the noise properties of the reduced quasar spectrum .",
    "the reader is referred to horne @xcite , zuo & bond @xcite , barlow & sargent @xcite , rauch et al .",
    "@xcite and cen et al .",
    "@xcite for more discussions .",
    "the raw data consist of a two - dimensional ( spatial and spectral ) array of counts ( data numbers or photon counts converted from them ) from a ccd image . the one - dimensional array of estimated quasar counts in the spectral direction ( as a function of velocity , redshift or wavelength ) is obtained by collapsing the data in the spatial direction in the following fashion : @xmath40 we have introduced and will stick with the following notations : the latin index such as @xmath41 and the greek index such as @xmath4 denote the spatial and spectral coordinates respectively of a ccd pixel ( there are in fact a few exceptions , which should be clear from the context ) ; @xmath42 is our estimated quasar count , @xmath43 is the raw count , and @xmath44 is the mean background count which includes the sky and the readout offset ; @xmath45 is a weighting of the spatial pixels for each spectral coordinate @xmath46 , and @xmath47 represents a rebinning of the spectral pixels that is sometimes done to achieve , for instance , a linear wavelength scale .",
    "note that the @xmath4 and @xmath41 dimensions do not necessarily align with the two perpendicular axes of the ccd chip .",
    "the optical setup could be such that the spectrograph slit appears tilted at an angle to the ccd axes .",
    "we use @xmath48 to emphasize the fact that the quantity of interest is a random variable with fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath49 denotes a discrete average : e.g. @xmath50 where @xmath51 denotes discrete averaging .",
    "implicitly assumed in the above formulation is that the discrete average @xmath44 is known , which is of course not strictly true , but since a typical slit covers a significant number of pixels that do not have any quasar photons , and since the background is often quite uniform , the discrete average can be estimated to high accuracy .",
    "note also the readout offset can be measured using short exposures with closed shutters or from the ccd overscan region .",
    "the weighting @xmath45 typically has non - trivial spectral dependence ( @xmath46 ) to remove at least two artifacts : variations in detector efficiency across the chip and a non - flat blaze .",
    "the former is usually estimated in a procedure called flat - fielding by shining a lamp into the detection system .",
    "the latter arises because of the non - trivial shape of a diffraction order .",
    "this can be partially estimated in the flat - fielding procedure , but is best done using a spectrophotometric standard star , usually a white dwarf . while the correction for the first artifact should be quite accurate ,",
    "the blaze - removal is often approximate .",
    "any residual that is not correctly removed will show up in the form of a non - trivial effective continuum .",
    "we will see in  [ systematics ] perhaps some evidence of it .",
    "we assume in this paper that such artifacts show up as fluctuations on large scales ( since the blaze itself is smoothly and slowly varying across a given order ) but not on small scales ( we will quantify the scales later on ) .    to make the above concrete",
    ", the raw count is given by : @xmath52 where the quasar contribution has the following discrete average : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the point - spread function which describes how the light from the quasar gets spread - out in the spatial direction @xmath41 at a given spectral coordinate @xmath46 , and @xmath55 accounts for the variation of the blaze and quantum efficiency as a function of wavelength .",
    "the symbol @xmath56 denotes the underlying quasar count ( or cosmic signal i.e. discrete averaged ) .    many different rebinning kernels @xmath47 ( eq . [ [ ncount ] ] ) are possible .",
    "the simplest choice is of course no rebinning with @xmath57 .",
    "there are several possible choices of the weighting @xmath45 ( eq . [ [ ncount ] ] ) , but any sensible choice has to satisfy the requirement that @xmath58 , up to some constant normalization factor .",
    "this assumes that artificial fluctuations introduced by the blaze or detector efficiency are correctly taken out .",
    "if not , it shows up effectively as part of the continuum .",
    "we give two examples of @xmath45 here .",
    "the first is basically a uniform weighting over the spatial pixels that correspond to a given spectral coordinate : @xmath59 where the range of @xmath41 , or @xmath60 , is chosen to lie within , say , some fraction of the quasar seeing disk .",
    "there is sometimes an additional complication due to cosmic ray hits , which will be discussed below .",
    "the second is a minimum variance weighting ( different from minimum variance weighting for measuring the power spectrum ;  [ random ] ) over the spatial pixels , introduced by horne @xcite : @xmath61 ^ 2 / v_{\\rm raw}^{j \\beta } ) \\label{w2}\\ ] ] where @xmath62 is the variance in the raw count : @xmath63 where @xmath64 , the background variance , has two contributions , the sky variance @xmath65 and the readout variance @xmath66 .",
    "a word of caution is necessary here regarding the second weighting .",
    "the raw variance , @xmath67 , depends on the underlying cosmic signal or quasar count ( @xmath68 i.e. discrete averaged ) which is not directly observable ( the discrete averaged sky count and the true readout variance are also strictly speaking not directly observable , but they can be estimated quite accurately because they are relatively uniform and can be observed over a larger number of pixels )",
    ". modeling @xmath69 using the measured raw count ( i.e. using @xmath70 instead of @xmath71 in eq .",
    "[ [ vraw ] ] ) could lead to a biased estimation of @xmath72 .",
    "horne @xcite suggested an iterative scheme to avoid this problem , but implementations of this weighting should be checked for a possible bias .",
    "pixels affected by cosmic - ray hits , which are usually easy to identify because of their wild fluctuations and spiky nature , are dealt with in two different ways , depending on the severity . for a given spectral coordinate , if only a small fraction of the corresponding spatial pixels are affected , the weighting in eq .",
    "( [ w1 ] ) or eq .",
    "( [ w2 ] ) is simply modified by allowing @xmath41 and @xmath60 to only range over the unaffected spatial pixels .",
    "however , if all or most corresponding spatial pixels are affected , then all recorded counts at that spectral coordinate are discarded , leaving a gap in the reduced quasar spectrum .",
    "gaps could result also because of metal - line removal ( an alternative would be to fit for the metal - line and subtract , instead of simply discarding the pixels ) or defects in the ccd .    finally , the ( random ) error - array output at the end of the data reduction corresponds to an estimate of @xmath73 where we have assumed that the noise - fluctuations are independent among the pixels .",
    "we emphasize that in practice the error - array is only an _ estimate _ of the above quantity , because the true @xmath74 is unknown , but is estimated using the observed raw counts ( using @xmath70 instead of @xmath68 in eq .",
    "[ [ vraw ] ] ) .",
    "it is clear from the above discussion that in general fluctuations in @xmath75 are non - poissonian , in the sense that @xmath76 .",
    "this is because of several reasons .",
    "first , @xmath23 suffers from additional discrete fluctuations from the background counts .",
    "second , the weighting @xmath47 and @xmath45 are in general non - trivial ( i.e. not unity )",
    ". a very simple example of the effect of non - unit weights is : suppose we multiply a poisson variable by a factor of 2 and call the result @xmath77 , it is easy to see that @xmath78 .    for the rest of this paper , we will pick for simplicity the weighting kernels @xmath57 and @xmath79 as given by eq .",
    "( [ w1 ] ) . in the appendices",
    "we will indicate where some of our expressions have to be modified to account for more general weightings .      for illustrations , and for later analyses ,",
    "we have generated several different qso spectra .",
    "the underlying noiseless ( theoretical ) transmission ( @xmath11 ) is shown in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ nonoise ] , and its associated power spectrum is shown in the top panel of the same figure .",
    "this is drawn from a scdm ( standard cold dark matter ) simulation discussed in gnedin @xcite which made use of the hydro - pm algorithm developed by gnedin & hui @xcite .",
    "the cell - size ( comoving size of @xmath80 ) is small enough to resolve the effective jeans scale , and so should retain all small scale structures .",
    "however , the box - size is unrealistically small ( comoving size @xmath81 ) which means a significant amount of large scale power is missing . for most of our investigations here , it is not necessary that the simulations are highly realistic , but our simulated transmission power spectrum is in fact broadly consistent with an observed one ( fig .",
    "[ demonstrate ] ) .",
    "the long line of sight in fig .",
    "[ nonoise ] is generated by shooting a ray at some oblique angle through the simulation box and allowing it to wrap around the box several times , but never repeating itself .",
    "the mean redshift here is @xmath82 .",
    "the ionizing background is chosen to give @xmath83 ( ) .",
    "an example of a somewhat realistic reduced qso spectrum ( @xmath84 in eq .",
    "[ [ ncount ] ] ) and its error array ( eq . [ [ deltapn ] ] ) can be found in the bottom two panels of fig .",
    "[ highkecknm ] ( ignore the other two panels for the moment ) .",
    "they are generated based on the prescriptions given in ",
    "[ describe ] , assuming @xmath85 and @xmath45 is given by eq .",
    "( [ w1 ] ) . briefly speaking",
    ", what we do is to first generate an array of @xmath86 which represents @xmath87 ( i.e. we do not actually simulate the full two - dimensional ccd image ; the spatial dimension is collapsed into @xmath86 ) ; then , we create a poisson realization of the ( intermediate ) quasar count @xmath88 where @xmath36 is the continuum and @xmath89 is predicted by our cosmological model ; we similarly create a poisson realization of the background count @xmath90 where the constant represents some fraction less than 1 and then subtract from it its poisson mean , the end - result is then added to the above quasar count ; lastly , we divide by @xmath86 to obtain the reduced quasar count @xmath42 .",
    "note that the overall level of the reduced quasar count can be scaled up or down ( because we are not interested in the absolute brightness of the quasar ) , provided the error array is scaled accordingly to conserve signal - to - noise ( s / n ; count divided by square root of the variance ) .",
    "this example resembles a high quality keck hires spectrum , with s / n reaching up to 100 at certain pixels .",
    "it is composed of 12 echelle orders , @xmath91 each ( e.g. the instrument hires on the keck telescope is an echelle spectrograph which consists of two diffraction gratings crossed at @xmath92 to each other ; see vogt et al . ) .",
    "the pixel size is @xmath93 with a resolution full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) of @xmath94 .",
    "the example represents a case in which a relative calibration ( but not necessarily absolute fluxing ) between the orders has been attempted .",
    "the dashed line in the bottom panel shows the input continuum .",
    "the error - array shows a lot of variations .",
    "a model of the random error as gaussian distributed with uniform s / n that is sometimes used in the literature misses much structure . about @xmath95 of the spectrum consists of gaps which arise due to severe cosmic - ray hits .",
    "the spikes in the error - array correspond to wavelengths at which a fraction , but not all , of the corresponding spatial pixels are affected by cosmic - ray hits .",
    "they also take up @xmath95 of the spectrum .",
    "it is easy to see how these spikes arise from eq .",
    "( [ w1 ] ) and ( [ deltapn ] ) . at wavelengths where",
    "some of the spatial pixels are thrown out because of cosmic - ray hits , @xmath79 is enhanced because the sum over @xmath60 in its denominator is restricted to fewer pixels . since it is the square of @xmath79 that enters into the variance , a modest enhancement becomes a spike .",
    "note how for each echelle order , the s / n drops towards the two ends .",
    "this is because of the blaze function which tends to suppress the flux at the ends .",
    "note also that the s / n has a general decline towards the blue .",
    "this is due to a combination of a falling continuum , and decreasing detector efficiency .",
    "sometimes , a relative calibration between echelle orders is either difficult or simply not attempted .",
    "an example is shown in fig .",
    "[ highkecknm.c ] .",
    "note how the continuum is broken into 12 discontinuous pieces .",
    "these are taken from continuum - fits to actual data .",
    "an example of data with much poorer quality is shown in fig .",
    "[ licknm_cont3l ] .",
    "the pixel size is @xmath96 and the fwhm is @xmath97 .",
    "the s / n is about 10 times worse than the two examples above .",
    "such a spectrum could be the output of , say , a low dispersion single - grating spectrograph , which does not have the characteristic division into short pieces as in the case of the echelle spectrograph .",
    "all other simulated data in this paper are slight variations of the above , which will be described in turn at the appropriate places .",
    "given the one - dimensional array of estimated quasar counts @xmath42 ( eq . [ [ ncount ] ] ) , how should one go about estimating the two - point correlation or the power spectrum ?",
    "a common practice is to first continuum - fit , i.e. to estimate the continuum level @xmath98 and divide @xmath75 by it to obtain an estimate of the transmission @xmath99 .",
    "then , the estimators for the un - normalized two - point correlation and power spectrum ( eq . [ [ pxidef0 ] ] ) are : @xmath100 where @xmath101 subtracts out the shot - noise ( i.e. a bias ) , and @xmath102 and @xmath103 are weighting kernels for which we will give some examples shortly ( to be distinguished from @xmath47 in eq . [ [ ncount ] ] ) . these are commonly called quadratic estimators for the simple fact that they make use of the data @xmath104 in quadratic combinations .    defining the mean transmission to be @xmath21 , the obvious extensions of the above estimators , for the normalized two - point correlation and power spectrum ( eq . [ [ pxidef ] ] ; unless otherwise stated ,",
    "the two - point correlation or power spectrum with no qualifications refer to the normalized version ) , are @xmath105    however , the form of the power spectrum or two - point correlation estimator given above suggests an interesting variation which allows us to avoid continuum - fitting altogether : @xmath106 can be estimated instead by @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the mean count defined by @xmath109 . here",
    "@xmath110 denotes the cosmic average i.e. this corresponds to averaging out the cosmic fluctuations in @xmath10 , for a fixed continuum ( @xmath111 where @xmath112 is the true continuum ) .",
    "interchangeably with @xmath29 .",
    "see  [ notation ] . ]",
    "note that the mean count is dependent upon @xmath4 because of the slowly varying continuum .",
    "we will discuss how to estimate @xmath113 shortly .",
    "the key here is that the absolute level of the continuum gets divided out by definition .",
    "hence , let us define the following alternative estimators of the two - point correlation and power spectrum :    [ hatp ] @xmath114    this alternative power spectrum estimator is what we will focus on , but we will also briefly investigate the behavior of the estimators in eq .",
    "( [ hatp0 ] ) and ( [ hatpold ] ) .",
    "it remains to specify what @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath101 are .",
    "the simplest choice is to use uniform weighting i.e. for the two - point correlation , it corresponds to : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is equal to one if the two pixels @xmath4 and @xmath46 are separated by a distance @xmath14 ( or more generally , the distance falls into a bin that is centered around @xmath14 with some finite width ) , and zero otherwise . using the above @xmath102 corresponds to simply counting all pairs separated by a distance @xmath14 , normalized by the total number of pairs .    with the above weighting ,",
    "( [ hatp ] ) is analogous to an estimator of the two - point correlation introduced by landy & szalay @xcite for galaxy surveys : @xmath117 , if one identifies @xmath118 with @xmath119 , @xmath120 with @xmath121 and @xmath122 with @xmath123 and assumes @xmath113 varies very slowly with @xmath4 on the scale of interest @xmath14 ( the analogy becomes exact in the limit of a uniform @xmath113 ) . as shown by landy & szalay @xcite",
    "( see also ) , a common alternative estimator @xmath124 ( equivalent to the estimator used by e.g. ) is actually less desirable as it gives a larger variance compared to @xmath117",
    ".    with this being said , we are going to focus our attention on the power spectrum from now on , although most of our treatments below can be applied to the two - point correlation as well . for the power spectrum , the simplest choice of uniform weighting corresponds to :    [ wkbkuniform ] @xmath125    where @xmath126 is the total length of the spectrum ( in whatever units one prefers ) and @xmath127 is the total number of spectral pixels , @xmath128 represents an average of the fourier basis over some bin or band in k - space i.e. we estimate the power spectrum at a bin centered at @xmath16 by averaging over contributions from each @xmath129 that belongs to the bin ( @xmath130 is the total number of modes in it ) .",
    "the symbol @xmath101 represents the shot - noise contribution to the power that has to be subtracted off , @xmath131 and @xmath132 represent the point - spread function and the blaze as in eq .",
    "( [ ggnq ] ) , and @xmath133 is the background contribution to the shot - noise ( including the sky and readout , see eq . [ [ vraw ] ] ) . note how a part of the shot - noise depends on the reciprocal of the mean quasar count , as expected for poisson fluctuations , quite analogous to the shot - noise of galaxy distributions .",
    "however , the factor @xmath134 , which arises from non - trivial weighting of ccd pixels ( @xmath135 ; eq .",
    "[ [ ncount ] ] ) , signifies that the shot - noise is not strictly poisson distributed . moreover , there are extra contributions to the shot - noise from the background counts , which are generally absent in the case of galaxy surveys .",
    "derivations of the above statements are given in appendix a.    the corresponding power spectrum estimator obeys : @xmath136 where @xmath137 is a window function that resembles , for @xmath138 , a delta function centered at @xmath139 with a width of the order of @xmath140 .",
    "the normalization of @xmath103 in eq .",
    "( [ wkuniform ] ) ensures that @xmath141 .",
    "see appendix a for a derivation",
    ".    it should be emphasized , however , that the above statements are strictly true only if one ignores uncertainties in the mean count @xmath142 ",
    "i.e. @xmath143 is not known a priori but is instead estimated from the same data from which one is trying to measure correlations .",
    "we will discuss this further in  [ beyond ] .",
    "it suffices to say here that our results in this section remain valid as long as one stays away from scales comparable to the entire length of the quasar spectrum .",
    "the power spectrum estimator @xmath144 in eq .",
    "( [ hatp ] ) , which we are going to focus most of our attention on , requires an estimate of mean count @xmath143 .",

    "while this can give us a crude idea of how significant the continuum power spectrum is , it is not entirely satisfactory because part of what has been ascribed to the continuum might actually be large scale fluctuations in the cosmic signal @xmath202 that we are after , or vice versa .    the second option that comes to mind is to measure the continuum power spectrum from regions where the continuum determination is relatively secure .",
    "two possibilities are * a. * low redshift quasar spectra where the forest is much less dense , and * b. * regions of spectra which lie redward of ly@xmath4 emission .",

    "obviously , more tests are needed . ] * further , one can test the hypothesis that the excess in blue continuum power is due to contamination from the forest : if this is true , one expects the red and blue continuum power spectra to converge , as one goes to lower redshift quasars , because presumably , the blue continuum power spectrum should be less affected by the forest at lower redshifts . even if their difference does not converge to zero ( as suggested by the larger number of broad emission lines on the red side ) , but to some small but finite value , this is still a useful exercise because it gives us an idea of how different the red and blue continuum power spectra can be . if we can determine the blue continuum power spectrum to an accuracy of @xmath172 say , and use this to correct for the transmission power spectrum on large scales , this is already a significant improvement over not correcting for the large scale power , or simply throwing away the information on large scales altogether .",
    "for instance , if the blue continuum power does become comparable with the transmission power at @xmath207 , not subtracting off the spurious power would result in a fractional error of @xmath208 , while subtracting off an approximate blue continuum power accurate to @xmath172 reduces the error by an order of magnitude .    obviously , more testing using observed data is warranted , particularly on the estimation of red and blue continuum power as a function of redshift .",
    "this will be carried out in a separate paper .",
    "one natural question that might occur to the reader is whether a universal continuum power spectrum actually exists , given the large observed variations in the continuum from one quasar to another .",
    "it suffices to note that given an ensemble , the averaged power spectrum is _ always _ a well - defined quantity .",
    "the tricky part is to make sure the ensemble from which one estimates the continuum power spectrum has the same averaged continuum power spectrum as the ensemble of continua in the forest regions of interest . as a simple example : one might want to make sure the same proportion of radio - loud quasars are included in both ensembles",
    "this is probably desirable if one uses the working hypothesis that low redshift blue continuum power is similar to high redshift blue continuum power , as suggested above .",
    "alternatively , if the hypothesis that blue and red continuum power spectra resemble each other irrespective of redshift turns out to be a reasonable one , the simplest way to make sure one has the right ensemble is to use both sides of ly@xmath4 for any give quasar : use the blue side for its forest , and the red side for its continuum .    with all of the above caveats in mind ,",
    "let us illustrate the technique of power correction with two idealized examples , where it is assumed the right ensemble of continua is in hand .    in fig .",
    "[ combkeck ] , we show in the bottom panel a simulated spectrum with a somewhat unusual continuum ( middle panel ) with a fair amount of fluctuations .",

    "( [ p3 ] ) while the dashed line shows @xmath211 from eq .",

    "a simple ansatz is to assume @xmath346 , in other words , spending more time for fainter quasars because it takes longer to beat down the shot - noise , except that we have a normalizing factor @xmath4 which enforces the constraint of total observing time : @xmath347 / \\int_{a_{\\rm min}}^a a ' n(a ' ) da'$ ] where @xmath348 is the number of quasars with @xmath253 falling in the given range , and @xmath349 corresponds to the brightest quasar in one s sample .",
    "then , we can determine how many quasars one should include , starting from the brightest one , or how faint one should go by minimizing @xmath350^{-1 } p(k_{\\rm int.})^2 ( 1 + 1/\\alpha)^2 $ ] with respect to @xmath253 .",
    "_ the following is particularly relevant for sdss or comparable observations . _    * in addition to contributing to the power spectrum variance , shot - noise also contributes a bias which has to be subtracted off ( see e.g. fig . [ licknm_cont3l ] ) .",
    "this is quite important for sdss because , with @xmath351 sightlines , the survey has the capability of reducing the fractional error of the power spectrum to @xmath352 per mode .",
    "therefore , a bias of @xmath353 , depending on the scale of interest ( as indicated by the top dotted line in fig .",
    "[ demonstrate ] ) , is not acceptable and should be subtracted off .",
    "we note that analyses so far in the literature ( e.g. ) focused on higher quality data where @xmath354 , with @xmath264 ranging from about @xmath355 to @xmath356 , and so according to eq .",
    "( [ bksn ] ) and fig . [ demonstrate ] , the shot - noise bias was about @xmath1 of the power or smaller and therefore could be ignored , although a more careful check should be performed for some datasets with lower @xmath275 . *",
    "the low resolution of sdss spectra implies that it would be difficult to obtain useful information on scales @xmath357 or @xmath358 . on larger scales or smaller @xmath16 s",
    ", two problems have to be reckoned with . for @xmath359 ,",
    "the resolution window suppresses the power by @xmath172 or more  therefore , one needs to have an accurate measure of the resolution window to recover the true transmission power spectrum .",
    "this can be achieved by using narrow metal lines or arc lines .",
    "there are relatively few sky lines in the relevant part of the spectrum . * for scales @xmath360 or @xmath361 , the effect of the continuum has to be properly taken into account , and the method of  [ beyond ] can be useful here . from fig .",
    "[ demonstrate ] , it is clear that the range of scales accessible to sdss would be quite limited unless a correction for continuum contamination is applied .",
    "it is worth pointing out that while the above quoted numbers are all based on @xmath277 , we do not expect them to change significantly for @xmath362 or @xmath169 .",
    "this is in part because of the slow evolution of the transmission power spectrum ",
    "the growth of the mass spectrum with time is partially compensated by the lowering of the mean decrement ( ) .",
    "at least three issues remain to be explored in future work .",
    "as we have emphasized , the concept of correcting for continuum contamination in the transmission power on large scales as laid out in  [ beyond ] is an interesting one , but requires more testing .",
    "an important check is the measurement of continuum power spectrum as a function of redshift on both sides of ly@xmath4 emission .",
    "second , counts - in - cells analysis ( i.e. measuring moments of the one - point probability distribution function ) , just like power spectrum analysis , requires shot - noise subtraction , and since typically one considers cells at the limit of resolution , shot - noise is likely non - negligible except for high s / n spectra .",
    "counts - in - cells analysis provides a very interesting way to test the gravitational instability paradigm ( ) , and should be done with care .",
    "useful expressions will be presented elsewhere ( ) .",
    "lastly , as is hopefully clear by now , the spirit of the methods presented in this paper is to avoid continuum - fitting and replace it with trend - removal .",
    "we have demonstrated that this is possible for measuring the transmission power spectrum .",
    "however , other quantities of interest such as the mean decrement requires an estimate of the continuum , by definition .",
    "furthermore , to theoretically interpret the transmission power spectrum in terms of the mass fluctuation , current methods require the measurement of the mean decrement to fix a free parameter in one s cosmological model , which is a combination of the ionizing background , the mean baryon density and the mean temperature .",
    "therefore , in a sense , the technique of trend - removal only goes half - way in solving the problem of continuum - fitting .",
    "although we still recommend our method over continuum - fitting because the transmission power spectrum is an unambiguous quantity which can and should be determined as accurately as possible ( not to mention the fact that continuum - fitting is difficult with low s / n or low resolution , or at high @xmath363 ) , there is clearly a need for an alternative method to bridge the gap between the measured transmission power and the theoretically interesting mass power .",
    "this will be explored in future publications ( ) .",
