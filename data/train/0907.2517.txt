    "the hofstadter butterfly is well known since the work of hofstadter on the electron transmission through a two - dimensional ordered lattice perturbed by a perpendicularly applied uniform magnetic field @xcite .",
    "few experimental attempts have been made to observe signatures of this phenomenon in two - dimensional electron systems @xcite .",
    "recently , an experimental electromagnetic realization of the hofstadter butterfly was done by studying the transmission of microwaves through an array of @xmath1 scatterers inserted into a waveguide when the modulation length of this unidimensional periodic lattice changed @xcite .",
    "these authors used cylindrical scatterers introduced into a rectangular microwave waveguide . in this study ,",
    "the stopbands were produced by braggs reflection on the transmission spectra and the illustration of the hofstadter butterfly exhibited self - similar structures .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the transmission of an acoustic pulse through a lattice composed of an assembly of variable helmholtz resonators that are the scatterers @xcite .",
    "a particularity of this work is the use of scatterers that can exhibit resonant scattering at wavelength much larger then the scatterers ( well known examples of helmholtz resonators are the bottle of wine that have resonances for frequencies corresponding to wavelengths of the order of the meter ) .",
    "the resonators are uniformly distributed along a cylindrical waveguide .",
    "each helmholtz resonator is constituted by two cylindrical tubes which play the role of neck and cavity of the resonator .",
    "the length of the helmholtz cavity is a variable parameter and the lattice spacing constant @xmath2 between each resonator is fixed .",
    "the propagation of sound wave into a tunnel with a periodic array of helmholtz resonators has been already studied @xcite and different kinds of stopband appear in the transmission coefficient .",
    "in addition to bragg stopbands caused by the spatial periodicity of the lattice , resonances of the helmholtz resonator create other `` stopping bands '' called scatterer stopbands which are non - existent in @xcite .",
    "we show that a realization of the hofstadter butterfly is obtained experimentally with acoustic waves .",
    "the effects of the scatterer stopbands are examined .",
    "experimental work is completed by an analytical and a numerical analysis , and all show self - similar structure .",

    "to determine the impedance of a helmholtz resonator , we need to a relation pressure @xmath38 and velocity @xmath39 between the entrance ( e ) and the end ( f ) of the resonator ( fig .",

    "applying classical lossless plane wave technique it is found that @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are respectively the characteristic impedance of neck and cavity , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are respectively the length of the neck and the length of the volume cavity , and subscripts @xmath45 and @xmath46 refer to entrance and end of the resonator .",
    "@xmath47 represents the added length to the neck due to the discontinuity of the sections .",
    "this length takes generally the form @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the radius of the neck .",

[ fig2 ] .",

    "a periodic modulation of the lengths of the cavity resonators was applied with the period length as a parameter .",

    "the periodic rectangular modulation implies only two values for the cavity length of each helmholtz resonator . when this length vanishes , the resonator effects on the propagation are completely invisible in the frequency range of interest . when @xmath83 is written as @xmath84 , the lattice is periodic with a period length @xmath85 . in this case",
