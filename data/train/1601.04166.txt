    "the atiyah - singer index theorem is a fundamental discovery in the history of mathematics .",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the original argument . as with any major result ,",
    "the complete proof is difficult to grasp , lengthy and uses technicalities which take a long time to absorb .",
    "there are various treatments of this theorem which have appeared and the literature on the index theorem is vast , so we do not attempt a summary .",
    "the goal of this note is to give an introduction to a particular viewpoint on index theory , based on a proof of the index theorem using lie groupoids as outlined by a. connes in @xcite .",
    "ultimately , the aim would be to give a treatment of the atiyah - singer index theorem , which is comprehensive , self - contained ( using as little external knowledge as possible ) and starting from first principles .",
    "we have not achieved this goal here and our attempt should be viewed as a modest indication of how it could be achieved . secondly , it is the view of the author that the language and tools needed to understand the groupoid viewpoint are an obstacle that is worthwhile to overcome by the reader , since they lead naturally to possible extensions of the index theorem in various directions .",
    "we give evidence for this assertion by quoting the recent literature of this very active field .",
    "let us give a brief summary of the literature on the groupoid approach to the atiyah - singer index theorem .",
    "this summary is necessarily incomplete and the author apologizes in advance for this .",
    "an exposition of the tangent groupoid proof of the index theorem for dirac operators which mostly suppresses the language of groupoids is given by higson in @xcite .",
    "furthermore , debord and lescure have written up an exposition about groupoids and index theory which contains an essentially complete proof of the index theorem in @xcite .",
    "we have drawn considerable inspiration from these lecture notes , especially the idea of using the groupoid pseudodifferential calculus to study the generalized analytic index and show that it equals the fredholm index ( a detail omitted in @xcite ) . in @xcite ,",
    "section 6.1 , the reader can find a version of the proof of the index theorem which has the advantage of being easily generalized to the case of manifolds with singularities .",
    "some aspects of the groupoid proof are exposed in @xcite with a focus on the connections to deformation quantization and the baum - connes conjecture .",
    "the paper @xcite contains an extension of conneses proof to the case of a compact manifold with boundary which gives a type of atiyah - patodi - singer index theorem .",
    "we have made use of an idea in this paper , namely the formulation of the generalized connes - thom isomorphism ( thm .",
    "[ thm : enn ] ) .    at the end of this paper",
    "we will discuss the index theory with values in the @xmath0-theory group of the @xmath1-algebra of a lie groupoid .",
    "we note that the generalized analytic index which we defined via the tangent groupoid deformation no longer equals the fredholm index when the manifold @xmath2 has a boundary ( or more generally corners ) .",
    "in such a case we analyze the generalized index problem stated as a topological calculation of the analytic index . in the general case the analytic index is defined via an adiabatic deformation groupoid , @xcite .",
    "we briefly sketch the topological index theorem for manifolds with corners which is due to monthubert and nistor , @xcite .",
    "then we consider the setting for boundary value problems on manifolds with corners and announce a result due to the author which generalizes monthubert and nistor s index theorem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the second section",
    "we introduce lie groupoids and lie algebroids .",
    "we discuss in particular the bibundle category of lie groupoids with the generalized morphisms and the category of regular poisson spaces based on @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . in the third section",
    "we give a brief introduction to pseudodifferential operators on groupoids and groupoid @xmath1-algebras .",
    "we define the bimodule category of @xmath1 and discuss the functoriality with regard to the bibundle category of lie groupoids .",
    "we make some remarks on smooth foliations and desingularization of the space of leafs in section four . in the fifth section we focus on deformation groupoids , with particular focus on the tangent groupoid as defined by a. connes .",
    "we include a proof that the tangent groupoid is a lie groupoid . in section six we state the general connes - thom isomorphism inspired by the theorem of connes - thom and more specifically based on @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , we finish the proof of the atiyah - singer index theorem in section seven .",
    "the eighth section is concerned with the generalized baum - connes conjecture for lie groupoids .",
    "we define the analytic and geometric @xmath0-homology for lie groupoids , the corresponding assembly mappings as well as the comparison map based on @xcite . in section nine we describe recent work on extensions of the index theorem to non - compact and singular manifolds ( possibly with additional boundary conditions ) .",
    "we introduce the category consisting of lie groupoids as the objects and so - called _ correspondences _ or _ generalized morphisms _ as the arrows . the corresponding notion of _ algebroid _ and",
    "_ lie algebroid _ will be introduced afterwards .",
    "we should emphasize at this point that the mere definition of a groupoid is exceedingly simple : they can be viewed as generalized groups where the operation of composition is only partially defined .",
    "more importantly than a concept , groupoids can be viewed as a useful language ( similarly to category theory itself ) as they generalize simultaneously such concepts as groups , singular spaces , sets , equivalence relations and foliations .",
    "the driving force behind the concept is the correct notion of isomorphism inside a suitable category of groupoids .",
    "this notion of isomorphism is described by _",
    "morita equivalence _ and we will see later how this name is motivated ( the connection to ring theory in terms of modules over @xmath1-algebras ) .",
