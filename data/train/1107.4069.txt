    "there exists a torque cutoff ( gt80 , w97 ) such that only a finite range of @xmath78 contribute strongly to the total torque ( see figure [ difffig ] ) . as the planet migrates through the disk it sweeps through various resonances for the global modes .",
    "if the excess torque generated by a @xmath78-mode that is in resonance exceeds the torque deficit due to all the other @xmath78 within the torque cutoff then the migration can be stopped by the trapped wave resonance .",
    "we can estimate the maximum viscosity parameter @xmath72 such that the migration can be halted by this effect by setting the maximal gain @xmath69 roughly equal to the width of the torque cutoff m_cutoff f ( ) , where @xmath79 is a factor of few that absorbs the variation of the torque for azimuthal modes within the torque cutoff .",
    "this is the worst case assumption , applicable since away from the strong resonant peak where the gain is @xmath80 , we have a reduced gain , @xmath81 .",

    "we have @xmath87 giving ( ) ^3/2 ^-1/2 .",
    "thus if the viscosity parameter @xmath72 is smaller than ( ) ^1/4 ( ) ^5/2 ~ ( ) ^5/2 [ alphaeq ] type i migration can be halted by trapped modes in the disk .",
    "the net lindblad torque for the first @xmath88 modes are shown in figure [ torquefig ] for various combinations of disk scale height @xmath89 and viscosity @xmath72 .",
    "as a planet migrates slowly inwards from large @xmath90 , the net lindblad torque , @xmath91 , is negative , driving the planet inwards . when the planet encounters a disk resonance strong enough such that @xmath92 the planet can become trapped .",
    "further migration inwards towards the resonance causes the net lindblad torque to become positive , driving the planet outwards , while outwards migration away from the resonance leads to a net negative lindblad torque , driving the planet inwards , effectively trapping the planet where @xmath93 .    in figure",
    "[ torquefig ] , for low viscosity ( @xmath94 ) , we see many locations of effective planet trapping for disks with both @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "however for higher viscosity ( @xmath97 ) we only see trapping for @xmath95 , consistent with our estimate .",
    "including the effect of the corotation torque @xmath98 requires a location where @xmath99 to trap the planet .",
    "the value of the unsaturated corotation torque in an isothermal disk is proportional to the vortensity gradient at the corotation point ( gt79 ) , t_cr - .|_r_cr , and can be larger than the non - resonant net lindblad torque near sharp density transitions .",
    "@xcite also showed that the corotation can contribute a significant torque in the presence of entropy gradients in non - barotropic disks .",
    "depending on the sign of the density and entropy gradients in the disk at the planet location the corotation torque can make it easier or more difficult to trap a planet using the trapped wave disk resonance discussed above .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that the spiral density waves generated by a perturbing planet typically steepen as they propagate and can quickly act to shock and damp out the wave . for waves resonant in the disk",
    "this would lead to a non - linear resonance , in which the primary means of dissipation involves wave shocks .",
    "detailed examination of the non - linear response of the disk is left for later work , and may perhaps be best approached numerically .",
    "however , we note that typically for forced non - linear resonators , such as shock tubes , the resonator quality factor , @xmath100 , effectively our resonant gain , scales as the inverse square root of the forced amplitude @xcite .",
    "this implies that the non - linear resonant gain decreases with with an increase in the planet mass , and that there is a cutoff mass above which the resonance can no longer halt type i migration .",
    "we have shown that for small planets the linear response of a disk resonance caused by an inner reflecting edge can act to trap planets at a few times the inner disk radius .",
    "the exact location of this trapping depends on the details of the disk parameters and dissipation mechanism . for larger planets ,",
    "the disk will likely undergo a non - linear resonance , which typically has non - linear resonant gain decreasing with increasing planet mass .",
    "this implies that above a certain cutoff mass , the resonant gain due to the non - linear resonance will be insufficient to halt migration , and the planets will continue to migrate inwards through the inner disk edge .",
    "there they will be halted at @xmath101 when the lowest order outer lindblad resonance is located within the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the corotation torque is also important near these edges , but is susceptible to saturation , unless the viscosity is sufficiently high .",
    "if unsaturated the corotation torque is mainly active when the planet is very close to the disk edge and the density gradient ( and thus vortensity gradient ) are strongest .",
    "however , further from the disk edge where the wave trapping resonance is active , both effects may be important in determining the net torque .",
    "this naturally generates two populations of planets , with halting radius a few times the inner disk edge for smaller planets , and with larger planets halted inside the inner disk edge .",
    "this process may help to explain the observations of planets close to solar type stars by @xcite which showed that larger planets were halted with typical periods of @xmath2 days , corresponding to @xmath102 au , while smaller planets were halted with typical periods of @xmath103 days , @xmath104 au , consistent with inner disk edges with periods of @xmath105 days corresponding to @xmath106 au .",
    "this process may also be important for planets located near other reflecting edges within the disk , such as the edges of magnetic dead zones ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or the edge of a gap in the disk opened by a giant planet ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    the effect of turbulent density fluctuations on this wave resonance may be to ratchet the system through successive `` traps '' , if the variation is on a scale similar to the separation between the lindblad resonances , such that the relative amplitudes of the lindblad torques are affected .",
    "larger resonant peaks will be more difficult to overcome , however a detailed study of the effect of turbulence is beyond the scope of the current work .",
    "i would like to acknowledge kind advice and useful conversations regarding this work with peter goldreich , dong lai , christian ott , john johnson , scott gregory , and jason wright .",
    "this work was carried out with the support of a sherman fairchild postdoctoral fellowship at the california institute of technology ."
