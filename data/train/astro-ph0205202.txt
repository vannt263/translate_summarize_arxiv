    "the theory of inflation is presently the most appealing candidate for describing the early universe .",
    "inflation essentially consists of a phase of accelerated expansion which took place at a very high energy scale .",
    "one of the main reasons for such an appeal is the fact that inflation is deeply rooted in the basic principles of general relativity and field theory , which are well - tested theories .",
    "it is because all the forms of energy gravitate in general relativity that one of them , the pressure , which can be negative in field theory , is able to cause the acceleration in the expansion of the universe .",
    "in addition , when the principles of quantum mechanics are taken into account , inflation provides a natural explanation for the origin of the large scale structures and the associated temperature anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation  @xcite .",
    "inflation makes four key predictions : ( i ) the curvature of the space - like sections vanishes , i.e. the total energy density , relative to the critical density , is @xmath1 , ( ii ) the power spectrum of density fluctuations is almost scale invariant , i.e. its spectral index is @xmath2 , ( iii ) there is a background of primordial gravitational waves ( which is also scale invariant ) , and ( iv ) the statistical properties of the cmb are gaussian . in this article",
    "we focus on the last prediction and investigate whether it is a robust and generic property of inflationary models .",
    "the statistical properties of the cmb will be measured with high accuracy by the map and planck satellites  @xcite .",
    "so far the preliminary measurements of the three- and four - point correlation functions  @xcite seem to be consistent with gaussianity .",
    "the fact that the statistical properties of the cmb are gaussian can be directly traced back to the common assumption that the quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field are placed in the vacuum state  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in order to answer the above question , one has to investigate which kind of non - gaussianity shows up if the vacuum state assumption is relaxed  @xcite . in particular , one crucial point is to study whether this modification yields a detectable signal for future cmb or large - scale structure observations .",
    "let us also notice that there exist other mechanisms to produce non - gaussianity within the framework of inflation .",
    "some of them have been studied in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "assuming that the quantum state of the perturbations is a non - vacuum state immediately leads to the following difficulty : non - vacuum initial states imply , in general , a large energy density of inflaton field quanta , not of a cosmological term type  @xcite .",
    "in other words , generically , if the initial state is not the vacuum then there is a back - reaction problem that could upset the inflationary phase .",
    "however , as we will argue below , one can not directly conclude that this would prevent inflation from occurring altogether because , without a detailed calculation , it is difficult to guess what the back - reaction effect on the background would be .",
    "such a detailed calculation is in principle possible by means of the formalism developed in ref .",
    "@xcite . to our knowledge",
    ", such a computation has never been performed .",
    "the calculation of second order effects is clearly a complicated issue and is still the subject of discussions in the literature , see  @xcite for example .",
    "moreover there exist situations where it can be avoided , and this is in fact the case if the number of e - folds is not too large . in this article",
    ", we will not address the general question mentioned above but will rather concentrate on the more modest aim of calculating the non - gaussianity in a case where the back - reaction problem is not too severe , hoping in this way to capture some features of the real situation .",
    "there exist other arguments to study the non - gaussianity that arises from a non - vacuum state .",
    "one of these is the so - called trans - planckian problem of inflation  @xcite : the quantum fluctuations are typically generated from sub - planckian scales and therefore the predictions of inflation depend in fact on hidden assumptions about the physics on length scales smaller than the planck scale .",
    "however , it has recently been shown that inflation is robust to some changes of the standard laws of physics beyond the planck scale .",
    "more precisely , inflation is robust to a modification of the dispersion relation , at least if those changes are not too drastic , in practice if the wigner - kramer - brillouin ( wkb ) evolution of the cosmological perturbations is preserved .",
    "however , modeling trans - planckian physics by a change in the dispersion relation is clearly _ ad - hoc_.",
    "therefore , it is interesting to consider other possibilities ; for example , one could imagine that the inflaton field emerges from the trans - planckian regime in a non - vacuum state .",
    "non - gaussianity would then be , in this case , a signature of non standard physics and it seems to us interesting to quantify this effect .",
    "let us note that similar ideas have been suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite in a slightly different context .",
    "let us also remark that it has been shown recently in ref .",
    "@xcite that placing the cosmological perturbations in a non - vacuum state would lead to possible observable effects , for instance a modification of the consistency check of inflation .",
    "another motivation for calculating non - gaussianity when the initial state is not the vacuum is that this model could be used to test the methods that are being developed to detect non - gaussianity in the future cmb maps .",
    "there have been approaches based on the @xmath3th order moments or the cumulants of the temperature distribution  @xcite , the n - point correlation functions or their spherical harmonic transforms  @xcite , and also works based on the detection of gradients in the wavelet space  @xcite , to mention just a few methods . in the last approach , namely the wavelet analysis of a signal  @xcite , the test maps which were employed were characterized by a non - skewed non - gaussian distribution .",
    "therefore , any non - gaussianity was indicated by a non - zero excess kurtosis of the coefficients associated with the gradients of the signal .",
    "as we will show , this is exactly our case .",
    "this wavelet analysis of a signal was then applied  @xcite to search for the cmb non - gaussian signatures .",
    "more precisely , these authors investigated the detectability of a non - gaussian signal induced by secondary anisotropies , while assuming gaussian - distributed primary anisotropies .",
    "their method  @xcite is unable to detect such non - gaussianity for the map - like instrumental configuration while it can do it for planck - like capabilities .    from the theoretical point of view the simplest way to generalize the vacuum initial state , which contains no privileged scale ,",
    "is to consider an initial state with a _ built - in _ characteristic scale , @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "here , we will consider a non - vacuum state which is simpler and more generic than the one considered in this previous work .",
    "several observables can be used to constrain the parameter space .",
    "a first possibility is to use the cmb anisotropy multipole moments to constrain the number of quanta @xmath3 around the privileged scale .",
    "it has been shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that , typically , this number can not be large and in the present article we will always consider that @xmath3 is a few . with the recent release of the boomerang  @xcite , maxima  @xcite and dasi  @xcite data , which revealed the existence of a first acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum at @xmath5 , followed by a second acoustic peak located at @xmath6 and an evidence for a third peak , one can hope to obtain stronger constraints on @xmath4 and @xmath3 very soon .",
    "of course , another observable which can also be used is the matter density power spectrum . we will compare the predictions of our model for different cosmologies with the result of recent observations below .",
    "the model we are studying here belongs to a class with a broken scale invariant ( bsi ) power spectrum for the matter density .",
    "such a primordial spectrum could also be generated  @xcite during an inflationary era where the inflaton potential is endowed with steps , e.g. , induced by a spontaneous symmetry breaking phase transition .",
    "the main motivation behind this class of models comes from abell / aco galaxy cluster redshift surveys which indicate  @xcite that the matter power spectrum seems to contain large amplitude features close to a scale of @xmath7 ( see however  @xcite ) . in support of this finding",
    "are the preliminary results of the recently released  @xcite power spectrum analysis of the redshift surveys of quasi - stellar objects ( qsos ) . using the 10k catalogue from the 2df qso redshift survey  @xcite ,",
    "it has been tentatively identified  @xcite a `` spike '' feature at a scale @xmath8mpc ( @xmath9mpc ) assuming a lambda contribution @xmath10 and an ordinary matter contribution @xmath11 ( respectively , @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) .",
    "provided this feature is confirmed , it might also have originated from acoustic oscillations in the tightly - coupled baryon - radiation fluid prior to decoupling . using the cmbfast code",
    "it was found  @xcite that this spike in the spectrum is seen at a @xmath14 per cent smaller wavenumber than the second acoustic peak , while higher values of the baryon contribution @xmath15 may be needed to fit the amplitude of this feature .",
    "if we interpret this feature as originating from the primordial spectrum then , in order to be consistent with observations , the preferred scale @xmath16 must lie way below the horizon today , possibly at a scale corresponding to the turn of the power spectrum  @xcite or at the scale matching the first acoustic peak of the cmb temperature anisotropies  @xcite .",
    "one then sees that the presently available data already restricts the parameter space for the quantities @xmath16 and @xmath3  @xcite .    for the class of models which contain a preferred scale ,",
    "a generic prediction is that the three - point correlation function vanishes ( as well as any higher - order odd - point function ) , whereas the four - point ( as well as any higher - order even - point ) correlation function no longer satisfies the relation @xmath17 which is typical of gaussian statistics .",
    "since the third - order moment ( the skewness ) vanishes , a first step is to calculate the fourth - order statistics ( the kurtosis ) .",
    "it is interesting to perform this calculation for very large ( cobe - size ) angular scales , for which one can be confident that the source of non - gaussianity is primordial . on the other hand , if the non - gaussian signature was calculated on intermediate scales , a stronger signal would be obtained ; however , in that case the secondary sources would be more difficult to subtract and thus the transparency of the effect would be compromised . to quantify the relevant amplitude of the signal ,",
    "the excess kurtosis should be compared with its cosmic variance .",
    "this was computed , e.g. , in ref .",
    "@xcite , for a gaussian field .",
    "although , strictly speaking , one should compute the cosmic variance for the actual case and not rely on a mildly non - gaussian analysis , the actual smallness of the obtained signal largely justifies our approach .",
    "we organize the rest of the paper as follows : in section ii , we discuss in detail the argument developed in ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the back - reaction problem .",
    "we show that any theory with a non - vacuum initial state has to face this issue .",
    "however , we also argue that it is not clear at all whether inflation will be prevented in this context . in section iii",
    ", we discuss our choice of a non - vacuum initial state for cosmological perturbations of quantum - mechanical origin and we give some basic formulas for the two - point function .",
    "we calculate the cmb angular correlation function and the associated matter power - spectrum for our choice of non - vacuum initial states , comparing the latter against current observations . in section iv",
    ", we calculate the angular four - point correlation function and the related cmb excess kurtosis , while in section v we discuss our results explicitly and present both analytical and full numerical estimates of the normalized excess kurtosis for a typical case . in this section",
    "we also compare this non - gaussian signal with its corresponding cosmic variance .",
    "we round up with our conclusions in section vii . in this paper",
    ", we use units such that @xmath18 .",
    "in this section we discuss the relevance of non - vacuum initial states for cosmological quantum perturbations . the argument of ref .",
    "@xcite is based on the calculation of the energy density of the perturbed inflaton scalar field in a given non - vacuum initial state . since the perturbed inflaton and the bardeen potential",
    "are linked through the einstein equations , it is clear that they should be placed in the same quantum state . let us consider a quantum scalar field living in a ( spatially flat ) friedmann  lematre  roberston  walker background .",

    "we get @xmath35 several comments are in order at this point .",
    "firstly , the lower limit of the integral is certainly not zero because at some fixed time , @xmath36 corresponds to modes outside the horizon .",
    "so if we evaluate the previous integral at time @xmath37 then we should only integrate over those modes whose wavelength is smaller than the hubble radius .",
    "but in the infra - red sector , the integral is finite and so the contributions of those modes will be small .",
    "therefore , in practice we can keep a vanishing lower bound .",
    "secondly , the first term of each expression is the contribution of the vacuum , i.e. , is present even if @xmath38 .",
    "this is clearly divergent in the ultra - violet regime . at this point",
    ", one should adopt a regularization procedure ( in curved space - time ) .",
    "once this infinite vacuum contribution is subtracted out , our renormalized expressions for the density and pressure in the @xmath39 state read @xmath40 for a well - behaved distribution function @xmath28 this result is finite .",
    "thirdly , the perturbed inflaton ( scalar ) particles behave as radiation , as clearly indicated by the equation of state @xmath41 and as could have been guessed from the beginning since the scalar field studied is free . to go further , we need to specify the function @xmath28 .",
    "if we assume that the distribution @xmath28 is peaked around a value @xmath4 , it can be approximated by a constant distribution of n quanta , with @xmath42 , in the interval @xmath43 $ ] centered around @xmath16 .",
    "if the interval is not too large , i.e. @xmath44 then , at first order in @xmath45 , we get @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of @xmath48-folds _ counted back _ from the time of exit , see fig  [ breac ] .",
    "the time of exit is determined by the condition @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "it is simply related to the scale of inflation , @xmath51 , by the relation @xmath52 .",
    "we have also assumed that , during inflation , the scale factor behaves as @xmath53 . from eq .",
    "( [ rhoper ] ) , we see that the back - reaction problem occurs when one goes back in time since the energy density of the quanta scales as @xmath54 . in this case , the number of e - folds @xmath47 increases and the quantity @xmath55 raises .",
    "this calculation is valid as long as @xmath56 .",
    "when these two quantities are equal , the energy density of the fluctuations is equal to the energy density of the background and the linear theory breaks down .",

    "this means that for each scale considered separately , the back - reaction problem starts to be important after the same number of e - folds @xmath60 counted back from horizon exit ( this is why in fig .",
    "[ breac ] , one has @xmath61 for the two different scales @xmath62 and @xmath63 ) .",
    "if , for instance , we consider the case where inflation takes place at gut scales , @xmath64 , then @xmath65 and one obtains @xmath66 in agreement with the estimates of ref .  @xcite . if the distribution @xmath28 is not strongly peaked around a particular scale but is rather spread over a large interval , it is clear that the important mode of the problem is , very roughly speaking , the populated smallest scale ( i.e. @xmath67 in fig .",
    "[ breac ] ) . in the following ,",
    "this scale is denoted by @xmath68 .",
    "the value of this scale clearly depends upon the form of the distribution @xmath28 . as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ breac ] , @xmath68 is the scale for which the back - reaction problem shows up first , as we go backward in time , since the other modes with larger wavelengths have not yet penetrated deeply into the horizon and therefore do not yet face a back - reaction problem . as a consequence , this scale determines the total number of e - folds during inflation without a back - reaction problem .",
    "once the number @xmath69 has been calculated , the total number of e - folds during inflation without a back - reaction problem is _ a priori _ fixed .",
    "it remains to be checked whether this number is still sufficient to solve the usual problems of the hot big bang model .",
    "we now turn to this question .",
    "let @xmath70 be the number of e - folds , for a given scale @xmath71 , between horizon exit during inflation and the beginning of the radiation era , see fig .",

    "it is linked to the reheating temperature by the relation @xmath97 .",
    "this gives a constraint on the scale of inflation , namely @xmath98 it is known that inflation can take place between the tev scale and the planck scale which amounts to @xmath99 .",
    "we see that the constraint given by eq .",
    "( [ cons ] ) is not too restrictive . in particular ,",
    "if we take @xmath100 and @xmath101 , it is satisfied .",
    "however , if we decrease the scale @xmath68 , the constraint becomes more restrictive .",
    "the constraint derived in the present article appears to be less restrictive than in ref .",
    "@xcite because we do not assume that all scales are populated .",
    "another condition must be taken into account .",
    "we have seen that the duration of inflation without a back - reaction problem is determined by the evolution of @xmath68 .",
    "however , at the time at which the back - reaction problem shows up , one must also check that all the scales of astrophysical interest today were inside the horizon so that physically meaningful initial conditions can be chosen .",
    "this property is one of the most important advantages of the inflationary scenario .",
    "if we say that the largest scale of interest today is the horizon , this condition is equivalent to @xmath102 this condition is also not very restrictive , especially for large scales . as previously",
    ", the condition can be more restrictive of one wants to populate smaller scales .    before concluding this section ,",
    "a last comment is in order .",
    "what is actually shown above is that , roughly @xmath69 e - folds before the relevant mode left the horizon , we face a back - reaction problem , as the energy density of the perturbation @xmath103 becomes of the same order of magnitude as the background @xmath104 .",
    "so , before concluding that non - vacuum initial states may or may not turn off the inflationary phase , one should calculate the back - reaction effect , i.e. , extend the present framework to second order as it was done in ref .",
    "@xcite . to our knowledge , this analysis is still to be performed .",
    "moreover , even if we take the most pessimistic position , that is , one in which we assume that the back - reaction of the perturbations on the background energy density prevents the inflationary phase , there still exist models of inflation where the previous difficulties do not show up .",
    "therefore , in the most pessimistic situation , there is still a hope to reconcile non - vacuum initial states with inflation .",
    "admittedly , the price to pay is a fine - tuning of the free parameters describing inflation and/or the non - vacuum state .",
    "we now turn to consider the non - vacuum states for the cosmological perturbations of quantum mechanical origin .",
    "let @xmath105 be a domain in momentum space , such that if @xmath106 is between @xmath107 and @xmath108 , the domain @xmath105 is filled by @xmath3 quanta , while otherwise @xmath109 contains nothing .",

    "therefore , as the excess kurtosis is essentially given by the large scale part of @xmath228 , it must be independent of @xmath4 provided that @xmath4 is large , exactly as we find . on the other hand , if @xmath4 is small , a change in this scale affects the structure of the state at scales that are relevant for the sachs - wolfe effect . as we saw previously , in this regime , the number of quanta corresponding to large scales decreases as @xmath4 goes to zero .",
    "the result is that the excess kurtosis , whose value is directly dependent on the number of quanta , should diminish proportionally as @xmath4 goes to zero , and this is in fact what we see in fig .",

    "the normalized excess kurtosis is defined in eq .",
    "( [ defq ] ) .",
    "we see that , in the present context , we face two important complications .",
    "the first one is that one has to perform the minimization in a non - vacuum state .",
    "let us notice in passing that this implies that the cosmic variance of the multipole moments is probably not given by the usual expression if the quantum state is no longer the vacuum .",
    "the second complication is that , in order to determine the best estimator of the normalized excess kurtosis , one has to deal with the ratio of two stochastic processes .",

    "the problem is that @xmath482 . in this case",
    ", the calculation of the best estimator becomes much more complicated .",
    "therefore , the full calculation of the best estimator of the normalized excess kurtosis is a project beyond the scope of the present work and we will instead limit ourselves to an order - of - magnitude estimate of the theoretical uncertainties .",
    "this will yield a roughly correct estimate of the uncertainties without the complications of much more cumbersome analysis .    to avoid the first complication",
    ", we estimate the variance of the excess kurtosis as if it were issued from a gaussian process , i.e. , as if the quantum state were the vacuum state . to deal with the second complication",
    ", we use the following procedure . the excess kurtosis @xmath359 ( or its normalized version @xmath361 )",
    "is just related to the fourth moment @xmath357 of the distribution from which we substract the gaussian part @xmath483 .",
    "we will only take into account the contribution to the cosmic variance related to the fourth moment @xmath484 .",
    "this last one is determined in the standard manner : the quantity @xmath485 , defined in eq .",

    "having specified the cosmic variance of the kurtosis , we now need to relate it to the cosmic variance of the excess kurtosis .",
    "the effect of the cosmic variance is that , instead of finding the value @xmath489 for a gaussian process in the vacuum state , we typically obtain a value shifted by @xmath490 which can be estimated as @xmath491 where in the last equality , and as we mentioned above , we used the fact that the process is gaussian .",

    "as already mentioned , it has been recently suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite that trans - planckian physics could be mimicked by a non - vacuum state ( rather than by a change in the dispersion relation ) implying that non - gaussianity would be a possible observable signature of the physics on lengths much smaller than the planck length .",
    "unfortunately , what has been shown in the present paper for the cmb excess kurtosis leads us to conclude with a no - go conjecture : these aforementioned signatures of trans - planckian physics will most probably be astrophysically unobservable .",
