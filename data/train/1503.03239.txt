    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the cell center of cell @xmath11 and the @xmath12 time level respectively then a conservative numerical approximation for ( [ nonlin ] ) can be defined by @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the numerical flux function defined at the cell interface @xmath16 at time level @xmath17 .",
    "the characteristics speed @xmath18 associated with ( [ nonlin ] ) can be approximated as , @xmath19 where @xmath20 . in general",
    "due to non - linearity of ( [ nonlin ] ) , beyond a small finite time , even for a smooth initial data the evolution of discontinuities in the solution @xmath0 is inevitable .",
    "therefore , it is required to have a conservative approximation of the solution with high accuracy and crisp resolution of such discontinuities with out numerical oscillations .",
    "contrary to this need , most classical high order schemes despite of being linearly von - neumann stable give oscillatory approximation for discontinuities even for the trivial case of transport equation i.e. , @xmath21 . such oscillatory approximation can not be considered as admissible solution since it violets the following global maximum principle satisfied by the physically correct solution @xmath0 of ( [ nonlin ] ) i.e. , @xmath22 in order to overcome these undesired numerical instabilities , various notion of non - linear stability are developed in the light of maximum principle ( [ mp ] ) .",
    "examples of maximum principle satisfying schemes are monotone schemes @xcite , total variation diminishing ( tvd ) schemes @xcite .",
    "some uniformly high order maximum - principle satisfying and positivity preserving schemes are @xcite .",
    "there are other non - oscillatory schemes which do not strictly follow maximum principle but practically give excellent numerical results e.g. , essentially non - oscillatory ( eno ) and weighted eno schemes see @xcite and references therein .",
    "it is known that among global maximum principle satisfying schemes , the monotone and total variation diminishing ( tvd ) schemes experience difficulties at data extrema . on the one hand ,",
    "such high order schemes locally degenerate to first order accuracy at non - sonic data extrema and on the other hand , even such a uniformly first order accurate schemes may exhibit induced local oscillations at data extrema . in this work",
    "the focus is on the construction of improved tvd schemes at smooth data extrema .",
    "the above global maximum principle ( [ mp ] ) satisfying monotone and tvd schemes have been of great interest mainly due to excellent convergence proofs for entropy solution @xcite and @xcite respectively .",
    "the key idea is , any maximum principle satisfying scheme produce a bounded solution sequence and convergence follows due to compactness of solution sequence space @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that monotone stable scheme @xmath23 tvd scheme @xmath23 monotonicity preserving scheme ( or local extremum diminishing ( led ) ) scheme @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , monotone as well tvd schemes experience difficulty at data extrema .",
    "the monotone stability relies on monotone data and therefore a monotone scheme preserves the monotonicity of a data set by mapping it to a new monotone data set but fails to preserve the non - monotone solution region i.e. , at data extrema .",
    "these monotone schemes are criticized mainly due to barrier theorem which state that a linear three point monotone scheme can be at most first order accurate @xcite .",
    "later , second order non - linear conservative monotone schemes are constructed using limiters but again by compromising on second order accuracy at extrema , e.g. @xcite .",
    "the tvd stability mimics the maximum principle as it relies on the condition that global extremum values of solution must remain be bounded by global extremum values of initial solution . in @xcite , harten gave the concept of total variation diminishing scheme by measuring the variation of the grid values as follows    [ def1 ] conservative scheme ( [ s2eq2 ] ) is called total variation diminishing if @xmath24 where @xmath25 .    note",
    "that that the definition [ def1 ] is global as it is defined on the whole computational domain and ensures that global maxima or minima of initial solution @xmath26 will not increase or decrease respectively .",
    "such conservative tvd schemes are heavily criticized because , even if they are higher order accurate in most solution region , they give up second order of accuracy at non - sonic critical values of the solution @xcite .",
    "_ we emphasize that these depressing results on degeneracy of accuracy of tvd method are given for * conservative * schemes and in the above * global sense*_. more precisely the global nature of tvd definition ( [ tvddef ] ) allows shift in indices technique in @xmath27 sign and is extensively used in different terms of the infinite sums in the tvd proofs of various schemes and results in the literature including the following one due to harten @xcite .",

    "@xcite      in @xcite , proof for degeneracy to first order accuracy at non - sonic critical points of solution i.e. , points @xmath30 s.t .",
    "@xmath31 is mainly based on modified equation analysis and a _ conservative _ semi - discrete version of lemma [ lem1 ] . in @xcite , using a trade off between second order accuracy and tvd requirement along with shift in indices technique , it is shown that second order accuracy must be given up by a _ conservative _ tvd scheme at non sonic critical values @xmath32 which corresponds to extreme values i.e. , @xmath33.[u(x_{i},t)-u(x_{i}-\\delta\\,x , t)]<0 \\neq f^{'}(u_{i})$ ] .",
    "it is also worthy to note that problem of degenerate accuracy by modern high resolution tvd schemes is also due to their construction procedure .",
    "for example , the numerical flux function of flux limiters or slope limiters based tvd schemes is essentially design in such a way that it reduces to first order accuracy at extrema and high gradient region by forcing limiter function to be zero see @xcite and references therein .",
    "this makes it impossible for a limiter based tvd schemes to achieve higher than first order accuracy at solution extrema as well at steep gradient region @xcite .",
    "thus every high order tvd ( in global sense ( [ tvddef ] ) ) scheme suffers from clipping error and cause flatten approximation for smooth extrema though they sharply capture discontinuities@xcite .",
    "apart from compromise in uniform high accuracy , it is notable that global maximum principle satisfying monotone and tvd schemes do not necessarily ensure preservation of non - monotone data set i.e. , for a data set with extrema as demonstrated in figure [ f1a](b ) .",
    "in particular first order monotone and tvd schemes with * large coefficient of numerical viscosity * can allow the occurrence of induced oscillations at data extrema and formation of new local extremum values as shown in figure [ f1b](a ) .",
