    "the output parameters of ` nbody6++ ` ( aarseth 1999 ) simulations are mostly theoretical values . to make a direct comparison between n - body simulation data and observations , we combine galev ( galaxy evolutionary synthesis models ; kotulla et al . 2009 ) , a flexible algorithm to combine astrophysical colors in many filters and spectra of stars ( lejeune , cuisinier & buser 1997 , 1998 ) or sets of stars , with ` nbody6++ ` simulations . in this paper",
    ", we present the structure of this new code : galevnb ( galev for n - body simulations ) . adapting subroutines from galev",
    ", galevnb can produce spectra spans the range from far - uv at 90@xmath0 to far ir at 160@xmath2 m , with a spectral resolution of 20@xmath0 in the uv - optical and 50 - 100@xmath0 in the near ir range .",
    "given a list of requested filters in hst , eso , sdss , 2mass etc .",
    ", galevnb convolves the spectra with the filter response functions and applies the chosen zero - points ( vegamag , abmag , and stmag ) to yield absolute magnitudes .",
    "galevnb bridges theoretical parameters and their observed values , thus allows us to understand the color and spectra evolution of star clusters , and to determine the initial conditions and parameters of star cluster simulations with a direct comparison to observations .",
    "the main program of galevnb is ` galevnb.f90 ` , which parses single snapshot files ( stellar evolution only ) generated by ` nbody6++ ` / ` nbody6 ` .",
    "it uses seven subroutines ( ` startomaginit ` , ` specint_initialize ` , ` reset_weights ` , ` startomag ` , ` add_star ` , ` spec2mag ` , ` spec_output ` ) of galev package to convert effective temperature , stellar luminosity , metallicity , and mass into observational magnitudes and spectra .",
    "the functions of these routines are presented in table 1 .",
    "the galevnb package contains four folders : 1 ) ` spectral_templates ` , in which locate all the spectral template files from the basel library of model atmospheres ( lejeune , cuisinier & buser 1997 , 1998 ) ; 2 ) ` standard_filters ` , contains a large set of filter response functions ( fuv , nuv , u , b , v , r , i , j , h , k ) that are used as standard reference filters ; 3 ) ` filter_response_curves ` , includes filter response functions from magnitude systems of hst , eso instruments , 2mass , sdss , johnson , and cousins in separate subfolders .",
    "we also provide a choice of user - specify filter response functions .",
    "information about the entire set of available filters is included in the file ` filterlist.dat ` .",
    "please aware that ` filterlist.dat ` , in which the user specify their own choice of magnitude system by uncommenting the line of chosen filter , must be presented in the same directory as the ` nbody6++ ` / ` nbody6 ` snapshot files .",
    "the content of the file , ` filterlist.dat ` , is presented in table 2 .    to compile galevnb",
    ", the user should have c++ and fortran installed .",
    "the input file of galevnb should be a sinlge snapshot output from ` nbody6++ ` / ` nbody6 ` simulations . in case of a file containing all snapshots ( called ` sev.83 ` in ` nbody6++ ` and ` fort.83 ` in ` nbody6 ` ) , we provide the user with a shell script ` generate_snapshots.sh ` in the folder , ` scripts ` , for retrieving single snapshot data out of ` sev.83 ` and ` fort.83 ` .",
    "the user can select his / her preferred filters ( maximum 20 ) by uncommenting the row of the corresponding filter in ` filterlist.dat ` , and choose his / her desired magnitude system ( table 2 ) .",
    "magnitudes of individual stars and the whole cluster , and spectra of the cluster or chosen stellar types are produced , respectively .",
