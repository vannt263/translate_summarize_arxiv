    "inertia gravity ( ig ) waves , resulting from the rotating and stratified nature of geophysical fluids , play an important role in atmosphere - ocean dynamics @xcite .",
    "a broad overview of their properties with relevance to the ocean can be found in garrett & munk @xcite , and a recent review focussing on the observational characterization of the oceanic wave - field can be found in polzin and lvov @xcite .",
    "the general dynamics of these waves are reviewed by sommeria & staquet @xcite .",
    "further , wunsch & ferrari @xcite place these waves in context when considering the general circulation of the ocean , while fritts & alexander @xcite review their influence on diverse phenomena in the middle atmosphere .",
    "+ in their influential papers , garrett & munk @xcite,@xcite pointed out the importance of a deeper understanding of the dynamics of the ig wave modes . in this",
    "regard , one avenue of progress has been to focus upon the subset of resonant interactions among these waves @xcite . in general , the dispersive nature of the linear waves results in reduced nonlinear transfer between modes by dispersive phase scrambling .",
    "however , resonant interactions are special nonlinear interactions for which phase scrambling is absent , and nonlinear transfer remains strong . thus resonant interactions are critical for the dynamics when they are present .",
    "see for example @xcite for a broad introduction to nonlinear dispersive equations , @xcite for statistical theories of the so - called weak turbulence , @xcite , @xcite for geophysical perspectives and @xcite,@xcite for the roles of resonances and near - resonances in the specific case of the 3d rotating boussinesq system .",
    "+ investigating resonant ig waves , mccomas & bretherton @xcite distinguished between three classes of resonant interactions that lead to induced diffusion , elastic scattering and parametric sub - harmonic instability . the picture put forth was , for a large - scale initial data : ( i ) elastic scattering leads to 3d isotropy of an initial condition that is only horizontally isotropic , ( ii ) sub - harmonic instability moves energy downscale , ( iii ) induced diffusion tends to force the high wavenumber spectrum towards equilibrium .",
    "a detailed account of these resonances can be found in the extensive review by muller et al .",
    "@xcite ; their review also describes approaches that account for more than resonant interactions , but involve other approximations ( such as the direct interaction approximation ) .",
    "further , the use of resonances to derive kinetic equations under the weak turbulence paradigm has been an active area of work  for an overview see lvov et  al .",
    "in particular recent work has shown a correspondence between observed ig energy spectra and particular steady state solutions of the relevant kinetic equations @xcite,@xcite .",
    "+ unfortunately , as was pointed out by mccomas & bretherton @xcite , resonances do not account for the bulk of interactions among ig waves .",
    "a formal statement regarding the sparsity of these resonances can be found in babin et  al .",
    "this is all the more an important issue when @xmath18 are small ( implying strong rotation and stratification ) but far from zero , i.e.  @xmath19 ( where @xmath18 are the rossby and froude numbers respectively ) . indeed , having non - zero @xmath5 and/or @xmath6 opens the door for near - resonances to enter the dynamics and these interactions can , both quantitatively and qualitatively , change the behavior of the system @xcite .",
    "this naturally motivates the construction of a model ( called the ggg model ) that includes all possible wave - mode interactions . quite interestingly ,",
    "as the two - dimensional ( 2d ) stratified boussinesq system only supports wave modes , this new 3d system can be looked upon as an extension of the full 2d stratified problem @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "+ so far , our discussion has been restricted to considering wave modes in isolation . in reality rotating and stratified fluids",
    "support an additional vortical mode of motion @xcite , and in fact in geophysically relevant limits , interactions among vortical modes lead to the celebrated quasigeostrophic ( qg ) equations @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . indeed , one of the many contributions by prof .",
    "majda ( in collaboration with prof .",
    "p.  embid ) in the field of geophysical fluid dynamics concerns a formal statement on the emergence of qg dynamics , from the governing rotating boussinesq equations , in the limit @xmath20 while holding @xmath21 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "in addition to clarifying the nature of the qg equations and constructing a general framework for averaging over fast - modes in geophysical systems @xcite , their work also predicted the emergence of a new regime , the so - called vertically sheared horizontal flows ( vshf ) when @xmath22 while @xmath23 @xcite,@xcite .",
    "since then , numerical work in the appropriate parameter regime has confirmed the emergence of vshf modes when considering a rotating boussinesq fluid under random forcing @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite . +",
    "as it happens , the vortical mode plays an important role in the redistribution of wave - mode energy by means of the so - called wave - vortical - wave interactions .",
    "in fact , this is thought to be the primary manner in which energy is transferred from large to small scales in rotating and stratified flows , and is attributed to be the fundamental mechanism behind geostrophic adjustment @xcite .",
    "further , in both decaying and forced scenarios , numerical simulations of rapidly rotating and strongly stratified ( i.e.  small @xmath18 ) flows have shown the equilibration of wave modes ( by means of the aforementioned forward transfer ) while energy continues to be transferred upscale in the vortical modes via vortical - vortical - vortical ( qg ) interactions @xcite,@xcite . for @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 are the coriolis parameter and the brunt - visl frequency ) in a unit aspect ratio ,",
    "the wave modes are passively driven by the vortical modes .",
    "for this case @xmath24 , there are no wave - wave - wave resonances ( or near - resonances ) , and the distribution of energy among the wave modes is strongly influenced by the presence of the vortical mode @xcite,@xcite .",
    "of course , in the atmosphere - ocean system @xmath26 , leading to the possibility of near and exact wave - wave - wave resonances , though as stated earlier these sets of interactions are sparse @xcite . all in all , this line of reasoning leads one to believe that the vortical mode should in fact play a significant role in determining the wave - mode energy distribution . +",
    "these scenarios then lead to a somewhat dichotomous state of affairs with regard to ig wave - mode energy , i.e.on one hand we have theories based on the interactions of ig modes in isolation . on the other hand , there is reason to attribute a prominent role to the vortical mode in the overall dynamics of a rotating and stratified fluid , which includes the distribution of energy among the wave modes themselves .",
    "this dichotomy  in the context of purely stratified flows  has been pointed out and investigated by waite & bartello @xcite . by forcing only wave modes of the boussinesq system",
    ", they inquired into the turbulence generated by a stratified fluid .",
    "their principal conclusion was to highlight the importance of the vortical mode in mediating wave - mode energy transfer and distribution .",
    "further , they noted the difficulty in properly resolving wave - mode interactions @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "in addition to studying the full boussinesq equations , we derive a model that consists of only wave - mode interactions , which in principle provides the means for determining the relative importance of wave - vortical - wave and wave - wave - wave interactions for the distribution of wave - mode energy . specifically , by simulating the newly derived ggg model , we attempt to see if this system is capable of a robust forward transfer of energy , and compare the energy spectra of wave modes from the ggg model to the corresponding wave mode spectra that arise from simulations of the full rotating - stratified boussinesq system . we proceed to introduce the basic equations , review the possible means of wave mode evolution and derive the ggg model .",
    "we then describe the numerical setup and proceed to the simulations of this system .",
    "finally , we collect and discuss the results .",
    "the rotating boussinesq equations in a 3d periodic setting are @xcite    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the 3d velocity field , @xmath29 is a scaled pressure and @xmath30 is the coriolis parameter with rotation assumed to be aligned with the @xmath31-axis .",
    "equations ( [ 1 ] ) result from considering periodic perturbations to a state of hydrostatic balance wherein the density profile satisfies @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "further , we have set @xmath34 where @xmath35",
    ". finally , @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the viscosity and diffusivity respectively .",
    "+ linearizing ( [ 1 ] ) about a state of rest , substituting solutions of the form @xmath38 one finds    @xmath39    here @xmath40 is the magnitude of the wave - vector and @xmath41 .",
    "modes corresponding to @xmath42 are the ig waves ( referred to as wave modes ) , while the mode corresponding to @xmath43 is referred to as the vortical ( or geostrophic ) mode @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . denoting the eigenfunctions corresponding to @xmath44 by @xmath45 respectively",
    ", it is known that these eigenfunctions are mutually orthogonal and form a complete basis ( see embid & majda @xcite , @xcite and smith & waleffe @xcite for details ) .",
    "this enables us to project a fourier expansion of the solution to ( [ 1 ] ) onto this eigenfunction basis , i.e.  projections of the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the state vector , @xmath48 @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "symbolically this yields    @xmath49    where @xmath50 represents a sum over @xmath51 such that @xmath52 .",
    "the indices @xmath53 run over @xmath54 and @xmath55 is the interaction coefficient .",
    "the exact form of the interaction coefficients is not emphasized here , but it is helpful in our discussion to think in terms of the following symmetric definition @xmath56 where @xmath57 contains the first three components of @xmath58 corresponding to the velocity entries and @xmath59 denotes complex - conjugate .",
    "notice that , with this symmetric definition , @xmath60 ; the coefficient @xmath55 involves the advection of the mode corresponding to @xmath61 by the mode corresponding to @xmath62 and vice versa . in the following , a triplet @xmath63 refers to a particular type of triad interaction , and a @xmath64 refers to a vortical mode while a @xmath65 refers to a wave mode ( either a @xmath66 or a @xmath67 mode ) .",
    "for example , @xmath68 ( with all permutations implied ) represents all possible interactions between two wave modes and one vortical mode .",
    "an alternate way to represent the expansion is @xmath69 + b_+({\\bf k},t)\\phi_+({\\bf k})\\exp[-{\\rm i}\\sigma_+({\\mathbf{k}})t]+ b_-({\\bf k},t)\\phi_-({\\bf k})\\exp[-{\\rm i}\\sigma_-({\\mathbf{k}})t]$ ] . in this case (",
    "[ 3 ] ) takes the form    @xmath70~t\\ } \\label{3a}\\ ] ]    which shows the influence of the dispersion on the advective nonlinearity .",
    "indeed , it is now possible to construct a dynamical hierarchy consisting of ( i ) resonances , i.e.@xmath71 , ( ii ) near - resonances , i.e.  @xmath72 where @xmath73 and ( iii ) non - resonant interactions , i.e.  @xmath74 . in this hierarchy",
    "it is postulated that resonances are always important , near - resonances play a role when @xmath75 i.e.  rotation and stratification are strong , but we are outside limiting scenarios where @xmath76 .",
    "finally , for rapid rotation and strong stratification , non - resonant interactions are only expected to contribute at higher - orders ( in @xmath77 ) .",
    "while it is not possible for non - resonant interactions to lead to qualitatively different behavior as compared to near - resonances , we note that near - resonances open up pathways that are precluded under resonance ( for details see sukhatme & smith @xcite ) .",
    "an explicit example of such a qualitative change induced by near - resonant interactions is provided via cyclonic - anticyclonic asymmetry in rotating flows @xcite .",
    "other examples , such as the influence on the statistical features of water waves and capillary wave generation may be found in annenkov & shrira @xcite , and watson & buschbaum @xcite , respectively .",
    "+ considering only resonant and near - resonant interactions , the wave modes can only evolve via the @xmath68 and @xmath78 classes ( see bartello @xcite or sukhatme & smith @xcite for a detailed view of wave and vortical mode evolution ) . when @xmath79 the @xmath78 ( near ) resonant interactions are absent and  within this dynamical hierarchy ",
    "the distribution of wave - mode energy is determined by @xmath68 , indicating the crucial role played by the vortical mode .",
    "further , it was shown by bartello @xcite , that purely resonant @xmath68 interactions are catalytic in that they involve the exchange of energy among two wave modes by using the vortical mode as a catalyst .",
    "this leads to the elegant result that when @xmath24 the wave modes are passively driven by the vortical mode @xcite ( this follows as near - resonances are not possible for a rapidly rotating and strongly stratified fluid when @xmath24 @xcite ) .",
    "of course , in the most general case we lift the restriction @xmath79 . as both @xmath68 and @xmath78",
    "are viable means of affecting the wave - mode energy distribution , it is natural to inquire into their nature and importance . specifically , given the formal sparsity of @xmath78 interactions @xcite , are @xmath68 always dominant ?",
    "indeed , do the @xmath78 interactions play any role in the 3d rotating boussinesq system ? also , what is the nature of these interactions , i.e.  do they yield a forward transfer of energy under large - scale forcing ?",
    "if so , do they lead to an equilibration of wave modes and yield a well - defined power spectrum ? to inquire into these questions , we construct a model ( the ggg model ) that includes only wave - mode interactions . in principle , comparing the results from the ggg model with the full rotating boussinesq system should help in settling some of these issues .",
    "we now present the ggg model in physical space and its derivation .",
    "it is useful to first determine the mode amplitudes in terms of the physical variables . towards this goal ,",
    "begin by defining the stream function @xmath80 , the potential function @xmath81 , and the horizontally averaged flows @xmath82 and @xmath83 in the standard way    @xmath84    here @xmath85 denotes a horizontal average .",
    "these definitions imply @xmath86 and @xmath87 . substituting ( [ alternate ] ) for @xmath88 and @xmath64 in the state vector , @xmath47 , ( [ represent ] ) and the orthonormality of the eigenfunctions yields ( please see the appendix for additonal details )    @xmath89    next , notice that by adding @xmath90 and @xmath91 and also subtracting @xmath91 from @xmath90 the physical variables decouple further ,    @xmath92    in fact , it is now clear from ( [ azero1 ] ) and ( [ aplusmaminus1 ] ) that defining    @xmath93    is advantageous since this means @xmath94 in addition @xmath95 and @xmath96 have physical significance : @xmath95 is the linear potential vorticity ( pv ) and @xmath96 is a measure of the geostrophic imbalance .",
    "it is apparent that the vortical modes contain all the linear pv and that the variable @xmath96 is associated with the ig modes @xcite . in the following",
    "it will prove useful to make the following definitions    @xmath97    using these definitions note that ( [ g1 ] ) can be re - arranged in the form    @xmath98    a systematic method to complete the derivation of the ggg model in physical space involves the three equations obtained from ( [ 3 ] ) , one for each @xmath99 ( @xmath54 ) , after retaining only the interactions among the ig modes .",
    "therefore , when @xmath99 is 0 there are no interactions and the right hand side is zero ; whereas , when @xmath99 is @xmath66 or @xmath67 , the right hand side is modified by restricting the sum involving @xmath100 and @xmath101 to run over @xmath66 and @xmath67 only . then in order to substitute in the physical space variables identified with @xmath102 ( above ) , add and subtract the equations corresponding to @xmath99 being @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "finally substitute the physical variables for the mode amplitudes and inverse fourrier transform the equations .",
    "this process involves a fair amount of algebra and relevant details are presented in the appendix . + here , for the sake of brevity",
    ", we present a more illuminating and much shorter derivation .",
    "this is possible now that the appropriate physical space variables corresponding to the vortical modes as well as the ig modes have been identified .",
    "it is convenient to rewrite the original system given by ( [ 1 ] ) in a form that has a separate equation for the time derivative of each of the variables corresponding to the modal amplitudes .",
    "a consistent system of this sort contains a time derivative for @xmath95 corresponding to the vortical modes ( [ azero1 ] ) , and time derivatives for @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath82 , and @xmath83 which all correspond to the ig modes ( see ( [ apluspaminus1],([aplusmaminus1 ] ) and ( [ modevshf1 ] ) ) .",
