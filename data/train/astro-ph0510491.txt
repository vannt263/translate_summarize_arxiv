    "the main properties of the ultraluminous x - ray sources ( ulxs )   huge luminosities ( @xmath1 ) , diversity of x - ray spectra , strong variability , connection with star - forming regions , their surrounding nebulae , were reviewed by @xcite .",
    "ulxs may be supercritical accretion disks observed close to the disk axis in close binaries with a stellar mass black hole or microquasars ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , or they may be intermediate - mass black holes with `` normal '' accretion disks ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible that ulxs are not homogeneous class of objects .",
    "it was suggested originally by @xcite that ss433 being observed close to the jet axis will be extremely bright x - ray source . @xcite",
    "discussed observational properties of face - on ss433-like objects and concluded that they may appear as a new type of extragalactic x - ray sources . here",
    "we continue to develop this idea .",
    "the main difference between ss433 and other known x - ray binaries is highly supercritical and persistent mass accretion rate ( @xmath2 ) onto the relativistic star ( a probable black hole , @xmath3 ) , which has led to the formation of a supercritical accretion disk and the relativistic jets .",
    "ss433 properties were reviewed recently by @xcite .",
    "ss433 is an edge - on system , its total luminosity ( mainly in uv ) is @xmath4 .",
    "a temperature of the source is @xmath5 , a mass loss rate in the wind is @xmath6",
    ". both optical and x - ray jets are well collimated ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "ss433 x - ray luminosity ( the cooling x - ray jets ) is @xmath8 times less than bolometric luminosity , however kinetic luminosity of the jets is very high , @xmath9 .",
    "the jets have to be formed in a funnel in the disk and the disk wind .",
    "supercritical accretion disks simulations ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) show that a wide funnel is formed ( a full opening angle @xmath10 ) close to the black hole .",
    "convection is important in the inner accretion disk outside the funnel walls .",
    "if one adopts for the funnel luminosity , that it is about the same as ss433 bolometric luminosity , @xmath11 , ( @xcite ; @xcite ) and the funnel opening angle @xmath10 , one obtains `` observed '' face - on luminosity of ss433 @xmath12 and expected frequency of such objects @xmath13 per a galaxy like milky way . on the other hand a critical luminosity for a @xmath14 black hole is @xmath15 . at highly supercritical accretion rate",
    "@xmath16 it increases ( the inner disk geometry ) by a factor of @xmath17 .",
    "a doppler boosting factor is not large for ss433 ( @xmath18 ) , it is @xmath19 .",
    "the third factor is the geometrical funneling ( @xmath10 ) , it is @xmath20 .",
    "thus , one may expect a face - on luminosity of such supercritical disk @xmath21 .",
    "a size of ss433 wind photosphere is @xmath22 .",
    "an estimate of the jet photosphere ( @xcite ) , which is a bottom of the wide funnel , gives @xmath23 .",
    "we find that the jet is not transparent down to the black hole horizon .",
    "however , the gas supply to the funnel is very variable due to convection ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite developed a simple model of the funnel ( multicolor funnel , mcf ) to estimate the emerging x - ray spectrum .",
    "they considered both gas pressure dominated , @xmath24 , and radiation pressure dominated , @xmath25 cases .",
    "they based on the observed temperature of the wind photosphere in ss433 and found temperatures of the inner funnel walls ( at a level of @xmath26 ) , @xmath27 between @xmath28 and @xmath29 . below @xmath26 the walls can not be observed .    in fig1",
    "we present mcf energy spectra with different ratios of radiation to gas pressure ( @xmath30 ) at a deepest visible parts of the funnel s walls ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the temperature @xmath31 was adopted .",
    "they are spectra with no radiation losses in the funnel ( @xmath32 ) , and with radiation losses included ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the multicolor disk ( mcd ) spectrum with the same inner temperature @xmath34 is shown for comparison .",
    "a low - temperature break in the mcf spectra appears due to finite length of the funnel .",
    "the jets velocity ( @xmath35 ) in ss433 and its surprising stability suggest line - locking mechanism ( @xcite ) to operate in the funnel .",
    "a photosphere of the funnel s inner walls may radiate absorption spectrum with lc and kc edges of h- and he - like ions .",
    "the mcf model predicts very complex absorption - line spectrum .",
    "fig.1 presents expected absorption line profiles of oviii l@xmath0 and lc transitions",
    ".    the absorption bands should belong to h- and he - like ions of the most abundant heavy elements and should extend from the kc to the k@xmath0 energies of the corresponding ions .",
    "variations of the gas parameters along the funnel   its velocity , density , temperature and volume filling factor ( the collimation )   could make the absorption - line profiles appreciably more complex , necessitating the use of x - ray spectra with high signal / noise ratios in searches for these lines .",
    "the supposition that ulxs are face - on ss433 objects leads to the following predictions : 1 ) we expect typical mcd - like spectra , however the mcf spectra may be more diverse depending on the funnel parameters .",
    "2 ) absorption spectrum with broad and shallow l@xmath0/lc , k@xmath0/kc blends of the most abundant heavy elements .",
    "3 ) temporal variability on time scales @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "4 ) a typical accretion disk power density spectrum at scales @xmath38 .",
    "5 ) very bright uv source ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) is less collimated than x - ray source .",
    "the predicted complexity of the dependence of the absorption - line profiles on the structure of the funnel and mechanisms of acceleration and collimation of the gas in the funnel presents excellent opportunities for direct probing of these structures in supercritical accretion disks and for studies of mechanisms of jet formation .",
    "the radio nebula w50 was produced ( or distorted ) by ss433 jets .",
    "we show w50 in fig.2 together with nebulae surrounging two ulxs in holmbergii and ngc6946 galaxies , which were studied recently by integral - field spectroscopy method ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "w50 contains bipolar nebula with optical filaments located at @xmath41 or @xmath42 from ss433 at places of jets termination .",
    "a total energy of the nebula is @xmath43 ( @xcite ) , which corresponds to the jet kinetic luminosity @xmath44 for 20000 years .",
    "the observed velocity dispersion in the filaments is @xmath45 , however [ nii]/h@xmath0 line ratio coresponds to dispersion @xmath46 .",
    "ss433 is an edge - on system , @xmath47 .",
    "if one takes into account this factor , the velocity dispersion may reach @xmath48 .",
    "ulxs are located frequently in bubble - like nebulae .",
    "new data ( @xcite ) show that the nebulae are expanding with a velocity @xmath49 ( up to @xmath50 ) . in two well - studied ulxs nebulae radial velocity gradients in a high ionisation emission line heii@xmath51 were found .",
    "they are @xmath52 on spatial scale @xmath53 in holmbergii ulx-1 ( @xcite ) , and @xmath54 on a scale @xmath55 in ngc6946 ulx-1 ( @xcite ) . in all cases line ratios",
    "indicate shock ionisation .",
    "this means that the nebulae are powered by the central source , probably via jets activity .",
    "the nebulae in holmbergii and ngc6946 have circle - like features in the line - images . in both cases the radio sources",
    "are shifted to a brighter circle - like feature and in the both cases this part of the nebulae is approaching , the opposite part is receding ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . at some imagination one may conclude that the nebulae around these two ulxs are face - on versions ( @xmath56 ) of the ss433 nebula ."
