    "the superconvergence behavior of discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) and local discontinuous galerkin ( ldg ) @xcite methods has been studied for some years .",
    "some early results can be found in thome s 1997 book @xcite .",
    "later , in @xcite , adjerid et al . showed a @xmath4th superconvergence rate of the dg solution at the downwind - biased radau points for some ordinary differential equations ; in @xcite , celiker and cockburn studied superconvergence of the numerical traces for dg and hybridizable dg methods in solving some steady state problems .",
    "recently , yang and shu investigated superconvergence phenomenon of the dg method for hyperbolic conservation laws @xcite and linear parabolic equations @xcite in the one dimensional setting .",
    "superconvergence properties of dg and ldg methods for hyperbolic and parabolic problems based on fourier approach were studied in @xcite .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for an incomplete list of references . very recently , in @xcite , we studied superconvergence properties of a dg method for linear hyperbolic equations when upwind fluxes were used .",
    "we proved a @xmath1th superconvergence rate of the dg approximation at the downwind points ( on average ) as well as the domain average under suitable initial discretization .",
    "the current work is the second in a series to study superconvergence phenomena of the dg method in solving partial differential equations where parabolic equations are under concern .",
    "our main result is a rigorous mathematical proof of the @xmath1th ( or @xmath2th ) superconvergence rate for the domain average and numerical fluxes at mesh nodes . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "the best rate proved so far in the literature is @xmath4 @xcite . as a by - product",
    ", we also prove a point - wise @xmath4th superconvergence rate for the function value approximation and @xmath3th superconvergence rate for the derivative approximation at the radau ( left or right ) points . by doing so ,",
    "we paint a full picture for superconvergence properties of the ldg method for liner parabolic equations in one space dimension .    in order to establish the @xmath1th superconvergence rate ,",
    "some new analysis tools are needed .",
    "at the core of our analysis here is the construction of a correction function , which is super - close to the ldg solution .",
    "the correction function idea has been successfully applied to finite element methods ( fem ) and finite volume methods ( fvm ) for elliptic equations ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , and more recently , to the ldg method for hyperbolic equations @xcite .",
    "however , the construction for parabolic equations is very different from steady state problems using finite element @xcite or finite volume methods @xcite due to the time dependent effects .",
    "moreover , it is also quite different from the ldg method for hyperbolic equations @xcite due to the interplay between two correction functions .",
    "the main difficulty for parabolic equations lies in that correction functions for both variables ( the exact solution @xmath5 and an auxiliary variable @xmath6 ) have to be constructed simultaneously . to be more precise",
    ", we shall correct the error between the exact solution @xmath7 and its gauss - radau projection @xmath8 or @xmath9 , depending on the choice of numerical fluxes .",
    "the construction not only is more complicated than that of hyperbolic equations , but also requires a novel idea to match the two variables .    with help of the correction functions",
    ", we prove that the ldg solution @xmath10 is super - close with order @xmath1 to our specially constructed interpolation function @xmath11 ( defined in section 3 ) . it is this super - closeness that leads to the @xmath1th superconvergence rate for the numerical fluxes at all nodes ( on average ) and for the domain average .    to end this introduction",
    ", we would like to point out that all superconvergent results here are valid for one - dimensional linear systems , and the proof is along the same line without any difficulty .",
    "our analysis also leads to some interesting new numerical discoveries , which will be reported in the last section .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we present the ldg scheme for linear parabolic equations .",
    "section 3 is the most technical part , where we construct some special functions to correct the error between the ldg solution and the gauss - radau projection of the exact solution .",
    "section 4 is the main body of the paper , where superconvergence results are proved with suitable initial discretization . in section 5 , we provide some numerical examples to support our theoretical findings .",
    "finally , some possible future works and concluding remarks are presented in section 6 .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt standard notations for sobolev spaces such as @xmath12 on sub - domain @xmath13 equipped with the norm @xmath14 and semi - norm @xmath15 . when @xmath16 , we omit the index @xmath17 ; and if @xmath18 , we set @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
