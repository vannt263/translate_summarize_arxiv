    "during the past five years , our understanding of the spectrum of d - branes ( both a and b - type ) that appear in type ii compactifications on calabi - yau(cy ) manifolds has significantly improved .",
    "some of the progress has been achieved by relating geometric constructions to non - geometric ones such as lg orbifolds and gepner models .",
    "the first step in this context appeared in the @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the method proposed for b - type d - branes was to analytically continue periods ( identified with the central charge of d - branes ) from non - geometric regions to geometric regions and then use this information to add geometric insight into the story .",
    "this method is rather tedious but it lead the way to a simpler picture for the large - volume analog of the recknagel - schomerus(rs ) boundary states in the gepner model@xcite . from this",
    "emerged a connection with the mckay correspondence@xcite .",
    "the rs boundary states turned out to be restriction of vector bundles or more generally coherent sheaves on the ambient ( weighted ) projective space to the cy hypersurface .",
    "however there are still several important aspects that are unclear and need to be clarified further . among these",
    "is the question of an explicit description of b - type d - branes on calabi - yau manifolds that are not of this type .",
    "a significant recent development in this direction has been the study of b - type d - branes at the landau - ginzburg(lg ) point in the khler moduli space of a calabi - yau manifold . as one might , with hindsight",
    ", have expected from the simplicity of the lg theory , it is indeed possible to provide a fairly explicit description of b - type branes using boundary fermions and the technique of matrix factorization of polynomials@xcite .",
    "this construction follows closely the conjecture of kontsevich regarding the categorical description of b - type branes in the lg theory . in an interesting development",
    "it was shown in @xcite that a new class of fractional branes can in fact be defined in the lg theory .",
    "the d - brane charges of these objects in terms of the charge basis at the large - volume point in khler moduli space have been computed .",
    "interestingly these fractional branes ( in the lg description ) include an object that corresponds at large volume to a single zero brane on the cy manifold .",
    "this is of particular interest since the recknagel - schomerus construction of boundary states in the gepner model for cy manifolds appears to generically miss the d0-brane on the cy manifold .",
    "this d0-brane together with others that are related to it by the quantum symmetry at the lg point are of course only some examples of a large class of new branes that can be constructed using the technique of matrix factorization of the world - sheet superpotential of the lg lagrangian .",
    "this new approach to b - type branes in the lg theory is due to several authors @xcite . for completeness we may mention another major development in this new approach",
    "has been the computation of the world - volume superpotential of such branes@xcite .",
    "we also note that , from a purely mathematical point of view , there have been further developments in the categorical description of these b - type branes at the lg point and the derived equivalence of this category to the derived category of coherent sheaves on the same cy at large volume appears to have been established .",
    "this has been done in a series of papers by orlov @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will investigate the new fractional branes , referred to above , due to ref @xcite , by different methods without using the technique of matrix factorization and the introduction of boundary fermions .",
    "our aim in particular , is to understand these states from a more transparently geometric point of view .",
    "the key observation is that the new fractional branes essentially arise from considering neumann type boundary conditions on the fields of the lg theory . in an earlier",
    "paper@xcite it was observed that there were constraints on how neumann boundary conditions could be imposed on the fields in the lg model in order to describe d - branes .",
    "there was a _ consistency condition _ involving the world - sheet superpotential .",
    "in the quintic we observed , for instance , that neumann boundary conditions could be imposed only on linear combinations of lg fields and not on the individual fields themselves .",
    "this is very similar to the particular matrix factorization that ref .",
    "@xcite ) use in order to construct their new fractional branes .",
    "thus instead of the old fractional branes , which were fractional zero - branes , located at the singular point , we now consider fractional two - branes which are complex lines that pass through the fixed point .",
    "one may easily construct such objects in the orbifold theory without the world - sheet superpotential .",
    "the d - brane charges of these objects in the large volume basis can be computed by first determining the intersection of these fractional two - branes with the fractional zero - branes and with themselves .",
    "this can be easily done at the orbifold point .",
    "subsequently , using these intersection numbers we can determine the large - volume charges of these fractional two - branes .",
    "it turns out that these fractional two - branes have a ` fractional ' first chern class .",
    "this fractional first chern class ensures that when these objects are restricted to the cy hypersurface , one of them precisely becomes a zero - brane on the cy hypersurface .",
    "one may note that if we began with objects that have integer first chern class on the ambient projective space then we would always obtain @xmath1 zero - branes on the cy hypersurface , where @xmath1 is the degree of the polynomial equation describing the cy .",
    "since the appearance of a ` fractional ' first chern class is somewhat surprising , we also show that these fractional two - branes have integer charges if we consider them as objects living in the ambient non - compact cy , which is a line bundle over a projective base , rather than on the projective space itself . in the gauged linear sigma model ( glsm )",
    "description , the true ambient space provided by the fields of the theory is in fact a non - compact cy .",
    "the cy itself comes from first restricting to the ( weighted ) projective space that is the base of the non - compact cy , and then restricting it to the appropriate hypersurface .",
    "we also show that all the boundary states in the ramond sector corresponding to the fractional two - branes can be described using the boundary conditions on the _ bulk _ world - sheet fermions .",
    "it was observed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that this in fact could be done for the fractional zero - branes themselves and in this paper we extend this observation to the new fractional branes .    for definiteness ,",
    "we illustrate our method mainly in the case of the non - compact orbifold @xmath2 , the corresponding cy hypersurface being the elliptic curve given by a degree three equation in @xmath3 .",
    "the extension to the case of the quintic is straightforward .",
    "we note also that these fractional two - branes in non - compact orbifolds were earlier considered by romelsberger@xcite ( for a discussion of the related boundary state construction see also @xcite ) and the appearance of a ` fractional ' first chern class was noted indirectly .",
    "this was explained there by the interplay of the relative homology of the ambient non - compact cy and the compact homology of the base projective space . our description of the fractional two - branes in the ambient non - compact cy provides a clear toric description of the same phenomenon .",
    "in this paper we also note a strong parallel between the relation of the fractional two - branes ( and more generally fractional @xmath0-branes ) in the orbifold theory to the corresponding coherent sheaves at large volume and the notion of the quantum mckay correspondence due to martinec and moore @xcite . while there is nothing quantum about the relation in our setting where space - time supersymmetry is not broken , nevertheless the fractional two - branes in @xmath4 appear closely related to the fractional zero - branes of @xmath5 , the latter being the geometry associated with the non - supersymmetric b - type branes in the work of martinec and moore . in the full set of coherent sheaves that correspond to the quantum @xmath6 orbit of the fractional two - branes at large volume we are able to find the analogues of the so - called ` coulomb branes ' that they describe .",
    "branes , by a different name , possibly as an ` extended mckay correspondence ' .",
    "however in order not to further increase jargon for what is a closely related geometric phenomenon we retain the nomenclature developed in @xcite . ]",
    "finally we also identify the cft description of states of the lg model that correspond to fractional two - brane and four - brane states in the ambient non - compact orbifold that are restricted to the cy hypersurface .",
    "this turns out to be a sub - class of the b - type permutation branes of the gepner models that have been studied earlier@xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows : in section 2 , we discuss the background to the paper and explain the setting of the problem . in particular , we focus on linear boundary conditions in lg orbifolds . using the glsm , section 3",
    "gives a heuristic derivation of the large volume analogs of d - branes for a specific set of boundary conditions in the lg orbifold for the fermat quintic .",
    "we provide evidence that these are indeed the new fractional branes obtained in the first reference@xcite . in section 4 ,",
    "we focus on fractional @xmath0-branes in orbifolds of @xmath4 , in order to better understand the results of section 3 .",
    "we work out a _ master _",
    "formula , eq .",
    "( [ master ] ) , for the intersection forms at the orbifold .",
    "these intersection forms are independently computed in the large volume as well .",
    "the case of @xmath2 is worked out in some detail .",
    "section 5 discusses how , for instance , fractional two - branes in a supersymmetric orbifold @xmath4 are related to fractional zero - branes on a related non - supersymmetric orbifold @xmath7 .",
    "we argue for the existence of a quantum mckay correspondence which relates sheaves associated with fractional @xmath0-branes on @xmath4 to the sheaves associated with tautological bundles for @xmath8-branes on the same orbifold .",
    "section 6 connects our results in the lg orbifold with boundary conformal field theory .",
    "we provide evidence that the fractional two - branes and a certain class of fractional four - branes on restriction to the compact calabi - yau hypersurface are given by a sub - class of the permutation branes constructed in the gepner model@xcite .",
    "we conclude in section 7 with a summary of our results and some comments on unresolved issues .",
    "the appendices have been used to collect several technical results .    while this work was being readied for publication , a paper @xcite appeared and has substantial overlap with the results in section 6 .",
    "consider a gepner model obtained by tensoring of @xmath9 @xmath10 minimal models of level @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "the total central charge of the model is @xmath13    the related lg orbifold is obtained by considering @xmath9 chiral superfields(notation as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath14 with a @xmath15 action ( @xmath16 ) : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is a @xmath19-th root of unity and @xmath20 .",
    "the model has a quasi - homogeneous superpotential given by @xmath21 we will be focusing mainly on the case when @xmath22 for which @xmath23 .",
    "the lg orbifold can be obtained as a ` phase ' of a gauged linear sigma model ( glsm ) by coupling the chiral fields to an abelian vector multiplet as well as another chiral multiplet @xmath24 .",
    "the charges of the @xmath9 chiral multiplets under this @xmath25 are @xmath26 and the chiral multiplet @xmath24 has charge @xmath27 .",
    "the d - term constraint is @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the fayet - iliopoulos(fi ) parameter .",
    "the superpotential in the glsm is taken to be @xmath30 where @xmath31 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ lgpot ] ) .",
    "when @xmath32 , the @xmath33 field is non - zero in the ground state and the @xmath25 is broken to @xmath15 .",
    "further , the fluctuations of the @xmath33 field are massive and can be integrated out to obtain the lg orbifold .",
    "when @xmath34 , not all the @xmath35 can vanish simultaneously and @xmath36 in the ground state .",
    "the @xmath35 become homogeneous coordinates on a weighted projective space @xmath37 $ ] with weights @xmath26 . the equation of motion of the @xmath33 field",
    "imposes the restriction that the fields @xmath35 lie on the hypersurface @xmath38 in @xmath37 $ ] . in the absence of the superpotential ,",
    "one obtains the total space of the line bundle @xmath39 as the moduli space with the @xmath37 $ ] being given by the condition @xmath36 .",
    "i.e. , the zero section of the line bundle .",
    "now consider the lg orbifold on a worldsheet with boundary preserving @xmath40-type supersymmetry .",
    "such boundary conditions were studied in @xcite , where it was shown that linear boundary conditions are specified by a hermitian matrix @xmath40 which squares to identity , @xmath41 and is block diagonal ( it mixes fields with identical charges ) .",
    "the boundary conditions then take the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "the matrices @xmath45 and @xmath46 project onto the neumann and dirichlet directions respectively . the matrix @xmath40 which specifies the boundary conditions needs to satisfy an additional condition due to the presence of the superpotential in the lg model and the block - diagonal nature of @xmath40 implies the condition @xmath38 for quasi - homogeneous superpotentials@xcite : @xmath47 ] @xmath48    in simple models involving a single chiral field",
    ", the only possible condition is the dirichlet one .",
    "this carries over to the case of several chiral superfields when one imposes boundary conditions separately on each of the chiral superfields , i.e. , the matrix @xmath40 is taken to be diagonal . for lg orbifolds associated with gepner models",
    ", this implies that all the boundary states constructed by recknagel and schomerus in @xcite must necessarily arise from dirichlet conditions being imposed on all the chiral superfields .",
    "further , when the superpotential is degenerate at @xmath49 , the condition @xmath38 implies that the rs states arise from the boundary condition @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "based on the results for the @xmath2 orbifold@xcite , it was conjectured in @xcite that the fractional zero - branes on @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 a discrete abelian subgroup of @xmath53 ) correspond at large volume to ( exceptional ) coherent sheaves that provide a natural basis for bundles on the exceptional divisor of the ( possibly partial ) resolution of @xmath51 .",
    "a second conjecture in @xcite was that the rs boundary states ( to be precise , the @xmath54 rs states ) were given by the restriction of the fractional zero - branes to the calabi - yau hypersurface .",
    "substantial evidence for this was provided in refs .",
    "@xcite .    while the exceptional coherent sheaves obtained from fractional zero - branes",
    "do provide a basis for sheaves on the exceptional divisor of the resolution , this does not remain true on restriction to the calabi - yau threefold . for the case of the quintic , one finds that the bundles that are obtained by restriction span an index-25 sub - lattice of the lattice of rr charges of the quintic .",
    "in particular , the zero - brane and two - brane charges appear in multiples of 5 of the smallest possible value@xcite .",
    "this suggests that one must generalise the recknagel - schomerus construction to obtain new boundary states in the gepner model or equivalently consider more general boundary conditions in the lg orbifold . as was explained in the previous subsection",
    ", the rs boundary states correspond to imposing dirichlet boundary conditions on all the fields in the lg orbifold .",
    "it is thus natural to consider boundary conditions that impose neumann boundary conditions on one or more linear combinations of fields as given in eq .",
    "( [ genbc ] ) .",
    "for instance , for the lg orbifold for the superpotential given by the fermat quintic , one such boundary condition is ( see sec .",
    "3.3.3 of @xcite ) @xmath55 it is easy to see that the above boundary conditions satisfy the constraint ( [ superbc ] ) or equivalently that @xmath38 on the boundary .",
    "such branes will be referred to as _ fractional two - branes_. we will see that restriction of one of the fractional two - branes to the quintic hypersurface leads to a zero - brane of minimal charge .",
    "in this section , we will provide a _ heuristic _",
    "derivation of the identity , at large volume , of the d - branes associated with the boundary conditions given in eq .",
    "( [ quinticbc ] ) . as with any heuristic derivation",
    ", we will not provide complete justification but only a motivation for some of the steps involved . nevertheless , at the end of the derivation",
    ", we will have concrete candidates for the identity of the new d - branes .",
    "these new d - branes will be shown to have the same intersection numbers as those of the new fractional branes proposed in @xcite .",
    "we will also provide further justification for the heuristic derivation in the section 4 .",
    "this , we believe , provides _ geometric insight _ into the categorical construction of @xcite in addition to identifying two apparently distinct approaches to d - branes on lg orbifolds . for purposes of illustration",
    ", we first consider the case of the original fractional zero - branes .",
    "as has already been mentioned , the original fractional branes ( to be identified with the recknagel - schomerus states ) are obtained by imposing dirichlet boundary conditions on all fields in the lg orbifold .",
    "this leaves us with _ five _ independent fermionic multiplets on the boundary ( the bulk chiral multiplet splits up into a fermionic multiplet and a chiral multiplet on the boundary ) we will use the glsm to interpolate between the lg orbifold and the nonlinear sigma model(nlsm ) .",
    "the simplest way to obtain the lg orbifold from the glsm is to consider the limit @xmath57 . in this limit",
    ", the fields in the vector multiplet behave as lagrange multipliers .",
    "the @xmath58-field imposes the @xmath58-term constraints and the gauginos impose the constraint@xcite : @xmath59 for the case of the lg model with boundary , when one imposes _ dirichlet _ boundary conditions on all fields , this equation imposes a condition on the fermionic combination @xmath60 that is not set to zero by the boundary conditions .",
    "thus , the gaugino constraint on the boundary is now @xmath61    it is important to what follows that these fermions @xmath62 play the role of the boundary fermions that are used to construct coherent sheaves associated with b - type branes at large volume . the argument for this is based on two observations .",
    "first , the six - brane is one of the recknagel - schomerus states and hence arises from having dirichlet boundary conditions on all the fields in the case of the lg orbifold .",
    "this implies that in analytically continuing ( in khler moduli space ) the d - branes from the lg orbifold to the large volume limit , all dirichlet boundary conditions become neumann boundary conditions ( see also the discussion in @xcite ) .",
    "second , in the glsm construction that realises b - type branes as coherent sheaves , the boundary condition at large volume relates the @xmath62 to the boundary fermions @xmath63 via the boundary condition@xcite @xmath64 @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) are @xmath29 homogeneous polynomials of degree @xmath1 .",
    "this boundary condition appears for the coherent sheaf given by the following exact sequence @xmath67 which corresponds to imposing the _ holomorphic constraint _",
    "@xmath68 on @xmath29 fermions , @xmath63 ( @xmath66 ) . considered as sections of @xmath69 .",
    "treating the gaugino constraint in eq .",
    "( [ gaugino ] ) as a degree one holomorphic constraint , that is setting @xmath70 we obtain the euler sequence on @xmath56 @xmath71 with the boundary condition @xmath72 thus , one can indeed bypass the introduction of boundary fermions by treating the @xmath73 as boundary fermions and the gaugino constraint as a holomorphic constraint .",
    "of course , we have five boundary states associated with the lg orbifold .",
    "it turns out that the other four coherent sheaves are given by the following exact sequences that can be derived from the euler sequence ( given for @xmath74 below though we only need the case of @xmath75 here ) associated with @xmath76 @xmath77 note the appearance of the binomial coefficients @xmath78 in the above sequences .",
    "the boundary fermion construction naturally leads to the spinor bundle on @xmath79 rather than the coherent sheaf @xmath79 . in the glsm construction to obtain just the coherent sheaf we restrict to one - particle states in the corresponding boundary state .",
    "it was observed in @xcite ( see sec .",
    "5.3 ) that when @xmath79 is the cotangent bundle , the spinor bundle decomposes at different fermion numbers ( @xmath15 ) charge . ] to the different fractional branes .",
    "thus , the monodromy about the lg point is realised by suitably changing the restriction on the fermion number of the states .",
    "thus , the five fractional branes for the quintic are in one - to - one correspondence with the states : ( the vacuum @xmath80 satisfies @xmath81 ) @xmath82 subject to the condition @xmath83 being imposed .",
    "( a related observation was made by mayr in @xcite where he referred to the fractional branes as providing a fermionic basis for branes ) .",
    "we define ( using the notation in @xcite ) @xmath84 these branes @xmath85 can be identified as the result of the analytic continuation to large - volume of the rs states in the gepner model for the quintic . under the quantum @xmath86 symmetry(generated by @xmath87 ) , one has @xmath88",
    "a basic test of this identification is based on the idea that we expect the intersections of these branes ( which is a topological quantity computed by the open - string witten index ) to be the same at the orbifold point and at large volume . at the orbifold point",
    "the intersections can be readily computed from cft techniques .",
    "for coherent sheaves on a smooth cy we can compute the intersections using standard methods from differential geometry .",
    "the two must agree and they indeed do so for the @xmath89 states from among the rs states in the gepner model and the @xmath85 that we have just described above .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the case of fractional two - branes .",
    "as we have already seen , the neumann boundary condition on the combination @xmath90 is obtained from the supersymmetric variation of the boundary condition @xmath91 .",
    "thus , on the boundary , given these boundary conditions , we have effectively _ four _ independent fermionic multiplets .",
    "these fermionic multiplets are still subject to the condition ( [ gaugino ] ) imposed by the gaugino . after eliminating @xmath92 in favour of @xmath93 using eq .",
    "( [ quinticbc ] ) , eq .",
    "( [ gaugino ] ) can be re - written as the following condition @xmath94 thus , this is equivalent to having four boundary fermions subject to the one condition above . unlike the case of fractional zero - branes , we see that eq .",
    "( [ conda ] ) is trivially satisfied when @xmath95 .",
    "this is possible on @xmath56 , when @xmath96 .",
    "note that these conditions specify a two - brane ( denoted below by @xmath24 ) in the manifold which is the resolution of the @xmath97 singularity .",
    "it is trivial to see that this two - brane restricts to a point on the quintic .",
    "away from the two - brane @xmath24 , eq .",
    "( [ conda ] ) does reduce the number of fermions to three .",
    "this implies that the fermions are sections of the sheaf @xmath98 given by the following sequence @xmath99 the term involving @xmath100 has been added to take care of the fact that ( [ conda ] ) is trivially satisfied on @xmath24 .",
    "the following comments are in order here :    1 .",
    "@xmath100 , by definition , vanishes away from @xmath24 .",
    "in particular , it vanishes on the @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "2 .   defining @xmath103 the sequence can be rewritten as @xmath104 3 .",
    "@xmath105 restricts to @xmath106 on the @xmath107 not containing @xmath24 .",
    "the above sequence when restricted to the @xmath107 not containing @xmath24 becomes the euler sequence .",
    "note that @xmath98 is however a sheaf on @xmath56 even though the sequence which generates it is reminiscent of the euler sequence for @xmath107 .",
    "the above identification suggests that the remaining fractional branes can be given by exact sequences that on restriction to a @xmath107 not containing @xmath24 give the generalised euler sequences of @xmath107 .",
    "explicitly , we can write @xmath109 the last sequence which generates @xmath110 is rather interesting .",
    "one can argue that @xmath111 .",
    "that @xmath110 must at least have @xmath100 as a factor is clear since the last sequence must restrict to zero on on the @xmath101 not containing @xmath24 .",
    "this is because there is no corresponding generalized euler sequence that appears on @xmath107 .",
    "the factor of @xmath112 can be deduced from the general pattern that we observe in these sequences .",
    "we refer to @xmath110 as the _ coulomb branch brane _ because of this vanishing property on restriction to the @xmath107 not containing @xmath24 .",
    "the remaining branes @xmath113 will be called as the _ higgs branch branes_. as will be explained later , this parallels the _ missing branes _ that one needed to make a correspondence ( called the quantum mckay correspondence ) between d - branes on a non - supersymmetric orbifold and d - branes on the hirzebruch - jung resolution as considered by martinec and moore@xcite .",
    "this relationship will be made more precise in a later section .",
    "the main claim we wish to make is that the new fractional branes of @xcite are to be identified with ( a minus sign indicates an anti - brane ) @xmath114 provided we choose @xmath115 where @xmath116 generates the khler class on the quintic and is normalised such that @xmath117 . as a first check , we have verified that the chern classes of the @xmath118 agree with those given by ashok et .",
    "al . in @xcite .",
    "( more details are provided in appendix [ quinticintersection ] . )",
    "we also propose that under the quantum @xmath86 symmetry , one has @xmath119    we will motivate here this unusual assignment of chern character for the object @xmath100 while a more detailed justification of the appearance of the @xmath120 factor will be provided in a later section .",
    "it is clear from a simple argument that sheaves in the ambient projective space ( obtained from the fractional branes by blowing up the orbifold singularity ) when restricted to the calabi - yau would fail to give objects that have the charge of a single zero - brane on the cy .",
    "a two - brane wrapping a @xmath121 ( which intersects the quintic on a point ) will have chern character @xmath122 for some @xmath123 . on restricting this to the quintic , we obtain an object with chern character @xmath124 which has the charge of @xmath125 zero - branes . thus if we need to produce an object with the charge of a single zero - brane on the cy it appears that we must begin with a sheaf on @xmath56 whose chern character has leads off with a @xmath126 term .",
    "however more is clearly needed to justify this unusual choice .",
    "note that with this assignment of fractional chern characters to the object @xmath100 the maps in the exact sequences for the @xmath127 that we have given no longer have any obvious and rigorous mathematical meaning .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the large - volume analogs of the fractional zero - branes that we discussed earlier where this a clear correspondence between physical constructions in the glsm and rigourous mathematical constructions .",
    "nevertheless we will continue to use these exact sequences for the @xmath127 s at least as a convenient device or a mnemonic to write down their chern characters and hence their d - brane charges .",
    "the five new fractional two branes for the quintic are in one - to - one correspondence with the states : ( the vacuum @xmath80 satisfies @xmath81 and @xmath128 below ) @xmath129 subject to the modified gaugino constraint in eq .",
    "( [ conda ] ) being imposed on them .",
    "we now proceed to consider the case of fractional two - branes on @xmath4 as a somewhat simpler version of the quintic example that we just considered .",
    "while the orbifold aspects are carried in some generality , we will consider the large volume aspects in great detail for @xmath2 postponing the discussion to a future publication .",
    "in this section , we will discuss the case of fractional @xmath0-branes in @xmath2 .",
    "we will do so from two perspectives : ( i ) the boundary states at the orbifold point and ( ii ) sheaves on the resolved space using the glsm .",
    "we will first compute at the orbifold end two sets of intersection numbers , the intersection numbers between fractional two - branes and the fractional zero - branes and also the intersection numbers between the fractional two - branes themselves . even at the orbifold point , though the computations are well - known and we will use some of those results , we will emphasize some non - trivial features of the calculation that have not attracted due attention earlier .",
    "fractional @xmath0-branes on orbifolds have been considered , for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as we indicated earlier we expect that the intersection numbers that we obtain at the orbifold end will be reproduced by the sheaves that correspond to these objects when the khler modulus is continued to the large - volume region of the khler moduli space .",

    "its chern character as well as the those of the above @xmath321 can be worked out in the total space using the duality with the @xmath251 . an important point to emphasise here",
    "is that due to the non - compactness of these d - branes , it is better to work in the total space , which is the total space of the line bundle @xmath252 in our case .",
    "in fact , this happens to be true even for fractional zero - branes in cases with several divisors as has been considered in @xcite .",
    "it is of interest to construct the boundary states in the gepner model associated with linear boundary conditions that we considered in the lg orbifolds .",
    "this is what we shall pursue in this section .",
    "consider the holomorphic involution @xmath331 that permutes two fields : @xmath332 the fixed point(s ) of the action is @xmath333 ( this is a two - brane which we called @xmath24 which restricts to a point on the quintic @xmath334 ) as well as @xmath335(this is an eight - brane which restricts to a four - brane on the quintic ) .",

    "but , we have @xmath339 boundary states since both @xmath215 and @xmath337 each take @xmath125 values .",
    "how can this make sense ? in this regard it is useful to recall that there is a @xmath340 symmetry in the minimal models as well as their corresponding lg models which act as @xmath341 where @xmath342 is a non - trivial fifth - root of unity .",
    "focusing on the @xmath343 which act on the fields @xmath311 and @xmath312 , we see that the boundary condition @xmath344 is invariant only under the simultaneous action @xmath345 while @xmath346 or @xmath347 or the combination @xmath348 act as _ boundary condition changing operators_. thus , the 25 boundary states in the cft ( of @xcite ) correspond to the five sets of boundary conditions : @xmath349 thus , the @xmath337 index can be identified with @xmath350 .    * a second check : * ref .",
    "@xcite provides the intersection matrix between the permutation branes ( though the normalisation of the boundary states was not fixed in that paper ) . the result which we quote here ( after fixing the normalisation ) is the following :",
    "the intersection form is _ independent _ of @xmath337 and is given by @xmath351 .",
    "it is easy to see that the fractional two - branes that we propose at large volume also have the same intersection matrix ( see appendix [ quinticintersection ] ) .",
    "since the intersection form does depends on only the chern character ( equivalently , rr charges ) of the coherent sheaves , it will necessarily be independent of the @xmath337 label .",
    "for instance , the d0-branes obtained from the boundary conditions , ( [ quinticnewbc ] ) , are located at different points on the quintic .",
    "however , their charges are identical .    * a third check : * a last check is to compute the intersection matrix between the @xmath352 permutation boundary states and the rs boundary states and show that it equals @xmath353 as obtained in the appendix [ quinticintersection ] by computing the intersection matrix between the rs vector bundles and coherent sheaves for the fractional two - branes .",
    "this is a little bit more subtle since it involves characters that are not present in the bulk / closed string partition function .",
    "this issue has been discussed in a recent paper , so we do not present any details but refer the reader to it for a more detailed discussion@xcite . as is finally shown in there , the intersection matrix does take the form @xmath353 as predicted by the conjecture .",
    "it is natural to see if other permutation branes can be obtained by considering other linear boundary conditions involving more fields .",
    "one obvious candidate for the lg boundary conditions associated with the permutation brane @xmath354 : @xmath355 this will be a fractional four - brane and the open - string witten index computation in section 4 for fractional four - branes can be compared with the intersection matrices for the @xmath354 branes .",
    "the coulomb branes have support on the hypersurface @xmath356 corresponding to the conditions given in eq .",

    "this intersects the @xmath56 on a @xmath210 .",

    "these restrict to a two - brane ( of minimal charge ) on the quintic .",
    "the higgs branes will be related to euler sequences on @xmath3 .",
    "the other branes given in the aforementioned reference also seem to fit this .",
    "so this also passes a similar set of checks .",
    "thus , for the quintic , one is able to obtain objects which reproduce the full spectrum of charges  the fractional two - branes providing the zero - brane and the fractional four - brane providing the two - brane .",
    "another interesting boundary condition in the lg orbifold is the fractional four - brane given by @xmath365 this involves three fields and seems to be related to the permutation brane @xmath366 .",
    "however , this runs into trouble in the first check .",
    "it has been shown by the authors of @xcite that the cft states with @xmath367 correspond to ( in the lg ) to quadratic factors chosen in a particular order . however , in the lg there does nt seem to be any reason to prefer the ordering .",
    "these issues have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "we thank ilka brunner for drawing our attention to this interesting issue . ]",
    "correspond to .",
    "the permutation branes constructed in @xcite do not have enough labels to account for the @xmath368 boundary states that one anticipates by considering the action of the symmetries on this boundary condition . in this regard ,",
    "we wish to point out that for cyclic orbifolds@xcite , @xmath369 with @xmath370 , there is a fixed point resolution problem , related to the fact that the different primaries in the orbifold theory have the same character ( see section 5 of @xcite ) .",
    "this also suggests that the set of permutation branes given in @xcite may not be minimal and their resolution will provide us with additional boundary states that may account for the @xmath368 boundary states that we predict .",
    "we hope to discuss this issue in a future publication .",
    "we first summarise the main results of this paper .    *",
    "we have provided evidence that the new fractional branes obtained in @xcite using the method of matrix factorisation and boundary fermions are the same as those given by the boundary conditions proposed in @xcite .",
    "the methods used in this paper also lead to sequences for the new fractional branes which carry more information than chern classes / rr charges . as a consequence ,",
    "we show that fractional @xmath0-branes constructed in the non - compact calabi - yau restrict to the compact calabi - yau hypersurface as well defined objects .",
    "* we also provided evidence that a sub - class of the permutation branes proposed in @xcite are related to the new fractional branes .",
    "this result has also been independently obtained by brunner and gaberdiel recently@xcite . in particular , a detailed discussion of the permutation branes and the intersection matrices amongst them has been provided in their paper . * by embedding non - supersymmetric orbifolds into supersymmetric orbifolds in one higher dimension , we propose a quantum mckay correspondence that relates fractional @xmath0-branes on @xmath4 to ( the push - forward of ) tautological bundles on @xmath371 branes in supersymmetric orbifolds .",
    "we also provide an alternate explanation to the `` missing '' branes discussed in @xcite .",
    "this paper has dealt with , in many ways , the easiest of the examples .",
    "possible generalisations include the consideration of other examples involving weighted projective spaces ",
    "these typically involve many khler moduli and the sequences that we proposed in this paper for the new fractional branes will have a more complicated realisation .",
    "we plan to discuss this in @xcite .",
    "another class of boundary conditions that can appear in these examples are those that are not linear .",
    "for instance , consider the boundary condition @xmath372 that is consistent with the @xmath38 condition .",
    "how does one construct the boundary states corresponding to such a boundary condition ?",
    "an added complication is that they do not seem to be minimal submanifolds .",
    "what are their intersection forms ?",
    "in fact , it has been argued in @xcite that in more complicated examples , the addition of the analogue of the fractional two - branes and four - branes that we have considered do not give rise to all possible rr charge vectors .",
    "thus , one may be forced to deal with such boundary conditions .",
    "however the gepner model for such examples typically involve minimal models with even level @xmath373 . here ,",
    "even the rs boundary states are not minimal in the cardy sense .",
    "so the issue is somewhat clouded by the need to _ resolve _ the boundary states .",
    "coming back to the case of the quintic  while it is indeed satisfying to find objects in the gepner model / lg orbifold which provide all rr charges that appear on the quintic , it can not be the end of the story .",
    "the rs boundary states were related to spherical objects ( spherical in the sense that these objects have only @xmath374 ) on the quintic even though they did not span the lattice of rr charges .",
    "one would like to know , if there exists a basis of , say , four spherical objects on the quintic that give rise to all possible charges via bound state formation . in the framework of boundary fermions and matrix factorisation the superpotentials on these branes",
    "have been computed and their relationship to obstruction theory has been discussed .",
    "it would be interesting to see if those computations agree with an extension of the superpotential computation carried out for the rs branes in the lg model in@xcite to the case of the fractional two - branes and four - branes .    in this paper",
    ", we have shown a parallel between fractional @xmath0-branes on supersymmetric orbifolds and fractional zero - branes on non - supersymmetric orbifolds of dimensional lower by one .",
    "the coulomb branes in the non - supersymmetric orbifolds have been identified with the minima of the quantum superpotential of twisted chiral superfields .",
    "the coulomb branes , as we refer to them , among the fractional two - branes in our construction are associated with a chiral superfield .",
    "it appears possible to make the connection between the two situations precise by applying the hori - vafa map@xcite , which relates chiral superfields to twisted chiral superfields .",
    "this issue as well as an explanation for the change of basis proposed in @xcite will be discussed in @xcite .",
    "our reinterpretation of the quantum mckay correspondence will be useful for non - supersymmetric orbifolds in higher dimensions such as @xmath375 @xcite where there is no analogue of the hirzebruch - jung resolution via partial fractions .",
    "there is also the problem of terminal singularities that can appear .",
    "at least in cases where the higher dimensional supersymmetric orbifold admits a crepant resolution , one will be able to use the embedding to study aspects of the non - supersymmetric orbifold such as the possible end - points of tachyon condensation . +",

    "however , this is to be expected since a change in @xmath137 is obtained by twisting by @xmath398 , which is the monodromy at large volume . since these sheaves are obtained via analytic continuation , the ambiguity in @xmath137 is related to the possibility of choosing paths from the orbifold point to large volume which differ by a path around the large - volume point .",
