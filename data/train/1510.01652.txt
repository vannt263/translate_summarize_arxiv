    "fission is a very challenging kind of collective motion whose theoretical description can be addressed in terms of the evolution of a given nuclear system from its ground state to scission . to simplify this view such evolution",

    "the precise description of both the fission energy landscape and the associated shell effects remains as a major challenge in nuclear structure physics , with a potential impact on several basic research and technological areas .",
    "a detailed knowledge of the fission mechanism is required , for example , to better understand the very limits of the nuclear stability .",
    "as one goes up in atomic number z , the stability of the nucleus against fission tends to decrease , due to the increasing coulomb repulsion , and the quantum mechanical shell effects are the only mechanism to increase the chances of survival of a given element @xcite .",
    "fission properties of neutron - rich heavy nuclei are also relevant in the nucleosynthesis and abundances of elements with mass number greater than 120 due to competing fission recycling in the r - process in scenarios involving long neutron exposures @xcite .",
    "although induced fission is the process to understand , a preliminary description of the potential energy surfaces and spontaneous fission lifetimes of the involved nuclei can seed some light into the problem . also , systematic studies of the fission paths and related properties , based on complementary theoretical approaches , are very useful to deepen our knowledge of the different decay channels ( fission , @xmath1-decay , @xmath2 ) and their competition in heavy and super - heavy nuclei ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) . on the other hand , observables like the half - lives ,",
    "fragment mass and kinetic energy distributions are sensitive to the topography of the fission landscape . in turn",
    ", an improvement in the computation of those quantities would be very useful to determine the upper end of the nucleosynthesis flow @xcite .",
    "in addition to the physics already mentioned , nuclear fission remains a topic of high interest for reactor physics , the degradation of radioactive waste , prompt neutron - capture data from weapon tests as well as in the context of the progress made in recent years in the production of super - heavy elements ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .    with all this in mind ,",
    "we have carried out fission calculations for the radium isotopes from the stability line to very neutron rich isotopes in order to study the evolution of the potential energy surfaces and spontaneous fission lifetimes .",
    "this work can be considered as a complement to our previous fission studies in neutron - rich u and pu isotopes @xcite . as a side product of the calculations ,",
    "several examples of second fission isomers have been found .    from the theoretical point of view",
    "several models are used to describe nuclear fission . among them , both macroscopic - microscopic @xcite and mean - field ones are common choices .",
    "the approximation employed in this work belongs to the second class , i.e. , the hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) @xcite framework based on the highly predictive parametrizations d1s @xcite , d1n @xcite and d1 m @xcite of the gogny @xcite energy density functional ( edf ) . in this kind of studies , the potential energy surfaces ( pes ) of the different paths to fission , the associated collective masses and zero - point quantum corrections provided by the mean - field calculations , have been used to compute the spontaneous fission half - lives t@xmath3 as well as a first approach to the masses and charges of the fission fragments based on energetics .",

    "d1n and d1 m parametrizations of the gogny - edf have been performed .",

    "in addition , those edfs were fitted using information on neutron matter and therefore they are expected to perform well when extrapolating to neutron - rich systems like the ones considered in the present study . on the other hand , the thoroughly tested gogny - d1s @xcite edf , already successfully applied to fission studies in heavy and super - heavy nuclei @xcite , has been taken as a reference in this work .",
    "this will allow us to test the performance of the d1n and d1 m gogny - edfs scarcely used in fission calculations up to now .",

    "[ coclusions ] is devoted to the conclusions and work perspectives .",
    "in this section , we briefly outline the theoretical framework used in the present study . a detailed account of our methodology can be found in @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient is the hfb approximation @xcite , that is used with constrains on the axially symmetric quadrupole @xmath6 and octupole @xmath7 operators @xcite to obtain one - fragment ( 1f ) solutions .",
    "we are aware of the role played by triaxiality for configurations around the top of the inner barrier @xcite",
    ". however , we have kept axial symmetry , as a selfconsistent symmetry , along the whole fission path in order to reduce the already substantial computational effort .",
    "the @xmath8 degree of freedom has also been neglected in the computation of our t@xmath3 values [ see , eqs.([tsf ] ) and ( [ action ] ) below ] as it has been shown in previous studies @xcite that its impact is very limited .    for large values of the quadrupole moment q@xmath9 , two - fragment ( 2f ) solutions have been reached by constraining on the necking operator @xmath10 . in computing spontaneous fission lifetimes ( see below ) the ridge connecting the 1f and 2f curves in the multidimensional space of deformations ( @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 , @xmath2 ) has been neglected and therefore the 2f curves are considered as really intersecting the 1f ones @xcite .     as functions of the neutron number . , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    aside from the constraints already mentioned , as well as the typical hfb ones on both the proton and neutron numbers @xcite , a constraint on the operator @xmath14 is used to prevent spurious effects associated to the center of mass motion @xcite .",
    "note , that the average values of higher multipolarity deformations ( i.e. , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath2 ) are automatically adjusted during the selfconsistent minimization of the hfb energies .",
    "furthermore , as a result of projecting multidimensional paths into one - dimensional plots ( see , figs .",
    "[ fissionbarriersd1sd1nd1m240ra ] and [ fissionbarriers ] ) kinks and multiple branches may appear in this type of calculations @xcite .",
    "the hfb quasiparticle operators are expanded in a deformed axially symmetric harmonic oscillator ( ho ) basis with quantum numbers restricted by the condition @xmath17 where m@xmath18=17 and @xmath19 .",
    "this amounts to consider states with j@xmath20 quantum numbers up to 35/2 and up to 26 quanta in the @xmath21-direction . for a neutron - rich nucleus like @xmath22pu",
    "this basis provides an error ( with respect to a larger basis with m@xmath18=18 ) smaller than 0.8 mev all over the fission path @xcite .",
    "in addition , for each of the considered ( @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 , @xmath2)-configurations , the ho lengths b@xmath23 and b@xmath20 have been optimized so as to minimize the total hfb energy .",
    "this guarantees a much better convergence for relative energies ( see , fig.[fissionbarriers ] ) .    for the solution of the constrained mean - field equations we have employed an approximate second order gradient method based on the parametrization of a given hfb vacuum with the help of the thouless theorem @xcite .",
    "the two - body kinetic energy correction has been fully taken into account in the ritz - variational @xcite procedure while for the coulomb exchange term we have considered the slater approximation .",
    "the spin - orbit contribution to the pairing field has been neglected .",
    "we have computed the spontaneous fission half - life using the wentzel - kramer - brillouin ( wkb ) formalism @xcite    @xmath24    where the action @xmath25 along the ( minimal energy one - dimensional projected ) fission path reads @xmath26 in the above expression , @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the collective mass and potential for the collective variable @xmath11 .",
    "the potential energy is given by the hfb energy of the corresponding constrained state corrected by the quantum zero point vibrational @xmath29 and rotational @xmath30 energies .",
    "both the inertia @xmath27 and @xmath29 have been computed using the cranking approximation to the adiabatic time dependent hfb ( atdhfb ) approach @xcite and the gaussian overlap approximation ( goa ) to the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) @xcite while @xmath30 has been computed in terms of the yoccoz moment of inertia @xcite .",
    "the integration limits @xmath31 and @xmath32 in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) are the classical turning points @xcite corresponding to the energy @xmath33 . for the free parameter @xmath34 ,",
    "we have considered the four values @xmath34=0.5 , 1.0 , 1.5 and 2.0 mev in order to study its impact on lifetimes .",
    "it should be kept in mind that different e@xmath35 values lead to different integration limits and , therefore , modify the value of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ action ] ) .",
    "this is particularly relevant , in the case of neutron - rich ra isotopes which display high and wide fission barriers .",
    "finally , in order to study the competition between the spontaneous fission and @xmath1-decay modes , we have computed the corresponding @xmath36 values using the viola - seaborg formula @xmath37 with the parameters @xmath38=1.64062 , @xmath39=-8.54399 , @xmath40=-0.19430 and @xmath41=-33.9054 as given in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath42 value is obtained from the calculated binding energies for ra and rn nuclei .",
    "obviously , other types of decay ( for example , @xmath43-decay ) may play a role in the case of heavy neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "however , their study lies outside the scope of this work .",
    "an illustrative outcome of our calculations is presented in fig.[fissionbarriersd1sd1nd1m240ra ] for the nucleus @xmath4ra .",

    ", scaledwidth=50.0% ]    as can be seen , the gogny - d1s edf provides a pronounced under - binding as compared to the d1n and d1 m ones .",
    "this reflects a well known deficiency of the former in heavier nuclei @xcite as a result of which both the d1n and d1 m parametrizations have been specially tailored in an effort to build an accurate mass table based on the gogny - edf @xcite . a similar behavior has been found in our symmetry - projected configuration mixing study of the quadrupole collectivity across the n=126 neutron shell closure @xcite as well as in @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is satisfying to observe that the 1f curves provided by all the functionals are rather similar with the ground state at q@xmath9= 14 b.    the first fission isomer appears at q@xmath9= 48 , 44 and 40 b with the d1s , d1n and d1 m parametrizations .",
    "their excitation energies are 1.74 , 3.23 and 3.86 mev , respectively .",
    "they are separated from the ground state by inner barriers with heights ( without triaxiality ) of 8.41 , 8.44 and 8.48 mev , respectively .",

    "the atdhfb collective masses are displayed in panel ( d ) .",
    "their behavior is well correlated with the one for the pairing energies shown in panel ( b ) and the inverse dependence of the collective mass with the square of the pairing gap @xcite .",
    "the gcm collective masses ( not shown in the figure ) display a similar pattern though they are smaller than the atdhfb ones . for @xmath4ra and e@xmath35=1.0 mev , for example ,",
    "this leads to pronounced differences of 10 , 12 and 13 orders of magnitude in the t@xmath3 values predicted in the two schemes with the d1s , d1n and d1 m parameter sets , respectively .",
    "these large uncertainties , are one of the main reasons driving our choice of both schemes in the computation of the spontaneous fission half - lives . in all the computations of the t@xmath3 values ,",
    "the wiggles in the collective masses have been softened by means of a three point filter @xcite .",
    "let us also mention that , for large quadrupole moments , the 2f solutions in @xmath4ra correspond to a spherical @xmath56cd and an oblate ( @xmath57=-0.21 ) and slightly octupole deformed ( @xmath58=0.03 ) @xmath59zr fragment . with the d1s , d1n and d1 m gogny - edfs , the oblate @xmath59zr fragment minimizes coulomb repulsion energies of 166.31 , 166.34 and 166.55 mev , respectively .",
    "oblate fragments have also been found by fissioning other ra ( see , below ) , u and pu @xcite nuclei . here",
    ", we would like to stress that fragment masses are the result of the miniminization of the hfb energy at a given distance between the fragments and therefore should only be taken as rough approximations to the peaks of the broad fragments mass distribution @xcite .",
    "the heavier fragment , @xmath56cd , is a consequence of its neutron number n=82 being a magic number @xcite .",

    "for each isotope the relative energies are always referred to the absolute minima of the 1f curves in order to accommodate all the paths , obtained with the d1s , d1n and d1 m gogny - edfs , in a single plot .",
    "results for @xmath4ra are also included in the figure for the sake of completeness .",
    "the ground state deformation decreases with increasing neutron number n reaching its minimal value q@xmath9= 2b for @xmath64ra . using the corresponding ground state energies , we have computed the two - neutron separation energies s@xmath65 shown in fig .",
    "[ s2n - d1s - d1n - d1 m ] .",

    "the smaller s@xmath65 values obtained with the d1s as compared with the d1n and d1 m parametrizations ( typically around 1 mev ) are due to the well known under - binding of the d1s parametrization .",
    "the excitation energies e@xmath67 of the first fission isomers and the inner barrier heights b@xmath67 ( without triaxiality ) are summarized in fig .  [ barriers - d1s - d1n - d1m - i ] . with all the functionals , the e@xmath67 values increase almost linearly as functions of the neutron number exception made of @xmath68ra ( 4.02 , 3.70 and 4.71 mev with the d1s , d1n and d1 m gogny - edfs ) for which a change in tendency is observed .",
    "the barrier heights b@xmath67 reach their minimal values ( 4.51 , 3.85 and 4.86 mev with the d1s , d1n and d1 m gogny - edfs ) for the n=164 nucleus @xmath68ra and increase for heavier isotopes .",
    "such an increase agrees well with the hfb predictions for neutron - rich u and pu nuclei @xcite and previous extended thomas - fermi ( etf ) results @xcite .",
    "an increase is also visible in the recently reported macroscopic - microscopic b@xmath67 values for even - even ra isotopes with 166 @xmath0 n @xmath0 182 @xcite .",
    "larger b@xmath67 values , together with the widening of the 1f curves , leads to larger spontaneous fission half - lives as one moves towards more neutron - rich systems ( see , fig .",
    "[ tsf - d1s - d1n - d1 m ] ) .",
    "we are aware of the reduction , by a few mev , of the inner barrier heights b@xmath67 once triaxiality is taken into account ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , such a reduction has already been found in our previous gogny - d1 m hfb calculations for a set of u , pu , cm and cf nuclei ( see table i and fig .  4 of @xcite ) .",
    "though we have mainly kept axial symmetry along the fission paths of the considered ra isotopes , we have also corroborated in some selected cases ( i.e. , @xmath60ra , @xmath69ra and @xmath70ra ) the reduction of the corresponding b@xmath67 values once the @xmath8 degree of freedom is included .",
    "however , such a reduction comes together with an increase of the collective inertia @xcite that tends to compensate in the final value of the action . as a result ,",
    "the impact of the @xmath8 degree of freedom is very limited and has not been considered in our calculations of the spontaneous fission half - lives .",
    "coming back to fig .",
    "[ fissionbarriers ] , one also observes another common feature provided by all the the gogny - edfs , i.e. , second fission isomers in the 1f curves of the studied ra nuclei . for the isotopes @xmath71ra their quadrupole deformations are within the range 68 b @xmath0 q@xmath9 @xmath0",

    "[ barriers - d1s - d1n - d1m - ii ] .",
    "though all the considered functionals provide a similar trend , the largest barrier heights b@xmath72 are obtained with the d1 m parametrization .",

    "note , that for neutron numbers n @xmath73 164 , the predicted d1s and d1n b@xmath72 values are rather close ( see , fig .  [ fissionbarriers ] ) .",
    "the largest e@xmath72 energies are also the ones obtained with the gogny - d1 m edf . here",

    "[ fissionbarriers ] ) .",
    "the previous results for e@xmath67 , e@xmath72 , b@xmath67 and b@xmath72 agree well with the ones obtained for u and pu nuclei @xcite .",

    "they are also visible in the 1f curves of the isotopes @xmath74th for which preliminary calculations have been carried out .",
    "the same conclusions can be extracted from recent bcpm @xcite , skyrme @xcite and relativistic mean - field @xcite studies .",
    "therefore , the shell effects leading to second fission isomers ( i.e. , third minima ) in this region of the nuclear chart are systematically present in all the mean - field approximations already mentioned .",
    "however , further studies are required in order to clarify the relation between the mean - field predictions and the available experimental data .            in order to further understand the origin of the extra stability leading to second fission isomers ,",
    "we have performed a similar analysis to the one of @xcite where the spatial density for that second isomer is compared to the densities of two nuclei summing up the same number of protons and neutrons as the parent nucleus . in order to choose the @xmath75 and @xmath76 values used , we plot the number of particles @xmath77 up to a distance @xmath21 .",

    "the densities computed with the d1s , d1n and d1 m gogny - edfs are quite similar and therefore , we will focus on the results obtained with the d1s parameter set .",
    "the densities of the three nuclei show some differences as a consequence of the different number of protons and neutrons as well as the different quadrupole moment but qualitatively they look rather similar pointing to a weak dependence with neutron number . with respect to the `` fragments '' ,",
    "the heavier one is always a rare earth nucleus with a prolate deformation in its ground state .",
    "the light `` fragment '' is characterized by its proton number close or equal to the magic @xmath78 one , that leads to a spherical ground state . in spite of",
    "being spherical , the three light `` fragments '' have a quadrupole potential energy surface showing a shoulder at @xmath79 with an excitation energy of just a couple mev .",
    "the density of that `` excited configuration '' matches quite well the density of the second isomer and therefore the existence of the third minimum could be linked to shell effects in the light system associated to the above mentioned shoulder .",
    "this finding has to be confirmed by a similar analysis in other th , u and pu nuclei showing a second fission isomer .",
    "let us turn our attention , to the proton ( @xmath80 ) , neutron ( @xmath81 ) and mass ( @xmath82 ) numbers of the fragments obtained at the hfb level in @xmath5ra which are plotted in fig .",
    "[ mass - d1s - d1n - d1 m ] .",
    "as can be seen the overall trend is quite reminiscent of the one in u and pu nuclei @xcite .",

    "the atdhfb half - lives are always larger than the gcm ones for a given e@xmath35 .",
    "for example , for @xmath66ra ( @xmath68ra ) the gcm values are 5.492 @xmath91 10@xmath92 ( 2.243 @xmath91 10@xmath93 ) , 2.951 @xmath91 10@xmath94 ( 4.578 @xmath91 10@xmath95 ) and 5.247 @xmath91 10@xmath96 ( 2.755 @xmath91 10@xmath97 ) s while atdhfb ones are 5.884 @xmath91 10@xmath98 ( 2.293 @xmath91 10@xmath99 ) , 2.513 @xmath91 10@xmath100 ( 1.992 @xmath91 10@xmath101 ) and 8.511 @xmath91 10@xmath102 ( 3.094 @xmath91 10@xmath103 ) s with the d1s , d1n and d1 m gogny - edfs and e@xmath35=1.0 mev .",
    "in fact , for the isotopes with n @xmath0 166 , we have found differences of up to 11 , 14 and 15 orders of magnitude between the two schemes . we observe a steady increase of the t@xmath3 values in heavier isotopes , with the differences between the gcm and atdhfb predictions reaching 20 , 24 and 22 orders of magnitude in the case of @xmath64ra with the d1s , d1n and d1 m parameter sets ( e@xmath35=1.0 mev ) .",
    "the conclusion is that t@xmath3 values strongly depend upon the details of the calculation and the functional used with `` error bars '' of up to 20 orders of magnitude .",
    "however , a global trend is observed in _ all _ the cases , i.e. , the slight increase of t@xmath3 as a function of neutron number up to n=166 which is followed by a steeper increase that continues up to the largest neutron number considered , ruling out the possibility of fission recycling in the r - process . in order to examine the competition between the spontaneous fission and @xmath1-decay modes , in fig .",
    "[ tsf - d1s - d1n - d1 m ] we have also included the @xmath1-decay half - lives eq.([vseaborg - new ] ) .",
    "though the precise transition point depends of the selected gogny - edf , we conclude that with increasing neutron number fission turns out to be faster than @xmath1-decay .",
    "as expected , pairing correlations have a strong impact on the spontaneous fission half - lives obtained for the considered ra nuclei .",
    "we have tested that , similar to previous gogny and/or bcpm results @xcite , an increase of the pairing field by only 5 or 10 @xmath104 leads to a significant decrease in the predicted t@xmath3 values . however , even in such a case , the previous conclusion ( i.e. , fission dominates over @xmath1-decay for increasing n ) remains valid regardless of the gogny - edf used in the calculations .",
    "in the present work , we have studied the fission properties of even - even ra isotopes with neutron numbers 144 @xmath0 n @xmath0 176 within a mean field framework @xcite . with the aim to test the robustness of our hfb predictions with respect to the particular version of the gogny - edf @xcite employed , calculations have been carried out with the parameter sets d1s @xcite , d1n @xcite and",
    "d1 m @xcite . the fission paths ( i.e. , the 1f and 2f solutions ) have been determined , for each ra isotope , with the help of constraints on the proton @xmath105 and neutron @xmath106 number operators as well as on the axially symmetric quadruple @xmath6 , octupole @xmath7 , @xmath14 and necking @xmath10 operators . for each of the considered ( @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13 , @xmath2)-configurations we have also performed an optimization of the lengths of the ( deformed ) axially symmetric ho single - particle basis in order to improve the convergence of the relative energies @xcite .",
    "the mean field equations have been solved using an approximate second order gradient method that allows to handle several constraints efficiently @xcite .",
    "zero point vibrational and rotational corrections have always been added to both the 1f and 2f hfb energies .",
    "regardless of the considered gogny - edf , the 1f curves of the studied ra nuclei exhibit a similar rich topography consisting of , for example , the ground state minimum , first and second fission isomers as well as first and second barriers .",
    "a change in tendency is observed for the excitation energies of the first @xmath107 and second @xmath108 isomers as well as for the heights of the first @xmath47 an second @xmath49 barriers at the neutron number n=164 . for some selected ra isotopes ,",
    "we have also corroborated the expected reduction of the inner barrier heights @xmath47 @xcite once the @xmath8 degree of freedom is taken into account .",
    "moreover , in order to better understand the structure of the third minima along the 1f curves , we have studied their density profiles .",
    "ours agree well with previous results @xcite and suggest that those third minima in ra nuclei could be linked to shell effects associated with an excited ( deformed ) configuration in a light ( spherical ) system with z @xmath48 28 .",
    "a more detailed study , including other th , u and pu nuclei showing a second fission isomer , will be presented elsewhere .",
    "we have obtained the masses and charges of the fission fragments , from ( variational ) 2f solutions at the largest quadrupole moments .",
    "a symmetric splitting into two @xmath85ru nuclei is predicted for @xmath68ra as well as oblate and slightly octupole deformed fission fragments for several other ra isotopes .",
    "though the predicted overall trend for the fragments masses and charges agrees reasonably well with available data @xcite for this region of the nuclear chart , we stress that our procedure tends to overestimate @xcite the role of the proton z=50 and neutron n=82 magic numbers @xcite .",
    "therefore , a more sophisticated @xcite approach , taking into account the quantum dynamics around the scission configurations @xcite , is still required .",
    "the spontaneous fission half - lives t@xmath109 have been computed within the standard wkb approximation @xcite .",
    "both the atdhfb @xcite and the gcm @xcite schemes have been employed to obtain the collective masses and the zero point vibrational corrections while for the rotational energies we have resorted to an approximate variation - after - projection ( vap ) @xcite in terms of the yoccoz moment of inertia @xcite . in spite of the large uncertainties in the predicted t@xmath3 values , mainly related to the details of the calculations ( including the strength of pairing correlations and the gogny - edf used ) a robust global trend",
    "is observed , i.e. , the slight increase of the t@xmath3 values up to n=166 followed by a steady increase up to @xmath64ra that correlates well with the one of the barrier heights and the widening of the 1f curves in heavier ra isotopes . as a result ,",
    "heavier neutron - rich ra nuclei become stable against spontaneous fission , diminishing the importance of fission recycling in the r - process @xcite . furthermore ,",
    "our calculations indicate that with increasing neutron number fission turns out to be faster than @xmath1-decay .    from the results discussed in this paper we conclude that the fission properties found for neutron - rich u and pu @xcite are preserved down to neutron - rich ra nuclei .",
    "this motivates further explorations in this region of the nuclear chart using the gogny - hfb framework . within this context",
    ", a long list of tasks should be undertaken . among them , the following two appear as our next plausible steps .",
    "first , a minimal action , instead of minimal energy , description of fission including pairing fluctuations @xcite in addition to multipole moments @xcite should receive more attention . however , a more realistic treatment of the vibrational mass parameters is still required within the framework presented in @xcite . here , we also refer the reader to the recent study @xcite where coherent and time - feasible calculations of the vibrational masses have been envisioned using the gogny - hfb plus the quasiparticle random - phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "second , the study of the fission properties in odd - a nuclei will provide valuable information on the predictive power of our gogny - hfb approach to account for the larger t@xmath3 values in those nuclear systems compared with the corresponding even - a neighbors ( i.e. , the hindrance factors ) @xcite . here",
    ", the gogny - hfb equal filling approximation ( efa ) @xcite , represents a reasonable and computationally feasible starting point .",
