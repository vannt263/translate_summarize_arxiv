    "entanglement , the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics  @xcite , is central in einstein , podolsky , and rosen s ( epr s ) argument of incompleteness of quantum mechanics  @xcite and in bell s proof that quantum mechanics is incompatible with epr s local realistic view of the world  @xcite .",
    "this debate stimulated the search for sources of entangled states and the first experiments on the violation of bell s inequalities  @xcite .",
    "nowadays , however , the role of quantum entanglement is more ubiquitous .",
    "entanglement is considered a physical resource and a key ingredient for quantum information processing and quantum computation  @xcite .",
    "the challenge now for the development of quantum information technologies is having reliable and efficient sources to produce , distribute , and detect entangled states .",
    "although sources of entanglement have been described and demonstrated in many branches of physics , so far the most common way to _",
    "distribute _ entanglement is by means of pairs of photons .",
    "the most reliable source of entanglement between photons is the spontaneous parametric down conversion ( spdc ) process  @xcite .",
    "the importance of having an accurate description of the distributed entangled states created in spdc processes is therefore clear .",
    "the violation of bell s inequalities provides a basic tool with which to detect entanglement  @xcite . in realistic applications , where pure entangled states become mixed states due to different types of noise ,",
    "violations of bell s inequalities provide a method to characterize the robustness of the entanglement against noise . for this purpose ,",
    "different methods for creating two - photon polarization mixed states have been proposed , analyzed , and tested  @xcite .",
    "it has been recently pointed out  @xcite that a colorless noise model is not the best choice for describing states produced in type  ii spdc , but that a more realistic description is given by an alternative one parameter model where a maximally entangled state is mixed with decoherence terms in a preferred polarization basis .",
    "it turns out to be that this distinction between colorless and colored noise is crucial when we look for maximal violations of bell s inequalities for bipartite entangled states .    in real applications ,",
    "an example of colored noise could be due to the first order polarization mode dispersion ( pmd ) phenomena because of birefringence in optical fibers .",
    "there are different manifestations of pmd depending on the view taken ; in the frequency domain , one sees , for a fixed input polarization , a change with frequency @xmath0 of the output polarization ; in the time domain , one observes a mean time delay of a pulse traversing the fiber which is a function of the polarization of the input pulse .",
    "poole and wagner  @xcite discovered that there exists special orthogonal pairs of polarization at the input and the output of the fiber called the psps .",
    "light launched in a psp does not change polarization at the output to first order in @xmath0 .",
    "these psps have group delays @xmath1 , which are the maximum and minimum mean time delays of the time domain view .    some insight into the pmd problem can be made simply by contemplating a piece of polarization - maintaining fiber .",
    "its psps are the polarizations along the principal axes of birefringence of the fiber .",
    "let us suppose that a polarization entangled state is launched in this kind of fiber : after the propagation the state will be affected by colored noise due to the different group velocity experimented by photons in the birefringent medium .",
    "violations of bell s inequalities for two - photon polarization - entangled states with colored noise are extremely robust against noise , whereas this is not the case for states with white noise  @xcite . from the experimental point of view",
    ", there exists some evidence supporting this predicted behavior in experiments with two - qutrit states and low noise  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to experimentally test the predictions of  @xcite for the case of two - qubit states for the full range of values of the parameter characterizing the amount of noise .",
    "spdc may be viewed as a three - photon coherent process : a noncentrosymmetric crystal is illuminated by a pump laser intense enough to stimulate nonlinear effects .",
    "the second order interaction results in the annihilation of a pump photon and the creation of two down converted photons , entangled in space - time or , equivalently , in wave number - frequency  @xcite .",
    "specifically , in type  ii spdc the incident pump is split in a pair of orthogonally polarized photons .",
    "phase - matching by itself does not guarantee entanglement because , if we restrict our attention to the photons found in the intersections of the cones made by the extraordinary ( @xmath2 ) and ordinary ( @xmath3 ) rays exiting the crystal , the two down - conversion alternatives @xmath4 and @xmath5 are not indistinguishable .",
    "the indistinguishability is achieved by the use of different kinds of compensation schemes .",
    "these schemes , however , are typically not perfect . for this reason , while correlations are very strong in the natural basis of the crystal , the same is not true for the maximally conjugated basis . a realistic description of the states produced in type  ii spdc is given by a one parameter model , where a pure state is mixed with decoherence terms in a preferred polarization basis .",
    "these states with colored noise can be expressed as @xmath6 where @xmath7 the parameter @xmath8 is the probability of creating the bell state @xmath9 .",
    "if we are interested in maximal violations of the most general two - party two - output bell inequality , the clauser - horne - shimony - holt ( chsh ) inequality  @xcite given by @xmath10 where the bell operator is @xmath11 then , it is sufficient to consider the following local observables : @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the usual pauli matrices .    for @xmath15 states  ( [ coloredstates ] ) and the local observables ( [ a0])([b1 ] ) , the bell operator is @xmath16 \\notag \\\\ & & + \\sin\\left(2\\phi\\right)\\left(1+p\\right)\\sin\\left(2\\theta \\right)\\left [ 1-\\cos\\left(2\\theta\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the maximum value of @xmath17 depends on @xmath8 in a complex way ( for a similar calculation , see  @xcite ) .",
    "the interesting points are that @xmath15 states violate the chsh inequality for _ any _ @xmath8 , and that the maximum violations occur for local observables which depend on @xmath18  @xcite .",
    "to test this predicted behavior of the colored mixed states in the laboratory we use the timing compensation scheme introduced by kim _",
    "et al . _",

    "[ fig1 ] . in arm  1 of the interferometer , a half wave plate ( hwp ) rotates the polarization @xmath19 , so that the natural emission @xmath20 , @xmath21 becomes @xmath22 , @xmath23 .",
    "the state after the first polarization beamsplitter ( pbs ) is @xmath24 where @xmath25 describes the spectral distribution of the pump field and @xmath26 is the central wavelength , and @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are , respectively , the group velocities of the pump , the @xmath3-photon , and the @xmath2-photon inside the @xmath31-long crystal . the density matrix ( obtained by tracing over the nonpolarization degrees of freedom )",
    ", can be expressed as @xmath32 where @xmath33 being @xmath34 and @xmath35 is the bandwidth of the pump laser .",
    "therefore , by changing the parameter @xmath36 , which is related to the optical delay introduced by the `` trombone '' in arm  2 of the interferometer , it is possible to control the degree of colored noise of the state .",
    "for @xmath37 we ideally obtain the pure state @xmath38 .    in the experimental setup ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) , a 3 mm long beta - barium borate crystal , cut for a type  ii phase - matching , is pumped by a train of uv ( @xmath39 nm ) ultrafast ( 120fs ) pulses generated by the second harmonic of a ti : sapphire laser .",
    "spdc photon pairs at 820 nm @xmath40 are generated with an emission angle of @xmath41 .",
    "after passing through the interferometer , the photons are coupled by lenses into single - mode fibers .",
    "coupling efficiency has been optimized by a proper engineering of the pump and the collecting mode in experimental conditions .",
    "dichroic mirrors are placed in front of the fiber couplers to reduce stray light due to pump scattering .",
    "hwps before the fiber coupler , together with fiber - integrated polarizing beamsplitters ( pbss ) , project photons in the polarization basis @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "photons are detected by single photon counters ( perkin - elmer spcm - aqr-14 ) .",
    "the local observables @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 can be rewritten for the chosen polarization basis @xmath48 as @xmath49 and the correlation function @xmath50 can be expressed in terms of coincidence detection probabilities @xmath51 as @xmath52 where @xmath53 are the two outputs of the integrated pbs and @xmath54 are expressed in terms of coincident counts , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the number of coincidences measured by the pair of detectors @xmath57 in the polarization basis described above .",

    "there is a very good qualitative and quantitative agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions  @xcite",
    ". specifically , we observe violations of the chsh inequality even for low values of @xmath8 . note , however , that the experimental maximum violations of the chsh stands slightly below the theoretical predictions .",
