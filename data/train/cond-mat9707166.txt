    "incommensurate magnetic structures in insulators are as a rule caused by a competition between two or more magnetic interactions . in the classic description of a spiral spin structure in mno@xmath0 yoshimori attributed the spiral spin arrangement to a competition between two distinct antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg exchange interactions in the crystal.@xcite we shall refer to this kind of spiral state as `` exchange spiral '' .",
    "an alternative mechanism is realized in a few systems with non - centric crystal structures .",
    "isotropic exchange terms in the hamiltonian compete with dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( d - m ) interactions.@xcite the former are proportional to @xmath5 , i.e. , the scalar product of interacting spins , and thus favor a collinear state .",
    "the d - m term is given by a _",
    "vector _ product and is usually written as @xmath6)$ ] , where @xmath7 is the so - called dzyaloshinskii vector that characterizes the oriented bond between spins @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "d - m interactions favor a relative angle of @xmath10 between spins . unlike isotropic exchange , d - m coupling is of relativistic origin , i.e. , is a result of spin - orbit interactions , and ties the spin system to the underlying crystal lattice via orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "the best known examples of real compounds where this second scenario ( `` relativistic spiral '' ) is realized are the mnsi@xcite and fege.@xcite recently we have observed an incommensurate spiral spin structure in ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 and explained it within this framework.@xcite    while the ground states in both models ( `` exchange '' and `` relativistic '' ) may be similar , under certain conditions they behave very differently in applied magnetic fields .",
    "if only isotropic exchange interactions are present , the direction of magnetic field is irrelevant to the spin structure : the spin space may be freely rotated without a change in interaction energy and the spins are not tied to any particular direction in the crystal . for `` relativistic ''",
    "spiral magnets the spin structure in an external field @xmath4 in general may be strongly dependent on the relative orientation of @xmath4 and the dzyaloshinskii vectors , although in several special cases of high - symmetry crystal structures this is not so . in fege for example ,",
    "the interactions of each spin with its neighbors are characterized by dzyaloshinskii vectors pointing in all three equivalent orthogonal directions . in this situation applying a very small magnetic field always leads to a re - orientation of the spin rotation plane normal to the field direction , and , consequently , the propagation vector becomes aligned along the field .",
    "the length of the magnetic propagation vector is to a good approximation field - independent .    in materials of lower crystal symmetry",
    ", as for example in hexagonal cscucl@xmath12@xcite and rbmnbr@xmath12 @xcite , or tetragonal ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 , the spin rotation plane can not be freely re - oriented without affecting the dzyaloshinskii energy . as a result , the magnetic structure undergoes drastic changes for certain field geometries , and the length of the propagation vector becomes strongly field - dependent .",
    "an extreme example of this behaviour is the commensurate - incommensurate transition that we have recently observed and theoretically analyzed for ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1.@xcite as a magnetic field is applied along the unique @xmath13 axis of the tetragonal structure , the initially uniform sinusoidal spin - spiral is distorted . in a non - zero field",
    "it may be viewed as a soliton lattice , a regular arrangement of anti - phase domain wall boundaries separating regions of commensurate antiferromagnetic spin - flop phase . as the field",
    "is increased , the period of the structure , given by the distance between solitons , increases and diverges at some critical field ,",
    "@xmath14  t , above which a commensurate spin - flop state is observed .    in this work",
    "we address the field dependence of the magnetic structure of ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 in a magnetic field @xmath4 applied in the @xmath2 tetragonal plane .",
    "we show that the square - lattice spin arrangement in this geometry allows an almost unhindered re - orientation of the spin plane with only a very small change in the period of the structure , much like in cubic fege .",
    "the principal difference between fege and ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 is that in the former material the propagation vector rotates towards the direction of applied field .",
    "we find that for ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 the propagation vector tends to form a finite angle with @xmath4 , that depends on the orientation of @xmath4 itself .",
    "the rotation of the propagation vector with increasing field is continuous .",
    "the observed behaviour is found to be in very good agreement with theoretical predictions based on a 2-dimensional generalization of the simple ginzburg - landau energy functional that we have previously employed to describe the dzyaloshinskii transition in ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "a single crystal of ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 , the same sample that was used in our previous work , was studied in a neutron diffraction experiment at the high flux isotope reactor at oak ridge national laboratory , on the hb-3 triple - axis spectrometer .",
    "the sample , roughly @xmath15  mm@xmath16 in volume , was mounted in a small aluminum container where it was secured with compressed al - foil .",
    "the container was in turn mounted on a precision micro - goniometer , that was used to align the @xmath2 crystallographic plane in the scattering plane of the spectrometer , prior to setting up the sample in the cryomagnet .",
    "the magnetic field was produced by using a split - coil _ horizontal - field _ superconducting solenoid .",
    "the construction of the magnet provides two pairs of windows for the incident and outgoing neutron beams .",
    "the larger pair of windows , each window being @xmath17 wide , is oriented perpendicular to the field direction .",
    "an additional narrower pair of windows ( @xmath18 ) is positioned around the direction of magnetic field . within the cryomagnet",
    "the sample could be manually rotated around the vertical axis _ in situ_.",
    "we estimate the uncertainty in the initial alignment of the sample relative to the field direction to be of the order of @xmath19 . after this initial setting the relative rotation of the sample in the magnet",
    "was done with much higher accuracy , @xmath20 , as it could be directly followed by monitoring the in - plane bragg reflections .",
    "measurements were done for several values of the angle @xmath21 between the magnetic field and the @xmath22 $ ] direction , namely , for @xmath2345.0 , 50.0 , 52.9 , 57.5 , 60.2 , 61.7 , 61.9 , 71.5 and 75.2@xmath24 , the field always being applied in the @xmath2 plane of the crystal .",
    "although the magnet is capable of much higher field strengths , stray fields are a serious problem , and all the measurements were done in @xmath25  t. the temperature of the sample was controlled by a standard he - flow cryostat , allowing us to perform measurements in the temperature range @xmath26@xmath27  k. as we will discuss in detail below , the magnetic structure changes in applied fields , but this effect shows a very strong field - hysteresis . to avoid this complication all the measurements",
    "were done using field - cooling .",
    "the sample was first warmed up to @xmath28  k , well above the temperature of magnetic ordering @xmath29  k,@xcite the desired strength and direction of the magnetic field were set , and only then was the sample brought down to base temperature , @xmath30  k , where most of the measurements were performed .    at all times",
    "the measurements were done in 3-axis mode to reduce the signal to background ratio .",
    "@xmath31 collimations were used with pyrolitic graphite ( pg ) ( 002 ) reflections for monochromator and analyzer , with @xmath32  mev neutron energy and a pg filter positioned in front of the sample .",
    "the crystal and magnetic structures of ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 are discussed in detail in our previous publications on the subject,@xcite and only the most essential features are reviewed here .",
    "the magnetcic cu@xmath33 ions form a square lattice in the @xmath2 tetragonal plane of the crystal .",
    "the principal axes of this square lattice , hereafter referred to as the @xmath34 and @xmath35 axis , are along the @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath36 $ ] directions , respectively . to complete the coordinate system we shall choose the @xmath37 axis to run along @xmath38 $ ] . in the ordered phase ( below @xmath29  k ) the spins lie in the @xmath39 plane and the magnetic propagation vector",
    "is @xmath40 , where @xmath41 .",
    "the magnetic structure is a distortion of a nel spin arrangement : a translation along @xmath42 induces a spin rotation by an angle @xmath43 ( relative to an exact antiparallel alignment ) in the @xmath39 plane . along the @xmath44 $ ] direction",
    "nearest - neighbor spins are perfectly antiparallel .",
    "nearest - neighbor spins from adjacent cu - planes are aligned parallel to each other .",
    "obviously , domains with propagation vectors @xmath45 are equivalent and always equally represented in a zero - field - cooled sample .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ cont](a ) which shows a contour plot of elastic intensities measured at @xmath30  k on a mesh of points around the @xmath46 position in zero field .",
    "we clearly see 4 magnetic reflections symmetrically grouped around the af zone center .",
    "the two pairs of peaks , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , correspond to the two magnetic domains .",
    "the propagation vector @xmath49 , measured relative to the af zone center , is strictly along the @xmath22 $ ] ( or @xmath44 $ ] ) direction .",
    "the weak feature around @xmath46 is an artifact that is temperature - independent and was previously identified as a multiple scattering peak.@xcite cooling the sample in a very weak magnetic field ( @xmath50  mt ) always produces a single - domain structure .",
    "when a magnetic field is applied along the @xmath51 $ ] direction the diffraction pattern begins to change .",
    "the propagation vector @xmath49 starts to rotate in reciprocal space towards the direction of applied field [ fig .",
    "[ cont](b ) ] , eventually becoming perfectly aligned with it [ fig .",
    "[ cont](c ) ] .",
    "note that all this happens in rather small fields , less than @xmath52  t. this is to be compared with the field along the @xmath13 axis , @xmath53  t , that is required to induce the ci transition studied previously . since @xmath54 , we can conclude that for a horizontally applied field the rotation of @xmath55 occurs in fields that are an order of magnitude smaller than the dzyaloshinskii energy .    in the following discussion it is convenient to introduce notations for some angles in our experiment ( fig .",
    "[ notation ] ) .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath21 the angle between the magnetic field @xmath4 and the @xmath22 $ ] direction in the crystal .",
    "@xmath56 will stand for the angle between @xmath57 $ ] and @xmath49 . using @xmath22 $ ] as",
    "a reference is very convenient since i ) @xmath58 for @xmath59 and ii ) the principal axes of the square - lattice arrangement of the magnetic cu sites in ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 are along @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] , respectively . in these terms , for @xmath60 , as @xmath61 is increased , @xmath56 continuously increases from @xmath62 to @xmath63 .    for several directions of the magnetic field",
    "we have performed careful measurements of @xmath64 .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ angles ] .",
    "measurements with @xmath65 were done on the magnetic satellites around the @xmath46 af zone - center , and those around @xmath66 were used for higher values of @xmath21 .",
    "this was necessary to work around the geometrical constraints set by the cryostat windows .",
    "as mentioned , for @xmath60 the propagation vector starts out at @xmath58 for @xmath59 and rotates all the way towards the field direction ( @xmath67 ) , as in the case of fege . for arbitrary field direction",
    "though , while @xmath56 levels off above @xmath68  t , it does so at a smaller value , i.e. , before @xmath49 reaches the direction of applied field .",
    "if we plot @xmath56 measured at a relatively high field ,",
    "@xmath69  t , we find that the saturation value for @xmath56 is always @xmath70 ( fig .",
    "[ linear ] ) .",
    "thus at high fields the @xmath46 vector always bisects the angle formed by the magnetic field @xmath4 and the propagation vector @xmath49 .",
    "note that in all cases we have @xmath71 .",
    "if the magnetic field forms a smaller angle with the @xmath22 $ ] direction , the magnetic domain with propagation vector @xmath72 , @xmath73 is destroyed , and the diffraction intensity completely shifts over into the @xmath74 domain , returning us to the situation when @xmath21 is effectively greater than @xmath63 .",
    "this fact has been verified experimentally .",
    "an important experimental result is that for all directions and of the applied magnetic field the length of the magnetic propagation vector @xmath75 is only weakly field - dependent .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ trajectory ] that shows the trajectory traced by the propagation vector in reciprocal space as the magnetic field is increased .",
    "for @xmath60 this trajectory is an almost perfect circular arc that starts out at @xmath58 and continues all the way to @xmath76 [ fig .",
    "[ trajectory](a ) ] . for arbitrary @xmath21",
    "we see that @xmath77 is indeed slightly field - dependent and the trajectory has a characteristic s - shape .",
    "this , however , is a weak effect , barely detectable with the precision of our experiment , limited by the @xmath78-resolution of the spectrometer .",
    "having discussed the field - dependence of the propagation vector , we now turn to that of the spin orientation . typically to solve the magnetic structure one has to measure the intensities of several bragg peak . in the present experiment , however , we did not have this luxury .",
    "the severe geometrical constraints imposed by the narrow cryostat windows eliminate simultaneous access to several magnetic peaks .",
    "many of these could be observed by rotating the sample within the magnet , however , in this case the direction of the magnetic field relative to the sample is changed . only in the case of @xmath60 , thanks to the presence of two orthogonal pairs of windows , could we simultaneously observe more than one set of magnetic satellites , namely those around @xmath46 and @xmath79 .",
    "the intensities of these reflections are plotted against @xmath61 in fig .",
    "[ intensity ] for @xmath60 .",
    "these data are not sufficient to independently determine the magnetic structure for each value of applied field .",
    "we can however assume that for all cases , just as for @xmath59 , the spin arrangement is a flat magnetic spiral , with the normal to the spin rotation plane confined in the @xmath2 plane of the crystal .",
    "the assumption is quite reasonable if we consider that in our experiments @xmath80  t and @xmath81  mev , so the zeeman energy is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the exchange energy ( @xmath82  mev ) .",
    "a slight conical distortion of the planar spiral structure is of course inevitable in finite magnetic fields , but the tilt towards the direction of @xmath4 will remain very small . if we denote by @xmath83 the angle between @xmath22 $ ] and @xmath84 , the normal to the spin rotation plane ( @xmath85 for @xmath59 ) , the intensities of magnetic satellites around @xmath46 and @xmath79 are determined by the spin polarization factors in the neutron diffraction cross - section : @xmath86 from fig .  [ intensity ] we see that at high fields @xmath87 increases by roughly a third of its original value , while @xmath88 decreases by roughly the same amount . this observation is consistent with @xmath89 at high fields , as could be expected : a sufficiently strong magnetic field will always align the spin rotation plane perpendicular to itself , independent of the field direction . for arbitrary @xmath21",
    "we therefore expect @xmath90 in sufficiently high fields .",
    "experimentally , for all directions of magnetic field studied , this rule was found to be consistent with the observed intensity increase in the satellites around @xmath46 or @xmath66 that occurs upon increasing the magnetic field from @xmath59 to @xmath69  t.    as will be discussed in detail in the next section , theory predicts that for _ arbitrary _ values of @xmath61 one has @xmath91 since @xmath64 is directly measured in our experiments , we can plot the expected field dependencies of @xmath87 and @xmath88 using eqs.([inten ] ) and ( [ rule ] ) .",
    "these are shown in solid lines in fig .",
    "[ intensity ] and are reasonably consistent with experimental data",
    ".    we can now summarize all the experimental results in a short list of `` rules '' : i ) as the magnetic field is increased , @xmath49 rotates in reciprocal space for small @xmath61 , but slows down and eventually stops for @xmath92  t ; ii ) @xmath75 is only weakly field - dependent ; iii ) at high fields the @xmath51 $ ] direction bisects the angle formed by the vectors @xmath4 and @xmath49 ; iv ) at high fields @xmath84 is pointing along the direction of applied field ; and v ) it appears that for arbitrary @xmath61 the @xmath51 $ ] direction always bisects the angle formed by the vectors @xmath49 and @xmath84 .",
    "we shall now demonstrate that the observed behavior can be well understood using a generalization of the approach that we have previously employed to quantitatively analyze the dzyaloshinskii transition in ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "while in our previous studies the direction of the propagation vector remained constant , which enabled us to use an effectively 1-dimensional model , in the present experiment @xmath49 rotates in the @xmath2 plane , and we have to extend our expression for the free energy of the spin structure to work in 2 dimensions .",
    "in general , any almost - antiferromagnetic spin structure can be described in terms of the unit vector @xmath93 of local staggered magnetization .",
    "this is the continuous - limit , when nearest- neighbor spins are almost antiparallel and , in consequence , the magnetic propagation vector is close to that of a nel structure . for a `` relativistic '' spiral , such as the one in ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1",
    ", the continuous approximation is expected to work well when @xmath94 , @xmath95 , a condition well satisfied in our experiments .",
    "the simplest form of the free energy that for @xmath59 gives a planar spin spiral with propagation vector along @xmath34 and the spins rotating in the @xmath96 plane , is @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the temperature dependent spin stiffness ( see refs .  ) , @xmath99 ( @xmath100 being the lattice constant ) is the nearest neighbor cu - cu distance , and @xmath101 is the angle by which spins are rotated at one step of the spiral . for the `` relativistic '' spiral in ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 , @xmath102 . of course",
    ", on a square lattice the spiral can equally well propagate in the direction of the symmetrically equivalent @xmath35-axis ( with spins rotating in the @xmath103 plane ) , and a similar term where @xmath35 is interchanged with @xmath34 has to be added to the free energy functional . the purely ferromagnetic interactions between the cu - layers in ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 ( ref .  ) can be accounted for by including the term @xmath104 , where @xmath105 is the spin stiffness anisotropy factor , @xmath106 for ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
    "finally , the interaction with external magnetic field is given by the zeeman term @xmath107 $ ]  ( for details see refs .  ) .",
    "in this last expression @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the longitudinal and transverse local staggered susceptibilities of the almost af spin structure , respectively . for the classical spin model at @xmath110 one",
    "gets @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "combining all of the above terms gives us the simplest expression for the free energy per cu - plane , that is consistent with symmetric properties of the system and gives the `` right answer '' for @xmath59 : @xmath113 \\label{free}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]      let us first consider the system in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "we want to find a solution for a _ general _ direction of the propagation vector in the @xmath114 plane . for the case",
    "when @xmath49 forms the angle @xmath56 with the @xmath34-axis it is convenient to change the coordinate system to @xmath115 with @xmath116 along the propagation vector , @xmath117 perpendicular to @xmath116 in @xmath114 plane , and @xmath118 .",
    "the derivatives and unit vectors are changed according to : @xmath119 with these expressions eq .",
    "( [ free ] ) after some algebra can be rewritten as : @xmath120 \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath59 , since we have selected @xmath116 to be the direction of the propagation vector , @xmath121 , while @xmath122 .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that the above expression is minimized when i ) @xmath93 is periodic with the period @xmath123 and ii ) along its vector of propagation @xmath124 uniformly rotates in a plane that is perpendicular to @xmath125 , i.e. , the `` bisection rule ''",
    "@xmath126 formulated in the previous section is satisfied .",
    "in zero external field all spiral structures that conform with this bisection rule are degenerate , i.e. , they have the _ same _ free energy .",
    "it is now easy to understand what happens in the case @xmath127 .",
    "from all the possible spiral structures , energetically degenerate at @xmath59 , the system will pick the one that takes the most advantage of the zeeman energy @xmath128 , namely that which has its spin plane normal to the field direction .",
    "independent of the value of @xmath61 ( always assuming @xmath129 ) , instead of two equivalent domains seen at @xmath59 one gets a single domain with @xmath130 and @xmath90 .",
    "the particular case of @xmath131 is of special interest . in this case",
    "the propagation vector is also directed along @xmath132 and one has a `` screw - type '' spiral with all spins perpendicular to the propagation axis .",
    "such a `` screw - type '' structure is realized in mnsi and fege for arbitrary direction of @xmath49 .    while the above result accounts for the experimentally observed behavior for @xmath92  t , we still have to explain why the rotations of the spin plane and the propagation vector are continuous and in small fields some intermediate structure is realized .",
    "obviously this is due to some anisotropy effects that pick the propagation vector along @xmath22 $ ] ( or @xmath44 $ ] ) and the normal to the spin plane along @xmath36 $ ] ( or @xmath22 $ ] ) for @xmath59 in the first place .",
    "the most likely source of anisotropy is spin - orbital interaction .",
    "for the present discussion however , the actual origin of magnetic anisotropy is of little importance : we can take it into account by introducing a phenomenological term into eq .",
    "( [ free ] ) .",
    "this is done under the assumption that the anisotropy energy @xmath133 , as well as the zeeman energy @xmath134 , are much smaller than the energy scales of dzyaloshinskii or exchange interactions .",
    "neither magnetic field , nor anisotropy can distort any of the planar spiral structures in this limit .",
    "their only effect is to pick the one that gives the greatest gain in zeeman and anisotropy energies .",
    "@xmath133 can now be written as a function of @xmath135 or @xmath56 , which is in essence the same thing , since for all the structures we are dealing with @xmath136 . since at @xmath59 we know from experiment that @xmath85,@xcite the anisotropy term must be a minimum at this point .",
    "it must also comply with the 4-fold symmetry of the crystal , i.e. , it must be invariant under @xmath137 .",
    "in the most general case it is written as @xmath138 .",
    "it is also convenient to rewrite the zeeman energy in terms of @xmath56 and @xmath21 : @xmath139 . minimizing @xmath140 with respect to @xmath135",
    "we obtain : @xmath141 or , substituting @xmath126 , @xmath142 this expression gives us the direction of the propagation vector and the orientation of the spin rotation plane for arbitrary @xmath61 .",
    "we can now verify that the analytical results obtained in the previous section are consistent with our experiments on ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 . to begin with",
    ", all the approximations that were made in the above calculations are justified .",
    "indeed , the anisotropy energy in ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 corresponds to magnetic fields of several tenths of a tesla , fields in which the propagation vector actively rotates .",
    "the energy of dzyaloshinskii interactions , as previously mentioned , corresponds to fields of the order of @xmath143  t , while the exchange energy is roughly 10 times as large .",
    "equation  ( [ answer ] ) can be directly used to fit the experimentally measured @xmath64 .",
    "the solid lines in fig .",
    "[ angles ] are the result of a _ global _ fit of this expression to all our data collected at different @xmath21 .",
    "the only adjustable parameter was the anisotropy coefficient @xmath144 , while we assumed @xmath145 .",
    "the refined value for @xmath146 is @xmath147  t@xmath148 .",
    "the accuracy of the single - parameter fit is quite remarkable .",
    "it is interesting to note that our theory predicts qualitatively different behaviors for the cases of @xmath60 and @xmath149 , which is particularly easy to understand in the case @xmath150 . for @xmath60 eq .",
    "( [ answer ] ) turns into @xmath151 .",
    "we see that @xmath64 changes continuously for @xmath152 , has a kink at this value and remains constant ( equal to @xmath63 ) above this threshold .",
    "on the other hand , for @xmath153 the @xmath56 approaches @xmath70 asymptotically in high fields , @xmath64 is a smooth function and there is no threshold field .",
    "precisely this kind of behavior is observed in experiment ( fig .  [ angles ] ) .",
    "the limited data that we have for the orientation of the spin plane are also totally consistent with theory .",
    "the only effect that our theoretical model fails to account for is the observed slight variation of @xmath75 .",
    "this phenomenon may be a result of corrections to the continuous - limit approximation that we have ignored .",
    "alternatively , it may be a purely quantum effect , related to the small value ( @xmath154 ) of spins involved and the quasi-2-dimensional nature of the system .",
    "again we emphasize the key difference between fege and mnsi on one side , and ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 on the other . in the former two systems the dzyaloshinskii vector is pointing along the bond between interacting spins , while in ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 @xmath7 is orthogonal to this bond . as a result , in fege the normal to the spin plane @xmath84 , and the propagation vector @xmath49 are always collinear .",
    "in contrast , in ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 this colinearity is replaced by the `` bisection rule '' : @xmath49 and @xmath84 form equal angles with the @xmath100 axis of the crystal , but are not colinear .    in conclusion , we believe that the present work gives a fairly complete picture of the rather exotic _ static _ magnetic properties of the square - lattice dzyaloshinskii - moriya antiferromagnet ba@xmath11cuge@xmath0o@xmath1 .",
