    "understanding how the electroweak higgs doublets of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) remain ` light ' @xmath6 within the framework of supersymmetric grand unified theories ( susy guts ) poses an important challenge for model builders . in supersymmetric trinification with gauge group @xmath7 , by imposing suitable discrete symmetries for instance , it is possible to protect the ew doublets from becoming superheavy without fine tuning [ 1 ] .",
    "the supersymmetric @xmath8-term of mssm arises from a higher order ( non - renormalizable ) term in the superpotential .",

    "we provide the details of this mechanism within the framework of g. what partially distinguishes this example from some previous work based on @xmath13 can be explained in terms of the parameter @xmath14 , where @xmath15 are the well known mass squared parameters of the tree level scalar potential of mssm , evaluated at the gut scale @xmath16 . in the simplest @xmath13 model",
    "@xmath5 is equal to unity , up to corrections of order @xmath17 , where 1 tev specifies the supersymmetry breaking scale . in the @xmath18 case",
    ", @xmath5 deviates from unity even in the supersymmetric limit due to the presence of a superpotential term which breaks pseudosymmetry at tree level .",
    "nonetheless , this leads to the desired higgs doublets [ 6 ] . indeed , in the absence of this additional term @xmath5 is unity , but then the top quark turns out to be massless at tree level which is unacceptable . in section 3",
    "we consider radiative ew breaking as well as the ensuing sparticle spectroscopy , focusing on @xmath5 very close to unity such that @xmath2 is of order unity .",

    "2 we illustrate the correlation between the input value of @xmath21 with the value of the parameter @xmath5 . here",
    "we have chosen @xmath111 and one finds that @xmath112 makes @xmath5 close to unity than say @xmath113 , with all other parameters held fixed .",

    "we see that to obtain @xmath124 with @xmath111 one requires @xmath119 to be as large as @xmath125 .",
    "note that if @xmath2 is too close to unity , the relation    m_t(m_t )  =  h_t(m_t)(174 ) may cause the top quark mass in the theory to come into conflict with the cdf / d0 values [ 8 ] .",
    "with @xmath126 a plot of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath86 is illustrated in fig .",
    "the results above essentially emerge due to the correlations enforced by the well known evolution equations for the parameters @xmath8 and @xmath95 [ see ref . 9 ] and are given here for completeness :    @xmath127    where @xmath128 .",
    "so far we have considered the variation of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath2 in a region where @xmath129 depends linearly on @xmath130 , namely where @xmath131 and is therefore neglected . nevertheless , as @xmath2 increases , @xmath132 begins to grow in relative importance and eventually plays a role in arresting the growth of @xmath129 as @xmath2 grows for fixed @xmath84 , eventually causing it to turn around .",
    "this is the reason why the quasi ` infrared fixed point ' prediction for @xmath133 ( with @xmath134 ) is significantly smaller than the corresponding prediction with @xmath135 . for each value of @xmath84 , with the favoured hierarchy corresponding to @xmath110 ,",
    "one can plot @xmath5 as a function of @xmath129 .",
    "the result is presented in fig .",
    "6 describing the correlation between @xmath129 and @xmath5 .",
    "the cross - over for the two contours @xmath136 shows that , provided the top is heavy enough , merely lowering @xmath84 will not suffice to enforce @xmath5 in the vicinity of unity .",
    "furthermore , from the preceding discussion , with @xmath137 one can not have a top quark heavier than 182 gev .",
    "the conclusion to be desired from fig .",
    "6 is that should the top weigh more than 180 gev , @xmath138 would be ruled out .",
    "if @xmath139 , we would be forced to have @xmath140 and @xmath141 . in this region",
    "the infrared prediction begins to be realized , whereby ever larger @xmath142 would be implied with a rapidly increasing lower bound on @xmath5 .",
    "we also note here that with @xmath143 and with the choice of parameters of fig .",
    "6 , the @xmath144 solution also satisfies the boundary condition of the ` minimal ' khler model , viz . ,",
    "@xmath145 .",
    "the main result to be drawn from figs .",
    "1 - 6 is that with @xmath5 sufficiently close to unity , the hierarchy @xmath146 is singled out . in particular for @xmath5 sufficiently close to unity @xmath147 , one finds that @xmath148 .",
    "it is reasonable to enquire if the ` small ' ( order unity ) @xmath2 region requires that @xmath5 also be close to unity .",
    "this turns out to be not the case . in figs .",
    "7a , b , c we show plots of @xmath5 versus @xmath22 for a typical choice of @xmath149 and @xmath84 , with @xmath2 varying between ` order unity ' to ` intermediate ' values . the parameter @xmath150",
    "we see from 7b , for instance , that @xmath5 can be large with @xmath151 .",
    "this is a result of the fact that the parameter @xmath152 estimated through its one - loop evolution equation suffers a change in sign as the ratio @xmath22 is varied from its phenomenologically allowed lower bound of -3 for such values of @xmath153 . for smaller values of @xmath153 , for instance 1.2 , such a sign shift occurs at values of this ratio smaller than 3 , which are phenomenologically excluded . furthermore , in order to demonstrate that these features are not a result of accidental correlations between the input parameters , we present in figs . 8 and 9 systematic studies of the variations of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath22 for differing choices of input parameters .",
    "these trends persist if @xmath154 and @xmath155 .",
    "an example is presented in fig . 10 .",
    "the phenomenological considerations are somewhat different in the event of large @xmath2 since the effects of @xmath132 and @xmath156 are no longer negligible which tends to make the lighter stau approach the mass of the lsp .",
    "naturally we require this scalar tau to be heavier than the lsp .",
    "furthermore , in this limit , due to the essential degeneracy of @xmath157 and @xmath158 , @xmath159 also tends to remain low .",
    "in fact in the limit that @xmath160 , such considerations play a crucial role in constraining regions of the parameter space[11 ] .",
    "it is no longer possible to choose @xmath119 to be ( much ) larger than @xmath103 , and the ratio @xmath22 is also forced to remain rather low .",
    "we have performed a search in the parameter space to minimize @xmath5 under these conditions .",
    "the result is displayed in fig .",
    "we present the variation of @xmath2 with @xmath5 , obtained by varying @xmath161 from @xmath162 to @xmath84 , with @xmath84 chosen to be sufficiently large ( = @xmath163 ) , such that @xmath129 lies between @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "the universal gaugino mass @xmath103 is chosen to be @xmath166 ( and @xmath167 ) in order to saturate the upper bound on the ( bino - like ) lightest neutralino mass of @xmath168 for this figure we obtain the minimum value of @xmath5 with @xmath169 , with the maximum realizable values of @xmath119 and the ratio @xmath22 consistent with the phenomenological requirements @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "what we find is that @xmath5 can not be smaller than about @xmath163 as we near the condition of exact yukawa unification @xmath172 . indeed",
    "if the exact yukawa unification condition is relaxed , there is considerable freedom in the ratio @xmath22 as well , and even in the large @xmath153 case @xmath5 can be just about as large as one wants like in the ` intermediate ' @xmath153 case .",
    "the idea that the electroweak higgs doublets of mssm may arise as ` pseudogoldstones ' of an underlying supersymmetric grand unified theory can be neatly realized within the framework of @xmath173 . in this work",
    "we have studied the implications when this idea is merged with that of radiative electroweak breaking . in particular , we have explored the constraints on the ` universal ' parameters @xmath90 and @xmath21 .",
    "an important lesson is that the low energy parameter @xmath2 can vary all the way from order unity to @xmath174 in this class of models .",
