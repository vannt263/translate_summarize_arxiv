    "<S> the star formation rate ( sfr ) is a fundamental property of galaxies and it is crucial to understand the build - up of their stellar content , their chemical evolution , and energetic feedback . </S>",
    "<S> the sfr of galaxies is typically obtained by observing the emission by young stellar populations directly in the ultraviolet , the optical nebular line emission from gas ionized by newly - formed massive stars , the reprocessed emission by dust in the infrared range , or by combining observations at different wavelengths and fitting the full spectral energy distributions of galaxies . in this brief review </S>",
    "<S> we describe the assumptions , advantages and limitations of different sfr indicators , and we discuss the most promising sfr indicators for high - redshift studies </S>",
    "<S> .    various sfr indicators are commonly used to measure the total rate of ongoing star formation of galaxies from samples at different redshifts ( often detected at different wavelengths ) . </S>",
    "<S> the basic goal is to identify emission from young stars ( tracing recent star formation in the last 10 to 100  myr ) , and avoid contamination from other sources , such as evolved stellar populations and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . </S>",
    "<S> common assumptions in these calibrations are that the sfr of the galaxy remains constant over a given timescale ( often about 100 myr ) , that the metallicity is solar , and that the stellar initial mass function ( imf ) is know , universal and fully sampled ( for extensive reviews , see ( * ? ? ? </S>",

    "<S> _ ultraviolet emission . </S>",
    "<S> _ the most direct sfr tracer is the ultraviolet ( uv ) emission emitted by young ob stars , and has the main advantage of being observable in the optical / near - ir bands at high redshift . </S>",
    "<S> the calibration of uv sfr indicators depends strongly on the top - end of the imf , stochasticity of the star formation history ( sfh ) , metallicity , and modelling of the emission by massive stars , which can be complicated by e.g. stellar rotation and binaries . </S>",
    "<S> the uv is strongly affected by dust attenuation , and while empirical methods to correct for this have been developed ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * meurer et al .  1999 ) ) , these methods may not be universally applicable ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * kong et al .  </S>",
    "<S> 2004 , dale et al .  2009 ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> _ recombination and forbidden lines . _ </S>",
    "<S> emission lines from gas ionised by the most massive stars trace current star formation on @xmath0  myr timescales . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic fluxes of hydrogen recombination lines are known ( from case b ) , making dust corrections easier . </S>",
    "<S> however , emission line based sfr indicators suffer from uncertainties related to modelling the most massive stars , stochasticity of sfhs and stochastic imf sampling at very low sfrs . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , underlying stellar absorption must be accounted for , as well as very high dust optical depths towards the star - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> finally , there are uncertainties related to possible leakage of ionising photons from hii regions and extra sources of gas excitation ( e.g.  shocks , agn ) .    _ infrared emission by dust . </S>",
    "<S> _ this traces dust - obscured star formation and is ideal for very dusty sources , or when only ir observations are available . </S>",
    "<S> the main uncertainty in calibrating this sfr indicator is the fact that dust can also be heated by old stellar populations ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * bendo et al .  </S>",
    "<S> 2010 , groves et al .  2012 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we must consider possible dust emission from an agn torus , variation of ir spectral shapes , and the fact that in many cases not all the emission by young stars is absorbed by dust in galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> _ multi - wavelength methods . </S>",
    "<S> _ in order to circumvent some of the limitations of monochromatic sfr indicators , ` hybrid ' sfr indicators have been extensively calibrated which combine direct uv ( or the h@xmath1 line ) with infrared ( or radio ) emission ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * calzetti et al .  2007 , kennicutt et al .  </S>",
    "<S> 2009 , hao et al .  </S>",
    "<S> 2011 , kennicutt & evans 2012 ) ) , to measure both the unobscured and dust - obscured star formation . </S>",
    "<S> another way to obtain the sfr of a galaxy is to combine all available multi - wavelength observations through spectral energy distribution ( sed ) modelling ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * da cunha et al .  2008 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> this method is applicable to a wide variety of galaxies , and has the advantage of breaking degeneracies between dust , age and metallicities , and simultaneously obtaining additional physical parameters such as the stellar mass and dust properties of the galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> this method is affected by uncertainties in stellar population modelling , and requires physically realistic descriptions of the sfhs of galaxies ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * pacifici et al .  2015 ) ) and of the dust attenuation and emission processes . </S>",
    "<S> given the multi - dimensionality and degeneracies in sed modelling , this method requires sophisticated ( e.g.  bayesian ) fitting techniques .    </S>",
    "<S> _ far - ir fine structure lines . _ </S>",
    "<S> a promising avenue for high - redshift studies is the calibration of sfr indicators based on fine structure lines such as [ cii]158@xmath2 m , which present the advantage of being mostly unaffected by dust and easily observable from the ground with modern ( sub-)millimetre facilities such as alma ( e.g.  ( * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * carilli & walter 2013 ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> these lines are major coolants of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , and should correlate with heating , i.e. sfr , however , calibrations are not straightforward and are still ongoing ( e.g.  ( * ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ; * ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> * ota et al .  2014 , </S>",
    "<S> herrera - camus et al .  2015 ) ) . </S>"
