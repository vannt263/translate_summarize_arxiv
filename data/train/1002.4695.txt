    "it is well known that entanglement of quantum states is an important physical resource in the context of the quantum information theories .",
    "it plays a crucial role in quantum teleportation@xcite , superdense coding@xcite , quantum cloning@xcite , quantum cryptography@xcite and quantum computer technology@xcite .",
    "therefore , to understand how to quantify and how to characterize the entanglement for a given quantum state is an highly important physical task .",
    "many entanglement measures have been developed for last few years .",
    "above all , in our opinion , the most important entanglement measure is a distillable entanglement@xcite , which quantifies how many maximally entangled states can be constructed from the copies of the given quantum state in the asymptotic region .",
    "the importance of the distillable entanglement arises due to the fact that the entanglement is fragile when noises interfere the quantum information processing .",
    "the disadvantage of the distillable entanglement is its calculational difficulty . in order to compute the distillable entanglement",
    "analytically we should find the optimal purification ( or distillation ) protocol .",
    "if this optimal protocol generates @xmath2 maximally entangled states from @xmath3-copies of the quantum state @xmath0 , the distillable entanglement for @xmath0 is given by is divided into @xmath4 and @xmath5 depending on one - way and two - way classical communications . throughout this paper",
    "we only consider the two - way classical communication . ]",
    "@xmath6 however , finding an optimal purification protocol is an highly non - trivial task .",
    "it makes it difficult to compute the distillable entanglement analytically .",
    "fortunately , the tight upper bound of the distillable entanglement has been developed in ref.@xcite . in these references the new entanglement measure called relative entropy of entanglement ( ree ) was introduced .",
    "it is defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a set of separable states and @xmath9 is a quantum relative entropy - i.e .",
    ", @xmath10 .",
    "it was shown in ref.@xcite that @xmath11 is a upper bound of the distillable entanglement .",
    "subsequently , rains@xcite has shown that @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a set of positive partial transposition ( ppt ) states , is more tight upper bound when @xmath0 is an higher - dimensional bipartite state .",
    "using the facts that the ree is an upper bound of the distillable entanglement and smolin state@xcite is a bound entangled state , the distillable entanglement for the various bell - state mixtures has been analytically computed@xcite . in order to understand the distillable entanglement more deeply ,",
    "therefore , it is important to develop the various techniques for the explicit computation of the ree . of course , regardless of the distillable entanglement , the development of the calculation technique for the ree itself is important to understand the characterization of entanglement more profoundly .",
    "for last few years many properties of the ree were investigated@xcite .",
    "furthermore , recently relation between the ree and other distance measures has been studied@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we confine ourselves to the ree when @xmath0 is two - qubit states - i.e . , @xmath14 . since there is no bound - entangled state in this case , @xmath15 and @xmath16 defined in eq.([ree-1 - 1 ] ) and eq.([ree-1 - 2 ] ) are same .",

    "we have to find the reverse process of ref.@xcite in order to derive the closed formula of the ree for the arbitrary two - qubit state @xmath0 as wootters@xcite has done in the entanglement of formation .",
    "unfortunately , still it is an unsolved problem@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we will explore the reverse process of ref.@xcite .",
    "we will show that the reverse process of ref.@xcite is possible , at least , for the bell - diagonal , generalized vedral - plenio , and generalized horodecki states .",
    "we present a method for finding the corresponding css systematically for these states by generalizing the geometrical method discussed by horodecki in ref.@xcite .",
    "we also discuss why it is difficult to find the css for the arbitrary two - qubit mixed states from the geometrical point of view .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we will show how to find the css for the bell - diagonal states . in section iii",
    "we discuss how the geometrical objects presented in ref.@xcite such as tetrahedron @xmath28 and octahedron @xmath29 are deformed in the presence of the non - zero bloch vectors . in section iv and section v we present a method for finding the corresponding css for the generalized vedral - plenio and generalized horodecki states , respectively . in section",
    "vi we discuss why it is very difficult task to find the css for the arbitrary two - qubit states from the geometrical point of view . in section vii",
    "a brief conclusion is given .",
    "in this section we show how to find the css when @xmath0 is the bell - diagonal state from the geometrical point of view .",
    "in fact , this problem was already solved in ref.@xcite long ago .",
    "the reason why we re - consider the same problem is to stress the geometrical analysis .",
    "an arbitrary two - qubit state can be represented as follows : @xmath30,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are bloch vectors and @xmath33 is usual pauli matrix .",
    "the coefficients @xmath34 form a real matrix and represent the interaction of the qubits .",
    "if state @xmath0 is explicitly given , one can derive the bloch vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 and the correlation tensor @xmath35 as follows : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "it is well known that an appropriate local unitary ( lu ) transformation of @xmath0 can make @xmath34 to be diagonal ( see appendix of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "since entanglement is invariant under the lu transformation , it is in general sufficient to consider the case of diagonal @xmath34 for the discussion of entanglement .",
    "thus , without loss of generality , one can express @xmath0 as @xmath39.\\ ] ] if @xmath40 , where @xmath41 it is easy to show that the corresponding bloch vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 are vanishing and the corresponding correlation tensor @xmath34 become @xmath42 if , therefore , @xmath0 is bell - diagonal state , the bloch vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 are always null vectors .    since we are considering on the diagonal case of the correlation tensor , we will regard , from now on , the tensor as a vector , whose components are equal to the diagonal elements . when @xmath43 , horodecki has shown in ref.@xcite that the total two - qubit states belong to the tetrahedron @xmath28 with vertices @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 in the correlation vector space .",
    "ref.@xcite also has shown that the separable states ( with @xmath43 ) belong to the octahedron @xmath29 with vertices @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this is pictorially represented in fig . 1 .    as fig .",
    "1 shows , the planes @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are parts of the planes @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , respectively , @xmath56 , @xmath57 and @xmath58 are @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "it is easy to show that these plane equations are the same planes with the planes @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 , respectively . ] .",
    "therefore , all entangled bell - diagonal mixtures belong to the small four tetrahedra @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "now , we show how to perform the reverse process of ref.@xcite when @xmath0 is an entangled bell - diagonal state .",

    "now , let us consider the case where @xmath1 belongs to other surface .",

    "the non - maintenance of the property ( ii ) can be proved on the analytical ground by making use of the simpler model .",
    "let us consider @xmath149 in eq.([theorem-3 - 5 ] ) and @xmath233 in eq.([theorem-3 - 6 ] ) .",
    "then , the bloch vectors @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the correlation vector @xmath221 of @xmath233 are @xmath96 , @xmath97 and @xmath234 , where @xmath235 of course , if we take @xmath236 limit in eq.([property2 - 1 ] ) , the corresponding quantities are the bloch vectors and the correlation vector of @xmath149 .",
    "now , let us consider another state @xmath237 , which can be obtained from @xmath149 by changing @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "in order to ensure that @xmath237 is css we require @xmath240 and @xmath241 .",
    "then , the set of the entangled states @xmath242 , whose css are @xmath237 , can be obtained from @xmath233 by changing @xmath238 , @xmath239 and @xmath243 .",
    "thus , bloch vectors @xmath244 , @xmath245 and correlation vector @xmath246 of @xmath242 are @xmath247 , @xmath248 and @xmath249 , where @xmath250 then , it is straightforward to show that the condition @xmath251 imposes @xmath252 where @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "thus , one can compute the crossing point @xmath255 , where @xmath256 becomes @xmath257    as a special case we consider the bell - diagonal case by letting @xmath258 , @xmath259 , @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "of course , one can show directly that @xmath233 and @xmath262 are really bell - diagonal states . using the normalization conditions @xmath263 , it is easy to verify that the crossing point @xmath264 is simply @xmath265 and @xmath266 , which is one of the vertices of @xmath28 .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that the crossing point is independent of particular choice of bell - diagonal states @xmath233 and @xmath262 .",
    "this fact implies that all straight lines , which connect @xmath170 and @xmath221 , pass one of the vertices of @xmath28 , which is consistent with theorem 2 .",
    "however for the arbitrary mixtures eq.([property-2 - 4 ] ) implies that the crossing point @xmath267 is dependent on the choice of the entangled states @xmath233 and @xmath262 .",
    "this is why the nice property ( ii ) , which holds for the bell - diagonal , generalized vp , and generalized horodecki states , does not hold for the arbitrary mixture as fig .",
    "7 has indicated . in order to , therefore , derive the closed formula of @xmath268 for the arbitrary two - qubit mixtures @xmath0 , we have to understand how the property ( ii ) is modified when @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath221 are arbitrary .",
    "unfortunately , still this is an unsolved problem too .",
    "in this paper we have considered how to find the css in the two - qubit system from the geometrical point of view . of course",
    ", one can straightforwardly compute the ree of the state @xmath0 if its css is found .",
    "therefore , it is important to develop a technique for finding css to overcome the calculational difficulty of the ree . since , furthermore , the ree is a tight upper bound of the distillable entanglement , finding css is also important to understand the nature of the optimal ( or near - optimal ) purification protocols .",
    "if @xmath0 is one of bell - diagonal , generalized vp , and generalized horodecki states , we have shown how to find the css of @xmath0 , _ say _",
    "@xmath1 , systematically by proving the following nice two properties : ( i ) the bloch vectors of @xmath1 are identical with those of @xmath0 .",
    "( ii ) the correlation vector of @xmath1 exactly corresponds to the crossing point between the line @xmath83 and the geometrical object @xmath107 . using these two properties",
    "it is straightforward to find the css of @xmath0 .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , however , these two nice properties are not maintained for the general two - qubit states .",
    "therefore , in order to derive the closed formula of @xmath268 for the arbitrary mixture @xmath0 we have to understand how these two properties are modified when bloch and correlation vectors of @xmath0 are arbitrary .",
    "the research into these issues is in progress and will be reported elsewhere",
    ".    another interesting issue , which we will go further , is to explore the ree and the distillable entanglement for the higher - qubit or qudit systems .",
    "few years ago , the analytical expressions of the distillable entanglement are obtained for some higher - dimensional bipartite states@xcite .",
    "authors in those references used the upper - bound criterion @xmath269 and separability property of the smolin s",
    "unlockable state@xcite in various cuts .",
    "we would like to modify eq.([one - parameter-1 - 1 ] ) to be applicable not only for low - rank @xmath17 but also for higher - dimensional system .",
    "if the generalization of eq.([one - parameter-1 - 1 ] ) is possible , we can use it to compute the ree and the distillable entanglement for many more higher - dimensional states .",
    "it may enable us to understand the nature of the optimal ( or near - optimal ) purification protocols .",
