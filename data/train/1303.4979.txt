    "in a frequentist interpretation , the probability of an event is defined as its asymptotic relative frequency in a large number of independent experiments . in modern axiomatic probability theory ,",
    "this interpretation is reflected in various forms of the law of large numbers .",
    "we refer the reader to any standard text book of probability theory for a technical discussion of these topics and to @xcite for a more philosophical account .",
    "frequentism suggests that a sequence of @xmath2 independent experiments with individual probability of success @xmath3 ( such as the tossing of a biased coin ) , would yield , on average , @xmath4 successes .",
    "this is reflected by the fact that the number of successes in this setup follows a @xmath5 binomial distribution which assigns probability @xmath6 to the event of observing @xmath7 successes , and has expected value @xmath4 . in a genuinely frequentist approach , these probabilities should be interpreted , again , as limits of relative frequencies .",
    "more precisely , if the sequence of @xmath2 independent experiments were to be repeated , independently , @xmath8 times , then , on average , one would observe @xmath9 runs with @xmath7 successes .",
    "in fact , for each @xmath10 , the number of runs with exactly @xmath7 successes follows a @xmath11 binomial distribution , which is defined by the probabilities @xmath12 of observing @xmath13 runs with @xmath7 successes .",
    "iteration of this process leads to the recursive definition @xmath14    in the following we restrict our attention to the special case where the numbers @xmath15 are all equal to some @xmath1 and the numbers @xmath16 are equal to the expected number of successes at stage @xmath17 , i.e.  @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and so on . the numbers @xmath16 will not , in general , be integers , unless @xmath3 is rational and @xmath1 is sufficiently large .",
    "this could be remedied by considering the integer closest to @xmath16 instead , but we will not do that here .",
    "the subject of the paper is an asymptotic analysis of the array of numbers @xmath20 defined recursively by @xmath21 and @xmath22 surprisingly , these numbers do not seem to have received any attention in the past .",
    "they arise very naturally , however .",
    "they are the probabilities that , in a nested series of bernoulli experiments , the number of successes coincides at each stage with the expected number of successes .",
    "classically , the binomial coefficient @xmath23 is defined for positive integers @xmath24 by the formula @xmath25 .",
    "we extend this definition to the case of real numbers by replacing the factorials in the denominator by gamma functions , i.e.  @xmath26 , @xmath27 . for two sequences @xmath28 , @xmath29 of positive real numbers we write @xmath30 if @xmath31 .    with the following result",
    "we initiate the study of the probabilities @xmath20 .",
    "[ thm - k - fixed ] for every positive integer @xmath17 and every @xmath32 , there exist @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that @xmath35 as @xmath36 . the numbers @xmath33 are given by @xmath37^{(-1/2)^k}$ ] .",
    "the rates @xmath34 do not depend on the initial value @xmath21 and are given by @xmath38/3 $ ] ; in particular , @xmath33 and @xmath34 converge to @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "interestingly , the rates @xmath34 are related to the well - known jacobsthal numbers @xmath41 ( http://oeis.org/a001045[oeis a001045 ] ) via @xmath42 .",
    "the trivial cases @xmath43 are easily dealt with separately and are seen to lead to @xmath44 . in the next result",
    "we look at the array @xmath45 from a different angle and consider the case where @xmath17 tends to infinity while @xmath1 is held constant .",
    "[ thm - n - fixed ] for every positive integer @xmath1 and every @xmath32 , the probabilities @xmath20 converge , as @xmath46 , to a limit @xmath47 .",
    "this limit is independent of @xmath3 and is characterised by being the unique solution of the fixed - point equation @xmath48 furthermore , @xmath49 , as @xmath36 .",
    "in this section we present proofs of [ thm - k - fixed ] and [ thm - n - fixed ] .",
    "we will repeatedly use stirling s approximation for factorials ( or the gamma function ) .",
    "[ lem - stirling - approx ] for every positive integer @xmath1 , the factorial @xmath50 satisfies @xmath51 an analogous approximation holds for the gamma function @xmath52 . in particular , for every positive integer @xmath1 and every positive rational number @xmath53 not exceeding @xmath1 , the binomial coefficient @xmath54 satisfies @xmath55        induction .",
    "we first consider the base case . here , stirling s approximation ( [ lem - stirling - approx ] ) applied to [ eq - definition - pkn ] with @xmath56 shows that @xmath57 and thus @xmath58 with @xmath59 and @xmath60 . now , assuming that @xmath61 , we prove the corresponding statement for @xmath20 , @xmath62 . the same approximation as before , applied to [ eq - definition - pkn ] , yields @xmath63 which proves the first part of the theorem .",
    "it also shows that the numbers @xmath33 and @xmath34 satisfy the recursions @xmath64 which are easily solved by the reader s favourite method .",
    "we will prove the stronger claim that @xmath66 is log - convex .",
    "an easy calculation yields @xmath67,\\ ] ] where @xmath68 denotes the polygamma function of order @xmath69 .",

    "it is easily seen that both expressions are symmetric around @xmath73 and possess power series expansions around that point .",
    "more precisely , one finds that @xmath74 = & 2\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty{\\frac{n^{2i+1}}{(2i)!}\\psi^{(2i+1)}(n/2 + 1)\\left(p-1/2\\right)^{2i}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can thus prove the claim by arguing that , for every positive integer @xmath1 and every non - negative integer @xmath75 , @xmath76 it follows from ( * ? ? ?",

    "we establish conditions for a function @xmath81\\to[0,1]$ ] to have a unique fixed point , and for the fixed - point iteration to converge to this fixed - point from any starting value .",
    "notably , we do not assume that @xmath82 is a contraction .",
    "this fixed - point theorem will be the key ingredient in our proof of [ thm - n - fixed ] .",
    "[ lem - fixedpoint ] let @xmath81\\to[0,1]$ ] be a differentiable convex function such that @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "then @xmath82 has exactly one fixed point @xmath85 in @xmath86 .",
    "if , moreover , @xmath87 , @xmath82 is symmetric around @xmath88 and @xmath89 is such that either @xmath90 and @xmath91 , or @xmath92 then , for every @xmath93 , the sequence of function iterates @xmath94 converges to @xmath85 .    since @xmath95 and @xmath84",

    "uniqueness follows from the observation that @xmath104 and the fact that the convex function @xmath105 can have at most two zeros .    for the second part of the lemma we observe that the condition @xmath87 implies via banach s contraction principle ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.1 ) that there exists a neighbourhood @xmath106 of @xmath85 such that the iteration of @xmath82 on @xmath106 converges to @xmath85 .",
    "we can thus define @xmath107 as the maximal interval containing @xmath106 with the property that the iteration of @xmath82 on @xmath108 converges to @xmath85 .",
    "we will show that @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "it is clear from the continuity of @xmath82 that @xmath108 is open . by definition ,",
    "the image of @xmath108 under @xmath82 is contained in @xmath108 , and since @xmath108 is maximal the images of the boundary points @xmath111 , @xmath112 are not elements of @xmath108 .",
    "this implies that @xmath113 .",
    "since @xmath114 would imply the contradiction that @xmath115 , we have @xmath116 .",
    "we therefore need to rule out the possibility @xmath117 so that it will follow that @xmath118 and thus @xmath110 and @xmath109 .",
    "we first consider the case @xmath119 , which implies @xmath120 and @xmath121 . to see this , we observe that the sequence @xmath122 of even function iterates is a decreasing sequence and bounded from below , and therefore converges to , say , @xmath123 , which is a fixed point of @xmath124 .",
    "the condition @xmath91 implies that @xmath124 has only one fixed point in @xmath86 and since @xmath85 is a fixed point of @xmath124 , it follows that @xmath125 and @xmath121 .",
    "hence , by the symmetry of @xmath82 , the maximal interval @xmath107 is symmetric around @xmath88 and one has @xmath126 .",
    "this implies that @xmath127 can not equal @xmath111 because otherwise @xmath128 .",
    "the argument is similar for the case @xmath129 except that no assumption on @xmath130 is necessary to conclude that @xmath121 .",
    "we first observe that the functions @xmath66 satisfy @xmath133 and apply [ lem - convexity , lem - fixedpoint ] to conclude that they possess a unique fixed point @xmath47 . in order to establish the convergence @xmath134",
