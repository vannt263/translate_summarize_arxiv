    "they crystallize in ilmenite - type structure with the space group @xmath5 .",
    "planes formed of double sheets of triangular network of ni ( or co ) and ti cations are altered along the hexagonal @xmath6-axis and each cation is coordinated by six oxygen atoms which form a distorted octahedron .",

    "ni@xmath7 ( co@xmath7 ) moments , parallel to the planes ( the easy axis being perpendicular to the @xmath6-axis ) , are ferromagnetically coupled within each plane while the inter - plane coupling is antiferromagnetic @xcite .",
    "when ilmenite oxides form a solid - solution , complex and interesting magnetic properties emerge .",
    "an example is ( fe@xmath8co@xmath9)tio@xmath2 ( fct ) , where the spin arrangement of fetio@xmath4 ( fto ) is the same as that of nto except for the spin direction@xcite .",

    "the phase diagram of the concentration ( @xmath10 ) versus temperature ( @xmath11 ) given in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that there are three magnetically ordered phases with respect to the composition : two antiferromagnetic phases with different spin directions for co- and fe - rich areas and a mixed ordering , or oblique antiferromagnetic , phase in the vicinity of the fe@xmath12co@xmath12tio@xmath4 composition .",
    "the motivation for the present study is to look a solid - solution system closely related to fct but in which the two constituents have identical magnetic ordering .",
    "the study is dedicated on polycrystalline ( ni@xmath0co@xmath1)tio@xmath2 ( nct ) solid solutions .",
    "our experiments reveal that , despite identical spin structures of the constituents , magnetic properties of nct behave in a complicated manner .",
    "polycrystalline stoichiometric ( ni@xmath0co@xmath1)tio@xmath2 ( @xmath13 ) were prepared through the conventional solid - state technique .",

    "magnetization measurements were performed by a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid ) magnetometer ( quantum design xl7 ) .",
    "dc magnetization in zero - field - cooled ( zfc ) and field - cooled ( fc ) runs were carried out over the temperature range down to 5 k under various magnetic fields between 1 and 1000 oe .",
    "field - dependent magnetization data as a function of applied field were collected at various temperatures .",
    "ac magnetization measurements were performed with the heating rate of 0.8 k / min with 1 oe ac field amplitude .",
    "prior to measurements , sample was carefully centered with respect to pick - up coils and the centering was regularly monitored .",
    "residual magnetic field was estimated using a paramagnetic material prior to and after each measurement so that the real applied field is given .",
    "because of the similarity in the crystal structure and chemical character between nto and cto , one can expect solid solution with no miscibility gap for whole composition range .",
    "in fact , all solid - solutions in the tested composition range were obtained as single phase .",
    "figure [ xrd ] shows x - ray diffraction patterns of selected nct powders . the nct sample with lowest co content was light green in color and became dark with increasing co content .",
    "@xmath19 ( @xmath20 is odd ) reflections , such as 003 and 101 , indicative to the ilmenite phase @xmath5 .",
    "disappearance of these reflections implies a higher symmetry @xmath21 . for nto and cto , however , the @xmath19 peaks are usually rather weak and the degree of ordering could not be determined from the xrd data alone .",
    "the room - temperature x - ray diffraction also show that lattice parameters were increasing with increasing co - content , suggesting that co@xmath7 and ni@xmath7 were in a high - spin state ( their ionic radii are @xmath22  and @xmath23  , respectively@xcite , in contrast , the low - spin ionic radii of co@xmath7 is @xmath24 @xcite )",
    ". however , as the antiferromagnetic ordering temperatures of cotio@xmath4 and nitio@xmath4 demonstrate , the consideration of bond - lengths alone is insufficient for understanding the composition dependent magnetic transition temperatures .",

    "overall the magnetic properties of nct samples were quite similar : there are two magnetic transitions at around 23 and 67 k. the higher temperature transition is only characteristic to the solid - solutions . above this temperature , ncts were paramagnetic : the inverse susceptibility was linearly decreasing with decreasing temperature down to the transition temperature .    in the paramagnetic phase , susceptibility obeys the curie - weiss law .",
    "correspondingly , effective magnetic moments @xmath26 were estimated from the paramagnetic region data , as shown in table [ table1 ] . for comparison",
    ", the magnetic moment values were estimated from the equation based on the assumption of quenched orbital moments : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are total electron spin moment values of ni and co ions in their high - spin states , respectively .",
    "the difference between the magnetic moments estimated from the susceptibility data and the quenched orbital moment values became larger with increasing co content , suggesting that the orbital moments of co - ions were not entirely quenched .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic moment values of nitio@xmath4 @xcite and notably of cotio@xmath4 @xcite were larger than the values expected for quenched orbital moments . for comparison , also values based on the hund s rules",
    "are given in table [ table1 ] .",
    "also the co@xmath7 ions in lamn@xmath12co@xmath12o@xmath4 were found to possess a large orbital moment , which was predicted to result in a nontrivial temperature dependence of the magnetic susceptibility @xcite .",
    "the low temperature transition was close to the @xmath30 of nto .",
    "with increasing field , the cusp at around 27 k became sharper .",
    "the cusp is characteristic signal to a transition to an antiferromagnetic phase .",
    "the peak temperature of the cusp is referred to as @xmath31 .",
    "antiferromagnetic order is consistent with the negative values of asymptotic curie point @xmath32/k and the results of field dependent magnetization [ @xmath33 , as given in figs .",

    "magnetization was almost linearly dependent of the applied field , except for the small hysteresis loop which diminished significantly at 40 k and vanished above the high temperature transition .",

    ", @xmath31 almost linearly increased to 32 k. the linear increase of @xmath31 with increasing @xmath10 parallels with the linear increase of magnetic moment @xmath26 , see table [ table1 ] . despite the fact that the solid solution has larger number of magnetic interactions ( ni - ni , ni - co and co - co interactions in simplest terms ) than the parent compounds , it seems that the exchange integrals @xmath35 of different magnetic atom pairs are roughly the same , in contrast to ( fe@xmath8co@xmath9)tio@xmath2 or other spin glass compounds . for a typical spin glass material ,",
    "glass transition temperature declines when the composition approaches the intermediate region@xcite .",
    "this behavior is explained by random distribution of @xmath35 over magnetic ion pairs .",
    "we estimated the temperature at which the inverse dc susceptibility versus temperature curve starts to depart from the extrapolation of curie - weiss relation , the onset of a transition .",
    "hereafter this temperature is referred to as irreversible point @xmath36 .",
    "@xmath36 exhibited composition dependence : increasing co content pushed the transition temperature down .",
    "the decrease was not linear as a function of co content but was faster at highest co content so that @xmath36 decreased to 57 k for nc20/80 sample .",

    "in both cases , real and imaginary ac magnetization showed sharp peaks at the point corresponding to the high temperature transitions , see figs .",
    "[ nc55 ] and [ nc64 ] .",
    "@xmath31 also corresponds to the low temperature cusp of real part of ac magnetization curves .",
    "next we focus on the result of nc50/50 , although the discussion is valid to all nct solid - solutions .",
    "with increasing field , the difference between zfc and fc curves [ panels ( a ) , ( b ) , and ( c ) in fig . [ nc55 ] ] became smaller and the higher temperature transition slightly shifted to lower temperature , as was commonly observed in all other ncts .",
    "the higher temperature transition at which both the real and imaginary parts of ac magnetization curves show a peak is labeled as @xmath37 .",
    "we note that @xmath37 is slightly lower than @xmath36 , though they indicate the same magnetic transition . except for the peak at @xmath37 ,",
    "the imaginary part of magnetization was close to zero .",
    "a sharp peak in imaginary part generally indicates that magnetic domain structure with switchable magnetization is formed . on the contrary ,",
    "clear yet small hysteresis loop was observed only at low temperature : the net magnetization was largest at lowest temperature .",
    "thus , the dissipation peak at @xmath37 and the ferromagnetic hysteresis seem to be unrelated phenomena suggesting the different nature of the two phases . the small hysteresis loop can be explained by canting the antiferromagnetically ordered spins so that there is a small net magnetization .",
    "both dc and ac magnetization results of the low - temperature phase are consistent with the canted antiferromagnetic order .",
    "the difference in magnetic ordering was also reflected by the different shape of the magnetization versus applied field : whereas the lowest temperature curve had an s - shape , above @xmath38 the curve was pratically a straight line .",
    "the dissipation peak at @xmath37 suggests a formation of domains which are sufficiently large to show no frequency dependent response .",
    "consistently with the dc magnetization results , the @xmath37 , determined through the ac - measurements , was slightly shifted with increasing applied field .",
    "this suggests that the origin of the phenomena is on the collective spin ordering on the layers perpendicular to the hexagonal @xmath6-axis rather than magnetic nanodomains .",
    "specifically the high @xmath39 and the sensitivity to an applied field further implies that the magnetic phase transitions can be related to the in - plane spin order .",
    "the magnetization of the nc50/50 samples in zfc curve measured with weak field was negative up to @xmath37 , see panel ( a ) in fig .",
    "negative magnetization was also observed in the nc80/20 and nc60/40 .",
    "the temperature at which the sign of magnetization changes varied by the heating rate . to verify the time dependence of the magnetization , data were collected keeping the temperature constant at 12 and 40 k for 100 min in zfc run with weak external field , as shown in fig .",

[ nc55 ] ) contradict the characteristic feature of spin glass@xcite which displays a clear frequency dependence when a small field is applied : neither real or imaginary part of ac magnetization curves exhibited frequency dependence .",
