    "the spectral curve can be parametrised as @xmath170 with @xmath171 , and the relation between @xmath172 and the monopole separation will be clarified in section [ secmod ] .",
    "recall from section [ hyperbolicvortices ] that a centered charge @xmath5 hyperbolic vortex can be constructed from the @xmath173 symmetric blaschke product @xmath174 where vortex zeros are located at the critical points of @xmath15 and @xmath175 is related to @xmath176 by @xmath177 . restricting to the action of @xmath178 on the boundary , it is established in @xcite that @xmath178 is a surjection and that a point @xmath179 has exactly @xmath23 preimages @xmath180 , defining an ideal triangle .",
    "the edges of this triangle are spectral lines , a fact that is readily checked by direct computation in simple cases , or numerically for more generic values of the parameters .",
    "the prescribed blaschke product then generates all of the spectral lines ( with @xmath163 ) and hence a family of ideal triangles corresponding to the gauge freedom in the jnr data .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the envelope of this family of triangles is a hyperbolic ellipse ( the locus of points for which the sum of the geodesic distances from the foci is constant ) whose foci are at the critical points of @xmath178 , i.e.  at the vortex zeros . by euclidean triangles",
