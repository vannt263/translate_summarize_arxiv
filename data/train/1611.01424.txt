    "note that the unfolding move , mentioned above does not change the modular group , since the dehn - twists are not along elements of the edge group , but elements of the centralizer of the edge group in the vertex group , and these centralizers do not change under unfoldings .",

    ", there are only rigid vertices in the jsj decomposition .",
    "again it suffices to consider the jsj decomposition of @xmath8 relative @xmath11 .",
    "since @xmath270 for some basis @xmath64 of @xmath8 , @xmath8 admits in particular a relative splitting as in lemma [ lemma2 ] , i.e. a splitting which is of one of the three types in figure [ hnn - fall ] .",
    "but clearly the third type of splitting ( the one with two edges ) does not admit any further refinement of a vertex group as an amalgamated product , which contradicts our assumption . hence @xmath8 admits a splitting relative @xmath11 of the form : @xmath298 or @xmath299 for some maximal @xmath283 .",

    "we want to show that @xmath303 , so let @xmath69 be the graph of groups which we get by refining the vertex group in @xmath304 by @xmath305 and denote by @xmath213 the corresponding bass - serre tree . first we note that @xmath78 acts hyperbolically on @xmath213 , since otherwise @xmath306 and hence @xmath307 , a contradiction .",
    "as in the proof of lemma [ lemma1 ] we can without loss of generality deduce from theorem 1a in @xcite that either      but since @xmath78 acts hyperbolically , we are clearly in case @xmath225 . hence @xmath226",
    "acts elliptically on @xmath213 and therefore is either conjugate to an element of @xmath169 or conjugate to @xmath71 .",
    "+ so suppose that @xmath226 is not conjugate to @xmath71 , i.e. @xmath226 is conjugate into @xmath169 .",
    "then @xmath311 is the star of the vertex stabilized by @xmath169 and all other vertices of @xmath312 are stabilized by conjugates of @xmath169 , while the edges are stabilized by @xmath261 .",
    "clearly @xmath313 is of the same form . since @xmath314 we conclude that @xmath315 is an @xmath214-invariant subtree , a contradiction to the minimality of @xmath69 .",
    "hence @xmath226 is conjugate to @xmath71 and by the same arguments as in the amalgamated product case ( lemma [ lemma1 ] ) follows without loss of generality that @xmath303 and @xmath296 .",
    "hence @xmath8 has a relative splitting @xmath69 which is of one of the two types : + @xmath316 where @xmath296 , or @xmath317 where @xmath297 .",
    "since we have chosen @xmath318 maximal , by the same arguments as in the proof of lemma [ lemma1 ] @xmath69 has no further refinement , i.e. @xmath69 can not have one loop edge @xmath71 and two non - loop edges as in figure [ unmoglich ] .",
    "therefore the relative jsj decomposition of @xmath8 is of the form claimed above . to complete the proof that the jsj decomposition of @xmath7 has the desired form , it remains to consider qh vertices .",
    "we again only consider the case @xmath319 note that there exist @xmath320 such that @xmath321 and therefore by sliding the edge corresponding to the loop edge over the non - loop edge we get a graph of groups which has two vertices and two non - loop edges ( corresponding to hnn - extensions ) connecting these vertices .",
    "hence by the same arguments as in the hnn case ( lemma [ lemma2 ] ) , we conclude that the jsj decomposition is as claimed above , i.e. with only rigid vertices , if @xmath11 is not conjugate to @xmath322 and as in figure [ qh4 ] elsewise .",
