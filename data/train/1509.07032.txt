    "during the last decade there have been tremendous advances in the study of large complex networks ; see @xcite for surveys .",
    "empirical observations on real networks such as social contact structures , citation networks and the internet / world wide web have revealed that many networks share similar properties , in particular , they typically have power - law degree sequences , that is , the number of vertices with degree @xmath5 decays as an inverse power of @xmath5 ; see e.g. @xcite .",
    "one way of modeling networks is by using random graphs , and large efforts have been made to formulate graph models that can capture the properties of real networks .",
    "the classical erds - r ' enyi graph , see @xcite , is discarded in this context because of its much too simplified structure . a specific point where it fails to capture the empirical observations is the degree distribution ( which is a poisson distribution in the limit in the erds - r ' enyi graph ) . to obtain a richer structure ,",
    "the erds - r ' enyi model has been generalized in various ways , for instance by making the edge probabilities inhomogeneous , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "other model types that have been studied include the configuration model , see @xcite , and certain bipartite graphs , see @xcite .",
    "the models mentioned above are all static in the sense that the number of vertices is taken to be constant ( albeit large ) . in reality",
    "however many networks are dynamic : the number of vertices increases as new vertices arrive in the network and decays as vertices leave the network .",
    "a framework for growing networks , based on the idea that new vertices tend to connect to high - degree vertices rather than low - degree vertices , is provided by preferential attachment models , introduced in the context of complex network modeling by barabasi and albert @xcite in 1999 to describe the world wide web .",
    "barabasi and albert observed that such a mechanism leads to power - law degree sequences , and their findings have later been confirmed and elaborated on in @xcite .",
    "the model type has received a lot of attention , see e.g.  @xcite for surveys , and the growth mechanism has been generalized in various ways , see e.g.  @xcite for a very general version of the model .",
    "there is considerably less work on preferential attachment based models where edges and/or vertices also can be removed . in @xcite a model is studied where edges between existing vertices are added or removed each time a vertex is added .",
    "addition and deletion can however not be incorporated simultaneously in this model .",
    "later , cooper et al .",
    "@xcite and chung and lu @xcite have studied models where vertices and edges are deleted randomly , and shown that this leads to power - law degree sequences with exponents that depend on the addition / removal probabilities .",
    "furthermore , moore et al .",
    "@xcite and cami and deo @xcite analyze models where vertices are deleted .    in this paper",
    "we consider a model where edges can be deleted and new edges created between existing vertices , the deletion and addition of edges occurring at vertices chosen preferentially proportionally to their degree .",
    "the edge deletion / addition is hence done preferentially with a vertex focus : we pick the vertex to lose / gain an edge .",
    "this is intended to describe a scenario where high - degree vertices tend to have more dynamic connections as compared to low - degree vertices , that is , the connections of high - degree vertices are more prone to break , but high - degree vertices are also more likely to create new connections to existing vertices .",
    "it is not hard to come up with real networks where this is likely to be the case . in a social network for instance",
    ", very social individuals with a large number of contacts may have weaker bonds to their acquaintances as compared to individuals with very few contacts . on the other hand ,",
    "the fact that social individuals have many contacts makes it more likely for them to come in contact with other people in the population and create new bonds as well .    in order for the model to define a growing network , the edge removal probability , denoted by @xmath10 ,",
    "is assumed to be smaller than 1/2 .",
    "interestingly , it turns out that the model exhibits a transition at @xmath11 : for @xmath6 the expected degree distribution obeys a power - law with an exponent that diverges as @xmath10 approaches 1/3 , while , for @xmath8 , the degree distribution decays exponentially .",
    "there is hence a non - trivial limit for the removal probability above which the power - law behavior of the degrees is lost .",
    "furthermore , the exponent in the power - law regime of the model turns out to depend on the probability @xmath12 of adding a vertex and the probability @xmath2 of adding an edge between existing vertices only through their sum , that is , the relation between the vertex and the edge addition probabilities does not affect the tail behavior of the degree distribution ( although it does affect the mean degree of course ) .",
    "the model that we will consider is described by a graph process @xmath13 consisting of simple graphs , that is , graphs without self - loops and multiple edges .",
    "write @xmath14 and @xmath15 for the set of vertices and edges , respectively , in @xmath16 and let @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the graph @xmath19 is taken to be a graph consisting of two vertices connected by an edge and , for @xmath20 , the graph @xmath21 is constructed from @xmath16 in that one of the following three steps is carried out :    * with probability @xmath1 , a vertex with one edge attached to it is added to the graph .",
    "the edge is connected to an existing vertex @xmath22 with probability proportional to degree , that is , @xmath23 where @xmath24 denotes the degree of vertex @xmath25 in @xmath16 . * with probability @xmath2",
    ", an edge is added between a vertex chosen proportionally to its degree and another vertex chosen uniformly at random .",
    "if this results in a multiple edge between two vertices , the edges are merged . * with probability @xmath26 ,",
    "an edge is deleted from the graph in that a vertex is chosen proportionally to its degree and an edge chosen uniformly at random from the set of all edges incident to this vertex is removed .",
    "when @xmath27 , modifications of the rules are needed : for a step of type 1 , the edge is connected to a randomly chosen vertex , for a step of type 2 , an edge is added between two randomly chosen vertices and , for a step of type 3 , the graph is left unchanged . however , throughout , we will assume that @xmath28 so that the number of edges in the graph is indeed growing ( on average ) .",
    "this means that a graph without any edges occurs very rarely and how we deal with this case should not matter for the results derived here .",
    "indeed , the graph @xmath16 can have @xmath27 only if at least @xmath29 steps have been of type 3 and , for @xmath28 , the probability of this decays exponentially in @xmath30 . we can hence disregard this possibility in the below derivations .",
    "note that , when @xmath31 , a vertex that ends up having degree 0 at some point will , with a probability tending to 1 , keep on having degree 0 forever .",
    "when @xmath32 on the other hand , a vertex with degree 0 can acquire new edges ( by being selected as an endpoint of an edge added as a result of step 2 ) . also note that the step 3 is equivalent to deleting an edge uniformly at random from the set of edges : first a vertex @xmath25 is chosen with probability @xmath33 and then an edge incident with u is chosen randomly , that is , each incident edge has probability @xmath34 of being chosen .",
    "the probability that a given edge in the graph is chosen via any of its two endpoints is hence @xmath35 .",
    "write @xmath36 for the number of vertices with degree @xmath5 in @xmath16 and let @xmath37 $ ] denote mathematical expectation .",
    "assume that @xmath38/t$ ] converges to some limit @xmath4 as @xmath39 .",
    "in view of previous work on related models , e.g.  @xcite and @xcite , this assumption is indeed reasonable .",
    "it can presumably be confirmed rigorously by a more careful analysis of ( [ bet_vv ] ) along similar lines as in @xcite / t$ ] satisfies the recursion obtained from ( [ bet_vv ] ) conditional on that the number of vertices and edges respectively in the graph are concentrated around their means . with sufficient concentration bounds at hand it would then follow that the solution of the recursion , which we denote by @xmath4 , is a good approximation of @xmath38/t$ ] for large @xmath30 so that , in particular , @xmath38/t\\to p_k$ ] ; c.f .",

    "defining @xmath47 for all @xmath30 , we have @xmath48    here , in deriving the expression for @xmath49 , we have used the fact that the fraction of neighbors with degree @xmath5 of the vertex chosen in step 3 is given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the number of neighbors with degree @xmath5 of the vertex @xmath25 at time @xmath30 ( also recall that @xmath24 denotes the degree of @xmath25 at time @xmath30 ) . to obtain a recursion for @xmath4",
    ", we take expectation in ( [ bet_vv ] ) and let @xmath39 . ignoring the effects of merging multiple edges in step 2 and the modifications of the growth rule when @xmath27  indeed , both these phenomena are negligible in the limit of large @xmath30  we have that @xmath52 is a sum of @xmath30 independent identically distributed variables with mean @xmath53 .",

    "writing @xmath70 , this yields the equation @xmath71 , which is solved by @xmath72 and @xmath73 . here",
    "@xmath72 corresponds to a power - law tail , while , for @xmath74 , the latter solution corresponds to exponential decay at rate @xmath9 .",
    "we now analyze the solution of ( [ rec ] ) in more detail .",
    "the recursion formula ( [ rec ] ) is of second order and hence , imposing the two conditions @xmath75 and @xmath76 yields a unique solution .",

    "high - degree vertices hence tend to experience a higher versatility in their connections as compared to low - degree vertices . assuming that the expected number of vertices with degree @xmath5 converges to a limit @xmath4 as time goes to infinity , we have analyzed the behavior of @xmath4 as @xmath40 .",
    "it turns out that @xmath4 decays exponentially if the removal probability exceeds 1/3 , while it has a power - law tail for smaller values of the removal probability , the exponent going to infinity as the removal probability approaches 1/3 . since real networks",
    "typically exhibit power - law degree sequences ( with fairly small exponents ) this indicates that these networks are the outcomes of edge addition / deletion processes where the addition rate well exceeds the deletion rate .    as for future work",
    ", the results in the paper may be possible to make rigorous along similar lines as in @xcite .",
    "concentration results seem to be difficult to establish for preferential attachment models incorporating deletion , but some recently observed connections between preferential attachment models and branching processes in continuous time might be useful in this context",
    ". it would indeed also be interesting to study other versions of preferential attachment models that incorporate deletion of edges .",
    "one option would be to assign a random life - time to each edge that is added to the network and remove the edge when this time expires , generalizing the work in @xcite .",
    "one could also think of a rule where the probability of removing an edge is large just after the edge has been added , but then gradually decreases .",
    "this is to model a situation where the connections tend to stabilize  in a social network for instance , not all new acquaintances turn into long - term friends , but a relation that has lasted for a while may be more stable .    another line of investigation would be to look at dynamical features of the graph , such as for instance the evolution of the degree of a fixed vertex . as previously mentioned , the possibility for a vertex with degree zero of acquiring new edges depends on whether @xmath2 is zero or positive .",
    "it has been pointed out to us by an anonymous referee that this could lead to interesting differences in the behavior of the asymptotic degree of a fixed vertex in the exponential regime .",
    "this would be worthwhile to investigate further ."
