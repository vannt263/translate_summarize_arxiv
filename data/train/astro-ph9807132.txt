    "the _ sinusoidal _ or s - cepheids constitute about 30% of all galactic cepheids with periods below 5days .",
    "originally , they have been discriminated from other cepheids by qualitative criteria  their small amplitudes and almost sinusoidal light , color and radial velocity curves .",
    "a more precise , quantitative definition , based on the fourier decomposition of the light curves , has been introduced by antonello et  al.(@xcite ) .",
    "armed with this new classification tool , the italian group has identified 33 s - cepheids , plus several likely suspects ( antonello & poretti @xcite ; antonello et  al . @xcite ; mantegazza & poretti @xcite ; poretti @xcite ) .",
    "the physical nature of the s - cepheids has been a matter of debate .",
    "it has been suggested in the general catalog of variable stars that these stars are either fundamental - mode pulsators during the first crossing of the instability strip or , alternatively , first overtone pulsators .",
    "the latter view has been adopted by antonello et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "a different interpretation has been proposed by gieren et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who has argued that the short period s - cepheids pulsate in the first overtone , but that the long period ones ( @xmath6day ) are in fact fundamental - mode variables .",
    "the controversy has finally been settled with the massive photometry of the macho and eros , which has unambiguously shown that _ all _ s - cepheids pulsate in the overtone ( welch et  al .",
    "@xcite ; beaulieu et  al .",
    "independently , the first crossing hypothesis has been ruled out by the new spectroscopic abundance analysis ( kovtyukh et  al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the debate between antonello et  al . and",
    "gieren et  al .",
    "has been sparked off by the curious behavior of the s - cepheid fourier parameters .",
    "the light curve fourier phase @xmath0 ( cf .",
    "simon & lee @xcite ) , when plotted vs. pulsation period , shows a very deep and very abrupt drop in the vicinity of @xmath7day . at the same period the amplitude ratios @xmath8 and",
    "@xmath9 display a pronounced minimum .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of what is observed for the fundamental - mode cepheids at @xmath10day ( simon & moffett @xcite ) . in the latter case",
    "the characteristic variation of the fourier parameters has its origin in the 2:1 resonance between the fundamental mode and the second overtone ( simon & schmidt @xcite ; buchler et  al .",
    "@xcite ; kovcs & buchler @xcite ) .    by analogy , antonello & poretti ( @xcite ) and petersen ( @xcite )",
    "have proposed that the variations observed for the s - cepheid light curves are also caused by a resonance , namely the 2:1 coupling between the first and the fourth overtones . also by analogy , it has been assumed that the resonance center coincides with the drop of the photometric @xmath0 and therefore occurs at @xmath7day .    the resonance hypothesis ,",
    "although very attractive , has encountered serious difficulties , when confronted with hydrodynamical calculations .",
    "three sets of overtone cepheid models have been specifically computed to study the presumed resonance ( antonello & aikawa @xcite , @xcite ; schaller & buchler @xcite ) .",
    "to great disappointment , they have all failed to reproduce the properties of the s - cepheid light curves .",
    "the theoretical @xmath0 and @xmath8 display some features in the vicinity of @xmath7day but they are _ very far _ from reproducing what is actually observed .",
    "the discrepancy is even more embarrassing , when compared with the very good agreement obtained with the same codes for the fundamental - mode pulsators ( e.g. moskalik et  al .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "another potential problem has been pointed out by buchler et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) , who have considered the constraints imposed by resonances on the evolutionary mass - luminosity relation .",
    "their linear calculations show that the proposed s - cepheid resonance centered at 3.2day and the well established f - mode cepheid resonance at 10day can not be reconciled simultaneously with the same @xmath11 relation . for consistent picture",
    ", the s - cepheid resonance has to occur at @xmath12day .",
    "so far , the analysis of the s - cepheid pulsations has been performed almost exclusively in the photometry domain .",
    "this choice has been dictated by the lack of high quality @xmath13 data for these low amplitude stars .",
    "the only attempt to compare the s - cepheid velocity curves with the hydrodynamical models has been largely inconclusive ( antonello & aikawa @xcite ) .",
    "analyzing overtone cepheid velocity data is particularly desirable in light of the modeling difficulties discussed above .",
    "velocity fourier parameters can provide additional information on the overtone cepheid pulsation dynamics and , thus , can shed new light on the resonance puzzle .",
    "the radial velocity , being a dynamical quantity , should display the effects of resonances in a more visible way .",
    "the models of bl  her - type stars give a good example of such a behavior ( moskalik & buchler @xcite , buchler & buchler @xcite ) .",
    "the use of the velocity data is also preferred for comparison with the hydrodynamical computations , which are known to reproduce the observed velocity curves very well ( e.g. moskalik et  al .",
    "@xcite ) . as for the light curves ,",

    "@xcite , moskalik & buchler @xcite ) .",

    " these 3 variables have been analyzed by krzyt et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) . for ( @xmath44day ) and ( @xmath45day ) the values of @xmath0 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 fall well below the fundamental mode sequence and close to those of and .",
    "this behavior strongly suggests the s - cepheid classification , but the amplitude of both stars is rather high and typical of fundamental pulsators ( @xmath46  km / s and @xmath47  km / s , respectively ) . in the case of ( @xmath48day ) , the values of @xmath49  km",
    "/ s and @xmath50 point towards the s - cepheid classification , but the very high value of @xmath51 is in conflict with such an interpretation .",
    "although all 3 stars differ from the majority of the fundamental - mode cepheids , at this point the evidence is not sufficient to consider them overtone pulsators .",
    "our sample of 24 s - cepheids covers the range of periods from 1.95 to 7.57day . except for which deviates from the trend , the remaining stars display a remarkably tight progression of @xmath0 , @xmath8 and to a lesser degree of @xmath36 with the pulsation period . as the period increases , @xmath0 rises , reaches a maximum at about @xmath52day and then falls down to @xmath53rad .",
    "this variation is accompanied by a decrease of @xmath8 at periods of @xmath54day , followed by a very slow increase .",
    "the amplitude @xmath36 decreases uniformly throughout the whole range of periods .",
    "in contrast to the low order parameters , the behavior of the higher order terms @xmath35 and @xmath9 shows essentially no features , perhaps because of their low accuracy .",
    "the velocity fourier parameters of the overtone cepheids are distinctively different from those of the fundamental - mode pulsators .",
    "in particular , @xmath36 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are much lower , which is a testimony to the `` sinusoidal '' shape of the s - cepheid velocity curves .",
    "the two groups are also clearly separated in the @xmath55 plane , except a narrow range of periods around 5day .",
    "these properties allow to distinguish overtone from fundamental - mode cepheids in the _ entire _ range of periods , including @xmath40day , where antonello s et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) criterion based on the light curve @xmath0 no longer works .    in fig.[fig : phi21 ] we compare the s - cepheid @xmath0 progression for light curves and for velocity curves .",

    "the two @xmath0 plots are remarkably different . for the light curves , @xmath0 undergoes a dramatic , essentially discontinuous drop at a period of @xmath56day .",
    "it is this behavior , accompanied by a local minimum of @xmath8 , which led to the hypothesis that the 2:1 resonance between the first overtone and the fourth overtone occurs at this place ( antonello & poretti @xcite ; petersen @xcite ) . in case of the velocity curves",
    ", @xmath0 varies smoothly and displays _ no jump at 3.2day _ nor at any other period .",
    "the same is true for all the remaining velocity fourier parameters . in other words",
    ", there is no spectacular change of velocity curve morphology at 3.2day .",
    "this surprising and unexpected result contradicts the assumption of a resonance occurring at this particular period .",
    "the resonance does not have to cause discontinuous variations of the fourier parameters .",
    "when it does , however , it happens for _ both _ the velocity curves and the light curves ( e.g. buchler & kovcs @xcite ) . because for the s - cepheids this is not the case",
    ", we must conclude that the 3.2day feature in their light curves is not related to the resonance .",
    "we will show in the next section that the resonance is nevertheless present in these stars , but its center is located at a very different period .",
    "two extended surveys of nonlinear first overtone cepheid models have been performed in recent years , by schaller & buchler ( @xcite ) and by antonello & aikawa ( @xcite ) .",
    "those surveys have been aimed at investigating the effects of the @xmath57 resonance . in order to study these effects in a systematic fashion",
    ", the models have been grouped in one parameter sequences , running either at constant luminosity ( antonello & aikawa ) or parallel to the theoretical first overtone blue edge ( schaller & buchler ) .",
    "both sets of calculations are performed with purely radiative hydrocodes and almost the same input physics ( e.g. opacity tables ) .",
    "consequently , they both give very similar results . in the following discussion",
    "we will use models of schaller & buchler , primarily because their sequences cover a wider range of period ratios , @xmath58 .    in fig.[fig :",
    "phi21a ] we plot the observational data together with the theoretical values of @xmath0 for two sequences of models . sequence a ( solid line ) obeys the mass - luminosity relation of chiosi ( @xcite ) and runs on the h ",
    "r diagram parallel to , but 100k cooler of the first overtone blue edge .",
    "sequence b ( dashed line ) follows the classical @xmath11 relation of becker et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and is 300k cooler than the blue edge .",
    "the resonance with the fourth overtone occurs in sequences a and b at , respectively , @xmath59day and @xmath60day .",
    "as already discussed , the calculations fail to reproduce the jump of the _ photometric _ @xmath0 .",
    "the variations displayed by the models are never as large or as sharp as actually observed .",
    "the situation is , however , entirely different in case of _ velocity curves_. for both sequences shown , the progression of velocity @xmath0 has a shape remarkably similar to the observed one .",
    "the theoretical curves do not agree with the observations , though  they are displaced either to shorter or to longer periods in respect to the data .",
    "it is easy to notice that the displacement depends on the position of the @xmath4 resonance within the sequence .",
    "thus , a good match between the models and the radial velocity data should be possible , provided that the resonance period in the models is chosen properly .",
    "we now use the radial velocity @xmath0 data to constrain the position of the s - cepheid 2:1 resonance .",
    "fig.[fig : phi21a ] ( bottom ) already shows that it must be located somewhere between 4.02 and 5.40day ( i.e. between values for sequences a and b ) .",
    "we want to pinpoint the resonance center more precisely , though . to that aim we will try to `` construct '' the model sequence that matches the velocity data as closely as possible .    the hydrodynamical computations of schaller & buchler ( @xcite ) show that the velocity @xmath0 for the overtone cepheid models is very tightly correlated with the resonant period ratio , @xmath58 .",
    "in other words , to a very good approximation we can write :    @xmath61    where function @xmath62 is _ the same for every model sequence_. analogous property has also been found for the fundamental - mode cepheids , where the @xmath63 resonance plays an important role ( buchler et  al .",
    "@xcite ) . for _ any _ sequence of models ,",
    "the relation between the period ratio and the period can be described by an approximate formulae    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the period at the resonance center .",
    "the parameters @xmath65 and @xmath66 are different for every sequence .",
    "our goal is to find the values of these parameters , for which a sequence reproduces the observations best . substituting eq.(4 ) into eq.(3 ) we get    @xmath67\\eqno(5)\\ ] ]    @xmath65 and @xmath66 can now be determined by fitting the above expression to the observed values of velocity @xmath0 .",
    "this is done with a @xmath68 method , minimizing    @xmath69 ^ 2\\eqno(6)\\ ] ]    where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the observed and estimated values , respectively , and @xmath72 is the error of the observed @xmath0 . for the function",
    "@xmath73 we adopt the @xmath0 progression of sequence a. it is the longest and most densely sampled of all sequences of schaller & buchler ( @xcite ) . , which deviates from the trend is omitted from the fit .",
    "another star , , turns out to be outside the range of @xmath58 covered by the models .",
    "the minimization leads to an excellent fit with @xmath74 , for @xmath68 of 20 degrees of freedom ( 22 stars , 2 parameters ) .",
    "the low value of @xmath75 shows that eq.(5 ) indeed provides a good representation of physical reality .",
    "the values of the parameters determined from the fitting procedure are @xmath76 and @xmath77day ( @xmath78 errors ) .",
    "the resultant @xmath0 fit is shown in fig.[fig : fig2 ] ( top ) .",
    "the plot confirms that a very good match between the models and the @xmath0 data has been achieved . in the middle and bottom panels of the figure we display the theoretical values of @xmath8 and @xmath36 for the same sequence of models ( solid lines ) . aside from shifting and stretching of the abscissa ( eq.(4 ) ) nothing else has been adjusted here .",
    "the computed amplitude ratio @xmath8 is systematically too high as compared to the data ( and so is @xmath36 ) , but otherwise its progression with period bears a very strong resemblance to the observations .",
    "in particular , _ both _ the models and the data display a steep decrease of @xmath8 between periods of @xmath79 and @xmath80day , followed by a slow increase .",
    "the excessively high values of theoretical @xmath36 and @xmath8 should not be consider a serious problem , in fact they can be easily adjusted .",
    "both quantities depend sensitively on the artificial viscosity , which is a numerical parameter in the hydrodynamical codes . by increasing the artificial viscosity",
    ", we can decrease @xmath8 of all models by a certain constant factor .",
    "this will also decrease the amplitude @xmath36 by a similar ( although somewhat larger ) factor .",
    "the velocity fourier phase @xmath0 , on the other hand , will remain almost _ unchanged _ and the good fit achieved for this parameter will not be spoiled .",
    "this is a very general property of the radiative hydrodynamical models ( e.g. kovcs @xcite ; kovcs & buchler @xcite ; kovcs & kanbur @xcite ) and it holds for the s - cepheid models as well ( schaller & buchler @xcite ) .",
    "the dashed lines in fig.[fig : fig2 ] show theoretical @xmath36 and @xmath8 of sequence a , both divided by the same factor of 1.5 .",
    "the scaled amplitude ratio @xmath8 is in a very good _ quantitative _ agreement with observations .",
    "not only the location , but also the size of the @xmath8 drop is now reproduced .",
    "the scaled amplitude @xmath36 is also much closer to the measured values , although it is still somewhat too high .",
    "fig.[fig : fig2 ] shows that the parameterization given by eq.(4 ) can bring velocity @xmath0 and @xmath8 into remarkably good , _ simultaneous _ agreement with the s - cepheid observations .",
    "this proves that the radiative models are capable of describing the radial velocity variations in these stars .",
    "it also shows that the 2:1 resonance plays a dominant dynamical role in the s - cepheid pulsations . in that respect ,",
    "s - cepheids are very similar to their fundamental mode counterparts . indeed ,",
    "even the shapes of the velocity @xmath0 and @xmath8 progressions are in both groups of stars remarkably alike ( buchler et  al .",
    "@xcite ; their fig.16 ) .",
    "the most important outcome of the fitting procedure is the determination of the s - cepheid resonant period .",
    "we stress , that this result is based _",
    "solely _ on matching the observed and computed @xmath0 .",
    "the derived value is somewhat dependent on the way we define the function @xmath73 .",
    "for example , if it is given by sequence b instead of sequence a , we obtain @xmath81day . this is an extreme case , however . for other sequences of models",
    "we _ always _ find higher values . as our final estimate of the resonant period",
    "we adopt the value resulting from fitting of sequence a. we consider it to be most trustworthy , because this particular sequence covers the widest range of @xmath58 and simultaneously gives the best match to the @xmath0 data ( in terms of @xmath75 ) .",
    "we conclude , that the 2:1 resonance between the first overtone and the fourth overtone occurs in s - cepheids at a period of @xmath82day .",
    "the evolutionary mass - luminosity relation for the classical cepheids is still a matter of considerable debate ( cf .",
    "buchler et  al .",
    "the newly derived position of the @xmath83 resonance can be used to constrain this important relation . in the following ,",

    "( @xcite ) and assume that the @xmath11 relation has the form    @xmath84    the zero point parameter @xmath85 has to be adjusted , so as to place the resonance at the right period . in order to determine the value of @xmath85 , we resort to the linear non - adiabatic ( lna ) pulsation calculations .",
    "we use the linear pulsation code of dziembowski ( 1977 ) , with the latest version of the opal opacities ( iglesias & rogers @xcite ) and assume the standard pop.i metallicity of @xmath86 .",
    "the lna calculations show that the first overtone blue edge and the fundamental blue edge are about 250  k apart . in the region between the two lines",
    "the models can pulsate in the first overtone only .",
    "we assume , somewhat arbitrarily , that the sample of galactic s - cepheids is represented best by the sequence of models running on the h ",
    "r diagram parallel the two blue edges , half - way between them . for a sequence constructed in such a way ,",
    "the resonance condition ( @xmath87 at @xmath88day ) is satisfied for @xmath89 .    the derived value of @xmath85 is not very far from the zero point of @xmath90 , inferred from the fundamental mode 2:1 resonance at @xmath91day ( moskalik & krzyt @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the difference of @xmath92 corresponds to 4.9% difference of mass at a given luminosity .",
    "although not in full agreement , the two values of @xmath85 are close enough that with better models it might be possible to match both resonances with the same @xmath11 relation . for the s - cepheid resonance located at 3.2day , as suggested in earlier literature , a simultaneous match is hardly possible .",
    "such a low value of @xmath65 would require a zero point of @xmath93 , which is incompatible with the fundamental mode constraint .",
    "we have collected new coravel radial velocity data and have then derived the fourier parameters of the pulsation velocity curves for 14 overtone cepheids .",
    "our sample , combined with 10 variables of krzyt et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) , covers the entire range of s - cepheid periods . as such",
    ", it is perfectly suited to discuss the group properties of this class of stars .",
    "the main results of our work can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the progressions of the s - cepheid fourier parameters for velocity curves and for light curves are very different .",
    "velocity parameters vary smoothly with the period and do not undergo any rapid changes or jumps .",
    "the jump of the photometric @xmath0 at @xmath7day is not related to the resonance , but must be caused by some other , as yet unidentified effect .",
    "velocity fourier parameters @xmath0 and @xmath8 can be reproduced remarkably well by the resonant ( radiative ) hydrodynamical models .",
    "this clearly shows that the 2:1 resonance with the fourth overtone is instrumental in shaping the s - cepheid pulsations .",
    "the fit of the models to the velocity data yields a new estimate of the resonance period , which is @xmath94day .",
    "this period implies the @xmath11 relation zero point of @xmath89 , not very different from value inferred from @xmath95 resonance .",
    "3 .   velocity fourier parameters can discriminate between the overtone and the fundamental - mode pulsators at all periods , including @xmath40day .",
    "this property allows identification of two new overtone cepheids : ( @xmath37 day ) and v440  per ( @xmath38day ) . the comparison with the hydrodynamical models ( cf .",
    "fig.[fig : fig2 ] ) supports this identification .",
    "the derived resonant period is based solely on the analysis of the s - cepheid radial velocity curves , in particular of the velocity fourier phase @xmath0 , while the light curve information has been entirely ignored .",
    "there are two arguments in favor of such an approach .",
    "first , the velocity @xmath0 is predicted by the existing hydrocodes more robustly than any fourier parameter of the light curve .",
    "it shows little sensitivity to the the adopted artificial viscosity ( as discussed above ) or to the choice of particular numerical scheme ( e.g. buchler , kollath & marom @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast to the light curve fourier phases , it also shows little sensitivity to the treatment of radiative transfer in the optically thin outer layers of the star ( feuchtinger & dorfi @xcite ) .",
    "this last property is particularly important , since most hydrocodes do a rather poor job in this respect .",
    "when velocity data are available for comparison , the agreement between the models and observations is always very good , much better than ever achieved for the light curves .",
    "this is clearly the case for the fundamental - mode cepheids ( moskalik et  al .",
    "a very good match between computed and observed overtone cepheid velocity curves strengthens our confidence in the above reasoning .",
    "the second argument comes from the fact that the resonant interaction of pulsation modes is a _ dynamical _ phenomenon . since @xmath13 is a _ dynamical _ quantity , studying its variations is , in our opinion , the most direct and perhaps more basic way of probing resonance effects in pulsating stars .",
    "we want to end this paper with a word of caution .",
    "the hydrodynamical models ( schaller & buchler @xcite ; antonello & aikawa @xcite ) which can match the velocity data so successfully , at the same time fail to reproduce the observed light curves . at this point we can offer no explanation for this discrepancy . a new modeling effort with better input physics is needed to address this problem and to confirm our conclusions .",
    "such an effort , based on adaptive mesh hydrocode with time - dependent convection is already underway and its first results are very promising ( buchler , private communication ) .",
