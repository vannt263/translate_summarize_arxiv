    "there are many extra complications and difficulties to be encountered in quantum electrodynamics , but at the low energies relevant to quantum optics the direct connection to the harmonic oscillator is almost all that is required to begin the study of quantum light.@xcite    given that all quantum states of single - mode ( one wave - vector , one polarization ) light are states of the quantum harmonic oscillator , we can expect some important quantum states of light to have been discovered early in the twentieth century , without their significance being fully appreciated at the time .",
    "it is nevertheless impressive that what has become known as the coherent state was identified by schrdinger as early as 1926.@xcite it is also remarkable that a natural generalization of the coherent state to a hierarchy of similar states is rarely discussed in quantum mechanics or quantum optics .",
    "the coherent state has a gaussian probability density whose peak follows the sinusoidal trajectory @xmath0 of the classical particle .",
    "this leads to the description of the coherent state as a  displaced \" ground state since its probability density differs from that of the ground state only through its oscillation in time .",

    "after brief attention in the 1950s , these displaced energy eigenstates were rediscovered in the 1970s.@xcite roy and singh@xcite introduced the designation  generalized coherent states \" ( gcs ) for senitzky s solutions , and their properties in quantum optics were discussed by oliveira _",

    "there have also been a few subsequent rediscoveries of gcs.@xcite so - called  squeezed \" versions of gcs , in which the probability densities pulsate in time as well as following a sinusoidal trajectory , have also been studied.@xcite    interestingly , gcs have also been introduced independently in work on coupled field - matter systems , where they provide a useful set of basis states for some calculations . as our interest here is in the free oscillator , or single optical mode , we refer the reader to some relevant literature and the citations therein.@xcite    gcs are as basic and elementary as the coherent state , yet they receive scant attention in comparison .",
    "they provide a facinating set of quantum states of light that combines features of two stalwarts of quantum - optics courses : number states and coherent states .",
