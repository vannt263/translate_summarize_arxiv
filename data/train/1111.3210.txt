    "the general linear mixed model ( glmm ) takes the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 is an @xmath2 data vector , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are known matrices with dimensions @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively , @xmath7 is an unknown @xmath8 vector of regression coefficients , @xmath9 is a random vector whose elements represent the various levels of the random factors in the model and @xmath10 . the random vectors @xmath11 and @xmath9 are assumed to be independent .",
    "suppose there are @xmath12 random factors in the model .",
    "then @xmath9 and @xmath4 are partitioned accordingly as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is @xmath16 , @xmath17 is @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "then @xmath20 and it is assumed that @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath23 denote the vector of variance components , that is , @xmath24 .",
    "for background on this model , which is sometimes called the _ variance components model _ , see @xcite .",
    "a bayesian version of the glmm can be assembled by specifying a prior distribution for the unknown parameters , @xmath7 and @xmath23 .",
    "a popular choice is the proper ( conditionally ) conjugate prior that takes @xmath7 to be multivariate normal , and takes each of the variance components to be inverted gamma .",
    "one obvious reason for using such a prior is that the resulting posterior has conditional densities with standard forms , and this facilitates the use of the gibbs sampler .    in situations where there is little prior information , the hyperparameters of this proper prior are often set to extreme values as this is thought to yield a `` noninformative '' prior .",
    "unfortunately , these extreme proper priors approximate improper priors that correspond to improper posteriors , and this results in various forms of instability .",
    "this problem has led several authors , including @xcite and @xcite , to discourage the use of such extreme proper priors , and to recommend alternative default priors that are improper , but lead to proper posteriors .",
    "consider , for example , the one - way random effects model given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , the @xmath28 s are i.i.d .",
    "@xmath29 , and the @xmath30 s , which are independent of the @xmath28 s , are i.i.d .",
    "this is an important special case of model ( [ eqglmm ] ) .",
    "( see section  [ secowm ] for a detailed explanation of how the glmm reduces to the one - way model . ) the standard diffuse prior for this model , which is among those recommended by @xcite , has density @xmath32 .",
    "this prior , like many of the improper priors for the glmm that have been suggested and studied in the literature , is called a `` power prior '' because it is a product of terms , each a variance component brought to a ( possibly negative ) power .",
    "of course , like the proper conjugate priors mentioned above , power priors also lead to posteriors whose conditional densities have standard forms .    in this paper , we consider the following parametric family of priors for @xmath33 : @xmath34 i_{\\mathbb{r}^{r+1}_+}\\bigl ( \\sigma^2\\bigr),\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are fixed hyperparameters , and @xmath37 . by taking @xmath38 to be the vector of 0 s",
    ", we can recover the power priors described above . note that @xmath7 does not appear on the right - hand side of ( [ eqbeta ] ) ; that is , we are using a so - called flat prior for @xmath7 .",
    "consequently , even if all the elements of @xmath39 and @xmath38 are strictly positive , so that every variance component gets a proper prior , the overall prior remains improper .",
    "there have been several studies concerning posterior propriety in this context , but it is still not known exactly which values of @xmath39 and @xmath38 yield proper posteriors .",
    "the best known result is due to @xcite , and we state it below so that it can be used in a comparison later in this section .",
    "define @xmath40 and @xmath41 , so that @xmath42 .",
    "let @xmath43 denote the observed value of @xmath1 , and let @xmath44 denote the @xmath45 density evaluated at the vector @xmath46 . by definition ,",
    "the posterior density is proper if @xmath47 where @xmath48 a routine calculation shows that the posterior is improper if @xmath49 .",
    "the following result provides sufficient ( and nearly necessary ) conditions for propriety .",
    "( throughout the paper , the symbol @xmath50 subscripted with a matrix will denote the projection onto the column space of that matrix . )",
    "[ thmpropriety ] assume that @xmath51 , and let @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "if the following four conditions hold , then @xmath54 :    for each @xmath55 , one of the following holds : @xmath56    for each @xmath55 , @xmath57 ;    @xmath58 ;    @xmath59 .",
    "if @xmath60 , then the posterior density is well defined ( i.e. , proper ) and is given by @xmath61 , but it is intractable in the sense that posterior expectations can not be computed in closed form , nor even by classical monte carlo methods .",
    "however , there is a simple two - step gibbs sampler that can be used to approximate the intractable posterior expectations .",
    "this gibbs sampler simulates a markov chain , @xmath62 , that lives on @xmath63 , and has invariant density @xmath64 . if the current state of the chain is @xmath65 , then the next state , @xmath66 , is simulated using the usual two steps .",
    "indeed , we draw @xmath67 from @xmath68 , which is a @xmath69-dimensional multivariate normal density , and then we draw @xmath70 from @xmath71 , which is a product of @xmath72 univariate inverted gamma densities . the exact forms of these conditional densities are given in section  [ secsampler ] .    because the gibbs ",
    "markov chain is harris ergodic ( see section  [ secsampler ] ) , we can use it to construct consistent estimates of intractable posterior expectations . for @xmath73 ,",
    "let @xmath74 denote the set of functions @xmath75 such that @xmath76 if @xmath77 , then the ergodic theorem implies that the average @xmath78 is a strongly consistent estimator of @xmath79 , no matter how the chain is started .",
    "of course , in practice , an estimator is only useful if it is possible to compute an associated ( probabilistic ) bound on the difference between the estimate and the truth .",
    "typically , this bound is based on a standard error .",
    "all available methods of computing a valid asymptotic standard error for @xmath80 are based on the existence of a central limit theorem ( clt ) for @xmath80 [ see , e.g. , @xcite ] . unfortunately , even if @xmath81 for all @xmath73 , harris ergodicity is not enough to guarantee the existence of a clt for @xmath80 [ see , e.g. , roberts and rosenthal ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "the standard method of establishing the existence of clts is to prove that the underlying markov chain converges at a geometric rate .",
    "let @xmath82 denote the borel sets in @xmath83 , and let @xmath84 $ ] denote the @xmath85-step markov transition function of the gibbs ",
    "markov chain .",
    "that is , @xmath86 is the probability that @xmath87 , given that the chain is started at @xmath88 . also , let @xmath89 denote the posterior distribution .",
    "the chain is called geometrically ergodic if there exist a function @xmath90 and a constant @xmath91 such that , for all @xmath92 and all @xmath93 , we have @xmath94 where denotes the total variation norm .",
    "the relationship between geometric convergence and clts is simple : if the chain is geometrically ergodic and latexmath:[$e_\\pi    a clt for @xmath80 .",
    "our main result ( theorem  [ thmmain ] in section  [ secmain ] ) provides conditions under which the gibbs  markov chain is geometrically ergodic .",
    "the conditions of theorem  [ thmmain ] are not easy to interpret , and checking them may require some nontrivial numerical work .",
    "on the other hand , the following corollary to theorem  [ thmmain ] is a slightly weaker result whose conditions are very easy to check and understand .",
    "[ corgeoerg ] assume that @xmath51 .",
    "if the following four conditions hold , then the gibbs ",
    "markov chain is geometrically ergodic .    for each @xmath55 ,",
    "one of the following holds : @xmath56    for each @xmath55 , @xmath96 ;    @xmath97 ;    @xmath59 .    as we explain in section  [ secsampler ] ,",
    "the best result we could possibly hope to obtain is that the gibbs ",
    "markov chain is geometrically ergodic whenever the posterior is proper . with this in mind , note that the conditions of corollary  [ corgeoerg ] are very close to the conditions for propriety given in theorem  [ thmpropriety ] .",
    "in fact , the former imply the latter . to see this ,",
    "assume that ( a ) , ( b@xmath98 ) , ( c@xmath98 ) and ( d ) all hold .",
    "then , obviously , ( b ) holds , and all that remains is to show that ( c ) holds .",
    "this would follow immediately if we could establish that @xmath99 we consider two cases .",
    "first , if @xmath100 , then it follows that @xmath101 , and ( [ eqmm ] ) holds ( since @xmath102 is nonnegative ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath103 , then there is at least one negative @xmath104 , and ( b@xmath98 ) implies that @xmath105 this inequality combined with the fact that @xmath106 yields @xmath107 so ( [ eqmm ] ) holds , and this completes the argument .",
    "the strong similarity between the conditions of corollary  [ corgeoerg ] and those of theorem  [ thmpropriety ] might lead the reader to believe that the proofs of our results rely somehow on theorem  [ thmpropriety ] .",
    "this is not the case , however .",
    "in fact , we do not even assume posterior propriety before embarking on our convergence rate analysis ; see section  [ secmain ] .",
    "the only other existing result on geometric convergence of gibbs samplers for linear mixed models with _ improper _",
    "priors is that of @xcite , who considered ( a slightly reparameterized version of ) the one - way random effects model ( [ eqowm ] ) and priors with @xmath108 . we show in section  [ secowm ] that our theorem  [ thmmain ] ( specialized to the one - way model ) improves upon the result of @xcite in the sense that our sufficient conditions for geometric convergence are weaker .",
    "moreover , it is known in this case exactly which priors lead to proper posteriors ( when @xmath109 ) , and we use this fact to show that our results can be very close to the best possible .",
    "for example , if the standard diffuse prior is used , then the posterior is proper if and only if @xmath110 . on the other hand ,",
    "our results imply that the gibbs ",
    "markov chain is geometrically ergodic as long as @xmath110 , and the total sample size , @xmath111 , is at least @xmath112 .",
    "the extra condition that @xmath113 is extremely weak .",
    "indeed , @xmath109 implies that @xmath114 , so , for fixed @xmath110 , our condition for geometric ergodicity fails only in the single case where @xmath115 .",
    "an analogue of corollary  [ corgeoerg ] for the glmm with _",
    "proper _ priors can be found in @xcite .",
    "in contrast with our results , one of their sufficient conditions for geometric convergence is that @xmath116 , which rarely holds in practice .",
    "overall , the proper and improper cases are similar , in the sense that geometric ergodicity is established via geometric drift conditions in both cases .",
    "however , the drift conditions are quite disparate , and the analysis required in the improper case is substantially more demanding .",
    "finally , we note that the linear models considered by @xcite are substantively different from ours because these authors assume that the variance components are known .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ secsampler ] contains a formal definition of the gibbs  markov chain .",
    "the main convergence result is stated and proven in section  [ secmain ] , and an application involving the two - way random effects model is given in section  [ sectwm ] . in section  [ secowm ] , we consider the one - way random effects model and compare our conditions for geometric convergence with those of @xcite .",
    "finally , section  [ secdiscuss ] concerns an interesting technical issue related to the use of improper priors .",
    "in this section , we formally define the markov chain underlying the gibbs sampler , and state some of its properties .",
    "recall that @xmath117 , @xmath118 and @xmath119 is the potentially improper , unnormalized posterior density defined at ( [ eqpistar ] ) .",
    "suppose that @xmath120 for all @xmath23 outside a set of measure zero in @xmath121 , and that @xmath122 for all @xmath123 outside a set of measure zero in @xmath124 .",
    "these two integrability conditions are necessary , but not sufficient , for posterior propriety .",
    "( keep in mind that it is not known exactly which priors yield proper posteriors . )",
    "when ( [ eqtint ] ) and ( [ eqsint ] ) hold , we can define conditional densities as follows : @xmath125 clearly , when the posterior is proper , these conditionals are the usual ones based on @xmath126 .",
    "when the posterior is improper , they are incompatible conditional densities ; that is , there is no ( proper ) joint density that generates them . in either case",
    ", we can run the gibbs sampler as usual by drawing alternately from the two conditionals .",
    "however , as we explain below , if the posterior is improper , then the resulting markov chain can not be geometrically ergodic . despite this fact",
    ", we do not restrict attention to the cases where the sufficient conditions for propriety in theorem  [ thmpropriety ] are satisfied .",
    "indeed , we hope to close the gap that currently exists between the necessary and sufficient conditions for propriety by finding weaker conditions than those in theorem  [ thmpropriety ] that imply geometric ergodicity ( and hence posterior propriety ) .",
    "we now provide a set of conditions that guarantee that the integrability conditions are satisfied .",
    "define @xmath127 the proof of the following result is straightforward and is left to the reader .",
    "[ propminimal ] the following four conditions are sufficient for ( [ eqtint ] ) and ( [ eqsint ] ) to hold :    @xmath128 ;    @xmath129 ;    @xmath59 ;    @xmath130 .",
    "note that @xmath131 , where @xmath41 and @xmath132 . therefore , if condition ( s3 ) holds , then for all @xmath133 , @xmath134 note also that if @xmath135 , then @xmath136 is strictly positive with probability one under the data generating model .",
    "assume now that ( s1)(s4 ) hold so that the conditional densities are well defined .",
    "routine manipulation of @xmath119 shows that @xmath137 is a multivariate normal density with mean vector @xmath138\\ ] ] and covariance matrix @xmath139,\\ ] ] where @xmath140 and @xmath141 .",
    "things are a bit more complicated for @xmath142 due to the possible existence of a bothersome set of measure zero .",
    "define @xmath143 .",
    "if @xmath144 is empty , then @xmath142 is well defined for every @xmath145 , and it is the following product of @xmath72 inverted gamma densities : @xmath146 where @xmath147 for @xmath148 . on the other hand , if @xmath144 is nonempty , then @xmath149 whenever @xmath150 .",
    "the fact that @xmath142 is not defined when @xmath151 is irrelevant from a simulation standpoint because the probability of observing a @xmath123 in @xmath152 is zero .",
    "however , in order to perform a theoretical analysis , the markov transition density ( mtd ) of the gibbs markov chain must be defined for _ every _ @xmath145 .",
    "obviously , the mtd can be defined arbitrarily on a set of measure zero .",
    "thus , for @xmath153 , we define @xmath142 as in the case where @xmath144 is empty , while if @xmath151 , we define it to be @xmath154 .",
    "note that this definition can also be used when @xmath144 is empty if we simply define @xmath152 to be @xmath155 in that case .",
    "the mtd of the gibbs  markov chain , @xmath156 , is defined as @xmath157 it is easy to see that the chain is @xmath158-irreducible , and that @xmath119 is an invariant density .",
    "it follows that the chain is positive recurrent if and only if the posterior is proper [ @xcite , chapter 10 ] . since a geometrically ergodic chain is necessarily positive recurrent , the gibbs ",
    "markov chain can not be geometrically ergodic when the posterior is improper .",
    "the point here is that conditions implying geometric ergodicity also imply posterior propriety .",
    "the marginal sequences , @xmath159 and @xmath160 , are themselves markov chains ; see , for example , @xcite .",
    "the @xmath23-chain lives on @xmath121 and has mtd given by @xmath161 and invariant density @xmath162 .",
    "similarly , the @xmath123-chain lives on @xmath124 and has mtd @xmath163 and invariant density @xmath164 .",
    "since the two marginal chains are also @xmath158-irreducible , they are positive recurrent if and only if the posterior is proper .",
    "moreover , when the posterior is proper , routine calculations show that all three chains are harris ergodic ; that is , @xmath158-irreducible , aperiodic and positive harris recurrent ; see @xcite for details .",
    "an important fact that we will exploit is that geometric ergodicity is a solidarity property for the three chains @xmath156 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 ; that is , either all three are geometric or none of them is [ @xcite ] . in the next section",
    ", we prove that the gibbs  markov chain converges at a geometric rate by proving that one of the marginal chains does .",
    "in order to state the main result , we need a bit more notation . for @xmath165 , define @xmath166 to be the @xmath167 matrix of 0 s and 1 s such that @xmath168 .",
    "in other words , @xmath166 is the matrix that _ extracts _",
    "@xmath15 from @xmath9 . here is our main result .",

    "it is important to reiterate that , by themselves , ( s1)(s4 ) _ do not _ imply that the posterior density is proper . of course , if conditions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) in theorem  [ thmmain ] hold as well , then the chain is geometric , so the posterior is necessarily proper .    a numerical search could be employed to check the second condition of theorem  [ thmmain ] .",
    "indeed , one could evaluate the left - hand sides of ( [ eqcondition2a ] ) and ( [ eqcondition2b ] ) at all values of @xmath176 on a fine grid in the interval @xmath177 \\cap ( 0,\\tilde{s}/2)$ ] .",
    "the goal , of course , would be to find a single value of @xmath176 at which both ( [ eqcondition2a ] ) and ( [ eqcondition2b ] ) are satisfied .",

    "in other words , our sufficient conditions are weaker than those of t&h , so our result improves upon theirs . moreover , in contrast with the conditions of t&h , our conditions do not directly involve the group sample sizes , @xmath360 .    of course , the best result possible would be that the gibbs ",

    "our decision to work with the @xmath23-chain rather than the @xmath123-chain was based on an important technical difference between the two chains that stems from the fact that @xmath142 is not continuous in @xmath123 for each fixed @xmath23 ( when the set @xmath144 is nonempty ) .",
    "indeed , recall that , for @xmath153 , @xmath366 but for @xmath151 , @xmath367 also , recall that the mtd of the @xmath23-chain is given by @xmath272 since the set @xmath152 has measure zero , the `` arbitrary part '' of @xmath142 washes out of  @xmath273 .",
    "however , the same can not be said for the @xmath123-chain , whose mtd is given by @xmath368 this difference between @xmath273 and @xmath369 comes into play when we attempt to apply certain `` topological '' results from markov chain theory , such as those in chapter 6 of @xcite .",
    "in particular , in our proof that the @xmath23-chain is a feller chain ( which was part of the proof of proposition  [ propgd ] ) , we used the fact that @xmath137 is continuous in @xmath23 for each fixed @xmath123 . since @xmath142 is not continuous , we can not use the same argument to prove that the @xmath123-chain is feller .",
    "in fact , we suspect that the @xmath123-chain is not feller , and if this is true , it means that our method of proof will not work for the @xmath123-chain .",
    "it is possible to circumvent the problem described above by removing the set @xmath152 from the state space of the @xmath123-chain . in this case , we are no longer required to define @xmath142 for @xmath151 , and since @xmath142 is continuous ( for fixed @xmath23 ) on @xmath370 , the feller argument for the @xmath123-chain will go through . on the other hand , the new state space has `` holes '' in it , and this could complicate the search for a drift function that is unbounded off compact sets . for example , consider a toy drift function given by @xmath371 .",
    "this function is clearly unbounded off compact sets when the state space is @xmath372 , but not when the state space is @xmath373 .",
    "the modified drift function @xmath374 is unbounded off compact sets for the `` holey '' state space .",
