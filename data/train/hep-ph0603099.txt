    "proton - nucleus collisions provide a laboratory for studying the interaction of colored partons with an extended colored medium . due to the combined effects of quantum mechanical coherence over extended longitudinal distances , and the qcd evolution of nuclear wave - functions ,",
    "the parton from the projectile can probe both the density of color charges in the medium , and the multi - parton correlations that are intrinsic to high parton density components of the nuclear wave function . at high energies , the typical momentum transfer from partons in the medium to the probe",

    ", we will denote the latter @xmath3 in order to distinguish from that of the nucleus . ] @xmath4 .",
    "this scale , termed the saturation scale , is proportional to the density of partons in the transverse radius of the nucleus , and grows with energy  @xcite .",
    "because the running of the coupling is controlled by this scale , asymptotic freedom tells us that the coupling of the colored partonic probe should be weak and will become weaker at higher energies .",
    "therefore , with some effort , one can hope to learn about the properties of the medium  in the sense that one can compute reliably medium effects on the final state observables that are measured by experiments .",
    "the study of high parton density effects in qcd can be formulated , in weak coupling , as an effective field theory  the color glass condensate ( cgc )  @xcite .",
    "the cgc has been widely applied to study gluon and quark production in proton - nucleus collisions - for a review , see ref .",
    "an attractive feature of the cgc effective theory is that one can quantify what one means by dilute or dense scatterers as a function of energy and mass number  @xcite .",
    "what we mean by proton - nucleus collisions specifically , is a systematic expansion of amplitudes to lowest order in the ratio of the saturation momentum of the proton to the typical transverse momentum exchanged by the proton in the reaction ( @xmath5 ) and all orders in the ratio of the saturation momentum of the nucleus relative to the momentum exchanged by the nucleus ( @xmath6 ) . at very high energies , or in very forward kinematics ( in the fragmentation region of the nucleus )",
    ", the proton saturation scale can be large . in these kinematics , for fixed impact parameter , proton - nucleus collisions will be indistinguishable from nucleus - nucleus collisions .    for gluon production in proton - nucleus collisions ,",

    "distributions for the proton and the nucleus , convolved with the hard scattering matrix element  @xcite . for a dilute projectile , such as a proton ,",
    "the corresponding unintegrated gluon distribution at lowest order is a leading twist quantity which , integrated over @xmath2 , gives the usual leading log collinear gluon distribution .",
    "in contrast , the unintegrated gluon distribution of the dense target , the nucleus , contains all twist contributions and has no analogue in the leading twist collinear factorization formalism .",

    "this observation seems related to the following fact : at threshold , the quark and the antiquark are at rest in the rest frame of the pair . when boosted to the lab frame , they have the same momenta at threshold and are therefore collinear .",
    "a pair made of a collinear quark and antiquark is very similar to an octet gluon .",
    "the correlator of two wilson lines satisfies a sum rule which ensures that the momentum integrated distributions are unchanged even if the momenta are redistributed by re - scattering .",
    "it is therefore plausible that the integrated pair distribution at threshold , in analogy to the gluon distribution , is insensitive to re - scatterings .      in the mv model ,",

    "this departure is a small reduction of the yield compared to binary scaling , and one can fit the dependence of @xmath177 on @xmath175 by a function that behaves like @xmath178 .",
    "another quantity , whose dependence on the nuclear size is of phenomenological interest , is the nuclear modification factor @xmath179 .",
    "it is defined as the ratio between the yield in @xmath180 collisions to the yield in @xmath181 collisions , normalized by the number of binary collisions , @xmath182 indeed , this nuclear modification factor for @xmath180 collisions is essential for establishing a baseline for `` normal nuclear suppression '' when looking for potential quark gluon plasma suppression effects on the yield of @xmath14 s in nucleus - nucleus collisions .    in the left plot of figure [ fig : pair - rpa ] , we display this ratio as a function of @xmath154 , for a given @xmath15 and various fixed invariant masses .",
    "one can see here a behavior which is very similar to what was previously observed for gluon production in @xmath180 collisions ( see @xcite for instance ) : there is a suppression at low @xmath154 and an enhancement at high @xmath154 , relative to perfect scaling with the number of binary collisions .",
    "the plot on the right of figure [ fig : pair - rpa ] shows how the value of the suppression at small momentum changes with varying saturation scale .",
    "we show this for an invariant mass just above the pair production threshold because this is the dominant kinematical domain contributing to the production of bound states ( such as the @xmath14 ) .",
    "we observe that the pair yield , for large @xmath152 , behaves as @xmath183 . up to a logarithm ( due to the small difference between @xmath152 and @xmath175 )",
    ", this corresponds to a scaling like @xmath184 where @xmath185 is the longitudinal size of the nucleus .",
    "this @xmath184 dependence is well known from the _ super - penetration _",
    "@xcite of electron - positron pairs through metallic foils ( often called the  chudakov effect \" ) and was noted previously in the qcd case  @xcite , by looking at the propagation of @xmath65 states through a random distribution of color fields .",

    "such an exponential form assumes successive * independent * collisions , and the decreasing exponential is thus the probability that the @xmath14 has survived after propagating through a length @xmath185 of nuclear matter .",
    "however , for the values of @xmath15 probed at present energies it may be difficult to distinguish between the linear and exponential forms .    to observe how this pattern of suppression for producing @xmath65 pairs translates into the nuclear @xmath14 suppression , we will consider the phenomenological `` color evaporation '' model ( cem ) .",
    "this model assumes that the yield of @xmath14 s is obtained by integrating the yield of @xmath65 pairs over the invariant mass of the pairs , from production threshold of a charm quark pair to the threshold for the production of a pair of @xmath189 mesons , up to an overall constant prefactor .",
    "this can be expressed as @xmath190 if hadronization takes place outside of the nucleus ( a legitimate assumption for @xmath14 production at high energy ) , one can assume that the prefactor @xmath191 is the same for @xmath180 and @xmath181 collisions .",

    "the additional factor of @xmath201 arises from the intermediate @xmath154 region , @xmath202 where there is a deviation from the @xmath156 behavior for masses below the saturation scale .",
    "the yield therefore flattens out and does not grow as fast as @xmath198 anymore .",
    "this implies that the limit of zero quark mass is less singular than it is at leading twist . in the latter case",

    "ideally , one should try to constrain the necessary gluon distributions at large @xmath0 from existing data .",
    "however , for the purposes of the qualitative discussion presented here , we follow an intermediate path : we make a simple ansatz for the gluon distributions that continues the mv initial condition at @xmath224 .    because the numerical evaluation of the pair cross - section is done with eq .",
    "( [ eq : cross - section-1 ] ) , we need only to make such an ansatz for the proton unintegrated gluon distribution @xmath47 and for the 3-point function @xmath225 in the nucleus .",
    "one generally requires , from quark counting rules , that for values of @xmath0 close to unity , all gluon distributions vanish as @xmath226 .",
    "we adopt here a simple ansatz that implements this behavior ; @xmath227 where the denominator @xmath228 ensures the continuity of @xmath225 at @xmath222 .",
    "we make the same ansatz for @xmath47 . because the details of how these gluon distributions vanish when @xmath229 are somewhat arbitrary",
    ", readers should note that results for the cross - section in kinematic regions dominated by large values of @xmath0 ( in one or both of the projectiles ) contain a large systematic uncertainty .",
    "this uncertainty is reduced when the center of mass energy @xmath230 of the collision increases because the values of @xmath218 decrease and the corresponding physics is less sensitive to the initial conditions . to ensure a significant region in the kinematical parameters @xmath231 of the pair where the cross - section is not affected by this arbitrariness",
    ", all numerical calculations presented in the following subsections have been performed for the center of mass energy of the lhc , @xmath232tev . at rhic energies , _ if @xmath233 _ , there is no region in phase - space which is not contaminated by the large @xmath0 behavior of one ( or both ) of the projectiles .",
    "therefore , a realistic description of rhic results in this framework would require a less simplistic ansatz than eq .",
    "( [ eq : large - x - extra ] ) .",
    "alternately , it may very well be the case that mv initial conditions may be applicable in large nuclei at larger values of @xmath106 .",
    "a systematic study is required but is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we shall now use the solution of the bk equation with the extrapolation done in eq .",
    "( [ eq : large - x - extra ] ) , to compute the rapidity dependence of the pair cross - section in eq .  ( [ eq : pair - cross - section ] ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : rapidity ] , we show the rapidity distribution of @xmath234 pairs , for a fixed value of the invariant mass @xmath235  gev , and several values of the transverse momentum of the pair . the fact that the first derivative in @xmath0 of the unintegrated gluon distributions is not preserved by the ansatz   ansatz of the form @xmath236 , where @xmath1 and @xmath237 are constrained to ensure that the unintegrated gluon distribution and its first derivative are continuous at @xmath222 .",
    "this ansatz in turn leads to odd behavior of the unintegrated distributions at large @xmath238 .",
    "] of eq .",
    "( [ eq : large - x - extra ] ) shows up in the cross - section as a discontinuity in the slope in @xmath9 of @xmath239 . on the plots ,",
    "we have indicated the region in @xmath9 affected by this extrapolation by plotting only a solid line in these regions ( their boundaries can be easily determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : x12 - 1 ] ) ) .",
    "the central region in rapidity - unaffected by this extrapolation - shrinks as one increases the transverse momentum of the pair , or its invariant mass .      to study deviations from the scaling with the number of binary collisions",
    ", one can compute the ratio @xmath179 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : rpa - def ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : rpa - bk ] , we display this ratio as a function of @xmath154 for different values of the rapidity ( again the invariant mass is set to @xmath235  gev ) . on the left ,",
    "the cross - section has been computed with the solution of the bk equation with fixed coupling , while on the right the bk equation was solved with a running coupling .",
    "there are small quantitative differences between fixed and running coupling , but the overall qualitative behavior of @xmath179 is unaffected .",
    "as one can see , the only region for which the ratio @xmath179 goes over 1 is at the most negative rapidities . as the rapidity increases above @xmath240 , @xmath179 decreases significantly , and remains below 1 at all @xmath154 s .",
    "an alternative way to view the same information is to display @xmath179 as a function of the rapidity @xmath9 , for fixed values of @xmath154 , as in figure [ fig : rpa - y ] .",
    "( note that for a limited region in @xmath9 , and for fixed @xmath154 , it is proportional to the widely used variable @xmath241 . ) on this plot , one sees a rapid decrease of @xmath179 with @xmath9 . in our computation",
    ", this drop seems to start around @xmath240 .",
    "keep in mind however that the lower rapidity region is plagued by artifacts introduced by the large-@xmath0 extrapolation  the drop may in fact start earlier .",
    "moreover , one sees on this plot that the decrease of @xmath179 with @xmath9 is very rapid at negative @xmath9 , and slows down at positive rapidities .",
    "this is reminiscent of the very fast disappearance of the cronin peak in the study of @xmath179 for gluons via the bk equation @xcite .",
    "one also observes that the pattern of this suppression is almost independent of @xmath154 at small @xmath154 , and that the @xmath154 dependence becomes manifest only above @xmath242gev .",
