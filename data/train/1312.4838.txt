    "electron cyclotron current drive ( eccd ) is used for suppression of neoclassical tearing modes ( ntms ) because they limit the performance of tokamak fusion reactors and may lead to plasma disruptions  @xcite . a theoretical model for the interpretation of current experiments and extrapolation of their results to future fusion reactors",
    "is provided by the generalized rutherford equation  @xcite .",
    "this equation describes the time evolution of the full width @xmath0 of the magnetic island associated with an ntm .",
    "it consists of several terms expressing different stabilizing and destabilizing mechanisms .",
    "the term accounting for the contribution of the eccd to the ntm evolution is denoted as @xmath1 .",
    "it is proportional to the two dimensional integral over the cross section of the island of that fourier component of the ec driven current density that corresponds to the helicity of the island . in the calculation of @xmath1 , the ec power deposition profile and driven current density profile",

    "the driven current density @xmath3 is related to the power deposition @xmath4 through the eccd efficiency @xmath5 , which is generally obtained in the linear regime where the eccd efficiency is power independent .",
    "this neglects any temporal variation as a consequence of rotation of the island through the ec power deposition region as well as possible nonlinearities in the eccd efficiency at high power densities due to modifications of the electron distribution function as a consequence of ec driven quasi - linear velocity space diffusion  @xcite .    in a previous study we analyzed the consequences of removing the averaging over the island rotation period  @xcite",
    "it was shown that for rotation periods of the order of , or longer than the electron collision time , the ec driven current density profile moves through the island with the rotation period .",
    "consequently , also @xmath1 exhibits a significant oscillation with the rotation period .",
    "this study still relied on the assumption of a linear eccd efficiency , which implies that for a constant island width the resultant @xmath1 averaged over one rotation period exactly equals the value that is obtained in case of the rotation averaged current density profile . in that case , the oscillations in @xmath1 lead to significant changes of the stabilizing effect of eccd only when the island width changes significantly during a rotation period .    in the present study",
    "we analyze the assumption of a linear eccd efficiency : under which conditions does the eccd efficiency become nonlinear and what are the consequences of a non - linear eccd efficiency .",
    "it has been shown by harvey et al .",
    "@xcite that non - linear effects appear when the ratio of the absorbed power density over the square of the electron density @xmath6 exceeds a certain threshold : @xmath7/\\left ( n_{e}\\left [ 10^{19}m^{-3 } \\right ] \\right ) ^{2}\\gtrsim 0.5\\ ] ] where we have introduced the non - linearity parameter @xmath8 . in the non - linear regime",
    "the eccd efficiency is shown to become power dependent : at a given plasma radius the eccd efficiency increases above linear values for absorption of the ec power on the low field side of the electron cyclotron resonance layer whereas it decreases and even passes through zero for absorption on the high field side of the resonance . in a tokamak",

    "the figure does show another salient feature however : the phase shift of the @xmath192 oscillation relative to the island rotation is clearly larger than what was observed in  @xcite on the basis of a simplified model for the dynamics of the ec driven current inside a magnetic island .",
    "this stems from the establishment of the fisch - boozer current on a collisional time scale as discussed in the previous section .",
    "apart from this increase in the phase phase shift of the oscillation in @xmath1 , the effects of the island rotation obtained in the present work with the full fokker - planck modeling are consistent with the effects of island rotation as obtained in  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we question to what extent the assumption of a linear eccd efficiency is valid for the case of eccd applied for the stabilization of ntms inside a magnetic island .",
    "it has been shown by harvey et al .",
    "@xcite that non - linear effects appear when the ratio of the absorbed power density over the square of the electron density @xmath6 exceeds a certain threshold as represented by eq .",
    "[ eq : harvey ] .",
    "motivated by that , we calculate the non - linear eccd efficiency through bounce - averaged , quasi - linear fokker - planck calculations in a realistic magnetic geometry including a locked or rotating magnetic island . for this purpose , we use the toray ray tracing code  @xcite in combination with the relax bounce - averaged , quasi - linear fokker - planck code  @xcite . the unperturbed plasma equilibrium is taken in accordance with asdex upgrade discharge nr . @xmath14 which features a 3/2 magnetic island  @xcite .",
    "we obtained the topology in the presence of a magnetic island by superimposing a helical flux perturbation @xmath87 which provides a realistic approximation to the radial dependence of the tearing perturbation as given in  @xcite . in this example",
    "the rays propagate tangential to the flux surfaces in the power deposition region . as a result , the whole power from a single ray is absorbed over a very narrow range of flux surfaces .",
    "these calculations show the possibility of significant non - linear effects on the eccd efficiency , especially , in the case of locked islands or when the magnetic island rotation period is longer than the collisional time scale : because the volume enclosed by the flux surfaces inside the magnetic island in particular around the o - point is small , the local eccd power density becomes very high and exceeds the threshold for nonlinear effects .",
    "the non - linear effects result in an overall reduction of the current drive efficiency for absorption of the ec power on the low field side of the electron cyclotron resonance layer in contrast with earlier claims  @xcite .",
    "this observation is explained by the quasi - linear flattening of the distribution function around the resonant velocities reducing the local absorption , which results in a further penetration of the power to regions in the plasma where the current drive efficiency is lower . as a consequence of the non - linear effects , also",
    "the stabilizing effect of the eccd on the tearing mode will be reduced from the linear expectations .",
    "nonlinear effects result in a global decrease of the eccd efficiency .",
    "we present more detailed conclusions by dividing the results into three different categories .",
    "first we start with finding regarding eccd in the presence of no island , that is in the unperturbed equilibrium .",
    "0.5 truecm    * eccd in the unperturbed magnetic equilibrium *    * the maximum absorbed power density for the injection of a 1 mw ecw beam corresponds to a nonlinearity parameter @xmath135/\\left [ 10^{19}{\\rm m}^{-3 } \\right ] ^2 $ ] .",
    "thus , nonlinear effects are not expected for these conditions in asdex upgrade in the absence of magnetic islands . *",
    "low power absorption and driven current density obtained along the central ray of the full beam ray with both toray and relax show good agreement and therefore , provide a cross code benchmark between toray and relax in the low power , linear regime . *",
    "the threshold for non - linear effects is seen to be @xmath142/\\left [ 10^{19}{\\rm m}^{-3 } \\right ] ^2 $ ] in agreement with ref .",
    "* nonlinear effects result in reduction of the absolute value of the global eccd efficiency ( i.e. the ratio of total driven current over total absorbed power ) .",
    "this reduction is explained by the fact that quasi - linear flattening of the distribution function reduces the absorption coefficient and shifts the peak in the @xmath136 profile to a smaller major radius , closer to the cold ec resonance , where the eccd efficiency is lower .    0.5 truecm    * eccd in the presence of a locked magnetic island *    * the topology of the closed flux surfaces in the presence of islands leads to higher local absorbed power densities of the eccd applied for magnetic island control . * the peak power density and ,",
    "consequently , the likelihood of non - linear effects is strongly dependent on the phase of the island . * in case of deposition around the o - point of the island , the threshold for nonlinear effects is exceeded significantly for an injected power of 1 mw and for the parameters of the asdex upgrade discharge being studied . *",
    "the significance of the non - linear effects is best parameterized by a profile averaged non - linearity parameter given by eq .",
    "[ eq : averageharvey ] .",
    "as a function of this averaged non - linearity parameter , the non - linear eccd efficiency is independent of island size and coincides with the results obtained in the unperturbed equilibrium . *",
    "even at 4  mw the expected non - linear effects in the current drive efficiency do not exceed 10% for the asdex upgrade parameters used in this study .",
    "0.5 truecm    * eccd in the presence of a rotating magnetic island *    * rotation of the island generates an oscillation of the total driven current with the rotation frequency , which however becomes insignificant when the rotation frequency is larger than the collision frequency as is the case with a rotation frequency of 23 khz .",
    "* for both 1 and 4 mw , the average of the total driven current over a rotation period converges to the same value as obtained by taking the phase average of the steady state driven current in the locked island cases .",
    "while for 1mw the time / phase averaged current is almost identical to the extrapolated linear result , the 4 mw case shows a reduction of the total driven current of about @xmath175 . *",
    "the time evolution of the current density shows a direct reduction in the driven current density ( absolute value ) at the beginning of each period that a surface is heated .",
    "this is a consequence of the ohkawa effect which stems from the trapping of current carrying electrons  @xcite .",
    "the main current drive arising from the fisch - boozer effect is delayed by a collision time  @xcite . * the current drive efficiency near the o - point and just outside the separatrices",
    "is considerably lowered when the power is increased from 1 to 4 mw .",
    "especially , for the lower rotation frequency of 3 khz the maximum value of the efficiency attained near the o - point is reduced by @xmath180 in the 4 mw case . * time averaged driven current density profiles for 4  mw power injection shows that significant quasi - linear effects are constrained to narrow regions around the o - point and immediately outside the separatrices .",
    "for the 1  mw injection case , the averaged current density profiles in all cases are approximately identical to scaled low power locked island results .",
    "we add that the non - linear effects may already be relevant at present power levels in case of locked islands whereas there is very little or no effect for present power levels when the island rotates .",
    "the consequences of the non - linear effects on the island evolution are found to be minor both in the case of locked and rotating islands . at the mode rotation frequencies",
    "as observed in the actual experiments ( about 23 khz ) , the nonlinear effects are completely negligible even in the case where the power is increased to 4 mw .",
    "in the case of the asdex upgrade discharge 26827 studied in this paper , the ec waves propagate almost tangentially to the flux surfaces of the unperturbed equilibrium in the region of ec power deposition .",
    "the original algorithm for the quasi - linear diffusion calculation in the relax bounce averaged fokker - planck code was based on the wave parameters in the point where the ray crosses the magnetic surface on which the distribution function is to be evaluated . in the case of a tangent ray",
    "this algorithm breaks down , because all power may in fact be absorbed in between the crossing of two of the discrete surfaces being considered . for this reason",
    "a new algorithm for the calculation of the quasi - linear diffusion operator has been implemented .",

    "<S> due to the smallness of the volumes associated with the flux surfaces around the o - point of a magnetic island , the electron cyclotron power density applied inside the island for the stabilization of neoclassical tearing modes ( ntms ) can exceed the threshold for non - linear effects as derived previously by harvey et al , phys . </S>",

    "<S> we study the non - linear electron cyclotron current drive ( eccd ) efficiency through bounce - averaged , quasi - linear fokker - planck calculations in the magnetic geometry as created by the islands . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations are performed for the parameters of a typical ntm stabilization experiment on asdex upgrade . </S>",
    "<S> a particular feature of these experiments is that the rays of the ec wave beam propagate tangential to the flux surfaces in the power deposition region . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations show significant non - linear effects on the eccd efficiency , when the eccd power is increased from its experimental value of 1 mw to a larger value of 4 mw . </S>",
    "<S> the nonlinear effects are largest in case of locked islands or when the magnetic island rotation period is longer than the collisional time scale . </S>",
    "<S> the non - linear effects result in an overall reduction of the current drive efficiency for this case with absorption of the ec power on the low field side of the electron cyclotron resonance layer . as a consequence of the non - linear effects , also the stabilizing effect of the eccd on the island </S>",
    "<S> is reduced from linear expectations . </S>"
