    "long baseline interferometric detectors of gravitational waves ( gw ) @xcite will be operational in the next years .",
    "the preparation for data analysis with these new instruments has begun since a long time for the compact binary inspirals , the most promising source of gw to date , and for periodic sources as well ( see eg @xcite for a review ) . on the other hand , it is important to develop analysis methods to search for gw bursts for which no accurate models exist .",
    "typical sources of gw bursts are supernovae ( historically the first cosmic sources of gravitational radiation ever considered ) .",
    "simulations of collapses of isolated massive stars to neutron stars ( type ii supernovae ) @xcite suggest small departures from spherical symmetry . as a consequence ,",
    "the power radiated away by gw during the few milliseconds of the collapse remains very low : the typical gw amplitude expected for such a source located at 10 mpc does not exceed @xmath0-@xmath1 .",
    "this seems to give only hope for detecting supernovae events from inside our galaxy , given the expected initial sensitivity of the current projects .",
    "collapses of more massive stars to black holes do nt seem to provide much larger amplitudes of gw @xcite .",
    "one important aspect is that these simulations are unable to predict accurate waveforms for the signals , as a small change in parameters can completely change the shape of the waveform ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "this situation calls for search methods with high efficiency and robustness against waveform variations",
    ".    mergers of compact binaries @xcite can also be considered as burst sources with perhaps good chances of detection .",
    "some recent estimates for the amplitude of gw during the merging of two neutron stars give numbers as high as a few @xmath2 for sources located at 10 mpc @xcite .",
    "the merging of a neutron star and and black hole seems even more efficient with amplitudes near @xmath3 for sources at 10 mpc @xcite .",
    "the predicted amplitudes are just above the noise level of initial interferometric detectors , hence a likely detection .",
    "note also that these two kinds of merging compact binaries are likely to be also strong emitters of gamma - ray bursts and , so studies of coincidences between gw detectors and gamma - ray burst detectors on satellites can be crucial to validate the gw detection @xcite . here again , the details of the waveforms in the merging phase are poorly predicted .",
    "finally , concerning the merging of two black holes , the binary black hole grand challenge alliance @xcite intends to compute numerically the waveforms emitted during black hole collision and coalescence .",
    "recent results suggest that gw amplitudes could also be of the order of a few @xmath2 for a total binary mass around 10 @xmath4 located at 10 mpc @xcite .",
    "sources of gw bursts are then characterised by poor predictions of the emitted waveforms . at best , we only have ideas about bandwidths or typical frequencies of the signals . matched filtering , as used for the detection of inspiralling binaries is clearly ruled out in this case and robust methods for detecting this kind of sources are then required .",
    "some methods have been recently proposed and studied .",
    "the `` power filter '' technique has been introduced by flanagan and hugues @xcite in the context of binary black hole mergers , and developed further by anderson _",
    "the idea here is to monitor the noise power along the time ; it can be shown that this filter is optimal when only signal duration and bandwidth are known @xcite .",
    "a similar idea ( `` norm filter '' ) has been tested independently by arnaud _",
    "@xcite to detect supernova gw signals .",
    "time - frequency methods @xcite should be also pertinent for detecting unmodelled bursts ; because of their computing costs , these methods are more suited to the off - line ( re-)analysis of candidates selected by faster online algorithms . of course , one can hardly distinguish between a real burst gw signal and a transient burst caused by noise ; thus , methods devoted to detect non stationarity in the noise@xcite are then able to detect `` true '' signals as well .",
    "conversely , general filters are sensitive to transient noises as well as to bursts signals .",
    "if selected by on - line triggers , these spurious events can be eliminated if they are coincident with signals detected in auxiliary sensors sensitive to different kinds of environmental noise ( seismic activity , rf pickup , ... ) .",
    "otherwise they can be validated when searching for coincidences between candidates from different gw detectors @xcite .",
    "furthermore , if an event is seen in coincidence by , say the three interferometers of the ligo - virgo network , then it will be possible to reconstruct the characteristics of the emitted gw signal @xcite .",
    "in particular , the reconstruction of the location of the source in the sky will permit to search for further coincidences with other types of detectors ( optical telescopes or gamma - ray satellites for example ) , and thus enhance the confidence level of the detection .",
    "our purpose is to develop and test filters for gw burst detection which are efficient , yet simple and fast enough to be used as on - line triggers@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we propose to study a family of filters based on slope detection algorithms , similar to existing contour detection algorithms used for image processing , applied here to the simpler one - dimensional case .",
    "the basic idea is to detect a non zero slope in the data stream delivered by interferometric detectors . in a first step",
    "the data are whitened by some suitable procedure @xcite , so that we assume that the noise is gaussian and white .",
    "if we fit a finite - length time series containing only noise to a straight line , a null slope and a null offset are obtained . a non vanishing slope",
    "could then indicate the presence of some signal added to the noise . in the following",
    ", we will first study as filters for detecting gw bursts , the two parameters of a linear fit , namely the slope ( slope detector ) and the offset ( offset detector ) .",
    "these two filters are strongly correlated ; it is however possible to decorrelate them , and finally combine them in an unique filter using the complete information .",
    "next , we compute the performance of these filters , following a procedure already described in @xcite , and compare them to filters previously tested @xcite and to the optimal filter taken as reference .",
    "we finally study the efficiency of the filters ( fraction of events detected for a given signal over many different noise realisations ) .",
    "throughout the paper , we assume that the noise is gaussian and white with zero mean .",
    "the standard deviation of the noise is then : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the sampling frequency and @xmath7 is the one sided spectral density of the noise @xcite . for numerical examples ,",
    "we take @xmath8 khz ( virgo sampling rate ) and @xmath9 @xmath10 , which is about the minimum value of the foreseen noise spectral density of the virgo interferometer @xcite ; this choice is correct since the minimum is lying right in the frequency range for expected burst sources of gw .",
    "the fact that we choose a gaussian noise is not essential , but simply convenient for the design of the filters .",
    "deviation from gaussianity will produce for example an excess in the rate of false alarms and it will then be possible to retune the algorithms according to the real noise statistics . in the frequency range of interest , above a few 100 hz ,",
    "the virgo noise sensitivity curve is rather flat , although not exactly white .",
    "the filtering methods presented here and in @xcite require a whitening of the noise @xcite , which is foreseen for the output of the virgo data . in the following , we normalise the noise by its standard deviation , so that we are dealing with a gaussian noise with zero mean and unit standard deviation .",
    "let us divide the data set in sliding time windows with n samplings .",
    "fitting the data @xmath11 to a straight line @xmath12 , we obtain the slope @xmath13 and the offset @xmath14 , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is defined as the arithmetic mean of the @xmath17 in the interval of length @xmath18 . here",
    ", @xmath19 is the @xmath20 sampled time and @xmath21 is the @xmath20 sampled value of the detector output .",
    "the fit transforms the input normalised gaussian noise into gaussian random variables , considered as linear filters , with zero mean and standard deviations @xmath22 and @xmath23 given by :    @xmath24    we can finally compute the signal to noise ratio ( snr ) for each of the two filters , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , noting that the only free parameter for both filters is the length of the analysis window @xmath18 . in practice",
    ", their implementation is very simple and fast thanks to trivial recursive relations between filter outputs for two successive windows .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the maximum snr @xmath27 or @xmath28 with respect to the window size @xmath18 is in general not obtained when the slope @xmath13 or the offset @xmath14 is maximum .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ slope1 ] and [ slope2 ] , where we plot the slopes and snr for a gaussian burst signal @xmath29 with @xmath30 ms and @xmath31 ms ( signal maximum at the centre of the time scale ) . in fig .",
    "[ slope1 ] , the analysis window size is @xmath32 , while in fig .",
    "[ slope2 ] , it is @xmath33 .",
    "the slope computed by the fit procedure is much larger in the first case ( @xmath32 ) than in the second ( @xmath33)(factor about 5 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the snr is higher ( by a factor about 5 in this example ) for the @xmath33 window than for the @xmath32 window .",
    "this is due to the fact that a larger window size allows to average the effect of the noise ; indeed , from eq .",
    "( [ sa ] ) , we see that @xmath22 scales as @xmath34 .",
    "thus , for a gaussian signal of width @xmath35 , the optimal window size is found to be about @xmath36 , as seen in fig .",
    "[ slope3 ] . the same is observed for the offset detector ( to a lesser extent ) and for the derived filters described below .      in case of noise alone ,",
    "the normalised offset and slope detectors @xmath27 and @xmath28 are two highly correlated random variables .",
    "they can be decorrelated by diagonalising the covariance matrix of @xmath27 and @xmath28 : @xmath37 where @xmath38 = cov@xmath39 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath40 are then @xmath41 , corresponding to the eigenvectors @xmath42 .",
    "two new uncorrelated random variables are introduced : @xmath43    @xmath44 are normalised in such a way that they are standard normal variables , if @xmath27 and @xmath28 are standard normal variables .",
    "the computation of the covariance @xmath38 is easy , yielding :    @xmath45    the two new statistics @xmath44 can be used as uncorrelated filters for detecting gw bursts , but can also be easily combined into an unique filter .",
    "the optimal variable retaining the full information contained in the slope and offset filters is : @xmath46 in the absence of signal in the noise , @xmath47 is well approximated by a @xmath48 with 2 degrees of freedom , as a sum of the square of two uncorrelated ( albeit not independent ) normal variables .",
    "the filter based on @xmath47 is called alf ( alternative linear fit filter ) .",
    "again , the only free parameter is the window size @xmath18 . note that alf is not a linear filter , contrary to the slope , offset and @xmath44 filters .",
    "a major problem arises when such filters are implemented , and tested with real ( or simulated ) data . to be optimally efficient and because of the short durations of the signals we are interested in , each filter",
    "is applied every time step ( @xmath49 for virgo ) . as a consequence ,",
    "a same false alarm is likely to appear for different window sizes , if different analysis windows are used in parallel , and for consecutive windows : this is the multi - triggering problem .",
    "the redefinition of an _ event _ solves this problem . for each window size @xmath18 used in the implementation of the filters ,",
    "we note @xmath50 and @xmath51 the time characteristics of each triggered event ( time serie of data points for which snr @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the detection threshold ) .",
    "one has to take into account all the possibilities of overlapping between the different intervals . for instance , @xmath54 $ ] ( for analysis window @xmath55 ) and @xmath56 $ ] ( for analysis window @xmath57 ) will describe the same _ event _ if , e.g , @xmath58 and @xmath59 . each selected event will be a cluster of points , characterised by a starting time and an ending time .",
    "we set a detection threshold by choosing a false alarm rate @xmath60 .",
    "in all the following numerical examples , we consider @xmath61 , corresponding to 72 false alarms per hour for a 20 khz sampling frequency .",
    "this choice results from a compromise between the necessary data reduction after online processing ( which should not exceed a few percent ) and the weakness of the gw signals we are looking for .",
    "for instance , it will be shown in the following that , with such a false alarm rate , optimal filtering of a sample of supernovae signals gives , on average , an upper limit for the distances of detection of the order of the radius of our galaxy , using realistic simulations for the emitted waves .",
    "a large part of these false alarms will be in principle then discarded , when working afterwards in coincidence with other detectors , supposing that the different detectors noises are well uncorrelated .",
    "obviously , this rate should be adjusted in future coincidence experiments by the maximum allowed rate for accidental coincidences .",
    "one could have chosen a false alarm rate so that the mean detection distance obtained by matched filtering of realistic supernovae waveforms corresponds to , e.g , the diameter of the milky way ( @xmath62 ) or the distance of the magellanic clouds ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "in both cases , however , the number of false alarms is too high to be manageable ( hundreds or thousands of false alarms per hour ) .",
    "anyway , the exact choice of the false alarm rate , and the corresponding threshold , is not important in this study , since we concentrate in the following on the _ relative _ performances of the filters ( relative with respect to the optimal filter with the same false alarm rate ) , provided that these performances do not crucially depend on the false alarm rate .",
    "4 shows the evolution of the relative performance of the alf filter averaged over a sample of realistic supernovae signals ( described below ) as a function of the false alarm rate .",
    "this performance shows to be relatively constant for weak false alarm rates , and begins to increase for ( non relevant ) extremely high false alarm rates ( @xmath64 corresponds to several thousands of false alarms per hour ) ; this last feature is due to the redefinition of a event , which gives a larger threshold reduction for large false alarm rates .",
    "the false alarm rate chosen in this paper corresponds to a threshold of about @xmath65 for a normalised gaussian variable ( slope and offset detectors , @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) and to a threshold of about @xmath68 for a two - dimensional @xmath48 ( alf ) .",
    "this supposes of course an implementation with an unique window size ; if several window sizes are to be used in parallel , then the threshold has to increased accordingly to keep the same overall false alarm rate .",
    "the actual false alarm rate is then altered by the redefinition of events that is adopted here .",
    "as an example , for a single - windowed slope detector , the same detection threshold would correspond to false alarm rate @xmath61 if the definition of an event is taken into account , and to a false alarm rate roughly equal to @xmath69 if not .",
    "the real false alarm rate will correspond to the number of streams of data points @xmath70 in which @xmath71 ( @xmath53 is the detection threshold ) . the information provided by clustering can be used in two different ways .",
    "first , for a given false alarm rate @xmath72 ( corresponding to a detection threshold @xmath53 for alf ) , and for a given window size , one can determine the probability p(cluster size @xmath73 @xmath74 ) for a cluster of size larger than @xmath74 to occur . a cluster of size larger than @xmath74",
    "will then be found with a rate @xmath75 .",
    "an integer @xmath76 can be found such that @xmath77 . as a consequence ,",
    "the detection threshold @xmath53 for alf corresponding to @xmath72 will be lowered .",
    "the definition of an event in this case will thus be a cluster of size @xmath73 @xmath76 for which snr @xmath52 .",
    "the results obtained with such a definition are similar to the ones described in the next section .",
    "the distribution of the number of consecutive triggers for a given threshold can be used in another way .",
    "this distribution gives a probability of occurrence @xmath78 of a given number @xmath74 of consecutive triggers for the fixed threshold @xmath53 .",
    "then , each cluster can be labelled with the corresponding probability , and one can put _ priority _ in the treatment of those events .",
    "furthermore , putting a threshold on the quantity @xmath74 can help to remove some of the false alarms . in this case",
    ", one can hope to discard a substantial part of the events , which with great probability are actually false alarms .",
    "of course , the loss of signal this process causes has to be quantified . for high snrs physical signals , using alf , an average loss as high as @xmath79 is observed for a @xmath80 false alarms removal . the price to pay for such",
    "a removal is clearly too high .",
    "in order to benchmark the filters , we use a catalogue of simulated supernova gw signals .",
    "indeed , as we need `` robust '' filters with respect to the details of the waveforms , it seems convenient to average the filters performances over a variety of ( physically sound ) waveforms .      as in @xcite and @xcite , we use as a catalogue the 78 gw signals simulated by zwerger and mller @xcite which are available in @xcite .",
    "these waveforms result from the collapse of massive stars into neutron stars within the assumption of axial symmetry .",
    "each signal corresponds to a particular set of parameters , mainly the initial distribution of angular momentum inside the progenitor star and the rotational energy in the core .",
    "all the signals are computed for a source located at 10 mpc ; we can then re - scale the amplitudes of waveforms in order to locate the source at any distance . in the following ,",
    "we assume that the incoming waveforms are optimally polarised , along the interferometer arms ; this assumption has no consequence on the relative performances of the filters .",
    "the detection distances displayed below have then to be considered as upper limits .",
    "zwerger and mller distinguish three different types of waveforms .",
    "type i signals typically present a first peak ( associated to the bounce ) followed by a ring - down .",
    "type ii signals show a few ( 2 - 3 ) decreasing peaks , with a time lag between the first two of at least 10ms .",
    "type iii signals exhibit no strong peak but fast ( @xmath81 1 khz ) oscillations after the bounce .",
    "as the waveforms in the catalogue are explicitly known , optimal filtering can be used as a benchmark .",
    "the optimal snr @xmath82 for a gw signal @xmath11 ( e.g. any of the 78 signals in the catalogue , located at a distance @xmath83 ) is given by : @xmath84 where we use the relation between the one - sided spectral density of the noise @xmath7 , the sampling frequency @xmath6 and the r.m.s of the noise @xmath85 given by eq .",
    "( [ sigma ] ) . since the noise is whitened in the detection bandwidth , @xmath7 is constant and the parseval s theorem can be used .",
    "the optimal snr @xmath82 is proportional to @xmath86 .",
    "we can rather define a ( mean ) distance of detection as the distance for which the signal is just detected , that occurring when @xmath87 reaches the threshold @xmath53 .",
    "such mean detection distances have to be found by simulations ( because @xmath88 is always larger than @xmath89 ) . with @xmath65",
    ", we obtain a distance of detection , averaged over the @xmath90 signals of the catalogue ( here @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 kpc , where @xmath93 is the optimal distance of detection for the i - th signal of the catalogue .",
    "we note that , with the threshold we have chosen , @xmath94 is of the order of the diameter of our galaxy ; a few signals ( those with large initial rotational energy ) have optimal distances of detection larger than 50 kpc , the distance to the large magellanic cloud .",
    "the largest distance of detection obtained in the sample is about 130 kpc .",
    "let us consider the i - th signal in the zwerger and mller catalogue .",
    "its mean optimal distance of detection , defined above , is @xmath93 .",
    "the mean distance of detection obtained with another filter is @xmath95 ( averaged over noise realisations ) .",
    "we then define the performance of the filter for this signal as @xmath96 .",
    "this relative definition is convenient , because of the different `` strengths '' of the signals in the catalogue .",
    "the global performance @xmath97 of the filter is then defined as the average of the performances for the @xmath90 signals of the catalogue : @xmath98    fig .",
    "[ perfvswindow ] shows the performances of the slope and offset detectors and of alf , as a function of the window size .",
    "the maximal performances are obtained for small window sizes ( between 20 and 40 bins , that is 1 ms and 2 ms ) . the slope detector ( sd )",
    "has a performance greater than @xmath99 for window sizes ( @xmath100 ) up to 100 bins ( 5 ms ) .",
    "the offset detector ( od ) keeps a performance greater than @xmath99 up to @xmath101 ms while the performance of alf is always greater than @xmath99 up to @xmath102 ms .",
    "for all the window sizes studied here , all the filters have performances greater than @xmath103 . for @xmath66 and @xmath67 (",
    "not shown on fig .",
    "[ perfvswindow ] ) , the maximal performances are @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the alf , which combines the informations of the slope and offset detectors , is the most performant for any window size .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]        table 4 : average source distances for which the alf and related filters reach a 95% ( 50% ) efficiency    figure 7 shows the false dismissal rate ( ratio of missed events or _ inefficiency _ ) as a function of the false alarm rate , for signals located at 10 and 25 kpc , for a single windowed alf filter . at @xmath106 , with realistic false alarm rates ( of the order of @xmath107 ) , the dismissal rate is about @xmath108 .",
    "small dismissal rates can be reached with extremely high false alarm rates ( greater than @xmath109 ) .",
    "even if the performances of such a filter seems to be very high , the detection of sources ( from such a catalogue ) out of our galaxy will be clearly difficult .",
    "the last curve ( labelled @xmath110 ) shows the evolution of the false dismissal rate where each signal of the catalogue has been located to a distance at which , for final alf ( 5 windows ) , the detection efficiency is @xmath111 .",
    "this means that in this case , each source is located at the same fraction of its own optimal detection distance ( hence a _ different _ distance for each source ) .",
    "it is likely that the data provided by the interferometric detectors will be non - gaussian and non - white . on - line filters will process pre - whitened data , and this whitening will be certainly non perfect .",
    "this is a crucial point to know how online triggers will behave in such a case . in order to study this effect ,",
    "we thus have added to the white gaussian noise low frequency components of the type @xmath112 .",
    "we then compute , as a function of the frequency @xmath113 , the amplitude @xmath114 which corresponds to an increase of @xmath115 of the number of false alarm , for the final multi - windowing alf filter .    for @xmath116 ( pendulum mode in virgo ) , we find that the maximum authorised amplitude is of the order of @xmath117 . for other frequencies ,",
    "@xmath114 is in the range @xmath118 - @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) up to 1 khz .",
    "9 shows the evolution of the false alarms excess as a function of the amplitude of the @xmath121 component in imperfectly whitened samples of data . a low frequency amplitude about 5 times larger than @xmath114 for @xmath116 gives 10 times more false alarms .",
    "this proves ( if needed ) that the whitening process will be a crucial part of the analysis procedure .",
    "we have designed and tested some filters based on linear fits and aimed at the detection of short bursts of gravitational waves , such as the ones emitted by massive star collapses . in particular , we have built a non linear filter , alf , from the slope and offset detectors resulting from the fit procedure .",
    "these filters match the simplicity and speed requirements needed for on line triggers to be easily implemented in interferometric detectors of gravitational waves .",
    "the performances of the filters are better than those of the filters studied in @xcite with the same procedure . in particular , the alf filter , if implemented with 5 windows , reaches a performance of about @xmath122 , relative to the matched filter , and the detection efficiency for such signals is about @xmath80 at a distance @xmath123 .",
    "this is , however , just enough to detect supernova signals from anywhere in the galaxy .",
    "indeed , the mean distance of detection averaged over the supernova signals contained in the zwerger and mller catalogue is about 22.5 kpc , of the order of the diameter of the galaxy .",
    "this figure has been obtained by assuming an optimal incidence of the ( `` + '' polarised ) signals along the arms of the interferometric detector , and should be in fact corrected for the incidence effect .",
    "averaging over all the possible source locations in the sky reduces the signals by at least @xmath124 ( in the isotropic case ) .",
    "this finally results in a mean distance of detection of about 10 kpc . clearly , with the low expected rate of supernovae in our galaxy ( about 3 per century ) massive star collapses are not likely to be detected with the first generation of interferometric detectors , unless the asymmetry of the collapse is much larger than presently expected in current models .",
    "it is not impossible , however , that the first generation detectors could be sensitive to binary mergers as far as the virgo cluster ( especially black hole mergers ) . indeed ,",
    "rough estimates of the amplitudes of the gw signals are two or three orders of magnitude larger than the ones predicted for the supernova signals ; this gives crudely distances of detection that might be as large as 10 mpc with the present detectors , ligo i and virgo .",
    "regarding the detection of gw emitted by a binary system , combining the traditional method of matched filtering for the inspiral phase and a `` pulse '' detection technique , such as those developed in this paper and in @xcite , could help to increase the final signal to noise ratio and then the confidence in the detection of an interesting event .",
    "this can be valuable especially for binary black holes , for which only a few cycles can span the detector bandwidth , so that the contribution of the merging phase to the total signal to noise ratio can be important ( see @xcite for an idea of the respective strengths of the inspiral and merger waveforms ) .",
    "finally , a filter such as alf seems to fulfil all requirements to be implemented as part as on line trigger dedicated to detect bursts of unknown waveform in interferometric detectors of gravitational waves .",
