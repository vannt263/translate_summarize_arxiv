    "rare - earth ( re ) doped crystals are promising solid state candidates for quantum information processing .",
    "@xcite in particular , they can show extremely narrow optical homogeneous linewidths at low temperature , in the range of a few khz to less than 100 hz.@xcite combined with inhomogeneous linewidths in the ghz range , this allows optical addressing of ions within ensemble for quantum processors , or quantum memories with large time - bandwidth products .",
    "moreover , several re ions have non - zero nuclear spins , which can act as long - lived , optically addressable qubits . @xcite as an example , hyperfine transitions of eu@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 can show coherence lifetimes ( @xmath5 ) up to 6 hours at 2 k [ ] using various dephasing control techniques , and still reach a few ms at 20 k.@xcite recent results include entanglement storage@xcite and light - matter teleportation at the telecom wavelength,@xcite single photon level memories with storage in nuclear spin states,@xcite as well as memories with high efficiency,@xcite and storage time exceeding one minute.@xcite large and switchable interactions between re ions have also been observed,@xcite as well as single re detection,@xcite which opens the way to quantum processing in these systems .",
    "paramagnetic re ions , such as nd@xmath0 or er@xmath0 , have one more degree of freedom due to their electron spins .",
    "this can be used to interface microwave photons to a re doped crystal through a superconducting resonator@xcite and obtain quantum memories for superconducting qubits .",
    "@xcite in this case too , nuclear hyperfine transitions can provide long storage time .",
    "we recently showed that @xmath6nd@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 hyperfine transitions have ground state coherence lifetimes up to 9 ms at 5 k , whereas the electron spin @xmath5 is about 100 @xmath7s.@xcite high fidelity coherent transfer of microwave excitations to nuclear spins was also demonstrated by quantum state tomography .",
    "ultimately , it should be possible to build coherent interfaces between optical and/or microwave photonics qubits , and long lived nuclear spin quantum states .",
    "yb@xmath0 ions have attractive properties in this respect .",
    "their 4f@xmath8 configuration comprises only two multiplets : @xmath9f@xmath10 ( ground ) and @xmath9f@xmath11 ( excited ) separated by @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "this energy corresponds to the near infrared , where laser diodes are easily found .",
    "the excited state decays usually radiatively , with a lifetime of about 1 ms , which sets a limit for the optical coherence lifetime of 2 ms .",
    "there are also two naturally abundant isotopes with non - zero nuclear spin : @xmath3yb@xmath0(@xmath4 ) and @xmath14yb@xmath0(@xmath15 ) , which hyperfine transitions could be used as long lived qubits .",
    "the lower spin angular momenta of yb@xmath0 compared to er@xmath0 and nd@xmath0 ( @xmath16 for all non - zero spin isotopes ) result in simpler energy level structures .",
    "this is important since optical initialization and coherent manipulation of spins require selecting specific transitions within the optical inhomogeneous linewidth by potentially complex optical pumping sequences .",
    "the lower number of spin states in @xmath3yb@xmath0 and @xmath14yb@xmath0 could simplify them considerably .    here",
    "we report on the low temperature and high resolution optical spectroscopy of yb@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 .",
    "this crystalline host has been chosen since it shows outstanding properties in terms of narrow optical linewidths and long coherence spin lifetimes when doped with pr@xmath0 , nd@xmath0,eu@xmath0and er@xmath0.@xcite it is currently the most used host in quantum storage experiments .",
    "we measured inhomogeneous linewidths , absorption spectra , excited state lifetimes and branching ratios for the two yb@xmath0 sites and found values among the best for re doped crystals . magnetic fields are often used to slow down electron spin relaxation,@xcite which influences optical and spin coherence lifetimes and spectral hole burning efficiency . as a first step towards these dynamical experiments , we determined the ground and excited state @xmath17 tensors from electron paramagnetic resonance and optical spectroscopy .",
    "ground state hyperfine tensors were also found for @xmath3yb@xmath0 and @xmath14yb@xmath0 , giving hyperfine structures extrapolated at low magnetic field of a few ghz , suitable for coupling to superconducting resonators .",
    "overall , these results suggest that yb@xmath0:y@xmath1sio@xmath2 is suitable to build coherent interfaces with optical and microwave photons , while offering nuclear spin transitions for long lived quantum states .",
    "we used y@xmath1sio@xmath2 ( yso ) samples doped at 0.005 at.% ( 50 ppm ) with @xmath18 and cut from a boule grown by the czochralski method .",
