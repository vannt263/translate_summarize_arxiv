    "the soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite has been widely used to describe high - energy processes which include energetic light particles .",

    "the effective theory contains a rich class of symmetries , and these symmetries of scet provide us with new insight into factorization theorems @xcite and enable us to perform a systematic power counting in hadronic processes @xcite .",
    "scet has been applied successfully to many high energy processes such as exclusive @xmath3 decays @xcite , inclusive @xmath3 decays  @xcite , quarkonium production and decay  @xcite , deep inelastic scattering  @xcite , and jet physics  @xcite .    in scet , the momentum of a light energetic particle has three distinct scales and can be written as @xmath5 here @xmath6 and @xmath7 are light - cone vectors satisfying @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a small parameter . in many processes ,",

    "if there are contributions at intermediate scales of order @xmath17 , we employ the two - step matching in which @xmath14 is obtained from the full theory by integrating out the hard modes of order @xmath18 , and @xmath16 is obtained by successively integrating out hard - collinear modes of order @xmath19 @xcite .    at leading order in scet ,",
    "the collinear quarks are regarded as massless . because the mass of a light quark , @xmath20 , is very small compared to the hard scale @xmath4 or the intermediate hard - collinear scale @xmath21 ,",

    "any operators including the light quark mass are formally suppressed by @xmath11 or more compared to the leading contribution .",

    "@xmath22 breaking effects can be of this type since the strange quark mass can be numerically regarded as of order @xmath12 ( it is not possible to treat isospin breaking effects in this way since the masses of the up and down quarks are too small to be regarded as of order @xmath12 ) .",
    "another remarkable point about the quark mass is that it can give an enhanced contribution to some hadronic processes in @xmath16 due to the different power counting schemes in @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "although they do not appear at leading order in @xmath14 , since the quark mass terms are suppressed by @xmath11 , light quark masses can give significant corrections to the matching process related to hard - collinear degrees of freedom .",

    "ii , the scet lagrangian with the light quark mass is constructed .",
    "we find an extended reparameterization transformation under which the lagrangian is invariant , and we divide the lagrangian into two reparameterization - invariant combinations . in this procedure",
    ", we show that the original reparameterization invariance symmetry without a quark mass can be extended by modifying the transformation of the collinear quark .",
    "we describe the consequence of the extended reparameterization invariance on the renormalization behavior of the mass operators . in section iii ,",
    "the wilson coefficients of the effective operators including the quark mass are obtained to first order in @xmath29 from the matching between full qcd and scet .",
    "also their renormalization behavior is presented with the effective theory quark mass renormalization at one loop . in section iv ,",

    "the quark mass can be included in the scet lagrangian systematically by integrating out hard degrees of freedom .",
    "we can find an extended reparameterization invariance including the quark mass , in which we modify only the reparameterization transformation of the spinor for the transformation of type - ii . as a result",
    ", the scet lagrangian can be separated into two reparameterization - invariant combinations .",
    "the subleading operators in each combination are related to the leading operators in that combination by the reparameterization invariance , and they have the same wilson coefficients as those of the leading operators . in particular , we find that the mass operators in the scet lagrangian have trivial wilson coefficients and are not renormalized .",
    "these results are explicitly confirmed by the calculation of the corrections to the mass operators in scet to one loop .",
    "the extended reparameterization invariance also constrains some of the wilson coefficients for the heavy - to - light current operators with the quark mass .",
    "it plays an important role in the matching process of the subleading heavy - to - light currents and the higher - order calculations of the time - ordered products of the mass operators .",
    "when we consider @xmath326 in the endpoint region , treating the strange quark mass to be of order @xmath12 , the subleading contribution is of order @xmath28 .",
    "we have verified this by matching the heavy - to - light current onto @xmath258 with the mass operators .",
    "many of the currents with the mass are related to the leading - order currents by the extended reparameterization symmetry .",
    "there are also subleading operators which are independent of the leading current , and these are obtained at higher orders in @xmath29 .",
    "there are no contributions with odd powers of @xmath20 to the decay rate because of spin conservation .",
    "the subleading contributions of order @xmath338 come from the time - ordered products of the double spin - flipped currents with the leading heavy - to - light currents , and the double spin - flipped currents are obtained by the time - ordered products of the leading currents with the mass operators in the scet lagrangian .",
    "the mass correction to the forward scattering amplitude is given by the factorized form which is expressed as a convolution of the @xmath281 suppressed jet function and the leading shape function of the @xmath3 meson .",
    "the jet functions which are obtained from the matching between @xmath258 and @xmath127 can be always expanded by @xmath281 , and can be computed perturbatively in @xmath29 .    in some @xmath3 decays , the subleading effects can be important to extract the ckm matrix elements .",
    "we have shown that the strange quark mass corrections give nonnegligible contributions of order @xmath28 in @xmath1 , and it would be interesting to see if the mass corrections can give significant contribution to other @xmath3 decays . the results in this paper can be a basis on how to explain the @xmath22 flavor - symmetry breaking effects , as in @xmath339 and @xmath340 , in which the mass effects could be a leading result .",
