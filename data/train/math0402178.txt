    "in this section we derive the weight coefficients for the one - sided approximation of the first derivative and then we analyze the spectral characteristics of the weight coefficients sequence .",

    "it follows that the determinant of the system of equations is not equal to zero , i.e. the system of equations has the single solution .",
    "the most simple expression for @xmath84 is obtained in the case of @xmath85 that corresponds to the calculation of the first - order derivative @xmath86 from eq .   as well as taking into account eqs .",
    "and we get the expression for the coefficients @xmath87 @xmath88 where @xmath89 are the binomial coefficients .",
    "it is remarkable to note that the coefficient @xmath90 . to simplify numerical calculations ( especially the analysis of the spectra of the derived sequences ) eq .",
    "should be rewritten in the form @xmath91 where @xmath92    in order to find the coefficient @xmath93 we use eq .   rather than compute the determinant .",
