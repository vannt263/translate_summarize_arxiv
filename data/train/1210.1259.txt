    "to make a certain system consistent , @xcite suggested ( pp .  469 - 470 ) weakening the rule of necessitation to only range over arithmetical formulas . since then , others have suggested various other weakenings of necessitation to make other systems consistent .",

    "the idea is that a global axiom is one which is thoroughly trusted by the agent whose knowledge ( or belief or ... ) is represented by @xmath1 , whereas a local axiom is true , but may not be known by the agent , or may be known with low conviction .    formally , if a system @xmath5 consists of a set of global axioms , a set of local axioms , and the rule of global necessitation for @xmath1 ( and modus ponens , which we hereafter implicitly include in every system ) , we say @xmath6 if there is a sequence @xmath7 such that @xmath8 is @xmath9 and such that for every @xmath10 ,    1 .",

    "the idea for this weakened necessitation appeared in @xcite ( p.  94 ) and more recently it was used by @xcite . in both cases",
    "it was simply called the rule of necessitation ; we have called it the rule of global necessitation so as to distinguish it from its stronger ancestor .",

    "imagine we did not know lb s theorem .",
    "one way we might find it is as follows . in theorem  [ predicates4 ] we proved consistency of a weak predicate form of @xmath0 , by constructing a specific model . to probe for things that can be consistently added to the system , rather than consider the class of all models of the system ( which is very hard to get our hands on )",
    ", we now have a particular model . any schema which holds in the particular model",
    "must necessarily be consistent with the system , _ locally _ ; whether or not it is consistent _ globally _ is another matter , which requires special attention .",
    "one property we might notice about the particular model is that it satisfies lb s theorem . by asking , ``",
    "can this newfound consistent local axiom be made global , '' we might discover lb s schema .    more generally , any time we resolve a paradox by the methods of this paper , building a particular model",
    ", we can look for new consistent local axioms by simply examining that particular model ; we can then attempt to prove ( or disprove ) they are consistent globally .",
    "for example , as seen at the end of section 4 , this kind of reasoning lead us to a new variation of the church - fitch argument .",
    "if we find a new globally consistent axiom in this way , it might be a candidate to answer gr s and van benthem s question . if that axiom somehow explains why a stronger system is inconsistent , even better .    here",
    "are two concrete candidates to answer the question .",
    "first , the schema @xmath144 from section 3 .",
    "this author initially resolved the surprise examination paradox by localizing both @xmath133 and @xmath136 , but this was unsatisfactory ; but the schema @xmath334 , true in the particular model , could be globalized .",
    "the resulting system was a `` consistent subsystem of the conflicting schemata '' , and the new schema `` provides us with positive information '' about it .",
    "likewise the author initially found the schema @xmath185 of section 4 by looking at a specific model witnessing a consistent subsystem of fitch s hypotheses , and @xmath185 could be argued to provide positive information about that as well .    along these same lines , by considering the particular model constructed in section 5 , we might notice it satisfies ( @xmath233 the lone free variable in @xmath9 ) @xmath335 and it s not hard to show this schema can consistently be added to theorem  [ thereisamachine ] as a global axiom .",
    "this schema ( and knowledge thereof ) is called an _ epistemic church s thesis _ in @xcite .",
    "we have shown that certain paradoxes vanish , and certain impossibilities become possible , by localizing certain axioms .",
    "this should not come as too much of a surprise .",
    "one might justify necessitation by saying that if we can prove @xmath9 , then the knower himself can follow that proof , and therefore knows @xmath9 .",
    "but for the knower to follow , the proof must only use axioms the knower is aware of .",
    "this became very clear in section 2 , where paradox occurred despite myhill s weakening of necessitation : we know by second - order logic that goodstein s theorem is true in @xmath52 , but when we don our first - order peano arithmetist hats , that knowledge lacks conviction . merely adding the troublesome axiom would be harmless ( as it is true ) , but its presence invalidates the justification for the rule of necessitation .",
    "in most of our examples , we localized soundness , @xmath133 .",
    "the fact that this resolved all those paradoxes gives evidence , in our opinion , that we should take greater care before assuming @xmath336 .",
    "for further evidence , consider the paradox of the knower of @xcite ( as described in @xcite or on p.  21 of @xcite ) where @xmath337 is one of just three schemas ( plus arithmetic ) which lead to paradox , the other two schemas being practically unassailable . and if that is not already a devastating blow against requiring @xmath336 , @xcite proves that the following system proves @xmath22 for every @xmath9 ( see p.  23 of @xcite ) :        see @xcite for several arguments represents belief rather than knowledge .",
    "] for the philosophical plausibility of knowledge which fails @xmath336 .",
    "i became even further convinced of this when i read , in @xcite , about remarks gdel made at the gibbs lecture ( @xcite ) .",
    "the main objection ( i think ) to admitting the possibility of @xmath340 is that truthfulness is built into the very definition of knowledge .",
    "but in his lecture , gdel distinguished between objective knowledge and subjective knowledge , so that , for example , mathematicians might subjectively come to know that mathematics is sound , through some argument strictly outside mathematics itself an empirical argument , say .",
    "thus the mathematician might understand , subjectively , that @xmath133 holds for her knowledge , while rejecting @xmath336 ( say , upon considering the second incompleteness theorem ) , not because of doubting the _ truth _ of @xmath133 , but rather because of doubting the _ mathematical provability _ of it .",
    "section 5 is particularly relevant : epistemological traditions should assume a back seat when in conflict with practical applications . a truthful knowing machine which knows its own code could be useful in the real world , even without knowing its own truthfulness .",
    "we could , perhaps , sidestep the issue by calling such a machine a `` believing machine '' rather than a `` knowing machine '' , but this would be disingenuous , because we know the machine is truthful ; to call it a believing machine would be to suggest it might be capable of asserting falsities .    * further work . * one obvious direction to take from here is to expand the list of paradoxes treated by global necessitation .",

    "260261 of @xcite .",
    "this paradox can be formally treated with the methods of the current paper , but as there are no _",
    "agents _ involved in it , philosophical justification will require careful treatment in a future paper",

    "( compare the work of @xcite on axioms about self - referential truth . ) for example , by merging ideas from the proofs of theorems  [ surpriseexamthm ] and [ fitch1 ] , it is possible to show that if @xmath143 then the following system is consistent and does not prove @xmath341 , in a language containing operators @xmath1 , @xmath174 , and atoms @xmath131 , thus `` simultaneously resolving '' fitch s and the surprise examination paradox :    1 .",
