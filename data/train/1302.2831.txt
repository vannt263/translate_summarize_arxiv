    "thus every simplex in the cycle has all the same elements of @xmath780 , so @xmath781 that is the greatest such element in every simplex .",
    "hence @xmath782 for all @xmath757 , and @xmath783 for all @xmath96 .",
    "this is a contradiction because the same element is being added and deleted in consecutive steps .",
    "therefore , we have a morse matching whose critical simplices are exactly the elements of @xmath765 , a subcomplex of @xmath169 .",
    "thus , @xmath169 @xmath8collapses to @xmath765 .",
    "the collapsing will occur in three steps .",
    "define @xmath784 @xmath785 first , we collapse @xmath172 to @xmath786 .",
    "let @xmath148 be a chain of the form @xmath787 in @xmath172 where @xmath788 .",
    "if @xmath789 , we want to pair @xmath148 with another chain for which that is also true .",
    "find the last @xmath744 such that @xmath790 . then compare @xmath791 and @xmath792 to @xmath793 and @xmath794 . if @xmath795 and @xmath796 , pair @xmath148 with the chain obtained by adding to ( or deleting from ) the end of @xmath148 the element @xmath797",
    "otherwise , find the first @xmath798 where @xmath799 or @xmath800 . now",
    "pair @xmath148 with the chain obtained by inserting ( or removing if it equals @xmath801 ) @xmath802 before @xmath803 .",
    "nowhere are we inserting or deleting elements with @xmath804 , so the selection of @xmath744 is not affected . in the second case , we are inserting or deleting an element with @xmath805 and @xmath806 , so the selection of @xmath749 is not affected .",
    "therefore , the matching is well - defined .",
    "the critical simplices are exactly those where @xmath807 , forming @xmath786 , a subcomplex . therefore ,",
    "if there are no cycles , we have a collapsing from @xmath172 to @xmath786 . also , the pairings are chosen equivariantly , so we will have a @xmath8collapse .",
    "suppose we have a cycle @xmath753 again , for @xmath754 , @xmath296 is obtained from @xmath755 by deleting an element @xmath808 , so there must be a pair @xmath809 coming from our matching .",
    "therefore , @xmath810 for all @xmath96 , which means that all the simplices in our cycle have all of the same elements with @xmath129 .",
    "thus , they all have the same @xmath811 , so @xmath791 and @xmath792 are fixed and we know that every @xmath808 has them as its second column . as a result , the elements after @xmath811 that have @xmath812 or @xmath813 are not changing as we move through the cycle , implying that @xmath808 is the same for all @xmath96 .",
    "this is a contradiction , so our matching has no cycles .",
    "this proves that @xmath172 @xmath8collapses to @xmath786 .",
    "the next two collapsings are proved by lemma [ main3 ] .",
    "for the first , we define @xmath814 by @xmath815 .",
    "this is an order - preserving @xmath8poset map , and @xmath816 .",
    "the fixed point set of @xmath817 is exactly @xmath43 , so lemma [ main3 ] implies that @xmath786 @xmath8collapses to @xmath818 . for the second collapsing",
    ", we now define @xmath819 by @xmath820 .",
    "this is an order - preserving @xmath8poset map , @xmath821 , and the fixed point set is @xmath681 .",
    "therefore , the same lemma implies that @xmath822 @xmath8collapses to @xmath682 .",
    "hence , @xmath172 @xmath8collapses to @xmath682 .",
    "@xmath8 acts freely outside of @xmath686 , so @xmath823 is @xmath8bicollarable in @xmath824 .",
    "now the theorem follows immediately from [ reg16 ] ( the collapsing criterion for @xmath8regular neighborhoods ) and propositions [ main1 ] and [ main4 ] .",
    "the regular cell complex @xmath105 is a pl manifold with boundary @xmath104 and is equivariantly homeomorphic ( with respect to the involution described above ) to @xmath139 , where the involution on @xmath140 interchanges @xmath141 with @xmath142 .",
    "the stiefel manifold @xmath143 is therefore equivariantly homeomorphic to @xmath104 , which is equivariantly homeomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "it follows from [ gcellcx ] that we have @xmath825 with the subcomplex @xmath826 . because @xmath685 and @xmath140 are both @xmath8regular neighborhoods of the diagonal , they are equivariantly homeomorphic by [ reg4 ] .",
    "the stiefel manifold @xmath5 has a natural action of the orthogonal group @xmath83 ( with the grassmannian as the quotient ) .",
    "the equivariant homeomorphism above is with respect to a single reflection of @xmath83 .",
    "the multimorphism complex @xmath0 does not have a combinatorial @xmath83 action ; however , there is the induced action of the dihedral group @xmath827 ( a subgroup of @xmath83 ) which is the group of symmetries of the cycle @xmath2 .",
    "it seems natural to ask :      unfortunately , neither of the smaller models @xmath104 or @xmath828 is @xmath827invariant , so it seems that one needs to work with @xmath0 which does not have an obvious @xmath827equivariant embedding into @xmath674 .",
