    "thin shells of matter play an important role in many fields of gravitational physics .",
    "they are used as building blocks in a wide range of cosmological models @xcite-@xcite and provide a convenient laboratory for testing properties of interaction between gravitation and matter .",
    "recently , shells of light - like matter have been used to construct a toy model of quantum gravity @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the quantum version of the gravitational collapse has been analyzed in this way .",
    "most of these models possess either spherical or cylindrical symmetry , which enables us to analytically solve the dynamical equations of the system . in the quantum version of the theory ,",
    "the spherical symmetry ensures the existence of a well defined `` position '' ( configuration ) operator which leads to a simple description of asymptotic states @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the complete `` quantization '' of these gravitational toy models can not be obtained unless we are able to decipher the underlying canonical structure of the corresponding phase space and to find the hamiltonian function generating its dynamics as a function of appropriately chosen canonical variables .",
    "such a reduction of the theory  an elimination of gauge degrees of freedom and a formulation of the dynamics in terms of the `` true degrees of freedom ''  was proposed e.g. by j.a .",
    "wheeler and b. dewitt .",
    "the research on a thin matter shell was started by werner israel . in his seminal papers @xcite he considered the dynamics of a self - gravitating shell of matter with the aim to find a simple model of gravitational collapse .",
    "the dynamics of such an object reduces to a proper tailoring of the two different spacetimes ( so called israel s junction conditions ) , describing the two sides of the shell .",
    "the classical equations of motion of a shell carrying self - gravitating light - like matter were derived by barrabs and israel twenty years later @xcite .    however , in many investigations  like creating a toy model for quantum gravity  a variation principle or a proper hamiltonian is needed .",
    "many approaches to this problem consisted in guessing a hamiltonian or a super - hamiltonian of the system from its equations of motion ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "precisely , in @xcite berezin _ et .",
    "al . _ studied a quantum black hole modeled by a thin shell of dust matter . in this paper the equations of motion for such a shell were calculated from israel s junction condition and the hamiltonian of the system was simply set to the derived total mass ( energy ) of the system . in @xcite hjek investigated the quantum gravitational collapse in a simple case of a spherically symmetric thin shell of dust matter with a fixed rest mass , interacting with its own gravitational field . here",
    "the hamiltonian of the system was just guessed in a form that reproduced the equations of motion for the shell .",
    "nonetheless , equations of motion do not uniquely determine an action or a hamiltonian they are generated by ( the so called inverse problem of variational principle ) . some attempts to derive a hamiltonian structure in a spherically symmetric case",
    "were made ( @xcite ) , yet they based on an intermediate variational principle . kraus and wilczek @xcite studied the back reaction in the hawking effect , i.e. the self - gravitational interaction of the radiation and its interaction with the hole . for this purpose a complete dynamical description of a self - gravitating particle was needed , which was implied by a hamiltonian derived from a variational principle guessed for a spherically symmetric system of dust shell and its gravitational field .",
    "friedman , louko _ et .",
    "_ analyzed the hamiltonian dynamics of a massive @xcite and a null @xcite spherical dust shell .",
    "their hamiltonian was , similarly as in @xcite , obtained from a postulated variational principle . in a massive case ,",
    "with the interior mass fixed , friedman and louko s hamiltonian reduces to the one found by kraus and wilczek in the limit of a massless shell .",
    "unfortunately the results were very complicated and gauge dependent hamiltonians  functions of non local momenta  were not useful to serve as a framework for quantization .",
    "the turn in research on deriving dynamics of thin matter shells was made by hjek ( @xcite , @xcite ) who looked for a simple `` toy model '' for quantum gravity and quantum collapse . in @xcite the dynamics of the spherically symmetric shell",
    "is obtained from a super - hamiltonian on which a set of conditions was imposed .",
    "the work @xcite by hjek and one of us ( j.k . ) contains derivation of both the super hamiltonian and the symplectic structure for discontinuous fluid .",
    "it was obtained from the einstein - hilbert variational principle for ideal fluid , without assuming any additional symmetries .",
    "we have done a considerable simplification of this theory by applying the theory of distributions ( in @xcite for a lightlike shell and @xcite for a massive shell ) .",
    "the work @xcite on the dynamics of a self - gravitating null shell of matter is the first one using fully gauge - invariant , intrinsic geometric objects encoding physical properties of both the shell and the light - like matter living on the shell .",
    "moreover , null matter was treated in a fully dynamical ( and not phenomenological ) way .",
    "all its properties were encoded in a matter lagrangian , without assuming any of its additional properties ( like being dust or ideal fluid ) . in the present paper",
    "we apply these results to the case of a spherically symmetric shell of null matter .",
    "the results obtained here provide a successful implementation of the programme started by wheeler and dewitt , continued by hjek , and can be used as a simple `` toy model '' for quantum gravity .",
    "in general , a matter shell may be considered as a singularity of space - time geometry arising when two different , smooth four - geometries are tailored together along a 3-dimensional hypersurface @xmath0 . in this paper",
    "we consider the case when @xmath0 is a null ( `` light - like '' ) surface . here , `` tailoring '' means that the ( properly understood ) internal three - geometries of @xmath0 , induced from each of the two four - geometries , do coincide ( @xcite ) .",
    "the four - dimensional connection coefficients @xmath1 may , however , be discontinuous across @xmath0 .",
    "the curvature tensor density of such spacetime contains derivatives of those discontinuities and , whence , is singular .",
    "such singularity may be nicely described in the sense of distributions as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the dirac delta distribution concentrated on @xmath0 and @xmath4 is a smooth tensor - density field living on @xmath0 .",
    "contrary to the time - like shell , where the tensor - density @xmath4 may be decomposed into a product of the 3-volume element on @xmath0 and the tensor @xmath5 , here such a decomposition is meaningless because of the degeneracy of the 3-metric .",
    "hence , the `` energy - momentum tensor '' @xmath6 can not be defined .",
    "nevertheless , we have shown in @xcite how to construct the `` energy - momentum tensor - density '' @xmath7 in a nice , geometric way . using this quantity ,",
    "the dynamics of the composed  null - matter - shell + gravity \" system was derived from first principles , in both the hamiltonian and the lagrangian approach , and for general null matter",
    ".    for this purpose an appropriate lagrangian @xmath8 was used , where @xmath9 . here",
    "@xmath10 is the 4-dimensional curvature scalar , @xmath11 denotes its regular part and @xmath12 is its singular part .",
    "assuming the spherical symmetry of the shell , we obtain a simple hamiltonian system in this way . in the case of a massive shell",
    "its complete description was given in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here , we are going to present similar results for the case of a null shell .",
    "similarly as was done in @xcite , a spherical symmetry condition is imposed at the hamiltonian level only .",
    "( on the other hand , one could also impose this symmetry already at the level of variational ( lagrangian ) formulation , as was done in @xcite . ) as a result , we obtain the hamiltonian dynamics of the system described in terms of gauge - independent variables and their conjugate momenta .",
    "the fundamental difference between the null and the massive case consists in the fact , that there are no massive shells without matter . on the other hand , gravitational `` shock waves '' , i.e. null shells without any matter",
    ", are perfectly allowed by the theory .",
    "nevertheless , our theory admits also null - like matter , which couples consistently to gravity .",
    "we have analyzed several models of such matter . in most cases it couples to an isolated horizon only , which is rather a trivial case .",
    "however , other interesting and self - consistent models have been found ( see [ lagrangians ] ) .",
    "they lead to non trivial dynamical systems .",
    "the space of initial data of the `` matter + gravity '' system can be parameterized by the following space of functions : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a three - dimensional metric on a spacelike cauchy surface @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are appropriate adm ( @xcite ) momenta describing external curvature of this surface .",
    "moreover , @xmath17 describe configuration variables of the matter and @xmath18 describe their conjugate momenta .",
    "we limit ourselves to the topologically trivial case @xmath19 and assume that the geometry of @xmath15 is asymptotically flat at infinity .",
    "the above phase space is equipped with the canonical pre - symplectic structure : @xmath20 assuming that the matter is concentrated on a shell two - surface @xmath21 , we obtain : @xmath22    the structure of the paper is following . in section [ symmetry ]",
    "we analyze the above pre - symplectic form and reduce it with respect to both the spherical symmetry and the gauss - codazzi constraints fulfilled by the adm data .",
    "it turns out that the radial component of the constraint equations gives us an `` equation of state '' which has been previously postulated in @xcite .",
    "the exact solution of the constraint equations is obtained in section [ constraints ] . using these results , both the gravitational part ( section [ grav - reduction ] ) and the matter part ( section [ mat - reduction ] ) of the symplectic form",
    "are reduced .",
    "then , an exact form of the hamiltonian of the system is derived which encodes its equations of motion .",
    "these equations are solved with respect to the schwarzschild time in section [ dynamics ] .",
    "next , we perform a transition from the schwarzschild to the minkowski time ( section [ time ] ) , and solve the resulting equations of motion . in [ lagrangians ] we discuss different models of null matter .",
    "this paper is a continuation of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most of the results presented here are contained in the ph.d .",
    "thesis @xcite of one of us ( e.c . ) .",
    "the spherical symmetry of the system implies the existence of spherical coordinates @xmath23 on the cauchy surface @xmath15 , so that initial data @xmath24 are invariant with respect to rotations . for calculational purposes",
    ", we may choose the radial coordinate in such a way that it is constant on the shell ( i.e. the history of the shell is given by the equation @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is _ not _ a physical assumption , but merely a choice of a gauge , as legal as any other gauge fixing conditions ( e.g. conditions used in @xcite ) .",
    "it considerably simplifies our calculations ( e.g. we have @xmath26 in this coordinate system , where @xmath27 denotes the one - dimensional dirac delta ) .",
    "another gauge condition which we use in this paper is the continuity of all the 10 components of the metric . in many approaches",
    "only the internal geometry of the shell is supposed to be continuous across the shell .",
    "our condition is stronger .",
    "again , this is _ not _ a physical restriction imposed on the theory but merely a gauge fixing condition which allows us to use the theory of distributions to calculate the ( singular ! ) curvature tensor . in particular",
    ", our condition implies an equivalence of the affine structure of null geodesics on the shell , as seen from both sides of the shell . without our gauge condition ,",
    "this equivalence must be imposed separately ( see @xcite for further discussion of the role of this gauge condition ) .    due to",
    "spherical symmetry the two four - geometries , which we tailor together across the shell must be schwarzschild .",
    "moreover , due to the topological triviality of the cauchy surface @xmath15 , the internal portion of the spacetime must be minkowski .",
    "we assume that asymptotically , for @xmath28 and @xmath29 , the radial coordinate is `` asymptotically flat '' , i.e. equals to the schwarzschild radius outside and the minkowski radius inside the shell .",
    "any spherically symmetric three - metric on @xmath15 has the following form : @xmath30 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the functions of a radial coordinate @xmath33 , and @xmath34 ( where @xmath35 label angular coordinates ) denotes the standard metric on the unit sphere : @xmath36 spherical symmetry also implies that the components @xmath16 of adm momenta assume the following form @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 are again the functions of the radial coordinate .",
    "these functions are piecewise smooth outside of the sphere @xmath40 , whereas the metric coefficients @xmath32 and @xmath31 are supposed to be also continuous at @xmath41 .",
    "the einstein equations imply constraints which must be satisfied by the above data , namely the gauss - codazzi equations for the components @xmath42 of the einstein tensor density .",
    "the standard decomposition of @xmath42 into the spatial ( tangent to @xmath15 ) part and the time - like ( normal to @xmath15 ) part gives us respectively : @xmath43 where @xmath32 is the future - oriented vector , orthonormal to the cauchy surface @xmath15 and @xmath44 denotes the sign of @xmath45 . in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) we have shown how to decompose these equations into the regular and the singular ( proportional to dirac delta distribution on @xmath46 ) parts .",
    "the regular part of the vector constraint reads : @xmath47 whereas the regular part of the scalar constraint reduces to : @xmath48 the singular part of the divergence of the adm  momentum @xmath49 contains derivatives in the direction of @xmath50 : @xmath51\\ , \\ ] ] where the square brackets @xmath52 $ ] denote the jump of @xmath53 between the two sides of the singular surface .",

    ", there are serious difficulties concerning the definition of such an object in case of the matter living exclusively on the null surface @xmath0 .",
    "we have shown in @xcite that such a quantity may be consistently defined .",
    "it is a three - dimensional _ tensor - density _ denoted by @xmath59 ( one three - dimensional index @xmath60 up and one index down ! ) .",
    "we stress that , due to the degeneracy ( @xmath61 ) of the metric tensor @xmath62 on @xmath0 , it is impossible to find any _ tensor _ representation of this quantity .",
    "also , the otherwise trivial `` rising of indices '' is forbidden , whereas the `` lowering '' becomes a non - invertible ( losing information ) procedure !",
    "naively , one could expect gauss - codazzi constraints in the form : @xmath63 we stress , however , that there is no way to define the right - hand side as components of any well defined four - dimensional object ! in our notation , where @xmath50 is constant on @xmath0 , only @xmath64 makes sense !",
    "fortunately , we have shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) that , due to the null character of @xmath0 , the singular part of the constraint equations contains only three conditions .",
    "indeed , the orthogonal ( to @xmath0 ) part of the constraint equation coincides with one of the tangent parts of these equations , namely the component along the null vector on @xmath0 .",
    "( the fourth constraint , existing in a non - degenerate case , is replaced here by the degeneracy condition `` @xmath65 '' for the metric on @xmath0 . )",
    "the tangent ( to @xmath0 ) part of @xmath66 splits into the two - dimensional part tangent to @xmath67 and the transversal part ( along null rays ) .",

    "to reduce the phase space with respect to these constraints we will proceed as in @xcite , but with some modification .",
    "the equation ( [ p - def ] ) , together with the vector constraint ( [ rwd ] ) , can be written in terms of momenta ( [ admmomenta ] ) : @xmath73 where prime denotes the radial derivative @xmath74 and @xmath27 is the one - dimensional dirac delta .",
    "the equation ( [ e - def ] ) , together with ( [ rsd ] ) , may be rewritten in the analogous way : @xmath75    the above constraints generate two dimensional group of space - time reparameterizations , where the variables @xmath76 may be replaced by the new variables @xmath77 , preserving the spherical symmetry of our system .",
    "gauge transformations enter as the degeneracy directions of the symplectic structure @xmath78 , obtained by the restriction of the form @xmath79 from @xmath80 to the space of the spherically symmetric data which we denote by @xmath78 . in order to calculate this restriction",
    "let us consider ( [ omega - gen - male ] ) in our specific case and integrate over angular variables @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "hence we obtain the following symmetric structure in @xmath78 : @xmath83 where we have denoted @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , for purely calculational reasons it is convenient to write the 2-form @xmath79 as an exterior derivative @xmath85 of the following 1-form : @xmath86    as already mentioned , the cauchy surface @xmath15 is tailored from two pieces : a piece of a 3-surface in the flat minkowski spacetime for @xmath87 and a piece of a 3-surface in the schwarzschild space - time for @xmath88 .",
    "in order to solve the constraint equation we have to impose a gauge condition which enables us to uniquely fix the time coordinate . for purely technical reasons",
    "we start with the family of @xmath89-gauge conditions proposed in @xcite in order to prove the positivity of the adm mass .",
    "when written in the spherical symmetric case , the condition reduces to : @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is a fixed constant .",
    "hence , we have : @xmath92 assume that @xmath93 .",
    "inserting the above relation to the vector constraint ( [ vector - spherical ] ) we see that , outside the shell , our initial data must fulfill the following equation @xmath94 this implies that the function @xmath95 is constant everywhere outside of the shell .",
    "hence , there are two constants @xmath96 and @xmath97 such that : @xmath98 the jump @xmath99 is determined by the constraint equation ( [ vector - spherical ] )  i.e. the only singular term on the right hand side of that equation is produced by the jump of @xmath39 and is equal to @xmath100 .",
    "denote the _ physical _ radius of the shell by @xmath101 : @xmath102 and the normalized radial component of the momentum by @xmath103 : @xmath104 the equation ( [ vector - spherical ] ) implies : @xmath105 to completely solve the constraint equation , the boundary conditions must be imposed , i.e. for @xmath28 the initial data must be asymptotically flat , and for @xmath106 must be regular .",
    "this implies that @xmath31 must behave like @xmath107 both at zero and at infinity , whereas @xmath39 must vanish at infinity .",
    "consequently , for @xmath108 , we obtain @xmath109 : @xmath110    now , we are going to solve the scalar constraint equation ( [ scalar - spherical ] ) . using the gauge condition",

    "this implies that @xmath117 behaves like @xmath118 and , consequently , the corresponding _ internal _ constant vanishes .",
    "denoting the remaining _ external _ constant by , , @xmath119  , we have , due to @xmath120 : @xmath121 where the sign `` @xmath122 '' appearing in the first line depends upon the sign of @xmath123 . outside of the shell",
    "this sign may change at the points where the expression under the square root vanishes . on the contrary , inside of the shell",
    "this sign is always positive , because for a space - like hypersurface in minkowski s space - time @xmath31 is always increasing .",
    "the value of @xmath124 is equal to the adm energy calculated at @xmath125 .",

    "the numerical value of @xmath124 may be obtained from the singular part of ( [ scalar - spherical ] ) .",
    "since the singular part of the right hand side of this equation is equal to the jump @xmath128 , we obtain : @xmath129 where @xmath130 denotes the sign of @xmath123 outside the shell .",
    "now we insert the value of @xmath97 calculated from ( [ a _ ] ) ( where @xmath120 ) , our  equation of state  ( [ eqos ] ) and the value of @xmath131 calculated from ( [ u ] ) . in this way",
    "we obtain : @xmath132 and , consequently : @xmath133 the value of @xmath130 can be obtained from ( [ h - aux ] ) : @xmath134    in the next section we prove that the reduced phase space for the gravitational degrees of freedom @xmath135 may be parameterized globally by the two variables @xmath101 and @xmath103 , whereas the function @xmath31 and the constants @xmath136 , @xmath89 play the role of _ gauge parameters_. given the point @xmath137 of this space , a specific choice of the gauge parameters allows us to reconstruct the entire cauchy data , with the values of @xmath138 and @xmath124 given uniquely by ( [ f- ] ) and ( [ h ] )",

    "we show that the states of the system obtained for other values of @xmath136 and @xmath31 , are equivalent up to a gauge transformation .    for negative values of @xmath89",
    "the equation ( [ f- ] ) implies that the entire external curvature vanishes outside of the shell : @xmath142 . due to the fact that the external portion of space - time is schwarzschild with the mass @xmath124 , the only surfaces satisfying this condition are standard surfaces @xmath143 .",
    "the cauchy surfaces corresponding to different negative values of @xmath89 coincide , therefore , outside of the shell and differ only inside of the shell .",
    "the dynamics of our system will be given uniquely by the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , if we only know the reduced symplectic structure expressed in terms of the gravitational variables @xmath137 and , possibly , additional matter variables .",
    "it is possible that there is no matter at all , and the matter lagrangian is equal to zero .",
    "yet , the space - time may still exhibit singularity and our `` null shell '' becomes a shock wave of pure gravitation .",
    "the phase space is then two - dimensional and the symplectic form consists of the gravitational part only .",
    "its construction is given below .",
    "we restrict the gravitational part of the symplectic form @xmath79 given by ( [ omega ] ) to the gauge space ( [ beta ] ) and express it in terms of parameters @xmath144 .",
    "it turns out that this form does not depend upon @xmath31 and @xmath136 .",
    "this proves that the latter are , indeed , gauge variables . for technical reasons it is easier to work with the 1-form @xmath145 given by ( [ lambda1 ] ) , because the restriction to the gauge space commutates with the exterior derivative of the form .",
    "formula ( [ lambda1 ] ) may be rewritten as follows : @xmath146 due to gauge condition ( [ beta ] ) , the first term in the above formula vanishes .",
    "the equation ( [ f- ] ) implies : @xmath147 where @xmath148 denotes the heaviside function .",
    "then @xmath149 and , consequently , @xmath150 because of the condition @xmath139 and due to the vanishing of @xmath39 outside of the shell .",
    "finally , we obtain @xmath151 where @xmath152 denotes @xmath153 using ( [ l - prime ] ) we obtain : @xmath154    the function @xmath31 is monotonic over the interval @xmath155 $ ] .",
    "moreover , we have : @xmath156 . hence , we may calculate the integral with respect to the following variable : @xmath157 over the interval @xmath158 $ ] .",

    "it turns out that the specific form of @xmath161 will not be needed .",
    "the first ( gravitational ) part of ( [ 34 ] ) reads : @xmath162 the first term in the above formula is a complete ( variational ) derivative .",
    "hence , it vanishes under the exterior derivative , when we calculate the symplectic form : @xmath85 .",
    "therefore , the second term alone gives us an equally good primitive form @xmath163 for @xmath79 : @xmath164 .",
    "taking into account that @xmath165 we obtain the following formula : @xmath166 where by @xmath167 we denote the momentum canonically conjugate to the variable @xmath168 : @xmath169 consequently , we have : @xmath170    finally the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) may also be expressed in terms of variables @xmath171 : @xmath172    for the shock wave , when matter degrees of freedom vanish from the very beginning , the symplectic form is of the following form @xmath173 and the hamiltonian is given by formula ( [ h - reduced ] ) , with @xmath167 and @xmath174 being now canonical variables .",
    "we are going to prove that the quantity @xmath167 may be interpreted as a hyperbolic angle between the vector normal to the external schwarzschild surface @xmath175 and the vector normal to the internal minkowski surface @xmath176 .",

    "it is sufficient to use formula ( [ l - prime ] ) . on the internal side of the shell we use the second part of the formula and put @xmath180 .",
    "we then obtain @xmath181 but inside of the shell the geometry of @xmath15 is given by a three - dimensional spherically symmetric surface in the minkowski space .",
    "it is a matter of straightforward calculations to prove that in the minkowski space - time the quantity on the left hand side of the above equation is equal to @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is precisely the angle between such a subspace and the minkowski flat surface @xmath184 .",
    "this implies that @xmath185 .",
    "but our surface is a smooth extension of the external side of the schwarzschild space @xmath186 .",
    "this finally proves that @xmath187 is the angle between the leaves of the three - dimensional foliations of the schwarzschild and the minkowski spaces .",
    "let us first consider a simple non - trivial lagrangian of the spinorial ( dirac ) type ( see [ lagrangians ] for the discussion of the properties of null matter ) : @xmath188 it implies the _ second type _",
    "constraints : @xmath189 which inserted into the symplectic form ( [ symplektyczna ] ) reduce it to the following form : @xmath190 moreover , denoting @xmath191 leads to the following symplectic structure @xmath192 in a four - dimensional phase space parameterized by variables : @xmath193 . because the hamiltonian ( [ h - reduced ] ) does not depend on the first pair of variables , hence their evolution is trivial : they remain constant in time . and the evolution equations for `` geometric variables '' @xmath194 generated by the hamiltonian ( [ h - reduced ] ) are of the following form : @xmath195 the same as in the case of the gravitational shock wave described in the previous section .",
    "it turns out that a similar reduction is valid for the generic lagrangian dependent on the two degrees of freedom ( [ lagr - mat ] ) , but , typically , the momentum @xmath167 canonically conjugated to @xmath174 shall be modified by a function @xmath196 giving the new momentum @xmath197 .",
    "consequently , the hamiltonian ( [ h - reduced ] ) depends upon the variables @xmath131 and @xmath198 via @xmath199 and the dynamics of the material variables is no longer trivial .",
    "we can see that after performing the reduction of the material part of the symplectic form ( [ symplektyczna ] ) for the two degrees of freedom @xmath200 , it has the following form @xmath201 from ( [ lagr - mat ] ) we have that : @xmath202 hence @xmath203    the assumption @xmath204 implies that @xmath205 .",
    "it is then either positive or negative , and the form @xmath206 is a symplectic form in two dimensions .",
    "besides , the darboux theorem implies that there exists such a coordinate system @xmath207 and @xmath208 in which @xmath209 therefore , @xmath210 where @xmath211 is a function of variables @xmath212 . inserting the above two equations to the formula ( [ omega - int ] ) we thus obtain @xmath79 in the following form : @xmath213 we also introduce the new canonical variables @xmath214 in order to simplify the form @xmath79 : @xmath215 the hamiltonian of the system , still equal to the same expression ( [ h - reduced ] ) , can be expressed in terms of the new variables as follows : @xmath216 this is a universal form of a hamiltonian for a spherically symmetric self - gravitating shell of null matter coupled to two matter fields .",
    "the properties of any specific model of such matter are uniquely implied by the function @xmath217 , dependent upon two material variables @xmath218 . this function",
    "is uniquely determined by the two functions @xmath219 contained in the lagrangian .",
    "* example * : consider the following lagrangian density ( see [ lagr - ex ] ) @xmath220 rewriting this lagrangian in the new variables @xmath221 and @xmath222 such that @xmath223 and @xmath224 we obtain @xmath225 the above equation expressed in terms of the canonical variables @xmath226 , @xmath227 and @xmath174 takes the following form : @xmath228 the hamiltonian of the whole system reduces to : @xmath229",
    "the hamiltonian ( [ h - reduced1 ] ) uniquely generates the dynamics of our system in the form of the following the hamilton equations for the canonical variables @xmath230 and",
    "@xmath231 : @xmath232 the first two equations can be written in term of @xmath233 and @xmath174 only .",
    "hence ( [ r - ha1 ] ) takes the universal form , identical to ( [ r - ruchu11 ] ) : @xmath234 combining it with ( [ r - ha2 ] ) , ( [ r - ha3 ] ) and ( [ r - ha4 ] ) leads to : @xmath235    again , ( [ r - ha2 ] ) and ( [ dot - alpha ] ) imply the universal equation , identical to ( [ r - ruchu12 ] ) : @xmath236 we conclude that the dynamics of the `` geometrical '' variables @xmath237 does not depend upon the choice of a model of matter and in the case @xmath238 is identical to the one from the above example .",
    "the dynamics is also identical to the case of a gravitational shock wave in empty space - time with no matter .",
    "once we know the dynamics of variables @xmath239 we can uniquely ( up to the gauge ) reconstruct the space - time in which the dynamics is realized .",
    "suppose that we have an explicit solution of ( [ r - ham1 ] ) and ( [ r - ham2 ] ) .",
    "choose a gauge @xmath108 and , separately for each moment of time , gauge variables @xmath136 and @xmath31 .",
    "this enables us to entirely reconstruct the set of the cauchy data at each instant of time separately .",
    "to reconstruct the whole geometry of space - time we also need lapse and shift functions . for this purpose",
    "let us write the einstein equations in terms of canonical variables @xmath14 and @xmath16 . because those objects are already known ( as well as their time derivatives ) at each moment of time , in result we obtain elliptic equations for the lapse and the shift . in this way for the lapse function",
    "we obtain the second order equation in variable @xmath33 as a condition for preserving of the @xmath89-gauge in time .",
    "this equation has to be solved with the following boundary conditions : @xmath240 at infinity and @xmath241 at @xmath242 .",
    "in order to calculate the shift function we have to use the equation for a time derivative of a three - dimensional metric .",
    "this is an equation of the first order with respect to the shift function and enables us to reconstruct it uniquely .      from ( [ r - ham1 ] ) and ( [ r - ham2 ] ) :",
    "@xmath243 there follows @xmath244 solution of the above equation is of the form @xmath245 therefore , we have the equation for the time evolution of @xmath167 : @xmath246 whose solution reads as @xmath247 the constant @xmath248 may be expressed in terms of the whole energy of the system : @xmath249 .",
    "the solution of ( [ r - ruchu1 ] ) for the time evolution of @xmath174 is as follows @xmath250",
    "the equations ( [ r - ham1 ] ) and ( [ r - ham2 ] ) are the same as the hamilton equations for variables @xmath251 in case when @xmath252",
    ". then , @xmath253 and @xmath251 are canonical variables . because of the identical form of the dynamical equations , in further calculations we limit ourselves to this particular case .    up to now",
    ", we have described the evolution of our system with respect to the schwarzschild time which coincides with the minkowski time at the spatial infinity .",
    "we can also describe our evolution with respect to any other time variable , corresponding to a different ( 3 + 1)-foliation of space - time .",
    "the leaves @xmath254 of the new foliation do not have to coincide with the previous hypersurfaces @xmath255 but we assume that asymptotically ( at space - infinity ) they do .    a change of the time variable is not a standard transformation in classical mechanics . here",
    ", we use the approach introduced by one of us in @xcite , based on the notion of a contact manifold .",
    "suppose that the leaves @xmath254 of the new foliation intersect the shell at the schwarzschild time @xmath256 .",
    "the quantity @xmath257 will be called a _ retardation _ of the new time variable with respect to the previous one , calculated on the shell .",
    "suppose that the value of this retardation depends upon the actual dynamical situation , i.e. upon the position and the momentum , but it does not depend explicitly upon the time variable .",
    "this means that the new gauge condition is intrinsic , depending only on initial data .",
    "the function @xmath258 contains the entire information about the transition between the old variables @xmath259 and the new ones @xmath260 because once we know @xmath259 we can solve the equations generating dynamics of a system and set @xmath261 for an arbitrary , not constant , function @xmath257 , such a transformation is , in general , not canonical .",
    "we will show in the sequel how to specify the canonical structure of our reduced phase space in terms of these new variables .",
    "for that purpose it will be convenient to use the language of contact manifolds .",
    "observe that the entire information about the dynamics of a system may be retrieved from the three - dimensional contact space , defined as the surface @xmath262 in the four - dimensional space @xmath263 equipped with the standard contact form : @xmath264 this symplectic form in the four - dimensional phase - space becomes degenerate when restricted to the surface @xmath262 .",
    "trajectories of the system are defined uniquely as those whose tangent vector belongs to this degeneracy . to prove this it is sufficient to parameterize our subspace in terms of three variables @xmath265 , and rewrite the form in the following way : @xmath266 we see that the vector annihilating the above form must be proportional to the vector @xmath267 where @xmath268 and @xmath269 are given by the hamilton equations ( [ r - ham1 ] ) and ( [ r - ham2 ] ) .    in @xcite",
    "it was shown that the choice of the new gauge condition @xmath270 is equivalent to the choice of the variable @xmath271 @xmath272 as a new time variable .",
    "let us rewrite , therefore , our symplectic form @xmath273 in terms of the new time @xmath271",
    ". it will be convenient to have the energy @xmath274 instead of @xmath167 as an independent parameter and treat @xmath167 as a function @xmath275 obtained from solving ( [ h - reduced ] ) .",
    "therefore , we have @xmath276 now define : @xmath277 where @xmath278 is arbitrary . then , we have @xmath279 where @xmath280 plays the role of the momentum canonically conjugate to @xmath281 . differentiating ( [ def - tilde - mu ] ) with respect to @xmath274 provides @xmath282    it is interesting to notice ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that any choice of the function @xmath283 leads to a certain gauge condition , i.e. to the definition of a new time parameter on the shell because we may always reconstruct the retardation function @xmath257 from ( [ diff - tilde ] ) . as an example , consider @xmath284 ( see the formula ( [ u ] ) ) which corresponds to the minkowski time calculated at the internal side of the shell .",
    "indeed , in the minkowski spacetime the momentum canonically conjugate to the shell s position @xmath101 is equal to the kinetic momentum @xmath131 .",
    "the change of the variables from @xmath101 to @xmath174 implies a transformation of momenta according to the identity : @xmath285 which , finally , gives @xmath286 when integrated over the shell .",
    "we are going to show in the sequel that the evolution defined in this way corresponds , indeed , to the minkowski time .",
    "for this purpose we express the new momentum in terms of the old one using ( [ mom - can ] ) : @xmath287 where the energy @xmath274 is equal to the value of the hamiltonian @xmath124 .",
    "but , from ( [ h - reduced ] ) , we obtain : @xmath288 and , consequently , @xmath289 on the other hand , we get from ( [ mu - def ] ) : @xmath290 thus , ( [ diff - tilde ] ) implies : @xmath291 to prove that the above quantity describes retardation between the minkowski time @xmath271 inside the shell an the extrinsic schwarzschild time @xmath271 , differentiate ( [ def - te ] ) over @xmath292 : @xmath293 where we have used the energy conservation @xmath294 .",
    "the derivative @xmath295 can be calculated from ( [ r - ham1 ] ) , and relation ( [ mu - def ] ) , leading to : @xmath296 and finally @xmath297 integrating ( [ v - po - r ] ) we obtain a retardation between the minkowski time @xmath271 and the schwarzschild time @xmath292 : @xmath298 hence @xmath299 and @xmath300 , otherwise @xmath167 would not be defined ( eq . [ e - r ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian may be expressed in terms of the minkowski variables @xmath301 : @xmath302 and the hamilton equations take the form : @xmath303 using the relations @xmath304 and ( [ t - min - sch ] ) between @xmath292 and @xmath271 we can reconstruct ( [ r - ruchu1 ] ) and ( [ r - ruchu2 ] ) .    the dynamical equations ( [ r - ruchum1 ] ) and ( [ r - ruchum2 ] ) may be explicitly solved : @xmath305 keeping in mind that @xmath306 , the above solution for @xmath101 ( linear propagation with velocity equal to @xmath307 ) is implied by the fact that the only null - like , spherically symmetric surfaces in the minkowski space are light - cones . hence , the evolution can not be global , it ends at the cone s vertex .",
    "an interesting case of the _ global _ ( in the minkowski time ) evolution is obtained when the two cones : the future oriented one and the past oriented one , cross each other .",
    "the theory of crossing shells was thoroughly analyzed in @xcite .",
    "we have derived from first principles the hamiltonian dynamics of a spherically symmetric shell of null matter . for this purpose",
    "we have imposed a strong condition : continuity of all 10 components of the metric across the shell .",
    "this is _ not _ a physical restriction , but only a gauge condition imposed on possible coordinate systems which can be used . due to this gauge condition",
    "we were able to define a singular ( dirac - delta like ) riemann tensor of a non - continuous spacetime connection @xmath308 in terms of the standard formulae of differential geometry , where derivatives are understood in the sense of distributions .",
    "imposing spherical symmetry leads to an effective reduction of the phase space of the system .",
    "the resulting `` reduced phase space '' is obtained as a quotient of an _ infinite - dimensional _ space of cauchy data with respect to the ( again _ infinite - dimensional _ ) group of gauge transformations generated by the gauss - codazzi constraints . such a complete reduction which , miraculously , leads to a _ finite dimensional _ phase space , has not been successfully performed up to now . in particular , the radial component of the constraint equations produces the `` equation of state '' ( [ eqos ] ) : a relation between the radial component of the momentum @xmath131 and the surface energy density @xmath130 on @xmath0 . in our approach the relation is not postulated but is derived as a consequence of the nullness of matter .",
    "choosing @xmath309 ( where @xmath101 is the physical radius of the shell ) as a configuration parameter of the shell , the corresponding canonical momentum was shown to be the ( hyperbolic ) angle @xmath167 between the two foliations : the schwarzschild foliation outside of the shell and the minkowski foliation inside of it .",
    "the adm energy calculated at space infinity , expressed in terms of the canonical variables @xmath310 was proved to be the hamiltonian of the complete `` gravity + matter '' system .",
    "it generates the dynamics of the canonical variables and enables us to uniquely reconstruct ( up to an arbitrary choice of the gauge ) the spacetime dynamics .",
    "we have also discussed the dependence of the above picture upon the choice of the time variable .",
    "to implement such a transformation at the level of the hamiltonian dynamics , we have proposed a new method based on the contact structure of the enlarged phase space . to illustrate this method",
    "we have shown how to transform the entire theory from the schwarzschild time , measured at space infinity , to the minkowski time , measured inside the shell .",
    "because the shell metric @xmath62 , @xmath311 is degenerate , we have _ a priori _ no standard scalar density on @xmath0 which can be used in the definition of the lagrangian .",
    "we must , therefore , manufacture such a density from the following ingredients : i ) the matter fields @xmath312 , ii ) their derivatives @xmath313 along the shell , iii ) the degeneracy field @xmath314 of @xmath62 on @xmath0 and iv ) the two - dimensional volume form @xmath315 on each surface @xmath316 .",
    "choose the field @xmath314 ( otherwise given up to a multiplicative constant ) in such a way that @xmath317 .",
    "the following object : @xmath318 , ( @xmath319 ) , is a scalar density and may be taken as a matter lagrangian .",
    "a more sophisticated example is given by @xmath320 , where @xmath221 is a scalar field , @xmath321 and @xmath322 denotes any metric tensor in the space of field variables .",
    "however , in the case of spherical symmetry we have @xmath323 and all these models lead to the trivial hamiltonian @xmath324 , which implies the equation @xmath325 .",
    "the shell surface must be , therefore , an isolated horizon ( cf .",
    "@xcite , eq .",
    "( 6.2 ) )    we are interested in examples of null - matter which may non - trivially couple to a generic null shell , not necessarily an isolated horizon .",
    "such a nontrivial example can be obtained if one considers a thin shell of matter described by the lagrangian density with at least two degrees of freedom which depends not only on velocities , but also on the configuration variables .",
    "consider the lagrangian density of the type : @xmath326 where @xmath327 , and @xmath219 is a covector field defined on the space of material variables .",
    "we show in a sequel that this leads to a non - trivial model already for the two degrees of freedom : @xmath328 . in a spherically symmetric case",
    "this lagrangian takes the form : @xmath329 the euler - lagrange equations for this system read as @xmath330 if the quantity @xmath331 is equal to zero , i.e. if @xmath161 is closed : @xmath332 , then @xmath333 , and matter described by this lagrangian density couples again to an isolated horizon .",
    "assume that @xmath334 .",
    "then the euler - lagrange equations imply the following constraints equations : @xmath335 @xmath336",
    "\\1 . a simple example of a lagrangian of the type ( [ lagrangian - main ] ) may be the following one : @xmath337 whose structure resembles the dirac lagrangian for spinor fields .",

    "@xmath339 similarly as in the spinor theory , one configuration variable ( in electrodynamics it is the imaginary part of spinor in the majorana representation ) becomes momentum canonically conjugated to the second variable ( the real part in the majorana representation ) .",
