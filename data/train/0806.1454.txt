    "recently a comprehensive study of hadronic decays of baryon resonances along relativistic constituent quark models ( rcqms ) has become available . in particular ,",
    "one considered the @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 decay modes in the light and strange baryon sectors  @xcite .",
    "the calculations were done within the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics , specifically in the point form .",
    "the covariant quark - model predictions were found to be drastically different from results of previous nonrelativistic or relativized calculations as , e.g. , in refs .  .",
    "the relativistic results for partial decay widths systematically underestimate the available experimental data .",
    "similar results for hadronic decay widths with practically the same characteristics were also seen in another relativistic study  @xcite .",
    "this is remarkable , since the latter investigation was carried out along a completely different approach using the bethe - salpeter equation  @xcite .",
    "the observed systematics of the relativistic results for decay widths has suggested to revisit the identification of quark - model eigenstates with established baryon resonances  @xcite .",
    "for instance , it was found that in the @xmath4 spectrum the lowest @xmath5 state should not be identified with the @xmath6 resonance , which is established at three - star status , but rather with the @xmath7 resonance  @xcite .",
    "the latter is often neglected because it is reported only as a two - star resonance without a @xmath8 assignment  @xcite .",
    "evidently , it is not enough to consider only energy levels to reach a conclusive classification of baryon resonances .",
    "rather one should take into account also properties relating to the resonance structure such as decay widths .",
    "theoretically one can examine the detailed spin and flavor contents as well as the spatial symmetries of all resonance states , since their wave functions are directly accessible .",
    "this leads to a consistent identification of states along @xmath0 flavor multiplets . the present work is essentially devoted to a comprehensive investigation of the multiplet classification within a covariant formalism along rcqms . in several cases",
    "this yields results different from what is understood as the usual quark - model classification .",
    "in addition , the inclusion of low - lying resonances with less than three - star status turns out to be necessary .    it is mandatory to work within a relativistic framework .",
    "obviously , the constituent quarks confined to a finite volume carry high momenta .",
    "large relativistic effects are present in all aspects of baryon states , as was found in covariant studies of electroweak nucleon form factors  , electric radii as well as magnetic moments  @xcite , and mesonic decays  @xcite . for the relativistic description we use the formalism of poincar - invariant quantum mechanics  @xcite",
    "the theory relies on a relativistically invariant mass operator , and it allows to incorporate all symmetries required by special relativity .",
    "different forms of relativistic quantum mechanics are characterized by different kinematical subgroups of the poincar group .",
    "the most common ones are the instant , front , and point forms  @xcite . here",
    "we adhere to the point form .    in the following section we shortly outline the theoretical framework and describe the specific rcqms used .",
    "the third section deals with the baryon excitation spectra as produced by the rcqms",
    ". then we discuss the mesonic decays of the established baryon resonances in comparison to the available experimental data . in the fifth section",
    "we identify the theoretical eigenstates with the phenomenologically known resonances and propose a new classification scheme for baryon ground and resonant states .",
    "there , also the spin - flavor structures as well as spatial density distributions of the various flavor - multiplet members are detailed .",
    "subsequently we discuss their decay properties and end with our conclusions .",
    "here we formulate the poincar - invariant description of baryon eigenstates . following the point form of relativistic quantum mechanics we outline the eigenvalue problem of the invariant mass operator and specify the dynamics of two different types of rcqms .      starting out from the free mass operator @xmath9 the interactions",
    "are introduced according to the bakamjian - thomas construction  @xcite .",
    "thus the free mass operator is replaced by a full mass operator @xmath10 containing an interacting term @xmath11 @xmath12 for a given baryon state of mass @xmath13 and total angular momentum ( intrinsic spin ) @xmath14 with z - projection @xmath4 the eigenvalue problem of the mass operator reads @xmath15 here we have written the eigenstates in obvious notation as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 indicates the four eigenvalues of the velocity operator @xmath18 , of which only three are independent .",
    "the four - momentum operator is then defined by multiplying the mass operator @xmath10 by the four - velocity operator @xmath19 and it becomes interaction - dependent .",
    "alternatively we can thus express the baryon eigenstates also as @xmath20 where @xmath21 represents the four eigenvalues of @xmath22 , whose square gives the invariant mass operator .",
    "the ground and resonance state wave functions are defined through the velocity - state representations of the mass - operator eigenstates @xmath23 and they are normalized to unity as @xmath24 the velocity states build a specific basis of free three - body states defined by @xmath25 \\left|p_1,p_2,p_3;\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2,\\sigma_3\\right\\rangle . \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\label{eq : velstates}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath26 , with unitary representation @xmath27 , is a boost with four - velocity @xmath28 on the free three - body states @xmath29 in the centre - of - momentum system , i.e. , for which the individual quark momenta sum up as @xmath30 . the second line in eq .",
    "( [ eq : velstates ] ) expresses the corresponding lorentz transformation as acting on general three - body states @xmath31 .",
    "the quark momenta @xmath32 and @xmath33 are related by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 are the spin-@xmath37 representation matrices of wigner rotations @xmath38 .",
    "the velocity - state representation allows to separate the motion of the system as a whole and the internal motion .",
    "the latter is described by the wave function @xmath39 , which is also the rest - frame wave function .",
    "it contains the whole information on the flavor , spin , and spatial structure of a baryon state .    in the rest frame",
    "the invariant mass operator coincides with the hamiltonian @xmath40 where the quark - quark dynamics is decomposed into a confinement and a hyperfine interaction @xmath41 while the confinement interaction is nowadays usually taken as a potential linearly rising towards longer distances ( as suggested from quantum chromodynamics ) , the hyperfine interaction is qualitatively distinct among different constituent quark models .      the goldstone - boson - exchange ( gbe ) rcqm  @xcite relies on a linear confinement potential and a hyperfine interaction that is motivated by the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "the different parts in the hamiltonian are thus represented by @xmath42 @xmath43 and",

    "( [ eq : gbehyper ] ) .",
    "this specific property is favorable for a unified description of all light and strange baryon ground and resonances states .",
    "in particular , it provides for the correct level orderings of positive- and negative - parity states in both the nucleon and @xmath47 excitation spectra .",
    "the terms @xmath48 , with @xmath49 , assume the form of instantaneous meson - exchange potentials .",
    "the parameters were determined by fitting the established baryon resonances ( with at least three - star status ) below 2 gev . in total , the gbe rcqm involves four open parameters .",
    "the detailed parametrization can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another type of rcqm consists in constructing the hyperfine interaction from one - gluon exchange ( oge ) . here",
    ", we consider in particular the relativistic variant of the bhaduri - cohler - nogami ( bcn ) oge cqm  @xcite in the parametrization of ref .",
    "the confinement interaction is given by @xmath50 and the hyperfine potential relies on the ( flavor - independent ) color - magnetic spin - spin interaction @xmath51 the oge rcqm also has four open parameters that were obtained through a fit to the baryon spectrum .",

    "the solution of the eigenvalue problem of the mass operator @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mass ] ) has been performed with the stochastic variational method ( svm )  @xcite .",
    "thereby we have produced the invariant mass spectra of all the light and strange baryons .",
    "in addition we have obtained the rest - frame wave functions of all ground and resonance states .",
    "the energy eigenvalues of the ground states and resonances below @xmath53 gev as resulting with the gbe and oge rcqms are quoted in table  [ tab : masses ] . here",
    ", only eigenstates with ( rest - frame ) total orbital angular momentum @xmath54 are considered , as the theoretical decay properties necessary in the present work are available only for such states  @xcite . for the complete spectra of the gbe and oge rcqms we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , respectively .",
    "the same results are depicted also in figs .",
    "[ fig : ndel ] and  [ fig : lasig ] in comparison to the phenomenological data by the pdg  @xcite .",
    "the left ( red ) lines in each one of the @xmath8 columns denote the energy levels produced by the oge rcqm , while the right ( red ) lines belong to the gbe rcqm . with respect to the number of states below about 2 gev",
    "one immediately observes a one - to - one correspondence between theory and experiment in each one of the @xmath8 sets in the light - flavor sector ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ndel ] ) . in the strange sector",
    "[ fig : lasig ] ) , however , there would be more theoretical levels than experimental ones , if only established resonances ( with at least three - star status ) were taken into account .",
    "for instance , in the @xmath5 column of the @xmath4 excitation spectrum the rcqms produce three states , while there is only one established resonance reported .",
    "this problem is remedied , if one includes also the two lower - lying resonances @xmath7 and @xmath55 , as is done in fig .",
    "[ fig : lasig ] . of course",
    ", these two resonances have only a two - star confidence status and the @xmath8 value is only known for the latter . as will become clear in the subsequent sections , these additional states are required and can / should be accommodated in a consistent classification into @xmath0 flavor multiplets .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the @xmath56 @xmath4 spectrum , where the rcqms again produce three levels , while the pdg reports only two established resonances . in this case",
    ", however , there is essentially no further candidate seen in experiment , even not with one- or two - star status .",
    "therefore the rcqm state that misses a corresponding experimental counterpart ( the last @xmath4 entry in table  [ tab : masses ] ) is indicated by dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : lasig ] .",
    "nevertheless , all of these three theoretical states fit into the @xmath0 multiplet classification we propose in the following sections .    the pdg  @xcite gives assignments of baryon states ( for @xmath54 ) in terms of flavor multiplets as summarized in table  [ tab : multiplet_pdg ] . in this context",
    "not only established ( three- and four - star ) resonances are included but also some two - star states . besides the octet and decuplet of ground states only one more multiplet is complete , namely , the octet of the lowest @xmath56 excitations ( involving the @xmath57 resonance ) .",
    "all other multiplets miss at least a @xmath58 , the decuplets in addition also a @xmath4 .",
    "the assignments of some states , especially of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , are merely based on educated guesses  @xcite .",
    "the resulting scheme is mostly in line with the one by samios et al .",
    "@xcite proposed back in 1974 , when many of the resonances known today have not yet been found from pehenomenology .    to a large extent",
    "the pdg classification also coincides with a more recent one by guzey and polyakov ( gp )  @xcite .",
    "there occur only differences with regard to the identification of the @xmath55 in the @xmath5 octet , involving the @xmath61 , and the @xmath6 in the @xmath5 octet , involving the @xmath62 ; according to gp the @xmath6 falls into the @xmath5 decuplet involving the @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , some further states without assignment by the pdg were included by gp , such as the three - star resonances @xmath64 and @xmath65 as well as the two - star resonances @xmath7 and @xmath66 .",
    "all of the latter will also be considered ( and needed ) in the classification we elaborate and propose below .",
    "the mesonic decays of the baryon resonances from figs .",
    "[ fig : ndel ] and  [ fig : lasig ] were comprehensively studied with regard to their @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 decay modes within a relativistic framework  @xcite . in these",
    "works the decay operator was constructed along the point - form spectator model ( pfsm )  @xcite .",
    "it consists in the simplifying assumption that the meson is emitted from one quark while the other two act as spectators .",
    "the pfsm decay operator is manifestly covariant and it preserves its spectator - model character in all reference frames .",
    "though it formally looks like a one - body operator , it nevertheless includes many - body effects  @xcite .",
    "in particular , the recoil effect on the residual baryon state is naturally taken into account .",
    "the nonrelativistic limit of the pfsm leads to the familiar elementary emission model ( eem ) .    from the covariant pfsm calculations a new pattern of partial decay widths as predicted by modern rcqms",
    "has emerged .",
    "it has turned out to be rather different from what had been known from previous nonrelativistic or relativized studies .",
    "notably , quite large relativistic effects have been detected , and the results generally underestimate the experimental data . in this context",
    "it is remarkable that quite similar findings have been obtained by the bonn group from a completely different relativistic investigation along the bethe - salpeter formalism  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_graph_est ] the situation is exemplified with regard to the low - lying octet baryon resonances for which partial decay widths are reported by the pdg .",
    "the theoretical decay widths as resulting with the gbe rcqm are depicted as percentages of the ( best estimates of the ) experimental data . in each octet one",
    "observes a clear pattern : the magnitudes of the theoretical widths remain far below the experimental measurements , i.e. they lie to the left of the vertical 100% lines .",
    "there are only a few exceptions . in the octet involving the @xmath67 the decay width for the @xmath68 mode appears to be unusually large .",
    "the same is true for the @xmath69 decays in the @xmath61 and @xmath57 octets .",
    "regarding the @xmath2 decays the relatively large percentages should not be taken too serious in the cases of @xmath70 and @xmath71 as the magnitudes of the experimental widths are very small , practically identical to zero . in the @xmath2 channel",
    "only two partial widths are sizable , namely the ones of @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the latter one comes out considerably larger than experimentally measured .",
    "this must be considered as a notorious problem of constituent quark models and may point to an unidentified deficiency in the decay operator and/or resonance wave function .    of particular interest in the context of the present study",
    "are the @xmath1 decays of the @xmath5 @xmath4 resonances . out of the three eigenstates appearing in fig .",
    "[ fig : lasig ] two of them are octets , as can be clearly determined from the rcqm calculations .",
    "if one considers only resonances with at least three - star status and known phenomenological partial decay widths , these two octet states should be related to the @xmath6 resonance . in fig .",
    "[ fig : decay_graph_est ] their @xmath72 decay widths are represented relative to the experimental width measured for @xmath6 .",
    "they are denoted by the double triangles , since for both octet states when interpreted in this manner the theoretical results grossly overshoot the data .",
    "however , we must consider that there are two further @xmath4 resonances observed in experiments that may be taken as candidates for the identification of the @xmath5 eigenstates , namely the unassigned @xmath7 and the @xmath5 @xmath55 , both with two - star status . if the @xmath5 @xmath4 octet states are related to these resonances , then the third eigenstate , found to be a decuplet state in the rcqm calculations , has to be interpreted as @xmath6 . in this way",
    "the decay widths of all three @xmath5 @xmath4 fit into the general pattern of relativistic mesonic decay widths  @xcite ( cf .",
    "the results presented in section  [ sec : mesdecay ] below ) .",
    "one may ask for the causes of the deficiencies of the relativistic spectator - model calculations , especially also in view of results existing in the literature with apparently better agreement with phenomenology .",
    "past studies have revealed that a nonrelativistic spectator - model decay operator , such as the eem , is not sufficiently sophisticated to yield a reasonable description of the mesonic decays .",
    "a more elaborate decay mechanism is provided , for example , by the relativized pair - creation model ( pcm )  @xcite .",
    "studies along this line were performed among others in refs .",
    "all of these works have in common that some additional parametrizations were introduced on top of the direct predictions of the underlying constituent quark models . in this way one adjusted the extensions of the meson - creation vertices and/or the coupling strengths .",
    "furthermore , different phase - space factors were employed in the decay amplitude . as a result",
    "the different approaches can hardly be compared to each other and the degree of agreement with experimental data does not really allow to judge on the appropriateness of the approach followed .",
    "so , it could well be that missing relativistic effects or other shortcomings either of the quark - model wave functions or the decay operator were compensated by introducing ad - hoc parameters .    for the relativistic results of decay widths reported in refs .",
    "@xcite as well as in refs .",
    "@xcite one refrained from applying any additional parametrization to the predictions of the rcqms .",
    "even though in these works by the bonn and graz groups different rcqms were employed and distinct relativistic approaches were followed , the predicted decay widths came out surprisingly similar .",
    "this might be a consequence of implementing full poincar invariance , which is strictly observed in our point - form approach and similarly in the bethe - salpeter formalism followed by the bonn group . in both types of relativistic studies",
    "one lacks substantial contributions to the mesonic decay widths .",
    "one is left with a systematic underestimation of the experimental data with only a few exceptional cases . in view of the present insight",
    "it is difficult to decide from where the defects come .",
    "however , one must bear in mind that in present - day constituent quark models the baryon ground and resonance states are all described as bound three - quark eigenstates of the invariant mass operator .",
    "in addition , the decay operators used so far might miss important contributions from explicit many - body parts .",
    "still , the covariant results achieved so far can serve as benchmarks and provide a solid basis for further explorations .    in the following section we present a classification of the singlet , octet , and decuplet baryon resonances based on the evidences of their properties from the mass spectra , the mesonic decay widths as well as the spin - flavor contents and the spatial structures of the wave functions .",
    "it will turn out that for a comprehensive classification of the various states we shall need to consider the decay widths of additional rcqm eigenstates beyond the results already published in refs .",
    "the corresponding predictions are collected in table  [ tab : multi3 ] .",
    "in order to arrive at a conclusive assignment of rcqm eigenstates to @xmath0 multiplets we now analyze the spin - flavor contents and spatial structures of the baryon wave functions . through the results from the solution of the mass - operator eigenvalue problem with the svm we have access to their detailed dependences on flavor , spin , and spatial variables .",
    "the svm uses a completely general basis of flavor , spin , and spatial test functions . in the process of stochastic variation",
    "they are selected by varying all flavor , spin , orbital angular momentum , and radial dependences so as to couple to baryon states characterized by definite intrinsic spin @xmath14 , @xmath73-component @xmath4 , hypercharge @xmath74 , total isospin @xmath75 as well as isospin @xmath73-component @xmath76 ( for details see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in practice",
    "the eigenvalue problem is solved in the rest frame of the corresponding state , where the point - form version of relativistic quantum mechanics is employed .",
    "we note , however , that the solution for the mass spectra is relativistically invariant and thus independent of the specific form of relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "in our solution of the mass - operator eigenvalue problem ( in the rest frame ) utilizing the svm , the total orbital angular momentum is restricted to @xmath54 .",
    "even higher angular - momentum components have turned out to be rather small and may be neglected for the ground and resonance states considered here . for any eigenstate",
    "the total spin @xmath77 is definitely determined . @xmath78 and @xmath77 uniquely produce the intrinsic spin @xmath14 and parity @xmath21 .    with regard to the flavor content",
    ", the svm may pick up basis states from different @xmath0 flavor multiplets .",
    "in particular , mixtures of flavor contributions from singlet and octet as well as octet and decuplet can occur .",
    "this happens specifically for the @xmath47 , @xmath4 , and @xmath58 hyperons . for their mass - operator eigenstates we can easily determine the singlet , octet , and decuplet contents , respectively .",
    "for this purpose we employ the appropriate flavor projection operators . for the singlet it reads @xmath79 evidently it sorts out the completely antisymmetric singlet component of a certain baryon state whose probability is then given by @xmath80 for the special case of singlet - octet mixing , such as @xmath47 , the octet probability is then simply @xmath81 similarly , for the @xmath4 and @xmath58 baryons",
    ", mixtures between flavor octet and decuplet can occur . here",
    ", we determine the decuplet content by employing the decuplet projection operator @xmath82 . in case of @xmath4",
    "it suffices to consider the corresponding projection operator for @xmath83 @xmath84 since the decuplet content is the same for @xmath85 and @xmath86 due to isospin symmetry .",
    "analogous considerations hold for the @xmath58 states , and we may use the decuplet projection operator @xmath87 again , the octet content is obtained by @xmath88      for the characterization of the spatial structure of any baryon ground state or resonance we consider the angle - integrated spatial probability density distribution @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the jacobi coordinates .",
    "it provides an idea of the matter distribution in a baryon . in fig .",
    "[ fig : gbe - oge - wf ] probability density distributions are exemplified for the nucleon ground state and the roper resonance . whereas the nucleon shows a rather symmetric shape with the density distribution peaked at a root - mean - square radius of about 0.3 fm ,",
    "the @xmath92 exhibits the typical behaviour of a first radial excitation , i.e. with a nodal line in the wave function .",
    "one also observes that @xmath93 is very similar for both the gbe and oge rcqms .",
    "the latter is slightly more localized , as its confinement interaction is relatively stronger . in the following subsections",
    "we therefore restrict ourselves to showing only the probability density distributions for the gbe rcqm .      for the relativistic mass - operator eigenstates we obtain the flavor multiplet classifications as given in tables  [ tab : multiplet_oct ] ,  [ tab : multiplet_decu ] , and  [ tab : multiplet_singl ] .",
    "we group the states according to their @xmath94 values which determine the @xmath8 .",
    "evidently not all states have a pure singlet , octet , or decuplet content .",
    "in particular , considerable admixtures can occur for the @xmath47 singlet and octet states .",
    "the identification of the octet ground states is natural , all bear total intrinsic spin and parity @xmath99 , and they have pure octet flavor content .",
    "the corresponding spatial probability densities are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi_1 ] .",
    "they all exhibit the typical behaviour of ground states with no nodal lines .",
    "it should be noted that with these eigenstates all electroweak properties of the nucleons as well as the electric radii and magnetic moments of the other ground states are predicted in good agreement with experiment  @xcite .",
    "the classification of the lowest decuplet states @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 is also straightforward .",
    "all are characterized by @xmath108 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "the eigenstates are totally symmetric with respect to spin and flavour .",
    "this leads to similar spatial probability densities as for the octet ground states but with a larger extension ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : multi_2 ] ) .      the states @xmath92 , @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath64 represent the first radial excitations with @xmath99 above the octet ground states .",

    "[ fig : multi_3 ] , with all of them exhibiting the typical nodal structures .",

    "as we shall see in the next section , the decay width of the theoretical @xmath99 @xmath58 state at least fits into the general pattern observed for the pfsm results and the magnitude of the total width is in line with the value measured by the babar collaboration  @xcite . on the other hand , in a recent study pervin and roberts",

    "more conclusive experimental data on this state would be highly welcome in order to clarify the situation with respect to its parity .      for the second octet of excited states with @xmath99 we can only classify the @xmath67 and the @xmath119 .",

    "are characterized by the typical spatial probability density distributions of second radial excitations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi_4 ] , with a dip following a straight line through the origin of the ( @xmath121 ) plane .",
    "the flavor content of these two resonances is practically pure octet .",
    "the @xmath119 resonance has only two - star status , while its @xmath8 is experimentally confirmed to be @xmath122 . besides the @xmath55 it is the only two - star resonance that is taken into account by the pdg , and",
    "they classify it into the same octet as we do .",
    "the pdg classifies also the @xmath59 to be a member of this octet .",
    "however , in the rcqms no flavor octet @xmath47 state with @xmath99 is found below 2 gev , rather one obtains a flavor singlet .",
    "thus the classification of the @xmath47 and likewise the @xmath58 members of this octet must be left open , as the possible candidates @xmath123 and @xmath124 , or even higher @xmath58 s , are not well enough established experimentally .",
    "the rcqms produce a @xmath99 with @xmath109 and @xmath120 at an energy of 1799 and 1957 mev for the gbe an oge hyperfine interactions , respectively .",
    "they are definitely flavor singlets with only a few percents of octet admixture .",
    "no other suitable @xmath47 resonances are found below 2 gev .",
    "therefore we identify this @xmath99 eigenstate with the @xmath59 . while this classification differs from the one by the pdg , the same identification as ours is also suggested by matagne and stancu  @xcite .",
    "the probability density distribution of the @xmath59 is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : multi_6 ] .",
    "the state @xmath127 is predominantly a flavour singlet with @xmath5 , and it is constructed from @xmath128 and @xmath120 .",
    "the octet admixture is about one third , by far larger as in the case of @xmath59 . the corresponding probability density distribution is also shown in fig .  [ fig : multi_6 ] .",
    "it should be mentioned that the @xmath127 represents a notorious difficulty in reproducing its mass for all constituent quark models relying on \\{qqq } configurations , very probably because the mass value happens to lie so close to the @xmath129 threshold .",
    "the next higher @xmath47 eigenstate is an octet and it should thus be identified with the @xmath130 ( see below ) .",
