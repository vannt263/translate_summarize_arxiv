    ", independent - particle description of the process suggests that the @xmath0 cross section should be given by a set of discrete peaks  each corresponding to knock - out from a given nuclear shell  with the momentum distribution obtained by integrating the strength under these peaks .",
    "this description is nearly adequate for states near the fermi surface , yet additional study has revealed that the single - particle strength is strongly fragmented for deeply bound states  @xcite .",
    "knock - out from states near the fermi surface does support the notion of unfragmented single - particle strength , but the occupancy of these states is less than one  @xcite .",
    "these results show conclusively that the traditional picture of the nucleus , as a collection of particles moving independently in a mean - field potential , is too naive .",
    "consequently , the @xmath0 reaction shows the limitations of an independent - particle picture , yet it provides a fruitful testing ground for various dynamical mechanisms , such as short - range correlations , that go beyond a simple mean - field approach .",
    "the @xmath0 reaction has also been used to study possible medium modifications to the electromagnetic coupling of the nucleon  @xcite . that such effects exist",
    "has been suggested by a variety of studies .",
    "the original european - muon - collaboration ( emc ) effect , for example , can be explained by a softening of the quark momentum distribution in the nuclear medium  @xcite , which , in turn , modifies the nucleon s electromagnetic coupling .",
    "interest in the @xmath0 reaction has been recently stimulated by suggestions that color transparency may manifest itself as an asymmetry  @xcite in the missing - momentum distribution , even in the absence of a modification of the total cross section @xcite .",
    "`` color transparency '' describes the hypothesis that hadrons produced with large laboratory momenta in certain exclusive reactions with nuclear targets interact in an anomalously weak manner with the residual nucleus  @xcite .",
    "we shall not concern ourselves directly with color transparency , yet part of our interest in considering conventional relativistic effects in the @xmath0 reaction is to the end of establishing a robust `` baseline '' calculation , against which possible novel effects may be inferred .",
    "the possible existence of color transparency has been discussed in a great many different exclusive processes , yet the focus on the ne18 experiment at slac has made the quasielastic @xmath0 reaction the paradigm  @xcite . with the advent of cebaf ,",

    "our purpose is to explore the asymmetry in the missing momentum distribution in a conventional @xmath0 calculation . for concreteness ,",
    "let us now quantify what we mean by the `` asymmetry . ''",
    "we consider the @xmath0 reaction in the kinematics where the three - momentum transfer @xmath1 and the transverse missing momentum @xmath2 are fixed ( in all that follows , `` longitudinal '' and `` transverse '' are defined as the components parallel and perpendicular to @xmath1 , respectively ) . with this choice of kinematics , the longitudinal momentum distribution of the bound proton is scanned by varying the energy transfer to the nucleus  this results in a varying momentum for the outgoing proton .",
    "the asymmetry is , then , defined as the integrated sum of events with positive longitudinal missing momentum relative to those events having negative missing momentum  @xcite . here",

    "a calculation in a nonrelativistic plane - wave impulse approximation has no such asymmetry .",
    "the asymmetry at low momentum transfers is understood to arise from the momentum dependence of the distortions that the struck proton suffers in its exit from the nucleus  @xcite . in the momentum transfer regime beyond @xmath7 ,",
    "nuclear quasielastic electron scattering is essentially unexplored ; this frontier provides a non - trivial testing ground for phenomenologies constructed in a lower energy regime . at large momenta",
    ", glauber theory has been used to define the `` baseline '' .",
    "the attenuation of the ejected proton through the nucleus is given in this model by the inelastic proton - nucleon cross section .",
    "for proton momenta in excess of 3 gev , the inelastic cross section is approximately constant , so that the asymmetry is essentially zero .    the virtue of the asymmetry as a signal of transparency rests wholly on the assumption that such an asymmetry is absent in any conventional ( i.e. , without transparency ) calculation of the @xmath0 reaction at large momentum transfers .",
    "we shall show that this assumption is flawed .",
    "relativistic effects , even in a plane - wave impulse approximation , serve to generate an asymmetry in the @xmath0 reaction . in a previous work",
    ", one of us examined the role of relativity on the spectral function  @xcite . in that context , relativistic effects , driven by particle - antiparticle mixing , are responsible for generating features , such as a fragmentation of the single - particle strength , which are associated nonrelativistically with physics beyond the mean - field level .",
    "these relativistic effects exist even if a mean - field ground state is used .",
    "as relativity generates effects similar to what a more complicated nonrelativistic calculation would generate , they can not be regarded as a definitive relativistic signature .",
    "here we consider an effect which is absent in the conventional nonrelativistic formalism at the plane - wave level .",
    "moreover , including distortions as in the glauber theory also results in a small asymmetry at large momentum transfers .",
    "in contrast , relativistic corrections increase with the momentum transfer to the nucleus and can become large .",

    "[ secformal ] we review some general properties of the @xmath0 reaction and develop analytic expressions for the nuclear response in a relativistic plane - wave impulse approximation .",

    "for example , final - state interactions ( fsi ) between the outgoing nucleon and the residual nucleus are known to modify the plane - wave picture .",
    "of particular relevance to our present work is the symmetry in the missing - momentum distribution predicted in the nonrelativistic pwia .",

    ", we obtain the following limits for the other previously defined kinematical variables    @xmath95    these relations imply , in particular , that the following ratio of anomalous to dirac form factors becomes @xmath96   \\rightarrow   { \\kappa_{p } \\over ( 1+\\kappa_{p } ) } \\;,\\ ] ] so that one finds the following simple expression for the reduced cross section : @xmath97^{2 } \\;.\\ ] ] this result indicates that the longitudinal asymmetry is enhanced not only by the in - medium wave function ratio of ( @xmath98 ) but also by an additional factor of [ @xmath99 .    in fig .",
    "[ figthree ] we show , for completeness , the transverse asymmetry .",
    "the transverse response is an intrinsically relativistic observable , so that the transverse asymmetry is large even at small momentum transfers .",
    "the asymmetry , however , saturates rapidly , as reflected by the high - energy limit of the reduced cross section : @xmath100^{2 } \\;.\\ ] ] we conclude this section with a brief discussion of distortion effects .",
    "a nonrelativistic analysis of the @xmath0 reaction generates an asymmetry in the missing - momentum distribution when distortion effects are included , at low energies . at high energies , however",
    ", a glauber analysis suggests that the symmetry should be restored .",
    "relativistically , however , the energy dependence of the distorting potential depends strongly on its lorentz character and can be substantially different from its nonrelativistic counterpart  @xcite .",
    "distortions play an important role in the conservation of the electromagnetic current .",
    "electromagnetic gauge invariance has been lost as a result of our plane - wave treatment , and distortions play a fundamental role in its restoration .",
    "the included distortions , however , must be consistent with the mean - field potential used to obtain the single - particle spectrum .",
    "hence , in calculating the distorted wave for the outgoing proton , we have employed the same real and energy - independent potential used to generate the mean - field ground state .",
    "unfortunately , this treatment implies that the imaginary part of the nucleon self - energy  which is physically important  has been suppressed . in spite of this",
    ", we have calculated the nuclear response in a relativistic distorted - wave impulse approximation ( rdwia ) , in order to show what impact the restoration of gauge invariance has on the asymmetry .",
    "as we shall see , the longitudinal asymmetry remains large in the presence of the included distortions .",
    "the incorporation of absorptive and energy - dependent effects in a calculation with electromagnetic gauge invariance remains an important open problem .    in fig .",
    "[ figfour ] we show the longitudinal reduced cross section as a function of the missing momentum for the two valence orbitals in @xmath8o at @xmath101  gev .",
    "the dashed line is the relativistic plane - wave result also shown in fig .",
    "[ figone ] .",
    "the symmetric distribution ( dot - dashed line ) results from neglecting the lower component of the bound - state wave function in the rpwia calculation .",
    "this represents our best attempt in generating a nonrelativistic result .",
    "finally , relativistic distorted - wave results are shown by the solid line .",
    "the positive shift in the rdwia distribution relative to the plane - wave result is due to the repulsive character of the real distorting potential .",
    "the self - consistent , mean - field potential employed in the rdwia calculation becomes repulsive for a kinetic energy of @xmath102  mev ( @xmath103  mev ) .",
    "this implies that at a momentum transfer of @xmath101  gev the distorting potential is repulsive over the entire range of missing momenta shown in the figure , thus , producing the observed shift . in table",
    "[ tableone ] we display the sensitivity of the longitudinal asymmetry to distortion effects .",
    "the rdwia asymmetry is consistently larger than the plane - wave results due to the added effect of the repulsive distorting potential .",
    "we have calculated the asymmetry in the missing - momentum distribution from the @xmath0 reaction in a relativistic plane - wave impulse approximation , using a mean - field approximation to the walecka model .",
    "longitudinal and transverse nuclear - response functions have been evaluated in parallel kinematics as a function of the three - momentum transfer to the nucleus . by dividing out off - shell , single - nucleon form factors from the response functions",
    ", we were able to define a nonrelativistic plane - wave limit with a symmetric momentum distribution .",
    "this provides a baseline for comparing different theoretical mechanisms of breaking the symmetry .    in a relativistic formalism",
    "the presence of a lower component in the dirac bound - state wave function is sufficient to break the symmetry at the plane - wave level .",
    "we have developed analytic expressions for the plane - wave responses and have illustrated our findings by calculating the missing - momentum asymmetry using @xmath8o as an example .",
    "the ground state for @xmath8o was generated self - consistently in a mean - field approximation to the walecka model .",
    "the mean - field approximation is characterized by the presence of strong ( attractive ) scalar and ( repulsive ) timelike vector potentials .",
    "the scalar potential leads to a reduction of the effective nucleon mass in the medium and is , ultimately , responsible for a substantial enhancement of the ratio of upper to lower components in the bound - state wave function .",
    "this dynamical enhancement of the ratio , together with the increasing importance of the relativistic corrections with momentum transfer , yield longitudinal asymmetries as large as @xmath104 for a three - momentum transfer of @xmath105gev .",
    "these nuclear - structure effects preclude the use of the asymmetry in the missing - momentum distribution as a definitive signature of color transparency .",
    "however , the missing - momentum asymmetry does provide interesting information about the role of relativity in the nuclear medium .",
    "we have also investigated the effects of distortions .",
    "we include distortions to assess the impact of the restoration of gauge invariance on the asymmetry .",
    "the rdwia calculations yield a larger longitudinal asymmetry than in the plane - wave case .",
    "this results from the repulsive character of the real distorting potential .",
    "we have stressed that a distorting potential consistent with the mean field used to generate the nuclear ground state is essential for the conservation of the electromagnetic current .",
    "these mean - field distortions ignore , however , some important physics  absorption and energy - dependence  associated with the in - medium propagation of the outgoing proton .",
    "we believe that a gauge - invariant treatment of the @xmath0 reaction that successfully describes the distortions of the outgoing proton is an important area for future work .",
