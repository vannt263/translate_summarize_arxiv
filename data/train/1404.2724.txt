    "intratumor heterogeneity ( ith ) , referring to biological differences between malignant cells within the same tumor , is considered to be a major obstacle in successful eradicating tumors  @xcite .",
    "while normal cells respond very similarly to drugs , mechanisms of resistance of cancer cells are extremely diverse @xcite , which poses real challenge for targeted therapies .",
    "therefore , the development of novel effective cancer treatment strategies requires deep understanding causes and consequences of high variability of cancer cells , and , eventually ,",
    "its control .",
    "ith at the level of dna sequences ( below denoted as genetic ) is well understood as necessary prerequisite of cancer evolution . on the other hand ,",
    "emerging evidence supports the view , that the ability of cancer cells to switch between alternative states ( or phenotypes ) without the change of their genotype , known as plasticity , may be essential in many cancer types @xcite .",
    "the role of this non - genetic ( or epigenetic ) part of ith in cancer progression is , however , from evolutionary viewpoint less obvious @xcite .",
    "the evidence accumulates , that dynamic and reversible phenotype plasticity may constitute an `` escape route '' for cancer cells which may become more invasive and resistant to therapy @xcite .    cancer research usually concentrates on molecular details , implicitly presuming predominance of determinism in cancer causation . taking into account",
    "that ith results from specifically altered biochemical interactions of the cells with their environment @xcite , the effort to understand specific biochemistry of cancer cell for its therapeutic application is understandable .",
    "however , as ith _ by definition _ represents collective property of the cells population , its role is conceived with difficulty from the single - cell viewpoint .",
    "the recognition that the stochasticity of molecular processes itself induces heterogeneity of responses to drugs , which may have clinical impact even in the case of genetically identical cells under identical physical conditions @xcite , underlines necessity to integrate stochastic aspect of cancer progression into cancer models .",
    "being driven by the two components , genetic and environmental , development of ith becomes extremely complex phenomenon , which may be quantified by different measures , most of them coming from statistical mechanics , e. g. entropy concept @xcite .",
    "transforming ith into a tractable and computable property of the population of cells provides a rigorous starting point for developing mathematical cancer models and simulations @xcite .    in the paper",
    "we presume , that statistics of ith plays in cancer initiation and progression important role _ per se _ and , moreover , it may be studied separately from underlying it biochemistry . instead of trying to be ( too ) detailed in some of the aspects , we put the emphasis on the integration of the universal evolutionary features into the overall scenario .",
    "applied markovian - based framework enables to study universal causative role of environmental dynamics on the heterogeneity of the population of asexually reproducing units ( `` cells '' ) .",
    "cell states heterogeneity is bound with environmental statistics by making transition probabilities dependent on generalized distances between probability distribution functions corresponding to environment and the cell states , respectively .",
    "it is often reported that tumor propagating cells are maintained by stochastic , rather than deterministic , mechanisms which are , at least , partially reversible @xcite .",
    "it was observed @xcite that the population of human breast cancer cells consists of three phenotypically different sub - populations ( consisting of stem , basal and luminal cells , respectively ) . by studying dynamics of these cell type fractions",
    "it was found , that they stay , under stationary conditions , in equilibrium proportions  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "if the cancer cells population was purified for any of the three cell types , the equilibrium was re - established too rapidly to be explained by differential growth rates of the respective cell types fractions and it was proposed that phenotypic equilibrium was maintained by stochastic transitions between different cell states .",
    "assuming that the transition rates per unit time are , under fixed genetic and environmental conditions , constant , the cell transitions dynamics was identified with markovian process  @xcite .",
    "strong motivation for this comes from physics , where markovian processes are routinely applied to model dynamical systems which are , at any given time , exactly in one from discrete number of states @xmath0 , and where the transitions between states are treated probabilistically . within markovian formalism ,",
    "the continuous time @xmath1 variation of the probability obeys well known first - order phenomenological master equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are probabilities that the system is in the @xmath5-th state and @xmath6 , @xmath7 are transition probabilities @xmath8-th to the @xmath5-th state per unit time .",
    "the underlying principle of the above equation , stating that the appropriate constant transition probabilities may produce physically correct stationary distributions , has been exploited in the design of monte carlo importance sampling simulation techniques @xcite .",
    "identification of the cell - state dynamics with markovian process enables to study statistical aspects of population dynamics separately from the details of underlying it biochemistry , which stay hidden in the probabilities of transitions between states . despite the fact , that biochemical processes behind the respective transitions are very probably interdependent",
    ", huge complexity of the problem leaves the opportunity to get , in principle , any equilibrium distribution of the cell states by many alternative transition matrices .",
    "consistently with this , many paths and mechanisms of transitions between cell states ( phenotype switching ) are observed at molecular , genetic and expression levels  @xcite and theoretically studied  @xcite .",
    "it is well accepted that each cancer case represents evolutionary process progressing during the individuum s lifetime @xcite .",
    "a range of studies suggests that phenotype heterogeneity results from the evolutionary pressure to keep gene expression in tune with physiological needs dictated by the environment @xcite .",
    "below we construct markovian - based formal framework to integrate phenotype heterogeneity into evolutionary scenario using the above model by gupta et al .",
    "@xcite as starting point . within the framework ,",
    "phenotype heterogeneity is naturally identified with the limiting distribution of states of the respective markovian process .",
    "consequently , as the limiting distribution unambiguously results from the transition probabilities ( summarily denoted as the transition matrix ) , the evolutionary pressure imprints them into the genes . apart from being hard - wired in the genes , the transition probabilities may be influenced by instantaneous microenvironment as well .",
    "regarding the environment sensing , the transition ( or switching ) is usually termed as responsive if it occurs as a direct response to some environmental stimulus , or stochastic if no direct environment stimulus is present @xcite .",
    "being demonstrated that population of breast cancer cells purified for one of the stable cell types converges in stationary conditions gradually to original ( equilibrium ) phenotypic fractions  @xcite ( instead of immediate leap to phenotypically homogeneous population ) indicates that responsive switching is not the exclusive cause of the transitions between the states .",
    "the causation of transitions crucially predetermines mathematical form of the transition probabilities and limiting distribution .",
    "when @xmath6 are constant ( due to the stationarity of environment or the cell s insensitivity to environmental non - stationarity ) , the cell states dynamics represents markovian process .",
    "when the influence from the environmental non - stationarity can not be neglected , @xmath9 are time - dependent and the process becomes non - stationary ( time - inhomogeneous markov process ) . in the next",
    "we assume that evolving population is influenced by time - varying environment and we focus on the inherent structure of time - dependent @xmath9 at phenomenological level . below proposed structure of @xmath9 preserves markovian property of the cell state dynamics and , on the other hand , enables to study non - equilibrium phenomena which reflect temporal variability of the environment .",
    "the probability of transition between two states typically derives from the distinction in some of their characteristics , such as energy levels in metropolis monte carlo method in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "non - stationarity of transition probabilities due to environment fluctuations prevents the system from reaching limiting distribution consisting of a few unique states .",
    "however , when the fluctuations of environment are not correlated with the environmental average , one can intuitively replace the concept of limiting distribution with the notion of probability distribution represented by the superposition of appropriately approximated peaks of nonzero width around the lines corresponding to the pure states which would result from the stationary ( evolutionary tuned ) transition matrix .",
    "consequently , the question arises what is the quantity the probability of which is distributed .",
    "regarding the main aim of this study , which is proposing formal framework enabling to explore how environment statistics exerts evolutionary pressure on the statistics of evolving population , the probability distribution relates to the effective parameter integrating all the relevant environmental factors which influence transition probabilities , below referred to as environmental cue. it relates to the environment itself , which is viewed as its donor , as well as to the cell states , which plays the role of its eventual recipient .",
    "more formally , two probability distributions for environmental cue may be constructed , the former related to the environment , the latter related to the cell states , respectively .",
    "the next question is , how to measure the distinction between the states that are described only probabilistically .",
    "for that , we apply the term distance in its broad mathematical meaning , as a distance between two probability distributions . in the next , we express the transition matrix in the terms of generalized distances between the probability density functions corresponding to the environment and to the respective state , and between the probability density functions corresponding to the two respective cell states . here",
    "proposed formalism is consistent with the dynamical system conceptualization @xcite , where the cell states were epitomized by the respective attractors distributed around stable states in epigenetic landscape ( see section iii ) .    biological relevance of the formalism results from the flow cytometry experiments , where the phenotypic distributions of cell populations are the typical outputs @xcite .",
    "the distributions are not the artefacts caused by the imperfection of experimental procedures , but they reflect phenotypic gene expression noise @xcite , which is intensively studied authentic biological phenomenon@xcite .",
    "the concept of attractor is , however , not context - free .",
    "therefore , to continue in this conceptualization , we provide more clarity about what we mean when talking about attractors of deterministic systems accepting some degree of indeterminism .",
    "obviously , deterministic and stochastic systems have different properties , and should be treated separately .",
    "so far we have continued without mentioning problem with the stochastic attractor framework originally conceived as deterministic , although attractor is also pertinent to stochastic systems .",
    "our approach avoids purely mathematical concept of pullback attractor and process  @xcite which are actually of little relevance for our work .",
    "instead , we prefer more intuitive picture where small noise perturbations induces random switching between ( stable ) coexisting point attractors of different relative depth .",
    "such scenarios are also conceivable in computational neuroscience in modeling multistable perception  @xcite",
    ". the transitions between attractors can be best characterized by the transition probabilities  @xcite .",
    "our formalism is to substantial extent influenced by the study of developmental transitions  @xcite , where dynamical features of attractors are comprised in the quasi - potentials of specific depth , while the transition probabilities between attractors are defined in analogous way as thermally activated transitions between equilibrium states .    in the next ,",
    "we apply the above considerations to construct phenomenological relation between transition probability and the match of environment and population statistics , both expressed by the probability distribution of the above environmental cue .",
    "our phenomenological model postulates , that transitions are associated with matching conditions of the attractor distributions comprised in @xmath10 where @xmath11 expresses the measure of attractivity of the @xmath5-th attractor under instant environmental factors ; its sign will be discussed later within the relevant biological context .",
    "the amplitude parameter @xmath12 determines relative strength of this environmental influence .",
    "the second term , @xmath13 , manifests dependence of the transition probability on the generalized distance , @xmath14 , between the attractors @xmath5 and @xmath15 .",
    "the distance appears in ( [ squared_dist ] ) in squared form in analogy with the transition term for diffusion of random walk process . in this context @xmath16 parameter",
    "represents reciprocal value of the diffusion coefficient .",
    "the constant @xmath17 simply stems from the normalization condition @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the specific time scale of the transitions .",
    "the parameter is assumed to be much smaller than the evolutionary time scale .",
    "then the normalized form of @xmath20 may be written as @xmath21 suppose , that the probability density function of the environmental cue is parametrized by the single parameter or parameters comprised in @xmath22 .",
    "similarly , the probability density function of the environmental cue associated with the @xmath5-th attractor is parametrized by @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "the impact of the @xmath5-th attractor is proportional to the generalized distance of @xmath23 from the current probability distribution which reflects environmental conditions expressed by @xmath22 . to sum up",
    ", the effect of environment may be quantified by a squared generalized distance @xmath25 , normalized , without the loss of generality , to interval ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath27 .",
    "this tendency is captured by the phenomenological equation @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the amplitude common to all attractors , the sign of which follows from the biological context . in evolutionary biology ,",
    "populations of isogenic individuals evolving in time - varying environments typically develop bet - hedging strategy , which means that the statistics of states is coupled with the statistics of environment @xcite .",
    "to reflect biological relevance , i. e. that more accurate matching of the state statistics with the statistics of environment represents comparative advantage , and , at the same time , to stay consistent with the eq .",
    "( [ squared_dist ] ) , we postulated @xmath29 . within the above biological context",
    ", @xmath23 is assumed to be fixed ( being already evolved ) , while the parameters of the environment statistics comprised in @xmath30 are allowed to vary .",

    ", the parameters comprised in eq .  [ sensing ] may be interpreted as follows .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 expresses dependence of the transition probabilities on instant environment and corresponds to responsive switching , and @xmath16 is related to the probability of stochastic switching .",
    "the constants @xmath32 , @xmath16 stem purely from genetic basis which was fixed during long evolutionary history .",
    "accordingly to the instructive conceptualization  @xcite , each point in the genomic landscape ( i.  e.  genome ) provides epigenetic landscape of unique topology , which , due to its mathematical complexity , contains many stabilizing areas of space ( attractors ) around stable ( or equilibrium ) states .",
    "transitions between attractors dominate in complex system s behavior at its relevant time scales and represent additional force to the component of the force which follows gradient in the ( quasi - potential ) epigenetic landscape  @xcite .",
    "the system may contain countable set of attractors of different types adjoining each other and , intuitively , the probability of transitions between specific states depends on the depth and form of the respective attractors . therefore , to put forward the above outlined conceptualization , the distributions ( which are attractors in the functional space ) must be specified .",
    "the arguments given here may be applied to simple , as well as highly complex parametrization .    below we presume the attractors with normally distributed fluctuations . in such case",
    "we assume @xmath34 , @xmath24 , where @xmath35 denotes the mean of the selected factor and @xmath36 is its dispersion .",
    "analogously , for the environment we assume the parametrization @xmath37 .",
    "dissimilarity between the pairs of normal distributions is characterized by the _ hellinger distance",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "this original forms are modified by the regularization ( see appendix ) . in agreement with",
    "the assumptions and parametrization of the model discussed , we use regularized hellinger distances in two contexts :    \\i ) the inter - attractor form @xmath38    and , ii ) attractor - environment form @xmath39 all the distances are regularized by the unique additive parameter @xmath40 , which plays the role of additional contribution to dispersion or determines respective generalized geometrical context .",
    "the functions are homogeneous of the order zero in the following sense @xmath41 the above equation trivially induces scale invariance of the transition matrix .",
    "the independence on the scaling parameter @xmath42 implies generality of the conclusions derived from the particular calculation , which makes relevant proportions of the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 , and time dependencies @xmath43 and @xmath44 instead of their values themselves .",
    "the idea of regularization is to keep dependence upon the @xmath35 , @xmath45 and @xmath43 even in the anomalous situation when the dispersions vanish @xmath46 the above relationship indicates , that only @xmath40 guarantees sensitivity of the distance to the mean values also in the case of zero dispersions @xmath36 and @xmath47 .",
    "now , instead of interest in particular attractor , we continue with the construction of the probabilistic model for the response probability density function @xmath48 , representing the system of attractors , along some cumulative cell state characteristics @xmath49 , playing formally the role of interpolation variable .",
    "note that @xmath49 is assumed to have the same origin ( i. e. the same meaning , dimension and unit ) as @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "following above conceptualization , we express @xmath50 as a probabilistic multimodal gaussian mixture model @xmath51 based on the convex combination of @xmath52 gaussian response probability density functions @xmath53 in this formula , the previously introduced probabilities @xmath54 play the role of mixture weights . at the level of description",
    "using @xmath48 , passing along the only parameter @xmath49 comprises all the key observable statistical characteristics of the system of attractors , whereas @xmath55 pairs may be viewed as partially hidden .",
    "the reader interested in consistency with the classical view of evolutionary biology may find it interesting , that instant fitness of the genetically identical cell population at given conditions @xmath49 may be constructed as a monotonous function of @xmath56 argument .",

    "we note that the assumption of gaussianity is not an ultimate requirement for the eventual applicability and functionality of the method .",
    "any single peak function that resembles gaussian , such as lorentzian or generalized exponential distributions  @xcite , may be used to specify the behavior in the vicinity of the fixed point attractor to achieve faster convergence or more accurate mixing .",
    "we note that one can not _ a priori _ exclude other shapes for characterizing the complex attractors . despite being chosen mainly because of its simplicity , gaussianity of @xmath62",
    "is not the limiting aspect of this study owing to the remarkable potential of the probability mixture models to display higher - order moments @xmath63 with variable coefficients @xmath64 related to the skewness @xmath65 and kurtosis @xmath66 shape - related measures .",
    "consequently , even fat tails can arise as the side effect of statistical mixing of the distributions .",

    "moreover , alternative and , from the information theoretic perspective , more conventional measures of the system of attractors may be used .",
    "if specificity of attractors ( comprised in @xmath62 ) is not taken into account one may use the classical shannon s definition @xmath67 on the other hand , if one focuses on the stochastic transitions between attractors , then more appropriate measure is markovian chain rates entropy @xmath68 due to complexity of the presented model , temporal behavior of both the entropy measures can only be provided by numerical integration . in the near future it would be also interesting to investigate markovian framework of phenotypic switching regarding non - ergodicity related to the occurrence , non - occurrence or blocking of specific attractors .    despite purely conceptual essence of the presented model , integrating distinguished cancer - relevant features , such as increased heterogeneity , phenotype switching and cell - to - cell variability in the mathematical framework , it can eventually be applied to analyze experimental data as well .",
    "we presume that once the distributions along an appropriately chosen environmental cue and the frequencies of transitions between the respective attractors are known , the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath16 ( eq .
