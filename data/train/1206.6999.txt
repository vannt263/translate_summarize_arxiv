    "the purpose of the present paper is to introduce some new theoretical concepts related to the bell - kochen - specker theory , and to illustrate them on a new example of a _ saturated _ kochen - specker ( ks ) configuration in eight - dimensional space ( the euclidean space of three qubits ) .",
    "the saturated configurations are of special interest due to their symmetry properties .",
    "the present configuration consists of @xmath0 rays and it is the smallest non - trivial _ saturated _ ks configuration known at this moment in dimension @xmath1 .",
    "the ks configurations are sometimes termed `` non - colourable '' @xcite and the terminology associated to them can slightly vary from author to author .",
    "the original construction of s.  kochen and e.  p.  specker can be found in @xcite ( a configuration of @xmath2 rays in three dimensions ) , and a motivation behind their work can be traced back to the results of j.  s.  bell @xcite ( the bell inequalities in quantum mechanics ) .",
    "the ks configurations are of interest for the foundations of quantum mechanics @xcite since they do not refer directly to the concept of _ probability_. an additional reason to study such configurations is due to the links to some issues of quantum gravity @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", they are of interest in the quantum information science ( qis ) .",
    "the literature about qis is quite extensive in our days .",
    "the example of the saturated ks configuration constructed in the present paper ( 64 rays ) is similar to the configurations described , for instance , in @xcite in the sense that the coordinates of the the vectors representing the rays can be chosen to be @xmath3 , @xmath4 , or @xmath5 . in a recent paper @xcite m.  waegell and p.  k.  aravind point out that there exists a rather large class of ks proofs related to the pauli group on @xmath6 qubits .",
    "the configurations of rays underlying such proofs can be described by vectors with coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the imaginary unit .",
    "i observe that the saturated configuration of 64 rays mentioned admits such a proof .",
    "i also compute a _ critical _",
    "subconfiguration @xmath10 in it ( i.e. the ks configuration @xmath11 which can not be made smaller by deleting the rays ) which happens to contain @xmath12 rays ( the same number as in the critical configuration of @xcite , but the configurations are _ not _ isomorphic ) .    in the present paper",
    "i consider _ three _ types of ks configurations : saturated , critical , and _",
    "tropical_. the first two types ( saturated and critical ) have already appeared in the literature @xcite , and the term `` tropical '' is new .",
    "it is a `` critical '' configuration , but in a different sense , which is explained in the next section .",
    "it is being used as an intermediate step to find a `` small '' critical subconfiguration of @xmath13 .",
    "there is a sequence of inclusions : @xmath14 where @xmath13 is a saturated ks configuration ( 64 rays ) , @xmath15 is tropical ( 48 rays ) , and @xmath11 is critical ( 36 rays ) .",
    "the configuration @xmath11 is obtained from @xmath15 by deleting the rays .",
    "small critical ks configurations are more easy to test in experiment ( they must be less expensive ) .",
    "for instance , there exists an example of a ks configuration in four dimensions consisting of just 18 rays @xcite which has been tested experimentally @xcite . the dimension four can be perceived as the dimension of the euclidean space corresponding to a pair of qubits ( @xmath16 ) . in the present paper",
    "the dimension is eight , which is the dimension of a three - qubit system ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "a triple of qubits is a rather special quantum object on its own . to observe the epr - type correlations @xcite one may work with only two qubits , but to observe the _ really _ weird features of quantum theory it is better to have at least three qubits .",
    "a recent experimental realisation of a triple of qubits on a `` single chip '' has been reported in @xcite . in another work ,",
    "it has recently been shown @xcite that a triple of qubits suffices to refute the conjecture of a.  peres about quantum nonlocality and entanglement distillability .",
    "one can observe berry s phase @xcite on a triple of qubits and describe it in terms of quantum groups @xcite .",
    "there exists a non - trivial link between the @xmath18-root system and the theory of three qubits found in @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the rays represented by the roots of an @xmath18-type lie algebra yield an example of a _ saturated _ kochen - specker type configuration and that this fact can be generalised in several different ways .",
    "one can obtain an infinite family of orthoalgebras @xcite starting from the @xmath18-root system which can be of interest in some approaches to quantum gravity . on the other hand one can scale up and deform this example on multiple qubits @xcite , as well as one can consider other root systems @xcite .",
    "the present paper focuses on the case of a three qubit system , although other important ks examples are known in other dimensions @xcite . in the beginning",
    "i introduce several new definitions and then i test them on the saturated configuration @xmath13 ( 64 rays ) mentioned above . the proof that the configuration is of a kochen - specker type",
    "can be given analytically ( see appendix a ) , or checked on a computer .",
    "the supplementary files mentioned in the main text can be found on arxiv or on my personal webpage .",
    "it is worth to draw attention to the concept of an _ entropy _ of a configuration of rays : a kochen - specker colouring corresonds to a zero entropy @xmath19 .",
    "it is possible to consider more general colourings with @xmath20 .",
    "this naturally leads to a _ multicoloured _ generalisation of the kochen - specker theory , which is not immediately visible in other approaches ( ks proofs in terms of operators ) .",
    "i mention a couple of examples related to multi - colourings , but i leave the rest for another paper .",

    "it turns out that this saturated configuration has quite nice properties which can be studied in terms of _ tropical _ subconfigurations introduced in this paper .    in this section",
    "i make some informal remarks about the subject in general .",
    "first of all , it is quite natural to expect that the definition of a kochen - specker ( ks ) colouring ( the latter is a certain function on a configuration with values 0 and 1 ) should have a `` multicoloured '' generalisation .",
    "intuitively , one may think that these colours can be perceived as elements of some finite group or a similar algebraic structure . from the perspective of pure graph theory such",
    "a generalisation is certainly possible .",
    "the problem is that it is not immediately clear how to construct a generalisation which would still be of interest in quantum mechanics , but not just in pure mathematics .",
    "the approach suggested in the present paper is based on the concept of an _ entropy _ of a _ saturated _ configuration .",
    "the important step is the interpretation of a configuration of rays which admits a kochen - specker colouring as a configuration with entropy equal to zero .    at first sight , an extension of a given critical kochen - specker configuration to a saturated",
    "one is not really necessary since it only complicates things , i.e. adds new measuring devices to an experimental set - up as if there is not enough trouble with decoherence of quantum states .",
    "nonetheless a saturated configuration provides a natural environment where a critical configuration `` lives '' .",
    "a saturated kochen - specker configuration is a rather special object with many symmetries and in general one would expect many isomorphic copies of a given critical configuration inside it .",
    "there can be different isomorphism classes of critical configurations .",
    "intuitively , a saturated ks configuration , or its orthogonality graph , is a discrete analogue of the space of pure states of a quantum system .",
    "one can try to mimic quantum mechanics on such finite undirected graphs .",
    "the objects that exist inside a saturated kochen - specker configuration @xmath13 ( e.g. saturated subconfigurations , critical subconfigurations , etc . ) can `` move '' : if we take an automorphism of the orthogonality graph of @xmath13 , then a subgraph in it does not need to stay fixed .",
    "it can be transferred to an isomorphic copy of itself .",
    "a subconfiguration @xmath11 in @xmath13 has a _ signature _ ( the numbers of cliques and anticliques in the orthogonality graph ) .",
    "it is natural to perceive the number of maximal cliques mentioned in the signature as a `` _ _ capacity _ _ '' of the configuration @xmath11 .",
    "intuitively , the higher is the capacity , the higher is the chance that a configuration does not admit a ks colouring .",
    "it is tempting to term the number of elements in @xmath11 as `` _ _ inductivity _ _ '' of the configuration .",
    "a pair of subconfigurations @xmath285 and @xmath286 in @xmath13 can `` interact '' : if the capacity of @xmath285 is @xmath287 , and the capacity of @xmath286 is @xmath288 , then the capacity @xmath75 of @xmath289 is at least @xmath290 , but it can be @xmath291 .",
    "the maximal value of @xmath75 corresponds to a `` resonance effect '' , etc .",
    "the saturated ks configuration of rays @xmath13 constructed in the present paper has @xmath0 elements and it corresponds to a system of three qubits .",
    "it would be of interest to construct a generalisation of this configuration for any number of qubits ( the number @xmath292 suggests that it might be possible ) .",
    "it would also be of interest to count all kinds of generalised ks colourings of @xmath13 corresponding to non - zero entropies .",
