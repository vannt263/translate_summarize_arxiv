    "accurate determinations of metal abundances in planetary nebulae ( pne ) are important for understand the chemical evolution of galaxies and the nucleosynthesis and mixing processes in low- and intermediate - mass stars . a long - standing problem in nebular abundance studies",
    "has been that the heavy - element abundances derived from optical recombination lines ( orls ) are systematically higher than those derived from collisionally excited lines ( cels ; see liu 2001 , 2003 for recent reviews ) . in extreme cases ,",
    "the discrepancies exceed a factor of 10 . given that cel abundances are sensitive to electron temperature and density , knowledge of temperature and density variations is an essential ingredient in understanding the abundance discrepancy problem .",
    "information on temperature and density variations can be obtained by comparing results derived from plasma diagnostics which behave differently as temperature and density vary .",
    "traditionally , nebular electron temperatures and densities are derived from cel ratios .",
    "however , for pne including high - density regions ( @xmath12e@xmath13@xmath14 ) , such as ic  4997 @xcite , mz  3 @xcite and m  2 - 24 @xcite , cels are strongly suppressed by collisional de - excitation , and so depending on their critical densities , they may become unusable in probing such high - density regions . on the other hand ,",
    "hydrogen recombination lines have very high critical densities ( @xmath15@xmath14 ) .",
    "consequently , the hydrogen recombination spectrum provides a powerful tool to probe high - density regions .",
    "comparison of electron temperatures and densities derived from the hydrogen recombination spectrum ( lines plus continuum ) with those derived from cels should enable us to quantify temperature and density variations in nebulae .    by measuring the balmer discontinuity , @xcite determined electron temperatures in 14 pne and found that they are systematically lower than those derived from the [ ] nebular - to - auroral forbidden line ratio .",
    "this can be explained by the presence of large temperature fluctuations since the [ ] @xmath16 auroral line of higher excitation energy tends to be emitted in higher temperature regions than the [ ] @xmath17 nebular lines of lower excitation energy , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "recent reviews on temperature fluctuations of gaseous nebulae are given by @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , no photoionization models yield such large temperature fluctuations suggested by observations . moreover , temperature fluctuations are unable to explain the large disparity between the orl and cel abundances observed in some pne @xcite . instead",
    ", it is found that the hypothesis that pne may contain clumps of different temperature , density and chemical composition , embedded in diffuse ` normal ' material , can explain many of the observed patterns @xcite .",
    "peimbert s concept of temperature fluctuations alone may not be a realistic description of the physical conditions in a nebula , although it has proven to be a convenient and useful way to characterize the complexities of real nebulae .",
    "it is expected that there are also variations of electron density inside a pn .",
    "@xcite pointed out that electron densities derived from various plasma diagnostics should correlate positively with the critical densities of the diagnostic lines involved if there are large density variations within a nebula .",
    "@xcite found that electron densities derived from the [ ] @xmath9 ratios are generally lower than those derived from the optical [ ] and [ ] doublet ratios , suggesting the presence of high density regions in pne , where the 52- and 88-@xmath18 lines are suppressed by collisional de - excitation due to their relatively low critical densities .",
    "@xcite showed that the discrepancies between @xmath0([]@xmath3 ) and @xmath0(bal ) can be explained by the presence of condensations in nebulae and gave an analytical method of estimating the filling factor of condensations .",
    "our detailed studies of the peculiar pne mz  3 and m  2 - 24 suggest that the presence of high - density regions in some pne can significantly affect abundance determinations @xcite .",
    "however , density inhomogeneities alone can not explain the large disparity between the orl and cel abundances either , unless the condensations are also h - deficient @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that the discrepancy between the orl and cel abundances correlates with the difference between the temperatures derived from the [ ] collisional lines and from the balmer jump of hydrogen recombination spectrum , thus lending strong support to the argument that some extremely cold h - deficient knots may co - exist with normal nebular material in many pne .",
    "however , it is difficult to explain the origin and evolution of such h - deficient knots with the current theories of element production in intermediate - mass stars .    in this paper",
    ", we present determinations of electron temperatures and densities for a large sample of pne based on the analysis of nebular hydrogen recombination spectrum .",
    "section 2 describes the sample . in section 3 , we describe a new approach to deriving electron temperature and density simultaneously from the observed nebular hydrogen recombination spectrum ( lines plus continuum ) and present the results . in section 4 , we compare results derived from a variety of temperature and density indicators and discuss the significance of variations in electron temperature and density in pne .",
    "a discussion of he / h abundance determinations is also presented in this section . in section 5 , we present electron temperatures and densities derived from the paschen discontinuity and decrements .",
    "a summary then follows in section 6 .",

    "for example , high density regions have been detected in m  2 - 24 and ic  4997 @xcite .",

    "the recombination spectrum consists of continuum and line emission .",
    "the continuous spectrum has a jump at the limit of the balmer series at 3646 .",
    "high - order balmer lines ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) converge at the balmer discontinuity and merge with the continuum jump at shorter wavelength .",
    "the size of the balmer jump is a function of electron temperature . on the other hand ,",
    "intensities of high - order balmer lines ( @xmath46 , @xmath48 ) relative to h@xmath24 are sensitive to electron density .",
    "therefore , the hydrogen recombination spectrum near the balmer jump region provides valuable temperature and density diagnostics .",
    "our method and results of the electron temperature and density determinations based on this technique are presented below .",
    "several processes contribute to the continuum emission from a nebula : free - free and free - bound emission and the two - photon decay .",
    "apart from hydrogen , the second most abundant element , helium also contributes significantly to the first two processes .",
    "in addition , emission from the central star and local dust can in principle contaminate the observed continuum spectrum . in the following",
    ", a detailed calculation including all the processes is presented .",
    "the free - free ( or bremsstrahlung ) emission , which is emitted when an free electron interacts but does not combine with a positively charged ion such as h@xmath31 , he@xmath31 and he@xmath32 , dominates the nebular continuum in the infrared and radio region .",
    "the emission coefficient of this process is given by @xcite , @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 and @xmath51 are ion and electron densities respectively , @xmath52 is the nuclear charge , @xmath53 is the electron temperature , @xmath54 denotes the rydberg energy and @xmath55 is the free - free gaunt factor . here",
    "@xmath55 is computed using the method outlined by @xcite .    in the optical region ,",
    "free - bound emission is the main contributor to the continuum . according to @xcite ,",
    "the emission coefficient of continuous emission due to recombinations of h@xmath31 , he@xmath31 or he@xmath32 with electrons is @xmath56,\\ ] ] where @xmath57 is the ionization potential of the ( @xmath58,@xmath59 ) state , @xmath60 is the lowest state that can contribute to the free - bound emission at the given frequency @xmath61 and @xmath62 is the photoionization cross - section for the state , which is computed using the method described by @xcite .",
    "another important source of continuous emission is two - photon decay of the 2@xmath63 level of the hydrogen atom ( two - photon emission from he@xmath31 and he@xmath64 is negligible for nebulae of cosmic compositions ; brown @xmath65 mathews , 1970 ) .",
    "single photon transition from the 2@xmath63 level to the ground 1@xmath63 is forbidden .",
    "radiative decay of the 2@xmath63 level to the ground can only occur via two photon emission , in which the electron jumps to a virtual level , which can lie in anywhere between @xmath66 and @xmath67 levels , and then to the ground state , emitting two photons in the process .",
    "as a result , continuum emission longward of ly@xmath26 will occur .",
    "the emission coefficient of the two - photon process is given by @xmath68,\\ ] ] where @xmath69 and @xmath70 is the probability per second for emitting a photon in the interval d@xmath71 . approximately , the function @xmath72 is given by the following expression @xmath73^{0.8}\\}+0.88[y(1-y)]^{1.53}[4y(1-y)]^{0.8}\\ } { \\rm s}^{-1}\\ ] ] @xcite .",
    "the transition probability for the two - photon decay is @xmath74  s@xmath21 .",
    "the equilibrium population of the 2@xmath63 state is given by @xmath75 @xcite , where @xmath76 is the proton density , @xmath77 is the effective recombination coefficient for populating 2@xmath63 , and @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the collisional de - excitation transition rates of 2@xmath63 to 2@xmath80 states by electrons and protons , respectively .",
    "note that the collisional transition from 2@xmath80 to 2@xmath63 has been ignored in equation ( 6 ) . under case a conditions , this is a good approximation .",
    "under case b conditions , however , the population of the 2@xmath80 state is comparable to that of the metastable 2@xmath63 level since ly@xmath26 is trapped between the 2@xmath80 and 1@xmath63 states .",
    "consequently , there is considerable collisional excitation from 2@xmath80 to 2@xmath63 , which enhances the two - photon emission .",
    "therefore , the emission coefficient of two - photon process given by equation ( 4 ) can be significantly underestimated .",
    "however , this hardly affects our resultant electron temperatures and densities since an additional continuum ( see below ) , is added to fit our observed spectrum in order to simulate direct and scattered stellar light . for a limited wavelength region , such an approach is sufficient to account for any excess emission from the two - photon process .",
    "finally , direct or scattered light from the central star can contaminate the observed continuum level . for our observations ,",
    "the slit position was normally chosen to sample the brightest parts of the nebulae , sometimes passing through the central star .",
    "some spectra were derived by scanning across the nebular surface .",
    "it is quite difficult to evaluate the level and spectral energy distribution of the contaminating stellar continuum .",
    "as central stars of pne are relatively hot ( @xmath8120,000k ) , in our calculation , a rayleigh - jeans approximation for a black body ( @xmath82 ) is adopted to simulate the stellar continuum .",
    "this stellar component also partially compensates for the underestimated two - photon continuum , as mentioned above . for simplicity",
    ", we shall call this term ` stellar continuum ' hereafter .",
    "continuum emission from dust grains peaks in the infrared and is negligible in the optical region .",
    "thus it has been neglected in our calculation .",
    "apart from continuum emission , recombination line emission from bound - bound transitions of h@xmath64 , he@xmath64 and he@xmath31 is also included .",
    "the emission coefficient of a recombination line is given by @xmath83,\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the effective recombination coefficient of the line .",
    "for and recombination lines , emission coefficients are determined as in @xcite . here",
    "the considered maximum principle quantum number of is @xmath85 . for recombination lines ,",
    "emission coefficients are taken from @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the slope of the feature is sensitive to electron density , and thus provide an excellent density diagnostic .",
    "the region is contaminated by the @xmath933664 line of multiplet v  1 .",
    "however , the weak recombination line has a relatively narrow line width compared to the profile of the continuum - like feature and consequently , can not cause any difficulty in our analysis .",
    "summing up contributions from all the processes discussed above , the flux at a given wavelength is given by @xmath94~[{\\rm erg~cm}^{-3}~{\\rm s}^{-1}~{\\rm \\aa}^{-1}].\\ ] ]    equation ( 11 ) shows that , in order to synthesize the nebular spectrum near the balmer jump wavelength region , the required input parameters include nebular electron temperature and density , the magnitude of contaminating stellar continuum , he@xmath31/h@xmath31 and he@xmath32/h@xmath31 ionic abundance ratios and @xmath95 . in general , decreasing ( increasing ) of the nebular electron temperature will steepen ( flatten ) the general shape of the theoretical continuum and increase ( decrease ) the balmer discontinuities ; decreasing ( increasing ) of electron density will steepen ( flatten ) the continuous feature redwards of 3646   and decrease ( increase ) the intensities of high - order balmer lines relative to a low - order line , such as h@xmath24 , as shown in fig .  [ trend ] .",
    "accordingly , matching the dereddened observed spectrum to those calculated from equation ( 11 ) by varying the electron temperature and density , we can determine the electron temperature and density simultaneously provided other parameters , such as he@xmath31/h@xmath31 and he@xmath32/h@xmath31 abundance ratios and @xmath95 are known .",
    "electron temperatures and densities for 48 pne are derived by fitting the synthetic to the observed spectra . for synthesis , the required he@xmath31/h@xmath31 and he@xmath32/h@xmath31 abundance ratios",

    "three free parameters , nebular electron temperature and density and the fraction of the scattered rayleigh - jeans stellar continuum , are optimized simultaneously , using least chi square method to match the observed spectra . for the optimization ,",
    "the fitted data points were specified explicitly by eye , within the wavelength range from 35503850 , but excluding regions of strong ( forbidden ) lines .",
    "the results are partially shown in fig .  [ all ] together with the residuals of the fits .    in table",
    "[ tbl-2 ] , we report the derived electron temperatures and densities along with their estimated errors . the balmer jump and decrement of the recombination spectrum have previously been used to determine nebular electron temperatures and densities in four pne , m  2 - 24 @xcite , ngc  6153 @xcite , m  1 - 42 and m  2 - 36 @xcite . for the four pne ,",
    "the results derived here are in good agreement with the earlier results within the errors .",
    "the errors caused by uncertainties in the input parameters he@xmath31/h@xmath31 and he@xmath32/h@xmath31 abundance ratios are negligible due to the small measurement errors of strong and lines and their small contribution to the continuum emission compared to hydrogen ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "errors in @xmath95 can also be ignored as this quantity is well determined by fitting strong hydrogen lines .",
    "the complicated velocity fields within a nebula can cause different lines to have different deviations from their laboratory wavelengths , and thus can affect the quality of line - fitting made under the simple assumption of a uniform velocity for all ions and lines .",
    "line - fitting can also be affected by blends of unknown lines and deviations of line profiles from gaussian .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "[ all ] shows that the observed intensities of the 2s@xmath97s@xmath98p@xmath97p@xmath99 @xmath100 lines are generally lower than its predicted values .",
    "@xcite attributed this to the destruction of lyman photons by photoionization of h@xmath64 or by absorption of dust grains .",
    "the wavelength region near the balmer jump also contains a few strong bowen fluorescence lines which are not considered in our simulations , thus giving large residuals at the corresponding wavelengths .",
    "however , these effects do not contribute to errors in the derived electron temperatures and densities since these wavelengths have been excluded in the fitting .    the observed spectra plotted in fig .",
    "[ all ] , were de - reddened using extinction constants listed in table  [ tbl-1 ] .",
    "all spectra were normalized to h  11 @xmath101 in order to minimize errors in derived temperatures and densities caused by uncertainties in the reddening correction and flux calibration , and taking the advantage of the small wavelength difference between the balmer jump and h  11 .",
    "the stellar continuum may have a spectral energy distribution that deviates from the rayleigh - jeans approximation adopted here .",
    "however , this continuum is expected to be smooth and vary only slightly over such a short wavelength range of fitting . therefore , we have also ignored any possible errors caused by the fitting of the stellar continuum .",
    "errors in the derived temperatures and densities are dominated by two effects .",
    "noise is an important source of error . for most pne",
    ", we found that uncertainties due to this factor are about 5@xmath102 in the derived temperatures and 0.1 dex in the densities .",
    "the other major error source originates from the extensive wings of the strong [ ] @xmath103 3726 , 3729 lines , which can affect the shape of the continuum near the balmer jump . the effect is larger for low - excitation pne , such as ngc  40 and ngc  6720 .",
    "the extensive wings of the [ ] lines can cause the continuum redwards of the balmer jump to be overestimated . as a result",
    ", the temperatures can be overestimated .",
    "the errors can be reduced by including data points at longer wavelengths in the fitting , where the extensive wings of the [ ] lines have less impact . however , increasing the wavelength range of the fitting would increase uncertainties in the reddening correction and in fitting the stellar continuum . to evaluate errors due to this effect , each spectrum was fitted twice for two wavelength ranges with one extending further into the red than the other .",
    "the extensive wings of the [ ] lines can also decrease the shape of the continuum - like feature redwards of the balmer jump , leading to overestimated densities . for most",
    "pne , this effect is negligible given the large wavelength difference ( about 70   ) between the balmer jump and the moderate strength of [ ] lines .",
    "however , the effect can be significant for those with extremely strong [ ] lines .",
    "on the other hand , the extensive wings of the [ ] lines have much less effect on the integrated intensities of high - order balmer lines ( @xmath46 , @xmath104 ) which can be determined using a line profile fitting technique .",
    "comparison of densities derived from the continuum - like feature redwards of the balmer jump with those deduced from the integrated intensities of high - order balmer lines ( e.g. liu et al .",
    "2001b ) allows us to estimate the errors in the derived densities caused by the extensive wings of the [ ] lines .",
    "the final errors given in table  [ tbl-2 ] were based on estimates of contributions from the two dominating sources of uncertainty discussed above .",

    "two extreme cases are ic  4997 and m  2 - 24 . for ic  3568 , [ ] @xmath41 yields an abnormally low density .",
    "the cause of it is unclear but is probably due to measurement error . in fig .",

    "in fact , it has been found that the far - ir lines yield systematic lower densities , lower than even those deduced from optical forbidden line density - diagnostics @xcite .",
    "a linear fit shows that the density discrepancy increases with the electron density .",

    "the hydrogen recombination spectrum arises from the entire ionized nebula .",
    "thus the discrepancies between densities derived from recombination spectrum and those deduced from forbidden line ratios are not likely to be caused by ionization stratifications .",
    "we notice that the [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] and [ ] density - diagnostic lines have critical densities of @xmath107  @xmath14 .",
    "therefore , if the nebulae contain regions of higher densities , these forbidden lines will be suppressed in these regions by collisional de - excitation .",
    "in contrast , the hydrogen recombination spectrum is practically unaffected by collisional de - excitation . as a result , in such cases the hydrogen recombination spectrum will yield higher average densities compared to the [ ] , [ ] , [ ] , [ ] and [ ] lines ratios .",
