    "nuclear reactors emit a calculable flux of electron antineutrinos ( @xmath5s ) in all directions . for standard particle propagation ,",
    "one expects a detector located a distance @xmath6 from the reactor to measure a flux that decreases as @xmath7 .",
    "but if @xmath5s are massive , they may `` oscillate '' into undetectable flavors on the way to the detector , leading to an apparent `` disappearance '' of the @xmath5s .",
    "neutrinos are produced and detected in weak interactions , which couple to the weak eigenstates @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . for massive neutrinos",
    ", the weak eigenstates may be expressed as a linear combination of three mass eigenstates @xmath10 , @xmath11 , with mass @xmath12 : @xmath13 @xmath14 is a @xmath15 unitary `` mixing '' matrix and is analogous to the ckm matrix in the quark sector . as a neutrino propagates through vacuum with momentum @xmath16 , the phase of each mass eigenstate will change at different rates according to @xmath17 where @xmath18 . at times",
    "@xmath19 the neutrino will be in a superposition of the weak eigenstates .",
    "the probability of detecting flavor @xmath20 at a distance @xmath21 from the source is then @xmath22    in neutrino oscillation experiments , it is common to simplify to two neutrino flavors , say @xmath23 and @xmath24 , in which case @xmath14 is parameterized by a single mixing angle @xmath25 . in this picture , the probability of a neutrino emitted as @xmath23 to be detected as @xmath23 is then @xmath26 where @xmath27 . here",
    ", @xmath28 is taken to be the mass - squared difference between two `` effective '' mass eigenstates relevant to @xmath29 mixing .",
    "note that @xmath30 is a sinusoidal function of l , hence the name `` neutrino oscillation '' .",
    "the situation becomes slightly more complicated for neutrinos propagating through matter . as first recognized by wolfenstein@xcite , mikheyev , and smirnov@xcite ,",
    "while all three weak states participate in neutral - current interactions with normal matter , only electron neutrinos have additional charge - current interactions with electrons in the material being traversed .",
    "this results in an effective index - of - refraction for @xmath23 different from that for @xmath31 by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number - density of electrons in the material , and @xmath34 is the forward scattering amplitude .",
    "@xmath35 changes the phase of the @xmath23-component relative to the other components by @xmath36 over a distance @xmath37 given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the fermi constant .",
    "this phenomenon , called the msw effect , alters the two flavor oscillation probability as follows : @xmath40    @xmath41    @xmath42^{- \\frac{1}{2 } } \\label{emsw3}\\ ] ]    for neutrinos created in and propagating out of the sun , @xmath43 km @xmath44 , and matter effects are significant .",
    "the result is that @xmath23 disappearance experiments that use the sun as a source , such as homestake@xcite , gallex@xcite , sage@xcite , kamiokande@xcite , super - kamiokande@xcite , and sno@xcite , individually allow values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 over many orders of magnitude .",
    "the overlap of allowed regions from multiple experiments with different thresholds leaves a few small patches , with values around @xmath47 and @xmath48 ev@xmath3 highly favored .",
    "this region is called the `` large mixing angle '' ( lma ) msw solution . prior to kamland , another patch at lower @xmath49 ev@xmath3 , known as the `` low '' msw solution , survived at the 99.73% c.l.@xcite    for neutrino experiments with artificial sources on the earth , matter effects are typically much less significant .",
    "this is because for matter with density similar to rock @xmath50 km , larger than the radius of the earth .",
    "thus for these sources the modifications to the oscillation parameters can be viewed as perturbations on the vacuum parameters , and for short enough oscillation lengths can be neglected .",
    "artificial @xmath51 sources for oscillation experiments typically take one of two forms : neutrino beams or nuclear reactors .",
    "these two sources comprise a highly complementary experimental program in neutrino oscillation .",
    "neutrino beams in general require very long baselines for good @xmath46 sensitivity , but the collimation of these sources lessens the severity of this obstacle considerably .",
    "moreover , beams produce higher energy neutrinos and multiple flavors , allowing for not only disappearance but also appearance measurements . reactors , on the other hand , are a non - collimated source , and produce exclusively electron ( anti)neutrinos , restricting the experimenter to disappearance - only measurements and thus giving limited sensitivity to @xmath52 . however , due to the lower energies of the neutrinos ( 1 - 10 mev ) , reactor experiments are sensitive to very small @xmath46 .",
    "note that both neutrino beams and reactors are `` laboratory - style '' experiment , in which both the source and the detector are controlled .",
    "the physics of neutrino propagation can then be cleanly tested separately from the mechanisms involved in the production of the neutrinos .",
    "more than 99.9% of @xmath5s emitted by nuclear reactors are produced in the decay chains of the fission products of only four isotopes : @xmath53u , @xmath54u , @xmath55pu , and @xmath56pu .",
    "the number of fissions of each of these isotopes over the data - taking period is estimated from a monte carlo simulation of the reactor core that tracks fuel burn - up and u / pu production over reactor fuel cycles .",
    "the performance of such simulations has been verified by comparing the simulated fuel composition at the end of a fuel cycle with measurements of isotopic abundances in the actual spent fuel rods .",
    "the inputs to the simulation include the initial fuel composition and periodic measurements of the secondary calorimetric power , the pressure and flow rate in the primary cooling system , and various other operational parameters . however , the results of the simulations depend very weakly on most of the inputs .",
    "accuracy is required only for the fuel composition and the power , on which the fission rates depend linearly .",
    "the power is measured rather precisely : reactors are regulated to operate at about a standard deviation or so below their rated power outputs . the economic incentive to produce as much power as possible pushes this error to be small ; uncertainties @xmath57 are common .",
    "the emitted @xmath5 spectrum is then calculated by summing the spectrum emitted by each isotope weighted by the number of fissions of that isotope during the data taking period . for @xmath53u , @xmath55pu , and @xmath56pu , @xmath5 spectra",
    "are derived from @xmath58-spectra measurements.@xcite@xmath59@xcite extracting the @xmath5 spectra from the @xmath58-spectra is non - trivial ; it involves complex bookkeeping of the decay chains for each daughter nucleus and summing the contributions .",
    "the spectra are normalized to the number of @xmath5s emitted per fission , and have uncertainties of a few percent . for @xmath54u ,",
    "no measurements are available , so we must rely on a calculation@xcite of the @xmath5 spectrum .",
    "the uncertainty in the calculation is @xmath6010% , but since fissions from @xmath54u make up only @xmath6010% of the signal , this results in a 1% uncertainty in the full @xmath5 flux .",
    "reactor experiments typically detect @xmath5s via inverse-@xmath58-decay , @xmath61 , because the 2-particle final state distinguishes the @xmath5 from most other particles and dramatically reduces backgrounds .",
    "the positron carries away almost all of the energy of the incident neutrino , so that the detected positron spectrum is to a good approximation the incident neutrino spectrum folded with the detection cross section and shifted by a constant energy .",
    "the cross section has a threshold of 1.8 mev , and has been calculated@xcite with uncertainties on the level of a percent .",
    "the most recent generation of reactor experiments , palo verde@xcite and chooz@xcite , showed that uncertainties on the level of a few percent can be achieved for these calculations .",
    "the fact that @xmath5 disappearance has not been detected in reactor experiments with baselines up to @xmath601 km@xcite@xmath62@xcite allows one to view these experiments as a verification the reactor flux calculations to within a few percent over most of reactor neutrino spectrum .",
    "kamland uses the entire japanese nuclear power industry as a 180 gw@xmath63 long - baseline source .",
    "the experiment is located underneath mt .",
    "ikenoyama in gifu prefecture in central japan .",
    "80% of the @xmath5 flux comes from reactors at baselines of 140 - 210 km .",
    "this range of baselines makes kamland particularly sensitive to values of @xmath46 corresponding to the lma msw solution to the solar neutrino problem .",
    "matter effects in rock can be neglected at this distance scale .",
    "the results presented here are for 145.1 live - days of data taking between march and september 2002 .",
    "calculating the incident flux at kamland during this period requires summing the flux from every reactor in japan .",
    "reactor data , including instantaneous power and fuel burn - up , is provided by the japanese power companies .",
    "the flux from reactors in korea and the rest of the world is estimated from reported power generation , and makes up only a few percent of the overall flux .",
    "as stated earlier , kamland detects @xmath5s via inverse-@xmath58-decay , @xmath61 , with the energy of the positron @xmath64 related to the energy of the incident @xmath5 by essentially a constant offset of 1.8 mev .",
    "the positron quickly deposits this energy in kamland s liquid scintillator before annihilating with an electron , giving a prompt energy deposit of @xmath65 mev",
    ". meanwhile , the neutron thermalizes and eventually captures on a proton , releasing a 2.2 mev gamma in the process .",
    "the characteristic capture time of @xmath60 210 @xmath66s between the prompt and delayed events provides a powerful background reduction .",
    "kamland s liquid scintillator is composed of 80% dodecane , 20% pseudocumene , and 1.52 g / liter of ppo .",
    "one kton of scintillator is held inside a 6.5 m radius transparent balloon made of a 135 @xmath66 m thick sandwich of nylon and ethylene vinyl alcohol copolymer films .",
    "1879 17- and 20-inch photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) mounted on the inner surface of an 18 m stainless steel sphere view events inside the scintillator .",
    "for the results reported here , only the 1325 17-inch tubes are used , corresponding to 22% coverage .",
    "a buffer of mineral oil between the pmts and the balloon provide buoyancy for the balloon and shielding from radioactivity in the pmt glass .",
    "outside the steel sphere is a water cherenkov outer detector ( od ) serving as a muon veto .",
    "a chimney and deck at the top of the detector provide access for calibration devices to be deployed along the z - axis .",

    "is then opened for 1 ms with a lower threshold of 120 tubes .",
    "the pulses are digitized by analog transient waveform digitizers ( atwds ) .",
    "there are two atwds per pmt to reduce dead time during digitization .",
    "the visible energy and position of each event is reconstructed from the collected charge and the hit pattern .",
    "the reconstruction algorithms are developed and tested using uniformly distributed spallation products following muons and using calibration data along the z - axis with @xmath67ge , @xmath68co , and @xmath69zn gamma sources , and an ambe neutron / gamma source .",
    "the calibration data are also used to estimate the conversion from visible energy to kinematic energy , taking into account particle - dependent non - linear effects due to quenching and cherenkov light production .",
