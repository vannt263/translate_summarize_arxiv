    "in the past 20 years , observations from space - based telescopes revealed that the solar corona and transition region are much more dynamic than had been thought .",
    "surges , jets , macrospicules , bright points and macroflares take place everywhere in the solar atmosphere .",
    "sometimes , surges , jets and macrospicules exhibit rotating motions , which is suggested to be an indicator of the existence of alfvn waves in these structures ( sterling , 1998 ) .",
    "the mechanism providing such a highly dynamic corona and transition region is considered to be related to the long - standing puzzle of how the corona is heated to a million kelvin @xcite .",
    "rotational motions in the photosphere ( brandt et al 1988 ) may create rotating motions of surges ( jets ) and macrospicules which are driven by localized downdrafts that collect the cold plasma returning to the solar interior after releasing internal energy ( e.g. , spruit et al . 1990 ; stein & nordlund 1998 ) .",
    "usually those vortices are small ( 0.5 mm ) and last several minutes , but sometimes they could be large and survive much longer ( see , e.g. attie et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the quiet sun , about 3.1@xmath010@xmath2 vortices mm@xmath3",
    "minute@xmath4 are found @xcite , and they do not have a preferred rotation sense on the different hemispheres ( bonet et al .",
    "the vortices on the photosphere can propagate upward along the field lines ( e.g. , choudhuri et al .",
    "1993 ; zirker 1993 ; van ballegooijen et al . 1998 ) , and govern the evolution of magnetic footpoints @xcite . in the low chromosphere ,",
    "vortical motions with possible propagation of waves were also detected for the first time by wedemeyer - bhm & rouppe van der voort ( 2009 ) .",
    "moreover , they often wind up opposite polarity field lines , facilitating magnetic reconnection and ensuing energy release . for active regions ,",
    "rotating motion is one of the most important processes for sunspot evolution , and may be responsible for the flaring @xcite . thus those rotating motions may provide a mechanism to build up the magnetic energy in the corona that is eventually released during transients , which in turn heats the corona .",
    "in this letter , we report the discovery of euv cyclones and rotating network magnetic fields ( rnfs ) in the quiet sun with the observations from the atmospheric imaging assembly ( aia ; lemen et al .",
    "2011 ) and the helioseismic and magnetic imager ( hmi ; wachter et al .",
    "2011 ) aboard the _ solar dynamics observatory _ ( sdo ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follow . in section 2",
    "we describe the observational data we use .",
    "an analysis of the data is presented in section 3 . in section 4",
    ", we conclude this study and discuss the results .",
    "sdo / aia observes uninterruptedly the sun s full disk at 10 wavelengths at a 12-second cadence and a 0.6@xmath5 pixel@xmath4 sampling .",
    "the measurements reflect various temperatures of the solar atmosphere ( from @xmath65000 k to @xmath62.5 mk ) from the photosphere to the corona .",
    "sdo / hmi , from polarization measurements , information such as doppler - velocity , line - of - sight ( los ) magnetic field strength , and vectorial information of the magnetic field are obtained .",
    "the data cover the full disk of the sun with a spatial sampling of 0.5 @xmath5 pixel@xmath4 .",
    "the full disk los magnetograms , used in this letter , are taken at a cadence of 45 seconds .",
    "the phenomenon of the euv cyclones is seen everywhere in the quiet sun in the aia data in all euv channels of 171 , 193 , 304 , 211 , 131 , 335 , and 94  .",
    "those cyclones are found to be associated with the magnetic fields that show conspicuous rotation when viewed with the movies of the hmi time - series magnetograms .",
    "we use the term rnfs to refer to those rotating magnetic fields . here",
    "we present two examples of the euv cyclones to demonstrate their evolutionary characteristics and properties . shown in figures .",
    "1(a ) and 1(b ) is a cyclone occurred on july 2 ( see also movie1 ) .",
    "the images were taken in the 171  channel .",
    "this cyclone was in the northern hemisphere , close to the solar equator .",
    "it started at @xmath62:00 ut , rotated counter - clockwisely , and lasted 12 hours .",
    "the footpoint of the cyclone on the photosphere , shown as a positive field patch in the hmi los magnetograms ( the white feature in figures .",
    "1(c ) and 1(d ) ) , also rotated counter - clockwisely . at 04:02:48 ut ,",
    "the magnetic flux in this patch was 2.9@xmath010@xmath7 mx , one order greater than the flux in a typical network element(@xmath610@xmath8 mx , zhang et al .",
    "2006 ) . the noise level of hmi 45 s magnetograms is 10.2 mx cm@xmath3 ( liu et al .",
    "2011 ) , and the minimum flux obtained for this level in hmi is 1.3 @xmath0 10@xmath10 mx .",
    "its longer axis was along the northeast - southwest direction . at 06:44:48 ut",
    ", this axis rotated to southeast - northwest direction .",
    "it suggests that the magnetic field rotated 64@xmath11 within 162 minutes .",
    "the other example was in the southern hemisphere on july 20 .",
    "it occurred at 07:00 ut , and lasted 9 hours .",
    "2 ( a ) and ( b ) show the cyclone at the 171  images .",
    "the two circles denote the place where a time - slice map is made .",
    "different from the cyclone on july 2 , this cyclone rotated clockwisely ( see movie2 ) . from 11:23:48 ut to 13:20:48 ut , the positive magnetic fields ( black contours in figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) , which the cyclone are rooted in , rotated 83@xmath11 clockwisely ( see ( c ) and ( d ) in figure 2 ) with a speed of 0.8@xmath11 min@xmath4 .",
    "its flux is about 1.6@xmath010@xmath7 mx and then it cancelled with the nearby negative elements ( white contours in figures 2(c ) and 2(d ) ) .",
    "we find that the negative polarity with an absolute magnetic flux of 3.6@xmath010@xmath8 mx disappeared and the positive polarity faded about 3.9@xmath010@xmath8 mx during the cancellation .",
    "the blue curve in panel ( d ) is the contour of euv brightening in panel ( b ) .",
    "we can see that the brightening corresponds to the neutral region , instead to the positive polarity .",
    "figure 2 ( e ) shows a time - slice map of the aia 171  images .",
    "the x - axis refers to time , running from 2010 july 20 11:00 ut to 15:00 ut .",
    "the y - axis refers to the angle subtended by the dotted curves measured clockwise , whose origin is the center of the circle and the reference direction is the west , as shown in panel ( a ) .",
    "the dashed curve outlines the intersection of the leading boundary of the cyclone . in the 3-hour time interval ( from 11:00 ut to 14:00 ut ) , the cyclone rotated about 360@xmath11 . in the later phase of the cyclone at 14:26:59 ut",
    ", an euv brightening appeared .",
    "this brightening continuously developed , exhibiting subtle structures , and becoming a two - ribbon microflare ( the white patches in figure 3 ) .",
    "it lasted 2 hours , and disappeared at 16:18:11 ut .",
    "meanwhile a small - scale wave was triggered by the microflare .",
    "it propagated with an average speed of 45 km s@xmath4 , and lasted almost 8 minutes .",
    "its disturbance spread over an area of 6.3@xmath010@xmath12 km@xmath13 , equivalent to a typical supergranular cell .",
    "figure 4(a ) shows the angular speed of the cyclone measured from the time - slice map .",
    "it indicates that the cyclone underwent two acceleration processes . at",
    "first the cyclone rotated with an angular speed of 1@xmath11 min@xmath4 , 50 minutes later the speed reached 7@xmath11 min@xmath4 , and then slowed down to 1@xmath11 min@xmath4 again . at 13:20 ut , the cyclone accelerated again .",
    "the speed reached another peak ( 4.8@xmath11 min@xmath4 ) .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows the propagating speed of the euv wave .",
    "we determine the wave front ( denoted by stars in each panel in figure 3 ) every 36-second , and then compute the mean speed in the 36-second period .",
    "the propagation speed of the wave was not constant .",
    "there were two peaks , ( @xmath680 km s@xmath4 at 16:00:06 ut , and 85 km s@xmath4 at 16:05:30 ut ) .",
    "observations have shown that euv cyclones are rooted in the rnfs .",
    "an interesting question is then : how many rnfs are there on the solar surface ? to answer this question , we surveyed the 2010 july 8 aia / hmi data when no active region was present on the solar disk . in an area of 800@xmath0980 square arcseconds near the disk center , we found 388 rnfs ( movie3 shows an example of the rnfs ) .",
    "the occurrence of these events is 4.9 @xmath0 10@xmath14 arcsec@xmath3 day@xmath4 .",
    "the average lifetime of the rnfs is about 3.5 h. the distribution of these rnfs is plotted in figure 5 .",
    "their magnetic fluxes range from 1.24@xmath010@xmath15 mx to 5.85@xmath010@xmath7 mx .",
    "the average flux is 1.03@xmath010@xmath7 mx , and the total flux of these rnfs is about 4.0@xmath010@xmath1 mx , or 78% of the unsigned magnetic flux in that area .",
    "there are 179 and 209 rnfs in the northern and southern hemispheres , respectively .",
    "the sense of the rotation shows a weak hemisphere preference : 61% of the rnfs in the northern hemisphere ( 109 of the 179 rnfs ) rotated counter - clockwisely , while 56% of the rnfs in the northern hemisphere ( 116 of 209 rnfs ) rotated clockwisely .",
    "it leads to 5600 rnfs over the entire solar surface each day .",
    "it infers that a total flux of 5.8@xmath010@xmath16 mx is rotating .",
    "simultaneous aia observations show that among the cyclones relevant to these rnfs , 231 ones ( @xmath660% of the total ) are associated with microflares .",
    "in this letter we report the discovery of euv cyclones in the quiet sun .",
    "they are rooted in the rnfs , and last several to more than ten hours , evidently different from surges ( jets ) and macrospicules , which have lifetimes less than one hour @xcite .",
    "about 60% euv cyclones are associated with microflares and even small - scale euv waves at the later phase of cyclones .",
    "the microflares correspond to the neutral region , instead to one polarity .",
    "hmi observations show the ubiquitous presence of the rnfs .",
    "the sense of rotation shows a weak hemisphere preference , which is also presented with g - band observations in vargas domnguez et al .",
    "the average magnetic flux is 1.03@xmath010@xmath7 mx .",
    "every day , we infer that about 5600 rnfs are present over the entire solar surface .",
    "the total unsigned flux is about 5.8@xmath010@xmath16 mx .    as revealed in this study",
    ", the brightenings ( microflares ) are not corresponding to one polarity but to the neutral place where the opposite polarities cancelled .",
    "this is consistent with the morphological model shown in figure 8 of zhang et al .",
    "( 2000b ) . ,",
    "i.e , when two network elements with opposite polarities converge together and begin to cancel each other , a microflare appears at the cancelling site .",
    "surface motion on the photosphere is one of the two mechanisms proposed to build up the free energy in the corona ( the other is the emergence of magnetic field )",
    ". it can produce current sheets parallel to a separatrix that detach the interacting magnetic flux regions ( sweet 1969 ; lau 1993 ; see somov 2006 for a review ) . in the simulation of gerrard",
    "et al . ( 2003 ) , rotation of a sunspot with inflow of a pore leads to a strong build - up of current which is needed for magnetic reconnection .",
    "this current buildup is quite similar to the conclusion of @xcite , i.e. , the rotational motions of sunspots relate to the transport of magnetic energy and complexity from the low atmosphere to the corona and play a key role in the onset of flares . in the quiet sun ,",
    "the random walk of the footpoints of coronal loops in the solar granulation is expected to cause the braiding of the field , which in turn leads to a multitude of coronal reconnection events ( schrijver 2007 ) .",
    "magnetic reconnection between sheared magnetic loops , indicating the injection of magnetic helicity of mixed signs , works as a trigger mechanism of solar flares @xcite .",
    "thus , the phenomena of rnfs , as well as the euv cyclones , reported in this letter , likely contain the process of energy buildup and release in solar corona .",
    "what heats the solar corona remains one of the most important questions in solar physics and astrophysics .",
    "@xcite has proposed that three parts are involved to solve the coronal heating puzzle , which are ( 1 ) identifying a source of energy and a mechanism for converting the magnetic energy into heat , ( 2 ) determining how the plasma responds to the heating , and ( 3 ) predicting the spectrum of emitted radiation and its manifestation as observable quantities .",
    "our results may provide evidence to address the first two parts .",
    "continuous development of rnfs braids field lines of the magnetic elements , manifested by the cyclones seen in the euv observation .",
    "magnetic reconnection then takes place in the braiding fields , releasing the stored energy that heats the corona .",
    "it is supported by the observed brightenings ( microflares ) and euv waves .    up to now , one of the most common mechanisms to heat the corona is the impulsive energy release ( nanoflares , with times of minutes , and dimensions of mms ) that occurs in the small - scale magnetic fields ( parker 1988 ) .",
    "aia data indicate that microflares ( or nanoflares ) are not impulsive events .",
    "furthermore , they are accompanied with other activities . for example",
    ", in the 2010 july 20 cyclone , the microflare occurred 7 hours after the cyclone , followed by a small - scale euv wave .",
    "small - scale waves in the quiet sun may play a role in coronal heating : they transport energy to other places .",
    "the small - scale euv waves reported here propogate at a speed of 3585 km s@xmath4 , much slower than the euv waves originate from active regions , which is in arange of 200 - 400 km s@xmath4 ( see , e.g. , thompson & myers 2009 ) .",
    "the nature of the small - scale waves is an interesting question that needs further investigation .",
    "it may provide additional information that helps understand the euv waves that is still under intense debate ( wills - davey & thompson 1999 ; wu et al .",
    "2001 ; ofman & thompson 2002 ; schmidt & ofman 2010 ; delanne 2000 ; attrill et al . 2007 ;",
