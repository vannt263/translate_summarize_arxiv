    "we may use the above result for @xmath248 to prove the proposition by induction on the number of particles .",
    "we assume that the statement holds for @xmath139 cycles . a state associated to a cycle set",
    "may then be written as @xmath249 with @xmath250 for @xmath251 .",
    "the @xmath99-th cycle is called @xmath68 .",
    "let us examine an individual summand @xmath252 of @xmath225 .",
    "@xmath253 there is always a @xmath221 with @xmath254 for all @xmath255 . without loss of generality ,",
    "let this @xmath221 be @xmath256 . since we know that the statement holds for @xmath248",
    ", we may construct @xmath252 as follows : @xmath257 the cycles @xmath258 and @xmath259 arise from the decomposition of @xmath256 and @xmath68 into non - intersecting cycles .",
    "we choose @xmath260 , if the @xmath261-th summand is a combination of cycles as in the first part of and @xmath262 with @xmath263 , if we have a combination as in the second part of .",
    "we then have @xmath264 , @xmath265 for all @xmath266 and still @xmath267 for @xmath251 .",
    "hence , @xmath268 intersects at most @xmath269 cycles .",
    "the construction also assures @xmath270 for all @xmath148 and @xmath271 .",
    "this means that a cycle consisting of any edges of @xmath268 or @xmath221 can not intersect @xmath272 .",
    "if we again examine an individual summand of @xmath252 , we may therefore disregard @xmath272 and follow the same procedure as above with the @xmath269 remaining @xmath221 and @xmath268 in the role of @xmath68 .",
    "the result is a sum of states consisting of @xmath139 pairwise non - intersecting cycles @xmath273 , @xmath274 and",
    "@xmath275 and a cycle @xmath276 that intersects at most @xmath277 of the other cycles . if we iterate the process , after @xmath139 steps we obtain @xmath278 with @xmath279 for @xmath251 .",
    "this finally proves proposition [ prop : int ] .",
    "let us now proceed with the third step of our proof .",
    "we have to show that a state @xmath161 associated to a cycle set with pairwise non - intersecting cycles may be written as a sum of states of @xmath140 .",
    "we now give a procedure to construct this sum .",
    "let us first recall @xmath280 the product in shall be ordered in such a way that @xmath281 for all @xmath282 .",
    "this is always possible .",
    "for any @xmath283 , we obtain either @xmath284 or @xmath285 , if @xmath286 and @xmath287 as a consequence of this ordering .",
    "if we expand the product in , we obtain all possible combinations of @xmath288 with @xmath289 .",
    "let us now construct a basis state @xmath142 that contains such a combination .",
    "@xmath290 we choose @xmath84 such that @xmath291 .",
    "if @xmath292 , we set @xmath293 . if not , we choose @xmath294 . since @xmath295 in this case , these faces are all contained in @xmath296 .",
    "this procedure is easily continued up to @xmath297 .",
    "if @xmath298 for all @xmath299 , we choose @xmath300 to be @xmath301 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath302 has to be a cycle around possibly several @xmath303 , @xmath304 .",
    "however , the ordering of the @xmath305 in the first place assures that the faces which then have to be enclosed by @xmath302 are as well contained in @xmath306 . in this way",
    ", all combinations of @xmath307 can be constructed and the state @xmath161 may be written as a sum of states @xmath142 .",
    "this finally proves the theorem .",
    "we have given a basis for the many - particle ground states of the positive hopping bosonic hubbard model on line graphs of finite 2-connected planar bipartite graphs at sufficiently low filling factors .",
    "each element of that basis consists of localized non - overlapping single - particle ground states which may be placed next to or wrapped around each other .",
    "a boson in these states is localized on a cycle of the line graph .",
    "the construction works up to a critical filling factor at which the localized states are close - packed .",
    "the different arrangements of the localized states give rise to a large ground state degeneracy especially at fillings below the close - packed case .",
    "it would be interesting to know the exact degeneracy of the ground states .",
    "this would allow to determine the zero - temperature entropy per lattice site of the system which is finite for fillings below the critical filling factor .",
    "however , the computation of the degeneracy has proven to be a difficult task and we are not able to answer this question here . for a planar periodic lattice , the states formed by placing localized states on the lattice so that they do not overlap may be counted rather easily .",
    "e.g. _ @xmath0 be the honeycomb lattice . the problem of placing localized states on the honeycomb lattice so that they do not overlap can be mapped onto the exactly solvable hard - hexagon model @xcite .",
    "the crucial problem is the counting of the remaining states in which cycles are enclosing each other .",
    "therefore , the entropy of the exactly solvable hard - hexagon model is a lower bound to the entropy of the bosonic hubbard model on the kagome lattice . for general planar bipartite",
    "@xmath0 the problem of counting all sets of non - overlapping elementary cycles is difficult , so that for the general case already this lower bound can not easily be calculated .",
    "another intriguing problem is the generalization of our model to three dimensions . in this case , the construction of the single - particle basis we used in this work is not possible .",
    "the reason is that we make use of euler s theorem which guarantees a one - to - one correspondence between the faces of the original graph @xmath0 and the single particle ground states on the line graph @xmath29 . for non - planar @xmath0 we loose this correspondence .",
    "however , it is still possible to construct a basis for the single particle ground states using states localized on elementary cycles .",
    "the dimension of the space of single - particle ground states is still @xmath308 @xcite .",
    "hence , if one finds any @xmath309 linearly independent states localized on cycles of @xmath310 , they will form a basis .",
    "this can be easily done for _",
    "e.g. _ the cubic lattice .",
    "it is likely that all many - particle ground states can still be written as linear combinations of states associated to cycle sets which has to be proved .",
    "moreover , it should be possible to give a more general definition of contraction and uncontractibility of cycle sets , if one allows deformations of cycles only by adding / subtracting cycles that correspond to the single - particle basis states .    at the critical filling factor ( _ e.g. _ 1/9 for the kagome lattice ) the ground states of the system are close - packed",
    ". _ i.e. _ wigner crystals .",
    "the system becomes a mott insulator .",
    "a third open question is what happens when a small perturbation is added to the system .",
    "it is clear that a small perturbation to the single particle hamiltonian which lifts the degeneracy of the lowest band will lift ground states degeneracy of the multi - particle ground states as well . if one keeps translational invariance ( no disorder ) , the single particle ground states will be bloch states which can be build by linear combinations of the localized states we used .",
    "the question then is whether there is still a mott transition in this system ."
