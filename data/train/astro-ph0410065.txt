    "in rich clusters of galaxies , virial mass estimates agree well with independent determinations of the cluster mass made from the x - ray flux of hot intracluster gas , and from weak gravitational lensing effects",
    ". a typical ratio of the total mass - to - blue luminosity for rich clusters , @xmath9 , extrapolated over the whole volume of the universe , yields the mean density of matter @xmath100.25 , in the excellent concordance with parameters of the standard @xmath11cdm model : @xmath6 = 0.27 , @xmath12 = 0.73 ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "however , about 85% of galaxies are situated outside the rich clusters .",
    "roughly a half of them belong to groups of different size and population , while the remaining half are scattered in diffuse ( unvirialized ) `` clouds '' and `` filaments '' usually called the `` field '' . until recently , application of the virial theorem to galaxy groups remained the only way to trace the dark matter distribution on scales of 0.1  1 mpc",
    "measurements of the total mass of individual groups via their x - ray flux or weak gravitational lensing have not lead yet to distinct results .    in the case of our local group ( lg ) , lynden - bell ( 1981 ) and sandage ( 1986 )",
    "proposed to determine its total mass using a method , which is based on a measurement of the radius of the `` zero - velocity surface '' , @xmath13 , where the overdensity of the group has halted expansion and infall is about to commence . under the assumption of spherical symmetry the total mass of a group",
    "can be expressed in terms of the radius @xmath13 , the age of the universe @xmath14 , and the gravitational constant @xmath15 as @xmath16 application of this method to the lg as well to other groups requires accurate distances and radial velocities for all galaxies surrounding a group .",
    "such data is now accessible for several nearby groups by using the luminosity of stars at the tip of the red giant branch ( trgb ) as standard candles .",
    "over the last 5 years , searches for additional nearby dwarf galaxies , made on the poss - ii & eso / serc plates by karachentseva & karachentsev ( 1998 ; 2000 ) , and also results of `` blind '' hi surveys of the southern sky , and the zone of avoidance by the hipass team ( kilborn et al .",
    "2002 ) , as well as other wide - field sky surveys , lead to a doubling of the population of known galaxies in the local volume .",
    "basic observational data on 450 local volume galaxies with distances less than 10 mpc are presented in the catalog of neighboring galaxies ( karachentsev et al .",
    ".    the new quantity and quality of observational data on nearby galaxy distances and radial velocities allowed us to determine virial and total masses of four of the nearest complexes : milky way+m31 ( karachentsev et al .",

    "below we discuss the results of mass determination for all six nearest groups made via internal and external galaxy motions .",
    "our galaxy , the milky way , and the andromeda nebulae , m31 , together with their suites of dwarf companions are usually combined into the united dynamical system , the local group ( = lg ) .",
    "the basis for this is the observed mutual approaching of two the giant galaxies with a velocity of 123 km s@xmath17 .",
    "however , such a definition has an apparent disadvantage because the dynamical center of the lg turns out to be in emptiness , and individual motions of dwarf galaxies occur around the andromeda and milky way themselves . for this reason ,",
    "we prefer to consider both the giant spiral galaxies as the centers of two independent groups forming together the local complex of galaxies .      different properties of companions to our galaxy are described in detail in a monograph by van den bergh ( 2000 ) `` the galaxies of the local group '' .",
    "we will discuss here only the most general parameters of the group .",
    "the list of galaxies dynamically associated with the milky way is presented in table 1 .",
    "its columns contain : ( 1 ) galaxy name ; ( 2 ) morphological type ; ( 3,4 ) radial velocities with respect to the galaxy center and regarding to the lg centroid , respectively , with the apex parameters adopted in the nasa extragalactic database ( ned ) ; ( 5 ) absolute magnitude corrected for the galactic extinction ( schlegel et al . 1998 ) and internal galaxy extinction in the manner , which takes into account the galaxy inclination , as well as luminosity ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2004 ) ; ( 6 ) distance to the galaxy in mpc with indication of the method used : from the luminosity of cepheids ( cep ) , from the luminosity of the tip of the red giant brench ( rgb ) as given in ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2004 ) ; ( 7 ) the so called `` tidal index '' : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the total mass of any neighboring galaxy separated from the considered galaxy by a space distance @xmath20 ; for every galaxy `` @xmath21 '' we found its `` main disturber''(=md ) , producing the highest tidal action ; the value of the constant @xmath22 is chosen so that @xmath23 when the keplerian cyclic period of the galaxy with respect to its main disturber equals the cosmic hubble time , @xmath24 . in this sense , galaxies with @xmath25 may be considered as isolated objects of the general field . besides 15 members of the milky way group ,",
    "we indicate under the horizontal line at the bottom of table another four galaxies : tucana , sagdig , sexa , and sexb , for which the milky way is also the md .",
    "all of them move away from our galaxy , taking apparently part in the general cosmic expansion .",
    "note that the lmc stands out as the md with respect to the milky way and the smc .    by luminosity",
    ", the milky way appreciably dominates over the surrounding objects : the net luminosity of its 14 companions is an order magnitude lower than the milky way luminosity itself .",
    "the radius of gravitational prevalence of the milky way extends to @xmath0700 kpc , while the radial velocity dispersion of the companions is 86 km s@xmath17 with regard to the galaxy center and 76 km s@xmath17 with respect to the lg centroid .",
    "applying the virial theorem , we obtain for our group the mass estimate @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the dispersion of radial velocities with respect to the group centroid , and @xmath28 is the mean projected harmonic radius .",
    "this relation assumes a spherical symmetry of the group and a random orientation of velocity vectors for the group members .",
    "adopting @xmath29 = 68 kpc , gives us @xmath30 .",
    "for arbitrarily oriented keplerian orbits of companions with the eccentricity @xmath31 the robust estimator of mass is @xmath32 adopting @xmath31 = 0.7 as the average eccentricity , we derive for the companions of the milky way @xmath33 in excellent agreement with the previous estimate .",
    "however , two circumstances exist that force one to suppose that the two evaluations obtained overestimate the mass of our group .",
    "firstly , all the companions to milky way ( but for ngc 6822 ) are situated in an elongated volume with an axial ratio 8:3:1 , known as the polar magellanic stream . secondly , when observing orbital motions of the companions from inside , if orbits are strongly elongated then we see almost the full vectors of their velocities , i.e. the statistical relationship @xmath34 between radial and spatial velocity dispersions is not satisfied .      over the last five years five new companions to m 31 : and v , cas dsph , peg dsph , cetus , and and ix ( zucker et al .",
    "2004 ) have been discovered . as a result ,",
    "the present population of m 31 group exceeds the population of the group around our galaxy .",
    "the list of 19 members of the andromeda group is given in table 2 .",
    "the following information is provided in the table : ( 1 ) galaxy name ; ( 2 ) morphological type ; ( 3 ) radial velocity with respect to the lg centroid ; ( 4 ) absolute magnitude after corrections for internal and external extinctions ; ( 5 ) distance from the observer ; ( 6 ) angular separation from the m 31 , and ( 7 ) the tidal index .",
    "as it is seen , the maximum angular separation of the most remote companions to andromeda reaches one radian . at the bottom of the table under the horizontal line",
    "another four dwarf galaxies are given : ddo 210 , kkh 98 , kkr 25 , and kk 230 , for which the m 31 is the md .",
    "however , their crossing time with respect to the andromeda exceeds the age of the universe , which does not permit us to consider them physical members of the m 31 group . for 18 companions to andromeda",
    "their mean projected linear separation is 254 kpc , while the mean harmonic radius is 42 kpc .",
    "the radial velocity dispersion in the m 31 group , 77 km s@xmath17 , is nearly the same as in the milky way group .",

    "below the horizontal line in the table 3 , we give another six galaxies which may belong also to the far periphery of the m 81 group .",
    "some of them are associated with another spiral galaxy ngc 2403 rather than with m81 itself , forming a scattered system ( `` flock '' ) , which moves towards the m 81 .",
    "both from the radial velocity dispersion , @xmath38 = 91 km s@xmath17 , and from the linear projected radius , @xmath39 kpc , the m 81 group is similar to the milky way and the m 31 groups .",

    ". the updated lists of 28 and 14 members of both the groups are presented in tables 4 and 5 , respectively .",
    "notes in the last column indicate group members having another main disturbers ( not cen a or m 83 ) . under the horizontal lines",
    "there are some galaxies with larger projected separations which may be associated with the complex too .    in the cen",
    "a group its mean linear projected radius , 290 kpc , and radial velocity dispersion , 105 km s@xmath17 , are markedly greater than in the m 83 group ( 164 kpc and 71 km s@xmath17 ) that leads to a considerable difference in mass estimates of the groups : 489 ( vir ) and 288 ( orb ) in @xmath42 for the cen a , and 109 ( vir ) and 100 ( orb ) in @xmath42 for the m 83 group , respectively .",
    "such a difference is consistent with the assumption of bahcall et al .",
    "( 1995 ) that giant elliptical galaxies have a mass 2  3 times larger per unit luminosity than giant spiral galaxies .",

    "two galaxies , kkh 37 and kkh 6 , with negative tidal indexes ( in bottom of tables 6 and 7 ) do not belong , apparently , to the bound members of the complex .",
    "both the groups have a rather low dispersion of radial velocities , 54 km s@xmath17 ( ic 342 ) and 59 km s@xmath17 ( maffei ) , and quite typical mean linear projected separations , 322 kpc and 104 kpc , respectively .",
    "the virial and orbital mass estimates for the groups come to 57 and 95 ( ic 342 ) , and 65 and 135 ( maffei ) in units of @xmath42 .      as it was shown by jerjen et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , a conglomeration of bright galaxies in sculptor is a loose filament stretched along the line of sight and involved in the general cosmic expansion . according to karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2003c ) , the giant spiral galaxy ngc 253 and its five companions form a semi - virialized core of the filament .",
    "data on ngc 253 and its companions are given in table 8 . in its lower part",
    "we indicate also five more remote galaxies associated with the group core . at a radial velocity dispersion 54 km s@xmath17 and a mean harmonic projected radius @xmath43 kpc",
    ", estimates of mass of the group are 332 ( vir ) and 153 ( orb ) in units of @xmath42 .",
    "however , both the mass estimates look extremely unreliable since the group crossing time , @xmath44 gyr , is too long for the virialization of the system . note also , that inclusion of 5 more distant galaxies under the horizontal line in table 8 brings the crossing time closer to the hubble time , @xmath013 gyr .",
    "this very loose extended system mainly inhabited by dwarf irregular galaxies was studied by karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2003a ) . on the map of the sky region presented by the authors the cvni cloud occupies an area of about 35@xmath45 in diameter with the center near the brightest galaxy m 94 ( = ngc 4736 ) . for the sample of 34 members of the cloud , karachentsev et al .",

    "arrangement of galaxies by their tidal index shows that the brightest galaxy of the cvn i cloud , m 94 , is the main disturber relative only to 10 neighboring galaxies .",
    "all of them are presented in table 9 , where column designations are the same as in the previous tables . for 9 members of the m 94 group with positive tidal indices ,",
    "we obtain the radial velocity dispersion 56 km s@xmath17 , the mean harmonic projected radius 346 kpc , the mass estimates @xmath48 ( vir ) , @xmath49 ( orb ) , and the crossing time 6.9 gyr .",
    "thus , even the central region of the cvni cloud can not be considered as dynamically relaxed sub - system .",
    "in all the groups , but for the strongly obscured complex ic342/maffei , there is an appreciable number of diffuse dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( dsph ) .",
    "measurement of radial velocities for these smooth objects of low surface brightness is an extremely hard observational task due to absence in them of contrast details , as well as lack of neutral hydrogen .",
    "it is only in the closest dsph galaxies that one can measure the radial velocity from a globular cluster ( when available ) or the brightest stars .",
    "the majority of such `` bald '' dwarfs are concentrated in compact groups and virgo cluster ( karachentseva & sharina , 1987 ) .",
    "this fact suggests we can assign to `` bald '' dwarfs the mean distance of the group , in whose visible perimeter they are situated .",
    "measurements of distances to dsphs with the hst from trgb generaly confirm their membership in corresponding groups .    the total number of dsph+e companions in the complexes : milky way / m31 , m81 , cena / m83 , and ic342/maffei amount to 55 against 58 companions of dir+s types .",
    "`` bald '' companions show stronger concentration toward the principal galaxy as compared to gas - rich ones .",

    "one dsph object , cetus , is at a projected distance of over 500 kpc from the main galaxy of the group .",
    "the observed difference between the median projected separations ( 167 kpc vs. 210 kps ) may be considered as insignificant . nevertheless , among 233 galaxies having distances to us within 5 mpc , there are four only isolated early - type galaxies : ngc 404 ( @xmath50 = 1.0 , md = maffei 2 ) , kks3 ( @xmath50 = 0.3 , md = ngc 1313 ) , kk 258 ( @xmath50 = 0.9 , md = ngc 253 ) , and tucana ( @xmath50 = 0.1 , md = milky way ) .",
    "all of them are peculiar objects requiring special detailed study .    as an aside",
    ", it should be noted that the observed number of `` bald '' dwarfs in the group tends to increase with the luminosity of bulge of the main group member , and to decrease with crossing time of the group , which has a quite obvious evolutionary interpretation .",

    "the following information is provided in the table lines : ( 1,2 ) mean group distance from us and from the lg centroid ( in mpc ) ; when determining the lg centroid , we assumed that the total masses of the m 31 and the milky way are as 5 : 4 ( karachentsev & makarov , 1996 ) ; ( 3 ) distance of group center from the plane of the local supercluster ( in mpc ) ; ( 4,5 ) the known total number of members in the group and galaxies of early - type ( e+dsph ) ; ( 6,7 ) morphological type and absolute magnitude of the brightest member ; ( 8) rotation velocity of the main galaxy ( in km s@xmath17 ) ; ( 9 ) radial velocity of the principal member relative to the lg centroid ( km s@xmath17 ) ; ( 10 ) mean radial velocity of the group in the system of rest lg ( km s@xmath17 ) ; ( 11 ) dispersion of radial velocities in the group ( in km s@xmath17 ) ; ( 12 ) mean projected separation of the companions from the principal galaxy ( in kpc ) ; here the mean spatial distance of the milky way companions is multiplied by ( @xmath51/4 ) to account for projection effects ; ( 13 ) integrated blue luminosity of the group ; ( 14,15 ) virial and orbital mass estimates ( in @xmath42 units ) ; ( 16,17 ) virial and orbital mass - to - luminosity ratio in solar units ; ( 18 ) crossing time , @xmath52 , in gyr .    as it was to be expected ,",
    "two loose systems : sculptor filament and cvni cloud are characterized by the greatest crossing time , which exceeds half the hubble time .",
    "these two systems ( the last right columns in table 10 ) have obviously not reached an dynamical equilibrium , and we will no discuss them further .",

    "\\e ) the crossing times in neighboring groups are concentrated within [ 1.8  5.9 ] gyr , while the median , 2.3 gyr , is 6 times as small as the hubble time , which enables these groups to be regarded as advanced in their dynamical evolution .",
    "precise measurements of distances and radial velocities for galaxies surrounding a group permits one to determine the radius of zero- velocity surface , @xmath13 , which separates the group from the general cosmic expansion .",
    "determinations of @xmath13 for the six nearest groups were performed by karachentsev et al .",

    "the fourth line gives the total mass calculated from @xmath13 as @xmath54 , where the age of the universe is adopted to be ( 13.7@xmath530.2 ) gyr ( spergel et al . 2003 ) .",
    "the last two lines indicate the total blue luminosity of the group / complex and the total mass - to - luminosity ratio , respectively .",
    "figure 1 shows the relationship between mass estimates for the groups made by two quite independent series of observational data : from internal motions of group members ( horizontal ) and from external motions of galaxies surrounding the group .",
    "two complexes which are likely unbound : the canes venatici i cloud and the sculptor filament are shown by the dotted boxes .    all four likely virialized systems : milky way / m31 , m81/ngc2403 , cena / m83 , and ic342/maffei manifest quite satisfactory agreement between independent mass estimates . in two",
    "apparently unvirialized expanding complexes ( sculptor and cvni ) , their virial / orbital mass estimates turn out to be 3  8 times larger than the total masses estimated via @xmath13 .",
    "the derived total mass - to - luminosity ratios show a surprisingly low scatter , being ranked inside [ 9  37 ] with a median of 19 in solar units .",
    "the ratio of the sum of the total masses for the four complexes to the sum of their total luminosity is @xmath55 .",
    "as we have already noted , all the groups under discussion are situated in the sphere of radius 5 mpc . from the presently available data ,",
    "this volume contains 233 galaxies .",
    "about half of them , 121/233 , are members of the lg , the m81/ngc2403 group , the cena / m83 group , and the ic342/maffei group .",
    "besides them , 62 more galaxies in the 5 mpc- sphere ( i.e. 27% ) belong to smaller multiple systems around ngc 3109 , ugc 8760 , ngc 784 , and ugc 3974 , and two expanding complexes in sculptor and canes venatici .",
    "thus , the relative number of the group members in the local volume accounts for about 78% , and only 22% of nearby galaxies can be considered to be the population of the general `` field '' .    according to the `` catalog of neighboring galaxies '' ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2004 ) , the integrated luminosity of all galaxies within 5 mpc is @xmath56 ( 5 mpc ) = @xmath57 . from the fifth line of table 11 ,",
    "the integrated luminosity of the virialized groups is @xmath58 or 65% of the total luminosity of the volume . with allowance made for the sculptor filament and the cvni cloud ,",
    "the fraction of local luminous matter in systems increases to 82% .",
    "the numbers presented reflect the known effect of segregation of galaxies by luminosity , with the concentration of dwarf galaxies in groups less pronounced than for giant galaxies .",
    "one of the remarkable properties of the spatial distribution of galaxies is its fractality . on different scales , groups / clusters look like dense knots in filaments which concentrate towards sheets , forming as a whole a fractal `` cosmic web '' pattern .",
    "this general picture is valid for the local volume too . in the local sphere of radius",
    "5 mpc all the virialized groups are situated in a layer of @xmath53(1/3 ) mpc around the local `` pancake '' , which occupies only 10% of the sphere volume , @xmath59 = 523 mpc@xmath60 .",
    "however , the sum of 4 group volumes with radii @xmath61 mpc each add to only 20 mpc@xmath60 or @xmath04% of the local volume .",
    "thus , in the local volume of 5 mpc radius , only a small part ( 4% ) is not involved in the hubble expansion , but about 70% of luminous matter is concentrated in this volume .",
    "obviously , any theory of galaxy formation must explain these dimensionless empirical parameters of the local web . on scales of 10  100 mpc",
    ", such an approach is being developed by shandarin ( 2004 ) .    giving preference to estimates of the total mass from the pattern of the velocity field of galaxies surrounding groups",
    ", we obtain the total mass of six complexes ( line 4 in table 11 ) , @xmath62 , which yields the mean density of matter inside the 5 mpc sphere @xmath63(5 mpc ) = @xmath64 mpc@xmath60 . at @xmath65",
    "km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , the critical density of matter , @xmath66 ) , is equal to @xmath67 mpc@xmath60 .",
    "consequently , the mean local density of matter is only @xmath63 ( 5 mpc ) = 0.10 @xmath68 .",
    "it follows from the data of the catalog ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2004 ) that the mean density of luminosity within 5 mpc equals @xmath69/mpc@xmath60 . comparing this with the mean luminosity density estimated from the sloan digital sky survey ( blanton et al .",
    "2003 ) and the millenium galaxy catalogue ( liske et al . 2003 ) , we obtain a ratio @xmath70 mpc)/ @xmath71 . here",
    "we took into account that ignoring internal extinction in galaxies in sloandss and mgc causes underestimates of @xmath72 by a factor of 1/3 . supposing that on different scales the mass density is strictly proportional to the luminosity density ( no biasing ) , then the mean density of matter contained in the groups leads to the value of global density of matter of about 0.025 of the critical density",
    "over the past few years , it has repeatedly been noted ( sandage , 1986 , karachentsev & makarov , 2001 , ekholm et al .",
    "2001 , karachentsev et al .",
    "2003b ) that the local hubble flow is rather cold with a dispersion of radial velocities less than 70 km s@xmath17 .",
    "as can be seen from the data of table 10 , the dispersion of virial velocities in nearby groups has approximately the same value . for the galaxies situated outside the groups , the estimates of @xmath38 are",
    "chiefly determined by errors of measurements of distances to galaxies , and the role played by these errors enhances with distance . in the immediate vicinities of the lg on scales of 2  3 mpc ,",
    "the radial velocity dispersion for the field galaxies is only 25  30 km s@xmath17 ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2002c ) .",
    "apparently , it is not always easy to distinguish between true isolated galaxies and members of loose groups . for this reason ,",
    "it is interesting to examine the behaviour of group centers , but not individual galaxies on the hubble diagram .",
    "such a hubble relation is displayed in figure 2 using the data of lines 2 and 10 of table 10 .",
    "the errors of measurements of the mean velocities of the groups are not large ( @xmath73 km s@xmath17 ) , and we do not show them here .",
    "the horizontal bars correspond to the errors of the average distance of the groups being usually @xmath010% .",
    "the line corresponds to the hubble relation with @xmath65 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 and a lg zero - velocity surface at 0.95 mpc .",
    "dispersion of radial velocities obtained from these data for the centroids is 25 km s@xmath17 after quadratic subtracting of distance errors .",
    "the low values of `` thermal '' velocities of the galaxies in the field and the centers of the groups are remarkably consistent with the low estimates of the mean density of matter in the local volume .",
    "note that the global value @xmath74 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 fits fairly the local hubble flow .",
    "above , we considered the nearest groups only , because the quality of data on distances of galaxies situated beyond 5 mps is rather unsatisfactory .",
    "for instance , the majority of galaxies in the layer @xmath75 mpc have no direct individual distance estimates at all .",
    "nevertheless , the catalog of neighboring galaxies provide us with data on tidal indices and the names of the main disturber for each galaxy within 10 mpc , giving an idea of the location and population of more distant groups . without discussing characteristics of these groups ,",
    "let us enumerate only the most representative of them containing four or more members : ngc 672 ( 5 ) , ngc 2784 ( 6 ) , ngc 3115 ( 7 ) , ngc 3368/3412/3489= leo - i group ( 37 ) , ngc 4244 ( 4 ) , ngc 4594 ( 7 ) , m101 ( 5 ) , and ngc 6946 ( 7 ) . here",
    ", every group is noted by the name of the brightest member , and the number of group members with @xmath76 0 is shown in brackets .",
    "apart from the leo - i group , all others resemble the local group by a prevalence of a single galaxy .",
    "linear dimensions , velocity dispersions and luminosities of the groups are similar to parameters indicated in table 10 .",
    "only the leo - i group is different from the others by the presence of several giant members of early ( e , s0,sa ) types , comparable to each other in luninosity .",
    "this group , resembling a mini - cluster , is characterized by the projected radius of 350 kpc , the radial velocity dispersion of 130 km s@xmath17 , and the virial mass - to - luminosity ratio of @xmath77 ( karachentsev & karachentseva , 2004 ) .",
    "the galaxy groups of the leo - i - type are much more sparse than groups of the lg - type : in the 10 mpc volume around us the ratio of their numbers is approximately 1:30 .",
    "hence , the leo - i - type groups make a contribution of minor importance to the mean density of matter .",
    "properties of groups situated within the local supercluster have been recently studied by makarov & karachentsev ( 2000 ) .",
    "they applyed a new algorithm ( similar to a criterion @xmath76 0 ) to a distribution of 6320 galaxies with radial velocities @xmath78 km s@xmath17 and selected 839 groups . for the groups with population @xmath79 the following median characteristics",
    "were derived : the radial velocity dispersion of 86 km s@xmath17 , the projected harmonic radius of 250 kpc , the crossing time of 1.5 gyr , and the virial mass - to - luminosity ratio of @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the characteristics of the nearest groups do not differ essentially from the main dynamical characteristics of more representative sample covering a scale of @xmath030 mpc .",
    "as it has been mentioned above , determinations of mass of the galaxy clusters , made by different ways , yield mutualy concordant results with a typical mass - to - luminosity ratio about ( 250  300 ) @xmath2 in the @xmath81 band . assuming the linear proportionality between dark and luminous matter this leads to the global density of matter in the universe @xmath82 , in agreement with wmap ( spergel et al .",
    "however , only ( 10  15)% of all galaxies are concentrated in rich clusters .",
    "hence , the collective input of clusters into @xmath6 consist of 0.03  0.04 only .",
    "most of galaxies , about ( 50  70)% , are situated in groups of different size and population , with the lg and other nearest groups typical representatives .",
    "recent accurate measurements of distances to galaxies open a possibility to measure group masses by two independent manners : via internal and via external galaxy motions . applied to the well studied neighboring groups , both",
    "the methods manifest good mutual agreement .",
    "however the mass - to - luminosity ratios for groups turn out to be one order less than for clusters .",
    "it means that the hypothesis assuming linear proportionality of dark and luminous matter on different scales is not valid .",
    "since the `` external '' method estimates the total mass of group on a scale of @xmath83 mpc , but the `` internal '' method yields virial / orbital mass estimate on a lower scale , @xmath84 kpc , then the dark matter in groups is tightly tied to the luminous one .",
    "the case of the nearest group around andromeda shows that the total mass of the m31 halo , @xmath85 is reached already on the scales of ( 50  125 ) kpc , i.e. one order less than the group turn - over radius @xmath13 .",
    "as it is seen from figure 2 , centroids of the nearby groups have a low velocity dispersion with respect to the hubble flow that is an independent evidence of the low mean density of matter in the local volume ( governato et al .",
    "the principal galaxies in nearby groups ( shown by crosses in figure 2 ) have small peculiar velocities too . only in the m 81 group",
    "do we find a significant peculiar velocity of the main member .",
    "( the situation in the maffei group is complicated by heavy galactic extinction , as well as confusion of hi emission from the group members with the galactic hi emission ) .",
    "an apparent reason of the high peculiar velocity of the m 81 is the presence nearby m 81 of another bright galaxy , m 82 , which has a peculiar velocity of opposite sign ( see table 3 ) .",
    "moreover , the peculiar velocities of m 81 and m 82 are inversly proportional to their luminosities .",
    "consequently , the galaxies m 81 and m 82 are moving in the group as heavy bodies driven by the law of conservation of motion , rather than as test particles inside the common smooth potential well .",
    "supposing the dark matter in groups follows tightly the luminous matter , we can estimate the total contribution of groups to the mean density of matter .",
    "based on the average weighted values : @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 in solar units , we derive the total contribution of groups of galaxies to the mean density of matter to be ( 0.03  0.04 ) in critical density units .",
    "recently , guzik & seljak ( 2002 ) and hoekstra et al . (",
    "2004 ) determined parameters of dark halos for field galaxies and members of loose groups from weak lensing in the sloan dss and in the red - sequence cluster survey . for a galaxy with the mean luminosity of @xmath89 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 ) they derived a characteristic ratio @xmath90 = 41 @xmath2 on a scale of @xmath0250 kpc ( after correction for internal extinction ) .",
    "this independent result agrees well with our data .",
    "thus , we may conclude that groups and clusters of galaxies produce approximately the same contribution to the mean density of matter .",
    "their combined contribution is about 0.06  0.08 in the units of critical density or about ( 1/5  1/3 ) with respect to @xmath5 . to avoid a contradiction with the global matter density @xmath5 , derived from the wmap",
    ", we need to assume the existence of another ( non - baryonic ) component of dark matter with the mean density @xmath8 .",
    "the dm2-component may be distributed in space either homogeneously likes a dark cosmic `` ocean '' , or consists of many low mass halos without gas and stars , as assumed by tully et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and tully ( 2004 ) .",
    "obviously , the presence of the dm2- component does not significantly affect the kinematics of even loose groups , because it contributes a small fraction ( about 10% within @xmath91 mpc and about 0.1% within @xmath92 mpc ) into the integrated mass of groups .",
