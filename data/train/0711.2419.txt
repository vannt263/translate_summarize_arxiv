    "we consider an invariant hypo - elliptic diffusion process @xmath2 , @xmath11 on a connected lie group @xmath1 together with a right - invariant haar measure @xmath12 , which is then also invariant for the diffusion process @xmath2 . the vector fields @xmath13 are assumed to be left - invariant vector fields , and their brackets generate the lie algebra . in the spirit of sub - riemannian geometry",
    "the hypo - elliptic diffusion process can be used to define a metric ( the carnot - carathodory metric @xmath14 ) a geodesic structure and the notion of a gradient ( the horizontal gradient @xmath15 ) on @xmath1 .",

    "fix @xmath18 .",
    "the natural ornstein - uhlenbeck process on @xmath8 associated to @xmath2 will be @xmath19 out of two reasons : first the law of @xmath16 is an invariant measure for @xmath20 and , second , there is a spectral gap for @xmath20 if @xmath2 satisfies a driver - melcher inequality ( see section 4 for precise details ) .",
    "we can easily extend all results to compact homogeneous spaces @xmath10 .",
    "the possible exponential convergence rate is then applied for new simulated annealing algorithms .",
    "the interest in those new algorithms lies in the fact that there are less brownian motions than space dimensions of the optimization problem involved , and that the stochastic differential equations might have a smaller complexity and is therefore easier to evaluate .    for this purpose",
    "we consider cases where the size of the spectral gap for the previously introduced process @xmath21 is @xmath22 for some constant @xmath23 ( see section 5 for precise details ) .",
    "this holds true for instance on @xmath24 or on the heisenberg tori .",
    "let @xmath3 be a smooth potential on @xmath10 .",
    "we regard an equation of the type @xmath25 as a compact perturbation of the natural ou process in order to get an estimate for its spectral gap , which can be expressed by @xmath26 for all @xmath27 and some constant @xmath28 .",
    "this amounts to a comparison of @xmath3 with the square of the carnot - carathodory metric @xmath29 due to short - time asymptotics of the heat kernel on the compact manifold @xmath10 .",
    "a concatenation of trajectories of such equations under a cooling schedule @xmath30 leads then to the desired simulated annealing algorithms .",
    "the analytical arguments are strongly inspired by the seminal works of r.  holley , s.  kusuoka and d.  stroock @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we consider a finite - dimensional , connected lie group @xmath1 with lie algebra @xmath31 , its right - invariant haar measure @xmath12 and a family of left - invariant vector fields @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that hrmander s condition holds , i.e.   the sub - algebra generated by @xmath13 coincides with @xmath31 .",
    "we consider furthermore a stochastic basis @xmath33 with a @xmath14-dimensional brownian motion @xmath34 and the lie group valued process    dx^x_t = _",

    "furthermore , we define a semigroup @xmath37 acting on bounded measurable functions @xmath38 by @xmath39 this semigroup can be extended to a strongly continuous semigroup on @xmath40 , which we will denote by the same letter @xmath41 .",
    "the carr du champ operator @xmath42 is defined for functions @xmath43 , where it makes sense , by    ( f , g ) = ( fg ) - f g - gf .    in our particular case , we obtain immediately @xmath44 notice that the carr du champ operator does not change if we add a drift to the generator @xmath0 .    due to the right invariance of the haar measure @xmath12 and the left - invariance of the vector fields @xmath45 , the operator @xmath0 is symmetric ( reversible ) with respect to @xmath12 and therefore @xmath12 is an infinitesimal invariant measure in the sense that @xmath46 for all smooth compactly supported test functions @xmath47 .",
    "furthermore , due to the symmetry of @xmath48 we have from the relation    2 f g = - ( f , g )    for all @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "let now @xmath51 be an arbitrary smooth function such that @xmath52 we consider the modified generator @xmath53 notice that @xmath54 is an infinitesimal invariant ( finite ) measure for @xmath55 , since , by ,    ^u f ^u & = ( f ) ( -u ) - ( u , f ) ( -u ) + & = - ( f , ( -u ) ) - ( f , u ) ( -u)= 0 ,    and notice that @xmath55 is symmetric on @xmath56 in the sense that    f ^u g ^u = g ^u f ^u = - ( f , g ) ^u    for all smooth compactly supported test functions @xmath57 . the last equality is often referred to as integration by parts .    by definition and by integration by parts the operator @xmath55 has a spectral gap at @xmath58 of size @xmath59 in @xmath60 if and only if @xmath61 for all compactly supported smooth functions @xmath43 on @xmath1 satisfying @xmath62    if we want to write an inequality for all test functions @xmath43 , it reads like    _ g ( f , f)(x ) ^u(dx ) 2a ( _ g f(x)^2 ^u(dx )",

    "s theorem @xcite , the function @xmath68 is a positive and smooth function , hence the potential @xmath69 is as in the previous section .",
    "we write for short @xmath70 instead of @xmath71 and we call the associated markov process the * natural ou - process on @xmath8 associated to the diffusion @xmath72*. we show that we have in fact global strong solutions for the corresponding stratonovich sde with values in @xmath1 . the next proposition is slightly more general .",
    "[ globalexistence ] consider a smooth potential @xmath51 such that    ( -u(x))(dx ) < .",

    "since the coefficients defining are smooth by assumption , there exists a unique strong solution up to the explosion time    _ y = \\{t : _",

    "we then define a semigroup @xmath75 on @xmath76 by    ( _ t f)(y ) = ( f(y_t^y ) _ _ y > t ) .",
    "it can be shown in the exact same way as in @xcite that @xmath75 is a strongly continuous contraction semigroup and that its generator @xmath77 coincides with @xmath78 on the set @xmath79 of compactly supported smooth functions .",
    "on the other hand , setting @xmath80 , one can show as in @xcite that @xmath78 is essentially self - adjoint , so that one must have @xmath81 .",

    "while this argument shows that , given a fixed initial condition @xmath90 , there exists a unique global strong solution @xmath91 to , it does not prevent more subtle kinds of explosions , see for example @xcite .    by proposition [ globalexistence ] and",
    "since @xmath65 is smooth and integrable , it follows immediately that the ou - process exists globally in a strong sense",
    ".    for any given @xmath92 , the process @xmath93 with @xmath94 has a global strong solution .",
    "more traditional lyapunov - function based techniques seem to be highly non - trivial to apply for this situation , due to the lack of information on the behaviour of @xmath95 at large @xmath90 . in view of @xcite",
    ", it is tempting to conjecture that one has the asymptotic    _ 0 ^2 _ p(,y ) = d^2(e , y ) ,    and that the limit holds uniformly over compact sets @xmath96 that do not contain the origin @xmath97 .",
    "( note that it follows from @xcite that this is true provided that @xmath96 does not intersect the cut - locus . )",
    "if it were the case that holds , possible space - time scaling properties of @xmath98 could imply that , for every @xmath99 , there exists a compact set @xmath96 such that @xmath100 for @xmath101 . on the other hand , one has @xmath102 so that this would imply that @xmath103 is a lyapunov function for the corresponding ou - process leading to another proof of the previous corollary .",
    "next we consider the question if @xmath70 admits a spectral gap on @xmath104 for @xmath105 , which turns out to be a consequence of the driver - melcher inequality ( see @xcite ) .",
