    "the angular - momentum properties of a galaxy system must have had a crucial role in determining its evolution and final type .",
    "a long history of research , involving hoyle ( 1953 ) and peebles ( 1969 ) , led to a ` standard ' theory for the origin of angular momentum in the cosmological framework of hierarchical structure formation , the tidal - torque theory ( hereafter ttt ) , as put together by doroshkevich ( 1970 ) and white ( 1984 ) .",
    "special interest in the subject has been revived recently because of an ` angular - momentum crisis ' , arising from cosmological simulations of galaxy formation which seem to yield luminous galaxies that are significantly smaller , and of much less angular momentum than observed disc galaxies ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 , 2000 ) .",
    "another current motivation comes from weak lensing studies , where the intrinsic distribution and alignment of galaxy shapes , which may be derived from ttt , play an important role in interpreting the signal ( croft & metzler 2000 ; heavens , refregier & heymans 2000 ; catelan , kamionkowski & blandford 2001 ; catelan & porciani 2001 ; crittenden 2001 ) .",
    "these add a timely aspect to the motivation for revisiting the classical problem of angular momentum , in an attempt to sharpen and deepen our understanding of its various components and how they work together .",
    "in particular , this effort should start from the acquisition of angular momentum by dark - matter haloes , despite the misleading apparent impression that this part of the theory is fairly well understood .",
    "the basic notion of ttt is that most of the angular momentum is being gained gradually by proto - haloes in the linear regime of density fluctuations growth , due to tidal torques from neighboring fluctuations .",
    "this process is expected to continue as long as the proto - halo is expanding .",
    "once it decouples from the expanding background and turns around to non - linear collapse and virialization , only little angular momentum is expected to be tidally exchanged between haloes .",
    "it is commonly assumed that the baryonic material , which in general follows the dark - matter distribution inside each proto - halo , gains a similar specific angular momentum and carries it along when it contracts to form a luminous galaxy at the halo centre .",
    "this should allow us to predict galactic spins using the approximate but powerful analytic tools of quasi - linear theory of gravitational instability . even if angular momentum is transferred from the gas to the dark matter during disc formation , the initial set - up of angular - momentum distribution in the halo is an important ingredient in the process .    in a series of papers ,",
    "we evaluate the performance of the ttt approximation , and trace the roles of its various ingredients and the cross - talk between them .",
    "we do it using a cosmological @xmath2-body simulation with @xmath7 well - resolved haloes .",
    "we find that some of the basic ingredients of standard ttt involve certain unjustified assumptions and that our understanding of the theory is not full .",
    "these papers represent attempts to clarify some of these controversial issues . in paper",
    "i ( porciani , dekel & hoffman 2001 ) , we evaluate how well does the approximation predict the final spin of a halo , given full knowledge of the corresponding initial proto - halo and the cosmological realization . in the present paper ( paper ii ) , we attempt a deeper level of understanding of the origin of halo angular momentum , by investigating the relation between the different components of ttt . we find that this study connects to the fundamental open question of how to identify a proto - halo in a given realization of initial conditions , and how proto - haloes evolve via collapse and mergers to the present virialized haloes . while the current discussion of proto - haloes and their evolution is limited to first results , a more detailed analysis will be reported in future papers . in paper iii ( porciani & dekel in preparation ) , the standard scaling relation of ttt is revised , based on our finding that the shear tensor is weakly correlated with the density at the proto - halo centre of mass .",
    "this scaling relation is used to predict the typical angular - momentum profile of haloes ( dekel 2001 ; bullock 2001b ) , and to provide a simple way to incorporate angular momentum in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( maller , dekel & somerville 2002 ) .    according to ttt ,",
    "the angular momentum of a halo is due to the cross - talk between two key players : the inertia tensor @xmath0 , describing the quadrupole structure of the proto - halo , and the shear tensor @xmath1 , representing the external tidal field exerting the torque .",
    "there is a controversy in the literature regarding the correlation between these two components , which makes a big difference in the outcome . in applications of ttt",
    ", it has commonly been assumed that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are uncorrelated ( e.g. hoffman 1986a , b ; heavens & peacock 1988 ; steinmetz & bartelmann 1995 ; catelan & theuns 1996 ) , based on the argument that the former is local and the latter must be dominated by external sources .",
    "lee & pen ( 2000 , hereafter lp00 ) , based on simulations with limited resolution , have raised some doubts concerning this assumption .",
    "other applications have made the assumption that the present - day halo angular momentum correlates with the shear tensor of the initial conditions ( lp00 ; pen 2000 ; crittenden 2001 ) .",
    "this involves assuming both a strong correlation at the initial conditions and that this correlation survives the non - linear evolution at late times . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the validity of these assumptions , and find surprising results that shed new light on the basic understanding of ttt .",
    "one of our pleasant surprises is that a high degree of correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 leads to progress in a more general problem , that of identifying proto - haloes in the initial conditions . despite the impressive progress made in analysing the statistics of peaks in gaussian random density fields ( bardeen 1986 ; hoffman 1986b ;",
    "bond & myers 1996 ) , given a realization of such initial conditions we do not have a successful recipe for identifying the proto - halo centers and the lagrangian region about them which will end up in the final virialized halo .",
    "we find that proto - haloes are only vaguely associated with density peaks .",
    "straightforward ideas for identifying the boundaries , such as involving iso - density or iso - potential contours ( bardeen 1986 ; hoffman 1986b , 1988b ; heavens & peacock 1988 ; catelan & theuns 1996 ) , do not provide a successful algorithm ( van de weygaert & babul 1994 ; bond & myers 1996 ) .",
    "these are key missing ingredients in a full theory for the origin of angular momentum as well as for more general aspects of galaxy formation theory .",
    "we make here the first steps towards an algorithm that may provide the missing pieces .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows : in we summarize the basics of linear tidal - torque theory . in",
    "we describe the simulation and halo finder , and the implementation of ttt to proto - haloes . in",
    "we address the correlation between the shear field and the inertia tensor of the proto - halo . in",
    "we show examples of the @xmath8 correlation , and address the implications on the characteristics of proto - halo regions and how they evolve . in",
    "we refer to other properties of proto - haloes . in",
    "we address the correlation between the shear field and the spin direction . in",
    "we discuss our results and conclude .",
    "here is a brief summary of the relevant basics of tidal - torque theory , which is described in some more detail in paper i.    the framework is the standard frw cosmology in the matter - dominated era , with small density fluctuations that grow by gravitational instability . given a proto - halo , a patch of matter occupying an eulerian volume @xmath9 that is destined to end up in a virialized halo , the goal is to compute its angular momentum about the centre of mass , to the lowest non - vanishing order in perturbation theory . the angular momentum at time @xmath10 is @xmath11 \\times \\left [ \\bfv ( t)-\\bfv_{\\rm cm}(t ) \\right ] d^3r \\ , , \\label{eq : lprop}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the position and peculiar velocity , and the subscript cm denotes centre - of - mass quantities .",
    "then , in comoving units @xmath14 , @xmath15 \\left [ \\bfx ( t)-\\bfx_{\\rm cm}(t ) \\right ] \\times \\dot{\\bfx}(t ) \\ , d^3x \\ , , \\label{eq : lcomove}\\ ] ] where @xmath16 is the density fluctuation field relative to the average density @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the universal expansion factor , and the term proportional to @xmath19 vanished .",
    "a dot denotes a derivative with respect to cosmic time @xmath10 .",
    "the comoving eulerian position of each fluid element is given by its initial , lagrangian position @xmath20 plus a displacement : @xmath21 .",
    "when fluctuations are sufficiently small , or when the flow is properly smoothed , the mapping @xmath22 is reversible such that the flow is _",
    "laminar_. then the jacobian determinant @xmath23 does not vanish , and the continuity equation implies @xmath24=j^{-1}(\\bfq , t)$ ] .",
    "substituting in one obtains @xmath25 \\times",
    "\\dot{\\bfs}(\\bfq , t ) \\,d^3q\\ , , \\label{eq : llag}\\ ] ] where barred quantities are averages over @xmath20 in @xmath26 , the lagrangian region corresponding to @xmath9 .",
    "the displacement @xmath27 is now spelled out using the _",
    "zeldovich _ approximation ( zeldovich 1970 ) , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 ( with @xmath30 newton s gravitational constant ) , and @xmath31 is the gravitational potential .",
    "substituting in one obtains @xmath32 the explicit growth rate is @xmath33 , which is @xmath34 as long as the universe is einstein - de sitter , or close to flat ( and matter dominated ) .",
    "next , assume that the potential is varying smoothly within the volume @xmath26 , such that it can be approximated by its _ second - order _ taylor expansion about the centre of mass , . ]",
    "@xmath35 where @xmath36 . substituting in",
    ", one obtains the basic ttt expression for the @xmath37th cartesian component : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the antisymmetric tensor , and the two key quantities are the _ deformation _ tensor at @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the _ inertia _ tensor of @xmath26 , @xmath42    note that only the traceless parts of the two tensors matter for the cross product in .",
    "these are the velocity _ shear _ or _ tidal _ tensor , @xmath43 , and the traceless quadrupolar inertia tensor , @xmath44 .",
    "thus , to the first non - vanishing order , angular momentum is transferred to the proto - halo by the gravitational coupling of the quadrupole moment of its mass distribution with the tidal field exerted by neighboring density fluctuations .",
    "the torque depends on the _ misalignment _ between the two .",
    "we summarize here the relevant issues concerning the simulation , the halo finding , and the way we implement ttt .",
    "a more detailed description is provided in paper i.    the @xmath2-body simulation was performed as part of the gif project ( , kauffmann 1999 ) using the adaptive p@xmath45 m code developed by the virgo consortium ( pearce 1995 ; pearce & couchman 1997 ) . as an example , we use a simulation of the @xmath46cdm scenario , in which the cosmology is flat , with density parameter @xmath47 and hubble constant @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the power spectrum of initial density fluctuations is cdm with shape parameter @xmath50 , normalized to @xmath51 today .",
    "the simulation was performed in a periodic cubic box of side @xmath52 , with @xmath53 particles of @xmath54 each .",
    "long - range gravitational forces were computed on a @xmath55 mesh , while short - range interactions were calculated as in efstathiou & eastwood ( 1981 ) . at late times ( @xmath56 ) , the gravitational potential asymptotically matches a plummer law with softening @xmath57 .",
    "the simulation started at @xmath58 and ended at @xmath59 .",
    "the initial conditions were generated by displacing particles according to the zeldovich approximation from an initial stable ` glass ' state ( e.g. white 1996 ) .",
    "more details are in jenkins ( 1998 )",
    ".    shows a typical halo and its proto - halo , to help illustrating the objects of our analysis .",
    "we identify dark - matter haloes at @xmath59 using a standard friends - of - friends algorithm with a linking length @xmath60 in units of the average inter - particle distance .",
    "this algorithm identifies regions bounded by a surface of approximately constant density , corresponding to haloes with a mean density contrast @xmath61 , in general agreement with spherical perturbations whose outer shells have collapsed recently .",
    "we then remove unbound particles from each halo , and consider only haloes which contain more than 100 bound particles .",
    "our results turn out to be insensitive to the removal of unbound particles , which is at a typical level of only a few per cent .    the robustness of our conclusions regarding ttt with respect to the halo - finding algorithm ( , friends - of - friends versus fitting a spherical or ellipsoidal density profile , bullock 2001a ) is investigated in another paper in preparation .",
    "note that all the haloes in our current sample are not subclumps of larger host haloes , for which linear theory is not expected to be valid .",
    "this excludes about 10 per cent of the haloes that are more massive than @xmath62 ( sigad 2001 ) .",
    "the proto - halo regions @xmath26 are defined by simply tracing all the virialized halo particles , as identified today , into their lagrangian positions . in most cases ,",
    "most of the proto - halo mass is contained within a simply connected lagrangian region , but in some cases ( @xmath63 per cent ) the proto - halo may be divided into two or three compact regions which are connected by thin filaments .",
    "nearly 10 per cent of the proto - haloes are characterized by extended filaments departing from a compact core .",
    "a typical case is illustrated in , where we show a halo at @xmath59 and its proto - halo at @xmath58 , embedded in the surrounding particles in a comoving slice that includes most of the halo particles .",
    "= 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm = 6.0 cm    for each proto - halo , we compute the lagrangian inertia tensor by direct summation over its @xmath2 particles of mass @xmath64 each : @xmath65 with @xmath66 the position of the @xmath67-th particle with respect to the halo centre of mass .    the shear tensor at the proto - halo centre of mass is computed by first smoothing the potential used to generate the initial zeldovich displacements , and then differentiating it twice with respect to the spatial coordinates ( _ method 1 _ ) .",
    "smoothing is done using a top - hat window function , while derivatives are computed on a grid . the top - hat smoothing radius , in comoving units ,",
    "is taken to be defined by the halo mass via @xmath68 . in paper",
    "i we also tested two alternative methods for computing the shear tensor : _ method 2 _ , in which the smoothing has been replaced by minimal variance fitting , and _ method 3 _ , also with minimal variance fitting , but in which we considered only the shear generated by the density perturbations lying outside the proto - halo volume .",
    "the ttt predictions for the halo spin based on the three methods were found to be of similar quality at @xmath59 , while methods 2 and 3 are slightly more accurate at very high redshift .",
    "we adopt method 1 here because it does not depend explicitly on the detailed shape of the proto - haloes , which prevents spurious correlations between @xmath1 and @xmath0 due to the way @xmath1 is computed .",
    "also , this is the only method applicable in analytic and semi - analytic modelling .",
    "= 12 cm    in paper i , we evaluated the success of ttt in predicting the final halo angular momentum for a given proto - halo embedded in a given tidal environment at the initial conditions . for a deeper understanding of how ttt works ,",
    "we now proceed to investigate the key players : the inertia and shear tensors and in particular the cross - talk between them .",
    "note , in , that angular momentum is generated only due to _ misalignments _ of the principal axes of these tensors .",
    "it has been assumed , in many occasions , that these two tensors are largely uncorrelated , the inertia tensor being a local property while the shear tensor is dominated by large - scale structure external to the proto - halo ( e.g. hoffman 1986a , 1988a ; heavens & peacock 1988 ; steinmetz & bartelmann 1995 ; catelan & theuns 1996 ) .",
    "such a lack of correlation would have led to relatively large spins and would have provided a specific statistical framework for ttt . on the other hand ,",
    "a strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 would have led to relatively small spins , and would have invalidated some of the predictions based on the assumption of independence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . moreover",
    ", a correlation of this sort could provide the missing clue for the special characteristics of the lagrangian proto - halo regions @xmath26 , those that will eventually evolve into virialized haloes .",
    "we address the correlation between the principal axes of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at the proto - halo centres of mass by first showing in the probability distributions of the cosines of the angles between them .",
    "the eigenvectors @xmath69 and @xmath70 are labeled in such a way that the corresponding eigenvalues are ranked @xmath71 and @xmath72 , namely the major axes are denoted by 1 and the minor axes by 3 ( and note , for example , that @xmath73 is the direction of maximum compression ) .",
    "coincide with those of @xmath74 , because the difference of the two tensors is a scalar matrix . ]",
    "the highest spike ( near a cosine of unity ) indicates a very strong alignment between the minor axes of the two tensors , and the second - highest spike refers to a strong alignment between the major axes .",
    "the alignment between the intermediate axes is also apparent but somewhat weaker .",
    "the peaks near a cosine of zero indicate a significant tendency for orthogonality between the major axis of one tensor and the minor axis of the other . there is a somewhat weaker orthogonality between the intermediate and minor axes , and the weakest orthogonality is between the major and intermediate axes .",
    "the first two moments of these distributions are @xmath75 and @xmath76 based on the higher - order moments and the number of haloes in the sample , the statistical uncertainty in these mean quantities is between 0.001 and 0.003 , depending on the matrix element considered . in order to estimate the systematic errors due to the finite number of particles in each halo",
    ", we re - measured the moments considering only the haloes containing 1000 particles or more .",
    "the results agree with those dominated by smaller haloes of @xmath77 particles at the level of a few per cent .",
    "for example , we obtain @xmath78 with a typical statistical uncertainty of @xmath79 .",
    "the values of the matrix elements @xmath80 and @xmath81 can be used to quantify the degree of correlation between the shear and inertia tensors .",
    "note that a perfect correlation corresponds to a diagonal , unit matrix both for @xmath82 and @xmath83 , while perfect independence corresponds to all the elements being equal at @xmath84 ( for @xmath82 ) or @xmath85 ( for @xmath83 ) .",
    "note that , by definition , @xmath86 . to characterize the above matrices with single numbers , we define a correlation parameter for @xmath80 by @xmath87 it obtains the values zero and unity for minimum and maximum correlation respectively .",
    "similarly , we define a correlation parameter using @xmath81 , @xmath88 we find in the simulation @xmath89 and @xmath90 , indicating a strong correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 .    we have repeated the above correlation analysis for the two alternative methods of computing the shear tensor described in  4 of paper i. when we minimize smoothing and include only the part of the shear tensor that is generated by fluctuations external to the proto - halo ( _ method 3 _ ) , the correlations are very similar to those obtained with top - hat smoothing , indicating that these are indeed the correlations of physical significance that we are after .",
    "when we minimize smoothing and include the contribution from internal fluctuations ( _ method 2 _ ) , the correlations still show but they get significantly weaker because of the additional noise in the computation of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , our standard way of computing @xmath1 ( _ method 1 _ ) seems to pick up properly the correlation with @xmath0 , and we proceed with it .    note that @xmath1-@xmath0 correlations are unavoidable in the framework of the zeldovich approximation , where a halo consists by the matter that has shell - crossed .",
    "however , the strength of the expected correlations has still to be worked out .",
    "the implication of the @xmath1-@xmath0 alignment is that proto - halo spins are due to small residuals from this correlation .",
    "this means that the haloes acquire significantly less angular momentum than one would have expected based on a simple dimensional analysis that ignores the correlation .",
    "we quantify the effect by a comparison to an artificial case where the alignments are erased . for each halo in our sample",
    ", we randomize the relative directions of the eigenvectors of the inertia and tidal tensors ( by a three - dimensional rotation with random euler angles ) , and then re - compute the angular momentum using . a vast majority of the haloes , about 88 per cent , are found to be associated with a larger spin after the randomization procedure .",
    "the @xmath1@xmath0 correlation is found to reduce the halo spin amplitude with respect to the randomized case by an average factor of @xmath91 , with a comparable scatter of @xmath92 .",
    "this heads towards explaining why haloes have such low values of the dimensionless spin parameter , @xmath93 on average ( barnes & efstathiou 1987 ; bullock 2001b ) , namely a very small rotational energy compared to gravitational or kinetic energy .",
    "the strong correlation between the principal axes of the inertia and tidal tensors promises very interesting implications on galaxy - formation theory .",
    "it indicates that the tidal field plays a key role in determining the locations and shapes of proto - haloes , and therefore may provide a useful tool for identifying proto - haloes in cosmological initial conditions .    as a first step",
    ", we try to gain intuitive understanding of the nature of the correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath0 by inspecting a few proto - haloes and their cross - talk with their cosmological environment . and show a few examples , in regions of the simulation box containing several proto - haloes . in the top panels we show maps of the density and velocity fields at the initial conditions , to indicate some of the qualitative properties of the shear field .",
    "we focus on a section of one plane at at time , and project the velocity field onto it .",
    "the fields are smoothed with a top - hat window corresponding to the typical halo masses shown in that region : in , the smoothing radius is @xmath94 , to match the haloes that contain 100 to 300 particles each , while in it is @xmath95 , to match the haloes of 1000 to 2000 particles . the smoothed density contrast is linearly extrapolated to @xmath59 .",
    "we then introduce , in the bottom panels , the proto - haloes and their inertia tensors .",
    "we present all the proto - haloes whose centres of mass lie within one smoothing length of the plane by showing , in the bottom - left panels , the projection of the proto - halo particle positions onto the plane .",
    "we see a tendency for an association between the proto - halo centres of mass and density peaks smoothed on a halo scale , but this association seems to be far from perfect ( e.g. near the centre of the frame in ) .",
    "note that the single plane shown does not allow an accurate identification of the peak location , and therefore a definite evaluation of the association of proto - haloes and peaks can not be properly addressed by observing these maps . in order to quantify the correlation between proto - haloes and peaks , we identified peaks in the linear density field , smoothed with a top - hat window that contains @xmath67 ( with @xmath67=100 , 1000 and 10000 ) particles , and determined the nearest peak to the centre of mass of each of the proto - haloes that contain @xmath67 ( @xmath96 per cent ) particles .",
    "independently of the halo mass , we find that only @xmath97 per cent of the proto - halo centers lie within one smoothing radius from the nearest peak , and @xmath98 per cent lie within two smoothing radii .",
    "we conclude that while the proto - haloes tend to lie in high density regions , their centres do not coincide with the local density maxima , and in fact the spatial correlation between the two is quite weak .    in the bottom - right panels , we stress the projections of the major axes of the inertia and shear tensors about the centres of mass , and indicate by the length of the line the cosine of the angle between the axis and the plane shown .",
    "note , for example , that the major axes of those haloes in that reside near the centre of the frame and towards the bottom right happen to lie almost perfectly in the plane shown .",
    "all the proto - haloes that show a significant deviation from spherical symmetry have their major inertia axis strongly aligned with the first principal shear axis at their centre of mass .",
    "this alignment reflects the fact that the largest compression flow towards the centre of the proto - halo is along the major inertia axis of the proto - halo .",
    "indeed , this is exactly what is required in order to compress the elongated proto - halo into the more centrally concentrated and quite spherical configuration identified by the halo finder after collapse and virialization .",
    "the detected alignment is a clear manifestation of the crucial role played by the external shear in determining the shape of the lagrangian volume of the proto - halo .",
    "one way to interpret this alignment is as follows .",
    "the compression along the major axis of @xmath1 is associated with a flow of matter from the vicinity into the proto - halo .",
    "this matter comes from relatively large distances and it is therefore responsible for a large inertia moment along this axis in the proto - halo configuration . in contrast , the dilation along the minor axis of @xmath1 causes matter to be tidally stripped , thus leading to a relatively small inertia moment of the proto - halo along this axis .",
    "this picture , in which the boundaries of the proto - halo are fixed by the push and pull of the external mass distribution , is in some sense the opposite of the common wisdom , where the crucial factor is assumed to be the self - gravity attraction .",
    "this other approach , which predicts that collapse first occurs along the minor inertia axis , is based on the simplified model of the collapse of an isolated ellipsoidal perturbation that starts at rest or comoving with the hubble flow ( lin , mestel & shu 1965 ; zeldovich 1965 ) .",
    "snapshots of the evolution of a typical halo ( the same massive halo shown in and ) are shown in . plotted",
    "are the positions at different epochs of the particles that form the halo identified at @xmath59 .",
    "the proto - halo first collapses along its major and intermediate inertia axes , giving rise to an elongated structure made of sub - clumps .",
    "the final halo is then assembled by merging and accretion along the axis of the elongated filament .",
    "this transient sub - halo filament lies along the large - scale filament in which the final halo is embedded ( see and ) .",
    "it indicates that the late stages of halo formation are associated with flows along preferential directions aligned with the cosmic web ( see also colberg 1999 ) .",
    "= 12 cm    it has often been assumed that the boundaries of proto - haloes could be identified with some threshold iso - density contours about density maxima .",
    "( bardeen 1986 ; hoffman 1986b , 1988b ; heavens & peacock 1988 ; catelan & theuns 1996 ) . in this case",
    ", the density distribution in a proto - halo could be approximated by a second - order taylor expansion of the density profile about the peak .",
    "figures [ fig : ex1 ] and [ fig : ex2 ] demonstrate that this assumption is going to fail in most cases shown ( except , perhaps , the halo at the bottom - right of ) . in a typical proto - halo ,",
    "the boundaries are not determined by the self gravity due to the local mass distribution within the proto - halo but rather by the tidal field due to the external mass distribution .",
    "such a proto - halo is typically embedded within a large - scale elongated density ridge , but is not necessarily centred on a local density peak .",
    "the compressions exerted by the void regions surrounding the ridge define the compression axes of the shear tensor in directions perpendicular to the ridge , while the tides from the other parts of the ridge cause large - scale dilation along the ridge .",
    "the associated push and pull of mass along these directions make the large inertia axes of the proto - halo lie perpendicular to the ridge , and the minor inertia axis lie parallel to the ridge .",
    "this understanding should be translated to a practical recipe for identifying the boundaries of proto - haloes . at later stages",
    "we also see an internal compression and merging along the filament , namely the minor inertia axis of the proto - halo .",
    "we continue with a complementary investigation of the properties of proto - haloes , using several different statistics that may , in particular , distinguish them from random gaussian peaks .",
    "first of all , we study the shapes of the proto - haloes in lagrangian space using their inertia tensors .",
    "a complete description of the statistical properties of the eigenvalues of the inertia tensor ( a symmetric , positive definite matrix ) can be obtained in terms of the three following parameters : the trace @xmath99 , the ellipticity @xmath100 , and the prolateness @xmath101 .",
    "a perfect sphere has @xmath102 .",
    "a flat circular disc ( ultimate oblateness ) has @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "a thin filament ( ultimate prolateness ) has @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "thus , @xmath107 measures the deviation from sphericity , and @xmath108 measures the prolateness versus oblateness . in we show the joint distribution of ellipticity and prolateness , and the probability distribution marginalized along each axis , for our proto - haloes at @xmath58 . the boundaries @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 arise from the conditions @xmath112 , @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , respectively . as a consequence ,",
    "the data - points populate only a triangle in the @xmath115 plane , with vertices at @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "this introduces a correlation between @xmath107 and @xmath108 at high ellipticities ( @xmath119 ) .",
    "we find that only 3 per cent of the proto - haloes are nearly spherical , with @xmath120 ( or @xmath121 ) .",
    "most of the proto - haloes , 74 per cent , have moderate but significant ellipticities in the range @xmath122 . a significant fraction , 23 per cent , have extreme ellipticities of @xmath123 ( and almost all are prolate configurations ) .",
    "about 68 per cent of the proto - haloes are prolate , @xmath124 , and about 2.3 per cent are extremely prolate , @xmath125 .",
    "the average and standard deviation for @xmath107 and @xmath108 are @xmath126 and @xmath127 , respectively .",
    "it is pretty surprising to note that , despite the pronounced difference of the proto - halo boundaries from iso - density contours about density peaks , the shape distribution of the two are not very different .",
    "bardeen ( 1986 , section vii ) quote for overdensity patches about @xmath128 peaks : @xmath129 and @xmath130 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively . using their equations 7.7 and 6.17 for @xmath131 peaks , which we found to be more appropriate for proto - haloes , we get @xmath132 and @xmath133 for @xmath107 and @xmath108 respectively .",
    "= 8 cm    in we found that the principal axes of the inertia and tidal ( and deformation ) tensors tend to be aligned , which means that proto - haloes will have their dominant collapse along their major axes of inertia .",
    "we now test whether the shape of the proto - halo is correlated with the relative strength of the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor , i.e. , the compression factors along the principal axes of @xmath134 . rather than @xmath1 because we expect the self gravity of the proto - halo ( described by the diagonal terms of @xmath134 ) to also play a role in shaping it , as in the basic formulation of the zeldovich approximation . ] in , we show the joint distributions of the ratios @xmath135 and @xmath136 between the eigenvalues of the inertia and deformation tensors ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "and @xmath108 parameters used to characterize @xmath0 because the latter are ill - defined for non - positive - definite matrices such as @xmath134 , for which the trace and the single eigenvalues may vanish or be negative . ]",
    "certain correlations are detected for some of these ratios , meaning that the degree of asymmetry between the principal axes of the tidal field plays a role in determining the lagrangian shape of a proto - halo .",
    "for instance , it appears that the ratio @xmath138 is anti - correlated with @xmath139 .",
    "this may be interpreted as another face of the @xmath1-@xmath0 correlation ( ) , where the largest ( smallest ) compression flow in a proto - halo is associated with its major ( minor ) axis of inertia .",
    "for example , when the two largest compression flows are of comparable strength , @xmath140 , the proto - halo configuration is oblate , @xmath141 , namely a large @xmath138 and a small @xmath139 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the compression is mainly along one axis and @xmath142 ( i.e. small @xmath138 ) , the configuration is prolate , @xmath143 ( i.e. large @xmath139 ) .",
    "note that these correlations , much like the @xmath1-@xmath0 correlation , derive from the constraint that the lagrangian region is destined to end up in a virialized halo .",
    "when pancakes or filaments form instead , the expected correlations may be different , with the final minor axis of inertia correlated with the direction of the largest flow of compression , etc . as seen in",
    ", the typical evolution from an initial proto - halo to a final halo indeed passes through an intermediate phase of a pancake ( or a filament ) lying perpendicular to the direction(s ) of first collapse .    back to proto - haloes , it is clear that binary correlations can not tell the full story ; for a complete study one should consider the joint distribution of the three eigenvalues .",
    "other quantities , such as bulk flows , may also influence the shapes of proto - haloes .",
    "therefore , this issue deserves a more detailed study beyond the scope of the current paper , which only provides first clues .    from the dynamical point of view",
    ", proto - haloes can also be classified by the signs of the eigenvalues of the deformation tensor at the centre of mass , indicating whether the initial flows along the principal directions are of compression of dilation .",
    "we find that a small minority of the proto - haloes , about 11 per cent , are contracting along all three principal axes . the vast majority , about 86 per cent , are initially collapsing along two directions and expanding along the third .",
    "only 2.7 per cent are collapsing along one direction and expanding along two .",
    "( and @xmath144 ) into a local contraction . this could be a feature that distinguishes proto - haloes from random patches .",
    "] this clearly distinguishes the centres of mass of proto - haloes from random points in the gaussian field , where the probability of the corresponding dynamical configurations based on the deformation tensor would have been 8 , 42 , and 42 per cent respectively , with the rest 8 per cent expanding along three directions ( doroshkevich 1970 ) .",
    "it also distinguishes the proto - haloes from peaks of the linear density field .",
    "when smoothed with a top - hat window corresponding to 100 particles , we find in our simulation that the probabilities of the three dynamical configurations are 45 , 46 and 8.6 per cent , respectively .",
    "these fractions somewhat depend on the smoothing length . using a top - hat window containing 1000 ( 10000 ) particles ,",
    "the corresponding probabilities become 50 ( 67 ) , 44 ( 30 ) and 5.4 ( 3.4 ) per cent .",
    "the peaks are characterized by compression along three or two directions , while most of the proto - haloes are compressing along two directions .",
    "this finding is consistent with the picture arising from where proto - haloes are typically embedded in elongated , filament - like large - scale structures , surrounded by voids that induce compression flows along the two principal directions orthogonal to the filament .",
    "= 8 cm    = 8 cm    a certain fraction of our proto - haloes are associated , to some degree , with density peaks in the initial conditions . in",
    "we show the distribution of @xmath145 over all the haloes containing more than 100 ( main panel ) or 1000 ( inset ) particles , where @xmath146 is the density contrast at the centre of mass of the proto - halo and @xmath147 is the rms density contrast over all space .",
    "this is compared with the expected distribution of @xmath83 , for random points and for density peaks , in a gaussian random field with the @xmath46cdm power spectrum , smoothed on the scale corresponding to 100 ( main panel ) and 1000 ( inset ) particles of our simulation .",
    "note that our proto - haloes typically correspond to one-@xmath147 fluctuations with a relatively small dispersion .",
    "this distribution can be clearly distinguished from the density distribution in randomly selected density maxima , which average at about @xmath148 , and have extended tails  especially towards high values .",
    "some of the high peaks are embedded in more extended perturbations of @xmath149 .",
    "they give rise to clumps that eventually merge into the larger haloes that we identify today , and they are therefore not included in our sample of proto - haloes . also , recall that the impression from and was that the correlation between the halo centres of mass and the positions of density peaks is quite limited , and therefore the central proto - halo densities tend to be lower than the heights of the associated peaks .",
    "it is also possible that some very high and very low peaks may have deformation configurations that would end up as very aspherical or fragmented structures rather than coherent virialized haloes ( e.g. katz , quinn & gelb 1993 ; van de weygaert & babul 1994 ) .",
    "one often uses the terminology of the spherical collapse model to characterize the evolution of proto - haloes .",
    "for instance , one refers to ` turnaround ' and ` collapse ' time , even though , strictly speaking , these quantities are not well - defined for non - spherical objects ( see , however , the discussion in sugerman 2000 ) .",
    "one way to test our definition of just - collapsed haloes at @xmath59 , and to address the sphericity of proto - haloes , is by evaluating the accuracy with which the spherical collapse model describes their evolution . shows the distribution of the linearly extrapolated density contrast at the proto - halo centre of mass , smoothed on the halo size .",
    "the average of the distribution , @xmath150 , is within @xmath310 per cent of the standard prediction of the spherical collapse model at collapse time , @xmath151 .",
    "this indicates that our halo finding method and the spherical model are consistent on average .",
    "however , the scatter is large , indicating strong deviations from sphericity for many individual proto - haloes , which implies a big uncertainty in the turnaround or collapse times .    what are the proto - haloes that populate the tails of the linear overdensity distribution ?",
    "in particular , how do proto - haloes of @xmath152 manage to make haloes by today ?",
    "it is expected that the presence of shear may speed - up the collapse of a density perturbation with respect to the spherical case ( hoffman 1986b ; zaroubi & hoffman 1993 ; bertschinger & jain 1994 ) .",
    "in fact , our haloes with @xmath152 are indeed characterized by a strong shear .",
    "they typically have @xmath153 and @xmath154 , i.e. they are characterized by compression and dilation factors of similar amplitudes on orthogonal axes . in this case , shear terms in the raychaudhuri equation ( e.g. bertschinger & jain 1994 ) account for significant corrections to the spherical terms , already at @xmath58 . on the other hand , there are high density proto - haloes , @xmath155 , which collapse only today , which is late compared to the predictions of the spherical model",
    "these are generally characterized by strong compression flows along 2 directions and by mild expansion along the third axis .",
    "the reason for their late collapse is not obvious and deserves further investigation which is beyond our scope here .",
    "= 8 cm    had the inertia and shear tensors been _ uncorrelated _ , one could have argued that the direction of the spin in the linear regime should tend to be aligned with the direction of the middle eigenvector of @xmath1 ( and of @xmath0 ) .",
    "the cartesian components of @xmath156 in the frame where @xmath1 is diagonal are @xmath157 where @xmath158 are cyclic permutations of @xmath159 .",
    "we average over all the possible orthogonal matrices @xmath160 that may relate the uncorrelated principal frames of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , while keeping the eigenvalues of the two tensors fixed , and obtain @xmath161 the assumed independence of @xmath1 and @xmath0 would have guaranteed that in the principal frame of @xmath1 the conditional average of @xmath162 ( given the eigenvalues of @xmath0 ) would have been the same for all @xmath163 , namely a certain function @xmath164 . on average ,",
    "the largest component @xmath165 would have been the one for which @xmath166 is the largest , which is necessarily @xmath167 , because by definition @xmath72 .",
    "thus , the angular momentum would have tended to be aligned with @xmath168 . would have also been preferentially aligned with the middle eigenvector of @xmath0 . in this case , however , since all the eigenvalues @xmath169 are positive , one expects a weaker correlation . ] to demonstrate this argument and evaluate the strength of the effect , we use the randomized @xmath1-@xmath0 pairs obtained as described at the end of . in this case , we find @xmath170 ( for @xmath171 ) , with a scatter of @xmath172 about these mean values .",
    "we see that the tendency for alignment with the middle eigenvector is quite significant .",
    "given that the inertia and shear tensors are in fact strongly _ correlated _ ( ) , we now investigate , using ttt , what kind of alignment , if any , one should expect between @xmath173 and @xmath1 at the initial conditions . due to the @xmath8 correlation , the distribution of the orthogonal linear transformations @xmath160 should not be uniform but rather favour rotations with small euler angles .",
    "moreover , since we saw in that different pairs of eigenvectors have different degrees of alignment , the average off - diagonal terms of @xmath0 in the principal frame of @xmath1 would not be all equal anymore",
    ". this could be sufficient for drastically changing the preferential alignment of the angular momentum with @xmath168 seen in the uncorrelated case .",
    "using ttt based on the inertia and tidal tensors for proto - haloes as extracted from the simulation , we actually obtain @xmath174 , with a scatter of @xmath172 in every case .",
    "this shows that the @xmath1-@xmath0 correlation indeed modifies the @xmath173-@xmath1 alignment predicted in the uncorrelated case .",
    "the spin tendency for alignment with @xmath168 is still the strongest , but it is weaker than before . the alignment with @xmath175 becomes stronger and almost comparable to the alignment with @xmath168 , while the alignment with @xmath176 becomes even weaker than it was , namely the spin prefers to be perpendicular to @xmath176 .",
    "we see that , generally speaking , the correlation between @xmath0 and @xmath1 tends to weaken the correlation between @xmath173 and @xmath1 .",
    "next , we measure the actual spins of the proto - haloes in the initial conditions of the simulation , and correlate it with the directions of the eigenvectors of @xmath1 .",
    "the distributions of angles between these vectors are shown in ( top panels ) .",
    "we see that the spin has a weak but significant tendency to be perpendicular to the major axis of @xmath1 , and an even weaker tendency to be parallel either to the middle or to the minor axis of @xmath1 . in this case ,",
    "@xmath177 , in good agreement with the ttt approximation .",
    "thus , contrary to lp00 , we find no evidence for a strong correlation with the direction of the middle axis of @xmath1 .",
    "lp00 have proposed to parametrize @xmath173-@xmath1 correlations through the expression @xmath178 where @xmath179^{1/2}$ ] is the trace - free unit shear tensor , and @xmath180 is the correlation parameter .",
    "systematically lies along one of the principal axes of @xmath1 .",
    "however , since this configuration can not be realized in ttt , we adopt as a plausible parametrization of the correlation . ]",
    "this is particularly convenient for analytical studies of spin statistics ( e.g. crittenden 2001 ) , since it bypasses the ambiguous issue of determining the inertia tensors of proto - haloes and their statistics .",
    "the correlation parameter @xmath180 vanishes if @xmath173 is randomly distributed with respect to @xmath1 , and according to lp00 it should take the value @xmath181 if ttt holds and @xmath1 is independent of @xmath0 ( empirically , we actually get @xmath182 from the randomized sample in our simulation ) .",
    "it is especially interesting to provide an independent measure of @xmath180 from our simulation because has been used in modeling spin - spin correlations ( crittenden 2001 ) and only one determination of @xmath180 is available ( lp00 ) .",
    "the correlation parameter @xmath180 can be evaluated in the principal frame of the tidal tensor . denoting the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of @xmath183 by @xmath184 and @xmath185 , one obtains @xmath186 , where @xmath187 has been used ( lp00 ) . using this expression for @xmath180 , we obtain by averaging over all the proto - haloes in our initial conditions @xmath188 , and",
    "when we restrict ourselves to proto - haloes containing 1000 particles or more we get @xmath189 .",
    "it is worth stressing , however , that the dispersion among the proto - haloes of the quantity that is averaged in the determination of @xmath180 is very large , with an rms value of about @xmath190 , which is not a good property of this statistic .",
    "next , we wish to find out how much of the ( weak ) @xmath191-@xmath1 correlation detected at the initial conditions actually survives the non - linear evolution to the present epoch . for this we plot in the bottom panels of the distributions of angles between the _ final _ spin and the initial shear tensor .",
    "we find that the correlation is strongly weakened .",
    "this is hardly surprising based on the significant non - linear evolution in spin direction found in paper i. we obtain @xmath192 , at variance with the result obtained by lp00 , @xmath193 at @xmath59 , using a low - resolution particle - mesh simulation of an @xmath194 cdm model .",
    "our result persists when considering only the haloes containing 1000 particles or more , @xmath195 .",
    "the discrepancy with lp00 is probably an effect of the higher accuracy with which our high - resolution , adaptive p@xmath45 m code accounts for non - linear effects .",
    "the smoothing length used to define @xmath196 in the simulation could also affect the results ( for instance , smoothing on too small a scale might give unphysically small @xmath197 correlations ) . in order to test the dependence of our findings on the adopted filtering radius , we re - compute @xmath180 using a top - hat window function which contains 8 times the halo mass .",
    "in this case , for haloes with 100 particles or more , we find @xmath198 at z=50 , and @xmath199 at @xmath59 .",
    "this shows that smoothing is not a major issue here .",
    "our result above seems to suggest that observed spin directions , as deduced from disc orientations , can not be used to deduce useful information about the initial shear tensor .",
    "how relevant are our results to the orientation of disc galaxies ? on one hand ,",
    "the haloes in our current analysis are all characterized by a present - day overdensity of @xmath200 , while the galactic discs are associated with much higher density contrasts , so a certain unknown extrapolation is required .",
    "moreover , it is plausible that the plane of today s disc galaxy is determined by the halo spin at an early time , before the gas fell into the disc .",
    "as expected , we see in the simulation that the non - linear effects wipe out the spin - shear correlation in a gradual fashion , e.g. , @xmath201 ( @xmath202 ) at @xmath203 respectively .",
    "therefore , the disc orientation may after all preserve some of the weak correlation with the initial shear field , and this should be true especially for galaxies that formed at high redshift .",
    "on the other hand , we know that the spin and shear are correlated better at high redshift only for the haloes that we selected at @xmath59 , and we do not know whether this is true for the subhaloes which host disc formation at higher redshift .",
    "it is also possible that the statistical orthogonality between the spin and the first principal shear axis is preserved better in specific regions were cosmic flows are particularly cold .",
    "the cold - flow neighborhood of the local group might provide a suitable field for studying such a correlation .",
    "still , we expect only a weak correlation .",
    "in order to deepen our understanding of how tidal torques actually work , we investigated the cross - talk between the main components of the theory using @xmath7 well - resolved haloes extracted from a cosmological @xmath2-body simulation .",
    "we studied the correlation between the proto - halo inertia tensor and the external shear tensor , and between them and the spin direction , and tried to characterize the proto - halo regions in several different ways .",
    "we defined haloes in today s density field using the standard friends - of - friends algorithm , but it would be useful for future work to check robustness to alternative halo finders as well as to different cosmological scenarios .",
    "we found to our surprise that the @xmath1 and @xmath0 tensors are strongly correlated , in the sense that their minor , major and middle principal axes tend to be aligned , in this order .",
    "this means that the angular momentum , which plays such a crucial role in the formation of disc galaxies , is only a residual which arises from the little , @xmath310 per cent deviations from perfect alignment of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath8 correlation induces a weak tendency of the proto - halo spin to be perpendicular to the major axis of @xmath1 ( and @xmath0 ) .",
    "it also slightly weakens the spin tendency to be aligned with the middle axis ( a tendency that would have dominated had @xmath1 and @xmath0 been uncorrelated ) and slightly strengthen its alignment with the minor axis .",
    "however , these correlations , even at the initial conditions , are weak .",
    "furthermore , non - linear changes in spin direction at late times practically erase the memory of the initial shear tensor , and therefore observed spin directions can not serve as very useful indicators for the initial shear tensor ( again , in variance with lp00 ) .",
    "the only partial caveat is that today s discs may reflect the halo spin directions at some high redshift , which may still preserve some weak correlation with the linear shear field .",
    "a study of this effect would require a high - resolution simulation in which a detailed galaxy formation scheme is incorporated .",
    "on the other hand , the strong @xmath8 correlation provides a promising hint for how to make progress in a long - standing open question in galaxy formation theory .",
    "that is , how to characterize proto - haloes and their boundaries .",
    "speculations based on iso - density or iso - potential contours about high - density peaks have failed the tests of simulations .",
    "we first realize that the centres of proto - haloes tend to lie in @xmath4 over - density regions , but their association with the linear density maxima smoothed on galactic scales is quite limited .",
    "we find that the proto - haloes tend to be elongated along the direction of maximum compression of the smoothed velocity field .",
    "a typical configuration is of an elongated proto - halo lying perpendicular to an elongated background density ridge , with neighboring voids inducing the compression along the major and intermediate inertia axes .",
    "the @xmath8 correlation detected here should thus enable the construction of a detailed algorithm to identify proto - haloes and their boundaries in cosmological initial conditions ( porciani , dekel & hoffman , in preparation ) .",
    "the collapse proceeds in two succesive stages , corresponding to the quasi - linear and the non - linear regimes .",
    "the first stage is characterized by a two dimensional collapse in the plane defined by the major and intermediate inertia axes .",
    "this leads to the formation of a transient clumpy elongated structure aligned with the large scale filament within which the halo resides . in the fully non - linear regime",
    "the proto - halo experiences a one - dimensional collapse and a series of merger of the sub - clumps along the filament , leading to a quasi - spherical object in virial equilibrium .    the proto - haloes can be characterized by a variety of other statistics , which may distinguish them from over - density patches about random density peaks . in terms of shape ,",
    "most proto - haloes have significant ellipticities and most of them are prolate , but this does not distinguish them very clearly from over - density patches about peaks .",
    "in contrast with the strong alignment of the inertia and deformation tensors , there are only weak correlations between the triaxiality of the inertia tensor and that of the deformation tensor , as expressed by ratios of eigenvalues .",
    "the vast majority of proto - haloes are initially collapsing along two principal directions ( except when the self gravity is also considered , inducing a collapse in all directions ) .",
    "this is in clear contrast with the behaviour of density peaks , which have similar probabilities to collapse along three or two axes .",
    "our finding is consistent with proto - haloes being embedded in large - scale filaments surrounded by voids .",
    "the smoothed central densities in proto - haloes typically represent @xmath131 positive perturbations , but with smaller dispersion than for general peaks .",
    "this is partly because the proto - halo centers are only weakly correlated with the density peaks , and also because some of the high peaks lead to clumps that later merge into the big haloes we identify today and include in our sample . despite the significant asphericity",
    ", the proto - halo densities agree on average with the predictions of the spherical collapse model , but the scatter is large .",
    "for example , there are proto - haloes with @xmath152 ( with @xmath146 the density contrast smoothed on the halo scale and linearly estrapolated to today ) , whose collapse is boosted by strong shear of large compression and dilation factors .    in paper",
    "i , we evaluated the performance of linear ttt in predicting the spin of galactic haloes .",
    "we found that , for a given proto - halo at the initial conditions , ttt provides a successful order - of - magnitude estimate of the final halo spin amplitude .",
    "the ttt prediction matches on average the spin amplitude of today s virialized haloes if linear ttt growth is assumed until about @xmath204 .",
    "this makes ttt useful for studying certain aspects of galaxy formation , such as the origin of a universal spin profile in haloes ( bullock 2001b ; dekel 2001 ) , but only at the level of average properties , because the random error is comparable with the signal itself .",
    "we also found in paper i that non - linear evolution causes significant variations in spin direction , which limit the accuracy of the ttt predictions to a mean error of @xmath205 .",
    "furthermore , spatial spin - spin correlations on scales @xmath206 are strongly weakened by non - linear effects .",
    "this limits the usefulness of ttt in predicting intrinsic galaxy alignments in the context of weak gravitational lensing ( catelan 2001 ; crittenden 2001 )",
    ". this situation may improve ( as in the case of the spin - shear correlation addressed in the current paper ) if the orientations of today s discs were determined by the halo spins at a very high redshift , which are better modelled by ttt .",
    "on the other hand , we know this only for the haloes that we selected at @xmath59 , and we do nt know whether this is true for the subhaloes which host disc formation at higher redshift .    in our studies of the cross - talk between the different components of ttt , we have also realized another surprise that leads to a revision in the standard scaling relation of ttt ( white 1984 ) .",
    "it is demonstrated in paper iii that the off - diagonal , tidal terms of the deformation tensor , which drive the torque , are only weakly correlated with the diagonal terms , which determine the overdensity at the proto - halo centre .",
    "the latter enters the ttt scaling relation via the expected collapse time of the proto - halo , and the lack of correlation with the torque leads to a modification in the scaling relation .",
    "the revised scaling relation can be applied shell by shell in order to explain the origin of the universal angular - momentum profile of haloes ( bullock 2001b ; dekel 2001 ) .",
    "it can also be very useful in incorporating spin in semi - analytic models of galaxy formation ( maller , dekel & somerville 2002 ) .",
