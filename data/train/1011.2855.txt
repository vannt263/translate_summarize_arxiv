    "is provided by the leading - order tomozawa - weinberg vector term of the chiral effective lagrangian which , in born approximation , yields a moderately attractive @xmath1 nuclear potential @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the nuclear density , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 mev is the pion decay constant .",
    "this attraction is doubled , roughly , within chirally based coupled - channel @xmath8@xmath14@xmath15 calculations which provide also for a strong absorptivity @xcite .",
    "shallower potentials , @xmath16(4060 ) mev at threshold , are obtained by requiring that the in - medium @xmath17 @xmath18 matrix is derived self - consistently with the potential @xmath19 it generates @xcite .",
    "in contrast , comprehensive global fits to @xmath1-atom strong - interaction shifts and widths yield very deep density dependent @xmath1 nuclear potentials at threshold , in the range @xmath5(150200 ) mev @xcite . in this letter",
    "we discuss recent finuda measurements that might bear on this issue by providing constraints on how deep @xmath20 is at threshold .    in the preceding letter @xcite , the finuda collaboration at da@xmath21ne , frascati , reported on @xmath22-hypernuclear excitation spectra taken in the @xmath23 reaction on several @xmath2-shell nuclear targets .",
    "formation rates were given per stopped @xmath1 for bound states and for low lying continuum states .",
    "in @xmath24 the bound state formation rates agree nicely with a previous kek measurement @xcite .",
    "the recent finuda data allow for the first time to consider the @xmath4 dependence of the formation rates in detail within the nuclear @xmath2 shell where nuclear structure effects may be reliably separated out .",
    "it is our purpose in this companion letter to apply one s knowledge of the nuclear structure aspect of the problem in order to extract the dynamical contents of the measured formation rates , particularly that part which concerns the @xmath1 nuclear dynamics at threshold . in doing",
    "so we transform the partial formation rates reported for well defined and spectroscopically sound final @xmath22 hypernuclear states into @xmath0 hypernuclear formation rates that allow direct comparison with dwia calculations .    the expression for the formation rate of hypernuclear final state @xmath25 in capture at rest on target g.s .",

    "the sensitivity of the dwia amplitude eq .",
    "( [ eq : dw ] ) to @xmath9 arises from the interference of @xmath35 with the pion oscillatory distorted wave @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , once @xmath9 is sufficiently deep to provide a strong - interaction bound state for a given @xmath36 , the atomic @xmath35 also becomes oscillatory within the nucleus which magnifies the effects of interference , as verified in past dwia calculations @xcite .",
    "in this letter we point out another strong sensitivity to the initial - state @xmath1 nuclear dynamics arising from the energy and density dependence of the @xmath27 br .",
    "we show how to incorporate this energy and density dependence into the calculation of a properly averaged value @xmath37 which depends on the @xmath1 atomic orbit through @xmath36 and on the mass number @xmath4 of the target .",
    "the resulting calculated @xmath0 formation rates are then compared to those derived from the finuda data and conclusions are made on the deep vs. shallow @xmath1 nuclear potential issue .",
    "the finuda spectra show distinct peaks for several @xmath0 and @xmath38 states in the nuclear @xmath2 shell . in general ,",
    "the derivation of the @xmath38 formation rate is ambiguous given that the @xmath38 formation strength is often obscured by a rising @xmath22 continuum . in @xmath39 and in @xmath40 it is also mixed with a substantial part of the @xmath0 formation strength owing particularly to high lying @xmath41 parent states in the corresponding core nuclei .",
