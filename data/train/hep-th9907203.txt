    "moreover , it was recently suggested that if the standard model particles are localized on a set of @xmath8-branes where @xmath9 whereas gravity lives in higher dimensional spacetime , then the string scale can be as low as a few tev @xcite .",
    "type i string theory provides a natural framework to realize this `` brane world '' scenario @xcite . in view of these developments , it is therefore important to carry out similar analysis for type i string vacua .",
    "anomaly cancelations in some four - dimensional @xmath7 type i string models were studied in some recent papers @xcite .",
    "anomaly cancelations in @xmath10 type iib @xmath11 orientifolds without the b - flux background were studied in @xcite .",
    "the analysis involves techniques in computing couplings of the twisted moduli with the gauge fields which were also recently studied in @xcite .",
    "these simple examples illustrate some new features in type i string vacua that are distinct from that of the perturbative heterotic string .",
    "first , the r - r scalars which participate in the green - schwarz mechanism come from the twisted sectors which can couple differently to different gauge factors .",
    "therefore , in contrast to perturbative heterotic string , there can be more than one anomalous @xmath6 in these type i vacua",

    "the positions of the branes cease to commute in the presence of a b - field background .",

    "the residual gauge symmetries are typically too large for the models to be phenomenologically interesting . since the rank of the gauge group is reduced by @xmath4 in the presence of b - field , it is possible to construct string models containing the standard model with fewer additional gauge symmetries .",

    "the fact that there are two families in the @xmath25 sector depends crucially on the multiplicity of @xmath26 in the @xmath25 sector .",
    "since the main new features in models with non - zero b - field that we discuss here already appear in six dimensions , we will focus our attention to six - dimensional models in this paper .",
    "moreover , as we will see , anomaly cancelations in six dimensions provide rather stringent constraints on the consistencies of these models .",
