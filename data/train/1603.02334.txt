    "we review the recent work on the intercalation chemistry of iron chalcogenide superconductors . given that they exhibit zero resistance for electrical currents below a critical temperature ( @xmath1 ) ,",
    "superconductors hold great promise in our future energy needs.@xcite furthermore , superconductors have been proposed for devices that stabilize the electrical power grid by storing energy mechanically in flywheels or electromagnetically in toroidal magnets.@xcite much as previously known superconducting materials , the iron - based compounds have a role to play in our future energy needs.@xcite    the iron chalcogenide superconductors remain topical due to their versatile solid state chemistry that allows new materials to be discovered and their ability to be isolated as single layers .",
    "furthermore , the highest @xmath1 so far observed in any iron - based system has been in single layered fese where reports vary from 65 k to 100 k.@xcite just like the high-@xmath1 cuprates , the iron - based systems appear to be unconventional in their superconducting mechanism@xcite and this raises more hope that solid state chemists will continue to make significant discoveries in this field .",
    "although similar in many respects to the iron - based pnictides , the chalcogenides do show considerable differences in their physical and chemical properties . while the arsenide phases are held together by ionic forces between the cationic layers , @xmath2 ( lao)@xmath3 and ba@xmath4 , and the anionic ( feas)@xmath5 layers , the chalcogenides can be held by van der waals interactions alone .",
    "these comparatively weaker interactions make the fe@xmath6 layers , where @xmath7s@xmath8 and se@xmath8 , ideal hosts for intercalation chemistry such as alkali metal insertion along with various other types of guest species such as ammonia .",
    "since the pnictides do not express intercalation chemistry , we have left them out altogether in this review .",
    "the reader curious about the major differences between chalcogenides and pnictide superconductors can find several reviews written on these two major categories.@xcite    we review the chemical techniques for inserting ionic and molecular species into fe@xmath6 hosts and their resulting physical properties .",
    "an example of the different layered structures we will be reviewing and their intercalation chemistry is presented in the schematic of figure [ fig_intro ] .",
    "we will examine three major methods for intercalating guest species , or _ intercalates _",
    ", which include insertion of 1 . )",
    "electropositive metals in liquid ammonia , 2 . ) metals and organic amines , and 3 . )",
    "extended hydroxides through hydrothermal conditions .",
    "each method plus post - synthetic treatment can lead to guest - host compounds with different structures as shown in figure [ fig_intro ] .    before presenting the latest studies on the intercalation of iron - based materials , we briefly review the history of intercalation chemistry of superconductors such as c@xmath9 and metal dichalcogenides .",
    "it is also instructive to present the crystal chemistry and physical properties of the simple binary iron chalcogenides  fes , fese , and fete , which act as the hosts .",
    "the main goals of such chemistry has been to both prepare new compounds and ultimately control the physical properties of the binary compounds in order to discover the underlying mechanism for superconductivity .",
    "we believe the reader will recognize , however , that this chemistry has broader implications than superconductivity and could represent a new area for the preparation of two - dimensional ( 2d ) inorganic materials .",
    "this year , 2016 , is a leap year since february has an extra day .",
    "such an insertion of a day into the calendar is known as an intercalation , and chemistry has borrowed this term to analogously describe the expansion in a solid upon inserting a foreign species .",
    "intercalation chemistry in inorganic materials has a long history,@xcite and its applications range from electrochemical energy storage@xcite to the sequestration of waste material in layered clays or sulfides.@xcite it is useful to briefly review the terminology in this field and some of the work done on past superconductors .",
    "like closely related interstitial compounds,@xcite intercalation compounds are inorganic solids in which guest species such as ions or molecules occupy open crystallographic sites of the host . unlike interstitial compounds , however , intercalation hosts usually consist of structural elements such as chains and layers that are held together by weak forces such as those of the van der waals type .",
    "the guest species , or _ intercalate _ can cause the unit cell of the host to expand upon insertion but it should not change the crystal structure significantly . furthermore , the intercalation and de - intercalation processes should be reversible and possible at temperatures lower than those typical of solid state reactions so that no major rearrangement of the host s structure occurs .    given the constraints of the intercalation processes , two dimensional ( 2d ) materials are the most common hosts.@xcite materials with one - dimensional ( 1d ) motifs can facilitate exit and entry of guest species but also undergo major re - organization upon intercalation .",
    "conversely , three - dimensional ( 3d ) materials retain their structural integrity but impede facile intercalation of guests .",
    "classic inorganic solids in the 2d category include layered materials such as graphite,@xcite graphite oxide,@xcite and montmorillonite  a silicate clay.@xcite if the host is redox active , then the intercalation process is either reductive or oxidative , and this special property has been explored in electrochemical devices such as rechargeable batteries.@xcite    in order to raise some key questions from the literature on iron chalcogenides , we briefly discuss three other inorganic hosts that enhance their superconducting properties upon intercalation .",
    "these include the layered metal dichalcogenides , layered cobaltates , and three - dimensional fullerene crystals .",
    "these cases present to us the importance of charge doping , lewis acid - base chemistry , and structure - property relationships on superconductivity , and guide our understanding of iron chalcogenide intercalation chemistry .",

    "metal dichalcogenides are redox active hosts with a van der waals gap between the layers that allows facile intercalation.@xcite furthermore , they are semiconducting , which aids in the insertion and removal of cations by conducting charge - compensating carriers ( _ i.e. _ electrons and/or holes ) . in the early 1970 s , several groups demonstrated that upon intercalation , the superconducting critical temperature , or @xmath1 , could be raised in dichalcogenides such as tas@xmath12 and nbse@xmath12.@xcite in particular , the work of geballe et al .",
    "demonstrated how a large array of organic and inorganic hosts could act as lewis bases , or electron donors , and therefore easily intercalate into the layered materials that act as lewis acids.@xcite the layered hosts can accept lewis bases such as ammonia , pyridine , or even amides with long aliphatic chains such as stearamide . since the metal dichalcogenides act as lewis acids , the @xmath1 s of the final adducts were related to relevant parameters such as interlayer spacing and the @xmath13 s of the lewis bases .",
    "lerf has raised doubts , however , whether lewis acid - base chemistry truly drives the intercalation process in dichalcogenides.@xcite the chief objection from lerf concerns the findings from crystallographic studies showing that the orientation of the nh@xmath11 molecule within the layers is such that its 3-fold axis is oriented along the layers as opposed to perpendicular to them as shown in figure [ fig_nh3-tas2 ] for the case of tas@xmath12.@xcite similarly , the 2-fold axis of the pyridine ring is oriented parallel to the dichalcogenide layers.@xcite this would imply that the lone pair on the nitrogen atom is not oriented towards the layers and is therefore ineffective as a lewis base .    besides the electron donating properties upon intercalation , structure - property relationships are also important .",
    "the common structural motif is the 2d layer formed by infinite edge - sharing @xmath14 polyhedra where @xmath15 = transition metal and @xmath6 = s , se , and te .",
    "polytypism , is common in these materials , since the coordination of the transition metal can be either octahedral or trigonal prismatic due to changes in the ion stacking sequence along the interlayer direction ( figure [ fig_nh3-tas2 ] ) .",
    "however , only when the metal is in trigonal prismatic coordination has superconductivity been observed.@xcite in their studies of 50 different intercalates of various sizes for tas@xmath12 , which increased the interlayer spacing anywhere between 3  to 52  , gamble et al",
    ". found the @xmath1 bears little correlation to interlayer spacing.@xcite instead , they attributed any enhancement in @xmath1 to the efficacy of charge transfer from the intercalate to the host .",
    "alkali metals can also be intercalated into dichalcogenide hosts , either in a liquid ammonia solution or electrochemically , which allows for a more direct measure of electron doping than the lewis basicity of amines.@xcite furthermore , schllhorn,@xcite colombet,@xcite and others@xcite have argued that the intercalation of amines actually occurs through the oxidation of such species so that the true nature of the intercalates is the amine plus its conjugate acid ( _ e.g. _ nh@xmath11 and nh@xmath16 ) , which would also charge dope the dichalcogenide host .",
    "the formation of cationic intercalates , in fact , has been suggested as the driving force for the intercalation of such species into the host.@xcite once the cationic form of the amines has been inserted , the other amines orient themselves in such a way to direct the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen atoms towards the cations .",

    "a more recent example of intercalation chemistry than that of the dichalcogenides includes the layered na@xmath17coo@xmath12 materials.@xcite these cobalt oxides consists of coo@xmath18 octahedra that edge - share to form layers of the brucite - type structure .",
    "na and li cations can fill in the interstitial positions in between and the shuttling of these cations has made the cobaltates an important cathode material for li - rechargeable batteries.@xcite in the sodium intercalated case , when the right amount of na@xmath3 is present along with water molecules , superconductivity is induced .",
    "interestingly , the anhydrous case is non - superconducting , and the highest @xmath1 of 4.5 k is found for the stoichiometry of na@xmath19coo@xmath12 @xmath10 1.3 h@xmath12o ( see figure [ fig_na - coo2]).@xcite at values for @xmath20 greater than @xmath21 , anhydrous na@xmath17coo@xmath12 can exhibit various ordered states for its charge and spin degrees of freedom.@xcite these structures , much like the metal dichalcogenides , demonstrate that they can can accommodate more than one type of guest simultaneously , and that this can be advantageous for superconductivity .",
    "another historical example is that of the intercalated fullerenes . just as graphite",
    "can be easily intercalated,@xcite the molecular allotrope of carbon , c@xmath9 can also accommodate metal cations within its interstices . in the 1990 s",
    ", researchers found that when fullerenes are charge - doped to become fullerides , they are tuned from semiconducting materials to metals and superconductors.@xcite the molecular nature of the crystal and the relatively weak interaction between the c@xmath9 ` hard spheres ' make intercalation possible not only for alkali metals but also molecular species such as ammonia.@xcite a notable difference in the intercalation chemistry of c@xmath9 and graphite is the former s preference for reductive intercalation whereas graphite can undergo both oxidative and reductive insertion.@xcite remarkably , the intercalated fullerenes such as k@xmath11c@xmath9 , rb@xmath11c@xmath9 , and rb@xmath12csc@xmath9 exhibit relatively high @xmath1 s , up to 32 k.@xcite .",
    "the historical examples given above illustrate some of the key factors to consider for the iron - based superconductors .",
    "these considerations include the role of the intercalate in charge doping into the density of states near the fermi level , distorting the relevant structural parameters , and changing the dimensional nature of the fermi surface .",
    "nevertheless , all of these examples are classified as conventional superconductors whose underlying physics is satisfactorily described by bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory.@xcite therefore not all lessons learned from these studies will apply to the iron - based materials .",
    "before discussing the intercalation chemistry of the iron based superconductors , it is instructive to describe the structure , bonding , and electronic properties of the host materials .",
    "the fe@xmath6 ( @xmath6=s , se , te ) layers , like the transition metal dichalcogenides , are held by weak van der waals forces that make them susceptible to intercalation . in the case of the iron telluride , however , the van der waals gap is too small on account of the large anionic radius of te@xmath8 ( 2.21 ),@xcite and this hinders any significant intercalation chemistry .",
    "therefore , this review is focused on the selenides and sulfides , but we do present the electronic and physical properties of fe@xmath22te ( where @xmath20 represents excess iron ) briefly in order to compare and contrast with those of fes and fese .     with the anti - pbo type structure .",
    "setting 2 for the origin is represented for this tetragonal space group .",
    "the dashed line represents the unit cell , and @xmath23 is the so - called anion height . ]",
    "although many binary iron sulfides and selenide phases are known , we are only interested in those that crystallize in the anti - pbo type structure .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig_fech ] , the structure is described by the tetragonal space group @xmath24 ( no .",
    "129 ) , which has two settings . in setting 1 ,",
    "the iron atoms are located at the origin of the cell while in setting 2 the origin is located at the center of inversion symmetry with the iron atoms displaced ( @xmath25,@xmath26 , 0 ) from the origin.@xcite figure [ fig_fech ] shows setting 2 .",
    "either way , the site symmetries of the atoms are such that the fe cations have @xmath27 site symmetry and the @xmath28 anions @xmath29 symmetry . furthermore , the @xmath30-glide normal to the @xmath31-axis leads to the adjacent layers being staggered by ( @xmath32 ) in the @xmath33-plane , which maximizes the distance between the @xmath28 anions . in the resulting two - dimensional square lattice of fe cations ,",
    "each square is capped by a chalcogenide anion , either above or below , which leads to tetrahedral coordination for each iron cation .",
    "the only crystallographic parameters that can be manipulated include the lattice constants and the @xmath6 anion @xmath23-parameter , also know as the anion height from the iron square lattice .",
    "these two parameters in addition to the lattice constants are therefore enough to describe important properties such as fe  se bond distances , fe  fe distances , which influence the @xmath34-orbital dispersion bands , and the @xmath6fe@xmath6 bond angle .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig_structrends ] , the anion height and the variance of the tetrahedral bond angle both correlate with @xmath1 across the various iron - based superconductor families.@xcite    structurally , the layered iron chalcogenides provide a nice contrast to the transition metal dichalcogenides . the former is composed of a square planar lattice of @xmath34-block metals whereas the latter is composed of a hexagonal array . in the iron - based chalcogenides ,",
    "2d layers consist of edge - sharing tetrahedra ( figure [ fig_fech ] ) whereas in the dichalcogenides @xmath14 trigonal prisms or octahedra complete the layers .",
    "these two structural distinctions lead to differences in both the local electronic properties determined by crystal field splitting considerations and to the long - range electronic properties determined by the band structures .     with the anion height parameter for various members of the iron arsenide and chalcogenide superconductors .",

    ", it is likely that the larger particle sizes and therefore samples with smaller surface areas have a higher barrier towards conversion of tetragonal fes to one of its thermodynamically stable phases .",
    "fes is typically prepared by solution routes either under ambient conditions@xcite or hydrothermally.@xcite as a polycrystalline material , mackinawite can be prepared by oxidation of iron metal in an acetic acid / acetate buffer solution .",

    "lennie et al . have argued that mackinawite is kinetically stabilized and transforms to other phases only through oxidation or further sulfurization.@xcite    studies on the physical properties of mackinawite fes have been inconsistent with some studies reporting a semiconducting ground state@xcite and others superconductivity.@xcite nanocrystalline fes , prepared by the crystallization of an amorphous black solid through a solvothermal method , was found to be semiconducting and ferrimagnetic.@xcite likewise denholme et al .",

    "likewise , borg et al . demonstrated that single crystals of k@xmath17fe@xmath44s@xmath12 could be de - intercalated hydrothermally to prepare single crystals of fes.@xcite the key to obtaining superconducting crystals was to maintain the solution under basic conditions and to provide enough iron powder during the hydrothermal synthesis in order to fill in the vacancies in the k@xmath17fe@xmath44s@xmath12 samples .",

    "the fermi surface of fes and fese show several separate sets of bands : one set is zone - centered and are hole carrying , and the other set is corner - centered and electron carrying.@xcite the dispersion curves reveal that these bands consist of the various fe @xmath34-orbitals while the @xmath6 @xmath46-orbitals are buried deep in energy . according to a recent arpes study of fese , the bands around the zone center consist largely of the @xmath47 and @xmath48 orbitals , which are degenerate in the tetragonal phase , but split upon the orthorhombic distortion near 90 k.@xcite the electron pocket meanwhile is dominated by the @xmath49 orbital . from their arpes study on high quality crystals , watson et al .",

    "perhaps not coincidentally , a reliable structural descriptor for the @xmath1 in iron - based superconductors is the closeness of the tetrahedral bond angles to the ideal 109.5@xmath57 , with the highest observed for the arsenide family being @xmath1 ( figure [ fig_structrends]b ) .",

    "d distance was approximately 3.03 .@xcite    the intercalation chemistry of fese also has similarities with the superconducting fullerenes ( see section [ fullerenes ] ) .",
    "the amount of charge doping in both sets of materials seems to be critical to raising the @xmath1 . in the case of intercalated fullerenes , the alkali metals such as potassium electron dope the conduction band and",
    "since this band is narrow , the density of states at the fermi level is high .",
    "similarly , fese requires a certain amount of charge doping at the fermi level to enhance its superconducting properties . unlike the doped fullerenes ,",
    "however , the iron chalcogenides are multi - band superconductors where the fermi surface has both hole and electron pockets instead of just one conduction band .",
    "the nesting of these multiple bands seems to be critical in the case of fese .",
    "even if the maximum @xmath1 has been achieved in fese , there remain multiple future directions for this field .",
    "one , the orientation of the of the organic amines intercalates in fese has not been solved nor the nature of the guest species after intercalation . in other words , are the organic amines neutral or their conjugate bases upon intercalation ?",
    "this question is important to establish the correct electron doping for optimal superconducting properties , which could help answer the question as to the mechanism for such a high @xmath1 .",
    "the coordination of the organic amines , _",
    "e.g. _ pyridine and ethylenediamine , could also be solved in order to determine the importance of hydrogen bonding and the intercalated cations in stabilizing these compounds .",
    "the work of kovnir et al . in the intercalation of structurally related iron selenides with intercalated organic amines demonstrates how this problem could be solved from advanced diffraction techniques.@xcite    another set of opportunities in this field is to explore beyond fese .",
    "the intercalation chemistry of mackinawite fes , for example , has not been fully explored . since it has just been found to be superconducting at 5 k",
    ", there exists an opportunity to discover higher @xmath1 sulfides .",
    "finally , other metals besides iron could be investigated such as cobalt , nickel , and copper , which have similar chalcogenide chemistry to iron .",
    "these new intercalated transition metal monochalcogenides could represent a new area of materials chemistry in a similar fashion to the transition metal dichalcogenides .",
