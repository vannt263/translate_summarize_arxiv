    "psr j0108@xmath11431 was discovered by tauris et al .",
    "( 1994 ) during observations performed as a part of the parkes southern pulsar survey ( manchester et al .",
    "1996 ) . with a period @xmath13 s and a period derivative @xmath14 s  s@xmath10 ( damico et al .",
    "1998 ) , the pulsar has a characteristic age @xmath15 myr , rotation energy loss rate @xmath16 erg s@xmath10 , and magnetic field @xmath17 g. the dispersion measure of @xmath18 @xmath19  pc ( damico et al .",
    "1998 ) , the lowest observed so far for a radio pulsar , puts  at a distance of about 130 pc , estimated according to the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model for the galactic electron density distribution .",
    "tauris et al .  (",
    "1994 ) suggest that the local electron density may be greater than average in this direction , giving a distance as low as 60 pc .",
    "regardless of the exact value , the small distance to psr j0108@xmath11431 implies a radio luminosity a factor @xmath20 smaller than the average for other old pulsars of similar ages .",
    "this pulsar could thus be representative of a population of sub - luminous radio pulsars ( e.g. , dewey et al .",
    "1985 ) .",
    "since   is apparently the closest known pulsar , it is a natural candidate for observations in other wavelength bands .",
    "however , it has not yet been detected outside the radio range .",
    "presumably too faint to be detected in the _ rosat _ all sky survey ,  has not been observed in a pointing mode with an x - ray observatory so far .",
    "the field was observed with the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) , but the pulsar was not detected ( korpela & bowyer 1998 ) . in the mid - infrared , observations with the _ infrared space observatory _ were performed to search for a disk around the pulsar but with no conclusive result ( koch - miramond et al .",
    "particularly interesting would be the detection of optical - uv thermal radiation from the neutron star ( ns ) surface to examine various heating mechanisms that can operate in the ns interiors .",
    "according to the current models ( see , e.g. , tsuruta 1998 , for a review ) , by the age of 170 myr a ns would have cooled down to very low ( surface ) temperatures , @xmath21 k , and its thermal radiation would be virtually undetectable unless some ( re)heating mechanisms operate .    amongst several proposed heating mechanisms , two are most efficient in slowly rotating pulsars .",
    "the first one is the dissipation of energy of differential rotation .",
    "as invoked by models of pulsar glitches , the interior neutron superfluid rotates more rapidly than the outer solid crust .",
    "frictional interaction with the crust dissipates the energy of the differential rotation , heating the star ( shibazaki & lamb 1989 ; umeda et al .",
    "1993 ; van riper et al .  1994 ; larson & link 1999 ) .",
    "the amount of heat released depends on the differential angular momentum @xmath22 of the frictionally coupled superfluid layers .",
    "for instance , at an age @xmath23 myr , plausible values of @xmath24 can provide @xmath25@xmath26 k , depending on the equation of state of the ns interiors and properties of nucleon superfluidity .",
    "the other heating mechanism is joule heating caused by dissipation of the magnetic field in the ns crust . according to miralles , urpin & konenkov ( 1998 ) , the ns luminosity at @xmath27 10 myr is approximately equal to the energy released due to the field dissipation . at this stage ,",
    "the surface temperature decreases slowly , being comparable to that produced by the frictional heating at @xmath28 myr .    thus , if the heating mechanisms indeed operate , one can expect the surface ns temperature of a few times @xmath29  k , which would be detectable in the optical - uv range but undetectable in x - rays , traditionally used for observations of thermal radiation from nss .",
    "it is also possible that the pulsar emits nonthermal optical radiation .",
    "so far , this has only been firmly detected from younger pulsars ( e.g. , the vela pulsar  mignani & caraveo 2001 ; psr b0656 + 14  koptsevich et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the only previous observations of   in the optical range ( @xmath3,@xmath2,@xmath30,@xmath31 bands ) were carried out with the 6-m telescope of special astrophysical observatory ( russia ) , but they were not deep enough to detect the pulsar and provide useful constraints on the radiation mechanisms ( kurt et al .",
    "therefore , we performed a deep observation of the pulsar field with one of the eso very large telescopes ( vlt ) units in several passbands .",
    "the most recent published coordinates of psr j0108@xmath11431 ( damico et al .",
    "1998 ) were derived from timing data obtained in the interval 1993 april to 1996 june , giving a mean epoch of 1994.9 .",
    "therefore , our knowledge of the actual position of the pulsar at the epoch of our vlt observations is affected by a significant uncertainty due to its unknown proper motion . a pulsar distance of 130 pc and a transverse velocity of 400 km s@xmath10 , a typical value for a radio pulsar ( lorimer , bailes & harrison 1997 ) , give a proper motion of @xmath32 yr@xmath10 .",
    "for the epoch of our vlt observations ( 2000.6 ) , such a proper motion would imply a displacement in an unknown direction of @xmath33 with respect to the original radio timing position .",
    "this obviously makes impossible a straightforward positional search for the optical counterpart . for this reason , we observed the pulsar with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) to obtain a radio position at an epoch close to that of our optical observations and to measure the pulsar s proper motion .",
    "we describe the radio and optical observations in  2 , while the results and their implications are presented and discussed in  3 and  4 , respectively .",
    "the pulsar field was observed using the atca , a 6-km east - west synthesis array consisting of six 22m - diameter antennas , on 2001 march 31 for 11.3 hours .",
    "data were obtained in two bands , each with dual polarization and bandwidth of 128 mhz , centered on 1384 mhz and 2496 mhz , respectively .",
    "the flux density scale was calibrated using a short observation of the standard source 1934 - 638 .",
    "two phase calibrators , 0048 - 097 and 0114 - 211 , were each observed for 2 min every 30 min to establish the position reference frame .",
    "each of these calibrators has positional uncertainties of @xmath34 in the nrao vla calibrator list .",
    "pulsar - gating mode was used , giving 32 phase bins across the pulsar period at both frequencies .",
    "the 128-mhz bandwidth at each frequency was also split into 32 channels allowing removal of dispersive delays during processing .",
    "data were processed using standard techniques with the analysis package miriad .",
    "use of pulsar binning allowed images to be made using on - pulse minus off - pulse difference visibility data .",
    "this removed essentially all artifacts from the images , allowing clear identification of the pulsar in both bands .",
    "positions were derived by fitting to the peak of the source , at 1384 mhz and , separately for calibration with each phase calibrator , at 2496 mhz .",
    "optical observations of the field of psr j0108@xmath11431 were performed in service mode in july and august 2000 with the 8.2-meter antu telescope of the eso vlt , located at the paranal observatory ( chile ) .",
    "the images were obtained using the focal reducer and spectrograph 1 ( fors1 ) instrument , a four - port @xmath35 ccd detector which can be used both as a high / low resolution spectrograph and an imaging camera .",
    "the instrument was operated in imaging mode at its standard angular resolution of 02 per pixel , with a corresponding field of view of @xmath36 .",
    "we chose to sacrifice the angular resolution in favor of a larger field of view to increase the number of reference stars needed for a precise ccd astrometry ( see  2.3 ) .",
    "the images were taken in the bessel filters @xmath4 ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) , @xmath3 ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) , and @xmath2 ( @xmath41 , @xmath42 ) .",
    "for each of the filters , the total integration time was split in shorter exposures to avoid saturation effects of the ccd and allow for a better cosmic ray filtering . in five nights we collected 12 exposures of 600  s each in @xmath2 , 6 exposures of 900  s in @xmath3 , and 5 exposures of 1800  s in @xmath4 , for total integration times of 7200 , 5400 and 9000 s , respectively .",
    "the journal of the observations is summarized in table 1 .",
    "the target was always observed close to the minimum airmass ( @xmath43 ) and under sub - arcsecond seeing conditions ( @xmath44 , as measured directly on the image ) .",
    "atmospheric conditions were optimal , with little wind and humidity always below 10% .",
    "all the nights were photometric , with the only exception of the last one which was affected by the presence of variable thin cirrus .",
    "however , the effect of the extinction was estimated to be below 0.05 magnitudes .",
    "basic reduction steps to remove instrumental signatures and to renormalize the counts for the different gains of the four ccd ports have been applied through the fors1 reduction pipeline . for each night , master bias and flats collected in day / night time have been used for debiassing and flatfielding .",
    "finally , all the exposures corresponding to a given observation block ( see table 1 ) have been combined using a median filter algorithm to remove cosmic ray hits .",
    "the @xmath4 and @xmath2 band images taken in different nights were further registered on each other and coadded .",
    "for all the science images , the flux calibration was performed using images of photometric standards obtained during the same nights , yielding extinction and color - corrected zero - points with an accuracy of a few hundredths of magnitude for each of the filters .",
    "the atmospheric extinction correction was computed according to the most recent coefficients measured for paranal .",
    "the zero - points were stable , showing negligible fluctuations from night to night , which makes it possible to compare the photometry of different nights .",
    "the atca observations give a mean position in j2000 coordinates , with estimated uncertainties , of r.a.=@xmath45 , dec.=@xmath46 at epoch 2001.3 ( mjd 51999 ) .",
    "this position is coincident within the uncertainties with that obtained from the timing data ( damico et al.1998 ) : r.a.=@xmath47 , dec=@xmath48 , which has mean epoch 1994.9 ( mjd @xmath49 ) .",
    "these results imply an upper limit on the pulsar proper motion of @xmath50 mas yr@xmath10 , @xmath51 mas yr@xmath10 .",
    "the corresponding upper limits on the pulsar transverse velocity components are @xmath52 km s@xmath10 , @xmath53 km s@xmath10 , where @xmath54 is the pulsar distance in units of 130 pc .",
    "the total transverse velocity amounts to @xmath55 km s@xmath10 .",
    "this is within the bottom 10% of measured velocities .",
    "the pulsar is at a galactic latitude of @xmath56 , and it is quite possible that its main velocity component is along the line of sight .",
    "indeed , there is some indication of a secular increase in the dispersion measure , suggesting a significant line - of - sight velocity component .      in order to register accurately the most recent pulsar position on the optical images",
    ", we needed an astrometric solution more precise than the default one derived from the telescope pointing , which can show frame to frame variations up to few arcseconds .",
    "thus , astrometry on the fors1 images was recomputed using as a reference the positions of stars selected from the recently released guide star catalogue ii ( gsc - ii ) , which have an intrinsic absolute astrometric accuracy of @xmath57 per coordinate .",
    "about 50 gsc - ii objects have been identified in one of the two averaged @xmath2-band images . of these , only 21 ( those which are not extended , not too faint , and not too close to the ccd edges ) have been considered suitable astrometric calibrators .",
    "the pixel coordinates of the reference stars have been computed by a gaussian fitting procedure using the tools available in the skycat image display interface . the transformation from pixel to sky coordinates",
    "was then computed using the program astrom , yielding an rms error of @xmath58 in both coordinates .",
    "considering the uncertainties in both the radio position and in the optical astrometry , the final rms uncertainty in registration of the pulsar on the optical image is @xmath59 in r.a . and @xmath60 in dec .",
    "the final error budget takes into account the errors of the radio pulsar coordinates at the epoch of the optical observations ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the r.a .   and",
    "directions , respectively ) , the rms error of our astrometric fit ( @xmath63 ) , and the propagation of the intrinsic absolute errors on the gsc - ii coordinates ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "we note that since the astrometry of the gsc - ii was originally calibrated using stars from the hipparcos and tycho catalogues , which are tied to the extragalactic radio source frame ( icrf ) , our position should not be affected by any systematic offset between the radio and optical reference frames .",
    "the pulsar position at the epoch of our optical observations is marked in figures 1 through 3 , where we show @xmath64 cutouts of the co - added @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 images .",
    "we note that our determination of the pulsar position differs by about @xmath65 from that shown in figure 5 of kurt et al .",
    "the reason for this is probably due to the fact that kurt et al",
    ". assumed as a reference the original pulsar coordinates reported by tauris et al .",
    "( 1994 ) .    to facilitate the object detection , all the images have been smoothed using a gaussian filter with a @xmath66 of 3 pixels in both @xmath67 and @xmath68 directions .",
    "we see from these images that the computed pulsar position falls close to an elliptical galaxy in the field .",
    "the distance from the galaxy edge is about @xmath69 , in the east direction .",
    "since such a distance corresponds to about twice the uncertainty of the pulsar position in r.a , it is unlikely that the pulsar is hidden behind the galaxy , but we can not rule it out .",
    "while no point source is obviously visible at the pulsar location in the @xmath2 and @xmath3 images , an excess of counts can be recognized in the @xmath4 image , with a magnitude of @xmath70 .",
    "however , the low significance of this detection ( @xmath71 ) , together with the lack of corresponding detections in the other filters and the proximity of the galaxy , suggest that it may be due to a background fluctuation .",
    "only few point - like objects ( labelled in figures 13 ) have been detected within a radius of @xmath72 from the pulsar position .",
    "these objects , together with their positions relative to the pulsar and the extinction - corrected photometry in the three filters , are listed in table 2 . however , as it is evident from both table 2 and figures 13 , all these objects are too distant from the nominal pulsar position to be considered candidate counterparts .    therefore , we conclude that no optical counterpart to the pulsar can be identified in our data . using as a reference the fluxes of the faintest objects detected in the pulsar surroundings ( table 2 )",
    ", we can derive @xmath73 upper limits of @xmath74 , @xmath6 and @xmath75 on the pulsar magnitudes .",
    "thus our limits are deeper than those obtained by kurt et al .",
    "( 2000 ) by more than 3 magnitudes .",
    "the upper limits on spectral flux at effective frequences of the three bands ( fukugita , shimasaku , & ichikawa 1995 ) are plotted in figure 4 .",
    "the deepest @xmath3-band limit corresponds to the following limit on the ( brightness ) temperature      where @xmath77 , @xmath78 , the subscript @xmath79 denotes the quantities as measured by a distant observer : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 is the gravitational redshift parameter ( @xmath83 for a neutron star mass @xmath84 and radius @xmath85 km . ) in this estimate , we neglect corrections due to interstellar extinction as they are expected to be negligible at the small distance . for the dispersion distance @xmath11 pc and radius @xmath86 km",
    ", we obtain @xmath87 k. this value is considerably lower than @xmath88 k , which follows from the upper limit on the _ euve _ flux of this pulsar ( korpela & bowyer 1998 ) , for the same @xmath89 and @xmath90 , and @xmath91 @xmath92 . it is also much lower than the lowest upper limit , @xmath93 k , estimated from optical / uv observations of another nearby pulsar , b0950 + 08   k in the paper of pavlov et al .",
    "( 1996 ) was estimated for @xmath94 pc .",
    "the distance @xmath95 pc was obtained by brisken et al .",
    "( 2002 ) from improved parallax measurements . ]",
    " see pavlov , stringfellow , & crdova ( 1996 ) .",
    "the limiting temperature is even lower for @xmath96 pc , suggested by tauris et al .",
    "( 1994 ) : @xmath97 k. we plot the blackbody spectra at these values of @xmath98 and @xmath89 in figure 4 .",
    "the corresponding limits on bolometric luminosity , @xmath99 , are @xmath100 and @xmath101 erg s@xmath10 , for @xmath11 pc and 60 pc , respectively .",
    "we adopt the more conservative 130 pc estimate in the following discussion and consider @xmath102 k and @xmath103 erg s@xmath10 as plausible upper limits .",
    "the limit on thermal emission strongly constrains possible heating mechanisms . for the frictional heating mechanism ( see  1 )",
    ", one can constrain the excess angular momentum @xmath22 , residing in the superfluid , and the angular velocity lag @xmath104 , between the superfluid and the crust , averaged over the superfluid moment of inertia .",
    "for instance , using equation ( 9 ) of larson & link ( 1999 ) , we obtain @xmath105 erg s , @xmath106 rad s@xmath10 , where @xmath107 rad s@xmath108 is the time derivative of the angular frequency of the pulsar , @xmath109 g @xmath110 is the moment of inertia of the portion of the superfluid that is differentially rotating , estimated for the friedman & pandharipande ( 1981 ) equation of state .",
    "the upper limit on the lag is well below the maximum lag , @xmath111 rad s@xmath10 ( e.g. , van riper et al .",
    "1995 ) , sustainable by superfluid vortices before unpinning from the crust lattice .",
    "the rate of joule heating caused by dissipation of the magnetic field in the ns crust depends on the strength @xmath112 of the magnetic field generated in the crust during or shortly after ns formation , the density @xmath113 of at the crust bottom , the crust impurity parameter @xmath114 that determines the crust conductivity , and equation of state of the matter in the ns interior ( miralles et al .",
    "comparing our limit with the results of miralles et al . , we can conclude that , for instance , if @xmath115 g , the values of @xmath116 g @xmath19 are excluded for a plausible range of impurity parameter , @xmath117 , for both friedman & pandharipande ( 1981 ) and pandharipande & smith ( 1975 ) equations of state",
    ".    the upper limit on optical flux gives also a constraint on the temperature and size of hot polar cap(s ) predicted by radio pulsar models ( e.g. , beskin , gurevich , & istomin 1993 ) : @xmath118  k , where @xmath119 is the effective cap radius in km .",
    "however , this constraint is not truly restrictive because the limiting temperature is improbably high , @xmath120  k , for the standard estimate of polar cap radius , @xmath121  km .",
    "x - ray observations would be more efficient for observing such small , hot polar caps .",
    "the limiting @xmath3 magnitude allows one to estimate a limit on the x - ray flux assuming a non - thermal energy spectrum with slope @xmath122 as observed for several middle - aged pulsars ( e.g. , koptsevich et al.2001 ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath123 erg @xmath92 s@xmath10 in the 0.12.4 kev ( _ rosat _ ) energy band ( or @xmath124 erg @xmath92 s@xmath10 in the 0.110 kev band ) .",
    "such a flux corresponds to an upper limit on x - ray luminosity @xmath125 erg s@xmath10 ( in 0.12.4 kev ) , close to the value @xmath126 erg s@xmath10 expected from the empirical dependence @xmath127 found for a sample of radio pulsars observed with _",
    "( becker & trmper 1997 ) .",
    "even if the nonthermal radiation is a factor of a few lower than this upper limit , it can be detected with the _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ x - ray observatories .",
    "clearly , it would be desirable to have a better estimate of the pulsar distance .",
    "the pulsar s ecliptic latitude is about @xmath128 , so a parallax measurement using the nrao very long baseline array , for example , is quite feasible .",
    "it is also possible that the electron - density model could be improved , giving a more reliable dispersion - based distance estimate .",
