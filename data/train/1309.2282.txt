    "the center of our milky way galaxy hosts a supermassive black hole ( bh ) sgr a * with a mass @xmath10 located at a distance @xmath11  kpc @xcite .",
    "the bh is primarily fed by hot stellar winds in the present epoch @xcite , while clumps of cold gas provide an additional fuel source .",
    "the accretion of such clumps may have been responsible for multiple sgr a * outbursts observed as light echoes @xcite .",
    "one of such objects first identified as a gas cloud g2 is observed on its way towards sgr a * @xcite .",
    "its tail was hypothesized to be unrelated to the cloud , so that the compact cloud scenario is not excluded @xcite .",
    "g2 is on a deeply plunging orbit with the pericenter distance in the range @xmath12 @xcite , where @xmath13 is the bh schwarzschild radius .",
    "the center of mass ( cm ) of the cloud is predicted to pass the pericenter in @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "the g2 cloud may have formed from the colliding stellar winds , which are subject to runaway cooling in the densest regions@xcite .",
    "the other cloud formation scenarios are a creation of a protoplanetary disk @xcite , an encounter of a star with a stellar mass bh @xcite , and a nova outburst @xcite . in all these cases",
    "the observed radiation comes from the gas photoionized and the dust heated by the intense starlight .",
    "alternatively , the object could host a central young star , which expels stellar wind @xcite .",
    "the wind encounters ambient medium and produces a reverse shock .",
    "the observed emission then comes from the collisionally ionized shocked gas .",
    "the object was extensively studied in the infrared ( ir ) band .",
    "the intrinsic luminosities of brackett-@xmath16 ( br@xmath16 ) , paschen-@xmath17 ( pa@xmath17 ) , and helium-@xmath18 ( he@xmath18 ) lines were determined to yield @xmath19 and the dereddened ratios @xmath20 and @xmath21 in the year @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the luminosities of these three lines are consistent with constants : of br@xmath16 from @xmath6 till @xmath22 and of the other two lines from @xmath7 till @xmath0 .",
    "a constant @xmath23 is not generally expected for a photoionized cloud @xcite .",
    "the object was detected in @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands with the dereddened absolute magnitudes @xmath26 and @xmath27 in @xmath0 .",
    "an upper limit with an apparent magnitude @xmath28  mag was measured in a @xmath29 band in @xmath0 @xcite and with @xmath30  mag in @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the latter limit is uncertain due to the source confusion @xcite .",
    "the observational manifestations of g2 passing close to sgr a * were quantified . the bow shock during the pericenter passage accelerates a substantial amount of electrons .",
    "correspondent synchrotron radiation leads to an observable flux increase in the radio band @xcite .",
    "the radio flux predictions depend on the dynamics of the infall , in particular , on the cloud cross - section .",
    "if g2 is a cloud , then it is tidally disrupted at the pericenter @xcite .",
    "after the disruption some debris fall back onto sgr a * , which leads to a higher accretion rate and a higher sgr a * luminosity @xcite .",
    "the peak accretion rate and the duration of this state depend on the geometry and the cloud mass .",
    "thus , knowing the cloud properties is important for predicting the observational manifestations .",
    "the cloud radius was observed to be @xmath31  mas , which leads to the density @xmath32 and the mass @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "these estimates are based on a simple photoionization of a spherical shape .",
    "full radiative transfer calculations and fitting of the full ir dataset were not conducted . neither the consistency of the cloud hypothesis with the temporal behavior of the observed emission was quantitatively addressed .",
    "the detailed emission diagnostics may either indicate that g2 is inconsistent with a gas cloud or confirm the cloud hypothesis and help to reliably determine the object properties .    in the present paper",
    "we perform such detailed analysis of g2 assuming a gas cloud paradigm .",
    "we compute the incident continuum from a set of massive stars with known coordinates and luminosities .",
    "we employ the radiative transfer code cloudy @xcite to simulate the emission from the dust and the photoionized gas . in section  [ sec : models ] we describe three models for the cloud shape : the spherical , tidally distorted , and magnetically arrested . in section  [ sec :",
    "emission ] we present fitting of the simulated emission to the data .",
    "we explore both the @xmath1  nm graphite dust grains and the full distribution of grain sizes incorporated into the interstellar medium ( ism ) dust model .",
    "we find good fits to @xmath0 ir data and reproduce the temporal behavior of the ir emission with both the spherical and magnetically arrested cloud shapes . in section  [ sec : pericenter ] we adopt the best - fitting magnetically arrested g2 model and estimate radiation during the pericenter passage .",
    "the radio luminosity of the bow shock is revised down to below the quiescent level of sgr a * owing to the smaller cloud cross - section . in section  [ sec : discussion ]",
    "we discuss the results .",
    "the observed ir magnitudes are commonly reported in vega magnitude system @xmath34 .",
    "the conversion between the ab system and vega system is frequency - dependent and is given by the formulas @xcite @xmath35 while a single relation exists between the specific fluxes and the apparent ab magnitudes @xcite @xmath36 the extinction coefficients towards the galactic center are @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "a sphere is the simplest shape .",
    "the spherical cloud is characterized by the radius @xmath40 and the proton density @xmath41 .",
    "the shape stays constant with time , which might not represent the physical behavior of a tenuous gas clump with weak self - gravity .",
    "it was suggested that the additional gravity of the enclosed star may help to preserve the cloud shape @xcite .",
    "a tenuous object is tidally disrupted , when it passes within the tidal radius @xmath42 from the bh .",
    "if the central young t tauri star is present , then its mass is around @xmath43 @xcite . using the stellar mass @xmath44 in place of the cloud mass we obtain the tidal radius @xmath45  arcsec for the fiducial cloud radius @xmath46  mas @xcite .",
    "this tidal radius is comparable , but smaller than the cloud apocenter @xmath47  arcsec @xcite .",
    "thus , the central star only helps to delay the tidal disruption of g2 on its way to sgr a*.      in the absence of the central star the tidal radius is @xmath48  arcsec for the fiducial cloud mass @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "it is much larger than the apocenter radius , so that the cloud self - gravity can be neglected .",
    "we consider the parts of the cloud to move independently in the gravitational field of sgr a*. on its way towards the center g2 is stretched along the direction of motion and compressed in the perpendicular direction just like a spherically symmetric accretion flow .",
    "the tidally distorted cloud is characterized by the initial radius @xmath40 and the initial density @xmath41 , similarly to the spherical model .",
    "we denote by @xmath49 the distance to sgr a * , where the cloud is formed and where the spherical shape is assumed .",
    "let us derive the half - length @xmath50 of the cloud based on the properties of its elliptical orbit .",
    "in the following we consider the cloud to be sufficiently small , while all its parts are taken to move along the same trajectory . then the half - length is proportional to velocity of the cloud along its trajectory @xmath51 . the angular momentum conservation of the cloud is @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the angular velocity at the distance @xmath54 from sgr a*. the energy conservation reads @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the radial velocity . the velocity along the trajectory @xmath57 is then @xmath58 the resultant half - length is @xmath59 this formula explains dramatic elongation of simulated clouds forming at the apocenter @xcite . if the cloud starts far from the apocenter , then the expression simplifies to @xmath60 the perpendicular size @xmath61 depends on the initial velocity distribution in the cloud , but if g2 behaves like a converging flow inward of the apocenter , then @xmath61 is proportional to the distance @xmath62 the converging flow behavior is natural for the cloud formation via the cooling instability . in contrast , for their calculations @xcite assumed isotropic gaussian initial velocity distribution of cloud particles with high dispersion @xmath63 .",
    "the resultant cloud density is @xmath64    the cloud may have formed near the apocenter , where it spends most of its time along the orbit .",
    "however , according to formula  ( [ eq : length ] ) such a cloud becomes very elongated , which is inconsistent with the observed size .",
    "the latest estimates of the g2 orbit give the apocenter radius @xcite @xmath65 and the pericenter radius @xmath66 while we take the formation distance to be @xmath67 inward of the apocenter .",
    "the described tidally distorted shape is more suitable , than the spherical shape , for the cloud without the central source , but it assumes zero magnetic field .",
    "strong magnetic field alters the cloud shape .",
    "we denote by @xmath68 the ratio of the magnetic field energy density to the gas energy density in the cloud at the place of formation , such that @xmath69 where the cloud temperature is approximately @xmath70  k @xcite .",
    "the magnetic flux conservation along the direction of motion @xmath71 leads to a substantial growth of the b - field and the correspondent magnetic forces as in the spherical magnetized accretion flow @xcite .",
    "two dominant forces acting on the cloud perpendicular to its orbital plane are the gravitational force @xmath72 where the cloud mass is @xmath73 , and the magnetic force @xmath74 the hot ambient gas force @xmath75 and the cloud gas force @xmath76 can be comparable to the magnetic force at the formation distance , but are sub - dominant inward as the magnetization of the cloud grows .",
    "the parallel force balance is dominated by the rapidly growing gravitational force @xmath77 , so that the cloud is stretched in the parallel direction according to the equation  ( [ eq : length ] ) as in the tidally distorted model . solving the perpendicular force balance",
    "@xmath78 we find the perpendicular radius @xmath79 which depends weakly on both the initial cloud magnetization @xmath68 and the formation distance . the distance from sgr a * , where the cloud becomes magnetically arrested is @xmath80 there the perpendicular cloud size switches from @xmath81 to @xmath82 behavior .",
    "the critical distance @xmath83 equals the formation distance @xmath84  arcsec for the initial magnetization @xmath85 the density is approximately @xmath86 of the cloud , which forms magnetically arrested .",
    "the column density of such a cloud is practically constant with distance to sgr a * as @xmath87 .",
    "we define the free - fall time at the distance @xmath54 as @xmath88 is the keplerian velocity .",
    "the efficient magnetic energy dissipation occurs on the alfven timescale @xmath89 is the alfven speed .",
    "the ratio of these timescales is always @xmath90 in the magnetically arrested regime .",
    "if efficient energy dissipation happens on the dynamical time , then the cloud shape approaches the tidally distorted shape .",
    "however , the continuous magnetic field dissipation during the formation and the initial motion of the cloud is likely to leave the large scale ordered magnetic field or the highly helical magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the resultant inefficient dissipation likely occurs on the large timescale @xmath91 we adopt the latter case of weak dissipation and neglect the influence of the finite @xmath92 on the cloud shape .",
    "we fit the @xmath0 observational data and explore the temporal behavior of the models for all three presented shapes .",
    "the incident radiation flux and spectrum need to be reliably determined to model the cloud .",
    "we quantify the incident radiation starting from the properties of the individual bright stars in the galactic center region .",
    "we take the positions and the velocities of the bright stars from @xcite and the stellar temperatures and luminosities from @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we correct the sample of wolf - rayet stars for completeness .",
    "the incident flux emitted by the bright stars is dominated at sgr a * by irs16nw , irs16c , and irs16sw .",
    "the vertical offsets @xmath93 of irs16nw and irs16c are not known , but their @xmath93 velocities are much larger than that of irs16sw @xcite .",
    "then we assume irs16nw and irs16c to have zero vertical offsets @xmath94 .",
    "the rest of the bright stars contribute about @xmath95 of the total flux from these three .",
    "the irs16 stars are more than @xmath96  arcsec away from sgr a*. the closer in , but less luminous , s stars might substantially contribute .",
    "we explicitly include s0 - 2 star into the calculations as one of the most luminous and the closest to sgr a * s stars @xcite .",
    "dimmer s stars contribute relatively little to the incident ionizing flux , when g2 is far from the pericenter .",
    "their initial mass function ( imf ) has the slope @xmath97 @xcite .",
    "however , the dependence of their bolometric luminosity on mass is very steep @xmath98 at @xmath99 ( e.g. @xcite ) and the dependence of the luminosity above the hydrogen ionization threshold is even steeper .",

    "the specific synchrotron flux above the cooling break behaves as @xmath218 and the estimated intrinsic luminosity is @xmath219 the predicted power @xmath220 at @xmath221  kev is slightly below the quiescent unabsorbed luminosity of sgr a * @xmath222 @xcite , but is much below the luminosity @xmath223 of the magnetar , which turned on near sgr a * on @xmath14 april 23 @xcite .",
    "the bow shock should have passed through the pericenter around @xmath14 march according to @xcite ahead of the cm .",
    "the specific flux increase by @xmath224  jy at @xmath225  ghz was observed in @xmath14 april @xcite , but the observations in @xmath14 june by @xcite showed that sgr a * returned to the mean level of radio flux .",
    "as the intrinsic variability of sgr a * is about @xmath226  jy at @xmath225  ghz @xcite , then the rise observed in @xmath14 april may have been unrelated to the cloud , especially since no substantial flux increase was detected at the lower frequencies @xmath227  ghz @xcite .",
    "no substantial x - ray flux increase was reported either from the sgr a * region before the magnetar turned on in @xmath14 april @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the ambient magnetic field energy density to the radiation energy density is about @xmath228 at the pericenter .",
    "then the inverse compton power is @xmath229 times lower than the synchrotron power for the same @xmath16 , and the particles cool via the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the inverse compton emission power @xcite @xmath230 peaks at a frequency @xmath231 where @xmath232 is a frequency of the seed optical and ultraviolet photons .",
    "the inverse compton x - rays are produced by the electrons with the lorentz factors @xmath233 .",
    "convolution of the electron distribution with the photon field gives the inverse compton x - ray luminosity @xmath234 much below the quiescent level of sgr a*. the inverse compton scattering of the dust ir emission produces an even lower x - ray power , since the particle acceleration site is offset from the cm .",
    "when the tidally disrupted object is not magnetized , then the tidal shock occurs at a specific location , where the orbital planes of the independently moving cloud particles intersect @xcite .",
    "the shock can locally heat the gas up to the relatively high temperature , despite the compressed gas cools efficiently on the way to the pericenter @xcite .",
    "however , the tidal shock does not occur in the magnetically arrested model , where the cloud is supported by the magnetic pressure .",
    "instead , gradual heating takes place over the entire volume of the cloud .",
    "the best - fitting magnetically arrested model has the density @xmath235 , the magnetic field @xmath236  g , and the alfven crossing time @xmath237  mo at the pericenter .",
    "the self - consistency of the model requires that the magnetic field dissipation time is much longer than the alfven time @xmath238  yr .",
    "then the volume heating rate is @xmath239 heating is substantial only over a part of the cloud near the pericenter with the length @xmath240 , since @xmath241 depends steeply on the distance to sgr a*.    @xcite expect the interaction with the hot ambient medium to drive a strong shock into the cloud , since the gas pressure of the cloud is much less than the ambient pressure .",
    "however , the ratio of the ambient gas pressure to the cloud magnetic pressure is @xmath242 at the pericenter in the magnetically arrested model .",
    "the ratio is much less than unity and the cloud is magnetically supported against the ambient hot gas .",
    "then we do not expect the shock or the corresponding x - ray radiation .",
    "the equation  ( [ eq : pressures ] ) also justifies neglecting the ambient gas force @xmath75 in the force balance given by the equation  ( [ eq : fbalance ] ) .",
    "we simulate the emission from the part of the cloud near the pericenter heated by the magnetic field dissipation .",
    "we take the perpendicular size and cloud density based on formulas ( [ eq : rho ] ) and ( [ eq : magdense ] ) , respectively , at a distance @xmath243 . extra heating with a specified rate per unit volume",
    "is a standard option in cloudy , while the gas temperature is a standard code output . the model with the dissipation time @xmath244 produces relatively warm gas at @xmath245  k , which emits less powerful hydrogen and helium lines .",
    "the dust temperature reaches @xmath246  k , which is still below the sublimation threshold @xcite .",
    "such dust manifests as an ir source with the apparent magnitudes @xmath247 , @xmath248 , and @xmath249 , which are comparable in @xmath25 and @xmath24 band to @xmath0 data and up to @xmath250  mag brighter than the upper limit in @xmath251 band .",
    "the gas cools more efficiently for the larger dissipation times @xmath252 , so that the gas temperature settles to @xmath253  k. this drives br@xmath16 luminosity down from the case of no extra heating .",
    "if only the ionizing radiation heats the gas , then the simulated br@xmath16 luminosity is @xmath254 at the pericenter due to the larger cloud density and the higher s0 - 2 flux , which is @xmath193 times brighter than the observed level .",
    "even small heating with @xmath252 decreases the br@xmath16 emissivity in the optically thin models , which could lead to a constant or a decreasing br@xmath16 flux from the cloud as it passes through the pericenter .",
    "non - equilibrium ionization effects may as well modify pericenter br@xmath16 luminosity .",
    "in the present paper we report the line and the dust diagnostics of the g2 object , hypothesized to be a gas cloud , moving towards sgr a * in the galactic center .",
    "we consider three cloud shapes : the spherical , tidally distorted , and magnetically arrested .",
    "the cloud shape might be close to spherical in the presence of the central star .",
    "the tidally distorted shape is appropriate for the unmagnetized cloud without the central object .",
    "the magnetically arrested regime is representative of the magnetized cloud behavior .",
    "we identify the optically thin and the optically thick groups of models based on the optical depth to the incident ionizing radiation .",
    "the models perform differently , when compared to the data .",
    "the optically thin spherical models show the constant br@xmath16 luminosity , despite @xcite expects only the collisionally ionized gas with the internal energy source to reproduce @xmath255 . however , the spherical models overestimate the cloud size above the observed value .",
    "the optically thin tidally distorted shapes show a relatively large increase of @xmath23 inconsistent with the observations , while the optically thick tidally distorted shapes provide worse spectral fits .",
    "all computed magnetically arrested models show the relatively weak increase of @xmath23 with time marginally consistent with the observations .",
    "the best - fitting magnetically arrested model has the initial density @xmath2 , the initial radius @xmath3 , the cloud mass @xmath162 , and the dust abundance @xmath5 relative to the ism .",
    "such cloud forms as a spherical object at the distance @xmath84  arcsec from sgr a*. from the place of formation to the pericenter the cloud is in the perpendicular balance of the magnetic force and the gravitational force .",
    "this model reaches a good agreement with the br@xmath16 luminosity , the ratio @xmath130 , and the @xmath24 and @xmath25 magnitudes observed in @xmath0 .",
    "it is marginally consistent with the luminosities and the magnitudes reported in @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the radial stretching of the cloud leads to the projected size in agreement with the observed spatial extent in @xmath7 and @xmath0 , while the correspondent spread of the radial velocity is underpredicted .",
    "simultaneous agreement of the velocity spread and the cloud size may require resolution of the observational uncertainties or the modeling approximations .    the @xmath24 band emission is simulated to grow by @xmath256  mag from @xmath6 till @xmath0 and is expected to reach @xmath257  mag at the pericenter as the incident flux further increases by @xmath183 compared to @xmath0 ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) .",
    "this is comparable to the brightness produced due to the magnetic field dissipation .",
    "the dim s stars provide an additional contribution to the incident flux at the pericenter due to the rising inwards surface brightness profile @xmath258 @xcite .",
    "they are not expected to produce a substantial number of the ionizing photons , but their radiation is reprocessed by the dust .",
    "however , the internal dust heating may dominate the heating by the incident flux .",
    "the dissipation of the magnetic energy near the pericenter raises the temperature of the gas , which collisionally heats the dust . as a result ,",
    "the dust emits substantially more ir light and the cloud could reach total observed magnitude up to @xmath259 .",
    "the observations of the pericenter passage in the ir band probe the magnetic energy dissipation rate , though such observations are difficult due to the source confusion near sgr a * @xcite .",
    "the bow shock region may produce a distinct radiative signature .",
    "the bow shock should brighten in the radio band and the x - rays some time before the center of mass passes through the pericenter .",
    "the brightening lasts for the dynamical time @xmath260  mo at the wavelengths @xmath261 m affected by the synchrotron cooling .",
    "however , the best - fitting magnetically arrested model predicts the radio and x - ray fluxes below the current quiescent level of sgr a*. the radio flux is a factor of @xmath262 lower than the prediction in @xcite owing mainly to the smaller cross - section .",
    "yet , the predicted emission is still uncertain by a factor of several , since the particle acceleration efficiency is not known @xcite .",
    "the positive detection or the non - detection of the radio flux from g2 constrain the product of the particle acceleration efficiency by the bow shock cross - section .",
    "the x - ray observations constrain the acceleration of particles to the large lorentz factors @xmath217 .",
    "it is instructive to compare the presented dusty cloud emission modeling with the scenario , where the recombination lines are emitted within the wind from a massive central star @xcite .",
    "the latter scenario naturally produces very low radio flux from the bow shock owing to a very small bow shock cross - section @xcite .",
    "however , br@xmath16 luminosity may grow substantially with time in this scenario @xcite in contradiction with the observations .    following the pericenter passage the cloud is disrupted by the combined effects of the kelvin - helmholtz and rayleigh - taylor instabilities , the external pressure , the differential gravitational force , and the conductive evaporation of the cloud @xcite .",
    "we show that the cloud mass may be much larger @xmath9 compared to the estimate in @xcite",
    ". the resultant bh accretion rate and the accretion flow luminosity may also be higher @xcite , if the disruption dynamics is unchanged .",
    "the heavier clouds are to be tested with the future numerical simulations of g2 .    despite the agreement with the data ,",
    "the best - fitting magnetically arrested model might not fully represent the g2 cloud .",
    "we considered three idealized cases for the shape , while more options are possible .",
    "if the magnetization is relatively low @xmath263 , then the cloud starts off as the tidally distorted shape , while closer to the pericenter it switches to the magnetically arrested regime .",
    "however , if the switching happens after @xmath6 , then such hybrid models may exhibit a large rise of the br@xmath16 luminosity inconsistent with the observations .",
    "the magnetized cloud might not closely follow the computed magnetically arrested shape .",
    "if the magnetic field in the cloud dissipates on the dynamical timescale , then the object approaches the denser tidally distorted shape .",
    "such models are similarly disfavored by the observations . finally , the dynamical effects acting on the cloud may reduce its mass",
    ". then @xmath23 could rise less steeply or even be constant with time in the magnetically arrested models , so that better consistency with the observations is reached .",
