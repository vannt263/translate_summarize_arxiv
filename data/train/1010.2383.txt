    "a josephson junction is characterized by its current - phase relation @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the phase difference across the junction .",
    "@xmath0 must have two general properties : it must be @xmath2- periodic and it must be an odd function",
    ". therefore @xmath0 can be any periodic , odd function @xcite .",
    "in here we focus on sinusoidal josephson junctions . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian of system is a cosine function of the gauge invariant phase difference @xcite .",
    "a josephson junction lattice is a lattice with nodes that are superconducting islands and bonds that represent josephson junctions .",
    "this lattice of josephson junctions is a model that can be used for the description of other important systems like stacked josephson junctions @xcite , high - temperature superconductors @xcite , and a rotating bec @xcite .",
    "if we ignore screening effects , we can write the hamiltonian of the system as a sum of hamiltonians of josephson junctions @xcite . in here we focus on minimization of this hamiltonian as a function of superconducting phase in presence of external magnetic field @xcite . by this minimization",
    "we obtain the ground state energy as a function of the external magnetic field , or frustration factor , which is defined as the ratio of flux through a plaquette with unit area to the quantum of flux .",
    "behavior of ground state energy @xmath3 as a function of frustration factor @xmath4 is interesting .",
    "when @xmath4 is zero all junctions can attain their absolute minimum , but when @xmath4 becomes nonzero , the bonds of the lattice can not generally obtain this absolute minimum simultaneously and produce some superconducting current  this is the origin of the term _",
    "frustration_.    we approximate the behavior of the lattice in ground state by the independent plaquette model ( ipm ) , @xcite which considers the plaquettes independently .",
    "also we suppose that total vorticity of lattice is zero .",
    "this condition can be understood once we look at the relation of this model with charged coulomb gas ( ccg ) model .",
    "the hamiltonian of the josephson junction lattice can be mapped to ccg on dual lattice , where the charge of each point in dual lattice is proportional to vorticity of corresponding plaquette in original lattice @xcite .",
    "this shows that the zero vorticity condition in ccg model means that the system is neutral .",
    "this condition was applied before for the description of numerical results on the square lattice @xcite . in here we apply this condition for lattices with two types of plaquettes , corresponding to ccg models with four types of charge .",
    "our result is in agreement with those without this explicit condition and is an improvement on them @xcite .",
    "behavior of @xmath5 is in close relation with behavior of critical temperature @xmath6 of lattice .",
    "in fact , when the ground state energy is increased , we expect that the critical temperature is lowered and vice versa @xcite .",
    "our result is in agreement with the mean field approach for @xmath6@xcite .",
    "this model can be mapped onto the frustrated @xmath7 model@xcite , which is the @xmath7 model with unitary coupling which is dependent on a parameter equivalent to the frustration factor .",
    "this model is in close relation to the frenkel - kontorova model@xcite which describes the behavior of the ground state for a system of particles under the effect of the lattice potential .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : in section ii , we introduce our model with the zero vorticity condition ; in section iii we compare the results of the model with the numerical study , comparing energies and corresponding fourier spectra ; the final section is devoted to conclusions .",
    "for a josephson junction lattice , the hamiltonian is , @xmath8 where @xmath9 means that @xmath10th node and @xmath11th node are connected through a bond of lattice .",
    "@xmath12 is the gauge invariant phase difference .",
    "it is equal to @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the superconducting phase and @xmath15 is the integral of the vector potential from @xmath10th node to @xmath11th node .",
    "we define the frustration factor as the ratio of magnetic flux through a plaquette with unit area to the flux quantum .",
    "the gauge invariant phase difference satisfies the fluxoid quantization@xcite , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an integer and @xmath18 is the area of @xmath19th plaquette .",
    "summation is over the edges of @xmath19th plaquette .",
    "@xmath20 is vorticity of plaquette , and in transformation to ccg , is proportional to charges on @xmath19th site of the dual lattice point@xcite .",
    "@xmath17 can have two values : @xmath21 or @xmath22 where @xmath23 means greatest integer less than @xmath24 .",
    "it means that if we have @xmath25 types of plaquettes , then we have @xmath26 different values for @xmath20 and therefore @xmath26 types of charges in the equivalent ccg model .",
    "we want to minimize this hamiltonian with respect to the superconducting phases .",
    "we use the monte - carlo ( mc ) method@xcite for the numerical minimization .",
    "we denote this minimum by @xmath3 which is normalized by the number of junctions .    from symmetry of a single plaquette",
    ", we can say that all four gauge invariant phase differences are equal , and we denote it by @xmath27 . then from eq .",
    "[ zerovort ] , we can find @xmath28 , for two choices of @xmath29 , and giving the ground state energy of the plaquette as @xcite , @xmath30 for @xmath31 . now , we approximate the hamiltonian as follows : supposing that @xmath19th plaquette has vorticity @xmath32 , then it has energy @xmath33 in ipm approximation , and we can write hamiltonian [ hamil ] as sum of these energies in ipm approximation : @xmath34 where @xmath35 determines vorticity of @xmath19th plaquette .",
    "now we minimize above hamilitonian with respect to @xmath35 . in original ipm ,",
    "we choose @xmath35 , such that @xmath36 becomes nearest integer to @xmath37@xcite .",
    "because of interaction between plaquettes this is not exact , and some of the plaquettes give the furthest integer as their vorticity . we suppose that this deviation from ipm is such that total vorticity of lattice becomes as small as possible .",
    "this is the zero vorticity condition , with the total vorticity given as , @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 is the area of the whole lattice .",
    "the condition for zero total vorticity reads , @xmath41 where @xmath42 is total number of plaquettes .",
    "this condition can be understood if we look at the relation between josephson junction lattice and ccg .",
    "it can be shown that josephson junction hamiltonian can be mapped to ccg on the dual lattice , and in this transformation @xmath20 is proportional to charge on the equivalent point in the dual lattice .",
    "hence , the zero vorticity condition is equivalent to the charge neutrality of ccg system .",
    "@xcite    suppose that we have @xmath19 types of plaquettes in a lattice , then each type can take on two energies , either @xmath43 or @xmath44 , bringing in @xmath45 variables .",
    "but the total number of each type of plaquette is determined and therefore we have @xmath19 constraints on these variables and there are @xmath19 independent variables . using the above equation lets us remove one of these variables and finally we have @xmath46 variables .",
    "if we apply the ipm approximation , the hamiltonian becomes linear in terms of these variables and easily can be minimized .",
    "we denote this model as ipm0 .",
    "we use the power spectrum of @xmath5 to characterize it , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the complex conjugate of @xmath49 , the fourier transform of @xmath5 , @xmath50 the power spectrum was calculated in matlab by the @xmath51 method@xcite .",
    "now we focus on lattices with two types of plaquettes .",
    "we choose two lattices : the fibonacci ladder and the penrose lattice .",
    "these two cases are in close relation with each other",
    ". ratio of areas of plaquettes in both are the same and both make use of the fibonacci order .",
    "therefore we can compare their energies to give some insight about the difference between them . from the above discussion",
    ", we can find that these josephson junction lattices are equivalent to the @xmath52 model with four types of charge .",
    "in here we consider the above formulation for lattices with two types of plaquettes which we denote them by @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "@xmath54 plaquette has area @xmath55 and @xmath53 plaquette has area @xmath56 .",
    "density of @xmath54 plaquettes is @xmath57 and that of the @xmath53 plaquettes is @xmath58 , therefore @xmath59 .",
    "we suppose that the density of @xmath54 ( @xmath53 ) plaquettes with energy @xmath43 is @xmath60(@xmath61 ) , therefore from eq .",
    "[ zerocir ] , we can find that @xmath62    this condition for a lattice with one type of plaquette ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 ) is reduced to @xmath65 which is in agreement with the previous result @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for a lattice with two types of plaquettes within the ipm is @xmath66 now we minimize hamiltonian with respect to these two densities with condition eq .",
    "if we increase @xmath61 by one ( therefore decrease @xmath61 by one ) , then change in hamiltonian is @xmath67 , therefore if @xmath68 then @xmath69 and if @xmath70 then @xmath71 where @xmath72 means the minimum between @xmath24 and @xmath73 .",
    "we can write these results as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the step function which is zero for negative @xmath24 and one for positive @xmath24 , and @xmath76 represents the right hand side of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] .",
    "now we apply these results to a ladder with two types of plaquettes and the 2d penrose lattice .      for this lattice",
    "we have , @xmath77 and the plaquettes appear in the fibonacci order , defined as follows . denoting the structure in its @xmath78th step of construction by @xmath79 , the structure is constructed recursively by the rule @xmath80 , where summation means adjacent placement : to get the structure in step @xmath81 , put the structure in step @xmath82 , first and that of step @xmath78 , to its right .",
    "this generates the sequence @xmath83 in the limit of an infinite structure this defines a quasicrystalline lattice such that ratio of @xmath58 to @xmath57 is @xmath84 .",
    "the energy and fourier spectra for mc and ipm0 are given in figs .",
    "[ etau ] and [ ftau ] .",
    "[ etau ]        [ ftau ]    as we see , the agreement between two results is very good . from fourier spectrum comparison , we see that there are peaks on @xmath85 , for both models .",
    "this agrees with the results of ipm without the zero vorticity condition@xcite .",
    "we also compare results of these two methods for other types of lattices with different ratio of areas and again find good agreement .",
    "penrose lattice is an example of 2d quasicrystals @xcite which has two types of rhombi with areas @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "it is known that minimization of josephson junction hamiltonian on this lattice , as well as on the fibonacci ladder , does not result in a periodic @xmath5 ; similarly , @xmath6 is aperiodic @xcite .",
    "our numerical results agree with this observation .",
    "we compare the ground state energy for this lattice with its one - dimensional counterpart , the fibonacci ladder .",
    "this shown in fig .",
    "[ efp ] .     and fibonacci ladder @xmath88 . , width=377 ]    [ efp ]",
    "we see that the ground state energy for the penrose lattice is greater than that of the fibonacci ladder .",
    "this can be related to the constraints involved : in the two dimensional case there are more neighboring plaquettes than in the ladder geometry .",
    "the ground state energy using mc and ipm0 and their corresponding fourier spectra for the penrose lattice are shown in figs .",
    "[ epenrose ] and [ fpenrose ] .",
    "[ epenrose ]        [ fpenrose ]    we can see that the results of ipm0 are in agreement generally with monte - carlo results .",
    "also ipm0 predicts the main frequencies of @xmath5 correctly .",
    "we enter a condition in the calculation of the ground state energy of josephson junction lattices , namely that the total vorticity of lattice be zero .",
    "this condition along with the independent plaquette model ( ipm ) gives us the properties of the ground state energy with good approximation .",
    "it can describe the main peaks of the fourier spectrum of @xmath5 on areas of plaquettes and their sum and difference . in 2d",
    "the accuracy of the model is not as good as in the case of the ladder , because of greater effects of neighboring plaquettes : in 2d a plaquette has more neighbors than in the ladder , and therefore ipm is worse in 2d than in the effectively 1d ladder .",
    "zero vorticity condition can be understood when we look at the connection of josephson junction hamiltonian with ccg . in ccg model vorticity of plaquette",
    "plays the role of charge on its corresponding dual lattice site .",
    "therefore zero vorticity condition in ccg means that system of charge is neutral , which naturally leads to a lower energy for the ground state .",
