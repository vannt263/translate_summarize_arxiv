    "the standard model of particle physics ( sm ) describes at present most of the observed phenomena in nature , with the exception of a consistent inclusion of gravitational effects .",
    "still , there are several open questions remaining in this model , concerning , among others , the matter of electroweak symmetry breaking , as well as the explicit particle content of the model , where there are three generations for both quarks and leptons .",
    "this latter question can be answered in the context of the 331 models @xcite , where anomaly cancellation and the asymptotic freedom of qcd require the number of generations to be precisely three . in order to do so",
    ", the @xmath0 doublet of the weak interactions is extended to a triplet with additional heavy quarks , and , additionally , the third generation transforms as an anti - triplet under the @xmath1 .    in the breaking process of this new , enlarged gauge group to the sm and , subsequently , its electromagnetic @xmath17 , additional gauge bosons are encountered , among these a neutral @xmath2 boson , which is naturally heavier than the sm gauge bosons , since its mass arises from the larger vev that breaks the @xmath1 at a high scale . similarly , there are heavy charged and doubly charged gauge bosons , as well as additional heavy , exotically charged ( in the minimal 331 model ) quarks that constitute the third member of the @xmath1 triplet . in the leptonic sector",
    "these third triplet members are just given by the charge conjugated counterpart of the charged sm lepton .",
    "while the charged gauge bosons can appear for low energy processes involving quarks only at loop level , since they always couple also the heavy quark , the neutral @xmath2 can transmit flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) at tree level .",
    "therefore , these processes can place rather stringent bounds on the mass of this heavy gauge boson , and there have been several analyses of certain fcnc observables in the literature @xcite .",
    "in addition , the fcnc processes involving down type quarks are also affected by the unitary quark mixing matrix used do diagonalize the down type yukawa coupling , while those involving up type quarks appear with the corresponding up type mixing matrix .",
    "thus , there is the possibility of new cp violating phases , which have , however , been neglected in all previous analyses of this type ( see , on the other hand , @xcite , where the most general type of @xmath2 coupling is analyzed in a model independent manner ) .",
    "also , it has been repeatedly pointed out in the literature @xcite , that the most stringent fcnc constraints arise from parameters involving flavor mixing , in particular the mass differences in the neutral @xmath18 and @xmath19 meson systems , and the new measurement of @xmath20 , the mass difference in the @xmath21 system is expected to have a significant impact here . in view of these two points",
    "we find it interesting to reanalyze in a complete manner the most important fcnc observables within the minimal 331 model , where we include also an analysis of several rare decay processes , which have not been analyzed before .",
    "we would also like to point out , that fcncs , which can provide lower bounds on the @xmath2 mass , are complementary to the corresponding _ upper _ bounds stemming from the fact that the model produces a landau pole above a certain scale .",
    "however , these lower bounds are always obscured by some lack of knowledge of the mixing matrix elements .",
    "therefore , we will pursue in our analysis a route that is somewhat complementary to a standard fcnc analysis : we will not attempt to place lower bounds on the @xmath2 mass , but rather set its mass at several fixed values and will try to gain some information on the structure of the appearing quark mixing matrix .",
    "in addition , we will investigate the implications of the bounds obtained from well - measured observables such as @xmath3 , @xmath22 , @xmath5 and @xmath23 for several clean rare decays , where we can give upper bounds on the corresponding branching fractions depending on the @xmath2 mass .",
    "let us finally point out that the study of fcnc processes in these models are particularly interesting as they occur at tree level , while the usual electroweak precision ( ewp ) observables , that strongly constrain most beyond sm models , occur only at the loop level , which actually makes the bounds from fcnc processes more stringent than those from ewp measurements .",
    "the most recent study of electroweak precision observables can be found in @xcite .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : model ] , we introduce the minimal 331 model , thereby also setting our conventions .",
    "in addition , we give the fcnc vertices and a convenient parameterization of the corresponding quark mixing matrix in order to reduce the number of parameters appearing .",
    "next , in section [ sec : obs ] we give the additional @xmath2 contributions to several observables , which we evaluate numerically in sect .",
    "[ sec : numerics ] . among these observables , there are the mass differences in the neutral meson systems , as noted above , as well as several cp violating quantities , from which some information on the phase structure of the model can be obtained . during this numerical analysis , we compare our work several times to a recent , similar analysis of the little higgs model with t - parity ( lht ) performed in @xcite , since both models share the feature of introducing new cp violating phases while keeping the operator basis the same as in the sm .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "let us begin by introducing the particle content of the minimal 331 model .",
    "many details of this model have been first worked out in @xcite , to which we refer the reader for some more information .",
    "the model consists of a gauge group @xmath24 , which is broken down in two steps : @xmath25 here , in contrast to the sm , two higgs multiplets are required for the breaking of @xmath26 in order to give masses to all quarks .",
    "the additional vev @xmath27 is much larger than the two others .",
    "the charge assignment for the higgs multiplets is as follows : @xmath28 @xmath29 where the @xmath30 and @xmath31 denote the real ( scalar ) and imaginary ( pseudoscalar ) fluctuations around the appropriate vevs . in analogy , the fermion content of the minimal model is given by @xmath32 where the numbers in brackets correspond to the @xmath33 , @xmath1 and @xmath34 quantum numbers .",
    "for the right - handed fields , we give only the @xmath35 number . from these , the electric charge can be obtained by @xmath36 in our normalization of the charge @xmath37 . in order to cancel anomalies ,",
    "one generation of quarks has to transform as a @xmath38 under the @xmath1 , and we choose this to be the third generation , but the explicit distinction only makes a difference once a specific structure of the mixing matrix is assumed .",
    "the factor @xmath39 can , in principle , be replaced by any number , thereby distinguishing the different 331 models . setting @xmath40 , for example , requires a different fermion structure , and with it the introduction of right - handed neutrinos @xcite .",
    "this 331 model with right - handed neutrinos has also been under quite some discussion @xcite , while analyses of models with general or at least various different values of @xmath41 have been performed in @xcite .",
    "also , there have been slight modifications added to the leptonic sector in some models in order to generate neutrino masses @xcite , as well as supersymmetric versions of the model @xcite .",
    "let us next briefly summarize the gauge boson content of the model .",
    "the physical sector consists of three neutral gauge bosons , @xmath42 and @xmath2 , which arise as mass eigenstates from the diagonalization of the gauge boson mass matrix and are composed of the gauge eigenstates as @xmath43 in these formulae , the ratio between the @xmath34 coupling @xmath44 and the @xmath1 coupling @xmath45 has already been expressed through the weinberg - angle @xmath46 : @xmath47 in addition , there are the sm - like @xmath48 bosons , as well as another singly charged @xmath49 boson , which transmits transitions from the second to third element of the triplets and a doubly charged bilepton @xmath50 , which transmits transitions from the first to the third element .",
    "we will mainly be concerned with the neutral sector in the following , and the corresponding masses are @xmath51 which leaves indeed one massless photon , a @xmath52 of the order of the weak scale as well as a heavier @xmath2 . in principle , there can also be mixing between the @xmath52 and the @xmath2 , but it is constrained to be small , see , e.g. @xcite . finally , the scalar sector of this model has been analyzed in @xcite , with the result that there is one light neutral higgs , corresponding to the sm higgs , three additional neutral heavy higgs fields as well as two singly charged and one doubly charged higgs . in principle , these higgs fields should also transmit fcncs , but these are suppressed by small yukawa couplings of the external quarks and leptons in all processes we are studying .",
    "therefore , we will focus on the effects of the additional @xmath2 , since these are expected to dominate and refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed analysis of the yukawa coupling terms .",
    "note also , that the relation ( [ ww ] ) between the coupling constants imposes additional constraints on the symmetry breaking scale @xmath27 ( and , in analogy , on the @xmath2 mass ) , in order to avoid the landau pole that arises if @xmath53 .",
    "a careful analysis @xcite shows that this scale can be several tev . to be explicit ,",
    "we take @xmath54 as an upper bound , which is close to the number given , for the case when exotically charged quarks are included , as we are doing here .",
    "the fact that the third quark family transforms differently under the @xmath1 leads to a flavor dependent @xmath2 coupling , as shown in table [ tablefermions ] , where we have collected the neutral quark - gauge boson vertices in the weak eigenstate basis , writing @xmath55 and @xmath56 in addition , we give also the coupling of the @xmath2 to leptons , which will also be required later on .",
    "this table is inspired by the similar table given in @xcite , which is , however formulated in terms of vector and axial vector couplings .",
    "the complete lagrangian for the neutral currents , given in terms of these couplings , then reads : @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "note that the lepton coupling is suppressed by a factor of @xmath59 , which enhances the quark vertices , where it appears in the denominator .",
    "therefore , the @xmath2 in the minimal 331 model has a somewhat leptophobic nature , which will become apparent in our numerical analysis .",
    "the difference between the first two and the third generation induces fcncs transmitted by the @xmath2 boson at tree level .",
    "the structure of these couplings arises , when the couplings of all quarks are collected into one universal neutral current , where unitary mixing transformations drop out , as in the case of the sm neutral current .",
    "if this is done , one additional term remains , containing only third generation quarks and describing the difference of the couplings between the third and the first two generations .",
    "transforming these left - over terms to the mass eigenstate basis yields a flavor changing interaction of the form",
    "@xmath60 { z'}^{\\mu}\\,.\\ ] ] the matrices @xmath61 and @xmath62 diagonalize the up and down - type yukawa couplings respectively and then obviously obey @xmath63 we have added the tilde to distinguish between the sm ckm matrix and the mixing matrix for the down type quarks and will omit the subscript @xmath64 in what follows .",
    "next , the charged current vertices in this basis are then @xmath65 @xmath66 the corresponding charged currents in the leptonic sector are given as feynman rules in the app .  [",
    "sec : fr ] , where we also give the explicit expression of the feynman rules for the fcnc vertices .",
    "we follow @xcite , in that we show these couplings in a basis in which the heavy @xmath67 and @xmath68 quarks are mass as well as gauge eigenstates .",
    "this fact explains the absence of an explicit mixing matrix for these heavy quarks .",
    "we have also combined them into a doublet , denoted simply as @xmath67 in the above formulae , and put the heavy @xmath69 into a separate singlet to simplify the notation .    in contrast , the left handed part of the neutral current coupling to the @xmath52 boson is given by @xmath70 as in the sm and does not discriminate between generations , so that these vertices remain flavor conserving . to find a sensible parameterization for the matrix @xmath71 , we should first count the number of additional parameters that appear in this matrix . looking at all the possible interaction terms",
    ", one finds that , after the phase transformations of the up and down - type quarks have been used to simplify the ckm matrix , there are three more possible phases that arise from transformations in the @xmath72 quarks as seen in ( [ ccvert ] ) , which leaves one with 6 additional parameters , namely three mixing angles and three phases .",
    "however , from ( [ fcnc ] ) it is obvious that only the @xmath73 elements are required when calculating fcncs , and it is possible to find a parameterization that further reduces the number of parameters appearing there .",
    "it reads @xmath74 where only two additional cp violating quantities @xmath75 and @xmath76 appear , that are responsible for the additional cp violating effects to be discussed below .",
    "note , that these cp violating phases have been neglected in all previous analyses of fcncs in 331 models .",
    "note also , that the mixing angle @xmath77 does not appear in the relevant matrix elements . in choosing the parameterization of the matrix in such a way , one has to be careful to choose one that can actually be achieved by rotating the heavy @xmath78 and @xmath69 quarks , and a general unitary matrix with the correct number of parameters may not necessarily be allowed .",
    "however , we have checked that the parameterization ( [ eq : param ] ) is .",
    "a similar parameterization , sharing several features but ignoring weak phases , can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us finally also comment on the corresponding vertices in the up - type sector of the model .",
    "in this case , there are no further phase transformations that can be performed , so that the matrix @xmath61 can be just any arbitrary unitary matrix with , correspondingly , nine parameters , i.e. three angles and six phases , subject to the constraints from ( [ ckm ] ) .",
    "additionally , the observables associated with @xmath67 mixing and decay are afflicted with rather large uncertainties coming from long distance qcd effects .",
    "therefore , we will not investigate these quantities any further in the course of this work .",
    ".[tablefermions ] list of couplings for the neutral currents in the minimal @xmath79 model . in the corresponding feynman rules ,",
    "an additional factor @xmath80 will appear .",
    "we abbreviate @xmath55 and @xmath56 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this section , we will collect the theoretical expressions for all observables relevant to our analysis .",
    "in particular , we give the @xmath2 contributions that modify the sm amplitudes .",
    "these will be investigated numerically in sect [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "we will first be concerned with observables related to @xmath81 and @xmath82 mixing .",
    "these are the mass differences @xmath3 , @xmath83 and @xmath20 , as well as the cp violating quantities @xmath4 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 . in all cases , we will concentrate on the contribution from the heavy @xmath2 bosons , while the heavier charged gauge bosons appear only at the one loop level .",
    "they can be probed , for example , in the inclusive decay @xmath86 , where the tree level terms remain absent @xcite , or similarly through decays such as @xmath87 @xcite . on the other hand , there are contributions to muon decay from these heavy charged gauge bosons . since the coupling of these heavy bosons is exactly the same as the @xmath88 coupling to the leptons , this new piece can just be absorbed into a redefinition of the coupling constant as follows : @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the coupling constant measured in muon decay , while @xmath91 is the `` true '' coupling @xmath91 , obeying @xmath92 , with @xmath45 the @xmath1 gauge coupling . to reduce the number of parameters appearing",
    ", we will assume that both the @xmath93 and @xmath2 are given entirely by those contributions stemming from the heaviest vev , and express the @xmath93 mass through @xmath94 .",
    "this procedure leads , for example , to @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "note , that these effects appear only in the lepton sector , since here the third particle of the triplet is again a sm particle . in the quark sector , however , there are no new tree - level contributions from the new charged gauge bosons , since these always couple to a heavy quark .",
    "let us finally quote @xcite , where a lower bound of @xmath97 is found from muon decay .",
    "since , in our approximation of the @xmath93 mass , this charged gauge boson is about 3 times lighter than the @xmath2 , we shall also use @xmath98 as a lower bound for @xmath99 in our analysis .",
    "a similar bound on @xmath100 has been obtained from ewp tests in @xcite .    from the fcnc lagrangian and the neutral current couplings given above",
    ", we find the tree - level effective hamiltonian for @xmath101 transitions , where @xmath102 : @xmath103 while , in the @xmath104 case , the vertex factors are replaced by @xmath105 with @xmath106 for down and strange quarks , respectively .",
    "since the @xmath2 induces fcncs left - handedly , no new operators are generated , while , in general , there are obviously new sources of flavor and cp violation in the matrix @xmath71 , so that the model does go beyond the usual minimal flavor violating ( mfv ) scenarios ( see @xcite for a review and a discussion of the several definitions of mfv that are being used ) .",
    "next , we need to take into account the different nature of @xmath19 and @xmath18 mixings : while @xmath81 mixing proceeds through the absolute value of the corresponding matrix elements , @xmath82 mixing is described by the real part only ( this distinction has been missed in the literature , note that this is not even correct in the case of vanishing cp violation in @xmath107 because of the phase in @xmath108 )",

    ".    the contribution to the kaon cp violating parameter @xmath4 can also easily be calculated from the effective hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) .",

    "note that the new contributions to both @xmath4 as well as @xmath3 are simply added to the sm contributions , i.e. there are no interference terms , while this is true in the case of @xmath5 only if the new contribution comes with the same phase as the sm contributions , as can be seen from ( [ deltamq ] ) .",
    "let us also here give the sm expression , reading @xmath117",
    "\\hat b_{k}f_{k}^2 \\,.\\ ] ]    next , before we turn to the analysis of cp violating @xmath19 decay asymmetries , let us give the contributions that modify the @xmath118 mixing phase , which is equal to @xmath119 in the sm , where @xmath41 is one of the angles of the unitarity triangle .",
    "including the additional contributions from the @xmath2 , we find @xmath120 in addition , there are also new contributions to decay amplitudes , in particular also to the amplitude of the decay @xmath121 . in the sm",
    ", this decay proceeds through a tree diagram topology with no additional cp violating phase , so that the mixing induced cp asymmetry is given by @xmath122 . in a general model , @xmath41",
    "is replaced by a value @xmath123 , which is given as @xmath124 .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath2 couples also right - handedly to the charm quark pair , and we can therefore not simply add the coefficient of the new tree diagram to the sm contribution .",
    "we have then estimated the projection onto the left - handed sm operator , which is entirely negligible , and we therefore consider it a good approximation to omit these terms .",
    "analogous modifications occur in the asymmetry of @xmath125 , which in the sm is given by @xmath126 with @xmath127 . including the new contribution , @xmath128    we note , finally , that the observables discussed in this subsection are , in principle , sufficient to determine all the parameters appearing in our parameterization of the mixing matrix ( [ eq : param ] ) .",
    "also , the experimental situation for these observables will be summarized when we perform our numerical analysis in section [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "the observable quantities listed so far are all related to meson mixing , and have also all been measured ( with the exception of @xmath12 ) .",
    "therefore , we will use them in the next section to constrain the parameter space of the model .",
    "then , we will be interested in the implications of the bounds obtained in that analysis on several rare decay amplitudes .",
    "most of the corresponding branching fractions have not yet been measured , but the measurements will tell us quite a lot about the new physics contributions , since the theoretical expressions for these decays are extremely clean .",
    "the rare decays which we will study are @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath10 , where @xmath132 can be a muon or an electron .",
    "let us then begin this subsection with some general remarks : the rare decays in question are governed by electroweak- and photon - penguins as well as leptonic box diagram contributions .",
    "these are described in the standard model by the corresponding inami lim functions @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 . in the expressions for decay amplitudes ,",
    "these always appear in the gauge invariant combinations @xmath136 , @xmath137 and @xmath138 @xcite , defined as : @xmath139 @xmath140 @xmath141 in models of minimal flavor violating type , the new contributions to decay amplitudes can often be absorbed into a universal redefinition of these functions . on the other hand , these functions will be process - dependent in models that go beyond minimal flavor violation , as explicitely discussed for the littlest higgs model with t - parity in @xcite .",
    "we will see later that the situation is even slightly more complicated in the minimal 331 model . in the following",
    ", we will , whenever possible , give the appropriate redefinition of @xmath142 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 ( the functions without the subscript 0 always refer to the nlo functions , while those where it is included are only the lo ones ) as @xmath145    we begin with the cleanest rare decays , i.e. @xmath146 , and @xmath131 .",
    "for the decay @xmath146 there exists a charged and a neutral counterpart , @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "both decays are theoretically extremely clean , since the leading qcd matrix element can be extracted from the well measured tree - level decay @xmath147 and additional long - distance qcd effects are rather well under control @xcite .",
    "the effective hamiltonian consists of contributions from both charm and top - loops , and is then given by : @xmath148 defining @xmath149 and collecting the charm contributions in @xmath150@xcite , the branching fraction for @xmath8 and @xmath7 can then be derived as @xmath151,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath152 ^ 8.\\ ] ] and @xmath153 @xmath154 ^ 8\\ ] ] the numbers for @xmath155 and @xmath156 , describing the isospin breaking effects to the @xmath157 decay , have recently been updated in @xcite . due to the absence of the charm contribution , @xmath8 is theoretically even cleaner than @xmath7 .",
    "turning now to the contributions from new physics , we find that in both cases the leading term stems from a tree diagram transmitted by the @xmath2 boson .",
    "for the effective hamiltonian , this leads to a new term of the form @xmath158 this can be absorbed into the modification of the function @xmath142 as @xmath159 we have already written ( [ bkpnn ] ) and ( [ bklpn ] ) in such a way that using the thus modified function @xmath142 gives the correct branching ratio in the 331 model .",

    "therefore , we will work only with the first solution and construct our unitarity triangle from it .",
    "the further input values are collected in table [ tab : input ] @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath187 and @xmath188 are obtained from an average of both inclusive and exclusive determinations .",
    "note , that obtaining the `` sm - predictions '' in the following by setting the @xmath142 and @xmath143 functions to their sm values leads to different predictions for the decay rates than the sm predictions quoted above .",
    "this is due to the different ckm factors used , since we are working with only the tree - level input parameters , while the earlier sm predictions used all input available in the ut fit .",
    "we perform the subsequent numerical analysis in two steps :    * in the first step , we consider the observables @xmath3 , @xmath5 , @xmath22 and @xmath122 .",
    "all these quantities are related in some way to @xmath82 and @xmath195 mixing , and have been measured to a significant precision .",

    "if one considers the theoretical expressions , there are always several parameters appearing in the corresponding bounds , i.e. the mass of the @xmath2 boson , as well as the corresponding combination of mixing - matrix elements .",
    "therefore , one can now pursue two possible analyses : the first possibility , which has been followed repeatedly in the literature @xcite , is to assume a certain texture of the mixing matrix ( in most cases this has been assumed to have a fritzsch - type structure , while another texture has been used in @xcite ) , which then allows to obtain bounds on the @xmath2 mass .",
    "several times , this has led to bounds that are potentially conflicting with the upper bounds obtained from the landau pole . on the other hand @xcite , one can set @xmath99 onto this upper bound and thereby obtain some information on the size of the corresponding mixing matrix elements . in order to be able to deal with the most general situation",
    ", we prefer not to make use of any specific parameterization of the mixing matrix , but rather follow the second possible approach , in a somewhat more general manner when considering the implications for rare decays . for the moment , we fix the @xmath2 mass to @xmath199 and @xmath200 as two representative values which give us bounds on the real and imaginary parts of @xmath201 if we consider the bounds from @xmath3 and @xmath22 , respectively . on the technical level , we proceed in a manner that is inspired by the analysis @xcite of the littlest higgs model with t - parity , where the uncertainties in the theoretical input are absorbed into a generously assigned experimental error .",
    "we use , as possible deviations from the central value , @xmath202 for @xmath5 as well as for @xmath22 , @xmath203 for @xmath3 and @xmath204 for @xmath41 .",
    "these @xmath204 correspond to an uncertainty of about @xmath205 in @xmath23 , as in @xcite ( the number from @xcite is @xmath206 ) , we choose to retain the assigned percentage of the uncertainty due to the fact that the theoretical error vastly dominates ( 0.4 are only @xmath207 of 17.4 ) . ] .",
    "a slight modification of @xmath23 would certainly be welcome in view of small discrepancy between the value of @xmath23 from @xmath208 and the one obtained from a ut fit without this input .",
    "this discrepancy can be attributed to a small experimental number @xmath209 or a large value of @xmath210 .",
    "we also keep the ckm parameters fixed at their central values since we are mainly interested in the effects that are induced by new physics , not those that arise from parameter variation .",
    "we find ( taking @xmath200 for definiteness - a similar pattern shows for other values ) @xmath211<9.2 \\cdot 10^{-6}$ ] and @xmath212<4.8 \\cdot 10^{-8}$ ] , from which we can conclude that the imaginary part of this amplitude is much stronger constrained than the real part .",
    "therefore , if we would like to saturate the bounds , we should consider an entirely real or entirely imaginary value of @xmath213 .",
    "there is then , from @xmath3 , a bound on @xmath214 which depends on @xmath215 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ v32mk ] .",
    "notice , that both elements @xmath215 and @xmath214 can not be simultaneously large .",
    "this is true for both of the chosen values of @xmath99 that we are showing .",
    "an upper bound on @xmath214 coming from @xmath3 for @xmath216(dotted ) and @xmath217(solid ) . ]",
    "the corresponding bounds from @xmath195 mixing are somewhat more subtle to deal with , since the new contributions are not simply added here , so that also interference terms are important .",
    "an estimate of the bounds can be obtained by assuming    * that the new contributions and the sm one are directly aligned , where then the deviation from the sm corresponds directly to the new contributions , or * that the new contribution is constructed in such a way that it is perpendicular to the sm contributions in the complex plain , i.e. comes with a phase @xmath218    in the first case , the absolute value of the new contribution is minimal , while in the second it is maximal . on the other hand , taking an aligned contribution allows one to circumvent the bounds coming from @xmath209 , which is much more stringent than the one from @xmath83 . to show the complementarity of the two bounds , we plot , in fig.[v33dmbd ] , the bound coming from @xmath83 in the case of aligned contributions and the bound coming from @xmath122 in the case of orthogonal contributions .",
    "we find that the bound from @xmath122 is stronger than the one from @xmath83 so that a contribution that is aligned with the sm one can be larger .",
    "the upper bound on @xmath219 coming from @xmath83 assuming that the sm and np contributions are aligned ( red ) , and the complementary bound from @xmath23 if they are perpendicular ( black ) .",
    "both are given for @xmath216 ( dotted ) and @xmath217(solid ) . ]    on the other hand , the mixing phase @xmath12 has not been measured , and can not be used to constrain the combination @xmath220 .",
    "this has two implications :    * first , we can have , in this case , a `` mirror solution '' of @xmath20 in which the new contribution is antiparallel to the sm , but twice as large . at present , this situation can not be excluded with the observables we are studying .",
    "it is , however , possible , that the large absolute value of the this new new contribution would violate bounds from @xmath221 .",
    "the new contributions to @xmath221 are , however , loop suppressed , not only through the arising couplings , but additionally by heavy propagators , so that we expect the influence to be only marginal .",
    "* there is no strong bound on an `` orthogonal contribution '' , which means that the phase @xmath12 , as measured through @xmath222 , may be rather large .",
    "in fact , we find that the present range of @xmath12 is entirely unconstrained , since there is an allowed range connecting the mirror solution with the sm - like ones .",
    "clearly , a measurement of this phase would severely constrain the available parameter space .",
    "finally , we point out that both @xmath20 and @xmath83 can be equally well enhanced or suppressed , since the sign of the new contributions can be simply switched by a change of sign in the mixing matrix @xmath62 , so that no preferred behavior of the prediction can be obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "if the data in either process should indicate an enhancement or suppression , it could always be satisfied within the minimal 331 model .",
    "let us now study the implications of the bounds derived above for the modification in rare decay amplitudes .",
    "the strategy of the analysis will be to saturate the bounds by fixing the corresponding combination @xmath223 , thereby leaving @xmath99 as the only variable left in the expressions for the rare decays . in this way",
    ", we find upper bounds for the rare decays as a function of the mass of the @xmath2 boson . for an earlier study of @xmath7 in the 331 model , see @xcite .",
    "our analysis goes beyond that one in that we consider not only the tree - level process but also the one - loop sm amplitude and the interference between the two .",
    "this is definitely appropriate , since the sm is expected to be the main contribution in most fcnc processes .",
    "beginning with the rare @xmath18 decays , we can use the information obtained from the previous section , that the real part of @xmath224 is much less constrained than the imaginary part , so that we set : @xmath225=(\\mathrm{re}[v_{ij } v_{kl}])^2\\,,\\ ] ] which effectively amounts to setting the imaginary part to zero .",
    "alternatively , one could set @xmath226=0 $ ] , where then the new contribution is purely imaginary .",
    "we will discuss this setup when we look at @xmath8 in more detail .",
    "for @xmath7 , however , we will indeed be concerned only with the purely cp conserving case .",
    "proceeding in this manner , we find an upper bound on @xmath227 as shown in fig .",
    "[ kplmzpr ] . in addition , we give also the central value of the experimental result .",
    "this experimental measurement is above the sm prediction , but well compatible within theoretical and experimental uncertainties .",
    "we find , that only rather low values of the @xmath2 mass can reach this central number .",
    "upper bound on the decay @xmath227 taking into account the constraints from @xmath3 .",
    "the sm value is denoted with a dashed line , while the present experimental central value is given by the red line.,height=226 ]    concerning the decay @xmath130 , we find it most instructive to show the upper bound that is obtained in the case of a purely cp violating @xmath2 contribution . in this case , the bound for @xmath228 is also given by the bound in @xmath3 , and is shown in fig .",
    "[ klmzpr ] .",
    "again , we find that large enhancements are , in principle , possible , in particular for values of the @xmath2 mass that lie beneath about @xmath229 .",
    "therefore , it is clear that visible signals in both @xmath230 decays can still be expected . in particular , values such as the current experimental central value of @xmath7 are entirely possible .",
    "we have , in both cases , not shown the possibility of a suppression of both branching fractions .",
    "upper bound on the decay @xmath231 taking into account the constraints from @xmath3 in the case of a purely cp violating @xmath2 contribution . in case of cp conserving @xmath2 couplings , this bound becomes more stringent.,height=226 ]    in addition , as discussed in a slightly different context in @xcite , a measurement of both decays is sufficient to find both the absolute value and phase of the unknown quantity @xmath232 , along the lines of fig [ klkp ] . here",
    ", the dashed circles correspond to variations of the phase for various values of @xmath233 , while the colored rays correspond to fixed values of the phase @xmath234 .",
    "we show here only a restricted area of the possible branching fractions , but it is clear that a measurement of both decays uniquely fixes all parameters in question .    in this context , it is interesting to see , which values of the branching fractions are actually allowed through the bounds coming from @xmath3 and @xmath22 . therefore , we now show again the @xmath8-@xmath7 plane in fig .",
    "[ klkpscat ] with those areas cut out , which are ruled out by the respective bounds . here",
    ", the red star corresponds to @xmath235 , while the blue star shows those values that are allowed for @xmath236 .",
    "notice that there are , similar to the pattern seen in the littlest higgs model with t - parity @xcite , several branches in this plane that are allowed .",
    "this is due exactly to the effect mentioned above , namely that the bound on @xmath22 is stronger than the one on @xmath3 , and the branches correspond to those areas , where the phase of the new contributions is such that it does nt modify @xmath22 strongly .",
    "this is nicely seen in the comparison of both figures in the @xmath237 plane , and should actually be a general effect of any model .",
    "notice , that , due to the leptophobic character of the @xmath2 boson , the possible modifications of both branching fractions are not very large in comparison to the lht model . also , this figure nicely demonstrates how the allowed region decreases as the @xmath2 mass is increased .",
    "a projection onto the @xmath8-@xmath7 plane . measuring both branching fraction allows to unambiguously determine both the phase as well as the magnitude of the new physics contribution .",

    "the result of this exercise is shown in fig .",
    "[ bdmumu ] .",
    "interestingly , this result makes a suppression of the branching ratio seem much more likely than an enhancement , and , in any case , a strong enhancement of this branching ratio would unambiguously rule out the minimal 331 model .",
    "a similar result can be obtained for @xmath241 using the corresponding bounds from @xmath20 , which we have added in figure [ bdmumu ] .",
    "also in this case , we find that there is not much room for a significant enhancement .",
    "investigating now also the implications for a suppression of these branching fractions , we find that these can be larger , but a very large effect here is also excluded .    finally , let us comment on the relation between @xmath242 and @xmath243 derived in @xcite .",
    "here , one finds : @xmath244 this relation has the advantage that the form factors @xmath245 drop out , and that therefore the uncertainties are reduced significantly .",
    "it is valid with @xmath246 in the sm and any extension that has an mfv structure . in our model , however , we can expect significant departures from this relation , i.e. a value of @xmath247 that is not necessary unity . exploring the possible violation of this relation ,",
    "we are , of course interested in the range that @xmath247 can obtain . for this",
    "we scan over the entire allowed parameter range to obtain all possible values of @xmath247 .",
    "the result of this investigation is shown in figure [ bmumudmq ] , where the constraints from @xmath83 , @xmath20 and @xmath23 are all included .",
    "we find that the sm relation can be broken by about @xmath248 , with @xmath247 ranging from @xmath249 , while this range seems to be rather independent of the @xmath2 mass .",
    "it is clear that we could have expected these strong modifications , since the mass differences are significantly more sensitive to the new contributions due to the leptophobic structure . as a general conclusion to this section , we can therefore state just this : in the minimal 331 model",
    ", we expect there to be stronger modifications in any quantity , in which leptons are not involved , i.e. in particular in the cp - violating asymmetries measuring @xmath41 and @xmath12 , as well as the mass differences .    allowed range for the branching ratio @xmath242 obtained from @xmath83 and @xmath23 and for the branching ratio @xmath243 from @xmath20 .,title=\"fig:\",height=177 ] allowed range for the branching ratio @xmath242 obtained from @xmath83 and @xmath23 and for the branching ratio @xmath243 from @xmath20 .,title=\"fig:\",height=177 ]     deviation from unity of the factor @xmath247 introduced in the text , as depending on @xmath99 . , height=188 ]",
    "we conclude our numerical analysis with the compilation of table [ obs ] , where we have collected the possible enhancements and suppressions in several observable quantities scanning the input parameters in a manner similar to the analysis of @xmath247 above .",
    "we observe , that the value of @xmath23 , as obtained from the combined @xmath250 decays @xcite can receive significant modifications , as well as both leptonic decays @xmath251 which may also be rather strongly modified by the new contributions .",
    "note , that in all these cases , there are , in particular , very strict lower bounds , valid for all of the @xmath2 mass range , that can not be circumvented .",
    "the stronger enhancement of the @xmath172 branching fraction as compared to the one of @xmath252 is a reflection of the fact that @xmath253 is larger than @xmath254 by a factor of 3 .",
    "also , a general feature of many models is that the decay @xmath172 is subject to weaker modifications than the @xmath8 decay , which is clearly not the case in the minimal 331 model .",
    "we therefore show the contour in the observable plane of these two decays in fig .",
    "[ keeknunu ] , which displays this feature rather nicely .",
    "also , this contour allows an immediate test of the 331 model , if both decays are measured .",

    "this allowed us to analyze a larger set of observable quantities than has been done before . here , we have concentrated on the contributions from the exchange of the new @xmath2 gauge boson , which transmits fcnc processes at tree level .",
    "we have used the experimentally measured quantities @xmath3 , @xmath22 , @xmath5 and @xmath209 to constrain the size of the new mixing matrix elements , depending on the mass of the @xmath2 boson .",

    "these upper bounds depend on the @xmath2 mass and can be used to exclude the minimal 331 model , or at least certain ranges of the @xmath2 mass .",
    "let us summarize the results of the different steps in our analysis as follows    * fcnc processes are very well suited to constrain and explore the minimal 331 model , since the new contributions to ewp observables appear only at loop level , while the new fcnc effects appear already at tree level and are thus more significant .",
    "* in the mixing sector of the neutral kaon system , we find that the imaginary part of @xmath256 is much stronger constrained than the real part . therefore ,",
    "if we would like to saturate these bounds , we can take a purely real or imaginary @xmath257 . * concerning @xmath5 , we find that modifications to both observables can take place as enhancements or suppressions in an equal manner , and that the measurements already significantly constrain the respective mixing matrix elements .",
    "we find , however that the bounds from @xmath23 are somewhat stronger than those from @xmath83 , depending on the relative phase of the new contributions .",
    "additionally , the phase @xmath258 , as measured in the mixing induced asymmetry of @xmath259 can be large , since it is basically unconstrained , as of now . at the same time",

    "* there are potentially significant modifications in both @xmath164 effects , depending on the phase structure of the new mixing matrix and , of course , the @xmath2 mass .",
    "in fact , measuring both decays allows one to unambiguously determine the new phase as well as the absolute value of the combination @xmath260",
    ". the present experimental central value for @xmath261 can be reached , but only for rather low values of @xmath99 . also , we point out , that there are two `` branches '' in the @xmath262 plane , similar to the signature in the littlest higgs model with t - parity , but the possible enhancements are significantly smaller than in that model . on the other hand , the signature in @xmath172 is stronger than in the lht model , in particular in relation to the enhancement of @xmath8 .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that vector and axial - vector contributions partially cancel out in the @xmath167 difference , to which @xmath8 is sensitive , while the individually large modification of the vector component affects @xmath172 .",
    "* next , we have then analyzed the impact of the bounds from @xmath5 on the decays @xmath239 . here",
    ", we find that large enhancements seem impossible , while significant suppressions of both branching ratios can be obtained .",
    "* finally , we have briefly investigated some correlations and relations between several decays that hold in the sm , but are expected to be violated in the minimal 331 model , in particular , if new cp violating phases are present .",
    "for example , we find that the relation @xcite between @xmath5 and @xmath263 can be rather strongly violated by up to @xmath248 . *",
    "the most general conclusion to draw from this analysis is that , in general , we expect stronger modifications in those observables , that do not involve leptonic couplings , since these are suppressed in comparison to the quark coupling . in this context , the phase @xmath12 as measured in the mixing induced asymmetry @xmath259 becomes extremely interesting .",
    "finally , we would like to point out that the minimal 331 model is only one example of a model with an additional @xmath2 boson , but has many features that any such model should share , such as the correspondence of the bounds from @xmath264 to effects in the rare decays , which will stay the same in any such model , subject to small modifications from different lepton couplings . here",
    ", we would again like to point out that the lepton coupling to the @xmath2 is suppressed in our model by a factor of @xmath265 , so that stronger effects should be expected in a general model . on the other hand ,",
    "the illustrated patterns in the rare decay sector remain the same , in particular the possibility of obtaining information on phase structure and absolute values from measurements of both @xmath266 decays .",
    "the same is true for the correlation between @xmath5 and @xmath267 , implicitly stated in eqs .",

    "<S> we begin by studying the bounds obtained from quantities such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 as well as @xmath6 , and go on to explore the implications for several clean rare decay channels , namely the decays @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we find sizeable effects in all these decays , but the most interesting quantity turns out to be the @xmath11 mixing phase @xmath12 , as measured in the mixing induced cp asymmetry of @xmath13 , which can be large . in general , we find effects in purely hadronic channels to be larger than in ( semi-)leptonic ones , due to a suppression of the @xmath2-lepton couplings .    </S>",
