    "a major interest of modern quantum optics is to devise ways to modify and control the radiative properties of atoms .",
    "this may be achieved by changing the environment , so that the atoms interact with a modified set of vacuum modes .",
    "one such modified vacuum is provided by the cavity environment @xcite , where the electromagnetic modes are concentrated around the cavity resonant frequency .",
    "the coupling of the atoms to the modified electromagnetic vacuum is therefore frequency dependent . for an excited atom located inside such a cavity ,",
    "the cavity mode is the only one available to the atom for emission .",
    "if the atomic transition is in resonance with the cavity , the spontaneous emission rate into the particular cavity mode is enhanced @xcite ; otherwise , it is inhibited @xcite .",
    "when the atom is strongly driven by a laser field , the atom - laser system may be considered to form a new dressed atom @xcite whose energy - level structure is intensity dependent .",
    "for such a coherently driven two - level atom placed inside a cavity , theoretical investigations have predicted a phenomenological richness which is not found in the absence of the strong driving field  for example , dynamical suppression of the spontaneous emission rate @xcite , population inversion in both bare and dressed states basis @xcite , and distortion and narrowing of the mollow triplet @xcite .",
    "all these features are very sensitive to the cavity resonance frequency because of the cavity enhancement of the dressed atomic transitions .",
    "recently , lange and walther @xcite have observed the dynamical suppression of spontaneous emission in a microwave cavity . in the optical - frequency regime ,",
    "_ @xcite have also reported experimental studies of the effects of cavity detuning on the radiative properties of a coherently driven two - level atom .",
    "they have shown that the atomic fluorescence of a strongly driven two - level atom is enhanced when the cavity frequency is tuned to one of the sidebands of the mollow fluorescence triplet , whereas it is inhibited by tuning to the other sideband .",
    "the enhancement of atomic resonance fluorescence at one sideband is a direct demonstration of population inversion .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the dynamical modification of the resonance fluorescence of a coherently driven v - type three - level atom coupled to a frequency - tunable , single - mode cavity in the bad cavity limit .",
    "we demonstrate that the atomic populations , fluorescence spectrum and absorption spectrum can be strongly controlled and manipulated by tuning the cavity frequency . in section 2",
    ", we derive a cavity - modified master equation for the atomic density - matrix operator from the full master equation by adiabatically eliminating the cavity variables in the bad cavity limit . for simplicity , we restrict attention to the situation where the laser frequency is tuned to the mean bohr frequency of the excited states .",
    "the results obtained here are basic to the whole paper , and the equations derived in this section are used to calculate _ all _ the numerical results presented .",
    "the first part of section 3 is devoted to discussing the atomic population distribution in the bare state representation .",
    "it is pointed out that significant population inversions can be achieved . in the second part of this section , we analyse the equations for the populations in the dressed state basis , with particular emphasis on the high field limit .",
    "we find that the dressed state populations obey rate equations , with atomic transition rates that are strongly dependent on the rabi frequency and the cavity resonance frequency . under certain conditions ,",
    "the population may also be inverted in the dressed - state basis .",
    "the plots of the dressed state populations against the cavity frequency  laser frequency detuning are used to provide a semi - quantitative understanding of the phenomena described in the subsequent sections . in section 4",
    "we study the cavity effects on the resonance fluorescence spectra of this system .",
    "it is shown that dynamical control of the populations and fluorescence spectrum by adjustment of the cavity resonance frequency and rabi frequency is possible .",
    "peak suppression and line narrowing phenomena are also revealed . in section 5",
    "we briefly consider the absorption of a weak tunable probe field transmitted through this system , and in the last section we give a summary .",

    "here we also assume that the atomic dipole moments @xmath24 and @xmath25 are orthogonal to each other , so that there is no spontaneously generated quantum interference @xcite resulting from the cross coupling between the transitions @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "for simplicity in the resulting expressions , we assume @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 in what follows .",
    "we assume that the atom - cavity coupling is weak and the cavity has a low - q value , so that @xmath32 ( the bad cavity limit ) .",
    "this condition implies that the cavity mode response to the standard vacuum reservoir is much faster than that produced by its interaction with the atom .",
    "then the atom always experiences the cavity mode in the state induced by the vacuum reservoir , and this permits one to eliminate the variables containing the cavity field operators adiabatically , giving rise to a reduced master equation for the atomic variables only .",

    "so the atomic transition rates @xmath99 and @xmath100 are only dependent on the spontaneous emission rate and independent of the cavity frequency . as the other seven double - channels are still open to the cavity mode , this means that for the other transitions from @xmath101 to @xmath102 , a cavity photon can be generated , but it will be very strongly damped under the bad - cavity assumption .",

    "these plots have been obtained by a numerical solution of equations ( [ dm ] ) , but we have found that the equations ( [ dpops ] ) provide an excellent approximation in the strong field limit .",
    "it is evident that if the excited levels of the v - atom are degenerate ( @xmath109 ) or nearly degenerate ( @xmath110 ) , the transitions @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) , whereas the rate of transitions out of the dressed state @xmath105 , @xmath113 is nonzero .",

    "the interaction of the atom with the privileged cavity mode is enhanced , and the atom predominately ( since @xmath154 ) emits a photon into the cavity mode , characterized by the @xmath155 term in @xmath97 , besides radiating a photon into the background , represented by the term @xmath156 in @xmath97 . by contrast , the other transitions describing atomic emission of a photon into the cavity mode are far off resonance with the cavity ( since @xmath132 ) , so the atom can only radiate a photon into the background . as a consequence , the symmetry of the transitions from @xmath106 to @xmath157and from @xmath107 to latexmath:[$%    dressed state @xmath106 over that in @xmath107 .    when the cavity frequency is tuned to satisfy @xmath141 , the atomic transition rate @xmath92 at the cavity frequency @xmath159 is resonantly enhanced , and the other three rates @xmath97 , @xmath96 and @xmath93 are decreased . in this case , if @xmath160 , the other five transition rates are much smaller than @xmath93 .",

    "the results may be understood from equations ( [ center ] )  ( [ out2 ] ) .",
    "it is not difficult to see from eqs .",
    "( [ inner1 ] ) and ( [ inner2 ] ) that the inner sidebands @xmath218 will be very small , as @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "hence the central line and the outer sidebands will dominate . this is evident in all the spectra of fig . 5 , but particularly for frame ( a ) where the inner sidebands are hardly visible . when the cavity frequency @xmath71 , the spectrum is a symmetric , mollow - like triplet , whilst the lower - frequency outer sideband is enhanced and the higher - frequency one suppressed when @xmath142 and @xmath221 .",
    "these features are similar to those of a laser - dressed two - level atom coupled to such a cavity field @xcite .",
    "the enhancement and suppression of the sidebands is due to the cavity modification of the transition rates @xmath211 and @xmath222 .",
    "the former decreases while the latter increases for @xmath223 .",
    "therefore , the enhanced spectral line of the outer sidebands is narrowed whilst the suppressed one is broadened . for large values of the detuning , shown in frame ( d ) , the spectrum reverts to a symmetric form .",

    "6 where the values @xmath225 and @xmath226 are taken .",
    "contrary to the spectra of fig .",
    "5 , the inner sidebands are most pronounced for the @xmath71 situation whereas the outer spectral lines are almost invisible .",
    "tuning the cavity frequency may also change the spectral profile : the higher - frequency sideband is somewhat enhanced when @xmath227 and @xmath143 . as we discussed above , in the limit of @xmath228",
    "the dressed state populations @xmath151 and @xmath229 are close to zero while @xmath230 , and all the populations are barely dependent on the cavity frequency .",
    "it is obvious from eqs .",
    "( [ inner1 ] ) and ( [ inner2 ] ) that the @xmath218 are mainly determined by the cavity - frequency - dependent decay rates , @xmath231 and @xmath232 . for the parameters of fig . 6 , we have @xmath233 , @xmath234 and @xmath235 .",
    "therefore , @xmath236 , which implies that the lower - frequency peak is lower than the higher - frequency sideband .    in fig . 7 , we take the values @xmath237 which corresponds to the populations shown in frame ( d ) of fig .",
    "4 . for @xmath128 the bulk of the population",
    "is concentrated in state @xmath238 and there is little population in states @xmath239and @xmath240 hence the outer sidebands are weak in amplitude , whilst the inner sidebands and the central peak are pronounced .",
    "tuning the laser to @xmath241 or @xmath119 increases the relative amplitude of the high frequency or low frequency inner sideband respectively . as @xmath65 is increased through @xmath142 to @xmath242 the population in state @xmath243 increases , whilst that in state @xmath244 decreases .",
    "the low frequency outer sideband consequently increases in amplitude at the expence of the amplitude of the high frequency outer sideband .    for the general case , by inspection of equations ( [ drates ] ) for the cavity - induced decay rates",
    "@xmath196 , one finds in the limit @xmath245 that if the cavity is tuned to resonance with the driving laser @xmath246 , the rates are the same as those in free space @xcite , except for @xmath247 and @xmath248 being replaced by @xmath249 and @xmath250 respectively .",
    "this reflects the fact that the cavity - induced spontaneous emission rates can be greatly suppressed by increasing the rabi frequency @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "8(a ) for @xmath225 and @xmath251 , the inner and outer sidebands are broadened , whilst the central peak is narrowed .",
    "we illustrate the spectra for @xmath142 and @xmath143 in frames 8(b ) and 8(c ) , respectively , where asymmetric spectral features are exhibited .",
    "the previous explanations apply to this case as well , that is , the enhancement and suppression of the spectral lines stems from the cavity modification of the dressed state population distribution and decay rates .",

    "accordingly , the lower - frequency peaks are higher than their counterparts in the high frequency side .",
    "it is also natural to study the absorption spectrum of a weak , tunable probe field transmitted through the system , as we would expect this to be largely determined by the dressed states populations .",
    "the frequency @xmath253 of the driving laser is kept fixed , and the absorption is measured as a function of the frequency @xmath254 of the probe laser , measured from the laser frequency , @xmath255 the absorption spectrum is given by @xmath256 \\rangle + \\langle \\left [ a_{10}(t+\\tau ) , a_{01}(t)\\right ] \\rangle \\right\\ } _ { t\\rightarrow \\infty } e^{i\\nu \\tau } d\\tau .\\ ] ] we present only a brief discussion of this phenomenon here . as for the resonance fluorescence spectrum , we may use the quantum regression theorem to express the probe spectrum as @xmath257 _ { z = i\\nu } \\ ] ] where @xmath258 u\\left ( \\tau \\right ) \\,\\text{and } g^{\\prime } \\left ( \\tau \\right ) = u^{\\dag } \\left ( \\tau \\right ) \\left [ \\rho \\left ( \\infty \\right ) \\left|",

    "however , for brevity , we concentrate on a qualitative discussion here .",
    "figure 9 , frames ( a)(c ) , shows the spectra for @xmath259 when most of the population resides in the dressed states @xmath243 and @xmath260 and the population in state @xmath115 is practically zero , although the latter does show a very small maximum for zero detuning , @xmath261 the case @xmath71 is shown in frame ( a ) . because there is no population in state @xmath238 the absorption spectrum is largely determined by the transitions between the outer two levels from @xmath262 to @xmath263 at frequency @xmath264 and by the transitions between the inner two levels @xmath265 to @xmath260 at frequency @xmath266 for example , from figure 4 , following the arguments of cohen - tannoudji and reynaud @xcite , one can write down an approximate expression for the weight of the line at @xmath267 as @xmath268 a negative value for @xmath269 representing amplification , and a positive value absorption . it is easily seen that @xmath270 since the populations in levels @xmath243 and @xmath262 are equal when @xmath128 the difference between absorption and amplification is determined by the value of the rates .",
    "a similar argument gives @xmath271 using the expressions ( [ trar ] ) for the rates , we find @xmath272 these arguments explain the main features of the plot presented in frame ( a ) . in frame ( b ) , we tune the driving laser to @xmath142 which has the effect of significantly increasing the population in @xmath262 and decreasing that in level @xmath273 the magnitudes of the absorption at @xmath274 and the emission at @xmath275 are thus greatly increased .",
    "the difference between the populations @xmath243 and @xmath244 reaches a maximum for @xmath276 .",
    "this value of @xmath65 is assumed in frame ( c ) , where the greatest absorption / emission occurs .    in frames",
    "( d)(f ) , we change the parameters to @xmath277 the populations for this case , whose behaviour varies greatly from the previous case , are shown in frame ( c ) of fig .",
    "now we have a large population in state @xmath238 and only small populations in states @xmath243 and @xmath278 the absorption spectra are thus quite different : the strongest features occur at @xmath279 and have a strong dispersive element , whereas the features at @xmath280 are relatively insignificant . tuning the driving laser to @xmath281 or @xmath276 again",
    "has the effect of greatly increasing the strengths of the absorptions / emissions .",
    "the first three frames of fig .",
    "10 show the absorption spectra for @xmath282 and the second three frames the absorption spectra for @xmath283 in these two cases , changing the detuning @xmath65 has a greater effect than in the cases of the previous figure .",
    "this is particularly true in the last three frames , where it can be seen that changing the detuning can cause a switch from strong absorption to strong emission , and vice - versa .",
    "we have investigated , in the bad cavity limit , the resonance fluorescence of a v - type three - level atom strongly driven by a laser field and weakly coupled to a cavity mode , and we have demonstrated how the fluorescence may be controlled and manipulated by varying the cavity and rabi frequencies . a strong dependency of the bare and dressed state populations on the cavity resonant frequency is shown . population inversion in both the bare and the dressed - state bases can be achieved for appropriate atom - cavity coupling constants , cavity resonant frequency and high driving intensities .",
    "these population inversions result from the enhanced atom - cavity interaction when the cavity is tuned to resonance with the atomic dressed - state transition .",
    "the resultant fluorescence spectrum is also strongly dependent on the cavity frequency .",
    "when the cavity is in resonant with the driving field , the spectrum is symmetric .",
    "specifically , if the excited levels of the atom are degenerate ( or near - degenerate ) , a mollow - like triplet is exhibited with central line narrowing , but the spectrum has a two - peak structure if the level splitting is much greater than the laser intensity .",
    "otherwise , the spectrum consists of five peaks .",
    "when the cavity is tuned to resonance with one of the spectral sidebands , some of the spectral lines may be enhanced and others suppressed , and so the spectrum is asymmetric .",
    "dynamical line - narrowing and peak - suppression of certain spectral lines can be achieved by increasing the laser intensity .",
    "we have also demonstrated that a large degree of control and manipulation of the probe absorption spectrum can be achieved by tuning the cavity ."
