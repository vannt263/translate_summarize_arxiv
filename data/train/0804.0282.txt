    "recent high - resolution n - body simulations based on cold dark matter ( cdm ) theory highlight a so - called missing satellite problem , i.e. , cdm predicts the existence of more than several hundred dark satellites ( or subhalos ) in a galaxy - sized halo , in sharp contrast to the observed number of about 20 milky way satellites ( e.g. , diemand et al .",
    "2007 for recent studies ) . to clarify this issue ,",
    "gravitational lensing offers us an invaluable insight into such numerous cdm subhalos that reside in lensing galaxies .",
    "in particular , anomalous flux ratios in lensed qsos , namely those hardly reproduced by any lens models with a smooth density distribution , are of special interest , since lens substructures are able to cause such flux anomalies ( e.g. , metcalf & madau 2001 ; chiba 2002 ) .    here",
    ", we report on our subaru observations of a sample of quadruple lenses with anomalous flux ratios , based on mid - infrared imaging and integral - field spectroscopy .",
    "mid - infrared imaging of lenses is advantageous because the flux is free from differential extinction among different images and it is also free from microlensing by stars .",
    "integral - field spectroscopy provides both spatial and spectral information simultaneously on each lensed image .",
    "we select eight qsos with four lensed images , pg1115@xmath0080 , b1422@xmath0231 , mg0414@xmath00534 , q2237@xmath0030 , h1413@xmath0117 , hs0810@xmath02554 , and wfi2026@xmath14536 for mid - infrared imaging , and rxj1131@xmath11231 for integral - field spectroscopy .",
    "we briefly report the results for pg1115@xmath0080 and b1422@xmath0231 ( chiba et al . 2005 ) and rxj1131@xmath11231 ( sugai et al . 2007 ) ; those for other targets will be published elsewhere ( minezaki et al .",
    "2008 in preparation ) .",
    "we present new limits on substructure in the observed lensed systems and implications for a missing satellite problem are discussed .",
    "pg1115@xmath0080 at redshift @xmath2 and b1422@xmath0231 at @xmath3 are lensed by foreground ellipticals at @xmath4 and 0.34 , respectively .",
    "the former lens system holds the closely separated pair of images a1 and a2 with a separation of @xmath5 , and this configuration emerges if the qso is close to and inside a fold caustic provided by the lens ( figure 1 ) . the latter shows the colinear , three highly magnified images , a , b , and c , and this configuration emerges if the qso is close to and inside a cusp caustic . in such lens systems associated with a fold or cusp caustic , there exists a universal relation between the image fluxes , i.e. , a2@xmath6a1@xmath7 or ( a@xmath0c)@xmath6b@xmath7 , whereas the observed optical flux ratios violate these rules significantly , a2@xmath6a1@xmath8 and ( a@xmath0c)@xmath6b@xmath9 .",
    "the mid - infrared imaging of pg1115@xmath0080 and b1422@xmath0231 was carried out on the nights of ut 2004 may 5 and 6 , using the cooled mid - infrared camera and spectrometer ( comics ) .",
    "the field of view is @xmath10 and the pixel scale is @xmath11 pixel@xmath12 .",
    "we used the n11.7 filter , whose effective wavelength and bandwidth are @xmath13 m and @xmath14 m , respectively .",
    "the fwhm of psf was @xmath15 at small airmass .",
    "the observed mid - infrared waveband corresponds to the near - infrared waveband in the rest frame , and its flux is dominated by thermal radiation from hot dust located at the innermost region of a dust torus .",
    "the inner radius of a dust torus , which is determined by the highest sublimation temperature of dust ( @xmath16 ) and the uv luminosity of a qso central engine , is generally much larger than einstein radii of foreground stars , so that the observed mid - infrared flux is free from microlensing effects .",
    "rxj1131@xmath11231 is unique in its low redshift of a source image @xmath17 lensed by an elliptical at @xmath18 .",
    "the lens shows three roughly co - linear images , a , b , and , c , being characteristic of a cusp singularity , where a is brightest ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the observed flux ratios , ( b@xmath0c)@xmath6a@xmath19 in the @xmath20 band and @xmath21 in the @xmath22 band , deviate significantly from the rule ( b@xmath0c)@xmath6a@xmath7 .    using the ifs mode of the kyoto tridimensional spectrograph ii ( kyoto 3dii ) , we observed rxj1131@xmath11231 on the night of ut 2005 february 8 .",
    "the ifs mode uses an array of @xmath23 lenslets , enabling us to obtain spectra of @xmath24 spatial elements . the spectral range from @xmath25 to @xmath26",
    "was observed in each of two one - hour exposures . with the spatial sampling of @xmath27 lenslet@xmath28 , the field of view of @xmath29 covered the three bright lensed images .",
    "we measured the emission - line fluxes of both the blr h@xmath30 and the nlr [ oiii]@xmath314959,5007 for images a , b , and c simultaneously .",
    "the h@xmath30 and [ oiii ] lines are very close in wavelength , so that the effect of differential reddening between them is negligible .",
    "m for pg1115@xmath0080 ( top ) and b1422@xmath0231 ( bottom ) .",
    "the north is up and the east is left .",
    "right : smooth lens models for these systems , where solid and dotted lines denote the caustics and critical curves , respectively , and filled circles indicate the source positions.,height=340 ]    the mid - infrared images at @xmath32 m of pg1115@xmath0080 and b1422@xmath0231 are presented in figure 1 .",
    "it is evident that the lensed images in concern , ( a1 , a2 ) and ( a , b , c ) , respectively , are clearly detected and well separated from each other . the mid - infrared flux ratios are given as a2@xmath6a1@xmath33 , b@xmath6a1@xmath34 , and c@xmath6a1@xmath35 for pg1115@xmath0080 , and ( a@xmath0c@xmath36b@xmath37 , a@xmath6b@xmath38 , and c@xmath6b@xmath39 for b1422@xmath0231 .",
    "this suggests that the mid - infrared flux ratio for a2@xmath6a1 of pg1115@xmath0080 is consistent with the prediction of a smooth lens model ( @xmath40 ) , while the optical flux ratio is much smaller ( @xmath41 ) , and that the mid - infrared flux ratios for ( a , b , c ) images of b1422@xmath0231 remain anomalous , contrary to the prediction of a smooth lens .",
    "based on the dust reverberation method for estimating the size of a dust torus ( minezaki et al .",
    "2004 ) , we obtain an angular size @xmath42 of a source image as @xmath43 arcsec and @xmath44 arcsec for pg1115@xmath0080 and b1422@xmath0231 , respectively . for pg1115@xmath0080 , any substructure causing its optical anomalous flux ratio a2@xmath6a1 should have a small einstein angle @xmath45 compared to @xmath42 , because its mid - infrared ratio remains unaffected .",
    "this suggests that a substructure mass inside @xmath45 , denoted as @xmath46 , should be smaller than 20  m@xmath47 , being comparable to the mass of a star , i.e. , microlensing causes an optical anomalous flux ratio . for b1422@xmath0231 , the presence of flux anomaly even in mid - infrared waveband suggests @xmath48 m@xmath47 , i.e. , lensing by a subhalo is most likely .",

    "right : smooth lens model for this lens system.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] 1231 for image a ( solid line ) , b ( dashed line ) , and c ( dot - dashed line ) , where each has been extracted with an 8-lenslet , i.e. , a circular aperture with a diameter @xmath49 .",
    "right : smooth lens model for this lens system.,title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    figure 2 shows the kyoto 3dii spectra of rxj1131@xmath11231 for three bright images a , b , and c. it is interesting to remark that images b and c in [ oiii ] show nearly the same fluxes relative to image a , as expected from a smooth model at its cusp singularity .",
    "thus , the absence of substructure lensing effects on this nlr [ oiii ] sets important limits on the mass of any substructures along the line of sight , as @xmath50 m@xmath47 .",
    "in contrast , the h@xmath30 line emission , which originates from the blr , shows an anomaly in the flux ratio between images b and c , i.e. , a factor two smaller c@xmath6b ratio than predicted by smooth - lens models .",
    "the ratio of a@xmath6b in the h@xmath30 line is well reproduced .",
    "the anomalous c@xmath6b ratio for the h@xmath30 line is caused most likely by microlensing of image c , with @xmath51 m@xmath47 for the mass of a substructure near image c. we have also found the slight difference of the h@xmath30 line profile in image a from those in the other images , which suggests the presence of a small microlensing effect on image a.",
    "in addition to the above lens systems , we have already observed , using comics , mg0414@xmath00534 , q2237@xmath0030 , h1413@xmath0117 , and hs0810@xmath02554 , and the calibration and analysis are underway . our final target for mid - infrared imaging of quadruple lenses , wfi2026@xmath14536 , is scheduled for observation using gemini - south this year .",
    "our preliminary statistical model implies that about 30  % of the lens systems ( @xmath52 out of 8) show a flux anomaly with @xmath53  % , if subhalos are modeled by tidally - truncated singular isothermal spheres with a mass function predicted by the n - body simulations .",
    "once the concrete observational information for all of these targets is ready , we will be able to set a more reliable constraint on the abundance of cdm subhalos .",
