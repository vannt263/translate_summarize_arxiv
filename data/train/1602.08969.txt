    "magnificent seven is a group of isolated neutron stars emitting quasi - thermal x - ray and optical radiation and situated at distances below 500 pc . they have rotation periods in the 311 s range and magnetic fields and characteristic ages , estimated from the magneto - dipole braking formula , of ( 13)@xmath6 g and ( 14)@xmath7 yrs , respectively .",
    "so , these are fairly old nearby neutron stars , which , presumably , are seen solely due to their residual heat , but which all have magnetic fields higher than those of typical rotation - powered pulsars .",
    "quite naturally , these stars were viewed as prime examples of objects , which are heated additionally by decay of their magnetic fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "further evidence in favor of this neutron star heating mechanism was presented by @xcite , who have shown that there was a correlation between surface temperature and dipole magnetic field for such diverse objects as soft gamma repeaters , anomalous x - ray pulsars , isolated neutron stars , and rotation - powered pulsars .",
    "@xcite have performed detailed modelling of magneto - thermal evolution of neutron stars . in these simulations ,",
    "magnetic field decay was able to provide enough heat to explain even the hottest sources such as magnetars .",
    "clearly , in order to obtain effective decay of the magnetic field the electrical conductivity of matter must be relatively low . to achieve that @xcite have assumed that the nuclear pasta layer at the boundary of the inner crust with the core possessed a high level of disorder .",
    "accordingly , they used impurity scattering with a very high impurity parameter @xmath8 ( @xmath9 in the rest of the crust ) to model this situation .",
    "later on such a high value of the impurity parameter was justified in a molecular dynamics simulation of the nuclear pasta layer by @xcite .",
    "for instance , in the lasagna phase , these authors have discovered a very peculiar defect , which looks like a spiral staircase leading from one lasagna `` floor '' to the next and which may be responsible for @xmath10 .    while this conjecture is certainly exciting , it brings about a number of questions .",
    "firstly , one may wonder , how come there is so little disorder at lower and higher densities and so much disorder in the narrow density range from @xmath11 to @xmath12 g @xmath13 .",
    "secondly , the high disorder layer then must be present also in weakly magnetized neutron stars , where it is not required by observations .",
    "thirdly , as shown by @xcite , it is more economical to place a heat source of magnetars in more shallow layers in order to avoid excessive energy loss via neutrinos , though these considerations did not take into account proportional worsening of the electron thermal conductivity in the high disorder layer .",
    "ultimately , the question becomes whether it is possible to organize a fast field decay by more conventional means ?    in a crystalline neutron star crust charge and heat are transported by degenerate electrons .",
    "the main mechanism impeding their transport is emission and absorption of lattice vibrations ( phonons ) by electrons .",
    "phonons in a magnetized coulomb crystal of ions ( or `` magnetized phonons '' ) are fundamentally different from the field - free case @xcite . in the absence of the field , the phonons are acoustic",
    ", i.e. their frequency depends linearly on the wave vector . in the presence of the field , a soft mode with a quadratic dependence of the frequency on",
    "the wave vector appears .",
    "the appearance of the soft mode can be understood by referring to a simple problem of a charged oscillator with frequency @xmath14 ( mass @xmath15 and charge @xmath16 ) brought into a uniform magnetic field @xmath17 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "its frequency becomes @xmath18 where @xmath19 .",
    "assuming that @xmath20 , i.e. it represents an ion frequency in an acoustic phonon with sound speed @xmath21 , the square root can be expanded at small wave vectors @xmath22 , which results in the quadratic dependence @xmath23 .",
    "clearly , the mode is softer for stronger magnetic fields .",
    "this is precisely what one obtains if a lattice dynamics problem is solved for the coulomb crystal in the magnetic field .",
    "the soft mode has a dramatic effect on the thermodynamic properties of the crystal at low temperatures . due to its low frequency",
    "it is much easier to excite , which produces , for instance , an increase of the crystal heat capacity per particle by a factor of @xmath24 at temperature @xmath25 and phonon magnetization @xmath26 ( cf .",

    "it appears that the soft mode will affect the effective rate of phonon emission / absorption by electrons in a comparable way .",

    "for realistic materials , @xmath170 and therefore , our consideration is valid quantitatively at densities higher than the left - most dotted line for each field .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath171 , i.e. moderate and weak magnetization of crystal phonons .",
    "as already mentioned , the case of electrons on the ground landau level , and thus @xmath172 , requires a separate consideration .",
    "additionally , at sufficiently low temperatures one has to take into account bandgaps in the electron spectrum of the crystal ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for details ) , whereas we use the free - electron approximation .",
    "we have calculated electrical and thermal conductivities of degenerate electrons emitting and absorbing phonons in a strongly magnetized crystalline neutron star crust .",
    "the novel features of our study include _",
    "( i ) _ an account of modification of the phonon properties in the magnetic field and _ ( ii ) _ an application of a generalized variational method to solve the boltzmann kinetic equation in the magnetic field with due consideration of the electron - phonon process inelasticity .",
    "our results apply at weak and intermediate phonon magnetization @xmath173 and indicate a significant growth of electrical and thermal resistivities at quantum and intermediate temperatures @xmath0 in a broad range of chemical compositions and mass densities of matter .",
    "this effect is due to an appearance of a soft phonon mode in the magnetized ion coulomb crystal , which is easier to excite in an interaction with an electron than an ordinary acoustic phonon in the field - free case .    at @xmath172 our results hint at an even stronger increase of the electrical and thermal resistivities , however",
    ", a detailed analysis of the problem is needed under the assumption that electrons populate only the ground landau level .",
    "these results are important for quantitative modelling of cooling of neutron stars and evolution of their magnetic fields .",
    "in particular , they imply an accelerated decay of the magnetic field in the outer neutron star crust accompanied by an additional heat release .",
