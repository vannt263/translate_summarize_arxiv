    "in recent years the cooperative interaction of @xmath0 two level radiators with cavity electromagnetic field ( emf ) was in the attention of many experimental and theoretical researches @xcite .",
    "this it is connected with the big application of two - level system as a q - bit in quantum processing of information . in many cases , distinguished ensembles of q - bits",
    "are used for the realization of quantum registers @xcite . according to the principle of indistinguishable between the radiators @xcite ,",
    "@xmath1 states of @xmath0 two - level atoms can be reduced to @xmath2 states in the processes of coherent excitation . as a particular case ,",
    "the cooperative effect between two undistinguished radiators occurs , due to the fact that two states of the single excitation ( the atom @xmath3 in an excited state and @xmath4 in the ground and respectively atom @xmath3 in the ground state and @xmath4 in the excited state ) are considered as a same collective state .",
    "it is not difficult to observe that this number of collective excitation drastically is reduced with increasing the number of atoms .",
    "it is attractive from physical points of view to apply this principle to the atoms placed in coupled cavities .",
    "combination of atom - cavity physics and photon systems offers new opportunities in this field for a better device functionality and for probing of emulators of condensed - matter systems . in ref .",
    "@xcite a single - polariton approximation was proposed for the study of the periodical photonic systems . within this approximation",
    "the authors of this paper have applied bloch states to the uniformly tuned jaynes - cummings - hubbard model to analytically determine the energy - band structure . in the work @xcite it was studied the photon - blockade - induced mott transitions and xy spin models in coupled cavity arrays .",
    "it was found that a range of many - body effects such as a mott transition for polaritons obeying mixed statistics could be observed in the optical systems of individual addressable coupled cavity arrays interacting with two - level systems .",
    "exploited first in systems like photons , atoms , or ions , the entanglement is becoming more and more attainable in condensed matter physics .",
    "as follows from the distinctive description of doped cavities @xcite,@xcite , the analytical descriptions of the quantum systems become complicated due to the increasing number of degrees of freedom of such systems by increasing the number of cavities in the system . in this case the number of degrees of freedoms is connected with the numbers of coupled quantum oscillators : atoms and cavity - modes . considering that the excitations of atoms and cavity modes become indistinguishable , we can use the symmetry transformation of such system considering the invariance of the states after the actions of the operation of corresponded symmetry group .",
    "for example , the wave function of the single excitation of the radiator or mode inside of one of the three coupled cavities must remain in the same quantum state after the rotation around the axis of symmetry with angle @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "as it is observed , the number of degrees of freedom of the system formed from three coupled cavities is reduced as in the dicke problem for three radiators situated in the volume with the dimension less than the radiation wavelength . in sec.[sec:2",
    "] we have proposed to use the symmetry principle for reducing the number of degrees of freedom of two and three coupled cavities . due to this",
    ", we have obtained the exact solution for the schrodinger equation in interaction picture . introducing the losses from the cavities , the master equation for undistinguished excitation of two and more cavities",
    "is studied in the sec.[sec:3 ] .",
    "in this section we apply the symmetrical propriety of undistinguished atoms and photons packed in coupled cavities . for comparison",
    "we consider the system of atoms situated at a distance less than the emission wavelength as in the dicke model @xcite . for simplicity",
    "we consider the system of two atoms .",
    "these distinguished atoms are characterized by four states : @xmath7 ; @xmath8 ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 . here",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are excited and ground states of @xmath13 atom , @xmath14 . considering that one of the atoms from the ensemble is in excited state we construct the collective excitation state @xmath15 which together with other two states @xmath16 and @xmath17 form three atomic collective states .",
    "it is important to emphasize , that the rotation of this ensemble at angle @xmath18 these collective states remain the same . for three atoms situated in vertexes of equidistant triangle , we can obtain four collective states @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 from @xmath23 distinguished @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 . as follows from this description of two collective states @xmath20 , and @xmath21",
    ", we observe that they can be regarded as a superposition of three distinguished states @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and are invariant under the angle rotations @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "let us return to the coupled ensemble of n doped cavities . in comparison with",
    "the above situation we have two localized excitations in each cavity .",
    "first of them is connected with atomic excitation and second with mode excitation in each cavity . in order to apply the proposed symmetry we introduce the hamiltonian of such coupled cavities in the interaction with the external electromagnetic field . indeed considering",

    "the coupling between the cavities is achieved by the second term of the interaction hamiltonian described by the exchange parameter @xmath49 .",
    "following the idea , that the system formed from @xmath36 cavities must remain in the same state after the application of rotation symmetry to regular polygon in the vertexes of which are situated the coupled cavities , we introduce the wave functions of the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h0 ] ) .",
