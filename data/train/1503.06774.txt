    "the galactic bulge holds important information towards understanding the formation and evolution of the milky way ( mw ) .",
    "however , our edge - on perspective in the disk plane and the large and variable dust extinction especially in optical bands make it a non - trivial task to study the mw bulge . despite these difficulties ,",
    "our knowledge of the galactic bulge has advanced greatly in the past two decades .",
    "numerous studies indicate that the mw bulge contains a bar structure .",
    "for example , the non - circular motions of gas in the inner galaxy was explained with bar perturbation ( de vaucouleurs 1964 ; fux 1999 ; englmaier & gerhard 1999 ; bissantz & gerhard 2002 ) .",
    "likewise , the boxy shape of the mw bulge revealed by _ cobe / dirbe _ photometry ( dwek et al .",
    "1995 ) was characterized as the perspective effect of a tilted bar ( blitz & spergel 1991 ; binney et al .",
    "more evidence for the barred morphology emerges from star counts using distance indicators like red clump ( rc ) stars ( stanek et al . 1994 ; rattenbury et al .",
    "2007 ; cao et al . 2013 ) .",
    "kinematic information of the mw bulge stellar populations provides additional insights into its origin . the bulge radial velocity assay ( brava ) revealed the fast cylindrical rotation of the galactic bulge extending up to @xmath2 , which is inconsistent with the classical scenario that the bulge is built in mergers and dominated by random motions ( howard et al .",
    "2008 , 2009 ; kunder et al .",
    "shen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) demonstrated that a pure - disk galaxy with a spontaneously formed bar structure can match the brava observation of the radial velocity and velocity dispersion towards the bulge region well .",
    "they also found that the mass of a classical bulge , if in existence , may be relatively small .",
    "therefore , the galactic bulge is likely built through bar - induced internal dynamical processes , with minor contribution from a merger - built classical bulge .",
    "recently , some studies suggested that the galactic bulge shows the signature of a vertical x - shape . towards the bulge region ,",
    "the apparent magnitudes of rcs in certain fields show double - peaked distributions , with increasing peak separations towards higher latitudes ( mcwilliam & zoccali 2010 ; nataf et al .",
    "2010 ; saito et al . 2011 ; ness et al . 2012 ; nataf et al .",
    "2015 ) . since rcs",
    "are well - calibrated standard candles with a roughly constant absolute magnitude , such a double - peaked feature seems to indicate the existence of a vertical x - shaped feature in the galactic bulge .",
    "more detailed studies revealed that certain latitudinal slices of the galactic bulge have two density lumps aligned with the bar , which indeed results in the observed double - peaked apparent magnitude distributions of rcs ( saito et al .",
    "based on the rcs in the vista variables in the via lactea ( vvv ) survey , the symmetrized three - dimensional bulge model of wegg & gerhard ( 2013 ) also clearly illustrates the x - shape in its side - on view and surface density slices .",
    "further made - to - measure modelling reveals an off - centered x - shape in the galactic bulge , and the peanut / x - shaped component accounts for over @xmath3 of the bulge stellar mass ( portail et al .",
    "the x - shaped bulge morphology is frequently seen in edge - on disk galaxies ( e.g. whitemore & bell 1988 ; ltticke et al .",
    "2000 ; bureau et al . 2006 ) , and is presumably similar to the structure in our own galaxy .    using a simple and self - consistent @xmath0-body simulation ,",
    "li & shen ( 2012 ) showed that such an x - shape can arise naturally during the evolution of the galactic bar .",
    "numerical simulations demonstrated that a bar forms via the bar instability , and then thickens vertically due to the buckling instability ( combes & sanders 1981 ; raha et al . 1991 ) .",
    "the vertical motion in a peanut / x - shape bulge is enhanced after the buckling episode .",
    "some studies proposed that x1 orbits with 2:1 vertical lindblad resonance , namely _ banana orbits _ for their side - on appearance , can contribute to the peanut / x - shaped feature in edge - on galaxies ( pfenniger & friedli 1991 ; patsis et al .",
    "2002 ; athanassoula 2005 ) .",
    "great efforts have been made to understand the roles of banana orbits ( and their associated orbits ) in forming the peanut / x - shaped bulges ( e.g. patsis & katsanikas 2014a , b ) .",
    "however , recent work by portail et al .",
    "( 2015b ) classified orbital families in the peanut / x - shaped bulges , and suggested the brezel - like orbit as the main contributor to the x - shape .",
    "since all of these orbital families can potentially support the peanut / x - shaped feature , additional kinematic information is required to distinguish their contributions in the galactic x - shape . if the galactic x - shape is dominated by certain orbital families , its stellar kinematics is expected to reflect the underlying orbital motion .",
    "thus , the stellar kinematics is essential to better understand the galactic x - shape .",

    "they interpreted the correlation with stars on elongated bar orbits , possibly the streaming motion along the arms of the x - shape .",
    "poleski et al .",
    "( 2013 ) ( hereafter p13 ) investigated the proper motion of rcs in fields at @xmath6 . between the probability - distinguished closer and further arms of the x - shape ,",

    "they attributed the linear side to the streaming motion within the x - shape . from a numerical perspective ,",
    "gardner et al . ( 2014 ) ( hereafter g14 ) first explored the kinematic properties of x - shaped bulges .",
    "they compared the kinematics at the closer and further sides of the bar / bulge , and suggested that x - shaped bugles show coherent signature of a minimum along @xmath1 in the mean radial velocity difference between the closer and further sides .",
    "although efforts have been made in both observations and simulations , the kinematics of the x - shape is still poorly understood .    in this paper",

    "we explore the kinematic features of the galactic x - shape , and compare our model to the observations and other simulation works .",
    "the numerical model here can not represent the actual galactic bulge in all aspects , but its self - consistency and simplicity still reveal the general properties of the x - shaped bulge in such exploration and comparison .",
    "our results lead to a better understanding of the existing observations , serve as an independent check of other numerical works , and make predictions for future observations . in section 2 , we briefly describe the @xmath0-body model used in this paper . results and comparisons with existing observations",
    "are shown in section 3 . in section 4 , we discuss the nature of the x - shape by analyzing the correlations between proper motions and radial velocities , and test two potential applications to derive galactic parameters based on the galactic x - shape .",
    "our results are summarized in section 5 .",
    "in this work , we use the same @xmath0-body model as in shen et al .",

    "initially it contains a cold ( toomre s @xmath11 ) exponential stellar disk of @xmath12 particles rotating in a rigid dark matter halo potential .",
    "the bar forms rapidly within the first gigayear , and becomes thickened vertically in the inner region via the buckling instability .",

    "assuming a distance of the sun to the galactic center ( gc ) ( @xmath16 ) and a @xmath17 angle of sun  gc line to the bar major axis , this model yields excellent matches with the mean radial velocity and velocity dispersion measurements of brava .",
    "the x - shape in this model was highlighted after subtracting a smooth component from the edge - on projection ( li & shen 2012 ) .",
    "the distance distributions in the model towards the bulge fields can qualitatively match the apparent magnitude distributions of rcs in mcwilliam & zoccali ( 2010 ) .",
    "thus , despite its simplicity , this model is valuable in understanding the kinematics of the galactic x - shape .    for consistency",
    ", we adopt the same solar configuration as in shen et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and li & shen ( 2012 ) .",
    "following g14 , we also split the particles in a field into two samples to illustrate the kinematic difference between the two sides of the bar / x - shape .",
    "particles within @xmath18 from the sun are denoted as `` near '' , and those beyond @xmath18 are denoted as `` far '' .",
    "we calculated the heliocentric radial velocity ( or line - of - sight velocity @xmath19 ) and proper motion ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) of particles inside the bar / bulge region ( galactocentric radii less than @xmath22 ) .",
    "along the minor axis of the galactic bulge , some specific fields are carefully studied in order to allow for detailed comparisons with observations . across the bulge region , particles are binned in the @xmath23 plane to map the spatial trend of the mean velocity and velocity dispersion . in observations ,",
    "@xmath24 from multi - epoch measurements needs a factor @xmath25 to represent its angular speed in the longitudinal direction , as required by the metric of spherical coordinates . in this paper",
    "we also use @xmath26 as the notation of the metric - corrected longitudinal proper motion .",
    "from the solar perspective , the galactic x - shape features double - peaked magnitude / distance distributions in fields passing through it ( li & shen 2012 ) . in this section , we study the distance distributions towards the x - shape in this model in greater detail , and investigate the properties of the double - peaked feature across the bulge region .",
    "we use kernel density estimator to test if the distance distribution is double - peaked ( silverman 1981 ; hall & york 2001 ) . in each field",

    "the multimodality of the distance distribution is illustrated with the critical kernel sizes for @xmath27 modes ( @xmath28 ) , and its significance levels are evaluated using bootstraping .",
    "a relatively large and statistically significant @xmath28 implies the existence of more than @xmath27 modes . for each field , we search for the critical kernel size for a single - peaked or double - peaked distribution ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively ) , and test their significance levels ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) via standard bootstrapping .",
    "the details of the method is described in appendix a.    to illustrate the properties of the double - peaked feature , we locate the two peaks in the distance distribution using the mean value of @xmath29 and @xmath30 as an optimal kernel size , and find the separation of the two peaks in the distance distribution and the ratio of peak amplitudes ( far to near ) .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the algorithm here is relatively conservative , while the visual identification ( with _ a priori _ knowledge about the double peaks ) is more flexible in distinguishing modes .",
    "+      figure [ fig : double_peak_map ] shows the properties of the double - peaked distance distributions across the bulge region . inside the regions where the double - peaked feature is robustly detected , we find some prominent trends .",
    "the separation of the two peaks in the distance distribution increases with @xmath33 due to the x - shape geometry ( upper left panel ) , which is especially clear in the vertical slice of @xmath1 ( upper right panel ) .",
    "while at the same latitude , the separation is roughly constant .",
    "meanwhile , the ratio of peak amplitude ( far to near ) decreases with @xmath7 .",
    "since the bar is tilted , its near and far sides dominate at @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively , as illustrated in the latitudinal slice of @xmath36 ( lower right panel ) .",
    "as @xmath7 decreases , the peak amplitude decreases at the near side but increases at the far side , which further increases the ratio of peak amplitude ( far to near ) .",
    "in addition , at both sides , the identified peaks are closer to the observer as @xmath7 increases ( lower right panel ) . in other regions where",
    "the double - peaked feature is not robustly detected ( low @xmath31 ) , the separation and peak ratio are spiky since the secondary peaks are likely to be spurs in the under - smoothed distribution there .",

    "the peak separation measured in @xmath37 ( @xmath38 above the disk plane at the gc ) is about @xmath39 , which is similar to the result in figure 8 of mcwilliam & zoccali ( 2010 ) . the varying peak amplitude due to the tilted bar / x - shape agrees with the results in mcwilliam & zoccali ( 2010 ) and saito et al .",

    "the longitudinal range for the double - peaked feature in our model becomes much wider than @xmath46 in saito et al .",
    "these minor disagreements could be due to the different peak - finding methods adopted .    to further illustrate the statistical significance of the double - peaked feature in the distance distribution ,",
    "the critical kernel sizes ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 ) and their significance levels ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 ) are illustrated in figure [ fig : silverman_test ] .",
    "closer to the disk plane , most regions towards the galactic bulge feature low @xmath31 , @xmath32 and relatively small @xmath29 , @xmath30 , suggesting that the distance distributions are single - peaked there . in two triangular regions",
    "away from the disk plane ( @xmath47 ) , we obtain clearly larger @xmath29 with high significance level , while both @xmath30 and @xmath32 are modest there .",
    "the robustly large @xmath29 but insignificant @xmath30 here indicates that in these regions , the distance distribution is strongly double - peaked due to the presence of the vertical x - shape .",
    "furthermore , the critical kernel size @xmath29 increases with @xmath33 , which also agrees with the larger peak separation at higher latitudes .",
    "since larger kernel sizes are required to over - smooth the gap between the two modes towards higher latitudes , the increasing @xmath29 with @xmath33 also implies the vertical x - shape .    in practice",

    "in contrast , inside the plaut s window ( @xmath51 ) , the radial velocity barely differs between the bright and faint rcs ( de propris et al .",
    "the numerical study of g14 related the x - shape morphology to a minimum in the mean difference @xmath19 between the two sides .",
    "therefore , although there have been a handful of kinematic studies of the bulge stars focused in exploring the x - shape , the kinematic imprints of the x - shape are still not well studied .",

    ", we set the circular velocity of the sun to be @xmath52 , without considering the solar motion with respect to the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .",
    "since the model is symmetric with respect to the galactic plane , two fields with opposite latitudes are combined in the analysis to achieve better number statistics .",
    "figure [ fig : v_los ] shows the radial velocity distributions in @xmath1 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . for both sides of the bar / x - shape , the radial velocity spans a wider range at latitudes closer to the galactic plane , which is seen in the decreasing velocity dispersion with @xmath33 . in the same field , we find systematically smaller velocity dispersion at the far side , indicating a decreasing velocity dispersion away from the galactic disk . in all these fields , the near side has more approaching particles ( negative @xmath19 ) , while the far side has more receding particles ( positive @xmath19 ) accordingly .",
    "the excess of approaching / receding particles is evident in the median velocities of the two sides .",

    "although the reported excesses at @xmath57 in v13 are not clear in this model alone , there are clear excesses at @xmath58 , which , however , become less noticeable in the combined field @xmath59 .",
    "perhaps we need better number statistics to confirm this , both in observations and models .",
    "] , there are indeed more approaching or receding particles at the two sides , which agrees well with figure [ fig : bar_orbit ] .",
    "nidever et al . (",
    "2012 ) also used bar orbits to explain the cold high - velocity peaks seen in the commissioning observations of the apache point observatory galactic evolution experiment ( apogee ) .",
    "however , as li et al .",

    "then we study the mean radial velocity ( @xmath61 ) , and its dispersion ( @xmath62 ) across the whole bulge region .",
    "as illustrated in figure [ fig : vlos_map ] , @xmath61 at both sides shows clear cylindrical rotation , and the longitudinal gradient of @xmath61 is strong at @xmath44 , which coincides with the latitude where the x - shape is detectable in this model .",
    "the zero - velocity line of @xmath61 shifts towards @xmath34 at the near side , and towards @xmath35 at the far side .",
    "the shift of zero - velocity lines agrees with the coherent alignment of elongated orbits .",
    "as sketched in figure [ fig : bar_orbit ] , the radial velocity is zero only close to the two tips of such orbits .",
    "if the bar structure is populated by such orbits , the zero - velocity lines at the two sides of the bar will appear at two opposite sides of @xmath1 . also , the decreasing radial velocity dispersion away from the gc indicates a kinematically hot inner bulge .",
    "we find that , the difference of @xmath61 between the near and far sides ( near - far ) is generally negative , while the difference of @xmath62 is mostly positive . since on the @xmath23 plane , the particles at the near side are closer to the disk plane than those at the far side , the positive @xmath63 and negative @xmath64 may reflect the kinematic gradient in the vertical direction .",
    "near @xmath65 , we also notice the minimum of @xmath64 along @xmath1 . considering both the absolute value and the relative depth with respect to the gc , the minimum in our model is quite similar to g14 .",
    "the agreement between our model and g14 indicates that the minimum in the mean difference of radial velocity may be a coherent feature of x - shaped bulges , which may originate from the excess of approaching / receding particles at the near and far sides .",

    "the galactocentric radius and the height of the peak particles ( the blue dots ) increase with @xmath33 , resulting in larger @xmath91 at smaller radius and smaller @xmath91 at larger distance compared to the average value ( the black line ) . ]        to better understand this behavior , we compare the mean azimuthal velocity of peak particles with the azimuthally averaged rotational velocity of all the particles at the same galactocentric radius , regardless of their height @xmath90 . we study a series of fields within @xmath93 ( with an interval of @xmath94 ) along @xmath1 . for each field ,",
    "the average rotation velocity ( @xmath91 ) and the corresponding angular velocity ( @xmath95 ) is different from the conventional angular frequency derived from the circular - speed curve . ] are computed based on peak particles .",
    "an average radius ( @xmath96 ) for each pair is obtained by averaging the galactocentric radius of the two peaks .",
    "of course , this radius increases for higher galactic latitudes .",
    "therefore , @xmath82 from equation 3 at different galactic latitudes can be naturally translated into a function of radius .",
    "figure 14 shows @xmath91 and @xmath97 as a function of the galactocentric radius @xmath96 .",
    "the solid line represents the azimuthally averaged @xmath91 .",
    "apparently , @xmath91 and @xmath97 of peak particles ( blue dots ) agree very well with the azimuthally averaged values of all the particles ( black solid line ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath82 in equation 3 actually measures the azimuthal streaming motions ( @xmath91 ) , rather than the bar pattern speed .",
    "since the x - shape is symmetric in the @xmath55 plane , it can be used to locate the position of the gc ( mcwilliam & zoccali 2010 ; g14 ) .",
    "the gc can be located by fitting the peak positions in the vertical @xmath1 plane with the x - shape geometry .",
    "g14 compared two ways to locate the gc position , namely fitting the four arms of the x - shape , versus fitting the x - shape with two crossed lines .",
    "they found that method ii yields an accuracy better than @xmath83 in most cases , even if the peak distance has an uncertainty of @xmath3 .",
    "however , the sample limitations ( e.g. latitude coverage , number of fields , etc . ) may affect the results .",
    "we try to locate the gc in our model with these two methods , and further beyond g14 , we test their accuracies under different latitude coverages and total number of fields .",
    "we select @xmath0 pairs of fields along the minor axis of the bulge ( @xmath1 ) , with @xmath0 fields above and @xmath0 fields below the galactic plane respectively .",
    "fields are randomly selected in the latitude range where the x - shape can be clearly identified in this model ( @xmath98 ) . in each field , the two peaks are identified with the same procedure described in section 2.1 .",
    "we then fit the arms of the x - shape with four straight lines , and find their intersection points ( method i ) . in the ideal case , two of their four intersection points are right above / below the gc ( i.e. on the vertical axis of the galaxy ) , and the other two points are exactly on the galactic plane . thus the gc position can be located from the galactic vertical axis , and the galactic plane .",
    "meanwhile , we try to locate the gc by directly fitting the x - shape with two crossed lines ( method ii ) .",
    "the two methods are illustrated in the left panel of figure [ fig : gcfit ] .",
    "we run a series of tests with different @xmath0 to demonstrate the effect of limited field number .",
    "to illustrate the impact of limited latitude coverage , in another series of tests , we also change the latitude range to @xmath99 ( `` lower '' ) or @xmath100 ( `` higher '' ) , and compare the results with the case of full latitude coverage ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "we find that , fitting the x - shape with two crossed lines ( method ii , right panel of figure [ fig : gcfit ] ) yields better results compared to fitting the four individual arms ( method i , middle of figure [ fig : gcfit ] ) , which agrees with the conclusion in g14 .",
    "meanwhile , increasing the number of fields leads to smaller uncertainties for both methods .",
    "we also find that , the accuracy of fitting depends on the latitude range of the fields used .",
    "the position of the gc can be better constrained with the fields at lower latitudes , while the fields at higher latitudes give the worst results . in principle , fields at higher latitudes put stronger constraints on the gc position . however , since the x - shape is well - defined at lower latitudes ( @xmath102 ) due to better number statistics ( also seen in the upper right panel of figure 1 ) , the fitting results from these regions are more accurate compared to higher latitudes ( @xmath103 ) .    fitting the x - shaped overdensity is a novel and accurate way to determine the position of the galactic center .",
    "however , it still has some drawbacks .",
    "first it relies on the identification of peaks in the apparent magnitude distributions of the sample , which could have large uncertainties in real observations due to the presence of scatters in the intrinsic luminosity , source incompleteness and sample contamination , etc . in the conversion from magnitude to distance ,",
    "reddening and extinction could also contribute to the uncertainties .",
    "even if the uncertainties due to photometric distance determination can be greatly reduced with geometric distance measurements like _ gaia _ does , there remains uncertainties in method ii .",
    "ideally , if the peaks at the near side have similar heights as the far side , fitting two diagonal lines should trace the exact position of gc .",
    "however , due to the projection effect , the peaks identified at the near side are closer to the disk plane than the far side .",
    "consequently , the intersection of the two best - fit crossed lines tends to be closer to the sun , leading to a slight systematic underestimation of the gc distance .",
    "since the projection effect is stronger at higher latitude , fields at lower latitudes are expected to yield better results than those at higher latitudes , which agrees with the right panel of figure [ fig : gcfit ] . in reality , the number of observational fields are usually not symmetric above and below the galactic plane , which may also affect the best - fit crossed lines to locate the gc .",
    "we explore the kinematic properties of the x - shaped milky way bulge with an @xmath0-body model that well represents the observed morphology and dynamics of the galactic bulge . from the solar perspective",
    ", the two density peaks on the sightlines due to the x - shape are identified using a gaussian kernel density estimator with adaptive kernel size . in this model ,",
    "the distance distributions appear to be double - peaked above @xmath44 along @xmath1 , and the increasing separation between two peaks with @xmath33 agrees with previous observations . as a result of a tilted bar , the height ratio of the two peaks ( far to near ) , as well as their mean distance to the sun , features a longitudinal gradient at higher latitudes .",
    "we study the line - of - sight velocity and proper motion distributions in fields ( @xmath67 and @xmath68 ) along @xmath1 , with the opposite fields properly scaled and added to increase number statistics . to illustrate the possible imprints of the bar / x - shape ,",
    "the particles are divided into two groups ( near and far ) according to their distances to the sun compared to @xmath18 . in these fields ,",
    "the line - of - sight velocity distributions significantly differ between the near and far sides ; the near side shows an excess of approaching particles , while a corresponding excess of receding particles exists in the far side .",
    "due to the rotation of the bar / bulge , the longitudinal proper motions at the near and far sides peak at the positive and negative sides of @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "the measured mean differences of @xmath20 between the two sides are comparable to the proper motion dispersion there , indicating the fast cylindrical rotation of the bar / bulge .",
    "the latitudinal proper motions at the two sides barely differ in their mean values .",
    "we note that the differences of @xmath19 and @xmath20 between the two sides can be qualitatively explained with the coherent alignment of bar - supporting orbits .",
    "we test if the larger proper motion dispersion measured at the near side ( compared to the far side ) is due to the closer distance . in our model ,",
    "only the dispersion ratio of @xmath20 between the two sides ( near to far ) is marginally consistent with the distance ratio of the two peaks ( far to near ) .",
    "the results here indicate that the systematically larger dispersion at the near side is not only due to the closer distance , but also contributed by the differences in their intrinsic velocity distributions .",
    "we also map the mean line - of - sight velocity , mean proper motion and their corresponding dispersions across the bulge region , both with and without distinguishing the near and far sides of the galactic bar / bulge .",
    "the mean @xmath19 at the two sides features strong cylindrical rotation , and the position of the zero - velocity line with respect to @xmath1 agrees with the coherent alignment or bar - supporting orbits .",
    "the mean difference of @xmath19 between the near and far sides shows a shallow minimum along @xmath1 , which is suggested as the signature of an x - shaped bulge ( g14 ) . without distinguishing the near and far sides",
    ", @xmath61 is symmetric with respect to @xmath1 , which barely shows the effect of the tilted bar as reported in zoccali et al .",
    "for the mean @xmath20 at the two sides , due to the coherent alignment of bar - supporting orbits , the extrema shift to the two opposite sides of @xmath1 respectively . at lower latitudes ,",
    "the displacements of the extrema are larger than that at higher latitudes",
    ". this may be due to the buckled inner region of the bar dominating at higher latitudes , while the long and thin component of the bar dominates at lower latitudes .",
    "inside @xmath104 , @xmath105 , the mean differences of @xmath20 and @xmath21 between the two sides are roughly symmetric with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "the breaks of @xmath74 and @xmath106 reported in p13 are absent in our model .    for their dispersions , @xmath62 , @xmath78 and @xmath107 at both near and far sides",
    "reveal the kinematically hot central region .",
    "the dispersion ratio is saddle - shaped at both sides , with a diagonal pattern of the cross - correlation factor , indicating that the proper motion anisotropy is tilted towards the gc . without distinguishing the near and far sides of the bar / x - shape , the dispersion of @xmath19 shows a vertically elongated peak similar to zoccali et al .",
    "meanwhile , the proper motion dispersion is larger in the longitudinal direction , and the dispersion ratio ( @xmath108 ) increases away from @xmath1 . we also observe a diagonal pattern of the cross - correlation factor .",
    "compared to the proper motion measurements in rattenbury et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , this model shows slightly smaller dispersion but stronger anisotropy .",
    "we also study the orbital motion inside the x - shape using the correlation of velocity components . in @xmath109 , for @xmath21 vs. @xmath19 and @xmath21 vs. @xmath20 , both the significance of the correlations ( pearson s r value ) and the slope from linear regressions reveal slightly stronger velocity anisotropy near the x - shape . except for @xmath21 vs. @xmath20 at the near side , the correlation is weakest for the peak sample .",
    "we note that at both sides , the direction of the anisotropy roughly coincides with the case of downward - tilt banana orbits ( for @xmath110 ) .",
    "however , the underlying orbital family can not be clearly distinguished here .    with this model ,",
    "we extend the azimuthal rotation velocity measured in p13 with the x - shape kinematics to various galactic latitudes .",
    "we find that the angular velocity decreases at higher galactic latitudes , inconsistent with being the bar pattern speed .",
    "the angular velocity derived from the proper motion difference between the two sides of the x - shape actually measures the azimuthal streaming motions , similar to the mean rotation profile @xmath111 .    the x - shape is thought to be able to constrain the position of the galactic center due to its symmetry .",
    "we test two methods to do this proposed in gardner et al .",
    "( 2014 ) with our model , namely fitting the four arms of the x - shape to find the center and diagonally joining the four arms by fitting the x - shape with two crossed lines .",
    "we demonstrate that a global - fitting yields better results than fitting the four arms individually . also , the fields at lower latitudes provide stronger constraints on the gc position due to better number statistics there .",

    "in this section , we present a brief description of the silverman s test used in section 3.1 .",
    "the silverman s test ( silverman 1981 ) is based on the kernel density estimation of the sample . for a univariate sample @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 drawn from an unknown probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath115 , its kernel density estimator ( kde ) is @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the random variable , @xmath118 is the kernel function which is assumed to be a gaussian distribution function , and @xmath119 is the kernel size .",
    "here @xmath120 serves as an approximation of the unknown original pdf @xmath115 .",
    "it resembles a continuous version of the histogram , and @xmath119 corresponds to the `` bin size '' .",
    "the kernel size @xmath119 controls the amount of smoothing ; larger @xmath119 leads to fewer peaks in the kde with the gaussian kernel .    to test the null hypothesis that @xmath115 has @xmath27 or fewer modes ( @xmath121 ) against the alternative one that @xmath115 has more than @xmath27 modes ( @xmath122 ) , we use the critical kernel size of @xmath27 modes @xmath123 large",
    "@xmath28 rejects the null hypothesis , indicating that there are more than @xmath27 peaks . in other words",
    ", the @xmath27-critical kernel size is the smallest kernel size that makes a kde of @xmath27 peaks , for a particular sample .",
    "if the sample has more than @xmath27 modes , a large @xmath28 is required to over - smooth the kde , and reduce the peak number to @xmath27 . on the contrary , if the sample itself has less than @xmath27 modes , only an under - smoothed kde can result in more than @xmath27 peaks , which requires a small @xmath27-critical kernel size .    for a particular @xmath27-mode hypothesis ,",
    "now we address the statistical significance of the @xmath27-critical kernel size from the data ( @xmath124 ) . in principle , one can draw a series of samples with equal size @xmath125 from @xmath115 , find their @xmath27-critical kernel sizes ( @xmath126 ) , and compare the critical kernel size from the data to those from resampling the true pdf @xmath115 using the @xmath127 level test : @xmath128 where @xmath129 represents the conditional probability , and @xmath127 is the level of significance . since the peak number decreases with increasing the kernel size , we can address the significance level of @xmath124 by accounting for the peak number of @xmath130 from resampling : @xmath131 @xmath132    however , the true density @xmath115 is always unknown . in order to evaluate the significance of @xmath124 , silverman ( 1981 ) generated the samples using the method in efron ( 1979 ) : @xmath133 where @xmath134 are sampled uniformly from the original data allowing replacement , @xmath135 is the variance of the sample , @xmath124 is the @xmath27-critical kernel size from the data , and @xmath136 is a series of random numbers from a standard normal distribution . here",
    "@xmath137 actually samples a representative pdf @xmath138 , which is at most @xmath27-modal , and has the same variance as the sample .",
    "therefore , the significance level of @xmath124 can be conservatively estimated with such a bootstraping procedure .",
    "besides its conservative nature , the silverman s test is also not asymptotically accurate .",
    "one way to improve the accuracy of silverman s multimodality test is presented in hall & york ( 2011 ) , by using a bootstraping distribution function @xmath139 as suggested in hall & york ( 2011 ) , there exists a unique absolute constant @xmath140 such that the bootstrap test is asymptotically correct : @xmath141 @xmath142 and the constant @xmath140 can be calculated either analytically , or using monte carlo simulations . in addressing the significance level of the double - peaked feature ( @xmath143 ) , we use the tabular value given in hall & york ( 2011 ) ."
