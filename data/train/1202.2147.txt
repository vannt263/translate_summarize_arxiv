    "it is an important task in quantum information processing when a quantum state is transferred from one location to another .",
    "it refers to not only quantum communication @xcite , but also large - scale quantum computing @xcite .",
    "different protocols are proposed to realize quantum state transfer ( qst ) .",
    "for example , based on measurement and reconstruction , an unknown quantum state can be faithfully transferred to an arbitrarily distant location via quantum teleportation @xcite . during the quantum teleportation , the measured result instead of the quantum state",
    "is transferred by a classical communication channel .",
    "alternatively , a quantum state can be sent through a channel directly .",
    "there are two types of such state transfer which depends on the transfer distance . for long distance communication ,",
    "the information encoded in photons can be transferred by an optical fiber @xcite , which has been widely used in quantum communication and cryptography applications @xcite .",
    "compared with the long distance communication , a kind of short distance communication which can be used between adjacent quantum processors was recently introduced @xcite . using an unmodulated spin chain as a channel",
    ", the state transmits from one end of the chain to another with some fidelity .",
    "subsequently , many schemes are proposed to gain higher even perfect transfer fidelity @xcite .    on account of the possibility of individual addressing ,",
    "an array of coupled cavities is probably a promising candidate for simulating spin chains .",
    "the coupled cavities can be realized in various physical systems @xcite , such as photonic crystals @xcite , superconducting resonators @xcite , and cavity - fiber - cavity system @xcite .",
    "so far , the heisenberg chains of spin @xmath0 @xcite , of any high spin @xcite , and with next - nearest - neighbor interactions @xcite are simulated in the coupled cavities . in these simulation processes ,",
    "the cavity field is ingeniously removed , and the same procedure occurs when the qst is investigated in ref .",
    "however , the array of coupled cavities , a hybrid system combining the spinor atom and photons , would provide richer phenomena than the pure spin chains or bose - hubbard model hartmann2006,greentre2006,mak2008 .",
    "for this reason , the temporal dynamics @xcite and the binary transmission @xcite , i.e. , the qst including both components in one - dimensional ( 1d ) coupled cavities , are analyzed in detail .",
    "the binary transmission mentioned above is restricted in single - excitation subspace , i.e. , only one photon transfers along the cavities in cascades , and usually the transfer distant extensively depends on the lifetime of atomic excitation state .",
    "quite recently , the two - photon propagation in waveguide has been attracting increasing interest from many researchers , such as two - photon transport in 1d waveguide coupled to a two - level emitter @xcite , a three - level emitter @xcite , and a nonlinear cavity law .",
    "compared with one - photon electric - dipole e1 transition , the two - photon 2e1 transition that emits two photons simultaneously is a second - order transition @xcite .",
    "therefore , the metastable state decaying via 2e1 transition has remarkable longer lifetime than the excited state decaying via e1 transition .",
    "the typical example is the lifetime for the @xmath1 state in hydrogen is of the order of fractions of a second , which is several orders longer than that of single - photon excitation state .",
    "the long lifetime of the metastable state could provide sufficient operation time to transfer information .",
    "more recently , law _",
    "_ reveal that the photons trend to bound together @xcite in the two - excitation subspace when the ratio of vacuum rabi frequency to the tunneling rate between cavities exceeds a critical value .",
    "motivated by these aspects , it is desired to explore the short distance binary transmission of the model that bounding two photons as a quasiparticle @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we investigate the binary transmission in 1d array of coupled cavities , each of which contains a three - level atom . by adiabatically eliminating the intermediate state , the individual cavity can be described by the two - photon jaynes - cummings ( jc ) model with a metastable state and a ground state . in the single - atom excitation subspace ,",
    "the system hamiltonian is able to be diagonalized exactly .",
    "it allows us to focus on the binary transmission with the explicit expression of the excitation population .",
    "we consider the uniform and staggered intercavity hopping in different parameters regimes , especially in the strong coupling and strong hopping limits . with the uniform hopping , we find that the initial state of polariton located in the first cavity is essential to the transmission fidelity",
    ". when the polariton is a pure atomic state , an oscillation behavior in the envelopment of fidelity occurs and the state transfer probability increases obviously . on resonance , we reveal the optimal transmission time is mainly governed by the intercavity hopping strength and the system size .",
    "we also show that the exploiting of the metastable state overcomes the deficit of short transfer distance during the lifetime of excitation state @xcite . with the staggered hopping ,",
    "the excitation population trends to be localized in the first several cavities and slows down the transfer speed .",
    "this phenomenon becomes more distinct as the distortion of the hopping strength enlarges .",
    "in the free evolution of the system , the transmission fidelity drops quickly as the size of the array increases . how to enhance the fidelity of the transmission is important , since the fidelity of qst is expected to be better than that by using straightforward classical communication .",
    "we finally demonstrate that a class of initial encoding and final decoding process , which is currently used in spin chains zou , bish , can also greatly improve the performance of binary transmission .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the dynamics of an array of coupled cavities with the uniform coupling . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider the general situation with staggered coupling between the adjacent cavities .",
    "section iv gives an effective method to improve the fidelity of the quantum state transfer by encoding and decoding limited qubits in strong coupling regime . in sec .",
    "v , we give a brief conclusion to the paper .",
    "we consider an array of coupled cavities , each of which contains a three - level atom in cascade configuration .",
    "the individual cavity is tuned to two - photon resonance with the metastable state @xmath2 and the ground state @xmath3 , and these two states are coupled to an intermediate state @xmath4 with a single mode of the electromagnetic field with coupling strengths @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively .",

    "the metastable state @xmath2 and the ground state @xmath18 is coupled by a two - photon process with strength @xmath19 , which is given as @xmath20 .",
    "the two - photon jc model has been experimentally realized in high - q superconducting microwave cavity @xcite .    in hamiltonian ( [ singlecavity ] )",
    ", the operator @xmath21 @xmath22 commutes with @xmath23 , implying that the total number of atomic inversion and photonic excitation is conserved .",
    "the two - photon jc hamiltonian can be diagonalized analytically . spanned by the subspace @xmath24 ( @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 ) , where @xmath25 is the number of photons , the hamiltonian can be written by the polaritonic state as @xmath28    the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of @xmath29 can be written in terms of the dressed - state representation@xmath30where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and the detuning @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath36 cavities linked via two - photon exchange are described by the hamiltonian @xmath37where @xmath38 is the intercavity coupling of double photons and @xmath39 is the adjacency matrix of the connectivity graph . here",
    "the photons only hop between the nearest - neighbor cavities , so the matrix element is given by @xmath40 .",
    "since the hopping between cavities does not change the number of photons , the operator @xmath41 commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath42 . for simplicity , the analysis is restricted to the case of @xmath43 , i.e. , the system contains only single - atom excitation or two - photon excitation .",
    "here it is assumed that all the cavities are equal .",
    "then we extract the site indexes from the atomic and field operators , and define them as a set of bare bases which form a complete hilbert space .",

    "if the open chain of the coupled cavity is considered , i.e. , the hard - wall boundary conditions are assumed , the eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix @xmath39 are @xcite @xmath53 , with corresponding eigenvalues @xmath54 for all @xmath55 . for a 1d chain of cavities",

    "the upper two plots show the population of atom ( a ) and photon ( b ) in the strong j - c coupling regime ( @xmath62 ) , and the lower two plots are the population of atom ( c ) and photon ( d ) in the strong hopping regime ( @xmath63 ) .",

    "the time evolution of arbitrary @xmath36 cavities can be straightforwardly derived . in the following ,",
    "the quantum state transfer is studied in such model .",
    "it should be emphasized that there exist two channels , either atomic or photonic , to transfer information , which is different from state transfer in a pure spin chain . in this model ,",
    "the sender and receiver can select which qubit is encoded and decoded .",
    "the ground state of the system @xmath67 with a zero eigenenergy will not involve any evolution by the hamiltonian @xmath68 .",

    "such hamiltonian mimics two heisenberg spin chains @xcite in atomic and photonic channels respectively .",
    "then the information transferred from sender to receiver can be encoded in either channel with speed @xmath38 , and the selectivity of channels may be useful in binary communication . compared with the ref .",
    "mak , due to the bounding effect of photon discussed here , the time for the quantum state transfer is reduced by half given the both system have the same hopping strength ( see fig .",

    "[ coh ] ( c ) and ( d ) show that the evolution of system has a similar behavior as that of @xmath84 .",
