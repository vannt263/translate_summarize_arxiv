    "given a direction by time , ancestry relationships between species , individuals , alleles or cells can be modeled as trees . assuming the yule model ( forward in time ) @xcite or the kingman coalescent ( backward in time ) @xcite , trees are rooted , binary , un - ordered and ranked . both processes generate identical distributions of tree topologies ( cladograms ) @xcite and their combinatorial properties have attracted attention since long ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "an important statistic , which has been investigated in several studies , is the number of subtrees of given size @xcite .",
    "the first results in this series concerned subtrees with two leaves , called _ cherries _ @xcite .    a different , but also purely topological , tree - parameter is imbalance , measured , for instance , by _ colless_ index or _",
    "sackin _ s index @xcite .",
    "these measures are summary statistics of the degree of imbalance averaged across all internal tree nodes .",
    "imbalance of evolutionary trees has found several applications : as a measure of speciation dynamics and species relationships @xcite , as a characteristic of the phylodynamics in virus strains @xcite and as an ingredient of tests of the neutral evolution hypothesis @xcite .",
    "the goal of this work is to introduce and to investigate a family of trees which is characterized by a condition of imbalance valid for all internal nodes .",
    "the motivation for this is twofold . from a biological point of view",
    ", imbalance of genealogies has been identified as a feature of populations which evolve under strong selective pressure .",
    "for instance , the genealogies of influenza viruses or the intra - host genealogies of hiv show a strikingly unbalanced branching pattern @xcite . from a mathematical point of view",
    ", the class of trees considered here naturally extends the one of so - called _ caterpillar _ genealogies @xcite . due to their simple structure",
    ", the restriction of a general tree problem to caterpillar - like trees often provides a solution to combinatorial problems which is not available in a more general context ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is then of interest to generalize the notion of caterpillar shape to comprehend a larger , but still topologically simple , variety of trees .",
    "to do so , we consider the following constraint . given a tree @xmath4 generated by the yule process , we call the _ size _ of @xmath4 the number of its _ internal _ nodes",
    ". further , we denote by @xmath5 the size of the smaller of the left and right subtrees originating at node @xmath6 .",
    "given now an integer @xmath7 , we say that @xmath4 is an @xmath8-tree ( or simply an @xmath0-tree ) if @xmath9 for all internal nodes @xmath6 .",
    "@xmath0-trees form a subset of un - restricted trees .",
    "for any pair of integers @xmath3 , @xmath10 with @xmath11 , we have @xmath12 , where strict inclusion holds if @xmath13 .",
    "otherwise , the set is maximal , i.e. all trees of size @xmath14 are actually @xmath15-trees with @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath3-constraint bounds the complexity of tree - shape .",
    "this is of help , for instance , when studying the structure of so - called _ induced subtrees _ , which appear naturally in sub - sampling or boot - strapping problems .",
    "induced subtrees are generated by extracting only those branches of an existing tree which connect a subset of leaves to their most recent common ancestor .    obviously , for small @xmath3 , it is very unlikely that an @xmath0-tree is generated by chance under the yule process . despite of this",
    ", they can represent the entire un - constrained tree space .",
    "for instance , focusing on cherries , we show that the moments of the number of cherries in @xmath0-trees converge fast to those in unconstrained trees .",
    "the number of subtrees with two leaves is then invariant under the @xmath3-constraint .",
    "our approach , which makes extensive use of generating function techniques , can be extended to higher level subtree - statistics",
    ". it will be interesting to investigate in the future other topological properties which are invariant under strong node imbalance .",
    "we start with some basic definitions .",
    "a _ binary rooted _ tree is a tree with a root and in which all nodes have outdegree either @xmath17 or @xmath18 .",
    "nodes with outdegree @xmath18 are called _ internal _ , nodes with outdegree @xmath17 are _",
    "external_. external nodes are also called _ leaves_. we consider the size @xmath14 of a tree to be the number of its internal nodes .",
    "the _ subtree _ of an internal node @xmath6 is the tree with root @xmath6 .",
    "a tree is said to be _ un - ordered _ ( in graph theoretical sense ) if subtrees stemming from an internal node have not a left - right order . disregarding branch lengths",
    ", we consider the following class . a binary un - ordered tree of size @xmath14",
    "is said to be a _ ranked tree _",
    "if the set of internal nodes is totally ordered by labels @xmath19 in such a way each child - node label is greater than the parent - node label ( see fig .  [ ranked5 ] ) .",
    "the total order of internal labels can be interpreted as a historical time order . to emphasize this @xcite called such trees _",
    "the set of ranked trees of size @xmath14 is denoted by @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "furthermore , given a tree @xmath4 , we denote by @xmath22 the number of internal nodes whose children are two leaves .",
    "such internal nodes are called _ cherries _ of the tree . @xcite",
    "have shown that the random variable @xmath23 , i.e. number of cherries , is asymptotically normal for large @xmath14 with expectation @xmath24 and variance @xmath25 .",
    "fig.[cher ] shows , for several values of @xmath14 , the distribution of @xmath23 for ranked trees of size  @xmath14 .    *",
    "the @xmath3-constraint . *",
    "let us now introduce @xmath0-trees as a subclass of @xmath26 .",
    "fix @xmath27 and , given a tree @xmath28 , we say that @xmath4 is a @xmath0-tree if _ each _ node @xmath6 of @xmath4 satisfies @xmath29 where @xmath30 ( resp .",
    "@xmath31 ) is the _ left _",
    "_ right _ ) subtree of @xmath6 . for fixed @xmath3 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath32 the set of @xmath0-trees of size @xmath14 .",
    "observe that @xmath33 for every @xmath14 .",
    "if @xmath3 is small , the constraint has a strong effect on the topology of the resulting trees .",
    "a @xmath0-tree looks as in fig .",
    "it has an extended back - bone to which `` small '' trees of size at _ most _ @xmath3 are appended . the length of this path , i.e.",
    ", the number of nodes it contains , is bounded ( from below ) by @xmath34 . for @xmath3 small",
    ", it provides a measure of the _ depth _ of the tree , where the latter is the number of archs in the _ longest _ path which connects the root to a leaf . in",
    "an un - constrained ranked tree the minimum depth is @xmath35 .",
    "average depth is depicted in fig .",
    "[ anna ] and was obtained by simulations of @xmath36 ranked trees @xcite each for @xmath37 .",
    "note , for @xmath14 sufficiently large , average depth of un - constrained trees is smaller than the lower bound for @xmath0-trees .",
    "the effect of the @xmath3-constraint becomes manifest also in the number of different subtrees .",
    "indeed , for each @xmath38 , a @xmath0-tree contains at _ most _ one subtree of size @xmath39 . the tree shown in fig .",
    "[ ome ] has size @xmath40 and belongs to @xmath41 .",
    "it does not contain any subtree of size @xmath42 and just one of size @xmath43 .",
    "in this section we count the number of the possible @xmath0-trees of size @xmath14 . in other words ,",
    "we determine the cardinality of @xmath32 . furthermore , recalling that under the yule model the probability of a ranked tree @xmath4 of size @xmath14 with @xmath44 cherries is given by tajima s weight @xcite @xmath45 we also need to consider the number of cherries in our enumerations .",
    "let @xmath46 be the sequence of _ euler _ numbers .",
    "they enumerates un - constrained trees @xcite , i.e. , @xmath47 .",
    "the first terms of the sequence are @xmath48 which means , for example , that there are exactly @xmath49 different ranked trees of size @xmath50 .",
    "let us fix @xmath3 and note that if @xmath51 with @xmath52 , then @xmath4 is built appending to a common root a @xmath0-tree @xmath53 with @xmath54 and a ranked tree @xmath55 with @xmath56 . finally we need to merge the order of the nodes of @xmath53 with the one for the nodes of @xmath55 .",
    "this can be done in exactly @xmath57 ways since there are no symmetries between @xmath53 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus , considering that for the first @xmath58 values we have @xmath59 we can define , for @xmath60 , the following recursion      in order to consider also the number of cherries , we need to refine the previous formula .",
    "let @xmath62 be the number of trees in @xmath20 having exactly @xmath44 cherries .",
    "similarly @xmath63 is the class of @xmath3-trees of size @xmath14 with @xmath44 cherries .",
    "the recursion above becomes then @xmath64 if @xmath65 while , when @xmath60 , we have to consider latexmath:[\\[\\label{mucca }"
