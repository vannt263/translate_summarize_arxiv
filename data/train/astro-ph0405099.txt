    "during the last century , masses of supermassive black holes and stellar mass black holes are observationally measured .",
    "determination of a spin parameter of a black hole is one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics in this century .",
    "so far , several determination methods of a black hole spin are proposed .",
    "broad and/or skewed x - ray fe k@xmath2 emission lines , first discovered by asca , are extensively studied ( e.g. fabian et al .",
    "1995 , tanaka et al .",
    "1995 , bromley , miller & pariev 1998 ) .",
    "if appropriate accretion disk models in kerr spacetime are assumed , one can explain these broadening features for some spin parameters of central black holes .",
    "some authors actually propose some values of spin parameters of supermassive black holes ( e.g. miller et al .",
    "melia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) said that they constrain the black hole spin in sagittarius a * by sub - millimeter timing observations .",
    "recently , by high - resolution infrared observations of sagittarius a * genzel et al . ( 2003 ) estimates the spin parameter of the massive black hole in sgr a*. these two methods crucially depend on a period of a matter rounding marginally stable orbit with keplerian velocity . in the case of a optically thin accretion flow like bondi - type flow",
    "in which an angular momentum of an accreting matter is smaller than keplerian and radial velocity of the matter is large , it is open to question whether a period of a marginally stable orbit determine a minimum time of variability .",
    "other methods to determine a spin parameter of a black hole are proposed .",
    "x - ray polarized emission from an accretion disk around a black hole ( e.g. conners , stark & piran 1980 ) , microlensing light curves due to a black hole as a lensing object ( e.g. asada , kasai & yamamoto 2003 ) and gravitational wave emission from a star orbiting around a black hole ( e.g. tanaka et al .",
    "1996 , finn & thorne 2000 ) are also influenced by a black hole rotation .",
    "observation of a black hole shadow is another possible method to determine a spin parameter of a rotating black hole in future .",
    "this is because in the vicinity of a black hole null geodesics directly reflect effects of black hole rotation , such as frame dragging . as falcke ,",
    "melia & agol ( 2000 ) pointed out , in the case of sgr a * radio interferometers with sufficient spatial resolutions may resolve the central black hole shadows in the optically thin emitting medium by observations of sub - millimeter wavelength .",
    "a shape of a black hole shadow in an optically thin medium are deformed by black hole rotation ( e.g. bardeen 1973 , chandrasekhar 1983 , falcke , melia & agol 2000 ) .",

    "@xmath15 , a black hole shadow have an elongated shape in a direction of a rotation axis of a black hole ( e.g. bardeen 1973 , chandrasekhar 1983 , falcke , melia & agol 2000 ) .",
    "if such an elongation feature of a black hole shadow in optically thin emitting medium is observed , the spin parameter of the black hole can be determined by fitting a contour of a black hole shadow given by equations ( [ shadow0 ] ) and ( [ shadow1 ] ) to the observed image .    on the other hand , in the case of a black hole in an optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disk , is it possible to measure a spin parameter of a black hole from observation of a black hole shadow ?",
    "one of the main purposes of the present paper is to answer this . a contour of a black hole shadow in an accretion disk is basically calculated by cunningham & bardeen ( 1972 ) and cunningham ( 1973 , 1975 ) for a rotating black hole .",
    "luminet ( 1979 ) and fukue & yokoyama ( 1988 ) calculate apparent images of black hole shadows in accretion disks for non - rotating black holes . in the case of a rotating black hole , such as a deformed black hole shadow in optically thin medium",
    "as mentioned above , one might firstly think that a spin parameter of a black hole can be determined from a deformed shape of a black hole shadow due to a black hole rotation .",
    "actually , many authors calculate such deformed shadows due to black hole rotation in various contexts ( cunningham & bardeen 1972 , cunningham 1973 , 1975 , sikora 1979 , perez & wagoner 1991 , jaroszynski , wambsganss , & paczyski 1992 , kindl 1995 , quien , wehrse & kindl 1996 , begelman & rees 1996 , hollywood & melia 1995 , 1997 , bromley , miller & pariev 1998 , pariev & bromley 1998 , bromley , melia & liu 2001 ) . in the present paper , we show black hole shadows in accretion disks with quite similar shapes for largely different spin parameters of central black holes .",
    "when we calculate a shape of a black hole shadow in an accretion disk , an innermost radius of a luminous part of an accretion disk is significantly important .",
    "traditionally , as an emitting disk surrounding a black hole , the standard disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 , novikov & thorne 1973 ) is used . in such a disk , the innermost radius of",
    "the luminous part of the accretion disk corresponds to a marginally stable orbit if we neglect dimming effects due to gravitational redshift in the vicinity of the black hole .",
    "since the surface density inside this edge is expected to be extremely smaller than that outside the edge , it is usually assumed that there is no luminous matter inside the inner edge .",
    "however , it has not been proven whether the region inside the inner edge is non - luminous or not ( fukue 2003 ) .",
    "reynolds and begelman ( 1997 ) discuss in detail the possibility that the material within innermost stable orbit may be bright in the x - ray iron line .",
    "recently , from relativistic magnetohydrodynamical simulations , krolik & hawley ( 2002 ) proposed that the inner edge of an accretion disk around a black hole depends on the definition , i.e. turbulence edge , stress edge , reflection edge , and radiation edge are defined by each physical process . in the present study , we define the inner edge as an innermost radius of a luminous part of an accretion disk .",
    "also , in the case of a super - eddington accretion disk , an optically - thick luminous disk extends from a large radial distance to an event horizon ( e.g. watarai & mineshige 2003 ) , i.e. an innermost radius of a super - eddington accretion disk is smaller than a marginally stable orbit .",
    "this is because an effective potential based on an angular momentum distribution does not have a potential minimum for accretion rates , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the eddington luminosity ( watarai & mineshige 2003 ) .    in the present study ,",
    "we calculate contours of black hole shadows in geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disks for two kinds of innermost radii , a marginally stable orbit and an event horizon . when an innermost radius of an accretion disk is not close to an event horizon , the radiation from the underside of the accretion disks appear within a black hole shadow consisting of the direct orbits .",
    "since the intensity of such radiation is not strong , we neglect such radiation . in  2 , calculation methods are shown .",
    "we give a qualitative analysis and a quantitavive analysis of the shape and position of the black hole shadow casted by the rotating black hole in the center of the accretion disk for two kinds of innermost radii of accretion disks in  3 .",
    "we present quite similar black hole shadows for largely different spin parameters of black holes in  4 .",
    "we give discussion and conclusions in  5 .",
    "in this section , we briefly show a calculation method of a contour of a black hole shadow in kerr spacetime . the propagation of radiation from a matter around a kerr black hole is extensively studied by cunningham ( 1975 ) .",
    "the background metric is written by the boyer - lindquist coordinates with @xmath18 , @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the mass and angular momentum per unit mass of the black hole , respectively . in the present study",
    ", we assume an axisymmetric emitting matter distribution with respect to a rotation axis of a black hole .",
    "in such a case , a rotation axis of a black hole is equivalent to a rotation axis of an accretion disk . in the present study",
    ", we only consider a co - rotating accretion disk around a rotating black hole .",
    "since we assume the axisymmetric matter distribution with respect to a rotation axis of a black hole , we only need to calculate projected null geodesics on the @xmath22 plane in order to calculate a contour of a black hole shadow .",
    "an integral form of the geodesic equations of @xmath22-component can be written as ( e.g. carter 1968 , misner , thorne & wheeler 1973 , chandrasekhar 1983 ) @xmath23^{1/2 } } = \\pm\\int^r_{r_0}\\frac{dr}{[r(r)]^{1/2 } } ,   \\label{rtintegral}\\ ] ] where @xmath24r - q^2a^2 .",

    "two impact parameters @xmath3 in the plane of the sky of an observer can be expressed by the two constant , @xmath25 and @xmath26 , as ( bardeen 1973 , cunningham & bardeen 1972 , chandrasekhar 1983 ) @xmath31 where @xmath7 is an inclination angle between a rotation axis of accretion disk and a direction to an observer . as several authors have done ,",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 integrals of geodesics can be solved analytically by using elliptic integrals of the first kind and the second kind ( e.g. cunningham 1975 , rauch & blandford 1994 ) .",
    "these analytic solutions have many different sub - cases depending on the values of constants along the trajectory and the spin parameter of the black hole .",
    "also , the signs of the equation ( [ rtintegral ] ) are chosen independently ( carter 1968 ) and depend on the direction of the geodesics .",
    "rauch & blandford ( 1994 ) extensively studied these analytic solutions and the calculation method of the geodesics in a kerr metric .",
    "all patterns of analytic solutions of equation ( [ rtintegral ] ) are listed in tables in appendix a of rauch & blandford ( 1994 ) .",
    "note that while rauch & blandford ( 1994 ) give all analytic solutions of @xmath33-@xmath32 components of the geodesics in a kerr metric , rauch & blandford ( 1994 ) do not present the analytic solutions of the @xmath34-component and the @xmath8-component of the geodesics .",
    "for details of the calculation methods of the geodesics in a kerr metric , refer to rauch & blandford ( 1994 ) . in the present study , we use the analytic formulas of equation ( [ rtintegral ] ) .",
    "if we consider an observer at infinity from a black hole , in the equation ( [ rtintegral ] ) we set @xmath33 and @xmath32 components of an observer to be @xmath35 .",
    "when we need to specify @xmath36 , we use a value @xmath37 ( in units of @xmath38 ) . in the subsequent sections we calculate black hole shadows in thin accretion disks and we set a @xmath32 component of an end point of a geodesics to be @xmath39 in the equation ( [ rtintegral ] ) . in terms of an innermost radius of a luminous part of an accretion disk , we consider two types of radii as an example ; an event horizon @xmath40 and a marginally stable orbit @xmath41 .",
    "an event horizon of a black hole defined as @xmath42 , and an explicit form of a marginally stable orbit @xmath41 can be seen in bardeen , press & teukolsky ( 1972 ) .",
    "scales of black hole shadows in the present study are normalized by a gravitational radius , @xmath1 , defined as @xmath11 .",
    "in order to understand how a contour of a black hole shadow depend on a spin parameter , @xmath43 , of a black hole , an inner edge , @xmath44 , of an accretion disk and an inclination angles , @xmath7 , we plot in figure 1 contours of black holes shadows in optically thick accretion disks for @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 ( from _ left panels _ to _ right panels _ ) , @xmath48 ( _ thick solid lines _ ) and @xmath41 ( _ thin solid lines _ ) , and @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( from _ top panels _ to _ bottom panels _ ) .",
    "we also plot contours of black hole shadows casted by black holes in optically thin emitting matters ( e.g. bardeen 1973 , chandrasekhar 1983 , falcke , melia & agol 2000 ) by dashed lines in figure 1 .",
    "these shadows are calculated from equations ( [ shadow0 ] ) and ( [ shadow1 ] ) . as a reference frame , in all panels of figure 1 ,",
    "we also plot lines of @xmath53 and those of @xmath54 by dotted lines . the origin ,",
    "@xmath55 , is a position of a black hole , i.e. a mass center of a black hole . in this subsection",
    "we summarize qualitative features of contours of black hole shadows in accretion disks .",
    "these features are partly investigated in references cited in  1 . in subsequent subsections , we investigate black hole shadows quantitatively .    first , we see how a contour of a black hole shadow depends on an inclination angle , @xmath7 . in the case of @xmath49 , a shape of a black hole shadow",
    "is circle with its center at the origin , i.e. a position of a black hole mass center , for any black hole spin parameters because of axisymmetric luminous matter distribution with respect to a rotation axis of a black hole .",
    "although a size of a black hole shadow for an optically thin medium plotted by a dashed line is nearly independent of a black hole spin parameter , for both cases of shadows in disks with @xmath48 ( thick solid lines ) and @xmath56 ( thin solid lines ) the size of the black hole shadow become smaller for a more rapidly rotating black hole .",
    "this is simply because a radius of an event horizon and a marginally stable orbit become smaller for a more rapidly rotating black hole . in the case of finite inclination angles ,",
    "i.e. @xmath57 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 in figure 1 , since accretion disks non - axisymmetrically prevent null geodesics from plunging into a black hole horizon , black hole shadows for cases @xmath48 and @xmath56 deviate from circles , and slightly become flat shapes . in the case of a black hole shadow for optically thin medium , since there is no occultation by an accretion disk the shape of the black hole shadow is nearly circle even for a finite inclination angle and a finite value of a black hole spin parameter .",
    "especially , in the case of @xmath58 the black hole shadow in an accretion disk for cases @xmath48 or @xmath56 , underside of a black hole shadow which is seen in the case of a shadow in optically thin medium is partly occulted by an accretion disk . when an outer radius of an accretion disk is not so large , a black hole shadow consists of radiation from a backside of an accretion disk can be seen when viewing from nearly edge - on , @xmath14 . in the present study ,",
    "we assume sufficiently large accretion disks and do not consider radiation from the backside of an accretion disk .    in the case of @xmath48 ,",
    "a horizontal size of a black hole shadow becomes larger for a larger inclination angle . in the case of a finite inclination angle , in a region of an upper side ,",
    "i.e. @xmath59 , a length of a geodesics from an observer to a crossing point on an accretion disks becomes longer than a geodesics in the case of @xmath49 . in such cases , some geodesics crossing accretion disks when @xmath49 directly plunge into black hole horizon , and a size of a black hole shadow becomes larger for a larger inclination angle",
    "this effect is strong near a black hole . in the case of @xmath60",
    "a size of a black hole shadow becomes slightly larger for a larger inclination angle .",
    "but in the case of @xmath60 this effect is weaker than cases when @xmath48 .",
    "this is because when a marginally stable orbit is larger than an event horizon for a fixed spin parameter and in the case of @xmath48 geodesics consisting contours of black hole shadows are more strongly bent than those in the case of @xmath60 .    additionally , in the case of @xmath60 , a nearly maximum inclination angle , @xmath14 , and a non - rotating black hole , as seen in the left bottom panel in figure 1 , a black hole shadow has two tips near @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "upper side of a black hole shadow is made by geodesics from a back of a black hole and these geodesics are strongly bent by a strong gravitational field of a black hole . in the region",
    "relatively apart from a black hole , these bending effects are not so strong and geodesics become nearly newtonian . in such cases ,",
    "black hole shadows have tips which reflect nearly newtonian geodesics .",
    "so , if we put an accretion disk with an inner edge larger than a marginally stable orbit and we view such shadows with clear tips when a large inclination angle .",
    "as mentioned above , in the case of a rotating black hole for a larger spin parameter of a black hole an event horizon and a marginally stable orbit become smaller and a size of a black hole shadows also become smaller .",
    "but , this smallness of a black hole shadow is not unique properties of effects of black hole rotation . for a constant spin parameter of a black hole ,",
    "a size of a black hole shadow becomes smaller for a smaller inner edge of an accretion disk .",
    "also , for a constant spin parameter of a black hole and a constant inner edge of an accretion disk , a size of a black hole shadow becomes smaller for a smaller black hole mass .",
    "what is the unique property of black hole rotation ?",
    "although in the case of a non - rotating black hole a black hole shadow is perfectly symmetric with respect to a rotation axis of an accretion disk , as shown in figure 1 , in the case of a rotating black hole a black hole shadow becomes non - axisymmetric with respect to a rotation axis .",
    "this is because geodesics near a black hole suffers from effects of frame dragging and such a geodesic becomes non - axisymmetric with respect to a rotation axis .",
    "this non - axisymmetric shape of the black hole shadow can be also seen in past studies ( cunningham & bardeen 1972 , cunningham 1973 , 1975 , sikora 1979 , perez & wagoner 1991 , jaroszynski , wambsganss , & paczyski 1992 , kindl 1995 , quien , wehrse & kindl 1996 , begelman & rees 1996 , hollywood & melia 1997 , bromley , miller & pariev 1998 , pariev & bromley 1998 , bromley , melia & liu 2001 ) .",
    "if luminous matters around a black hole are distributed non - axisymmetrically , the non - axisymmetric property of a black hole shadow is not unique effect of black hole rotation .      in this section , we see quantitative features of the maximum size of a black hole shadow . in figure 2 , we show dependence of the maximum size of a black hole shadow on a spin parameter of a black hole and an inclination angle for three kinds of surrounding mediums ; an accretion disk with innermost radius of @xmath48 ( _ dotted lines _ ) and an accretion disk with @xmath60 ( _ solid lines _ ) , and optically thin emitting medium ( dash - dotted lines ) .",
    "note that the maximum size of a black hole shadow generally does not coincide with the maximum horizontal size of a black hole shadow because of black hole rotation . in figure 1",
    ", this feature can be clearly seen in black hole shadows in disks for @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we can see gravitational focusing effects of geodesics in figure 2 .",
    "for example , in the case of a non - rotating black hole a radius of a marginally stable orbit is 6 .",
    "so , a diameter of a circle of a marginally stable orbit is 12 .",
    "however , for an inclination angle @xmath49 , @xmath60 and a non - rotating black hole the maximum size of a black hole shadow is nealy 13.85 in figure 2 because of gravitational focusing effects .    for any spin parameter of a black hole , the maximum size of a black hole shadow becomes larger for a larger inclination angle .",
    "the reason for this is explained in the previous section . for any spin parameter of a black hole and a fixed inclination angle",
    "a black hole shadow in an accretion disk with @xmath48 is smallest among black hole shadows for these three kinds of surrounding medium . in the case of a slowly rotating black hole or a non - rotating black hole ( @xmath65 ) ,",
    "the maximum size of a black hole shadow around optically thin medium is among those in the cases of the other two disks for same inclination angle . on the other hand , in the case of a rapidly rotating black hole ( @xmath66 ) the maximum size of a black hole shadow around optically thin",
    "medium is larger than the black hole shadows in other two kinds of accretion disks for a fixed inclination angle .",
    "although the maximum size of a black hole shadow in optically thin medium concentrates on a narrow range of a size ( i.e. from @xmath67 to @xmath68 ) , the maximum size of a black hole shadow in an accretion disk expands a relatively wide range of a size .",
    "this is because the event horizon and marginally stable orbit depend on a spin parameter of a black hole as mentioned above .    in the case of an accretion disk with @xmath48 ,",
    "the maximum size of a black hole shadow is @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath45 . on the other hand ,",
    "the minimum size of a black hole shadow is @xmath71 for @xmath49 and @xmath72 . when an accretion disk with @xmath60 , the maximum size of a black hole shadow is @xmath73 for @xmath70 and @xmath45 , and the minimum size of a black hole shadow is @xmath74 for @xmath49 and @xmath72 .",
    "in contrast to the case of a black hole shadow in optically thin medium for which a size of a black hole shadow is in a narrow range as mentioned above , if an inner edge of an accretion disk is equal to or smaller than a marginally stable orbit , a size of a black hole shadow expands in a wider range from @xmath75 to @xmath76 than a black hole shadow in optically thin medium as shown in figure 2 .",
    "this is a remarkable quantitative feature of a black hole shadow in an accretion disk .      here ,",
    "for a single black hole shadow we consider a ratio of the minimum width of a black hole shadow to the maximum width of a black hole shadow .",
    "this ratio is important because this ratio is a good indicator of an inclination angle between a rotation axis of a black hole and a direction of an observer .",
    "this ratio is similar to a flatness of a black hole shadow .",
    "this ratio is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "note that a line segment of the minimum width and a line segment of the maximum width generally do not cross perpendicularly . in figure 3",
    ", we show dependence of the ratio on a spin parameter of a black hole for three inclination angles ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) and two kinds of accretion disks with @xmath48 ( _ dotted lines _ ) and @xmath60 ( _ solid lines _ ) . in the case of an inclination angle of @xmath49 ,",
    "this ratio is unity .",
    "although the ratio strongly depends on an inclination angle , the ratio weakly depends on a spin parameter of a black hole . in the both cases of black hole shadows in accretion disks with @xmath48 and @xmath60 , for an inclination angle @xmath58",
    "this ratio is nearly 0.5 for most of a range of a spin parameter .",
    "this value of @xmath77 is a lower limit of the ratio .      as mentioned in  3.1 , if we consider an axisymmetric luminous matter distribution with respect to a rotation axis of a black hole , a horizontal shift of a black hole shadow , which is a displacement of a shadow center in the direction of @xmath9 axis , shows a significant unique property of effects of a black hole rotation . in order to quantify this shift , we define @xmath9 coordinates , @xmath78 , as @xmath79 where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the maximum @xmath9-coordinate and the minimum @xmath9-coordinate of a contour of a black hole shadow , respectively . in the case of a non - rotating black hole ,",
    "a shape and a position of a black hole shadow are symmetric with respect to a rotation axis of a black hole , i.e. @xmath10 axis .",
    "so , in this case , @xmath82 . on the other hand , in the case of a rotating black hole a shape and a position of a black hole shadow is not symmetric with respect to a rotation axis of a black hole .",
    "so , in this case a value of @xmath83 is finite .",
    "this is because frame dragging effects of geodesics due to a black hole rotation break the symmetric property of a black hole shadow with respect to a rotation axis .    in figure 4",
    ", we show the shift of the center of the black hole shadow in the direction of @xmath9 axis for three inclination angles ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) and two kinds of accretion disks with @xmath48 ( _ dotted lines _ ) and @xmath60 ( _ solid lines _ ) . in this figure",
    ", we can see that an extent of the horizontal shift is roughly proportional to a spin parameter of a black hole for a fixed inclination angle .",
    "an extent of the maximum horizontal shift is about @xmath84 in the case of the maximum rotation , the maximum inclination angle and @xmath48 .",
    "a horizontal shift for the case of @xmath48 is larger than that for the case of @xmath60 for same inclination angle and same spin parameter of a black hole .",
    "this is because effects of frame dragging due to black hole rotation are more significant in a nearer region of a black hole .",
    "these strong frame dragging effects result in a large shift of a black hole shadow in @xmath9 direction . if we can measure this horizontal shift observationally , we can well constrain a spin parameter of a black hole . for example , in the case of an accretion disk with an inner edge between an event horizon and a marginally stable orbit , a spin parameter of a black hole is constrained between 0.65 and 0.83 for an inclination angle of @xmath57 and a horizontal shift of @xmath85 . here , we assume a geometrically thin accretion disk . in order to measure a horizontal shift of a black hole shadow , which is a good indicator of a spin parameter of a black hole , we need to know a position of a rotation axis of a black hole and a position of a center of a black hole shadow",
    ". however , it seems to be difficult to determine a position of a rotation axis of black holes observationally .",
    "so , although a horizontal shift of a black hole shadow is a good indicator of a spin parameter of a black hole , this method is not a practical method to determine a spin parameter of a black hole by observation of a black hole shadow .",
    "if we can determine a position of a rotation axis of a black hole by some methods , this method is practical for determination of a spin parameter of a black hole . in the next section ,",
    "we consider another method to determine a spin parameter of a black hole from an image of a black hole shadow .",
    "in principle , we can determine a spin parameter of a black hole @xmath43 , an inclination angle @xmath7 and an innermost radius of an accretion disk by fitting a calculated contour of a black hole shadow to an observed image of a black hole shadow obtained by observational facilities with sufficient spatial resolutions and sufficient detection limits even in the case that the position of a black hole shadow are not known .",
    "however , it is practically difficult to determine spin parameters of black hole shadows by this fitting method .",
    "this is because there are black hole shadows with a quite similar shape and size for largely different spin parameters of black holes . in figure 5 , we show examples of such black hole shadows with nearly same maximum width of a black hole shadow and nearly same ratio of the minimum width to the maximum width of a black hole shadow .",
    "the maximum widths of the black hole shadows are @xmath86 for black hole shadows in panels of ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , and @xmath87 for black hole shadows in panels of ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) , respectively .",
    "the flatness ratios are @xmath88 for black hole shadows in panels of ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , and @xmath89 for black hole shadows in panels of ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) , respectively . here ,",
    "the adapted parameters are ( a ) @xmath45 , @xmath57 and @xmath48 , ( b ) @xmath90 , @xmath57 and @xmath91 , ( c ) @xmath92 , @xmath57 and @xmath60 , ( d ) @xmath45 , @xmath64 and @xmath48 , ( e ) @xmath90 , @xmath64 and @xmath91 and ( f ) @xmath93 , @xmath64 and @xmath60 . in each panel of figure 5 , a position of a black hole mass center is plotted by a white dot .",
    "a rotation axis of an accretion disk is plotted by a gray line . in the case of a rotating black hole ,",
    "this line is also a rotation axis of a black hole .",
    "a horizontal direction in each panel of figure 5 represents a direction of the maximum width of a black hole shadow . as shown in figure 1 and figure 4 , in the case of a finite spin parameter of a black hole , a black hole shadow is non - axisymmetric with respect to a rotation axis of a black hole . in figure 5 , extents of shifts of centers of black holes from rotation axes of black holes are ( b ) 0.22 , ( c ) 0.38 , ( e ) 0.50 and ( f ) 0.95 , respectively . as mentioned above these shifts",
    "are nearly proportional to spin parameters of black holes ( see figure 4 ) . in the case of a rotating black hole",
    "a direction of a segment of the maximum width of a black holes is not perpendicular to a rotation axis of a black hole .",
    "thus , as panels of ( b ) , ( c ) , ( e ) and ( f ) show , rotation axes of black holes are inclined from vertical directions .",
    "these inclination angles from vertical directions are ( b ) @xmath94 , ( c ) @xmath95 , ( e ) @xmath96 and ( f ) @xmath97 , respectively .",
    "one of the largely different points between black hole shadows with a similar shape and a size is a distance between a rotation axis of an accretion disk and a center of a black hole shadow .",
    "if we know a position of a rotation axis of a black hole , a spin parameter of a black hole can be well constrained from an image of a black hole shadow .",
    "but , as mentioned in the previous section , it seems difficult to determine a position of a rotation axis of a black hole .    here",
    ", we newly introduce a bisector axis of a black hole shadow named _ a shadow axis_. we define this shadow axis as a bisector perpendicular to a line segment of the maximum width of a black hole shadow . in each panel of figure 5 , we plot this shadow axis by a white line in the case of a rotating black hole . in the case of a non - rotating black hole ,",
    "a shadow axis coincides with a rotation axis of a black hole shadow .",
    "we can easily determine a position of the shadow axis by observation of a black hole shadow in an accretion disk .",
    "in figure 5 , the minimum intervals between a mass center of a black hole and a shadow axis are ( b ) 0.32 , ( c ) 0.58 , ( e ) 0.59 and ( f ) 1.1 , respectively .",
    "this minimum interval strongly depends on a spin parameter of a black hole and can be measured if a position of a mass center of a black hole is known and a black hole shadow is observed .",
    "so , in the next section , we investigate a relation between a spin parameter of a black hole and the minimum interval between a mass center of a black hole and a shadow axis .      in figure 6 ,",
    "we plot the minimum interval between a black hole mass center and a shadow axis for all range of a spin parameter of a black hole .",
    "figure 6 is similar to figure 4 , but there are differences between lines in figure 4 and those in figure 6 . in figure 6 , we plot the minimum intervals for three inclination angles ( @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) and two kinds of accretion disks with @xmath48 ( _ dotted lines _ ) and @xmath60 ( _ solid lines _ ) . as mentioned in  3.1 , for a non - rotating black hole around an axisymmetric luminous accretion disk with respect to a rotation axis of a black hole",
    ", a black hole shadow is symmetric with respect to a rotation axis of a black hole .",
    "thus , in figure 6 for a non - rotating black hole , i.e. @xmath45 , the minimum interval is null . on the other hand , in the case of a rotating black hole ,",
    "i.e. @xmath98 , the shape and position of the black hole shadow is not symmetric with respect to a rotation axis of a black hole .",
    "so , in such case the minimum interval is finite . in figure 6 , we can see that an extent of the minimum interval is roughly proportional to a spin parameter of a black hole for a fixed inclination angle .",
    "the maximum extent of the minimum interval is about @xmath99 in the case of the maximum rotation , the maximum inclination angle and @xmath48 .",
    "the minimum interval for the case of @xmath48 is larger than the minimum interval for the case of @xmath60 for same inclination angle and same spin parameter of a black hole .",
    "this is because effects of frame dragging due to black hole rotation are more significant in a nearer region of a black hole , as mentioned in the previous section .",
    "if we can measure such minimum interval , a spin parameter of a black hole can be well constrained .",
    "but if not , quite subtle fitting of a contour of a black hole shadow to an observed image of a black hole shadow is required in order to determine a spin parameter of a black hole and other physical parameters from an observed image of a black hole shadow .",
    "for example , for an accretion disk with an inner edge between an event horizon and a marginally stable orbit with an inclination angle of @xmath57 and a horizontal shift of a black hole shadow to be @xmath46 , from figure 6 a spin parameter of a black hole is constrained between 0.75 and 0.89 . thus , _ in order to measure a spin parameter of a black hole it is crucially important to determine a position of black hole mass center in a region of a black hole shadow .",
    "_ required positional accuracy to determine a spin parameter of a black hole is lower than about @xmath99 ( in units of @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is the case of the maximum shift of black hole shadow center from a rotation axis . in the last section ,",
    "we discuss determination methods of a mass center of a black hole .",
    "note that in order to determine a spin parameter of a black hole from an image of a black hole shadow we do not always need to determine a position of a black hole mass center .",
    "for some cases , we can determine a spin parameter of a black hole by fitting a calculated contour of a black hole shadow to an observed image of a black hole shadow .",
    "one of the examples of such cases is a black hole shadow with tips which can be seen when a relatively large inner edge of an accretion disk as mentioned in  3.1 . in bottom panels of figure 1 ,",
    "in the case of @xmath60 there are tips in contours of black hole shadows for @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "when @xmath45 there are two tips , when @xmath90 there is a single tip and when @xmath63 there is no tips .",
    "so , if there are one or two tips in contours of black hole shadows , fitting of a calculated contour of a black hole shadow to an observed black hole shadow is more easy than the cases with no tips in a contour of a black hole shadow .",
    "but , the black hole shadow with tips is a quite limited case .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , in order to measure a spin parameter of a black hole from an observed image of a black hole shadow it is important to determine a position of a black hole mass center . in the case of sgr a * , stellar motions around black holes",
    "are actually observed ( e.g. genzel et al . 2003 ) . from these stellar motions , in principle we can determine the position of a mass center of a black hole .",
    "astrometry satellite missions with positional accuracy of 10 @xmath100 arc second which will give a plenty of data of stellar motions around sgr a * are planned : gaia for optical observation ( e.g. belokurov & evans 2002 and references therein ) and jasmine ( japan astrometry satellite mission for infrared exploration ) ( gouda 2002 ) for infrared observation in which effects of interstellar absorption and scattering are not very significant compared to those of optical observation .",
    "there is a simple additional method to determine a black hole mass center .",
    "distribution of brightness of the radiation from the accreting material around the black hole are influenced by the doppler and gravitational boosting effects .",
    "for example , luminet ( 1979 ) provides detailed derivations and discussions of the brightness distribution over the image of the accretion disk . on the other hand , an angular momentum , @xmath101 , of the frame dragging due to a black hole rotation",
    "is described as , @xmath102 in the equatorial plane , this angular momentum is expanded as @xmath103 because the frame dragging effect decreases in proportion to @xmath104 as shown here for a sufficiently large radial distance , @xmath33 , from a mass center of a black hole , and the gravitational potential decreases only proportional to @xmath105 , the frame dragging effects on the propagation of photons become negligible at a sufficient distance from the black hole . the image at these large radii is formed only by the influence of doppler effect from the moving gas and gravitational redshift in a spherically symmetric potential .",
    "this image should be clearly visible , since the shadow of the black hole is assumed to be clearly visible .",
    "if the motions and density distribution of the gas are axisymmetric , than the image at large radii would be the same as produced by a non - rotating black hole .",
    "one can then use calculations by luminet ( 1979 ) to fit the observed brightness distribution and determine the center of mass and the position of the rotation axis of the black hole as the parameters of this fit .",
    "then , it makes sense to use both figure 4 and figure 6 to constrain the spin parameter of the black hole .",
    "although in the present study we investigate black hole shadows in accretion disks from mainly academic interests as several past studies about black hole shadows in accretion disks ( e.g. luminet 1979 , fukue & yokoyama 1988 , fukue 2003 ) , observational feasibilities of black hole shadows must be considered .",
    "falcke , agol & melia ( 2000 ) shows that a black hole shadow in sgr a * can be observed at sub - millimeter wavelengths at which a scattering radius due to interstellar medium is sufficiently small in order to observe a black hole shadow .",
    "also , in nearby elliptical galaxy m87 there is a slightly smaller black hole shadow than that in sgr a*. both of observed spectrum of sgra * and m87 will be well reproduced by advection dominated accretion flows ( adafs ) or recently radiatively inefficient accretion flows ( riafs ) for sgr a*. in such accretion models , matter densities are quite low and it is expected that optically thick accretion disks are not formed .",
    "so , black hole shadows in sgr a * and m87 seems to be seen as black hole shadows not in accretion disks but in optically thin medium as falcke , melia & agol ( 2000 ) have calculated . in the case of m87 ,",
    "junor , viretta & livio ( 1999 ) report observations at 43 ghz of inner regions of m87 and shows a remarkably broad jet near the center and strong collimation of the jets occurring at @xmath106 schwarzschild radii from a black hole .",
    "these results are consistent with the hypothesis that jets are formed by an accretion disk around the central black hole . in the case of",
    "m87 we can not completely deny the observational feasibility of a black hole shadows in an accretion disk by next - generation radio interferometers .",
    "in such cases , the present study about black hole shadows in accretion disks is applicable to the black hole shadow in m87 .",
    "the central region of m87 is one of the observational targets of the planned next - generation vlbi space observatory program ( _ vsop-2 _ ) ( hirabayashi et al .",
    "2001 ) with extremely high resolution .",
    "theoretically , the black hole shadow in the center of m87 need more studies which include radiative transfer calculations with synchrotron source functions of accretion disks and jets .      in the present study",
    ", we make a qualitative analysis and a quantitative analysis of the shape and position of the black hole shadow casted by a rotating black hole on the optically thick accretion disk and its dependence on the angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "we consider two types of innermost radii , an event horizon and a marginally stable orbit , of an accretion disk .",
    "there are black hole shadows with quite similar sizes and shapes for largely different spin parameters of black holes and same masses of black holes . in the present study ,",
    "we newly introduce a bisector axis of a black hole shadow named a shadow axis .",
    "we define this shadow axis as a bisector perpendicular to a line segment of a maximum width of a black hole shadow .",
    "we can determine a position of shadow axis of a black hole shadow by observation of a black hole shadow .",
    "the minimum interval between a black hole mass center and a shadow axis is important .",
    "this is because the minimum interval is quite roughly proportional to a spin parameter of a black hole for a fixed inclination angle .",
    "the maximum extent of the minimum interval is about @xmath99 in the case of the maximum rotation , the maximum inclination angle and @xmath48 .",
    "if we can measure such minimum interval , i.e. if we can determine positions of a black hole mass center and a shadow axis , a spin parameter of a black hole can be well constrained .",
    "determination methods of a mass center of a black hole are discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "lastly , we adress the assumptions used in the present study . in the present study",
    "we only consider a geometrically thin accretion disk and calculate direct geodesics when calculating black hole shadows .",
    "an accretion disk with finite thickness may cause self - eclipsing effects of an accretion disk for large inclination angle and a black hole shadow may be deformed .",
    "so , this self - eclipse effect could be important for high inclination angles and need study in future .",
    "there are also geodesics which come from an underside of accretion disks .",
    "these photons also changes shapes of black hole shadows .",
    "this effect also need study in future .",
