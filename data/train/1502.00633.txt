    "curiously , the angle of the bar relative to the line - of - sight to the galactic centre ( gc ) was inferred to be @xmath13 in these studies , while the angle of the barred b / p bulge is accurately measured from the rcgs as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "study of n - body models suggested that the long bar and the b / p bulge data could be explained by a unique b / p bulge and bar structure formed by the buckling instability , if its two - dimensional outer bar component has developed leading ends through interaction with adjacent spiral arm heads @xcite .",
    "the buckling instability is a well studied process in n - body simulations @xcite .",
    "cold stellar discs embedded in live dark haloes naturally tend to form a bar which experiences long term secular evolution because of angular momentum transfer from the disc to the halo @xcite . during this secular evolution",

    "the goal of this paper is to combine n - body simulations of evolved stellar discs with recent mw data to create dynamical models of the galactic bulge and study its total mass , mass - to - light ratio , stellar mass and x - shape structure .",
    "to do so we use the 3d density of rcgs from ( * ? ? ?",

    "the modelling is detailed in section[section : dynamicalmodels ] where we present our best dynamical models and discuss the issue of the pattern speed of the bar . in section[section : mass ] , we show that we can recover the total mass in the bulge region with great accuracy , thereby relating the stellar mass to the dark matter mass in the bulge .",

    "our m2 m modelling of the gb relies on reasonable initial particle models of barred discs .",
    "these initial models were created by evolving near - equilibrium stellar discs embedded in live dark matter haloes .",
    "near - equilibrium models are constructed using the program magalie @xcite and evolved with the tree - code gyrfalcon @xcite , all distributed with the publicly available nemo toolbox @xcite . during the evolution",
    ", the disc naturally forms a bar which rapidly buckles out of the galactic plane and creates a b / p bulge @xcite .",
    "as we want to address the question of the total mass of the gb including the amount of dark matter in the bulge , we generated a set of five disc+halo n - body models using the same disc component and varying the halo properties .",

    "halos have a hernquist density profile with flattening of @xmath20 and a sharp cutoff at @xmath21 .",
    "all models contain two million particles , one million each for disc and halo . with these settings fixed only two free parameters",
    "remain : the halo mass inside the cutoff , @xmath22 , and the halo break radius of the hernquist profile , @xmath23 .",
    "they were fixed considering the total rotation curve of a model . following the language of @xcite",
    ", we call the _ degree of maximality _ of a disc the proportion of the disc contribution to the total velocity curve , at the radius where the disc velocity curve is maximal . assuming a flat rotation curve at large radii",
    ", we build a one parameter family of models parametrized by the degree of maximality of the disc .",
    "we make five models of this family , called m80 , m82.5 , m85 , m87.5 and m90 which have different degree of maximality ranging from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . as we show",
    "later this allows us to build models of barred galaxy which span all kind of rotators , from slow to fast .",

    "the solid black line is the circular velocity curve of the initial disc component ( common for all models ) and the vertical dashed line indicates the radius at which the degree of maximality is determined . as expected",

    "several studies based on different data sets indicate that the long bar of the mw ends at about @xmath28 .",
    "@xcite studied star counts of @xmath29 giants in several in - plane fields and places the end of the long bar at @xmath30 while @xcite found respectively values of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , based on rcgs counts from the 2masscatalogue and from ukidssdata .",
    "@xcite also found indication of a long bar for @xmath33 using star counts from the glimpsecatalogue .",
    "all these different estimates agree well with each other and give therefore a consistent length scale . with @xmath26 , a bar angle of @xmath31 and the end of the bar at @xmath34 ,",
    "the half length of the bar is @xmath35 .",
    "the different parameters quoted above constitute our fiducial set of parameters .",
    "we checked that our main results are not significantly affected by assuming a bar angle of @xmath36 instead of @xmath31 or a shorter bar half - length of @xmath37 ( see section[section : systematics ] ) , or by using @xmath38 instead of @xmath39 .",
    "we used ellipse fitting of the face - on projection of our models to compute their bar lengths , and scaled them to @xmath40 .",

    "the sampling of @xmath44 values we obtain is a consequence of the different haloes we used .",
    "the halo absorbs angular momentum during the bar formation and therefore the more maximal the initial disc , the less halo material there is to absorb angular momentum and so the faster the bar .",
    "one should keep in mind that for our set of models , the halo mass in the inner parts and the @xmath44 value are not independent parameters .",

    "all our models provide good fits of the rcgs density with a final @xmath60 from @xmath61 to @xmath62 .",
    "as the errors in the density are systematic , one should not over - interpret these @xmath57 values .",
    "the kinematics are also well fitted for all models with the model dispersions marginally steeper than the data for large @xmath63 and @xmath64 , and @xmath65 ranging from @xmath66 for model m80 to @xmath67 for model m90 .",
    "this kinematic @xmath57 is significantly better than that obtained by @xcite .",
    "given the scatter visible in the kinematic data , these models are good candidates to represent the mw bulge even if the kinematic @xmath68 is about @xmath69 .    because the different models all give a reasonable fit , we do not rule out some of them based on simple @xmath57 considerations .",
    "one has to be careful when drawing conclusions comparing @xmath57 values on typical m2 m problems .",
    "indeed , as shown by @xcite the common practice to use @xmath70 and @xmath57 statistics to evaluate confidence levels on @xmath71 is not appropriate for their m2 m results .",
    "the @xmath72 analysis requires a positive number of degrees of freedom , while it is usually negative in m2 m problems because the particles are vastly more numerous than the data constraints .",
    "hence , the @xmath73 given in table[table : chi2fitting ] are only an indication of the distance between model and data .",
    "these values are also strongly influenced by a few data points which appear to be possible outliers .",
    "this is the case for example in the fields at @xmath74 .",
    "removing these possible outliers reduces the absolute value of the kinematic @xmath75 by about @xmath76 .",

    "m80 , m82.5 , m85 , m87.5 and m90 we get the values @xmath78 = 24.7 , \\ , 25.7 , \\ , 27.7 , \\ , 29.0 , \\",
    ", 28.8 $ ] .",
    "this shows that the pattern speed of the mw bar and bulge in absolute units , as determined by the combination of the rcgs density and the bravadata , is between @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "this is slightly lower than the value of @xmath81 determined by @xcite , also from the bravadata .",
    "the comparison with other determinations in the literature is discussed in section[section : discussionpatternspeed ] .",
    "our initial models were constructed with different dark matter haloes , and the bars formed in these models had different corotation radii and @xmath44 values @xmath82 based on their individual rotation curves ( fig.[fig : circularvelocity ] ) .",
    "after the rescaling during the nmagicfit , the rotation curves of all models are essentially identical in the inner @xmath83 , such that these models all provide equally good fits to the rcgs density and bravadata .",
    "this is displayed in fig.[fig : finalrotationcurve ] which shows the azimuthally averaged rotation curves of our best mass models , together with their disc and halo contributions .",
    "the models scaled outer rotation curves are different , however , consistent with the different @xmath44 values .",
    "this is not expected to influence the bulge dynamics , because very few stars from @xmath84 and beyond will reach the bravabulge fields along their orbits .    because no effort has been made to match the rotation curve of the mw at large radii",
    ", the models @xmath44 ratio does not correspond to that of the mw .",
    "there are several ways in which the outer rotation curve of the mw could have changed after the bar and bulge formed , e.g. , by later growth of the disc .",
    "therefore , in order to estimate the corotation radius and @xmath44 of the galaxy corresponding to @xmath85 we need to use additional data . assuming the composite rotation curve of @xcite rescaled to @xmath86 , this range of pattern speed would result in a corotation radius between @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which implies @xmath44 between @xmath69 and @xmath45 .",
    "the mw would then belong to the so - called slow rotators .",
    "this result is discussed in more detail in section[section : discussionpatternspeed ] .      as an independent check",
    "we predict proper motion dispersions @xmath89 in the @xmath90 and @xmath91 direction for our best dynamical models as explained in section[section : propermotionobservables ] , and compare them to the data from @xcite .",
    "a comparison model / data is shown in fig.[fig : pm ] for @xmath92 ( left - hand plot ) and @xmath93 ( right - hand plot ) .",
    "the different colours refer to the five best dynamical models , and the shaded regions display different levels of relative error of the model with respect to the data .",
    "data error bars are not plotted : errors given by @xcite are only statistical errors at the level of @xmath94 or better . however , reproducing their derivation of @xmath89 from the original motions of individual stars in a couple of fields , it seems to us that systematic errors dominate .",
    "these systematic effects are due to the selection thresholds and have a typical magnitude of @xmath95 , which is indicated in fig.[fig : pm ] by the white band .",
    "our models provide good proper motion predictions in the @xmath90 direction , being mostly inside the @xmath95 limit .",
    "proper motions in the @xmath91 direction are slightly worse , with model values mostly @xmath95 to @xmath9 lower than the data .",
    "this hints at additional systematic errors , either in the models or in the data .",
    "@xmath93 is directly related to the vertical derivative of the potential and therefore to the mass concentration toward the midplane .",
    "this is apparent in fig.[fig : pm ] where models with a more massive stellar bulge component have larger @xmath93 .",
    "there is only limited scope for increasing @xmath93 in the models as will be discussed in section[section : discussiondarkhalo ] .",
    "@xcite noted that deviations of proper motion dispersions between adjacent fields could be as high as @xmath96 and concluded that some small systematic effect could indeed be present in the data .",
    "all together our models predict reasonable proper motion dispersions , indicating that the dynamics of the gb is quite constrained by the combination of the bravadata and the rcgs density .",
    "the stellar mass in the bulge - in - box ( @xmath97 , the inner @xmath0 of the gb ) is determined by the value of @xmath77 derived in the previous section together with the velocity scaling found by nmagicduring the fit .",
    "the stellar mass recovered this way differs from model to model , ranging from about @xmath98 for model m80 to @xmath99 for model m90 .",
    "this is expected given the fact that our models have different dark matter masses .",
    "more massive haloes ( like m80 ) can build the bravadispersion with relatively low stellar mass while low mass haloes need more stellar mass .",
    "all our models are good fits to the data , so purely from the bravadata we can not infer the stellar mass of the bulge accurately .",
    "however , our modelling gives us a very good estimate of the _ total _ mass of the bulge - in - box .",
    "fig.[fig : mass ] shows the stellar mass ( blue points ) and total mass ( red points ) of the @xmath97 for all models .",
    "we can see that our estimates of the total mass are quite constant along our range of model haloes .",
    "altogether we evaluate the total mass of the @xmath97 to be @xmath1 .",
    "the errors quoted here are combined statistical and systematic whose determination is discussed below .",
    "to estimate statistical errors , we use a @xmath100 analysis , based on two approaches .",
    "first , we regard the velocity dispersion profiles for a given model with different @xmath77 parameters as a one - parameter family of curves matched to the 82 bravavelocity dispersions , in which case the appropriate @xmath101 .",
    "this leads to an average uncertainty for the models of @xmath102 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "secondly , we consider the kinematic @xmath105-values of the best - fitting models from table[table : chi2fitting ] for the different dark matter haloes as the combination of a systematic variation modelled as linear , plus a fluctuating component which has a root mean square of rms@xmath106 . we take this as an approximation of the scatter in @xmath107 at minimum , which according to the simulations of @xcite",
    "can be taken as a proxy for the @xmath100 to be used for estimating the accuracy with which the mass can be determined from the data using nmagicmodelling . applying this to the combined @xmath107 curve derived from fig.[fig : chi2k ] results in estimated uncertainties of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath110 .",
    "based on both methods , we estimate the statistical uncertainty in the stellar and total mass measurement for the @xmath97 as @xmath111 , @xmath112 .",
    "our modelling relies on some assumptions whose influence on the derived bulge mass we now investigate .",
    "here we describe variations of our four main assumptions : the midplane extrapolation , the length scaling , the snapshot selection and the bar angle .",
    "we show that the effect of these assumptions on the estimate of the mass of the bulge is small .",
    "these test variations are then used to set the error on the mass measurement previously quoted .      .",
    "the colour shaded region depicts the errors in the density from @xcite and the dashed lines show the @xmath113 region where the original density map from @xcite has been extrapolated . ]    in order to quantify the uncertainty introduced by the assumed shape of the extrapolation in the midplane ( see section[section : m2mdensityobservable ] ) , we do the same study as detailed in section[section : dynamicalmodels ] with a variant extrapolation , more concentrated in the midplane .    in the fiducial case , we use the best @xmath114 fit to fill in the midplane . for our variant ,",
    "we perform an exponential extrapolation down to the midplane , with scale height @xmath115 varying as a function of the in plane coordinates @xmath116 ( see section[section : geometryandscaling ] ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath117 is proportional to the scale height of the best @xmath114 fit at large @xmath48 , normalized with numerical value fixed such that @xmath118 is equal to @xmath119 .",
    "the implied additional rcgs in the midplane strip increase the total number of rcgs in the @xmath97 by @xmath95 with respect to our fiducial extrapolation .",
    "we consider this extrapolation as giving extreme but still reasonable stellar concentration towards the midplane .",
    "the vertical density profiles along the major axis of this variant extrapolation are plotted along with our fiducial ones in fig.[fig : alternativeextrapolation ] . in this figure ,",
    "the different colours indicate the absolute value of the position along the @xmath120 axis , from red at the centre to blue at the edges of the 3d map .      in the fiducial case we scale our model using the length of the long bar , assuming that this long bar ends at @xmath121 .",
    "even though this assumption seems well founded , such a long bar is in clear tension with previous claims that the pattern speed of the milky way bar could be as high as @xmath122 ( see section[section : discussionpatternspeed ] )",
    ". ongoing work by wegg et al .",
    "( in preparation ) shows that the long bar can be reliably traced up to at least @xmath123 .",
    "hence we repeat our experiments by scaling our models on a long bar which would end at @xmath123 instead of @xmath31 . with the assumed bar angle and distance to the gc the semi - major axis of such",
    "a bar would be @xmath124 long .",
    "our fiducial study is based on initial models which are late evolutionary snapshots of pure disc+halo simulations . throughout its evolution",
    "the bar gives away angular momentum , slows down and builds a strong b / p bulge .",
    "as our target density has a very strong peanut shape , late evolutionary stages are a priori more suitable starting points for our modelling .",
    "however , when looking at the ratio of the size of the peanut shape to the length of the bar , we found that early evolutionary snapshots better match our target ratio .",
    "consequently we repeat the same modelling analysis using earlier snapshots , taken just after the buckling is complete .",
    "the angle between the major axis of the barred bulge and the sun - gc line has in the past generally been found in the range @xmath125 @xcite . in this study",
    "we assumed an angle of @xmath31 which is what wg13 measured with an accuracy of @xmath126 when making their 3d density map of rcgs in the bulge .",

    "the galactic bulge is no longer important and the flat long bar does not contribute significantly to the surface brightness for @xmath158 .",
    "hence the average surface brightness profile of the strips is mostly due to the disc component . by assuming that this disc vertical surface brightness profile stays constant at all longitudes inside @xmath159",
    "we can estimate and then remove the disc contamination from the cobe data .",

    "@xmath135 will be determined by matching our model surface brightness to the cobe / dirbe @xmath29-band data .",

    "we remove from the analysis all fields where this fraction is lower than @xmath170 , i.e. all fields where not directly constrained particles contribute more than @xmath171 of the model surface brightness . given that a single particle can theoretically dominate the surface brightness by being arbitrarily close to the sun s location , we also remove nearby disc particles from the analysis in the remaining fields by taking the following selection function :    @xmath172    we then apply the same foreground contamination correction to the model surface brightness as for the data , using the two strips at @xmath157 .",
    "we checked that our results do not depend on the exact form of the selection function , indicating that the foreground contamination has been properly removed .",

    "the positive residuals revealing the x - shape of the gb are shown in fig.[fig : medianfilter ] with contours spaced by a third of a magnitude .",
    "fig.[fig : medianfilter ] shows that the galactic bulge has an off - centred x - shape structure , its two arms crossing the major axis about @xmath181 away from the centre .",
    "this feature is identified in @xmath178 of external edge - on b / p bulges @xcite .",
    "consistent with the strong x - shape , the milky way bulge in the side - on map from wg13 shows a very prominent peanut shape .",
    "an interesting issue is the amount of stellar mass involved in this feature .",
    "this was already addressed by @xcite who applied a technique somewhat similar to unsharp masking to the side - on projection of the model of @xcite .",
    "they fitted ellipses to the isophotes of the side - on projection , modelled the light projected by these elliptical isophotes and removed the modelled light from the original image .",
    "doing so revealed a centred x - structure in the model accounting for about @xmath182 of the bulge stellar mass . because their model had been shown to give a good representation of the bravakinematic data",
    ", they then concluded that the stellar mass involved in the peanut shape of the gb was similarly about @xmath182 .",
    "since we now have a direct measurement of the 3d density of rcgs in the bulge , we can perform a similar photometric analysis directly on the 3d density map .",
    "consider the density profile @xmath183 along the minor axis of the bar .",
    "for each particular value of @xmath48 , we evaluate the 3d isodensity surface with density @xmath183 .",
    "then we look for the most voluminous ellipsoid we can find which fits _ inside _ this particular 3d isodensity surface .",
    "this search is done under the constraint that the ellipsoid is centred on the centre of the bulge , the principal axes are aligned with the principal axes of the bulge , the semi - principal length along the vertical axis is fixed to @xmath184 , and the ellipsoid stays inside the isodensity surface considered . by doing so for all @xmath48 we construct a family of ellipsoidal isodensity surfaces .",
    "we compute the 3d density arising from this ellipsoidal isodensity family and remove it from the original 3d map .",
    "the residuals correspond to the `` non - ellipsoidal '' part of the bulge density . as all our ellipsoids are truly inside their corresponding isodensity surfaces of the original map",
    ", we are assured that the residual map is positive at all points .    to reduce the effect of measurement errors in the original map of wg13",
    ", we actually do this analysis using model m80 , which through nmagicfitting of the density gives a smoother density map which is everywhere within the errors of the original map .",
    "we note that the results do not depend on which initial model is used for the density fit .",
    "the residual map is plotted in projection in fig.[fig : xshape ] .",
    "the four lobes responsible for the peanut shape of the bulge are clearly visible in the side - on view for @xmath185 . for @xmath186",
    "the peanut is not prominent enough with respect to its surroundings to make the density shape deviate from ellipsoidal shape .",
    "the stellar mass involved in this residual peanut shape is about @xmath187 of the total stellar mass of the bulge .",
    "this figure probably underestimates the real amount of mass involved in the peanut structure as one expects the orbits responsible for this structure to also visit the strip inside @xmath186 and therefore to contribute to the ellipsoidal density that was removed here .     of the rcgs in the bulge .",

    "we can estimate an error on the @xmath187 by applying the same procedure to each of the modelled five variant maps of wg13 .",
    "we find that the non - ellipsoidal residuals account for @xmath188 of the stellar mass of the bulge . by applying our diagnostic in a two dimensional version to the side - on projection of the density",
    ", we find that the 2d residuals sum to only @xmath189 of the stellar mass of the bulge , showing that 2d determinations tend to underestimate the mass in the peanut structure .    our peanut mass fraction of @xmath188 results from an observational definition of the peanut shape : a deviation from ellipsoidal density shape",
    ". a more physical definition of the peanut structure would be to identify the different orbits responsible for its shape in side - on projection .",
    "we are currently working on such an orbit - based characterization of the peanut shape which will be presented in a companion paper .",
    "the galactic b / p bulge transits into a longer two - dimensional bar ; therefore in this paper we use a simple definition for determining the dynamical mass of the bulge .",
    "we use the three - dimensional box @xmath0 as our bulge volume in which the rcgs density was determined by @xcite and which contains most of the three - dimensional bulge part of the bar .",
    "the total mass of this bulge - in - box ( @xmath97 ) is accurately determined by the dynamical models , @xmath190 .",
    "this value is essentially independent of the dark matter mass fraction in the bulge throughout our models , and the estimated error includes both statistical and systematic uncertainties ; the systematic part is determined from varying the modelling assumptions around our fiducial model .",
    "dynamical models have previously been used to estimate the mass of the bulge . using the schwarzschild method",
    ", @xcite built a self - consistent model of the bar / bulge and found a total bulge mass of @xmath191 while @xcite found a mass of @xmath192 by modelling an oblate isotropic rotator with a constant mass - to - light ratio . by studying gas dynamics in the potential of the model from @xcite obtained by deprojecting the cobe luminosity distribution",
    ", @xcite determined the circular velocity at @xmath193 to be @xmath194 .",
    "once converted to mass under the assumption of spherical symmetry , this leads to a total bulge mass of about @xmath195 .",
    "all these results compare well with our estimate of the mass of @xmath1 , especially when considering the difficulty of a precise definition of the bulge .",
    "an independent way to obtain a dynamical mass is from the virial theorem .",
    "such studies lead to quite different values depending on the assumed pattern speed and bar angle , from @xmath196 @xcite , up to @xmath197 @xcite obtained for a high pattern speed ( @xmath198 ) .",
    "the use of the virial theorem has two weaknesses .",
    "first , it relies on an estimation of the total kinetic energy , which can not be measured accurately from line - of - sight data only .",
    "secondly , it assumes that the bulge on its own is a system in equilibrium , whereas it is in fact part of a bar embedded in a disc .",
    "traditionally , the contribution of dark matter to the mass in the bulge region has been considered unimportant . in this case , a bulge mass can be estimated simply from the stars .",
    "for example , @xcite estimated the stellar mass of the bulge at @xmath199 from the cobe luminosity and a salpeter imf .",
    "however , neglecting dark matter in the bulge is not a good approximation as we have seen in section[section : mass ] .      because the total mass of the bulge - in - box ( @xmath97 ) is well determined , knowing the stellar mass",
    "independently would give insight into the amount of dark matter in the central part of the galaxy .",
    "as shown in section[section : mtolandrcgdensity ] , the stellar mass can be constrained by comparing mass - to - light and mass - to - clump ratio measurements with stellar population synthesis predictions .",
    "however , for this the choice of the imf is crucial : candidate imfs disagree within a factor of two in their prediction of the stellar mass - to - light ratio , so a reliable measurement of the imf in the gb is needed . currently , the zoccali imf @xcite measured from the bulge star luminosity function in a field located near @xmath200 is the favoured imf for the gb . for this case ,",
    "the predicted mass - to - light ratio from isochrones ( section[section : populationsynthesis ] ) gives a stellar mass for the @xmath97 of @xmath201 . from our modelling , both the mass - to - light and the mass - to - clump ratio independently agree that models with fairly high dark matter mass fraction are required to provide the remaining part of the dynamical mass in the @xmath97 .",
    "these models predict a dark matter mass in the @xmath97 of @xmath202 , accounting for about @xmath176 of the total mass of the @xmath97 .    further insight on the dark matter part of the @xmath97 mass can be obtained from proper motions .",
    "in particular , the proper motion dispersions in the @xmath91 direction directly constrain the derivative of the potential along the vertical direction , and therefore the total mass concentration towards the plane .",
    "we showed in section[section : pm ] that our proper motion predictions @xmath93 are @xmath95 to @xmath9 lower than the data .",
    "increasing the stellar mass concentration towards the plane as in section[section : variantextrapolation ] can indeed increase @xmath93 , but only at percent level which is not significant enough .",
    "it is also possible that a systematic effect is present in the data , e.g. , due to extinction or incompleteness of the sample .",
    "before we can use the proper motion data to measure the mass concentration and dark matter content of the gb , these possible systematic effects in the data need to be better understood .",
    "a more detailed study of the proper motion constraints is part of our ongoing work to make a more complete model of the galactic bulge and long bar .",
    "our dynamical models , based on the rcgs density from @xcite together with the bravakinematic data for the bulge stars , imply a pattern speed of the mw bar - bulge of @xmath203 ( see section[section : dynamicalmodelspatternspeed ] ) .",
    "this result remains unchanged when varying the modelling assumptions , for example when we consider a shorter bar , as detailed in section[section : systematics ] . comparing with the composite rotation curve from @xcite",
    ", this would place the corotation value of the bar just inside the solar circle , and give a ratio of corotation over bar half length between @xmath69 and @xmath45 .",
    "the mw would then belong to the so - called slow rotators .",
    "slow rotators are quite rare for external galaxies in general @xcite , but fairly common among sbc galaxies @xcite .",
    "there have been a quite a number of pattern speed measurements in the mw by other techniques .",
    "the bulk of the measurements indicate a fast bar , but some studies suggest a lower pattern speed ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "direct measurement by @xcite using a variant of the tremaine & weinberg method @xcite leads to the high value of @xmath204 but depends strongly on the radial velocity of the local standard of rest towards the gc .",
    "numerous indirect measurements of the bar pattern speed have been obtained by matching some of the observed features in the position - velocity diagrams for hi and co to gas - dynamical model predictions .",
    "most of these studies argue for a high pattern speed , such as @xcite who found @xmath205 , @xcite who obtained @xmath206 , and @xcite with @xmath207 .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite obtained lower values of respectively @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "high pattern speeds were also obtained by explaining the stellar kinematics of nearby disc stars with the dynamical effects of the outer lindblad resonance ( olr ) of the bar . by interpreting the bimodality of the velocity distribution in the solar neighbourhood in this way",
    ", @xcite found @xmath210 .",
    "@xcite presented an analytical model of the effect of the olr in the velocity distributions of stars at different radii and showed that they could reproduce measurements of the hercules stream for a bar pattern speed of @xmath211 .",
    "the low pattern speed value found from the rcgs and bravadata is consistent with @xcite and @xcite but not with the majority of these measurements .",
    "we note that models based on variants of the rcgs density map as well as models constrained by a model b / p bulge density independent of the rcgs measurement @xcite give similarly low values .",
    "the bravakinematics are in agreement with the argoskinematics @xcite despite the quite different selection functions of both surveys . in our modelling",
    ", the details of the selection function assumed for the bravadata were not important .",
    "therefore our value measured from modelling the bulge kinematics appears robust .",
    "the highest pattern speeds reported in the literature are also in conflict with other data .",
    "using the composite rotation curve from @xcite , a pattern speed of @xmath212 would place corotation at @xmath213 . because the long bar can not extend beyond corotation @xcite ,",
    "this is incompatible with the apparent end of the long bar at @xmath28 @xcite . even if we relax the hypothesis that the long bar ends at @xmath121 , recent star counts from the ukidsssurvey ( wegg et al .  in preparation ) show that it can be reliably traceable at least out to @xmath123 .",
    "this gives a lower bound of the half - length of the bar of @xmath124 , still in tension with a pattern speed of @xmath214 .",
    "we conclude that despite of the many effort made by different groups , the question of the pattern speed of the galactic bar remains an unsolved issue .",
    "one way to settle this question by dynamical modelling would be to include data that more accurately constrain the long bar component , which is one of our future goals .",
    "in this work we have presented a set of self - consistent dynamical models of the galactic bulge with different dark matter haloes , which match recent data on the spatial distribution and kinematics of bulge stars .",
    "we started with a family of n - body models of barred discs with b / p bulges , evolved from near - equilibrium stellar discs embedded in live dark matter haloes .",
    "we then fitted these models to the recent 3d density measurements of red clump giants in the bulge from @xcite , as well as to the bravakinematic data of @xcite in multiple bulge fields , using the nmagicmade - to - measure method .    from this modelling",
    ", we obtain an accurate and robust estimate of the total mass ( stellar and dark matter ) of the bulge in the rcgs box , of @xmath190 .",
    "we also find a low pattern speed of about @xmath215 , which with the measured rotation curve places the milky way among the slow rotators ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "we compute the mass - to - light and mass - to clump ratios and compare them with theoretical predictions from population synthesis models using different imfs .",
    "we show that the salpeter imf @xcite is ruled out for a @xmath4 old bulge population .",
    "we find that a relatively high dark matter mass fraction in the bulge is needed in order to match predictions from the imf inferred from the stellar luminosity function in the upper bulge @xcite , @xmath5 or @xmath216 .",
    "in addition we study the x - shape of the galactic bulge and find an off - centred x - shape , common in external b / p bulges @xcite . by a three - dimensional analysis of the isodensity surfaces of the rcgs density we find that the peanut - shaped deviations from ellipsoidal shape account for @xmath188 of the bulge stellar mass , significantly larger than the previous estimate of @xmath182 of @xcite .",
