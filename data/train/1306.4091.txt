    "by now , the existence of dark matter is well accepted . in addition , cosmic acceleration discovered in 1998 @xcite is one of the most important discoveries in the last century .",

    "a positive value of @xmath14 implies that there is dark radiation in the universe . if there is any dark radiation , it changes the energy budget at recombination and has significant imprint in the anisotropies of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "but the dark radiation becomes ignorable in the late time universe , and then the dark radiation does not affect the fitting to the data of baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) @xcite , supernova legacy survey ( snls ) samples @xcite , the combination of supernova union2.1 compilation of 580 sne ( union2.1 ) @xcite and hubble space telescope ( hst ) project @xcite .",

    ", some tensions between planck and some other astrophysical datasets are also intriguing . here",
    "we mainly focus on two significant tensions : + @xmath15 even though the bao data excellently agrees with planck in the base @xmath2cdm model , the @xmath0 prior from hst is h_0=(73.82.4 )  km  s^-1  mpc^-1  ( 68%  cl ;  hst ) which is discrepant with the planck estimate in the base @xmath2cdm model at about @xmath16 level .",
    "note that the constraint on @xmath0 from planck+wmap polarization ( wp ) is h_0=(67.31.2 )  km  s^-1  mpc^-1  ( 68%  cl ;  planck+wp ) .",
    "see section 5.3 of @xcite in detail .",
    "+ @xmath15 even though there is no obvious inconsistency between the sne samples , the posterior distribution for @xmath1 from planck+wp in the base @xmath2cdm model is in some tension with the distribution from snls .",

    "in addition , we find that there is correlation between @xmath14 and the spectral index @xmath23 , because the dark radiation can suppress the high-@xmath35 power spectrum and a redder - tilted primordial power can make a similar effect on the high-@xmath35 power spectrum .",
