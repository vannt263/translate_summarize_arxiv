    "compact binary coalescence ( cbc ) events , such as neutron star or black hole mergers , are one of the primary gravitational - wave sources for ground - based interferometers such as ligo .",
    "ligo s third ( s3 , oct 31 2003 - jan 9 2004 ) and fourth ( s4 , feb 22 2005 - mar 23 2005 ) science runs have reached significant extragalactic distances @xcite into the nearby universe . especially for massive compact binaries whose components are black holes , the range extended beyond the virgo cluster . to interpret the searches for signals from compact binary coalescence in the ligo data sets ,",
    "it is necessary to use information about putative binary compact object populations in the known nearby galaxies , as well as how the population scales at larger distances .",
    "the nearby galaxy catalog discussed here represents the distribution of such extragalactic populations , and the procedures described are used for ligo data analysis , such as assigning an astrophysically meaningful upper limits given non - detection . an accurate upper - limit that correctly incorporates our best information about galaxy distributions requires a model of the nearby overdense region because the current ligo network s range probes this overdensity .",
    "binary compact objects are usually produced from the evolution of massive stellar binaries . since short - lived",
    ", massive stars emit more blue light than all other stars in a galaxy combined , blue light is a well - known tracer of star formation in general and the birthrate of these massive stars in particular . given the short lifetimes of the known milky way double compact object population and the slow rate of change in star formation expected in nearby and distant galaxies , @xcite has argued that a galaxy s blue luminosity should linearly scale with its compact binary coalescence rate .",
    "the sensitivity of ligo to compact binary coalescence signals depends on the distance and sky position of the coalescence event and therefore , the distribution of known nearby galaxies in blue luminosity and in space is the minimum information needed to properly interpret searches of the ligo data sets .",
    "it is possible that compact binary populations that are not related to regions of star formation may exist in the universe .",
    "a mass , metallicity and morphology dependent star formation history may be needed to account for these populations ) .",
    "their study also differs from ours because we consider issues like antenna pattern of the detector and completeness corrections , which they ignore . ] .",
    "nevertheless , the work described here is limited to the blue - light luminosity as a tracer of the compact binary population .",
    "the contribution of elliptical galaxies to the merger rates is potentially significant beyond the virgo cluster @xcite , whereas their blue luminosity is not representative of their putative compact binary populations .",
    "however , at large distances , the fractional blue luminosity produced in ellipticals is about @xmath0 @xcite , and at short distances the contribution is negligible because there are fewer ellipticals in the nearby local universe .",
    "@xcite conclude that the event rate for an elliptical galaxy with the same blue luminosity as a spiral galaxy is a factor of five times larger on average .",
    "we conclude that ligo rate upper limits derived from the catalog presented here would change by less than a factor of 1.5 due to a correction for elliptical galaxies",
    ".    our blue light census will also implicitly not account for any potential contribution from globular clusters to the compact binary coalescence rate of the nearby universe .",
    "@xcite has argued that the contribution of globular clusters to double neutron star mergers in the galaxy would not exceed 10 % of the coalescence rate due to the galactic field . on the other hand",
    "it has been argued that the contribution of globular clusters to binary black hole coalescence may be very significant ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , these cluster contributions are expected to become significant at distances beyond the virgo cluster , where a more significant fraction of ellipticals with large globular - cluster systems will eventually enter ligo s detection volume .",
    "we have used mostly publicly available astronomical catalogs of galaxies to compile a catalog used in the s3/s4/s5 ( fifth science run , nov 4 2005 - present ) ligo data set analyses .",
    "we discuss the methodology used to compile this galaxy catalog and briefly describe how this information feeds into ligo rate estimates . in  [ section2 ] , we describe all the elements involved in compiling the galaxy catalog and assessing the relevant errors and uncertainties . in ",
    "[ section3 ]",
    ", we derive a correction factor to account for incompleteness in the catalog guided also by the blue - light volume density estimated from the sloan digital sky survey and earlier surveys . in  [ section4 ] , we discuss how the corrected catalog and resulting blue light distribution as a function of distance is used to bound the rate of compact binary coalescence using data from the recent ligo science runs .",
    "if the maximum distance to which a search could detect a compact binary coalescence is known , then the expected number of detectable events can be derived .",
    "some concluding remarks are made in  [ section5 ] .",
    "we have compiled a catalog , the _ compact binary coalescence galaxy _ catalog or cbcg - catalog , of nearby galaxies which could host compact binary systems . for each galaxy out to 100 mpc , the catalog provides the equatorial coordinates , distance to the galaxy , and the blue luminosity corrected for absorption .",
    "estimates of the systematic errors on distance and luminosity are also provided .",
    "the cbcg - catalog is compiled from information provided in the following four astronomical catalogs : ( i ) the hubble space telescope ( hst ) key project catalog used to measure the hubble constant @xcite , ( ii ) mateo s dwarf galaxies of the local group catalog @xcite , ( iii ) the hyperleda ( leda ) database of galaxies @xcite , and ( iv ) an updated version of the tully nearby galaxy catalog @xcite .",
    "when combining these catalogs , distances and luminosities reported in the hst , mateo and tully catalogs were generally adopted over those in the leda catalog .",
    "this is because these catalogs use accurate distance determination methods compared to leda .",
    "nevertheless , leda served as the baseline for comparisons in the range 10 - 100 mpc since it is the most complete .",
    "one of the primary objectives of the hst key project was to discover cepheid variables ( stars which have periodic variations in brightness ) in several nearby spiral galaxies and measure their distances accurately using the period - luminosity relation for cepheids .",
    "cepheid distance determination to nearby galaxies is one of the most important and accurate primary distance indicators . the distance information from the hst key project is considered to be the most accurate in the cbcg - catalog ; there are 30 galaxies in our catalog for which we adopt distances from the hst key project .",
    "mateo s review @xcite of properties of the dwarf galaxies in the local group provides distance and luminosity information for each galaxy considered . since the parameters in this catalog were derived from focused studies on each individual galaxy , we consider it the most accurate next to the hst measurements for nearby galaxies .",
    "moreover it has reasonably comprehensive information on the local group s dwarf galaxies ; there are 18 sources in the cbcg - catalog which adopt distances ( and luminosities ) from mateo s compilation .",
    "it becomes increasingly difficult to use primary distance estimators like cepheid stars in more distant galaxies .",
    "therefore secondary distance methods are used to measure larger distances .",
    "tully s catalog has up to three types of distances for each source : ( i)_quality distance _ ( @xmath1 ) is based on either cepheid measurements , surface brightness fluctuations , or the tip of the red giant branch .",
    "there are 409 galaxies with such a distance in the cbcg - catalog .",
    "( ii ) _ hi luminosity - line - width _ distances ( @xmath2 ) are obtained from the tully - fisher relation , where the maximum rotational velocity of a galaxy ( measured by the doppler broadening of the 21-cm radio emission line of neutral hydrogen ) is correlated with the luminosity ( in b , r , i and h bands ) to find the distances .",
    "there are 553 galaxies in the catalog with such a distance .",
    "( iii ) _ model distance _ ( @xmath3 ) is derived from an evolved dynamical mass model that translates galaxy radial velocities into distances .",
    "this model is an update of the least action model described by @xcite and takes into account the deviations from a perfect hubble flow due to a spherically symmetric distribution of mass centered on the virgo cluster .",
    "all galaxies have a calculated model distance .",
    "whenever available , @xmath1 distances are the most preferred due to their smaller uncertainties , then the @xmath2 followed by @xmath3 .",
    "the remaining galaxies come from leda which does not provide distances explicitly , but instead provides measured radial velocities corrected for in - fall of the local group towards the virgo cluster ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we obtain the leda distance ( @xmath5 ) using hubble s law with the hubble constant @xmath6 reported by @xcite .",
    "although corrections to the recessional velocity were made , this method of calculating distances is still highly uncertain .",
    "hence , we use hubble s law to evaluate the distances only to the galaxies for which @xmath7 km / s ( 7mpc ) and peculiar velocities are expected to be more of a perturbation .",
    "the error in a distance depends strongly on the method used to measure that distance .",
    "the hst sources , though a small contribution to the galaxy catalog , have the smallest errors ( @xmath8 ) @xcite .",
    "the three different distance methods in tully s catalog have different errors .",
    "@xmath1 also has a low error ( @xmath0 ) followed by the @xmath2 ( @xmath9 ) . to obtain an estimate for the errors of @xmath3 ,",
    "we compare them with @xmath1 for the set of galaxies that have both types of distance estimates .",
    "the best fit gaussian ( see fig .  [ tullydistanceerrors ] ) to the logarithm of fractional errors has a one sigma width of @xmath10 which when subtracted in quadrature with @xmath1 error gives , @xmath11 distance error associated with @xmath3 .",
    "because errors in @xmath4 are not given in leda , we follow a similar procedure to find leda distance errors , @xmath5 .",
    "we compare the calculated @xmath5 with @xmath1 for galaxies in both catalogs to obtain uncertainty estimates in @xmath5 . the plot in fig .",
    "[ distanceerrors ] shows the best fit gaussian to the logarithm of fractional errors with a one sigma width of @xmath12 which , subtracted in quadrature with @xmath1 distance errors , gives a total distance error @xmath13 .      the distribution of binary compact objects in the nearby universe is expected to follow the star formation in the universe and a measure of star formation is the blue luminosity of galaxies corrected for dust extinction and reddening @xcite .",
    "hence , for each galaxy , we calculate the blue luminosity @xmath14 from the absolute blue magnitude of the galaxy @xmath15 ( corrected for internal and galactic extinctions ) . for convenience ,",
    "blue luminosity is provided in units of @xmath16 , where @xmath17 ergs / s is the blue solar luminosity derived from the blue solar magnitude @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we do not consider galaxies with luminosities less than @xmath19 because they do not contribute significantly to the total luminosity  see  [ section3 ] .",
    "the mateo , tully and leda catalogs provide information on apparent b - magnitudes corrected for extinction .",
    "the galaxies in the hst key project catalog have only distance information , so for those we extract the corresponding apparent magnitude values ( @xmath20 , corrected for internal and galactic extinction ) in the b - band from the tully catalog to find @xmath15 .",
    "table  [ table1 ] summarizes relevant properties of each of these catalogs and the fraction of the total luminosity within 100 mpc that each contributes .",
    "[ table1 ]    [ cols= \" < , < , < ,",
    "< , < , > \" , ]",
    "whether one wishes to compute expected detection rates for ligo searches , or to interpret ligo searches as rate upper limits ( or eventually detection rates ) , we require at the simplest level accurate accounting of the total observable blue luminosity @xmath21 .",
    "as mentioned in the previous sections , a galaxy catalog complete with sky positions and distances is important for first generation ligo detectors because the blue luminosity is not uniformly distributed in the sky within the search range . an upper limit which takes in to account",
    "the most up - to - date information on galaxy distribution can be obtained by accurately modeling the local overdense region . for searches with ranges",
    "well beyond current sensitivity the universe is uniform and rate estimates depend primarily on accurate blue luminosity densities corrected for reddening .",
    "we have introduced a method to bridge the gap between the well known nearby galaxy distribution and the expected long range distribution through a completeness correction based on sdss luminosity functions @xcite .",
    "this paper provides the most up to date accounting of nearby galaxies within 100mpc as well as errors in the apparent magnitude ( corrected for reddening ) and distance and demonstrates how the errors propagate into rate calculations .",
    "astrophysical errors are a significant contribution to the eventual systematic error associated with coalescence rate upper limits @xcite and must be included .",
    "this paper provides a survey of the asymptotic and local uncertainty .",
    "motivated by the use of effective distance to account for the antenna pattern of the ligo detectors , we demonstrate the need to compute the average blue light luminosity within a given effective distance sphere . for ranges within 50mpc there is a nontrivial relationship between cumulative blue luminosity within an effective distance sphere and within a physical distance sphere . beyond 50mpc the relationship is well behaved leading to the simple scaling for the number of detected events @xmath22 given in eq.([e : nevents - approx ] ) .",
    "we would like to point that the catalog provided can also be used on other astronomical analysis of populations that scale with galaxy blue luminosity , such as the local type ii supernova rate or the rate of nearby sgr bursts that show up as short grbs .",
    "we provide sufficient description of our methods for others to apply new rate models to future ligo data .",
    "although this catalog will serve as a reference for current and future ligo data analysis , we look forward to future work that may transcend the simple blue light rate normalization that we have discussed .",
    "one way to go beyond blue light rate normalization , ( necessary to ascertain the degree to which old stars contribute to present day mergers ) is with multiband photometry of nearby galaxies which can reconstruct their mass , morphology and metallicity dependent star formation history . with this information in hand ligo detections",
    "could be applied more stringently to assess the relative contribution that progenitors of different ages provide to the present day merger rate .",
    "we would like to thank b. tully for generously providing his most up to date nearby galaxies catalog in the preparation of this work .",
    "we acknowledge the usage of the hyperleda database ( http://leda.univ-lyon1.fr ) .",
