    "the kepler mission ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , which was aimed to detect extrasolar planets , has provided unprecedentedly sampled data on several cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "this satellite also recorded previously unknown cvs as by - products of the main target stars .",
    "the best documented example has been the background dwarf nova of kic 4378554 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to this object , the group planet hunters @xcite detected several candidate background cvs.http://talk.planethunters.org/objects/aph51255246/ + discussions / dph101e5xe@xmath1 . ]",
    "we studied one of these background dwarf novae , the one in the field of kic 11412044 ( hereafter j1944 ) .",
    "this object was discovered by the planet hunters group as a background su uma - type dwarf nova of kic 11412044 , in which superoutbursts and frequent normal outbursts were recognized.http://keplerlightcurves.blogspot.jp/2012/07/ + dwarf-novae-candidates-at-planet.html@xmath1 . ]",
    "since it was bright enough and it was frequently included in the aperture mask of kic 11412044 , the outburst behavior can be immediately recognized in kepler sap_flux light curve of kic 11412044 .",
    "( 160mm,230mm)fig1.eps     ( 160mm,120mm)fig2_s.eps     ( 88mm,88mm)fig3.eps    we used kepler public long cadence ( lc ) data ( q1q17 ) for analysis . since the outbursts were immediately recognizable in each light curve of the kepler target pixel images , we used a custom aperture consisting of 46 pixels showing outbursts as we did in the background dwarf nova of kic 4378554 @xcite .",
    "we used surrounding pixels to subtract the background from kic 11412044 .",
    "we further corrected small long - term baseline variations by subtracting a locally - weighted polynomial regression ( lowess : @xcite ) and spline functions .",
    "since the quiescent magnitude is difficult to determine , we artificially set the level to be 22.0 mag .",
    "the resultant light curve indicates that this object is an su uma - type dwarf nova with frequent outbursts ( figure [ fig : j1944lc ] ) .",
    "there were eight observed superoutbursts , and from the regular pattern , another superoutburst most likely occurred between bjd 2455553 and 2455568 ( a data gap in q8 ) and we numbered the superoutburst and supercycle assuming that there is a superoutburst in this gap .",
    "the intervals between successive superoutbursts ( supercycles ) were in a range of 120160  d. we determined the mean supercycle of 147(1 )  d. most of superoutbursts were associated with a precursor outburst with a various degree of separation from the main superoutburst .",
    "the typical duration of the superoutburst is @xmath28  d including the precursor part .",
    "this duration is shorter than those of many other su uma - type dwarf novae .    the number of normal outbursts in one supercycle ranged from 11 to 21 .",
    "the intervals of normal outbursts were 410  d , one of the shortest known except er uma stars @xcite .",
    "the amplitudes of normal outbursts increased as the supercycle phase progresses .",
    "some of the normal outbursts were `` failed '' , i.e. they decayed before reaching the full maximum .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig : j1944spec2d ] , a two - dimensional fourier analysis ( using the hann window function ) of the light curve of this object yielded two periods .",
    "there was a signal of a constant frequency ( 18.93 cycle d@xmath3 ) with the almost constant strength . using all the data segment",
    ", we determined the period to be 0.0528164(4 )  d ( 18.934 cycle d@xmath3 ) .",
    "we refer this signal to `` 0.0528  d '' signal . based on the high stability of the 0.0528  d signal during the entire kepler observations , we identified this period to be the orbital period ( @xmath4 ) of this object . during superoutbursts ,",
    "there were transient signals of superhumps at frequencies around 18.118.5 cycle d@xmath3 as expected .",
    "let us now examine the source position of the background dwarf nova in figure [ fig : kepmap ] .",
    "we checked the pixels which showed the dwarf nova - type variation .",
    "the peak of signal of dwarf nova - type outbursts was found two pixels away from the center of kic 11412044 ( star 1 on the dss image ) . at this location , there is a galex @xcite ultraviolet source galex j194419.33@xmath0491257.0 [ nuv magnitude 21.3(3 ) ] and we identified this source as the uv counterpart of this dwarf nova ( figure [ fig : kepmap ] , q16 ) , confirming the suggestion in the planet hunters page . the superhump component and 0.0528  d component",
    "were also confirmed at the location of this object ( figure [ fig : kepmap ] , q14 ) , and we consider that the 0.0528  d signal indeed comes from this dwarf nova .",
    "this has also been confirmed by the non - detection of the 0.0528  d signal in the sap_flux of kic 11412044 when this dwarf nova was outside the aperture of kic 11412044 .      since the superhump period is less than three lc exposures , it is difficult to determine the times of superhump maxima by the conventional method .",
    "we employed the markov - chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) modeling used in @xcite .",
    "although we only show the result of so3 ( figure [ fig : j1944humpall ] ) , the pattern is similar in other superoutbursts . in the @xmath5 diagram , stages a  c ( for an explanation of these stages , see @xcite ) can be recognized .",
    "long - period superhumps ( stage a superhumps ) with growing superhumps were recorded during the late part of the precursor outburst to the maximum of the superoutburst .",
    "the overall pattern is very similar to those of other su uma - type dwarf novae , including v1504 cyg and v344 lyr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the object makes the fourth case ( after v1504 cyg , v344 lyr and v516 lyr ) in the kepler field in which the growing superhumps lead smoothly from the precursor to the main superoutburst and thus gives further support to the thermal - tidal instability ( tti ) model @xcite as the explanation for the superoutburst .",
    "@xcite recently proposed that stage a superhumps can be used to determine the mass ratio ( @xmath8 ) and the resultant mass ratios are as accurate as those obtained from eclipse modeling .",
    "we have succeeded in measuring the period of stage a superhump during the three superoutbursts : 0.0555(2 )  d ( so3 ) , 0.05546(5 )  d ( so6 ) , 0.05552(6 )  d ( so7 ) .",
    "the corresponding fractional superhump excesses in the frequency unit @xmath9 are 4.8% , 4.77% and 4.88% .",
    "these values correspond to the @xmath10 value of 0.14 , 0.139 and 0.143 , respectively .",
    "we therefore adopted @xmath10=0.141(2 ) .",
    "this mass ratio implies a massive ( approximately two times more massive ) secondary for this very short orbital period comparable to most wz sge - type dwarf novae ( figure [ fig : evolloc ] ) .",
    "this result may alternatively suggest the possibility of an unusually low - mass white dwarf .",
    "if we assume that the secondary of j1944 has a normal mass for this orbital period , such as 0.066@xmath11 in wz sge @xcite , the mass of the white dwarf must be @xmath20.47@xmath11 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the fraction of cvs having white dwarf lighter than 0.5@xmath11 is only 7@xmath123 % , even including suspicions measurements .",
    "furthermore , there is evidence from modern eclipse observations that mass of the white dwarf in short-@xmath4 cvs is not diverse @xcite .",
    "we therefore consider the interpretation of a massive secondary more likely .",
    "the presence of precursor outburst and the high frequency of normal outbursts are usual features of longer-@xmath4 systems such as v1504 cyg and v344 lyr .",
    "systems with @xmath4 like j1944 are usually wz sge - type dwarf novae with very rare ( super)outbursts ( e.g. @xcite ) or er uma - type dwarf novae , a rare subgroup with very frequent outbursts and short supercycles ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "j1944 does not match the properties of either group .",
    "this can be understood if the outburst properties are a reflection of the mass ratio rather than the orbital period since the @xmath10 value of j1944 is closer to those of longer-@xmath4 su uma - type dwarf novae .",
    "the presence of such a system would pose a problem in terms of the cv evolution since the secondary loses its mass during the cv evolution and @xmath10 value is expected to be as low as @xmath20.08 around the orbital period of j1944 . in recent years",
    ", some objects showing hydrogen lines in their spectra ( this excludes the possibility of double - degenerate am cvn - type systems ) have been discovered around this period or even in shorter period .",
    "these objects include ei psc ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , v485 cen @xcite and gz cet @xcite .",
    "these objects are considered to be cvs whose secondary had an evolved core at the time of the contact , and are considered to be progenitors of am cvn - type double white dwarfs ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "none of these objects have been reported for @xmath10 determination directly from radial - velocity studies , and @xmath10 values have only been inferred from the traditional @xmath13 , which has an unknown uncertainty @xcite .",
    "the detection of stage a superhumps in j1944 allowed the first reliable determination of @xmath10 in such stripped - core ultracompact binaries .",
    "there is , however , a marked difference of the outburst frequency between j1944 and these known objects since the frequency of outbursts in such systems have been reported to be low @xcite .",
    "this suggests that j1944 has an anomalously high mass - transfer rate among these objects",
    ". the object may be in a phase analogous to er uma - type dwarf novae , whose high mass - transfer rates may be a result of a recent classical nova explosion ( cf .",
    "@xcite ; @xcite ) . since the object can be within the reach of the ground - based telescopes , the exact optical identification and the search for the feature of the secondary star are encouraged to solve the mystery .",
    "we thank the kepler mission team and the data calibration engineers for making kepler data available to the public .",
    "we also thank the planet hunters group for making their information on the background dwarf novae public which enabled us to study this interesting object .",
    "this work was supported by the grant - in - aid `` initiative for high - dimensional data - driven science through deepening of sparse modeling '' from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) of japan ."
