    "molecular dynamics ( md ) is a powerful simulation tool for atomistic- to nano - scale dynamic phenomena and nowadays widely used in a variety of research field such as crystal growths,@xcite defect formations,@xcite ion bombardment,@xcite radiation damages,@xcite ion conduction,@xcite thermal conduction,@xcite and chemical reactions.@xcite the validity of those simulation results depends strongly on the interatomic potentials used .",
    "an _ ab - initio _ md is an extreme example of the accurate interatomic potential , however , since it costs significantly more than the empirical potentials , it is not suitable for large - scale or long - time simulation",
    ". thus a lot of empirical interatomic potentials have been proposed since the md was invented .",
    "however , most empirical potentials developed so far reproduce limited physical quantities of a certain situation , since they have only a few basis functions such as one or two two - body terms , a three - body term , and a functional term.@xcite    under this circumstance , some studies of making more accurate interatomic potentials applicable for a variety of situations using many basis functions and machine - learning techniques have emerged such as the neural network ( nn ) potential,@xcite the gaussian approximation potential ( gap),@xcite and the linear regression ( lr ) potential.@xcite since these potentials use more basis functions than former empirical potentials that consist of one or a few functions , they reproduce reference values better and usually they are more accurate than the former potentials whereas they are much slower than the former potentials . comparing the nn and lr potentials ,",
    "the nn potential is expected to be more accurate than the lr potential in case of the same number of bases , since it has non - linear activation functions in the nn structure .",
    "this non - linearity is expected to work like bond - order@xcite or environment - dependent potentials.@xcite because of this , and also because we can control the accuracy and computational cost by choosing the number of layers and nodes in a layer , we adopt the nn potential in this paper",
    ". however , it is still heuristic that what kind of and how many basis functions should be used for the nn , and we have to find appropriate basis functions by trial - and - error .",
    "seko _ et al._@xcite showed that the number of bases in the lr potential can be drastically reduced retaining its accuracy by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator ( lasso ) technique .",
    "the lasso adds a penalty term to the function to be minimized and enables us to select important bases by eliminating other bases .",
    "this technique is very powerful to reduce and select bases relevant to the system considered , however , to the best of our knowledge , such a basis selection has not been employed in the nn potential .",
    "we adopt a similar sparsification technique , called the forward stepwise ( fs ) regression,@xcite which can usually sparsify more aggressively or reduce more bases than the lasso . with using the fs regression , important bases",
    "are selected and the number of bases in nn potential is reduced systematically and less heuristically .    in this paper , we create a nn potential for crystalline and liquid si system , since in spite of a lot of efforts to make accurate and general - purpose interatomic potential for si system , there is no sufficient one that can be used over the wide range of situation and well reproduces physical properties of crystalline structures , amorphous structures , and dynamic properties of liquid .",
    "for example , the stillinger - weber ( sw ) potential does not well reproduce some physical properties of a crystalline structure and needs further refinement of parameters,@xcite and the power spectra of velocity auto - correlation calculated using sw potential and tersoff potential@xcite do not agree with that of an _ ab - initio _ calculation.@xcite this paper compares some physical properties of a variety of situations obtained with the nn potential to those obtained with other potential and the density - functional theory ( dft ) calculation in the sec .

    "@xmath32 is the number of atoms in a structure-@xmath1 , and @xmath33 is the number of samples considered .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 is the conversion factor for forces that absorbs the difference of units between energy ( ev ) and force ( ev /  ) ; it is set 0.05 , which makes the force value 0.2 ev /  correspond to the energy value 0.01 ev .",
    "the force term is important if the potential is applied to some dynamics simulation.@xcite in order to select relevant and small number of bases , we adopt the fs regression approach.@xcite the fs regression in this study proceeds as follows :    1 .",
    "weights on lines connecting bases and 1st layer nodes @xmath35 are set zero and other weights are set non - zero .",

    "4 .   perform the minimization with respect to the current weight set @xmath36 until the convergence criterion , @xmath41 , is achieved or the iteration @xmath6 exceeds the maximum iteration number @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the @xmath44 value at @xmath6-th iteration .",
    "go back to 2 unless all the bases are selected .",
    "the number of iterations @xmath42 in the minimization at the step 4 should be large enough to find the minimum or at least the basin of the minimum in the @xmath36-space .",
    "however , since large @xmath42 results in a lot of computation time for the iteration of the outer loop , @xmath42 or the convergence criterion for the minimization is usually set moderate value determined empirically . since the fs regression searches the minimum near the origin of parameter space @xmath35 starting from the origin @xmath45 , over - fitting can be suppressed and a sparse nn model can be obtained as same as the lasso .",
    "the fs regression has an advantage against the lasso with regard to the computational cost of minimization , since the fs does not need to evaluate gradients of all weights but only the weights to be optimized @xmath36 during the inner minimization loop , whereas the lasso needs the gradients of all the weights",
    ". we can select the important bases that appears earlier than the other ones .",
    "the sample structures prepared in this work were chosen so that the nn potential can well reproduce the crystalline and amorphous si structures , some defect formation energies , and dynamical properties of liquid si the samples include : perfect crystalline si of some different crystal structure , such as diamond , fcc , bcc , and hcp ; crystalline structure which involves a si vacancy ; generalized stacking faults on ( 111 ) plane of diamond structure ; and uniform deformation , shear deformation , and random atom displacements of above mentioned structures ; and liquid si structures extracted from _ ab - initio _ md simulation runs .",
