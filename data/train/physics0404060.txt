    "low pressure radio - frequency ( rf ) inductive discharges have been extensively used over the past decade as sources of inductively coupled plasmas ( icp ) in the plasma aided material processing industry , semiconductor manufacturing , and lighting @xcite . for very low pressures , i.e. in the millitorr region the icp discharges exhibit a strong non - local behavior and a number of peculiar physical effects typical for warm plasmas , like an anomalous skin penetration and a resonant wave - particle interaction .",
    "the study of these effects leads to further optimization of the icp sources and can result in improvement of the characteristics of plasma - based devices .",
    "an interesting effect that can lead to enhanced heating for bounded , low - pressure plasmas is the possible bounce resonance between the frequency @xmath0 of the driving rf field and the frequency of the bounce motion of the plasma electrons confined in the potential well by an ambipolar potential @xmath1 and the sheath electric fields near the discharge walls @xcite .",
    "most earlier theoretical and numerical studies on this subject assumed for simplicity a uniform plasma density over the discharge length , and the absence of an ambipolar potential , i.e. allowed the electrons to bounce inside a potential that is flat inside the plasma and infinite at the walls @xcite .",
    "although these suppositions can result in a fairly good description of the plasma behavior under non - resonant conditions , the discharge parameters under resonant conditions can be greatly altered by accounting for the presence of the ambipolar potential , which  it should be stressed ",

    "it is a very well known result of the quasilinear theory , that for low - collisional discharges the plasma heating essentially depends on the so - called  resonant electrons , \" or electrons with velocities equal to the phase velocities @xmath2 of the plane waves constituting the rf field ( landau damping ) @xcite . for bounded plasmas and for an electron to be resonant , the above condition transforms into the requirement that the rf field frequency must be equal to , or be an integer multiple of the bounce electron frequency @xmath3 .",
    "but the electron bounce frequency is very sensitive to the actual shape of the ambipolar electrostatic potential @xmath1 , especially for low - energy electrons .",
    "accounting for the electrostatic potential can lead the plasma electrons into the resonant region even if they were not there in the absence of the potential .",
    "this can result into a drastic enhancement of the plasma heating and other related phenomena @xcite .",
    "in this article we present the results of a full , self - consistent numerical modelling of low pressure icp discharges under the bounce resonance condition and show the pronounced influence of the presence of the electrostatic ambipolar potential on the plasma parameters under resonant conditions .",
