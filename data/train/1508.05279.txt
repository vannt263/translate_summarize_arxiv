    "the quantum mechanics of electrons constrained in two dimensions has gained a lot of interest since the advent of the ( integer ) quantum hall and fractional quantum hall effects in the 1980s . over the years , the experimental techniques of probing these systems with precisely structured magnetic fields at low temperatures ( @xmath0 mk ) have been perfected .",
    "presently , magnetic fields that vary appreciably ( even ) in the nanometer scale can be created by fabricating thin films of ( a ) metal - excitable with a calculated current distribution , ( b ) ferromagnetic materials , ( c ) type - i superconducting materials , on a two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) system .",
    "interestingly , the magnetic field in these cases can be described in closed analytic form@xcite which , is an invitation for making very precise predictions for the behavior of 2degs subjected to such inhomogeneous fields .",
    "however , on the theoretical side we face a setback in considering arbitrary magnetic fields , as the schrdinger equation describing the electron - field interaction can seldom be solved analytically , except in very simple cases .",
    "often , powerful numerical methods offer a solution to this problem , albeit , at the loss of significant physical insight .    considering the difficulty of a generic 2deg - magnetic field interaction problem , we focus on a select class of magnetic fields ( perpendicular to the plane of the electron gas ) that are confined within an infinitely long strip of width @xmath1 .",
    "further , if the magnetic field varies across the strip ( only ) , remaining translation invariant along the length of the strip , an exact enumeration of the bound state energies and tunneling probabilities of the electron is possible for any form of inhomogeneity .",
    "we focus on the bound state problem here , reserving a discussion of scattering for a later paper .    besides , a significant chunk of the literature on magnetic strips is devoted to a study of electron tunneling through the magnetic field barrier@xcite while , relatively little is explored on the bound state solutions .",
    "bound state solutions of a linearly varying magnetic field were obtained by mller.@xcite even in this simple case , it is not possible to describe the electron wave functions in terms of any special function or finite analytic combinations thereof . even otherwise , bound state solutions are exceedingly special , as their existence is not necessarily guaranteed for a given magnetic field while , scattering states always exist ( for any given field variation ) when the energy is above a minimum threshold value .",
    "another nontrivial field variation that enjoys exact solvability is @xmath2@xcite in which , the discrete and continuous part of the spectrum overlap in an energy range and are selected by the @xmath3 momentum associated with the wave function .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to find the exact bound state energies ( landau levels ) for any given magnetic field variation ( whenever such levels exist ) .",
    "we formulate the problem in section  [ sec2 ] obtaining an effective one - dimensional magnetic potential for the electron .",
    "the criterion for the allowed bound state energies is obtained with an analytic transfer matrix ( atm ) approach in section  [ sec2.1 ] .",
    "section  [ sec3 ] is devoted to examples .",
    "firstly , in section  [ sec3.1 ] we obtain the landau levels ( lls ) of a magnetic strip that has a symmetric power law field variation . following which , we consider the problem of a 2deg placed under a ferromagnetic film in section  [ sec3.2 ] .",
    "unlike in the former example , the magnetic field in this case offers a fringing field outside the strip which , has a significant effect on the lls .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec4 ] outlining avenues of further study .",
    "an appendix at the end gives the proof of an important result used in section  [ sec2.1 ] .",
    "we place the 2deg on the @xmath4@xmath3 plane , subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field @xmath5 where , @xmath6 is the field strength and @xmath1 is the width of the strip .",
    "@xmath7 must be integrable .",
    "the vector potential for this field , in the landau gauge reads @xmath8 we set up a minimal coupling hamiltonian @xmath9 to describe the electron - field interaction where , @xmath10 is the effective mass of the electron with charge @xmath11 .",
    "the magnetic length @xmath12 and cyclotron frequency @xmath13 provide natural length and time scales in this problem . scaling the energy @xmath14 and",
    "the coordinates @xmath15 we obtain the schrdinger equation    @xmath16    satisfied by the wave function @xmath17 .",
    "the width of the strip in @xmath18 units is given by @xmath19 .",
    "since , the hamiltonian has a translation symmetry in the @xmath3 direction , the commutation identity @xmath20=0 $ ] holds good .",
    "thus , @xmath21 is a simultaneous eigenstate of @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "an ansatz @xmath24 would satisfy this requirement provided , @xmath25 solves the one - dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath26 we call @xmath27 the effective magnetic potential whose , shape is modulated by the @xmath3 momentum @xmath28 associated with the wave function .",
    "this makes the quantum mechanical behavior wave - vector dependent.@xcite we will explore many interesting possibilities that arise ( concerning the existence of bound states ) due to the presence of @xmath29 .",
    "note that outside the magnetic strip i.e. @xmath30 is constant as shown in fig .",
    "specifically , for @xmath31 , while for @xmath32 where , @xmath33 is proportional to the magnetic flux per unit length linked with the infinite strip ( see equation  ) .",
    "although , bound state solutions of equation   can be anticipated for energies @xmath34 ; for a given @xmath7 , the effective potential may not offer ` wells ' for containing the electron , in which case bound state solutions will not exist for any @xmath35 .",
    "this shape dependence makes bound states rather scarce unlike scattering solutions .      in this section",
    "we use the analytic transfer matrix method ( atmm ) to obtain an exact criterion for the allowed bound states in the effective potential @xmath27 .",
    "the atmm emerged in the problem of finding guided modes of the electromagnetic field in a graded - index optical fiber.@xcite the method was readily extended by the pioneers to apply to one - dimensional problems in quantum mechanics@xcite where , it has been remarkably successful not only as a calculation device for exact energy levels but also as a conceptual tool ; providing deeper insights into the working and limitations of semi classical quantization schemes like the bohr  sommerfeld and the wkb method ( and refinements of the same).@xcite these efforts also led to the conceptualization of the ` modified momentum ' which , substituted for the canonical momentum makes the bohr - sommerfeld quantization exact.@xcite the atmm , combined with super - symmetric techniques has also been applied to nontrivial potentials yielding promising results.@xcite    in order to keep the paper self - contained , we give a complete derivation of the atm quantization condition clarifying , a major ingredient in the derivation ( the phase losses at the classical turning points ) which , in our opinion has not been rigorously justified in previous accounts ( ref .",
    "appendix ) .",
    "additionally , we evaluate the atm quantization integral in closed form which , is a new development .     with classical turning points @xmath36 for energy @xmath35.[fig1 ] ]    consider two classical turning points @xmath37 and @xmath38 that solve @xmath39 in the region @xmath40 .",
    "the case of more than two turning points ( as with the energy @xmath41 in fig .  [ fig1 ] )",
    "is not addressed in this paper , as the atmm is not easily generalized for multiple turning points .",
    "we partition the sub intervals @xmath42 and @xmath43 into @xmath44 and @xmath45 segments respectively , each with width @xmath46 .",
    "thus , any intermediate point @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "certainly , @xmath49 and @xmath50 . the continuous potential is now replaced by a piecewise constant equivalent over these segments , such that the potential in the segment @xmath51 is @xmath52 .",
    "further , the solution of equation   in this segment is given by @xmath53 where , @xmath54 is the probability amplitude for the forward ( backward ) traveling wave component . in equation",
    "@xmath25 may be tagged explicitly to show the correspondence with the @xmath55^th^ segment .",
    "we prefer to infer this from the context . necessitating the continuity of the wave function and its derivative at the endpoints of the segment we arrive at the matrix equation @xmath56 where",
    ", the overhead dot denotes differentiation w.r.t @xmath57 .",
    "note that @xmath58 , since we assume no more than two classical turning points at this stage .",
    "few authors prefer separate formulae for the transfer matrix @xmath59 that hold when @xmath60 or otherwise . in view of this distinction",
    ", our expression corresponds to the former case , while the latter case i.e. @xmath61 , leading to an imaginary @xmath62 is easily addressed with the analytic continuation of the trigonometric functions into the complex plane in equation  .",
    "thus , recovering the other expression for the transfer matrix when the case arises . with this caveat",
    "we overcome the need for selective indexing of transfer matrix products .",
    "left multiplying equation   with @xmath63 and dividing by @xmath64 , we obtain @xmath65 through the tangent addition formula we obtain @xmath66 \\nonumber\\\\ \\rightarrow \\tan^{-1 } \\left(\\frac{p_{i } } { \\kappa_{i } } \\right)-\\tan^{-1 }   \\left(\\frac{p_{i+1 } } { \\kappa_{i } } \\right ) = z_{i } \\pi-\\kappa_{i } \\delta,\\,\\nonumber\\\\z_{i } = 0 , 1 , 2,\\ldots \\ ] ] note that @xmath67 satisfies the riccati equation @xmath68 which , has intimate connections with the schrdinger equation  @xcite .",
    "it is often advantageous ( as in the present case ) to develop identities involving @xmath69 . rearranging equation   and summing over @xmath55 from @xmath70 to @xmath71 yields @xmath72\\\\ & \\quad = n\\pi   + \\sum\\limits_{i = l+1}^{l+m }   \\left[\\tan^{-1 } \\left(\\frac{p_{i+1 } } { \\kappa   _ { i+1}}\\right)-\\tan^{-1 } \\left(\\frac{p_{i } } { \\kappa_{i } } \\right ) \\right]\\\\   & \\rightarrow \\sum\\limits_{i = l+1}^{l+m }   { \\kappa_{i } \\delta }    + \\sum\\limits_{i = l+1}^{l+m-1 }   \\left[\\tan^{-1 } \\left(\\frac{p_{i+1 } } { \\kappa   _ { i+1 } } \\right)-\\tan^{-1 } \\left(\\frac{p_{i+1 } } { \\kappa_{i } } \\right ) \\right]\\\\ & \\quad = n\\pi + \\tan^{-1 } \\left(\\frac{p_{l+m+1 } } { \\kappa_{l+m } } \\right)-\\tan   ^{-1 } { \\left(\\frac{p_{l+1 } } { \\kappa_{l+1 } } \\right ) }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the exact quantization condition emerges as a limit of equation   as @xmath73 . in the event of @xmath73 ,",
    "the continuous potential variation is recovered , with @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in the appendix",
    "we show that @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "further , @xmath78 which , gives the half phase losses at the classical turning points as @xmath79 further , @xmath80 which , results from expanding the inverse tangent in a tailor series in powers of @xmath81 .",
    "building on equation   we obtain    @xmath82    using equation  .",
    "thus , in the limit of @xmath73 , equation   reads @xmath83    which , is an exact criteria for the bound state wave function ( specified through @xmath69 ) and the corresponding energy that appears in @xmath69 and @xmath84 .",
    "interestingly , the above integral can be explicitly evaluated in terms of the function @xmath85 leading to @xmath86",
    "a magnetic field that varies as a simple power law is obtained by choosing @xmath87 we let @xmath88 to avoid a singularity at @xmath89 . in the limiting event of @xmath90 we approach a constant magnetic field . from equation",
    "we obtain @xmath91 substituting @xmath92 in equation  , we arrive at the effective magnetic potential @xmath93 in this case only two classical turning points exist for any combination of parameters .",
    "since @xmath94 is an increasing curve , a well appears in @xmath27 for @xmath95 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "consequently , wave functions with @xmath96 can only scatter through the magnetic field region .     for @xmath97 .",
    "in this example , wells appear when @xmath98 .",
    "( insets ) give the shapes of the highlighted regions where , the red curve ( middle ) corresponds to a symmetric well considered in equation  .",
    "[ fig2 ] ]    hence , we look for bound states in this range . also (",
    "as noted before ) the landau levels ( lls ) must populate the interval @xmath99 .    for @xmath100 ,",
    "the well becomes symmetric about the origin , described by @xmath101 we plot this symmetric - potential - well for select values of @xmath102 in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , with an inset displaying the variation of the well depth  given by @xmath103with @xmath102 .",
    "note that the wells take a parabolic shape as @xmath104 , which is the case with a constant magnetic field .",
    "also , as @xmath105 , the effective well spans the entire axis becoming infinitely deep .",
    "consequently , only bound states are permitted ( as landau had shown few decades ago ) .    from the bound state criterion derived above , we compute the first few lls in this symmetric well in fig .",
    "[ fig4a ] and study their variation with @xmath102 . clearly",
    ", the lls asymptote to those of the limiting constant magnetic field which , are shown by means of broken lines in fig .",
    "[ fig4a]with increasing @xmath102 .",
    "higher levels appear progressively , since the well - depth increases with @xmath106 ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] inset ) .",
    "we find that the highest ll@xmath107 .",
    "the well is always brim full ! combining this observation with the asymptotic behavior of the levels noted above gives an adequate estimate of the total number of lls ( say @xmath108 ) populating a particular well is obtained ( especially as @xmath109 ) .     in the region",
    "@xmath110 , @xmath111 . ( inset ) gives the asymptotic levelling of the well - depth in the event of @xmath90 .",
    "[ fig3 ] ]    @xmath112    in fig .",
    "[ fig4b ] we superpose the lls of the previous case with those corresponding to a larger @xmath113 . numerous higher levels ( red dots ) appear due to the increase in the well - depth .",
    "further , with increasing @xmath102 , the lls for either values of @xmath114 almost overlap which is emphasized by the boxed region in fig .  [ fig4b ] .    note that , even in the limit of @xmath90 ( describing a constant magnetic field ) the width of the strip remains finite ( since @xmath114 is fixed ) ; quite insensitive to which , the lls asymptote to the lls of a spatially - unbounded uniform field ( the landau problem ) .",
    "we recall that in the former case the wave functions outside the strip decay exponentially ( since the effective potential is constant out side the strip ) while , those in the latter case have gaussian tails .",
    "it thus turns out , despite a finite width , the lls overwhelmingly approach those of the spatially - unbounded uniform magnetic field for large enough values of @xmath102 .",
    "the symmetric power law magnetic fields considered above can not be realized with the experimental methods discussed in section  [ sec1 ] .",
    "however , they serve as good approximations to realistic magnetic fields . a crucial element that lacks in these ideal geometries",
    "is the presence of a fringing field outside the strip . for large sample sizes the fringing field can often be neglected . in this spirit",
    ", we had required that the magnetic field be strictly zero outside the strip ( equation  ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath27 became constant for @xmath115 , and an exact criterion for the lls could be obtained .",
    "now , we relax this constraint and allow the field to out - flank the strip ; with an understanding that the field vanishes progressively with distance from the strip . for these fields , most of the treatment remains same as before , except for a truncation of the effective potential far away from the classical turning points , which turns out to be a valid approximation , if the ll under consideration is much below the height of the effective potential at the truncation points.@xcite the consequent error can be overcome by choosing truncation points sufficiently far from the turning points , allowing the lls of interest to settle within the desired precision .",
    "consider a 2deg placed under a ferromagnetic film at a distance @xmath116 below it .",
    "for a vertically magnetized film of width ( thickness ) @xmath117 and magnetization per unit width @xmath118 , the magnetic field on the 2deg is given by @xmath119 when , @xmath120.@xcite the length of the strip is infinite as before .",
    "using equation   we obtain @xmath121     vs. @xmath122 for @xmath123 .",
    "( insets ) show the magnetic field variation @xmath7 for these values of @xmath124 .",
    "[ fig5 ] ]    which , leads to the effective magnetic potential @xmath125 in obtaining the effective potential we scaled @xmath126 and used the definition @xmath127 .    due to the interplay of the parameters describing the effective - potential ,",
    "many interesting possibilities arise .",
    "first of all , unlike in the former example , @xmath27 varies ( appreciably ) over the entire @xmath57 axis tending to @xmath128 as @xmath129 .",
    "secondly , the effective potential in this case possesses a special reflection symmetry @xmath130 , which implies that the energy eigenvalues of equation   for bound state solutions remain invariant under the transformation @xmath131 .",
    "thus , the lls are _ doubly _ degenerate . from this property",
    ", it suffices to study the spectrum for @xmath96 .",
    "further , for an energy @xmath132 , there can exist at the most four classical turning points given by @xmath133 one or more of which might vanish  in the event of @xmath134get repeated or become complex . in the interest of bound states , four ( distinct )",
    "turning points may correspond to an energy within a double - well shaped potential , while two repeated ( coincident ) turning points would occur when the energy hits the top of the barrier between the two wells . and , higher energies would give rise to ( only ) two real turning points .",
    "these cases are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) .",
    "a clearer perspective of the ` motion ' of the tuning points ( in the complex @xmath57 plane ) is obtained by examining their loci ( ref .",
    "[ fig6](b ) ) parameterized by the energy",
    ".     vs. @xmath57 for @xmath135 showing a double - well potential .",
    "horizontal energy lines intersect the potential at the ( real ) classical turning points .",
    "( inset ) displays the same potential on a larger range of @xmath57 .",
    "( b ) loci of the classical turning points @xmath136 ( ref .",
    "equation  ) parameterized by @xmath35 taken along an axis perpendicular to the complex @xmath57 plane .",
    "[ fig6 ] ]    next , we discuss the lls supported by the effective potential . at the present moment the correct generalization of the atmm criterion for more than two classical turning points is not clear , which prevents us from obtaining the lls ( lying below the barrier top ) for the double well shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) .",
    "however , the interested reader is referred to the work of l. v. chebotarev on the ` extensions of the bohr ",
    "sommerfeld formula to double- well potentials'@xcite which , can be used to find the ( approximate ) lls for this case .    in the event of @xmath137 the effective potential ( in this case )",
    "offers a single well ( ref .",
    "[ fig7a ] ) with two classical turning points at @xmath138 .",
    "the lls in this case can be computed with our atm quantization criterion . using equation   we obtain the lls for this single well which",
    ", are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig7b ] for various values of @xmath29 .",
    "note that as @xmath29 increases , the minimum value ( bottom ) of the effective potential @xmath139 , also increases , hence the lowest landau levels increase in energy .",
    "in fact , the well depth , i.e. @xmath140 also increases with @xmath29 , unfolding higher lls . however , the rate of emergence of new lls becomes slower with increasing @xmath29 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7b ] inset .    before concluding , we discuss the effect of the fringing magnetic field pervading the region outside the strip , i.e.  @xmath115 . generally , with increasing distance from the ferromagnetic film , i.e. @xmath141 the fringing field can be neglected . however , the fringing field itself gave rise to many interesting effective potential shapes ( unlike in the previous example ) .",
    "particularly , in the preceding single well case with @xmath142 , we find that the effective well manifests in the interval @xmath143 , which lies outside the strip .",
    "this also gives a clue as to where the probability density of the electron is likely to be accumulated .",
    "in this paper we considered the problem of finding the bound state solutions of an infinite 2deg subjected to a perpendicular magnetic field that varies ( arbitrarily ) in one direction only .",
    "an exact criterion for the bound state energies or landau levels was developed using the analytic transfer matrix method ( atmm ) for the case when the effective magnetic potential allowed two ( real ) classical turning points .",
    "the extensions of the atmm for more than two turning points is not clear at the present moment and calls for further consideration . applying our formalism to a symmetric power law magnetic field led to the exact lls ,",
    "whose variation with the strip - width @xmath114 and field exponent @xmath102 were studied . in the sequel we looked at a 2deg placed under a ferromagnetic film , which is an experimentally realizable system .",
    "fortunately , this example could be tracked analytically to a great extent and the lls for a single ( effective ) well were obtained for various values of the @xmath3-momentum @xmath144 .",
    "this example also emphasized the role of the fringing field on the landau levels .",
