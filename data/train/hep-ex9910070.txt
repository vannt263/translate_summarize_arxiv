    "the both decays @xmath6 and @xmath7 give interference patterns in the energy dependences of the cross sections of the processes @xmath8 in the region of @xmath9 resonance .",
    "the interference amplitude is determined by the branching ratio of the corresponding decay .",
    "the table value of the branching ratio @xmath10 @xcite is based on the experiments in photoproduction @xcite . in @xmath2 collisions",
    "one can measure the leptonic branching ratio of @xmath9 meson @xmath11 .",
    "such measurements were performed in orsay @xcite and novosibirsk @xcite , but their accuracy was not too high .",
    "the experimental result on the decay @xmath7 @xcite does not agree well with the theoretical predictions ( see for example @xcite ) , but the improvement of the accuracy is needed .",
    "data collected at vepp-2 m @xcite with snd detector @xcite in the vicinity of @xmath9 resonance allow to improve the accuracy of the measurements of these decays .",
    "the result on the decay @xmath6 @xcite was obtained using 1996 data sample with the total integrated luminosity @xmath12  pb@xmath13 and corresponding number of @xmath9 mesons about @xmath14 .",
    "the 1998 data were used to measure the decay @xmath7 . during 1998 about @xmath15 @xmath9 mesons were produced with the integrated luminosity @xmath16  pb@xmath13 .",
    "the preliminary selections were the same for the both processes .",
    "the events with two collinear charged tracks were selected .",
    "the cuts on the angles of acollinearity in azimuth and polar directions were following : @xmath17 , @xmath18 . to suppress the beam and cosmic background the production point of charged particles",
    "was required to be within @xmath19  cm from the interaction point in the azimuth plane and @xmath20  cm along the beam direction ( the longitudinal size of the interaction region @xmath21 is about @xmath22  cm ) .",
    "the polar angles of the charged particles were limited in the range @xmath23 , corresponding to the acceptance angle of the outer system @xcite .",
    "the outer system allows to distinguish between the processes ( [ mumu ] ) and ( [ pipi ] ) due to the difference in the probability to hit the outer system for muons and pions .",
    "these probabilities are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : promu ] and [ fig : propi ] .            the data were divided for two samples ( `` muons '' and `` pions '' ) in dependence on the existence of the hit in the outer system .",
    "the admixture of the events of the process ( [ pipi ] ) in the sample `` muons '' was about 3% at @xmath9-resonance energy .",
    "the process ( [ mumu ] ) gave 15% contribution to the sample `` pions '' at the same energy .",
    "other sources of background are the cosmic muons and the process @xmath24 .",
    "the cosmic background was significant only for the process ( [ mumu ] ) and was suppressed by the time of flight system , which is a part of the outer system .",
    "the events of the process @xmath24 did not contribute to the sample `` muons '' due to the suppression by the outer system . to reduce the background from these events for the process ( [ pipi ] ) the procedure of @xmath25 separation based on the energy depositions in the calorimeter layers was used .",
    "the events of the process @xmath24 were suppressed by factor @xmath26 , while only 7% of the events of the process under study were lost .",
    "the remaining background from the process @xmath24 was about 1.5% at @xmath27  mev .",
    "the processes @xmath28 and @xmath29 gave resonance background to the process @xmath30 .",
    "the events of these decays were suppressed by restrictions on the energy depositions in the calorimeter layers .",
    "the contribution of the resonance background remained at the level of 0.5% at @xmath27  mev . because such background changes the visible interference pattern , special efforts were made to subtract it .",
    "the selected events were divided in two parts by the cut on the parameter @xmath31 : @xmath32 and @xmath33 . to obtain the interference parameters the events from the first part were used .",
    "the resonance background was determined from the second part , where its level is comparable with the visible cross section of the process ( [ pipi ] ) .",
    "the relationship between the quantities of the resonance background in two parts was calculated by monte carlo simulation @xcite .",
    "the detection efficiencies were obtained from the simulated data with using the experimental data for some corrections . the efficiencies for the processes ( [ mumu ] ) and ( [ pipi ] ) were 28% and 12% respectively at the region of @xmath9 resonance .",
    "the energy dependence of the visible cross sections of the processes under study was fitted with the following formula : @xmath34 , where @xmath35  the detection efficiency , @xmath36  the born cross section of the appropriate process , @xmath37  factor taking into account the radiative corrections @xcite , @xmath38 is the cross section of the background .",
    "the born cross section was factorized into non - resonant and resonant parts : + @xmath39 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41  modulus and phase of the interference amplitude , @xmath42  mass and width of @xmath9 meson .",
    "non - resonant cross section was taken in the form @xmath43 for the process ( [ mumu ] ) .",
    "a second order polynomial was used to describe the cross section @xmath44 of the process ( [ pipi ] ) .",
    "the interference amplitude is related to the branching ratio of the decay @xmath6 by the following expression : @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the fine structure constant . for the decay @xmath7 : @xmath47 , where @xmath48  the pion form factor at the maximum of @xmath9 resonance , @xmath49 .",

    "the systematic errors are not specified in these results . from here",
    "the leptonic branching ratio of @xmath9 meson @xmath56 and the branching ratios @xmath57 , @xmath58 were obtained .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the interference amplitude of the decay @xmath7 are following : @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",

    "there is a discrepancy between our result and the preliminary result of cmd-2 @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath67 is much lower than vdm prediction with standard @xmath68 mixing @xcite .",
