    "recent reports @xcite of stopping a near resonant laser pulse inside highly absorptive atomic vapors has attracted tremendous public interests .",
    "physically , this magic like ` light trapping ' is due to delicate quantum interference under the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite . in these experiments , a dynamical controlled pump field effects the conversion of a raman - matched probe field into atomic raman coherence of the medium .",
    "broadly interpreted , it provides a mechanism for storage of quantum information encoded in the probe field .",
    "the experimenters also demonstrated the read - out by back - converting stored atomic raman coherence into a new light field .",
    "eit typically occurs under conditions of complete opaqueness which prevents the propagation of incoherent light ; while a coherent propagation can succeed because of interference induced cancellation of one - path absorption . in several earlier experiments ,",
    "ultra slow light propagation was observed in bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of na atoms [ @xmath0 ( m / s)@xcite and @xmath1 ( m / s)@xcite ] , in hot rubidium vapor [ @xmath2 m / s @xcite and @xmath3 m / s @xcite ] , and in a pr : yso crystal [ @xmath4 m / s @xcite ] . as the net reduction of light speed is about the same order of magnitude in different host media",
    ", one may argue that being bose condensed is perhaps not so crucial . from a practical point of view",
    ", however , the long coherence time of bec does prove to be advantageous . compared with a homogeneous media @xcite , using a trapped atomic bec as the eit medium raises an important complication from its spatially inhomogeneous density profile ( due to both external trapping and atom - atom interaction ) @xcite .",
    "a consistent interpretation therefore requires careful spatial averaging and theoretical modeling . in this article",
    "we elucidate the effect of such a spatial average which also takes into account atom - atom interaction .",
    "slow light propagation can be phenomenologically understood in terms of a high index of refraction ( slow phase velocity ) or a high dispersion - like feature ( slow group velocity ) .",
    "it has been extensively studied for atomic media exhibit eit @xcite . under typical conditions ,",
    "such media are highly sought - after as there exist many potential technological applications , e.g. optical delay lines @xcite , quantum entanglement of slow photons @xcite , non - classical ( e.g. squeezed ) and entangled atomic ensembles @xcite , and quantum memories @xcite .",
    "other potential fundamental applications include : high nonlinear coupling between weak fields @xcite , quantum non - demolishing measurements and high precision spectroscopy @xcite , and as narrow - band sources for non - classical radiation @xcite .",
    "in addition to a complete stoppage of light @xcite , possibilities of even negative group velocities have been discussed @xcite .",
    "we expect our investigation will shed light onto the realization of these applications in addition to providing a satisfactory understanding of slow light propagation in trapped atomic bec .",

    "although this is a standard approximation , we cautiously point out that it may lead to significant errors near the boundary of an interacting atomic bec , where the gas density profile changes rapidly @xcite . in our numerical simulation",
    "we also neglected this term based on an additional argument . for a transverse field propagating along z - axis ,",
    "the coupling of @xmath8 is mainly along the orthogonal direction from the propagation direction .",
