    "in the conventional quark model , a baryon is a bound state of three more - or - less equivalent valence quarks .",
    "however , there are variants of the quark model in which interactions give rise to a quark - diquark structure for the baryon , where the binding of two of the quarks in the baryon is different from the bound state properties of the third quark . for a review of diquark phenomenology ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "one would like to understand the properties of diquark correlations ( if any ) directly from qcd . since this is a problem of the long distance behavior of the strong interactions , perturbation theory is not applicable .",
    "lattice qcd is a potential source of information about diquark structures , and the subject has been visited many times in lattice simulations @xcite .",
    "diquarks are not color singlets .",
    "many techniques have been used in lattice simulations to deal with this fact . in refs .",
    "@xcite , gauge dependent diquark correlators were calculated in a fixed gauge to study the masses of diquarks . in refs .",
    "@xcite gauge invariance was preserved by investigating the properties of states containing a static quark coupled gauge - invariantly to two light quarks .",
    "their quantum numbers combine to give the quantum numbers of the diquark .    whatever a diquark is , the environment it feels in a baryon with a heavy spectator quark is presumably different from that in a baryon with a third light quark . in this work ,",
    "we want to study diquark correlations in light baryons .",
    "the interaction between a diquark and a light quark probably depends on the spin of the diquark and this interaction can affect the formation of the diquark in the light baryon .",
    "here we combine a light quark with a diquark with a specific quantum number in the color anti - triplet representation to get a color singlet .",
    "this work addresses two questions : first , do baryon correlators involving light quarks show qualitative features associated with diquarks ?",
    "we attack this question using both quenched simulations and data from simulations with two flavors of light dynamical fermions . as the reader will see , we had to deal with a second , different question along the way : are the properties of baryon correlators affected by the presence of dynamical fermions ?",
    "the answer to that question is yes : with the simulation parameters we used , the quenched approximation is afflicted by artifacts which make it unsuitable to look for diquark effects .",
    "we look for diquark effects through the point to point correlator for baryonic currents , using the methodology first described by shuryak @xcite : we compare the correlator to its free - field value .",
    "if the ratio of the full correlator to its free field value exceeds unity , we say that the channel is attractive ; if it falls below unity we say that the channel is repulsive .",
    "an unphysical situation which is encountered in quenched simulations is that the ratio becomes negative .",
    "this indicates a violation of unitarity .",
    "we are interested in diquarks in the color anti - triplet representation since diquarks in the color sextet representation have much larger color electrostatic energy and thus are not favored by phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "the scalar diquark is often called a  good \" diquark since the two quarks are thought to be attractive to each other . the @xmath2 diquark is called a  bad \" diquark because all models suggest that it is heavier than the scalar diquark .",
    "besides these two diquarks , we also study the pseudoscalar diquark . in a quenched simulation , the point to point scalar meson correlator was found to be negative  @xcite .",
    "this behavior , and similar behavior for the scalar correlator in other situations , is known to be a quenching artifact . since quark - quark interactions resemble quark - antiquark interactions , we are curious to see if we will see similar quenching artifacts in the pseudoscalar diquark channel .",
    "excess zero modes of dirac operators at small quark masses are lattice artifacts in quenched lattice simulations . in a preliminary version of this work , reported in @xcite",
    ", we found that behavior of baryon correlators was strongly affected by zero modes . in the sector of our data which had no zero modes ,",
    "the difference among different baryon correlators was much smaller . in that study , we also had data from simulations with dynamical fermions , but they were performed in sectors of fixed topology and could not be applied directly to phenomenology",
    ". here we will give results from dynamical simulations in which topological charge is allowed to fluctuate .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ meth ] , we present our set up and simulation details . numerical results and discussions",
    "are given in section [ numres ] .",
    "then we conclude in section [ summ ] .",
    "our simulations are performed using overlap fermions .",
    "we have two data sets : one is quenched and the other is from a simulation with two degenerate flavors of light fermions .",
    "the simulations have many features in common , allowing for a reasonably straightforward comparison of results .    in both simulations",
    "the `` kernel '' ( nonchiral dirac operator @xmath3 inserted into the overlap operator @xmath4 ) contains nearest and next - nearest terms and a clover term set to its tree level value .",
    "the actual couplings are slightly different ; the action used in the quenched simulations is described in ref .",
    "@xcite while the dynamical action is given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "both simulations use gauge connections which were blocked over a hypercube .",
    "the quenched simulations employ the implementation of hasenfratz and knechtli @xcite while the dynamical simulations used the differentiable hypercubic link of hasenfratz , hoffmann , and schaefer @xcite . the choice of blocking parameters , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , in the conventions of ref .",
    "@xcite , are identical .",
    "these two blockings produce identical results in perturbation theory .",
    "our quenched data set has 40 configurations with lattice size @xmath8 and were generated using the wilson gauge action at a gauge coupling @xmath9 .",
    "the bare quark masses @xmath10 are 0.015 , 0.025 and 0.05 .",
    "the lattice spacing is @xmath11fm determined from the sommer parameter @xmath12 , assuming a nominal physical value of 0.5 fm .",
    "thus the lattices have a physical size of about 1.3 fm , and the quark masses are about 37 , 60 , and 120 mev .    the quenched simulations exhibit a typical quenched topological susceptibility .",
    "from the zero - mode spectrum , they have @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this corresponds to a scaled topological susceptibility of @xmath15 or @xmath16 mev)@xmath17 , not too different from recent high - statistics results @xcite .    in the two flavor dynamical simulation",
    "the lattice size is @xmath18 .",
    "we used a tadpole - improved lscher - weisz action with a coupling @xmath19 and performed simulations at three quark masses : @xmath20 , 0.05 and 0.10 .",
    "the sommer parameters are found to be @xmath21 at quark mass 0.03 , 3.49(4 ) at 0.05 and 3.39(3 ) at 0.10 .",
    "thus the lattice spacing is about 0.14 fm , the physical size of these lattices is @xmath22 fm , and the quark masses are 43 , 69 , and 133 mev .",
    "the pion masses in lattice units are 0.32 , 0.43 and 0.59 respectively .",
    "details of the simulations are found in ref .",
    "our measurements of the correlators are done on 60 to 80 configurations from these data sets .",
    "the topological susceptibility shows a dramatic variation with the quark mass , roughly consistent with the expected linear dependence @xmath23 .    a strength of our simulation is the use of a fermion with continuum - like chiral symmetry at finite lattice spacing .",
    "it will turn out that the correlation functions we measure have a fair amount of sensitivity to the underlying topology of the gauge configurations . simply counting the number of chiral zero modes",
    "gives us a robust measure of the topology .",
    "another strength is the use of full qcd with identical valence and sea quarks , rather than using simulations with different formulations of valence and sea quarks , or partially quenched simulations ( i.e. , with different valence and sea quark masses ) .",
    "this way we avoid a host of artifacts associated with the peculiar chiral properties of such formulations",
    ". the particular disease we want to avoid is associated with scalar correlators .",
    "this is best known in the situation of scalar mesons , where there is a long history of observations going back to the quenched studies of ref .",
    "basically , the scalar meson correlator includes a pi - eta - prime intermediate state . in",
    "quenched or partially quenched simulations , the flavor singlet pseudoscalar channel contains an unphysical double pole at finite lattice spacing .",
    "this intermediate state can dominate the correlation function ; removing it requires all the machinery of partially quenched chiral perturbation theory ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , plus the recent summaries of refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    in addition",
    ", zero modes of the dirac operator ( in sectors of nonzero topology ) make a negative contribution to the scalar correlator @xcite .",
    "this has been seen in point - to - point meson correlators in small volume @xcite .",
    "the current algebra description for scalar mesons is of course lacking for pseudoscalar combinations of two quarks , but the disease is still present .",
    "we will see negative correlation functions in our quenched data .",
    "they are expected to be absent in our full qcd simulations , and they will be .",
    "an obvious weakness of our study is that the simulation volume is small .",
    "we do not trust our measurements of baryon masses ; while we can use a combination of quark propagators which are periodic and antiperiodic in time to go to long temporal separations in the correlation function , the three - dimensional volumes probably squeeze the baryon wave functions , affecting their masses . in addition , as the quark mass falls to zero at fixed volume @xmath24 , at some point @xmath25 becomes order unity . at this point",
    ", the finite volume induces an effective restoration of chiral symmetry ; the condensate is pushed to zero .",
    "this so - called epsilon - regime is interesting in its own right , but can not be used to make direct connections to the properties of hadrons in infinite volume .",
    "clearly , any future simulation should be done with larger volume .",
    "the baryon currents and correlation functions we considered are collected in table  [ currenttab ] . here",
    "@xmath26 is the charge - conjugation operator .",
    ".currents and correlation functions [ cols=\"^,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ currenttab ]    both the current @xmath27 and @xmath28 contain a scalar (  good \" ) diquark . if the scalar diquark correlation is important in the correlators for both currents , we expect to see similar behavior in both correlators .",
    "the currents @xmath29 and @xmath30 contain a pseudoscalar diquark and an axial vector (  bad \" ) diquark respectively .",
    "under exchanges of all indices for space , dirac , flavor and color , diquark structures should be antisymmetric .",
    "since we are considering two quarks in the color anti - triplet representation , they are antisymmetric with respect to the color index . as for the space index ,",
    "they are symmetric .",
    "thus the symmetric property of @xmath31 ( @xmath32 , @xmath1 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) determines the symmetric properties of the diquarks under the exchange of the flavor index . for @xmath32 , @xmath1 and @xmath33 ,",
    "the diquark states are antisymmetric under the exchange of dirac indices .",
    "therefore they have to be flavor isoscalars . for @xmath35 ,",
    "the diquark state is a flavor isovector .",

    "@xcite , to reduce the sensitivity on quark masses of the free correlators , which we will use to normalize the interacting correlators , it is convenient to multiply the correlators with @xmath46 and take the trace in the dirac indices for all the currents .",

    "@xmath48 is used to normalize the interacting correlator @xmath49 , i.e. we will examine the ratio @xmath50 for each current . in our lattice simulations , we use the free lattice correlators @xmath48 , rather than an analytic formula , to do the normalization to reduce lattice artifacts .    because of the periodic boundary conditions in spatial directions , the correlators receive contributions from image points of the source , in addition to their  direct \" contribution .",
    "when computing the free correlator , we should only keep contributions , where the source points for the three quarks coincide , and so do the three sink points .",
    "they yield the infinite volume correlator as we want .",
    "the contributions from the cross terms are finite volume artifacts . in these cross terms , the three quark sources sit on different image points and the three sink points coincide .",
    "we expect that these cross terms affect the free and interacting correlators differently . for the quenched system , the cross terms do not contribute since they correspond to polyakov loops encircling the entire lattice and confinement forces their contributions to be zero .",
    "for the system with dynamical fermions , propagation of different quarks to different image points involves intermediate states in which the quarks separate a distance @xmath51 apart . presumably , these contributions are @xmath52 effects .",
    "however for the free theory , the cross terms give a nonzero contribution to the correlators , which is power law in @xmath51 , since there is no confinement .",
    "we can not eliminate the image contributions from the free propagator .",
    "however , we can suppress them .",
    "we do this via the method of ref  @xcite : the free overlap fermion propagators are calculated on a larger lattice ( @xmath53 ) than the lattices for the interacting simulations . then the correlators in the small volume are approximated as a sum of a term from the source and a term from the nearest image point .    on the lattice , correlation functions in the coordinate space for mesons , nucleon and @xmath54 were calculated in refs .",

    "based on our quenched results , we might have imagined a scenario in which the @xmath77 @xmath43 correlator was negative , but the correlator summed over all @xmath71 was positive , as required by unitarity .",
    "that does not seem to be what is going on .",
    "of course , the physics which is responsible for the probability of encountering a particular value of @xmath71 in an ensemble is almost certainly different in quenched and full qcd , so maybe it is not surprising that the correlation functions are different .",
    "we studied the point to point light baryon correlators for four currents using quenched and two flavor dynamical overlap simulations . as far as we know , this is the first test of point to point correlators for light baryons in full qcd . in these four currents ,",

    "these correlators are rather different in quenched approximation and in full qcd .",
    "the quenched @xmath27 correlator is more attractive than in full qcd , and the quenched @xmath43 correlator is negative at small quark mass .",

    "we are aware that in the instanton liquid model , baryon channels with different diquark quantum numbers show a strong response to the presence of topological zero modes @xcite",
    ". it might be , that quenched results could be a diagnostic for models even though they are not reliable indicators of the behavior of correlators in full qcd .",
    "the quark masses we are simulating are interesting ones because they go from a region where qualitatively speaking chiral symmetry effects are not so important ( @xmath78100 mev ) , to a region where they are probably important ( 30 - 40 mev ) .",
    "as our quark mass falls , the dynamical results show apparent changes in each correlator ( see fig .",

    "the @xmath27 correlator is the most attractive one , and the attraction in this channel rises strongly as the quark mass falls .",
    "an attraction appears in the correlator of @xmath43 at the lowest quark mass in the dynamical simulation . in the light - light - heavy system",
    "@xcite , the pseudoscalar diquark was shown to be heavier than the axial vector and scalar diquarks . here",
    "the attraction in the @xmath43 correlator is slightly stronger than in the @xmath28 and @xmath59 correlators .",
    "diquark effects in light baryons are apparently different from those in heavy baryons .",
    "the big difference between the @xmath28 and @xmath27 correlators is also a strong statement that diquark correlations are not a dominant factor in light baryons .",
    "both correlators contain scalar diquarks .",
    "the difference between these correlators is how the diquark couples to the third quark , and this coupling apparently matters : we are not seeing an isolated diquark .    finally , we have to conclude by again listing the shortcomings in this project : even our lightest quark masses are quite a bit heavier than the physical up and down quark masses .",
    "simulations at smaller quark mass will require larger volume to prevent an effective restoration of chiral symmetry as the quark mass is reduced .",
    "given the lattice artifacts we have seen in the quenched part of our study , we recommend against using mixed action or partially quenched simulations for these studies .",
