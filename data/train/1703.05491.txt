    "understanding the relative distribution of baryons and dark matter ( dm ) in galaxies is a key ingredient towards validating and constraining current galaxy evolution models .",
    "observationally , disentangling the contribution of luminous and dm at different radii has been most successful through analyzing the shape of observed rotation curves ( rcs ) , also used in conjunction with information from gravitational lensing ( see e.g. courteau et al .",
    "since the discovery of large rotation velocities in the outer disks of nearby spirals ( e.g. babcock 1939 ) , it has been confirmed that rotation curves of disk galaxies are flat in their outer parts beyond the peak reached at @xmath8 ( e.g. sofue & rubin 2001 and references therein ) , leading to a global picture in which disk galaxies are baryon dominated in their inner parts and dm dominated in their outer regions ( courteau & dutton 2015 , and references therein ) .",
    "efforts to quantify the dark matter contribution of galaxies on the scale of their optical disks have revealed that the baryonic fractions at fixed radius increase with stellar mass . while local low - mass late - type galaxies appear to be dominated by dark matter , massive local spirals like the milky way are baryon - dominated within their optical disks ( martinsson et al . 2013 ; bovy & rix 2013 ; barnab et al .",

    "spatially resolved kinematics of galaxies at the peak epoch of cosmic star formation density , @xmath9 , is now feasible with the advent of new integral - field - unit ( ifu ) spectrographs operating in the near infrared ( nir ) in the last decade .",

    "more recently , the multiplexing capabilities of the 24-ifu kmos instrument at the vlt ( sharples et al .",

    "these simulated rotation curves include a rotating exponential baryonic disk and a dark matter nfw halo for a range of sizes , masses and dark matter fractions .",
    "the simulated rotation curves are derived analogously to the method presented in section  [ models.sec ] , using a baryonic exponential disk with finite thickness , and nfw halo models . for the combined disk+halo mock - rcs",
    ", we vary the effective size of the disk , @xmath96 , and the disk - to - dark matter halo mass fraction inside the halo , @xmath7 .",
    "pressure support and adiabatic contraction are neglected .",
    "mock - rcs are created for a grid of @xmath96 ranging from 2 to 5 kpc , and for @xmath7 in the range of 1 ( no dark matter ) to 0.01 ( strongly dark matter dominated ) , adopting a total dynamical mass of @xmath280 .",
    "+ at each given grid point [ @xmath96,@xmath7 ] we create 25 observed - frame realizations of the rotation curve by applying a random inclination ( i.e. scaling the rc by @xmath282 ) and perturbation by typical uncertainties in velocity .",
    "furthermore , each realization is cut at a maximum galactocentric radius , @xmath69 , simulating that individual observed rcs are traceable to a limiting radius . since we found that @xmath69 is , among various galaxy parameters , most notably correlated with @xmath137 for detected and resolved galaxies within the dataset",
    ", we implement this dependence in our modeling .",
    "the  index @xmath87 of the disk is furthermore varied for each realization .",
    "the values of @xmath69 , @xmath87 , and the typical uncertainty in velocity for each realization are determined by randomly drawing from gaussian distributions .",
    "the mean and scatter of those distributions are determined from the observed sample of detected and resolved and sins / zc - sinf galaxies .",
    "then , each observed - frame rotation curve realization is convolved with a 1d gaussian psf of fwhm typical for our dataset , and the rc is sampled according to the pixel scale provided by the observed datacubes .",
    "then , we fit each of the simulated observed - frame rc - realizations with an exponential disk model as done with the real data , and we also apply the same selection ( i.e. criterion 2 ) to include galaxies for stacking . after selection , we average the noise - free theoretical rcs at a given [ @xmath96,@xmath7 ] according to their normalization , accounting for the typical fov limitations in our data .",
    "finally , we measure the outer slope on this average for a given [ @xmath96,@xmath7 ] within similar radii as done for the stacked rotation curve discussed in section  [ shape.sec ] .",
    "figure c1 plots a few observed - frame mock - rc examples , showing four realizations for different adopted @xmath7 , with an indication of whether or not a rc was rejected .",
    "as apparent from figure c1 , the outer slope of a simulated rc is strongly correlated with @xmath7 . in cases of strong dark matter dominance ( @xmath283 ) ,",
    "a strong outer flattening is still present in the outer observed mock - rc ( in cases where @xmath69 is sufficiently large ) , which can be reasonably well recovered by the exponential disk model shown in red .",
    "our simulations also show that the primary reason for a galaxy to be rejected is that its rotation curve can not be traced to sufficiently large radii ( i.e. @xmath69 is too small ) .",
    "+ to approach question 1 above we first examine the fraction of observed - frame mock - rcs we selected for stacking as a function of @xmath7 , displayed in the left panel of figure c2 .",
    "overall , the fraction of selected galaxies over the entire range of @xmath7 is @xmath284 and shows a mild trend with @xmath7 as indicated by the dashed line .",
    "the fraction of galaxies selected for stacking from the + sins / zc - sinf ao samples presented in section  [ stacking_sample.sec ] , is in rough agreement with the numbers found here .",
    "since we found that the variation of @xmath69 in the mock - rc realizations is the dominant factor for determining whether a galaxy gets rejected or not , we conclude that the main effect setting the selected fraction of galaxies for stacking out of the + sins / zc - sinf ao samples is the @xmath33 level ( setting @xmath69 ) and its variation among the data",
    ". however , as revealed by our analysis here , a mild trend of the selection fraction and @xmath7 remains , implying that dark matter poor galaxies will be preferentially selected .",
    "to test the effect arising from this trend on our results , we undertake the following exercise : + first we consider a large sample of galaxies with an underlying log - normal distribution of @xmath7 with 0.4 dex scatter and apply the selection function shown in the left panel of figure c2 to the distribution of @xmath7 . then we determine the resulting average @xmath7 by again randomly drawing from the distribution .",
    "we find that the resulting bias in @xmath7 is small , such that the selection function in figure c2 changes the average @xmath7 by @xmath285 at most over the entire range of @xmath7 values tested .",
    "although this test is simplistic , it indicates that even when rejecting a large number of galaxies for stacking , this does not bias the average @xmath7 of galaxies in the selected sample strongly .",
    "+ averaging over the entire range of @xmath7 , we find a positive correlation between the fraction of selected galaxies and @xmath96 , such that larger galaxies are more preferentially selected ( ranging from @xmath286 for @xmath287kpc to @xmath288 for @xmath289kpc ) .",
    "this trend results from the built - in correlation between @xmath69 and @xmath96 in our mock analysis here , and is furthermore in qualitative agreement with the bias towards larger galaxies for our stacking sample compared to the underlying + sins / zc - sinf ao samples .",
    "next , we turn to answering question 2 above by examining the outer slopes measured on our simulated mock rotation curves .",
    "the right panel of figure c2 displays the recovered outer slopes determined from the selected , normalized and averaged mock - rcs in the full grid of [ @xmath96,@xmath7 ] , shown as circles .",
    "in addition , the outer slopes determined from the noise - free rotation curves with a given [ @xmath96,@xmath7 ] are shown as dashed lines ( i.e. which have _ not _ been perturbed by noise , normalized , selected , and averaged ) .",
    "all slopes are shown in units of normalized coordinates @xmath4 and @xmath5 , as for the analysis of our results in section [ structure.sec ] .",
    "as expected , the theoretical outer slope of the mock - rcs is a strong function of @xmath7 , with a mild dependence on @xmath96 .",
    "the method of selecting , normalizing and averaging our mock - rcs can reproduce the outer slopes within the range in @xmath96 probed , most importantly even in the regime of rising rotation curves .",
    "the differences between the theoretical and recovered values are small , considering the uncertainty in the normalized slope of our stack ( @xmath290,@xmath145 $ ] ) .",
    "since the dashed lines represent all 25 realizations for a given [ @xmath96,@xmath7 ] , the difference between the circles and the dashed lines also encompasses the bias in slope due to selection of galaxies discussed above , further substantiating that this bias is small . + to investigate possible mass dependencies , we repeat our entire analysis changing the baryonic mass of the disk by @xmath291 0.5 dex and find that this does not influence our conclusions made here .",
    "+ although the analysis presented here is solely based on 1d - profiles and thus provides only a simplified view of our full stacking methodology , it demonstrates the robustness of our stacking technique and sample selection . with regard to question 1",
    ", our analysis reveals that the selection of our stacking sample out of the + sins / zc - sinf ao samples is unlikely to cause strong biases in @xmath7 .",
    "we find that the selection of galaxies for our stacking is mostly driven by the radius out to which individual rcs can be constrained , i.e. set by the @xmath33 ratio for a given galaxy .",
    "+ with regard to question 2 , our simulations show that our stacking technique is able to recover a wide range of outer slopes .",
    "although the model we use to normalize individual rcs intrinsically falls off in rotation velocity after the turn - over , we are still able to recover positive outer slopes and the large dark matter fractions they imply .",
