    "recently discovered iron - based superconductors@xcite induce great interest in scientific community because of rather high @xmath8 , proximity to the spin - density wave state and multiband nature of electronic transport.@xcite@xmath10@xcite however , these materials also encourage potential technical applications due to high upper critical fields @xmath11 and critical current densities @xmath12.@xcite@xmath10yang h    in the family of iron - based superconductors , fech ( ch = s , se , and te , fech-11 type ) materials have the simplest crystal structure , nearly isotropic high @xmath13 and rather high @xmath12,@xcite@xmath14@xcite but their relatively low @xmath8 impedes prospects for applications .",
    "superconducting @xmath8 was raised up to about 32 k in a@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 ( a = k , rb , cs , and tl , fech-122 type ) iron selenide superconductors with rather high @xmath13 ( @xmath4 56 t for @xmath15 at 1.6 k).@xcite@xmath14@xcite preliminary results indicate that the @xmath12 of k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 is much lower when compared to iron arsenides or binary fech-11 type iron selenides.karpinski@xmath14@xcite@xmath14@xcite@xmath14@xcite@xmath10@xcite post annealing and quenching treatment can induce metallic and superconducting state in as - grown and insulating k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 crystals,@xcite yet current carrying characteristics of such materials are not known .    in this work , we report on the significant enhancement of critical current density  in k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 single crystals obtained via post - annealing and quenching process .",
    "we also give detailed insight into the vortex pinning mechanism .",
    "main pinning sources are the 3d normal cores whereas dominant vortex interaction with pinning centers is via spatial variations in @xmath8 .",
    "details of crystal growth and structure characterization were reported elsewhere.@xcite the as - grown crystals were sealed into pyrex tube under vacuum ( @xmath4 10@xmath16 pa ) .",
    "the samples were annealed at 400 @xmath17c for 1h and quenched in the air as reported previously.@xcite .",
    "crystals were claved and cut into rectangular bars .",
    "magnetization measurements were performed in a quantum design magnetic property measurement system ( mpms - xl5 ) .",

    "calculated volume fractions from ac susceptibility at 1.8 k are rather similar , 75% for as grown and 88% for quenched crystal .",
    "however , the quenched crystal shows a very steep transition at 31 k and saturates at about 10 k whereas for as - grown sample the diamagnetic signal increases gradually with slightly lower @xmath8 ( fig .",

    "the pinning force is enhanced significantly and the bulk pinning is dominant when compared to the as - grown sample .",
    "the mhl of as - grown crystal is small and asymmetric , suggesting that the surface barrier may be important.@xcite@xmath14@xcite moreover , there is no fishtail effect up to 5 t  which has been observed in s - doped k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath21s@xmath1 single crystal with s = 0.99 at low field and in feas-122 single crystals at high field.@xcite@xmath14@xcite@xmath14@xcite@xmath10@xcite    the in - plane critical current density @xmath22 for a rectangularly - shaped crystal with dimension @xmath23 when @xmath15 is@xcite@xmath14@xcite    @xmath24    where a and b ( @xmath25 ) are the in - plane sample size in cm , @xmath26 is the difference between the magnetization values for increasing and decreasing field at a particular applied field value ( measured in emu/@xmath27 ) , and @xmath22 is the critical current density in a/@xmath7 . as shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , the calculated @xmath28 for quenched sample from fig .",
    "1(c ) is enhanced about 50 times when compared to as - grown sample .",
    "this can not be simply ascribed to the improvement of the superconducting volume fraction , because the volume fraction of quenched crystal is only about 4 times larger than the volume fraction of the as - grown crystal .",
    "critical current values in quenched crystal are higher than that in k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 crystals grown using the one - step technique and are the highest known @xmath0 among fech-122 type materials.@xcite the quenched sample also exhibits better performance at high field .",

    "the hysteresis area decreases with the temperature suggesting gradual decrease of @xmath0 as the temperature is increased ( fig .",

    "the dotted , dashed and solid lines show the @xmath40 , @xmath41 and the fitting result using @xmath42 , respectively ( see text ) .",
    "the measured and estimated @xmath36 are shown as closed and open circles in inset of ( a ) and ( b ) . ]    in order to explain the mechanism of flux pinning in quenched sample , we studied the temperature and field dependencies of the vortex pinning force @xmath43 .",
    "based on the dew - huges model,@xcite if there is a dominant pinning mechanism then the normalized vortex pinning forces @xmath44 from different measurement temperatures should overlap and a scaling law of the form @xmath45 will be observed .",
    "here @xmath33 is the reduced field @xmath46 and @xmath35 corresponds to the maximum pinning force .",
    "the irreversibility field @xmath47 is the magnetic field where @xmath48 extrapolates to zero .",
    "the indices @xmath49 and @xmath50 provide the information about the pinning mechanism . as shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) , the normalized curves of @xmath51 for @xmath52 @xmath53 22 k present a temperature independent scaling law . using the scaling function @xmath54 , we estimate @xmath49 = 0.86(1 ) and @xmath50 = 1.83(2 ) , respectively . the value of @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) @xmath57 0.32 is consistent with the peak positions ( @xmath58 0.33 ) of the experimental curves at different temperatures .",
    "those values are close to expected values for core normal point - like pinning ( @xmath49 = 1 , @xmath50 = 2 , and @xmath55 = 0.33).@xcite moreover , for @xmath52 @xmath59 20 k , the @xmath60 can be estimated by @xmath35 location at @xmath61 = 0.33 .",
    "partial @xmath51 curves measured between 10 and 20 k also exhibit the same scaling law , suggesting that core normal point - like pinning mechanism is dominant above 10 k. these point - like pinning center could come from the random distribution of fe vacancies after quenching , similar to feas-122 type materials.@xcite@xmath14@xcite@xmath14@xcite on the other hand , the @xmath35 obeys the @xmath62 scaling with @xmath63 1.67(1 ) ( inset of fig .",
    "3(a ) ) , close to the theoretical value ( @xmath64 = 2 ) for the core normal point - like pinning.@xcite moreover , as shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) , the temperature dependence of @xmath47 can be fitted by using @xmath65 where @xmath66 and we obtained @xmath67 = 1.21(1 ) , close to the characteristic value of 3d giant flux creep ( @xmath67 = 1.5).@xcite similar index has been observed in overdoped ba(fe@xmath68co@xmath1)@xmath3as@xmath3.@xcite    given the presence of 3d core pinning in quenched k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 single crystals , it is important to distinguish between the case of @xmath69 and @xmath70 pinnings . for type - ii superconductors ,",
    "vortices interact with pinning centers either via the spatial variations in the @xmath71 ( `` @xmath9 pinning '' ) or by scattering of charge carriers with reduced mean free path @xmath72 near defects ( `` @xmath70 pinning'').@xcite these two pinning types have different temperature dependence and therefore result in different relationship between @xmath73 and @xmath66 in the single vortex - pinning regime ( low - field and zero - field regions ) . for @xmath69 pinning , @xmath74 while for @xmath70 pinning , @xmath75.@xcite as shown in fig .",
    "3(c ) , the @xmath76 is between the two curves corresponding to @xmath9  and @xmath70 pinnings , respectively , but much closer and similar in shape to the @xmath9-pinning curve . using @xmath77 ,",
    "the experimental data can be fitted very well with @xmath78 = 0.74(2 ) , suggesting that both @xmath9  and @xmath70 pinnings play roles in the quenched k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 single crystals , but the former mechanism is dominant .",
    "it also implies that the main pinning centers lead to the distribution of @xmath8 in their vicinity or even might be non - superconducting like y@xmath3o@xmath79 and y - cu - o precipitates in yba@xmath3cu@xmath79o@xmath80 thin films.@xcite    even though the @xmath0 of quenched k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 single crystals is still one or two order(s ) smaller than that of other iron pnictide superconductors,@xcite@xmath14@xcite@xmath10prozorov post - annealing and quenching technique is an effective way to increase the @xmath0 of k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 .",
    "in summary , we report giant increase in the @xmath0 of k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 single crystals by post - annealing and quenching technique .",
    "we demonstrate that quenched k@xmath1fe@xmath2se@xmath3 crystals carry the highest observed @xmath0 among fech-122 type materials and exhibit good performance at high field .",
    "detailed analysis of vortex pinning mechanism points out to the presence of a 3d point - like normal core pinning in quenched samples .",
    "moreover , the analysis of temperature dependence of @xmath0 at zero field indicates that the @xmath9 pinning is dominant at measured temperature range .",
