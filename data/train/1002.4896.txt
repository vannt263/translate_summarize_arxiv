    "agn produce the powerful outflows of the electromagnetic radiation that in tunr can drive outflows of matter .",
    "these outflows and the central location of agn in their host galaxies imply that agn can play a key role in determining the physical conditions in the central region of the galaxy , the galaxy as a whole , and even intergalactic scales ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "outflows from agn are an important link between the central and outer parts of the galaxy because agn are powered by mass accretion onto a super massive black hole ( smbh ) .",
    "thus the smbh knows about the galaxy through the accretion flow whereas the galaxy knows about the smbh through the outflows powered by accretion . to quantify this connection ,",
    "let us express the radiation luminosity due to accretion as @xmath0 where we invoke the simplest assumption such that the luminosity is proportional to the mass accretion rate ( @xmath1 ) and a radiative ( or the rest - mass conversion ) efficiency ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "to estimate @xmath3 , one often adopts the analytic formula by @xcite who considered spherically symmetric accretion from a non - rotating polytropic gas with uniform density @xmath4 and sound speed @xmath5 at infinity . under these assumptions ,",

    "therefore , the momentum feedback efficiency ( @xmath17 ) is defined as the ratio of the total wind momentum @xmath18 to the total radiation momentum ( @xmath19 ) , i.e. , @xmath20    finally , the total energy feedback efficiency @xmath21 is defined as the ratio between the sum of the kinetic power ( kinetic energy flux ) @xmath22 and thermal energy power ( thermal energy flux ) @xmath23 and the accretion luminosity of the system @xmath24 ( eq .

    "in addition , these local and global processes were connected .",
    "however , all of this was possible at the cost of crude phenomenological realizations of some processes and the spatial resolution at a level larger than @xmath9 .",
    "consequently , the efficiencies were assumed instead of being computed .",
    "a main result of these simulations is that the famous @xmath29 relation ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) was reproduced .",
    "in addition , the bh mass is little affected by the details of star formation and supernova feedback .",
    "this is a great success of the current cosmological simulations models .",
    "however , as pointed out above ( see also others e.g. , @xcite ) the key feedback processes in the models represent `` subgrid '' physics .",
    "therefore , in these cosmological and galaxy merger simulations agn feedback can not be directly related to agn physics .    on the other hand , models that aim to provide insights to agn physics",
    "do not include galaxy but rather focus on @xmath9 or even smaller scales ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "thus they can not be directly related to agn feedback on large scales . however",
    ", these smaller scale simulations can be used directly to measure the feedback efficiencies and in turn to quantify the effects that are assumed or parametrized in large scale simulations .    here , we summarize the main findings from @xcite where we attempted to determine if agn can supply energy in the form and amount required by the cosmological and galaxy merger simulations . our approach was to measure @xmath1 , and various feedback efficiencies based on direct simulations of inflows and outflows in agn , on sub - parsec and parsec scales performed by @xcite ( kp09 hereafter ) .",
