    "shortly after the discovery that blazars can be strong sources of high energy @xmath0-rays , we suggested that very high energy @xmath0-ray beams from blazars can be used to measure the intergalactic infrared radiation field , since pair - production interactions of @xmath0-rays with intergalactic ir photons will attenuate the high - energy ends of blazar spectra ( stecker , de jager & salamon 1992 ) . in recent years , this concept has been used successfully to place upper limits on the the intergalactic ir field ( iirf ) ( stecker & de jager 1993 ; dwek & slavin 1994 ; stecker & de jager 1997 ; stanev & franceschini 1997 ; biller _ et al .",
    "determining the iirf , in turn , allows us to model the evolution of the galaxies which produce it . as energy thresholds are lowered in both existing and planned ground - based air cherenkov light detectors , cutoffs in the @xmath0-ray spectra of more distant blazars are expected , owing to extinction by the iirf .",
    "these can be used to explore the redshift dependence of the iirf .    on the other hand , by modelling the intergalactic infrared and optical radiation fields as a function of redshift , one can calculate the expected @xmath0-ray opacity as a function of redshift and comparison of predicted absorption with the data can yield important new information about the evolution of the iirf ( stecker & de jager 1998 ; salamon & stecker 1998 ) .",
    "exploring the iirf with high energy @xmath0-rays has both advantages and disadvantages over direct infrared observations .",
    "an important advantage is that since the absorption process only acts effectively in intergalactic space over large distances , the @xmath0-ray approach does not suffer from problems of subtraction of foreground emission from both zodiacal light and interstellar dust in the galaxy .",
    "as we have seen at this meeting , these can be formidable sources of uncertainty in determining the iirf .",
    "also , high energy @xmath0-ray observations of blazar and @xmath0-ray burst spectra at high redshifts can be used to probe the past evolution of the iirf whereas direct infrared observations can only tell us about the present iirf .    on the other hand ,",
    "the disadvantage of the @xmath0-ray approach is the uncertainty in the unabsorbed spectrum of the source .",
    "this uncertainty is somewhat ameliorated by the strong energy dependence of the absorption effect itself .",
    "therefore , it is my contention that using both direct infrared and high energy @xmath0-ray observations in a `` synoptic '' approach can yield the most information about the iirf .",
    "the formulae relevant to absorption calculations involving pair - production are given and discussed in stecker , de jager & salamon ( 1992 ) , where we derived the absorption formulae with cosmological and redshift effects included .",
    "for @xmath0-rays in the tev energy range , the pair - production cross section is maximized when the soft photon energy is in the infrared range : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the compton wavelength of the electron . for 15 tev @xmath0-rays",
    ", absorption will occur primarily by interactions with mid - infrared photons having a wavelength @xmath3 20@xmath4 m .",
    "( pair - production interactions actually take place with photons over a range of wavelengths around the optimal value as determined by the energy dependence of the cross section ; see eq . (",
    "if the emission spectrum of an extragalactic source extends beyond 20 tev , then the extragalactic infrared field should cut off the _ observed _ spectrum between @xmath5 gev and @xmath6 tev , depending on the redshift of the source ( stecker & de jager 1998 ; salamon & stecker 1998 ) .",
    "stecker & de jager ( 1998 ) ( hereafter sd98 ) have calculated the absorption coefficient of intergalactic space using a new , empirically based calculation of the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of intergalactic low energy photons by malkan & stecker ( 1998 ) ( hereafter ms98 ) obtained by integrating luminosity dependent infrared spectra of galaxies over their luminosity and redshift distributions . after giving their results on the @xmath0-ray optical depth as a function of energy and",

    ", they find that a comparison of their predictions with current _ iso _ galaxy counts at 15 and 175@xmath4 m favor their  baseline model \" with @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( the middle curve in figure 1 ) .",
    "the @xmath0-ray limits ( sd97 ) also favor @xmath34 .    on the other hand , the _ cobe - dirbe _",
    "far infrared determinations seem to favor a stronger evolution with @xmath35 up to @xmath36 .",
    "for example , the upper curve in figure 1 ( malkan & stecker 2000 ) assumes @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this curve gives a flux in the mid - infrared which is a factor of @xmath31.8 above the `` baseline model '' and would imply a corresponding increase in the opacity of the universe to multi - tev @xmath0-rays .",

    "that lorentz invariance may be broken , allowing the universe to be transparent to multi - tev photons ( coleman & glashow 1999 ; kifune 1999 ) .",
    "this `` new physics''scenario presents problems in that the mrk 501 spectrum does exhibit exactly the characteristics expected for high - energy @xmath0-ray absorption from pair - production ( konopelko _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) . however",
    ", we will discuss this possibility more quantitatively in the next section ( glashow & stecker 2000 ) .",
    "possibility ( a ) finds support in the independent analysis of the _ cobe _ data by lagache et al .",

    "if the far - infrared galaxy counts are incomplete ( possibility ( b ) ) , this would imply stronger evolution in the far - infrared emission of galaxies than in the mid - infrared .",
    "although the ms98 model already includes some differential evolution of this type , based on the data of spinoglio _ et al . _",
    "( 1995 ) , it is conceivable that starburst galaxies at redshifts at @xmath42 might produce an even higher ratio of @xmath43 m to @xmath44 m rest - frame fluxes than their present - day counterparts . radiation at these widely separated wavelengths is known to be emitted by quite different dust grains which could have different evolutionary development , particularly for ulirgs ( ultraluminous infrared galaxies ) and agn ( active galactic nuclei ) .",
    "one should note that _ this possibility can make the @xmath0-ray and infrared data compatible _",
    ", since absorption of @xmath3 15 tev @xmath0-rays is caused by interactions with mid - infrared ( @xmath3 20@xmath4 m ) photons and not 140@xmath4 m far - infrared photons .",
    "with the idea of spontaneous symmetry breaking in particle physics came the suggestion that lorentz invariance ( li ) might be weakly broken at high energies ( sato & tati 1972 ) .",
    "although no real quantum theory of gravity exists , it was suggested that li might be broken as a consequence of such a theory ( amelino - camilia _ et al .",
    "a simpler formulation for breaking li by a small first order perturbation in the electromagnetic lagrangian which leads to a renormalizable treatment has been given by coleman & glashow ( 1999 ) .",
    "the breaking of li at high energies is one way of avoiding the predicted , but unseen , `` gzk '' cutoff in the ultrahigh energy cosmic - ray spectrum owing to photomeson interactions with 2.7k cosmic background photons ( greisen 1966 ; zatsepin & kuzmin 1966 ) , which produces an effective absorption mean - free - path for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays in intergalactic space of @xmath45 mpc ( stecker 1968 ) .",
    "it has recently been suggested that li breaking could also make the universe transparent to high energy @xmath0-rays ( kifune 1999 ) .",
    "such li breaking implies a perferred frame of reference in the universe which would naturally be associated with a rest frame for the 2.7k cosmic background radiation .",
    "we follow here the formalism proposed by coleman & glashow ( 1999 ) for li breaking . within this scenario ,",
    "the maximum attainable velocity of an electron , @xmath46 , the velocity of the photon .",
    "let us consider the case where @xmath47 and we define    @xmath48    in this case , electrons above an energy @xmath49 will be superluminal",
    ". they will radiate cherenkov light if their velocity is large enough , _",
    "i.e. _ , if @xmath50 which implies that @xmath51^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this determines the maximum electron energy above which electrons would rapidly lose energy by cherenkov radiation :    @xmath52    ( in this section , we adopt the standard paticle physics convention @xmath53 . ) since electrons are seen in the cosmic radiation up to an energy @xmath3 1 tev , this implies that @xmath54 tev which gives an upper limit on @xmath55 of @xmath56 .    if li is broken so that @xmath57 , the threshold energy for the pair production process is altered because the square of the four - momentum becomes    @xmath58    where @xmath59 is the energy of the low energy ( infrared ) photon and @xmath60 is the angle between the two photons . the second term on the left - hand - side comes from the fact that @xmath61 .    for head - on collisions ( @xmath62 )",
    "the minimum low energy photon energy for pair production becomes    @xmath63    it follows that the condition for a significant increase in the energy threshold for pair production is    @xmath64    or , equivalently , @xmath55 must be greater than @xmath65 .",
    "thus , for a significant decrease in the optical depth to mrk 501 for @xmath66 tev , we must have @xmath67 .",
    "the effect of breaking li is to exclude photons of energy below @xmath68 from pair producing , thus reducing the number of target photons . in this way",
    ", one can exclude the high flux of far - infrared photons implied by the _ cobe - dirbe _ analysis from participating in the absorption process while still allowing mid - infrared photons to produce an absorption feature .",
    "one can rule out this hypothesis is if one observes electrons with energies @xmath69 1 tev .",
    "this would reduce the upper limit on @xmath55 to the point where there will be no significant reduction in absorption by pair - production interactions with infrared photons .",
    "on the other hand , if one observes @xmath0-rays above 100 tev from an extragalactic source , this would be strong evidence for li breaking .",
    "this is because the very large density ( @xmath3 400 @xmath70 ) of 3k cosmic microwave photons would otherwise absorb @xmath71 tev @xmath0-rays within a distance of @xmath3 10 kpc ( see eq .",
    ".    finally , we note that even if absorption is reduced in mrk 501 , one can still have absorption in sources at higher redshifts owing to interactions with higher energy photons ( see next section ) .",
    "we now discuss the absorption of 10 to 500 gev @xmath0-rays at high redshifts . in order to calculate such high - redshift absorption properly ,",
    "it is necessary to determine the spectral distribution of the intergalactic low energy photon background radiation as a function of redshift as realistically as possible out to frequncies beyond the lyman limit .",
    "this calculation , in turn , requires observationally based information on the evolution of the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of ir through uv starlight from galaxies , particularly at high redshifts .",
    "conversely , observations of high - energy cutoffs in the @xmath0-ray spectra of blazars as a function of redshift , which may enable one to separate out intergalactic absorption from redshift - independent cutoff effects , could add to our knowledge of galaxy formation and early galaxy evolution . in this regard",
    ", it should be noted that the study of blazar spectra in the 10 to 300 gev range is one of the primary goals of a next generation space - based @xmath0-ray telescope _ glast _",
    "( gamma - ray large area space telescope ) ( bloom 1996 ) as well as _",
    "veritas _ and other future ground based @xmath0-ray telescopes .",
    "salamon and stecker ( 1998 ) ( hereafter ss98 ) have calculated the @xmath0-ray opacity as a function of both energy and redshift for redshifts as high as 3 by taking account of the evolution of both the sed and emissivity of galaxies with redshift . in order to accomplish this",
    ", they adopted the recent analysis of fall _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) and also included the effects of metallicity evolution on galactic seds .",
    "their results indicate that the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background spectrum from blazars should steepen significantly above 20 gev , owing to extragalactic absorption .",
    "future observations of such a steepening would thus provide a test of the blazar origin hypothesis for the @xmath0-ray background radiation .",
    "pei and fall ( 1995 ) have devised a method for calculating stellar emissivity which bypasses the uncertainties associated with estimates of poorly defined luminosity distributions of evolving galaxies .",
    "the core idea of their approach is to relate the star formation rate directly to the evolution of the neutral gas density in damped lyman @xmath72 systems , and then to use stellar population synthesis models to estimate the mean co - moving stellar emissivity @xmath73 of the universe as a function of frequency @xmath74 and redshift @xmath75 .",
    "the ss98 calculation of stellar emissivity closely follows this elegant analysis , with minor modifications",
    ".    damped lyman @xmath72 systems are high - redshift clouds of gas whose neutral hydrogen surface density is large enough ( @xmath76 @xmath77 ) to generate saturated lyman @xmath72 absorption lines in the spectra of background quasars that happen to lie along and behind common lines of sight to these clouds .",
    "these gas systems are believed to be either precursors to galaxies or young galaxies themselves , since their neutral hydrogen ( hi ) surface densities are comparable to those of spiral galaxies today , and their co - moving number densities are consistent with those of present - day galaxies ( worthy 1986 ; pei & fall 1995 ) .",
    "it is in these systems that initial star formation presumably took place , so there is a relationship between the mass content of stars and of gas in these clouds ; if there is no infall or outflow of gas in these systems , the systems are `` closed '' , so that the formation of stars must be accompanied by a reduction in the neutral gas content . such a variation in the hi surface densities of lyman @xmath72 systems with redshift is seen , and is used by pei and fall ( 1995 ) to estimate the mean cosmological rate of star formation back to redshifts as large as @xmath78 .",
    "following fall , charlot & pei ( 1996 ) , ss98 used the bruzual - charlot model ( charlot & bruzual 1991 ; bruzual & charlot 1993 ) corresponding to a salpeter stellar initial mass function , @xmath79 , where @xmath80 .",
    "the mean co - moving emissivity @xmath81 was then obtained by convolving over time @xmath82 the specific luminosity with the mean co - moving mass rate of star formation .",
    "ss98 also obtained metallicity correction factors for stellar radiation at various wavelengths .",
    "increased metallicity gives a redder population spectrum ( worthy 1994 ; bertelli , _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ) .",
    "ss98 calculated stellar emissivity as a function of redshift at 0.28 @xmath4 m , 0.44 @xmath4 m , and 1.00 @xmath4 m , both with and without a metallicity correction .",
    "their results agree well with the emissivity obtained by the canada - french redshift survey ( lilly , _",
    "et al _ 1996 ) over the redshift range of the observations ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the stellar emissivity in the universe is found to peak at @xmath84 , dropping off steeply at lower reshifts and more slowly at higher redshifts .",
    "indeed , madau , pozzetti & dickinson ( 1998 ) have used observational data from the hubble deep field to show that metal production has a similar redshift distribution , such production being a direct measure of the star formation rate .",
