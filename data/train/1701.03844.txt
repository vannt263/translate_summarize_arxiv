    "<S> however , there is a serious physical problem in those works since scale - invariant power spectrums for the quantized cosmic scalar fluctuations can not be obtained , in disagreement with observational data . </S>",

    "<S> one of the purpose of this paper is to fill the gap by considering the gauge invariant cosmological perturbations in the hamiltonian reduction approach , without the above mentioned uv problem .    in this paper , we consider gauge invariant cosmological perturbations in uv - modified hoava gravity with one scalar matter field so that the scalar cosmological fluctuation can be also ( power - counting ) renormalizable with the dynamical critical exponent @xmath0 in four dimensions . by solving _ </S>",

    "<S> this could provide a new framework for the big bang cosmology .    </S>",
    "<S> now , several clarifying remarks are in order .    </S>",
    "<S> \\1 . </S>",
    "<S> _ on the constraint algebras and counting the number of degrees of freedom _ </S>",
    "<S> : for constrained systems , one can consider either the dirac s method without explicit solving the constraints or the hamiltonian reduction method when the constraints can be explicitly solved , or generally some combinations of these two . in the dirac s method , one </S>",
    "<S> can obtain the reduced phase space through the dirac bracketing with classification of constraints as first and second - class , primary constraints or their descendants , called secondary constraints dira . on the other hand , in the hamiltonian reduction method , </S>",
    "<S> the constrained variables are eliminated by solving the constraints , _ when applies _ , so that only un - constrained variables remain in the reduced systems fadd . in the later method </S>",
    "<S> , it is an important fact that the distinction between the first - class constraints and the second - class constraints is not necessary since the algebras between constraints are not needed . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that these two approaches are equivalent  classically \" ( see garc , for example ) , though quantum mechanically non - trivial . </S>",
    "<S> but the later approach is more efficient in identifying the unconstrained variables , when applies as in our case which will be discussed below in more details , without resorting the cumbersome classifications of the first or second class . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the perturbed systems , we need to be more careful about the constraint algebras since the more higher orders ( at least one - order higher ) than the primarily obtained perturbative constraints from a given order of the action or hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in our case of quadratic - order systems , one can obtain the first - order constraints , neglecting those of vector part which is trivial , as    c_a=0 ,  c_b_e=0 ,  c_r=0    but their constraint algebras produce the zero - th order quantities through poisson brackets . however , these are not enough to see whether the algebras are closed ( _ i.e. _ , producing already existing first - order constraints ) or not ( _ i.e. _ , having some residual terms which can not be expressed by the existing constraints ) , and this is the source of troubles in the constraint analysis of gong . </S>",
    "<S> actually , in gong , it is claimed that the constraints @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the second - class constraints corresponds to the secondary constraint @xmath134 in gong , after the constraint @xmath132 is used . ] and @xmath135 is the first - class constraint but this is a premature statement unless we get the first - order quantities through poisson brackets , which is not possible in the starting quadratic - order systems .    </S>",
    "<S> however , since counting the number of degrees of freedom through the standard formula ,    s=12 ( 2n-2 n_1-n_2 ) ,    where @xmath136 is the number of canonical variables , @xmath137 is the number of the first - class constraints , and @xmath138 is the number of the second - class constraints , produces @xmath139 , in agreement with the hamiltonian reduction method in this paper , either the naive estimation of gong could be confirmed even when considering the higher - order effects , or there is one more ( _ i.e. _ , fourth ) constraint which constitutes another second - class constraint with </S>",
    "<S> the used - to - be first - class constraint , @xmath135 so that @xmath140 . </S>",
    "<S> it would be a challenging problem to investigate the constraint algebras by considering cubic - order constraints . </S>",
    "<S> + 2 . </S>",
    "<S> _ on the well - defindness of gr limit _ : in the general decomposition of the metric , we start with four scalar degrees of freedom @xmath141 , and @xmath57 . the first three of them , @xmath141 are the lagrange multipliers which are eliminated by solving or imposing their associated constraints @xmath142 . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth of them @xmath57 is eliminated by solving the constraint ( [ eqr ] ) . in this way , all the scalar degrees of freedom in the metric are eliminated ( @xmath141 cases ) or absorbed ( @xmath57 case ) into the gauge - invariant scalar variable @xmath143 , which corresponds to mukhanov - sasaki variable mukh , sasa , so that the gauge transformation of the matter field @xmath51 is compensated by @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> it is remarkable that _ all _ the constraints can be easily solved in the general cosmological backgrounds with @xmath144 , which is quite unusual in the general context of gravity theory constraints .    on the other hand , even though the scalar part @xmath57 of the metric contributes to the gauge invariant variable @xmath58 , it is generated essentially by the scalar matter field through the coupling @xmath145 ; in other words , the quantum perturbations of the scalar degrees of freedom are essentially coming from scalar matter fields as in the standard cosmological perturbation theory in gr and this confirms the similar statement in the lagrangian approach with some appropriate gauge choices gao .    however , it is interesting to note that the _ static _ </S>",
    "<S> limit @xmath146 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , _ , flat minkowski vacuum limit is _ not _ well - defined unless @xmath147 by looking at the physical hamiltonian @xmath148 in ( [ phys h ] ) or its corresponding action @xmath149 in ( [ phys action2 ] ) . in particular </S>",
    "<S> , it is important to note that the purely gr limit of @xmath74 can be well - defined for arbitrary time - dependent backgrounds with @xmath150 : if one considers ( incorrect ) perturbations of a gravity system with matters around flat minkowski vacuum , there would be singularities which signal a wrong choice of the minkowski vacuum _ when matters present _ char .    as the last remark </S>",
    "<S> , the constraint @xmath132 in ( [ c_a ] ) , which corresponds to the  local \" hamiltonian constraint , is essential to recover gr , as we have seen above ( also in park:0910 ) , and this is from allowing the arbitrary , space - time dependent fluctuations of the lapse function @xmath151 . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to the , so called , projectable case with @xmath152 , where there is no local hamiltonian constraint but only its integrated form @xmath153 and recovering gr is not quite clear chen , as in the extended model koba , koh , ceri , cai . </S>"
