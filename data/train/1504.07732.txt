    "the power of theorem  [ thma ] arises from the fact that its condition can be tested using only a set of generators for the lie algebra @xmath7 , as those generators are sufficient to compute the commutant @xmath15 $ ] of the tensor square .",

    "one wants to decide effectively if the full lie algebra @xmath5 is generated without using the standard technique of computing the cumbersome lie closure for a given set of generators . with the help theorem  [ thma ] ,",
    "the question if a subalgebra of @xmath5 is a proper one can now be completely reduced to linear - algebra computations . the proof given in ref",
    ".   borrows heavily from the classification of alternating squares in dynkin s work@xcite and treats all cases individually .",
    "the motivation of the current work is to better understand the basic principles on which theorem  [ thma ] relies . in doing so , we identify the following generalization of theorem  [ thma ] where @xmath5 is substituted by an arbitrary compact , semisimple lie algebra @xmath2 and the standard representation of @xmath5 is replaced with an arbitrary finite - dimensional , faithful representation of @xmath2 .    b [ thmb ] given a subalgebra @xmath7 of a compact semisimple lie algebra @xmath2 and a finite - dimensional , faithful representation @xmath1 of @xmath2 , then @xmath19 iff @xmath20 ) = \\dim({\\mathfrak{com}}[\\phi \\otimes \\phi])$ ] .",
    "moreover , the proof of theorem  [ thmb ] does not rely on information from classifications and highlights general properties of restricted representations for compact , semisimple lie algebras and beyond .",
    "limitations on potential generalizations to arbitrary compact lie algebras will be discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "theorems [ thma ] and [ thmb ] can be naturally transferred to connected , compact semisimple lie groups , as their representations induce always a semisimple representation of the corresponding compact semisimple lie algebra .",
    "let us note , however , that the above theorems are not trivial consequences of the representation theory of general compact groups ; in particular , they do not hold for finite groups .",
    "we provide a counter - example for non - connected compact groups ( recall that finite groups are formally non - connected , zero - dimensional lie groups ) : consider the set @xmath21 of @xmath22 matrices .",
    "one can easily check that the matrices of @xmath23 form a group @xmath24 .",
    "as all generators in @xmath23 are contained in @xmath25 ( given in its standard representation ) , @xmath24 is a proper subgroup of @xmath25 .",
    "moreover , @xmath24 is given here in a particular unitary representation , is a double cover of the tetrahedral group , and is isomorphic to the special linear group @xmath26 of @xmath27-matrices with entries from the finite field @xmath28 and with determinant one . denoting the standard representation of @xmath25 by @xmath1 ,",
    "the described representation of @xmath24 will be naturally identified as @xmath29 .",
    "let us consider the tensor squares @xmath30 and @xmath31 which are defined as @xmath32 for elements @xmath33 of a group @xmath34 .",
    "one obtains that @xmath35)=2= \\dim({\\mathfrak{com}}[(\\phi\\otimes\\phi)])$ ] and shows that theorems [ thma ] and [ thmb ] can not be generalized to general compact groups which might not be connected .",
    "let us also note that finite subgroups @xmath24 of @xmath36 with the property that @xmath35)= \\dim({\\mathfrak{com}}[(\\phi\\otimes\\phi)])$ ] are known as _ group designs _ ( which are particular types of unitary 2-designs ) and have also been studied in the context of quantum information theory.@xcite    it is not unusual that limiting compact groups to connected ones leads to significant modifications from a representation - theoretic point of view . for example , it is well - known that there exist non - isomorphic compact groups with isomorphic representation rings.@xcite on the other hand , two _ connected _ compact groups can only have isomorphic representation rings if the corresponding groups are isomorphic.@xcite in the case of a connected semisimple ( complex ) lie group , it is even enough to determine the so - called _ dimension datum _ of a finite - dimensional , faithful representation  @xmath1 in order to fix its lie algebra.@xcite the dimension datum corresponds roughly to knowing all dimensions for representations occurring in any tensor power of @xmath1 . in this context , it is surprising that the conditions in theorems  [ thma ] and [ thmb ] rely only on the tensor square ( but admittedly for a weaker conclusion ) .",
    "finally , coquereaux and zuber@xcite proved properties for the sum of multiplicities in the decomposition of a tensor product of two irreducible representations of a simple lie algebra ( see appendix  [ cz ] ) , which also can not be generalized to the non - connected group case .",
    "we will assume that the reader has some familiarity with lie algebras and representations , which are both considered to be finite - dimensional throughout this work .",
    "all lie algebras are defined over the real or complex field , and all representations are matrix representations with complex matrix entries .",

    "our presentation will focus on compact lie algebras , although the parallel language of complex reductive lie algebras would be also suitable to state our results ( cf .",
    "appendix  [ app_pre ] ) ; and we will switch between them when necessary without further comment .    the article is organized as follows : we start in section  [ alt_sym_ten ] by summarizing a classification of representations with irreducible alternating and symmetric squares ; the corresponding details are given in appendices  [ dynkin_techniques ] and [ case - by - case ] .",
