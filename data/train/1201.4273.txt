    "in the fourth galactic quadrant , the direction toward @xmath22-@xmath23 galactic longitude corresponds to maxima in the thermal radio continuum , h i and co emissions @xcite .",
    "other kinds of tracers also indicate that in this direction the line of sight is tangential to a large segment of the carina arm . based on a multiwavelenght study of star - forming complexes , it is found that longitudes @xmath24-@xmath25 correspond to a tangential direction in both the 3- and 4-arm models of the grand design of the mw @xcite .",
    "the ob stars observed in the @xmath24-@xmath25 longitude range delineate a sharp outer edge of the carina arm at about 2 - 3 kpc from the sun @xcite . the field located between the associations in vela ( @xmath26 ) and car  ob1 ( @xmath27 )",
    "is not known to be dominated by any prominent ob association @xcite .",
    "the only known snr in the region is g279.0 + 1.1 @xcite .",
    "local and intermediate - scale features of the galactic disk , like arm - splitting and branching , are important part of the grand design of the milky way ( see @xcite for a recent discussion ) .",
    "this paper is focused on a field between @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the galactic disk with aim to address the present deficiency in the study of the structure toward the edge of the carina arm .",
    "our study is based on  photometric distances and provides new insights on the apparent groupings and layers in this region .",
    "the field under consideration is located between @xmath0 and @xmath1 galactic longitude and @xmath2 and @xmath3 galactic latitude . all",
    "data within this coordinate range was extracted from the catalog of @xcite and combined with the  photometry from the catalog of @xcite .",
    "the sample contains more than 300 stars of spectral types o to g with complete  photometry and is listed in table  1 , available only electronically .",
    "[ fig1 ] presents these stars plotted in galactic coordinates .",
    "all known open clusters and all  cluster candidates are shown as well and are listed in table  2 .",
    "to infer the physical stellar parameters from the photometry , the spectral and luminosity classifications ( mk ) were extracted from the simbad database and used in conjunction with the classification 1 vs. 1 diagram @xcite to study the spectral content of the sample .",
    "the sample contained about 40 a - f - g type stars of luminosity classes iii - ii - ib , which were clearly separated on the 1 vs. 1 diagram .",
    "since for these types a reliable estimate of distance is not available at present in the  system , they were excluded from the following analysis .",
    "the location of the rest of the stars on the classification 1 vs. 1 diagram shows a fair agreement with the simbad mk ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , top right panel ) .    the procedure applied here to obtain the color excesses and stellar distances for the o and b stars in the sample",
    "is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "the color excesses for lc iii , iv and v are obtained via crawford s ( 1978 ) calibration .",
    "the calibration by @xcite is used for lc ii , ib , iab and ia .",
    "we used r=3.2 and =/  0.74 to obtain @xmath11 .",
    "the calibration by @xcite is utilized for all o - b9 stars to derive the values .",
    "since we are dealing with early spectral types , the presence of emission lines in the stellar spectra is the largest source of error in the calculated absolute magnitudes .",
    "however , the @xmath28 vs. 0 diagram ( not shown here ) reveals that very few o and b stars in the sample deviate from the main sequence and have photometry affected by emission . for all stars with",
    "observed @xmath28 values outside the limits of the calibration , and all known emission - line stars , @xmath28 calculated from 0 was used to obtain ( cf . for details * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "note that this procedure yields distance in excellent agreement with the recalculated @xmath29 data @xcite .",
    "recently @xcite presented a comparison between the @xmath29 and photometric quantified as a function of the spectral sub - type in the b0-b9 range .",
    "this comparison was done for field stars with good - quality @xmath29 parallaxes that are subject to relative errors of less than 10% and shows that the agreement is in place over the entire b - type spectral range .    for the rest of the sample",
    "we follow @xcite and separate the a2-f2 stars from the f2-g2 stars according to their @xmath28 indices . all stars with @xmath28 in the range 2.55 to 2.7",
    "we refer to as f - type and all stars with @xmath28 between 2.7 and 2.9 we consider to be a - type .",
    "this photometric classification agrees very well with the simbad mk types . to derive the individual color excesses and absolute magnitude for these stellar types , we apply the calibrations of @xcite .",
    "the calibration of @xcite is applied to the a0-a2 stars in the sample , which photometric classification based on the 1 vs. 1 diagram is also in excellent agreement with the simbad mk types . the photometric data and the derived stellar parameters are summarized in table  1 which includes the stellar identifications , followed by the galactic coordinates , mk type and  photometric data , color excess and dereddened photometry , calculated absolute magnitude and true distance moduli .",
    "the expected uncertainties in @xmath30 are of the order of @xmath31 mag for o and b types of lc iii - v and for a - f v - iv types , and @xmath32 mag for b - type super - giants .",
    "an uncertainty of @xmath31 mag in @xmath30 propagates to an asymmetric error of @xmath33% to + 15% , and uncertainties of @xmath32 mag result in @xmath34% to + 26% error in the derived distances . since the photometry used in this paper comes from different sources , the homogeneity of the sample is an important issue .",
    "comparisons of existing data - sets collected by various authors for the field of carina spiral feature present in general a good agreement ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the latter authors estimated that the uncertainty in the calculated stellar distances due to possible systematic deviations in the existing photometric data should not exceed 35% .",
    "note , that in the system both the color excess and absolute magnitude calculations do not rely on a precise determination of spectral type , since the calculations are carried on in the same way for types from o to b9 , a0-a2 , a2-f2 , and f2-g2 . inspecting the reddening free 1 vs. 1 diagram is sufficient to identify and resolve spectral type misclassifications , but we did not notice any for our sample",
    ". however a great care was taken to resolve all cases of suspected luminosity class misclassification since different calibrations are used to calculate the color excesses for different lc types , which is especially important in the o - b9 spectral range . to ensure as proper an lc classification as possible ,",
    "the database was divided into groups according to the lc available in simbad and each group was considered separately .",
    "the reddening free 1 vs. 1 and @xmath35$]/@xmath28 diagrams ( not shown here ) built for each lc were used to examine for possible lc misclassifications and also for stars with h@xmath36 emission .",
    "the individual sources of spectral classification were also considered for all cases of observed inconsistencies , especially the catalogue of @xcite for ob stars and its updates .",
    "again , we did not notice inconsistencies between the lc types listed in simbad and the photometric classification diagrams we built and inspected , or other literature sources of luminosity classification involved in the comparisons .",
    "the diagrams color excess vs. distance moduli , @xmath11 vs. 0 and vs. 0 are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and are used to reveal spatially coherent structures in the studied longitude range .",
    "figures 3 , 4 and 5 show the stars with available distances plotted in galactic coordinates .",
    "the backgrounds in these figures present the distributions of @xmath37 , @xmath38co ( j=1@xmath390 , 115 ghz ) , and dust infrared emission , and are described in the captions of the figures .",
    "there is a number of papers devoted to star formation in dense ism in the surroundings of hii regions , both from theoretical and observational point of view ( see , for example , @xcite and the references therein ) .",
    "according to the current theories massive stars tend to stimulate star formation at larger distances , but affect destructively their immediate neighborhood , since they tend to disrupt the parental molecular cloud .",
    "it could be seen in figs .  4 and 5 that the location of the stars in the sample does not correlate with the dense molecular clouds represented by the distribution of the @xmath38co flux , and with zones of high reddening . on the other hand ,",
    "the stellar distribution correlates with the location of ionized hydrogen in fig .",
    "3 . studying the distributions of ob stars together with the distributions of @xmath37 ( a tracer of ionized hydrogen ) , @xmath38co ( a tracer for neutral hydrogen and molecular clouds ) , and dust infrared emission , could give more complete picture of the massive stellar population in the region , the different components of the ism , and the interactions among them .",
    "112 is a poor cluster candidate that contains about 10 ob stars .",

    "these stars form a very compact group at a ( median ) true dm = 11.06 ( @xmath400.28  sd ; @xmath400.12  se ) and average color excess = 0.5(@xmath400.07  sd ; @xmath400.03  se ) . for all groups under consideration in this paper we will indicate both the standard deviation ( sd ) and standard error ( se ) when providing distance modulus and color excess .",
    "when calculating the distance to the groups , the uncertainties will be based on the standard error in the distance modulus .",
    "our distance estimate of @xmath5 pc for  112 is significantly smaller than the presently adopted 2500 pc ( see for example webda database ) .",
    "the 2500 pc distance is based on the v vs. b - v diagram of the cluster @xcite . since all known possible members of  112 are found in the upper part of the ms ,",
    "a determination based on the location of these stars on the color - magnitude diagram is difficult .",
    "the photometry allows us to obtain the distance to each stars and find an average distance to the cluster .",
    "112 has been last studied by @xcite who performed ubv and photometry of stars in the carina - crux - centaurus - norma region suspected of belonging to poor open clusters or associations . however , the characteristics of these cluster candidates have not been photometrically studied based on photometry . the photometric diagrams and individual stellar distances presented here ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) indicate that one of these candidates ,  112 , is possibly a physical group . in our sample",
    "there are 9 other early b main - sequence stars located at that distance ( hd 84361 , hd 89174 ( both found at the edge of the studied field at galactic longitude approximately @xmath41 ) , hd 88661 , hd 90102 , hd 90273 , hd 90288ab , hd 90615 , cpd -54 3538 , cpd -55 3036 ) .",

    "the cluster has been previously studied by @xcite who found dm=12.0 ( 2500 pc ) and @xcite ( dm=11.65 ( for r=3 ) , corresponding to 2140 pc ) .",
    "the field considered in this paragraph clearly stands apart from the large hii features toward car ob1 ( @xmath42 car complex ) and contains several smaller but prominent hii nebulosities , among which rcw 48 and rcw 49 ( fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , top ) .",
    "this field is often called the `` preceding end of the carina complex '' ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "it is difficult to judge if the ob stars considered in this subsection are spatially connected to these hii regions , or are foreground .",

    "ic 2581 , at only about 2 - 2.5 kpc , seems to be located at the edge of rcw 49 , the angular distance between ic 2581 and wd  2 being about 25 arcmin .",
    "ic 2581 is considered of intermediate age and thus should not be involved in the bright nebulosity . however , this may not be true for the two brightest ob stars in the cluster , considered here .",
    "note that it is not certain that these two stars are actually members of the cluster . a loose constraint between 2 and 5 kpc of the distance",
    "to rcw 49 has been derived by @xcite from the mean x - ray luminosity of t - tauri stars .",
    "@xcite proposed 2.8 kpc based on nir magnitudes and colors of rcw  49 sources on the henyey track .",
    "for all stars considered in this subsection proper motions are available ( fig .  [ fig6 ] , bottom ) , and are similar for the majority of them .",
    "thus , based on distances and proper motions , we suggest a new ob association at coordinates @xmath43 , @xmath44 , connected to the compact  112 group and containing hd 90706 and hd 90707 ( probable members of ic 2581 ) .",

    "having in mind the independently obtained constraints and estimates of the distance to rcw  49 , it is difficult to judge whether this feature of ob stars is connected to the hii nebulosities seen in this direction or is foreground .",
    "hr car ( hd 90177 ) is a luminous blue variable known to undergo slow irregular spectrophotometric variations of about 1.5 mag over timescales of months @xcite .",
    "the most recent attempt to obtain the distance to hr car @xcite is based on the reddening - distance method of field stars and yields @xmath46 kpc .",
    "this estimate matches well the 5.4 kpc distance to the carina arm obtained kinematically @xcite .",
    "other existing distance estimates are based on the assumption that hr car belongs to the carina complex at the canonical distance of 2.5 kpc @xcite . however , the line of sight to the carina complex is tangential to the carina spiral arm , so the luminous stars seen in this direction may have a very large range in distance ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the @xmath29 distance obtained via the revised parallaxes @xcite is @xmath47 pc , thus locating the star much closer than any other estimate .",
    "we stress however that hr car lies in a relatively crowded region and this could affect the accuracy of the @xmath29 parallax .",
    "the visual magnitude of hr car in general varies between 7.6 and 8.6 mag @xcite .",
    "the measured @xmath48 indicates that the star is observed in emission and a @xmath28 index obtained via 0 should be used when calculating the absolute magnitude ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this yields = -8.3 mag .",
    "the emission usually does not affect the color excess calculation . here",
    "we adopt = 0.912 and a visual magnitude of 8.076 , which provides a distance modulus 12.37 , corresponding to 3 kpc ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this is the second most reddened star in our sample .",
    "we estimate @xmath49=3.96 mag ( for @xmath50=3.2 ) .",
    "hr car is variable both in photometry , spectral type and luminosity class .",
    "the available mkk classifications indicate spectral type from b2 to b9 and luminosity class i. since the 0 vs. 0 relations used for reddening determination are identical for lc i - ii near to the upper part of the ms @xcite , a variable luminosity class should not influence the obtained color excess . as previously mentioned , both color excess and determination do not depend of the spectral subtype . in this sense",
    ", the variability in spectral classification of hr car should not influence the obtained distance .",
    "the distance and absolute magnitude of hr car are important for a variety of reasons , like the theoretical interpretation of this stellar type @xcite , studying the spatial distribution of dust around the star @xcite , etc .",
    "apparently an ambiguity in both estimates is still present .",
    "however , despite of the peculiarity of this star , our method based of photometry provides reasonable estimates of both quantities and indicates that the currently accepted distance of 5 kpc is overestimated and should be applied with caution . on the other hand ,",

    "these authors have detected two large shells in the interstellar neutral hydrogen near the carina tangent , centered at ( @xmath54)=(277,0 ) and ( @xmath54)=(280,0 ) that share a common line of sight .",
    "the center velocities are @xmath5536 km s@xmath53 and @xmath5559 km s@xmath53 , which puts the shells at kinematic distances of 6.5@xmath56 kpc and at 10 kpc , respectively .",
    "gsh 277 + 00 + 36 can be classified as a supershell on the basis of its large size and expansion energy .",
    "the above authors find evidence for molecular clouds along the supershell s edges , indicating that a star formation may have been initiated by the supershell s expansion .",
    "they suggest that the prior interpretation of this large void as an interarm region is inappropriate on the basis of the supershell s chimney and shell - like morphology .",

    "the average distance moduli are shown at the bottom of table  3 , together with the mean error , and correspond to distances of 6700 pc , 3090 pc and 1432 pc , respectively . since",
    "the toward wd  2 is more than 5 mag , one could expect an abnormal value of r , but , as mentioned by @xcite , the present photometric data does not allow us to evaluate the reddening law toward wd  2 .",
    "another way to test our distance estimate is to obtain 0 from 0 and plot the wd  2 stars on the vs 0 diagram . to do this the study of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* his fig .",
    "7 ) on the o - type stars was used .",
    "the average 0 and values for the 12 stars are @xmath77 and @xmath78 mag ( obtained via the calibration of @xcite ) , respectively , providing a good agreement with the location of the ms on fig .",
    "2 , where the values are obtained via the calibration of @xcite .",
    "this points out that both and 0 obtained from the @xcite calibration for the wd  2 stars are in agreement with the parameters provided by the photometry .",
    "thus , utilizing r=3.2 , we provide a new photometric distance to wd  2 of @xmath9 pc .",
    "the accurate and deep @xmath79 ccd photometry by @xcite provides a distance of @xmath80 kpc , also in excellent agreement with the one of 6.7 kpc derived here .",
    "however , an investigation of the value of r is clearly warranted in order to pinpoint the exact distance to the cluster .    in their study ,",
    "rauw et al .",
    "have used the new calibration for o - type stars by @xcite . in order to closely evaluate both calibrations , we used the database of @xcite and calculated color excess and absolute magnitude for all 273 stars with photometry",
    ". then we obtained these parameters via the calibrations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the comparisons led to the following results .",
    "for lc v ( 96 stars ) @xcite provides dm practically identical with the ones , while @xcite seem to slightly underestimate the dm by 0.25@xmath81 . for lc iii ( 44 stars )",
    "@xcite provides dm practically identical with the ones , while @xcite seem to underestimate the dm by 0.29@xmath82 . in the wd 2 sample , seven of the stars",
    "are of lc v and 5 stars are lc iii .",
    "the calibration of @xcite provides dm=14.095@xmath83 for the 7 lc v stars and dm=14.18@xmath84 for the 5 lc iii stars . for the same sample the calibration of @xcite provides dm=14.08@xmath85 for lc v and dm=14.72@xmath86 for lc iii .",
    "it seems that in this particular case the @xcite calibration provides more consistency between lc v and lc iii .",
    "overall this is an acceptable difference in the average dm which yields to 6.7 kpc using @xcite and 7.4 kpc if @xcite is utilized .",
    "all of the above calculations are for r=3.2 . in their study",
    "@xcite use r=3.1 , which , since the reddening of wd 2 is quite high , results in a distance of 8 kpc .",
    "all this points out that our result is actually consistent with that of @xcite and the discrepancy is mostly due to the utilized value of r.    figure 7 presents the plots of dm vs. galactic longitude and galactic latitude for all stars of this sample with calculated distances .",
    "the clusters and cluster candidates are shown , together with the gmc from the study of @xcite .",
    "for the clusters studied here we use the new estimates and utilize the distances listed in table 2 for the rest of the clusters .",
    "the edge of the carina arm based on the distribution of the bright ob stars @xcite is indicated with a solid line .",
    "the distances to gmc  3 and gmc  7 are optical , all other gmc distances are kinematic ( see @xcite ) .",
    "any distance larger than 3.5 kpc would place wd  2 beyond the edge of the carina arm , but a large distance is in agreement with the location of the edge of the arm delineated by the gmc .",
    "there is an excellent agreement between the newly obtained distance of 6.7 kpc to wd  2 and the kinematic distance of gmc  8 .",
    "we present a photometric investigation of a number of clusters and cluster candidates and field stars located in the galactic plane toward the tangent of the carina arm . based on the derived homogeneous distances and color excesses of more than 260 stars of spectral types o to g",
    ", we provide revised distances for the stellar groups and layers present in this sample .",
    "the main findings are as follows :    \\1 .",
    "the cluster candidate  112 seems to be a physical group at @xmath87 pc .",
    "we found other ob stars with similar proper motions at that same distance , and suggest a new ob association at coordinates @xmath88 , @xmath7 .",
    "this feature appears connected to  112 and containing at least the two brightest ob stars of ic 2581 .",
    "it is located at @xmath45 pc and probably related to the hii nebulosities seen in this direction .",
    "the following parameters are obtained for the luminous blue variable hr car : = -8.3 , @xmath49=3.96 mag ( for @xmath50=3.2 ) and a distance of 3 kpc ( adopting a visual magnitude of 8.076 ) .",
    "the currently accepted distance of 5 kpc to this star seems overestimated .",
    "the high interstellar extinction toward cpd @xmath1055 3036 (= 5.36 mag ) and its proximity to rcw 45 in terms of galactic coordinates may indicate a possible relation to the nebula .",
    "the star is located at 1101 pc photometric distance .",
    "the distance of @xmath89 pc to the open cluster  46 is in a good agreement with the currently accepted value .",
    "however , one can notice that the photometric distances obtained here show somehow a spread larger than expected for a nearby cluster .",
    "this does not necessary mean a doubtful nature for this cluster and can be due to the fact that the stars in  46 are of spectral types a0-a2 and the system may not provide accurate stellar parameters for this spectral range .    \\5 .",
    "based on 61 b - type stars with available photometry in ngc 3293 we find a distance of 2691 pc .",
    "although a fair agreement exists between our estimate and the most recently published distances , our result locates this cluster some 250 pc farther than currently accepted .",
    "\\7 . utilizing bv photometry and spectral classification of the known o - type stars in wd  2",
    ", we provide a new distance estimate of @xmath9 pc , in excellent agreement with recent distance determination to the giant molecular structures in this direction .",
    "this estimate does not contradict with the 8-kpc distance provided by @xcite as the difference is due to a large extent to the utilized value of r.    this work is supported by the national science foundation grant ast-0708950 and an university of wisconsin oshkosh faculty development award . n.k .",
