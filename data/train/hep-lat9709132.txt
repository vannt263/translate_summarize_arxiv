    "the project which we initiated eighteen months ago to study the gluon excitations of the qcd vacuum in the presence of a static quark - antiquark source has two distinct goals .",
    "our first objective was to determine the spectrum of hybrid @xmath1 and @xmath2 states with results reported in ref .",
    "early predictions of these states in the born - oppenheimer approximation were based on the bag picture of the qcd vacuum in ref .",
    "@xcite , and additional phenomenological observations were made in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the investigation of gluon excitations around a static quark - antiquark pair in the qcd vacuum has important implications on our conceptual understanding of the quark confinement mechanism about which very little is known at the present . in this talk",
    "we will address this second goal within the context of a simplified picture of the qcd vacuum which in the first tests appears to agree surprisingly well with simulation results .",
    "there is little doubt that some sort of a bag is formed when a static @xmath0 pair is inserted in the physical vacuum at a separation @xmath3 where asymptotic freedom holds .",
    "the strong chromoelectric dipole field , @xmath4 , at a distance @xmath5 from the dipole source , suppresses the microscopic nonperturbative condensate before the field strength drops to some typical confinement scale @xmath6 at a distance @xmath7 which we will identify qualitatively as the bag radius of confinement ( g(r ) is the coupling constant , or color charge ) . at the confinement scale ,",
    "the perturbative vacuum bubble which is sustained by the strong dipole field has to be replaced by the nonperturbative condensate of the physical vacuum . within the bubble ( bag )",
    "we should be able to apply perturbation theory for gluonic corrections to the dipole field to recover the running coulomb law .",
    "the size of the bubble @xmath7 can be estimated from the relation @xmath8 .    in the bag model , as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite , we assume a simple confinement picture for the interface between the two phases of the vacuum . inside the bag the chromoelectric vacuum permeability @xmath9",
    "is set to one ( perturbative vacuum ) . in the confining gluon condensate of the physical vacuum @xmath10",
    "is assumed ( diaelectric vacuum ) which is expected to emerge from the microscopic theory of a dual nonabelian superconductor in qcd .",
    "a sharp boundary is assumed to separate the bag from the physical vacuum with surface energy @xmath11 per unit area and volume energy b per unit volume .",
    "the value of b is related to the gluon vacuum condensate by the relation @xmath12  @xcite . based on qcd sum rules and heavy @xmath0 spectroscopy ,",
    "the value of b is determined to be in the range @xmath13  @xcite .",
    "the interface energy at the deconfining transition temperature of quenched qcd has been determined in the @xmath14 range  @xcite which is small in comparison with the volume energy and neglected in the calculations we present .",
    "the adiabatic method we apply here is a variational principle for the total energy of the bag ( for details we refer to refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite ) . in the results we present here",
    "an ellipsoidal shape is used in the variational calculations which is adequate within a few percent accuracy . with an effective coupling constant @xmath15 inside the bag , and with the choice of b given in fig .",
    "[ fig : x1 ] , we first solve the bag equations in coulomb gauge for the ground state when dynamical gluons are not excited .",
    "the variation of the minimal bag shape as a function of the @xmath0 separation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : x1 ] .",
    "= 2.5 in    -7 mm    various bag shapes in the presence of gluon excitations are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : x3 ] .",
    "the notation for the gluon quantum numbers is explained in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the bag model in the adiabatic approximation predicts the gluon excitations without free parameters .",
    "[ fig : bag1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : bag2 ] compare the bag model predictions with our simulation results .",
    "the agreements are quite remarkable .",
    "= 1.9 in    -7 mm    = 2.9 in    = 2.9 in",
    "in the adiabatic approximation there is an exact vortex solution to the bag equations which describes a homogeneous chromoelectric flux with an intrinsic radius @xmath16 , where @xmath15 and b are the only two parameters of the model .",
    "the vortex energy per unit length ( string tension , or slope of the linear part of the @xmath0 potential ) is given by @xmath17 .",
    "the vortex limit is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : x2 ] . as it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite this vortex has massive intrinsic gluon excitations along the  waveguide \" of the vortex and collective string excitations which correspond to the low energy goldstone modes of the soliton  @xcite .",
    "the bag model provides a first attempt for a unified low energy effective theory to capture the physics of quark confinement at small _ and _ large @xmath0 separations .",
    "effective string models focus on the long range part of the picture  @xcite .",
    "it remains a challenge to understand the more detailed connection between the two approaches ."
