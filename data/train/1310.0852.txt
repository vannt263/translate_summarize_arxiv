    "ronnie brown said it best when declaring ,  one of the irritations of group theory is that the set hom(@xmath3,@xmath4 ) of homomorphisms between groups @xmath3 and @xmath4 does not have a natural group structure .",
    "\" of course , when @xmath3 and @xmath4 are both commutative , we know that hom(@xmath3 , @xmath4 ) is also a commutative group . since quandles are algebraic structures having groups as their primordial example , it is natural to wonder when , if ever , the set of quandle homomorphisms from a quandle @xmath5 to a quandle @xmath6 , @xmath7 , possesses additional structure .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that if @xmath8 is the fundamental quandle of a knot and @xmath5 is an alexander quandle , the set @xmath9 has an alexander quandle structure .",
    "we generalize this result to show that the set @xmath9 has a quandle structure provided the target quandle @xmath5 is an ` abelian ' , or ` medial ' , quandle",
    ". moreover , for links with two or more components , the resulting quandle structure is not determined by the cardinality of the target quandle and is thus a stronger invariant than the counting invariant @xmath10 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ qb ]",
    "we recall the basics of quandles , including definitions and examples . in section [ aq ]",
    "we turn our focus to the case of abelian quandles , also called medial quandles .",
    "then , in section [ hq ] , specifically in proposition [ p : main ] , we define a natural quandle structure on the set of quandle homomorphisms from an arbitrary quandle to a finite abelian quandle .",
    "we continue in this section by illustrating properties of the hom quandle , ( @xmath1,@xmath0 ) , including those inherited from the quandle @xmath0 . in section [ hqe ]",
    "we apply the results of section [ hq ] to define an enhanced invariant of links associated to finite abelian quandles and in section [ bq ] we generalize the results of previous sections to the case of biquandles . in section [ c ]",
    "we consider the category of abelian quandles and show that it is symmetric monoidal closed , and we conclude in section [ q ] with some questions for future work .",
    "we thank tom leinster for insightful and helpful discussions related to section [ c ] and james mccarron for pointing out an error in the initially posted version .",
    "we are also grateful for useful conversations with lou kauffman and david radford when this work was in the beginning stages .",
    "we begin with a definition from @xcite .",
    "the quandle axioms capture the essential properties of group conjugation , and correspond to the reidemeister moves on oriented link diagrams with elements corresponding to arcs and the quandle operation @xmath11 corresponding to crossings with @xmath12 the result of @xmath13 crossing under @xmath14 from right to left . in particular , the operation is distinctly non - symmetrical  in @xmath12 , @xmath14 is acting on @xmath13 and not conversely  and thus it makes sense to use a non - symmetrical symbol like @xmath11 .",
    "axiom ( i ) says that every element of @xmath5 is idempotent under @xmath11 .",
    "axiom ( ii ) says that the action of @xmath14 on @xmath5 defined by @xmath15 is bijective for every @xmath16 .",
    "hence there are inverse actions , denoted by @xmath17 , and axiom ( ii ) is equivalent to    there is an _",
    "inverse _ , or _ dual _ , operation @xmath18 satisfying for all @xmath19 @xmath20    thus , we can eliminate the existential quantifier in axiom ( ii ) at the cost of adding a second operation .",
    "it is a straightforward exercise to show that the inverse operation is also idempotent and self - distributive , so @xmath5 is a quandle under @xmath21 , known as the _ dual quandle _ of @xmath22 .",
    "one can also show that the two triangle operations distribute over each other , i.e. we have @xmath23    axiom ( iii ) says that the quandle operation is self - distributive .",
    "this axiom then implies that the action maps @xmath24 are endomorphisms of the quandle structure : @xmath25 indeed , axioms ( ii ) and ( iii ) together say that the action of any element @xmath16 is always an automorphism of @xmath5 .",
    "if @xmath22 satisfies only ( ii ) and ( iii ) , then @xmath5 is called a _ rack _ or _",
    "automorphic set _",
    "; a quandle is then a rack in which every element is a fixed point of its own action .",
    "a quandle is _ involutory _ if @xmath26 , i.e. if for all @xmath13 and @xmath14 in @xmath5 we have @xmath27 .",
    "involutory quandles are also known as _ kei _ or    utf8min    ; see @xcite for more details .",
    "@xmath28    @xmath29    as briefly mentioned already , the quandle axioms can be understood as arising from the oriented reidemeister moves where quandle elements are associated to arcs in a knot or link diagram and the quandle operation @xmath12 is interpreted as arc @xmath13 crossing under arc @xmath14 from the right .",
    "we note that the orientation of the undercrossing arc is not relevant , but only the orientation of the overcrossing arc .",
    "the inverse triangle operation from axiom ( ii@xmath30 ) can be interpreted as the understrand crossing backwards from left to right as illustrated below : @xmath31    then the quandle axioms are exactly the conditions required for the diagrams to match up one - to - one before and after the reidemeister moves .",
    "@xmath32 @xmath33    given an oriented knot or link @xmath4 , the _ knot quandle _",
    ", denoted @xmath8 , is the quandle with generators corresponding to arcs in a diagram of @xmath4 and relations given by the crossings .",
    "more precisely , the elements of the knot quandle are equivalence classes of quandle words in the generators under the equivalence relation generated by the crossing relations and the quandle axioms",
    ".    we will find it convenient to specify quandle structures on a finite sets @xmath34 using an @xmath35 matrix encoding the quandle operation table .",
    "in particular , the entry in row @xmath36 column @xmath37 of the quandle matrix is @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "then , for example , the alexander quandle structure on @xmath40 ( we use 3 for the class of zero so we can number our rows and columns starting with 1 ) with quandle operation @xmath41 has matrix @xmath42.\\ ] ]    given a knot @xmath4 and a finite quandle @xmath5 , the cardinaility of the set of quandle homomorphisms ( maps @xmath43 such that @xmath44 ) is a computable knot invariant known as the _ quandle counting invariant_. a quandle homomorphism @xmath43 corresponds to a labeling of the arcs in a diagram of @xmath4 with elements of @xmath5 such that the crossing relations are all satisfied .",
    "for instance , the trefoil knot @xmath45 has nine colorings by the quandle structure on @xmath46 listed above , as shown below : @xmath47 hence , the quandle counting invariant here is @xmath48 .",
    "we now turn our attention to a special class of quandles known as ` abelian ' quandles . the reader should be aware that , unlike in the group case , the adjective  abelian \" is not synonymous with  commutative . \"",
    "abelian quandles satisfy the condition below whereas commutative quandles satisfy @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath50    @xmath51    if @xmath1 is an alexander quandle containing an element @xmath52 which acts trivially on @xmath1 , i.e. if @xmath53 for all @xmath54 , then @xmath1 is isomorphic to the trivial quandle on @xmath55 elements .",
    "suppose @xmath14 acts trivially on @xmath1 , so that @xmath56 for all @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath57 for all @xmath54 .",
    "in particular , since every @xmath54 has the form @xmath58 , the map @xmath59 is the zero map , so @xmath60 is the identity map .",
    "then @xmath61 and the quandle operation on @xmath1 is trivial .",
    "in addition to right - distributivity , the operation in an abelian quandle is left - distributive .",
    "if @xmath0 is an abelian quandle , then for all @xmath62 we have @xmath63",
    "we now wish to study the structure of the set of quandle homomorphisms @xmath2 where @xmath1 is any quandle and @xmath0 is an abelian quandle .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath0 be quandles . if @xmath0 is abelian , then the set of quandle homomorphisms @xmath2 is a quandle under the pointwise operation @xmath64 .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 is abelian .    for axiom ( i )",
    ", we have @xmath65    for axiom ( ii ) , define @xmath66 in @xmath0 . then we have @xmath67    for axiom ( iii ) , we have @xmath68(q).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to show that @xmath2 is abelian , let @xmath69 . then    @xmath70 ( q ) & = & ( f \\rhd g ) ( q ) \\rhd ( h \\rhd k ) ( q ) \\\\ & = & ( f(q ) \\rhd g ( q ) ) \\rhd ( h(q ) \\rhd k(q ) ) \\\\ & = & ( f(q ) \\rhd h(q ) ) \\rhd ( g(q ) \\rhd k(q ) ) \\\\ % \\qquad \\qquad \\textrm{since $ a$ is abelian } \\\\ & = &   ( f \\rhd h)(q ) \\rhd ( g \\rhd k)(q ) \\\\ & = & [ ( f \\rhd h ) \\rhd ( g \\rhd k)](q )   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    when the domain quandle @xmath1 is a knot quandle , we can interpret the pointwise quandle operation in terms of knot diagrams .",
    "in particular , @xmath71 can be represented as the set of @xmath0-labelings of a fixed diagram @xmath72 of @xmath0 ; the @xmath11 operation on diagrams is then given by the pointwise operation on the arc labels , i.e. @xmath73    then at any crossing , we have @xmath74 on the one hand , we have @xmath75 by definition of the @xmath11 operation on diagrams ; on the other hand , for the labeling to be a valid quandle labeling , we must have @xmath76 .",
    "thus , we have    [ p : main ] the set @xmath77 forms a quandle under the pointwise @xmath11 operation if and only if @xmath78 , i.e. , if and only if @xmath0 is abelian .",
    "the hom quandle @xmath79 inherits many properties held by the target quandle @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath0 be quandles , where @xmath0 is abelian . if @xmath0 is commutative or involutory , then @xmath79 is also commutative or involutory .",
    "this follows from a straightforward computation .",
    "an additional observation :    let @xmath1 be a quandle and @xmath80 be abelian quandles .",
    "then * hom*@xmath81 * hom*@xmath82 .",
    "this follows from a straightforward computation .",
    "let @xmath1 be a finitely generated quandle and @xmath0 a finite abelian quandle .",
    "then @xmath79 contains a subquandle isomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "define maps @xmath83 by @xmath84 for all @xmath54 and consider the map @xmath85 defined by @xmath86 .",
    "first , note that @xmath87 is a homomorphism of quandles since for any @xmath88 we have @xmath89 then for any @xmath54 , we have @xmath90 as required .",
    "further , @xmath87 is injective since @xmath91 implies @xmath92 which implies @xmath93 .",
    "then the image subquandle @xmath94 is isomorphic to @xmath0 .",
    "more generally , we have    let @xmath1 be a finitely generated quandle and @xmath0 an abelian quandle .",
    "then @xmath79 is isomorphic to a subquandle of @xmath95 where @xmath96 is minimal number of generators of @xmath1 .",
    "let @xmath97 be a set of generators of @xmath1 with minimal cardinality .",
    "any homomoprhism @xmath98 must send each @xmath99 to an element @xmath100 in @xmath0 , and such an assignment of images to generators defines a quandle homomorphism if and only if the relations in @xmath1 are satisfied by the assignment , i.e. if and only if @xmath101 for all @xmath102 .",
    "then the elements of @xmath79 can be identified with the subset of @xmath103 consisting of @xmath96-tuples of images of generators under @xmath104 satisfying the relations in @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath105 the pointwise operation in @xmath79 agrees with the componentwise operation in the cartesian product @xmath103 ,",
    "@xmath106 so @xmath79 is isomorphic to the subquandle of @xmath103 consisting of @xmath96-tuples satisfying the relations of @xmath1 .    in the simplest case",
    ", we can identify the structure of the hom quandle . recall that the _ trivial quandle of @xmath107 elements _ is a set @xmath108 of cardinality @xmath107 with quandle operation @xmath53 for all @xmath19 .",
    "that is , the trivial quandle has quandle matrix @xmath109.\\ ] ]    [ t - hom ] any map between trivial quandles is a quandle homomorphism .",
    "let @xmath110 be a map between trivial quandles @xmath108 and @xmath111 .",
    "then for any @xmath112 , we have @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "thus @xmath115 and @xmath104 is a quandle homomoprhism .",
    "let @xmath108 and @xmath111 be the trivial quandles of orders @xmath107 and @xmath116 , respectively",
    ". then @xmath117 .",
    "let @xmath118 and @xmath119 .",
    "any map @xmath110 can be encoded as a vector @xmath120 and there are @xmath121 such maps . indeed ,",
    "every such map is quandle homomorphism by lemma [ t - hom ] .",
    "now , define @xmath122 by @xmath123 then @xmath87 is a bijection ; the inverse map rewrites @xmath124 in base-@xmath116 .",
    "the quandle structure on @xmath125 is defined by @xmath126 so we have @xmath127 for all @xmath128 and @xmath125 is a trivial quandle .",
    "then by lemma [ t - hom ] , @xmath87 is an isomorphism of quandles .",
    "recall that for any oriented knot @xmath4 and finite quandle @xmath0 , the cardinality of the hom set @xmath77 is a computable knot invariant . as we have seen ,",
    "if @xmath0 is abelian then the hom set is not just a set but a quandle .",
    "the natural question is then whether the hom quandle is a stronger invariant than the counting invariant . in general ,",
    "an invariant which determines the counting invariant is an _ enhancement _ of the counting invariant , and if there are examples in which the enhancement distinguishes knots or links which have the same counting invariant , we say the enhancement is a _ proper enhancement_. thus , we would like to know whether the hom quandle is a proper enhancement .",
    "it turns out , the answer is yes :",
    "if we think of quandles as the algebraic structure encoding the oriented reidemeister moves where the inbound overcrossing arc act on the inbound undercrossing arc at a crossing , it natural to ask what algebraic structure results when we allow both inbound _ semiarcs _ , i.e. portions of the knot divided at both over and undercrossings , to act on each other at a crossing .",
    "the resulting algebraic structure is known as a _",
    "biquandle _ ; see @xcite .",
    "more precisely , we have    we can generalize the abelian property from quandles to biquandles @xmath5 by requiring that the set of biquandle homomorphsims @xmath129 forms a biquandle under the diagrammatic operations analogous to the quandle case .",
    "@xmath130 more precisely , we have    as with quandles , we have    if @xmath131 is a biquandle and @xmath5 is an abelian biquandle , then the set of biquandle homomorphisms @xmath132 has a biquandle structure defined by @xmath133    in particular , if @xmath5 is a finite abelian biquandle , then the hom biquandle @xmath134 is a link invariant which determines , but is not determined by , the biquandle counting invariant .",
    "since we know that the collection of homomorphisms between two abelian quandles forms an abelian quandle , a natural question to ask is whether the category of abelian quandles is a ` symmetric monoidal closed ' category . in this section ,",
    "we show that the answer to this question is yes .",
    "recall that a symmetric monoidal category @xmath135 is _ closed _ if for any object @xmath136 , the functor @xmath137 has a right adjoint .",
    "we will denote this right adjoint by @xmath138 and the adjointness condition then says : @xmath139 for all @xmath140 and where  = \" means natural isomorphism . the right adjoint @xmath141 is uniquely determined by adjointness and defines a functor @xmath142 .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath0 be abelian quandles .",
    "we define the _ tensor product _ , @xmath143 , to be the free quandle on the set @xmath144 quotiented out by the relations @xmath145 for @xmath146 and @xmath147 . for abelian quandles",
    "@xmath5 , a homomorphism @xmath148 is essentially the same thing as a _ bihomomorphism _ , that is , a function @xmath149 such that :    * @xmath150 is a homomorphism for each @xmath151 , and * @xmath152 is a homomorphism for each @xmath153 .",
    "the unit for this tensor product is the one - element quandle @xmath154 , which can be checked directly .",
    "we note that , in principle , the unit is actually the free quandle on a single generator , but that is , in fact , the one - element quandle due to the first quandle axiom .",
    "we remark that this situation works very much as it does for modules .",
    "the key point is that both the theory of abelian quandles and the theory of modules are ` commutative ' theories .",
    "we recall that a _ commutative theory _ is an algebraic theory such that each operation of the theory is a homomorphism .",
    "for example , the theory of abelian groups is commutative because for any abelian group @xmath155 , the map @xmath156 is a homomorphism . more explicitly , in a commutative theory , given any @xmath107-ary operation @xmath157 and any @xmath116-ary operation @xmath158 , the equation @xmath159 holds .",
    "since the theory of quandles only has one operation @xmath160 , all we need is the equation @xmath161 and this is precisely what the definition of abelian quandle guarantees .      by theorem [ p : main ] , we know that given abelian quandles @xmath1 and @xmath0 , the set hom@xmath162 becomes an abelian quandle under pointwise operations . indeed , @xmath163 is the underlying set of @xmath164 .",
    "it is not difficult to show that a homomorphism @xmath148 is essentially the same thing as a homomorphism @xmath165 .",
    "this fact , more formally , gives us the answer to the question raised at the beginning of this section :    the category of abelian quandles is symmetric monoidal closed under the tensor product @xmath166 and closed structure defined above .",
    "this follows from the main theorem of linton @xcite since the theory of abelian quandles is commutative .",
    "we note that this means the category of abelian quandles can be enriched over itself , and the adjointness condition @xmath167 is a natural isomorphism of quandles @xmath168 .",
    "in this section we collect a few questions for future research .    in @xcite",
    ", joyce shows that the fundamental abelian quandle of a classical knot determines , and is determined by , the fundamental alexander quandle of the knot .",
    "is the analogous statement true for alexander biquandles ?",
    "what other properties does the hom quandle , hom@xmath162 inherit from the quandles @xmath1 and @xmath0 ?",
