    "the spin - boson model is the simplest model that describes a quantum two - level system subjected to the influence of a dissipative environment .",
    "it has applications in various fields in physics  @xcite and its properties are studied extensively .",
    "@xcite especially , for the bath spectra exponent @xmath15 ( sub - ohmic bath ) , the ground state of the spin - boson model may change from the spin - tunneling state to the spin - pinned state through a second - order phase transition , as the dissipation strength crosses a critical value from below .",
    "this environment - induced quantum phase transition attracts much attention in the past few years .",
    "@xcite    among the many theoretical methods that have been used to study this quantum phase transition , the bosonic numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method is regarded as the most accurate one .",
    "technically , nrg is composed of three standard procedures : logarithmic discretization , transforming the hamiltonian into a semi - infinite chain , and the iterative diagonalization .",
    "thanks to the logarithmic discretization , the state information at exponentially small energy scales is kept along the iterative diagonalization .",
    "therefore , nrg allows for reliable extraction of critical exponents and description of the crossover behavior .",
    "two parameters control the precision of nrg , i.e. , the logarithmic discretization @xmath5 ( @xmath16 ) and the number of kept states @xmath17 . the original wilson s nrg is designed for the impurity problem with a fermionic bath .",
    "@xcite in the past few years , the extension of nrg to impurity models with bosonic bath , such as the spin - boson model , proved to be fruitful .",
    "@xcite due to the infinite local hilbert space for each bosonic bath mode , one has to truncate the space into @xmath18 states .",
    "usually the boson occupation states are used as the local bases , although optimal bases have also been considered .",
    "@xcite using this bosonic nrg ( bnrg ) , the thermodynamical as well as dynamical quantities for the spin - boson model are studied and the critical exponents in the sub - ohmic regime obtained .",
    "although it was clear that the localized fixed point ( @xmath19 ) can not be described exactly due to the truncation of boson states , it was believed and partly checked  @xcite that the bnrg shares the virtue of nrg , i.e , the parameters @xmath5 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 only influences the value of non - universal quantities , such as the critical point value @xmath20 and the prefactors of power laws .",
    "the exact value of them can be reliably obtained by extrapolating @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 .",
    "the universal quantities such as the critical exponents are not supposed to depend on @xmath5 , @xmath24 , or @xmath4 .    for the quantum critical behavior of the spin - boson model in the sub - ohmic regime ,",
    "the following critical exponents have been studied  @xcite :    @xmath25    here , @xmath26 and @xmath10 describe the coupling strength between the spin and bosons , and the bias field on the spin , respectively . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are static susceptibility and dynamical spin correlation function , respectively .",
    "the naive bnrg study of these critical exponents leads to the following conclusions .",
    "@xcite ( i ) in the regime @xmath29 , the critical fixed points are interacting and the corresponding critical exponents are non - classical ; and ( ii ) the hyperscaling relation and @xmath30 scaling hold . in the regime @xmath0 , these conclusions are in contrast to previous theories based on the quantum - to - classical mapping .",
    "there , the spin - boson model is mapped into a one - dimensional ising model with @xmath31 .",
    "@xcite in the regime @xmath32 , this ising model is above its upper critical dimension , leading to gaussian critical fixed point and classical exponents .",
    "the hyperscaling relation and @xmath30 scaling do not hold there .",
    "@xcite recently , using a number of new methods ,  @xcite the quantum phase transition in the sub - ohmic spin - boson model has been studied . the obtained critical coupling strength @xmath33,@xcite the exponent @xmath34 ,  @xcite and @xmath35 ( ref .  )",
    "are consistent with the bnrg results .",
    "however , the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulation  @xcite and the exact diagonalization study  @xcite found that in the regime @xmath0 , the critical point is gaussian with classical exponent @xmath7 , being different from the bnrg conclusion . in the regime @xmath36 ,",
    "bnrg results are consistent with the quantum - to - classical mapping theory which predicts an interacting fixed point and @xmath30 scaling .",
    "recently , a closer examination of bnrg method discloses two sources of error , which were not noticed before .",
    "one is the boson state truncation error ,  @xcite the other is the mass - flow error .",
    "@xcite the boson state truncation error spoils the evaluation of the order - parameter related exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 , while the mass - flow problem influences the correct evaluation of @xmath37 .",
    "the two sources of error are different in nature and exist simultaneously in the bnrg algorithm in the whole regime @xmath38 .",
    "but , they influence the critical behavior only in the regime @xmath32 , where the critical fixed point is expected to be gaussian in the absence of these errors .    for the mean - field spin - boson model which has a gaussian critical fixed point ,  @xcite we showed that the boson state truncation leads to an artificial interacting fixed point in the regime @xmath39 , but has no influence in @xmath40 .",
    "this is an example where the boson - state truncation destroys the gaussian fixed point and spoils the correct calculation of the exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it leads to the surmise that the same may happen in the bnrg study of the spin - boson model .",
    "it would be difficult to find the gaussian nature of the critical fixed point in @xmath32 using bnrg , if the truncation works the same way as in the mean - field hamiltonian .    in ref .",
    ", the boson - state truncation error is traced back to the presence of a dangerously irrelevant variable for a gaussian critical fixed point .",
    "the correct exponent can be seen on the intermediate scales . for the more fundamental problem of mass- flow error , vojta _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have proposed an extended nrg algorithm to partly remedy the problem and got the correct exponent @xmath41 in @xmath32 . in this paper , we focus on the boson state truncation error . in the bnrg , it is still unclear how a finite @xmath4 leads to wrong @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and how to extract the correct exponents . for the spin - boson model , a thorough numerical study in the regime @xmath42 is required to prove or disprove the validity of the quantum - to - classical mapping in this model.@xcite here , we use the scaling approach to analyze the bnrg data with respect to boson - state truncation @xmath18 , logarithmic discretization parameter @xmath5 , and tunneling strength @xmath6 .",
    "we find that for any finite @xmath4 , the order parameter @xmath43 has a multiple power form like that at the tricritical point ,  @xcite with nonclassical exponents @xmath1 and @xmath2 dominated by the discretization scheme . the correct power- law behavior can be observed on the intermediate scale away from the critical point .",
    "these two different power - law regimes are connected at a crossover scale , which goes to zero as a power of @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",

    ", however , there is no divergence in the displacement and all the modes can be described equally well by a finite @xmath4 , hence the truncation error disappears .",
    "since the critical exponents are closely related to the energy distribution and the displacement behavior of the low - energy boson modes , they are susceptible to the truncation . while the critical coupling is dominated by the integral properties of the spectrum in which the high - energy modes have more weights , it is thus only very weakly influenced by the truncation .",

    "@xcite since the fermion bath in the ising bfkm can be integrated out to produce an additional boson bath with ohmic spectrum , the critical behavior should be dominated by the sub - ohmic one , leading to the expectation that it belongs to the same universality class as the spin - boson model . in the quantum monte carlo simulations , it was observed that the truncation of correlations in the imaginary time axis is the key to produce the interacting critical point .",
