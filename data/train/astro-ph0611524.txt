    "theoretical calculations predict a cusp of around @xmath2 20000 stellar mass black holes in the central parsec of our galaxy @xcite and a similar number of neutron stars @xcite .",
    "x - ray observations reveal a highly significant overabundance of transients in the same region @xcite as compared with the region of @xmath2 several tens of parsecs from sgr  a@xmath1 , the @xmath3 super - massive black hole @xcite in the galactic centre ( gc ) .",
    "@xcite proposed that these compact remnants may be accreting gas at relatively high rates when they happen to travel through a dense ionised gas observed to exist in the gc ( also see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "they calculated a simple time - averaged model for x - ray emission from such a cusp , and concluded that the total emission of the cusp could be as high as @xmath4 erg s@xmath5 , i.e. very significant observationally .",
    "on the other hand , a time - independent treatment does not do justice to the complexity of the problem . despite the high total number of black holes , due to a small volume filling fraction of cold gas in the gc",
    ", only a few of the black holes will be moving within the gas clouds and possess a small enough relative velocity to be visible to _ chandra_. here we extend the model of @xcite in two ways .",
    "firstly , we allow time - dependency in the problem by explicitly following realistic keplerian orbits of the compact objects . secondly , we model the formation and evolution of small scale accretion discs around the accretors , as such discs will surely form due to an excess angular momentum in the accreting gas .",
    "non - circular gas orbits are also considered with a simplified approach .",
    "our models show a large intrinsic time - dependence of the accretion on the compact objects and the x - ray emission it produces . despite that , and despite internal uncertainties of the model ( exact gas orbits , circularisation radius parameter , radiative efficiency , etc . )",
    ", we feel that certain rather robust conclusions can be drawn .",
    "in particular , with the @xmath6 compact remnants expected in the central parsec , at least several x - ray sources with x - ray luminosity greater than @xmath7 erg s@xmath5 should be present .",
    "such sources , which can be called `` fake x - ray binaries '' for obvious reasons , can potentially contribute to the sources observed by @xcite in the central parsec .",
    "conversely , it appears that a cusp significantly more populous , i.e. , with 40000 compact remnants , would over - produce the x - ray emission as compared to the observations , and should thus be ruled out .",
    "the basis of our setup is explained in @xcite , and hence we shall only briefly discuss the main points , sparing detail for the improvements introduced here .",
    "we assume that a stellar mass black hole travelling through a gas cloud or a disc with density @xmath8 is capturing gas in a _ small scale disc about it _ ( see below ) at the @xcite accretion rate : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the gas sound speed and the relative velocity between the black hole and the gas , respectively .",
    "the above picture is complicated by the presence of the smbh .",
    "the area of influence of the stellar mass black holes is limited by the hill s radius , @xmath12 , where r is the distance between the stellar mass black hole and the smbh .",
    "this imposes a limit on the capture rate , given by the hill accretion rate , @xmath13 .",
    "hence , @xmath14\\ ] ] where @xmath15 on the right hand side of the equation is defined in eq.1 .",
    "the captured gas may have a net angular momentum resulting in the formation of a disk around the stellar mass black hole .",
    "the disc size is of order of the circularisation radius for the gas flow , @xmath16 , which is unknown a priori .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath16 is the capture radius , @xmath17 , which is @xmath18\\;. \\label{rcapt}\\ ] ] we thus parametrise the circularisation radius as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a parameter less than unity .",
    "the viscous time scale in such a disk around the stellar mass black hole is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the viscosity parameter , @xmath23 is the angular velocity of the disk and @xmath24 is the height scale of the disk .",
    "numerically , @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the disk temperature in units of @xmath27 k , the viscosity parameter is @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the mean molecular mass in units of hydrogen mass and @xmath30 is the circularisation radius in @xmath31 cm .",
    "this is to be compared with period ( the orbital time ) about the smbh : @xmath32 here , @xmath33 is the keplerian angular frequency for the black hole orbiting the super - massive one : @xmath34 .",
    "the respective keplerian velocity is @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the gas captured in the small scale disk accretes on the black hole after a delay of a fraction of to a few ( black hole around the smbh ) orbital times .",
    "the evolution of the disk mass is given by the rate at which the mass is added , @xmath15 , minus the mass accreted onto the black hole , @xmath36 : @xmath37 the black hole accretion rate is calculated as @xmath38 ( see  5.2 in @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the luminosity of the accretion flow is modelled in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "namely , we write @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is given by @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the critical accretion rate where the switch from the radiatively efficient to radiatively inefficient regime occurs @xcite . here",
    "we also assumed that x - ray emission visible in the _ chandra _ band constitutes 10% of the bolometric efficiency , which would be a lower limit for typical spectra of x - ray binaries in their hard state .",
    "we model the velocity and space distribution of stellar mass black holes as a cusp that follows the @xcite distribution for heavier species in a mass - segregated cusp .",
    "this distribution results in the black hole number density and velocity distribution obeying power laws of the form @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively , where , @xmath45 both space and velocity distributions are isotropic .",
    "the most recent monte - carlo simulations @xcite broadly support these classical results .",
    "a recent fokker - planck study @xcite predicts a somewhat steeper power - law density dependence for the black hole cusp , @xmath46 , but we leave this level of detail for future investigations .    our black hole cusp is sharply cut at @xmath47 pc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . clearly , the artificial cut of the black hole distribution at the outer cusp radius is a crude approximation to the more complicated broken power - law structure of the cusp found by @xcite .",
    "it is also not entirely self - consistent as black holes do follow their orbits hence changing their radial position . to determine the significance of this we examined the structure of our model cusp in @xmath48 years after it was set up .",
    "the density profile did in fact change .",
    "some of black holes on eccentric orbits with large semi - major axes were found at radii much larger than the outer cusp radius assumed , as expected .",
    "however , the maximum change in the black hole density profile was no more than 30% .",
    "furthermore , the black holes on very eccentric orbits will be those that accrete gas at a low rate unless gas in the inner parsec moves on similar eccentric orbits .",
    "therefore emission from these black holes might be neglected in any event .",
    "generating a series of orbits consistent with this space - velocity distribution , we randomly set the initial phases of the black holes along their orbits , and then we follow their spatial motion .",
    "we also track the instantaneous gas capture rate for each black hole .",
    "when one of these orbits intersects the disc of the minispiral , the black hole in question starts capturing gas and builds up a disc around it as described in ",
    "[ sec : smalldisc ] .",
    "@xcite suggests that the minispiral is a dynamical feature in a state of almost a free fall onto sgr  a@xmath1 .",
    "we feel that the minispiral s orbit is not likely to be so radial , as one would then expect sgr  a@xmath1  itself to be accreting from the minispiral .",
    "this would result in accretion rates far above that from the stellar winds @xcite , and would contradict the x - ray observations ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "more realistically the gas in the minispiral follows an eccentric orbit which does not enter the inner arcsecond ( @xmath49 parsec ) of the gc .    in our simple model ,",
    "the minispiral is modelled as half of a disc in a local keplerian circular rotation around sgr  a@xmath1  with the total gas mass of @xmath50 , in accord with estimates in @xcite .",
    "it extends from a radius of 0.1 pc from the smbh to a radius of 0.5 pc .",
    "the disc heightscale , @xmath51 , is assumed to have a fixed ratio to the radius , @xmath52 : @xmath53 .",
    "the gas density is given by @xmath54 .",
    "the dynamical age of the minispiral is a few thousand years .",
    "therefore , we ran our calculations for 3000 years with these assumptions , and then we `` remove '' the minispiral instantaneously .",
    "this is done as a rough model of time evolution of the system in the case the gas apocenter is larger than 0.5 parsec , so that the minispiral would leave the inner 0.5 parsec after a dynamical time . in  [ sec : sens ] we vary some of the above assumptions about the structure of the minispiral to estimate sensitivity of our results to these assumptions . in a future work",
    "a more complicated , but unavoidably model - dependent dynamic of the minispiral should be included .",
    ".orbital parameters of individual black hole orbits ( see  [ sec : individual ] ) .",
    "the inclination of the orbit is with respect to the midplane of the minispiral .",
