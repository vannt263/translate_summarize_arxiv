    "this paper is devoted to the construction of a numerical scheme for the simulation of a two - fluid euler - lorentz model : such a model represents the evolution of a mixture of an ion gas and an electron gas which are submitted to the _",
    "lorentz force_. more precisely , we focus in this paper on a situation involving a strong lorentz force and a low mach number regime for both ion and electron fluids , _",
    "i.e. _ we assume that pressure and lorentz forces are of the same order as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the square of the ion mach number and also represents the ratio between the ion gyro - period and the characteristic time scale of the experiment .",
    "when @xmath3 converges to 0 , we reach an asymptotic regime which is referred to as the _ drift - fluid regime _ or _",
    "gyro - fluid regime _ : in this limit regime , the pressure force for the ions and for the electrons is balanced by lorentz force . in return , the momentum equations within the two - fluid euler system degenerate into a pair of equations in which the parallel components of the ion and electron velocities can be viewed as lagrange multipliers of the zero total force equations in the direction of the magnetic field ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ such a model describes plasma physics experiments involving strong external magnetic fields , such as magnetic confinement fusion ( mcf ) experiments in tokamak reactors .",
    "in such a case , the rescaled gyro - period of the confined particles , which is denoted by @xmath3 , can be close to 0 .",
    "the assumption that @xmath3 is very small leads to a singularly perturbed euler - lorentz model .",
    "the limit @xmath4 is referred to as the _ gyro - fluid _ limit ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is also possible to consider a _",
    "gyro - kinetic _ approach when a kinetic model is considered from the onset , instead of fluid equations ( see @xcite ) . for generalities on asymptotic regimes for fusion plasmas physics , we refer to @xcite .",
    "+ in many experimental cases , the value of @xmath3 is not uniform and can vary a lot between subdomains of the tokamak .",
    "additionally , it may depend on the time variable : in most of mcf experiments , @xmath3 is very small in the plasma core whereas it can be of order 1 far from the plasma core . from a numerical point of view , the usual approach for simulating both cases together consists in a domain decomposition according to the local value of @xmath3 .",
    "more precisely , we choose to simulate the initial @xmath3-dependent model in the regions where @xmath5 , and we choose the limit model in the regions where @xmath6 .",
    "such an approach involves different numerical methods for solving either the euler - lorentz model or its drift - fluid limit according to the value of @xmath3 .",
    "generally , the coupling of these methods is not straightforward and presents several drawbacks such as the treatment of the interface position ( or cross - talk region ) : indeed , it can depend on the time variable and , in most cases , costly algorithms are required to simulate the motion of the interface and to couple it with the space mesh . + we choose a different method based on the resolution of the @xmath3-dependent euler - lorentz model and on the design of a scheme which is able to handle both the cases @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "then this so - called _ asymptotic - preserving ( ap ) method _ provides consistent approximation of the euler - lorentz model when @xmath5 and of its limit regime when @xmath4 , and does not require a @xmath3-dependent stability condition . as a consequence ,",
    "such a method can be used on the whole simulation domain for both the @xmath5 and @xmath6 regimes .",
    "ap schemes have been introduced by s. jin @xcite and were applied on tranport models and their diffusive limits .",
    "other applications can be found in plasma physics ( see @xcite for quasi - neutrality regimes and @xcite for strong magnetic fields regimes ) , low mach number fluid dynamics ( see @xcite ) , or other types of transport problems ( see @xcite ) or diffusion problems ( see @xcite ) .",
    "+ the present paper has two main goals : the first one is to propose a new equivalent formulation of the two - fluid euler - lorentz model when @xmath2 . in this new formulation ,",
    "the parallel velocity equation for @xmath7 explicitly appears as the limit of the parallel velocity equation for @xmath2 by contrast to the original formulation .",
    "this reformulation is the building block for the asymptotic - preserving scheme for the two - fluid euler - lorentz model . for the scheme being simple ,",
    "we choose an isothermal pressure law for both ion and electron fluids .",
    "we also assume that the fluids are coupled through a quasi - neutrality constraint which allows us to compute the self - consistent electric field within the lorentz term , the magnetic field being external and given .",
    "this work is the last development of a program started in @xcite : in @xcite and @xcite , the one - fluid isentropic euler - lorentz model with given electric and magnetic fields has been investigated ( in @xcite , under a uniform magnetic field and in @xcite , with any magnetic field and arbitrary coordinate system ) . here",
    ", the specificity of this work is to consider a two - fluid euler - lorentz model with self - consistent electric field , computed through the quasi - neutrality hypothesis .",
    "this leads to a system of two coupled anisotropic diffusion equations , which brings some specific difficulties .",
    "in particular , it involves some singularity which will be treated through a regularization procedure .",
    "this work also bears relations with @xcite which are concerned with more general anisotropic diffusion equations ( but not in the context of the euler - lorentz model ) .",
    "again , @xcite deals with a uniform anisotropy direction and @xcite with an arbitrary anisotropy direction and arbitrary coordinate systems compared to the direction of the anisotropy . + the present paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we present the isothermal two - fluid euler - lorentz model and the drift - fluid limit regime .",
    "the section 3 is devoted to the reformulation of the @xmath3-dependent euler - lorentz model leading to a new equivalent formulation of these equations when @xmath2 which is equivalent to the drift - fluid limit when @xmath7 . in section 4",
    ", we present a time semi - discretization of the euler - lorentz model which is also consistent with the new formulation of the model .",
    "since this time semi - discrete scheme involves an ill - posed diffusion problem for the electric potential , we choose to recover the well - posedness of this problem by introducing a regularization of the quasi - neutrality constraint .",
    "this is the subject of the second part of section 4 . in section 5 ,",
    "we present a fully - discrete finite volume scheme based on the ap scheme for the euler - lorentz model coupled with the perturbed quasi - neutrality constraint .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we present some numerical results which have been obtained with this scheme .",
    "in this paragraph , we present the scaling of euler - lorentz equations which leads to the dimensionless following model :    [ el_rescaled ] _ tn^ + _ _ ^ = 0 , & [ el_rescaled_n ] +    _ + & t__n^ + & = _ ,    & [ el_rescaled_q ] + \\{i , e } ,    where @xmath3 is the ratio between the ion gyro - period and the characteristic time scale but also the square value of the ion mach number , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the dimensionleass ion and electron temperatures , and @xmath10 and @xmath11 are defined by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ratio between the unit electron mass and the unit ion mass .",
    "finally , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 correspond to the dimensionless ion and electron density , the dimensionless ion momentum , the dimensionless electron momentum , the dimensionless electric potential and the external magnetic field and are functions of the position @xmath19 and of the time @xmath20 . + our starting point is the two - fluid euler - lorentz model describing a mixture of an ion gas and an electron gas",
    ". this model writes @xmath21 and the ion - electron coupling is insured by the following quasi - neutrality constraint @xmath22 in this two - fluid model , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ( resp .",

    "electron ) gas .",
    "the physical constants @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 stand for the unit ion mass , the unit electron mass and the absolute value of unit electron charge .",
    "the electric and magnetic fields are denoted with @xmath34 and @xmath18 and we assume that @xmath18 is given whereas @xmath34 is generated by the ions and the electrons through the constraint ( [ qn_origin ] ) .",
    "+ in the present context , we assume that both ion and electron gases are isothermal , _",
    "i.e. _ we assume that @xmath26 and @xmath30 are given by @xmath35 with constant temperatures @xmath36 and @xmath9 , and we also assume that the electric field @xmath34 derives from a potential @xmath37 , _ i.e. _ @xmath38 .",
    "+ consequently , the model ( [ full_el_origin])-([qn_origin ] ) is reduced to @xmath39 we introduce characteristic length @xmath40 , time @xmath41 , momentum @xmath42 , ion temperature @xmath43 , electric potential @xmath44 , and magnetic field @xmath45 such that @xmath46    @xmath47    we consider the natural ratio @xmath48 and we also assume that the electric and magnetic forces are of the same order , which means in terms of characteristic scales that @xmath49 we define the characteristic sound speed @xmath50 for the ions , the characteristic mach number for the ions @xmath51 and the characteristic cyclotron frequency @xmath52 for the ions by @xmath53 considering a low mach number regime induces @xmath54 with @xmath55 small and assuming that the applied magnetic field is strong allows us to take @xmath56 finally , we denote the ratio @xmath57 with @xmath13 and we assume that it is a dimensionless fixed constant . then , removing the primed notations and adding @xmath3 in exponent , we finally obtain the rescaled isothermal two - fluid euler - lorentz model writing ( [ el_rescaled ] ) .",
    "if @xmath3 converges to 0 in ( [ el_rescaled ] ) , we formally get the model    [ el_limit ] _",

    "one way to answer to this difficulty is to couple the limit model ( [ el_limit_decompo ] ) with the following equations : @xmath70 = 0 \\ , , \\end{split } \\\\",

    "in order to validate the coupling between ( [ el_limit_decompo ] ) and ( [ q_para_0 ] ) , we have to insure that @xmath75 these properties are validated since the euler - lorentz equations ( [ el_rescaled ] ) are equivalent to    [ el_reformulated_final ]    & _ t^2n^ - _ ( ( ) ( t__n^ + _ n^ _ ^ ) ) + & = _ ( ( _ t ( ) ) _ ^ - ( ) _ ( ) -_t((_^ ) _ ) ) ,    & [ el_reformulated_final_zero_force ] +    _ t((_^)_|| ) - ( _ t ( & ) ) _ ^ + ( ) _ ( ) + & + ( ) ( t__n^ + _ n^ _ ^ ) = 0 ,    & [ el_reformulated_final_qpara ] +    ( _ ^ ) _ = ( _ t _ & _ n^ + n^_^ ) + & + ,    & [ el_reformulated_final_qiperp ] + \\{i , e } ,    and more precisely thanks to the diffusion equations ( [ el_reformulated_final_zero_force ] ) for both @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "these equations are obtained for ( [ el_rescaled ] ) by a differentiation in time and position procedure and projections in the direction of @xmath78 and perpendicularly to @xmath78 .",
    "more details about these computations can be found in appendix [ reformulation_continuous ] .",

    "in this section , we propose a semi - discretization of ( [ el_rescaled ] ) in time which is also consistent with the reformulated model ( [ el_reformulated_final ] ) : proceeding in such a way insures us that the approximation which will be computed ought to this numerical method will be also consistent with ( [ el_limit_reformulated_final ] ) and , equivalently , with ( [ el_limit ] ) when @xmath3 converges to 0 .",
    "+ more precisely , the semi - discretization we describe in the the next lines is based on semi - implicit mass fluxes and fully implicit pressure and lorentz forces .",
    "this strategy is motivated by the fact that we want to preserve the balance between the pressure gradient and the lorentz term , _",

    "+ firstly , we describe the semi - discretization and we reformulate the semi - discrete model which is obtained by following the same approach as in section [ reformulation ] .",
    "then we discuss the difficulties which are brought by this reformulation and we introduce a regularization of the mass conservation equations ( [ el_rescaled_n ] ) which allows us to bypass these difficulties .",

    "as it has been announced above , we chose to implicit the whole pressure and lorentz terms in order to have ( [ ap_property_sd ] ) at every time step .",
    "the choice of the implicitation of the parallel part of the mass fluxes is motivated by the fact that we have to reformulate the model ( [ semi - discrete_origin ] ) by injecting the parallel part of ( [ semi - discrete_origin_q ] ) with @xmath76 ( resp .",
    "@xmath77 ) in ( [ semi - discrete_origin_n ] ) with @xmath76 ( resp .",
    "@xmath77 ) .",
    "such a procedure leads to the separate computation of @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 by applying projection operators in the @xmath89 and orthogonal to @xmath89 directions .",
