    "the origin of electroweak symmetry breaking remains a principal open question in high - energy physics . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the breakdown of the electroweak symmetry is induced by the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field , which transforms non - trivially under the @xmath4 symmetry .",
    "a consequence of this mechanism of spontaneous symmetry breaking is the presence of a physical scalar higgs particle , with well - defined couplings to fermions and gauge bosons .",
    "the search for such a particle at lepton and hadron colliders is therefore a paramount goal in particle physics .",
    "the lep experiments have already excluded at 95% c.l .",
    "the presence of a sm - like higgs with mass below 114.4  gev  @xcite . in the coming years",
    ", higgs searches will be performed at hadron colliders .",
    "the tevatron collider at fermilab has an active higgs search program and has already excluded a sm - like higgs at 95% c.l . in the mass range 160170  gev  @xcite .",
    "the tevatron is expected to operate until the end of 2011 .",
    "it is likely that by this time the cdf and d0 experiments will collect 1012  @xmath5 apiece and achieve some improvements in the analysis , yielding a significant chance that they will be able to probe the entire sm higgs mass range @xmath6 .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached for the parameter space of the higgs sector in the @xmath0-conserving mssm , provided that the limits derived from sm - like higgs searches are statistically combined with limits from direct searches for the non - standard higgs bosons  @xcite .",
    "the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern will begin collisions at the end of 2009 with an expected center - of - mass energy of several tev , and the atlas and cms experiments will collect on the order of a few hundred pb@xmath7 of data during 2010 .",
    "a higher center of mass energy of @xmath8 is expected to be achieved after this run , once the necessary upgrades are completed",
    ". the anticipated rate of data acquisition at @xmath9 in the early years of the lhc is expected to be a few to 10  fb@xmath7/year .",
    "once the lhc acquires a few fb@xmath7 of data at @xmath8 , the tevatron and lhc reaches for a light higgs boson may be comparable and even complementary in some searches . eventually , once the lhc experiments collect 10 to 30  fb@xmath7 of @xmath8 data , the lhc will probe the sm and mssm higgs sectors at high statistical significance , far superior to what is attainable at the tevatron  @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we analyze the tevatron and lhc reach for the mssm higgs sector  @xcite@xcite in the presence of explicit @xmath0-violation  @xcite@xcite . at the tevatron",
    "we consider 10 fb@xmath7 in all channels and provide projections for a set of possible improvements in signal efficiencies . for the lhc , to study the possible initial complementarity with the tevatron results , we consider the case of 3 fb@xmath7 at @xmath8 . to display the long - term lhc capabilities , we also show the results for 30 fb@xmath7 at @xmath8 in the most challenging scenario .",
    "let us mention that there are alternative possibilities for the lhc timeline where the collision energy is kept below @xmath8 for several years , and the upgrade to @xmath8 is only completed later .",
    "we do not attempt an analysis of these scenarios because we base our study on the higgs reach projections presented by the lhc collaborations , which are only fully complete for a center of mass energy of @xmath8 .",
    "for reference , preliminary results indicate that to obtain the same higgs reach , the luminosity at @xmath10 should be twice as large as that which is required at 14  tev  @xcite .",
    "our work differs in three significant ways from previous analyses of higgs searches in the mssm with explicit @xmath0-violation performed in refs .",
    "first , for the tevatron we use the 2009 limits from the cdf and d0 experiments given in refs .  @xcite@xcite . for the lhc",
    "we incorporate the projections presented by the experimental collaborations in the most recent technical design and expected physics performance documents  @xcite .",
    "these projections show marked differences from the earlier tdrs , and as a result the priority for some channels has been reduced , while others have been elevated . secondly ,",
    "for both colliders we analyze the potential for the non - standard mssm higgs searches , and provide the combination with the sm - like higgs reach .",
    "these two types of searches offer considerable complementarity and together can be used to cover most of the analyzed parameter space . for the tevatron",
    ", we also include the reach for the charged higgs . finally , we present the combination of the tevatron discovery reach with the lhc reach at 3  fb@xmath7 . at this low lhc integrated luminosity , the statistical significances offered by the two colliders may be comparable , and so it may be of interest to perform the combination .",
    "we present this analysis only for the sm - like higgs search channels , which offer greater complementarity than the non - standard channels .",
    "for the lhc reach we compute and combine discovery significances using poisson statistics and the profile likelihood ratio , evaluated on data fixed to the expected values for the signals and backgrounds .",
    "for the tevatron we work with 95% c.l .",
    "upper bounds on the signal presented by cdf and d0 , combining them in inverse quadrature .",
    "this combination method is strictly valid only in the gaussian limit ; however , it was tested in ref .",
    "@xcite and found to match well with the combination derived from a full analysis performed by the collaborations .",
    "a further discussion of statistical methods is presented in appendix a.    in the mssm higgs sector , @xmath0-violation can occur via the incorporation of explicit phases in the supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "@xmath0-violating phases can be removed from the tree - level higgs potential by field redefinitions .",
    "however , phases in the soft trilinear couplings and the gaugino mass terms influence the effective higgs lagrangian through loop corrections  @xcite .",
    "we shall work in the cpx benchmark scenario , defined by the following parameter values at the soft scale  @xcite : @xmath11 in the above , @xmath12 are the trilinear higgs sfermion couplings , @xmath13 is the characteristic scale of soft supersymmetry breaking scalar masses , and @xmath14 is the gluino mass .",
    "we set the top quark mass to @xmath15 .",
    "we shall perform our analysis scanning over the charged higgs mass @xmath16 and @xmath17 over the ranges @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively , for a variety of complex phases of @xmath20 and @xmath14 .",
    "masses , mixings , and branching ratios are computed with cpsuperh  @xcite and hdecay  @xcite ; sm higgs cross sections are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite and rescaled to obtain cross sections in the mssm .",
    "the dominant effects of the phases are twofold .",
    "first , they cause the neutral higgs mass eigenstates to become admixtures of @xmath0-even and @xmath0-odd components , modifying the couplings to gauge bosons relative to those in the case with no @xmath0-violation . for example",
    ", the lightest neutral higgs can now have a significant @xmath0-odd component , strongly suppressing its couplings to the @xmath21 and @xmath22 bosons .",
    "secondly , the yukawa couplings are altered , leading in particular to modifications of the neutral higgs decay branching ratios to @xmath23 and @xmath24 , and different production cross sections through the bottom quark fusion and gluon fusion mechanisms .",
    "we examine separately the reach in those channels designed to search for a higgs with sm - like gauge couplings ( hereafter referred to as an  sm - like higgs \" ) , and in those channels which probe either neutral scalars with negligible gauge couplings ( hereafter ,  non - standard higgs \" ) or charged higgs states , in order to understand the complementarity of their coverages .",
    "afterwards we combine the statistical significances of all channels to obtain an overall reach in the mssm higgs parameter space .",
    "our presentation is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the couplings of the mssm effective lagrangian that are of particular relevance for understanding the cpx reach . in section 3 we present and analyze the results for the tevatron and make conservative estimates of the improvements in signal efficiency necessary to cover large regions of parameter space . section 4 contains the projections for the lhc , and we offer conclusions in section 5 .",
    "appendix a offers a brief review of statistical methods , followed by a discussion of the approximations used in the text to compute and combine exclusion limits and discovery significances for multiple channels at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "appendix b extends some of the discussion in the text to the case of @xmath0-conserving benchmark scenarios .",
    "the radiative corrections to the yukawa couplings of higgs states to down - type fermions  @xcite@xcite play a significant role in inducing @xmath0-violating effects in the higgs sector and can strongly affect the sm - like higgs search channels at colliders .",
    "the scalar and pseudoscalar neutral higgs couplings to bottom quarks in the effective lagrangian are given by  @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the sm scalar coupling given by the bottom quark mass over the vacuum expectation value of the higgs , and @xmath27 are given by @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the neutral higgs mixing matrix , where @xmath30 is associated with the gauge eigenstate @xmath31 and @xmath32 runs over the mass states @xmath33 which are ordered so that @xmath34 , and @xmath35 parameterizes the radiative contributions from sbottom - gluino and stop - chargino loops , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a function that behaves as @xmath38  @xcite@xcite .",
    "the size of the dominant loop corrections to the higgs sector is controlled by @xmath39 , so a large value of @xmath40 is taken in cpx to accentuate the @xmath0-violating effects .    for illustration ,",
    "let us consider the behavior of the effective couplings in the simplest case of vanishing phases . in this scenario @xmath41 and",
    "@xmath42 take the approximate numerical values @xmath43 and @xmath44 , respectively , and @xmath45-conserving maximal mixing scenario @xmath46 , and in the minimal mixing scenario @xmath47 . in both of these scenarios , @xmath48  gev",
    "we denote the @xmath0-even mass eigenstates by @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where @xmath51 .",
    "we can always identify @xmath49 with @xmath52 , but due to strong radiative corrections @xmath50 can either be @xmath53 or @xmath54 depending on @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the mass states are related to the gauge eigenstates by a mixing angle @xmath55 , which satisfies @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "furthermore , the pseudoscalar effective couplings for these states vanish , and the scalar couplings are rescaled relative to their tree level values . at tree level @xmath58 and @xmath59",
    "are given by @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively , and the rescaling factors are given by @xmath62 in fig .",
    "[ effhbb ] we plot the squares of @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in the large @xmath16 limit , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , so the @xmath49 scalar",
    "coupling converges to the sm value .",
    "similarly , in the small @xmath16 limit , the @xmath54 scalar coupling becomes that of the sm .",
    "finally , in the non - standard higgs limit ( large @xmath16 for @xmath50 , or small @xmath16 for @xmath49 ) and for large @xmath17 , the effective coupling of the non - standard higgs approaches @xmath65 , which should be contrasted with the tree level behavior proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "although the coupling is still enhanced relative to the sm value , it is suppressed relative to the tree level mssm value .",
    "it is important to be precise with terminology : as defined in the introduction , an sm - like higgs is one with significant couplings to vector bosons , not necessarily one with sm - like fermionic couplings .",
    "the distinction is relevant , for example , at moderate values of @xmath16 , where the first two terms of the @xmath49 scalar coupling are comparable because of the factor of @xmath35 in the second term . for these values of @xmath16",
    ", @xmath49 can be simultaneously sm - like and have an altered coupling to @xmath23 .",
    "of course , this is true even for the tree level coupling , but the effective coupling is modified relative to tree level by the factor in eq .  [ reltree ] which can generate a significant suppression when @xmath66 .",
    "it is also important to observe that the @xmath67 effective coupling must take a similar form to that of @xmath68 , but with radiative terms proportional to @xmath69 instead of @xmath70 .",
    "the effects of the threshold corrections are therefore much smaller for the @xmath24 coupling and can be qualitatively neglected .",
    "when phases are introduced , @xmath71 can become nonzero for all states .",
    "then the third term of @xmath72 in eq .",
    "[ effcoup ] is nonzero and proportional to the imaginary part of @xmath35 , which is dominated by the imaginary part of @xmath41 .",
    "this term is @xmath17-enhanced , so significant phases for @xmath73 and @xmath14 can affect the conclusions drawn above for vanishing phases , potentially even countering the suppression effect in @xmath72 .",

    "<S> we analyze the tevatron and large hadron collider ( lhc ) reach for the higgs sector of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in the presence of explicit @xmath0-violation . using the most recent studies from the tevatron and lhc collaborations , we examine the cpx benchmark scenario for a range of @xmath0-violating phases in the soft trilinear and gluino mass terms and compute the exclusion / discovery potentials for each collider on the @xmath1 plane . projected results from standard model ( sm)-like , non - standard , and charged higgs searches are combined to maximize the statistical significance . </S>",
