    "random matrix theory ( rmt ) provides a suitable framework to describe quantal systems whose classical counterpart has a chaotic dynamics @xcite .",

    "the theory is based on two main assumptions : ( i ) the matrix elements are independent identically - distributed random variables , and ( ii ) their distribution is invariant under unitary transformations .",
    "these lead to a gaussian probability density distribution for the matrix elements , @xmath1   $ ] . with these assumptions",
    ", rmt presents a satisfactory description for numerous chaotic systems . on the other hand ,",
    "there are elaborate theoretical arguments by berry and tabor @xcite , which are supported by several numerical calculations , that the nearest - neighbor - spacing ( nns ) distribution of classically integrable systems should have a poisson distribution @xmath2 , although exceptions exist .    for most systems",
    ", however , the phase space is partitioned into regular and chaotic domains .",
    "these systems are known as mixed systems .",
    "attempts to generalize rmt to describe such mixed systems are numerous ; for a review please see @xcite . most of these attempts are based on constructing ensembles of random matrices whose elements are independent but not identically distributed .",
    "thus , the resulting expressions are not invariant under base transformation .",
    "the first work in this direction is due to rosenzweig and porter @xcite .",
    "they model the hamiltonian of the mixed system by a superposition of a diagonal matrix of random elements having the same variance and a matrix drawn from a goe .",
    "therefore , the variances of the diagonal elements of the total hamiltonian are different from those of the off - diagonal ones , unlike the goe hamiltonian in which the variances of diagonal elements are twice those of the off - diagonal ones .",
    "hussein and pato @xcite used the maximum entropy principle to construct `` deformed '' random - matrix ensembles by imposing different constraints for the diagonal and off - diagonal elements .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to the case of metal - insulator transition@xcite .",
    "a recent review of the deformed ensemble is given in @xcite .",
    "ensembles of band random matrices , whose entries are equal to zero outside a band of limited width along the principal diagonal , have often been used to model mixed systems @xcite . however , so far in the literature , there is no rigorous statistical description for the transition from integrability to chaos .",
    "the field remains open for new proposals .",
    "the past decade has witnessed a considerable interest devoted to the possible generalization of statistical mechanics .",
    "much work in this direction followed tsallis seminal paper @xcite .",
    "tsallis introduced a non - extensive entropy , which depends on a positive parameter@xmath3 known as the entropic index .",
    "the standard shannon entropy is recovered for @xmath4 = 1 .",
    "applications of the tsallis formalism covered a wide class of phenomena ; for a review please see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "recently , the formalism has been applied to include systems with mixed regular - chaotic dynamics in the framework of rmt @xcite .",
    "this is done by extremizing tsallis non - extensive entropy , rather than shannon s , but again subject to the same constraints of normalization and existence of the expectation value of tr@xmath5 . the latter constraint preserves base invariance .",
    "the first attempt in this direction is probably due to evans and michael @xcite .",
    "toscano et al .",
    "@xcite constructed non - gaussian ensemble by minimizing tsallis entropy and obtained expressions for the level densities and spacing distributions for mixed systems belonging to the orthogonal - symmetry universality class .",
    "bertuola et al .",
    "@xcite expressed the spectral fluctuation in the subextensive regime in terms of the gap function , which measures the probability of an eigenvalue - free segment in the spectrum . a slightly different application of non - extensive statistical mechanics to rmt is due to nobre et al . @xcite .",
    "the nearest - neighbor - spacing ( nns ) distributions obtained in this approach decays as a power - law for large spacings .",
    "such anomalous distributions can hardly be used to interpolate between nearly - regular systems which have almost exponential nns distributions and nearly - chaotic ones whose distributions behave at large spacing as gaussians . moreover , the constraints of normalization and existence of an expectation value for tr@xmath6 set up an upper limit for the entropic index @xmath4 beyond which the involved integrals diverge .",
    "this restricts the validity of the non - extensive rmt to a limited range  near the chaotic phase @xcite .",
    "another extension of statistical mechanics is provided by the formalism of superstatistics ( statistics of a statistics ) , recently proposed by beck and cohen @xcite .",
    "superstatistics arises as weighted averages of ordinary statistics ( the boltzmann factor ) due to fluctuations of one or more intensive parameter ( e.g. the inverse temperature ) .",
    "it includes tsallis non - extensive statistics , for @xmath7 , as a special case in which the inverse temperature has a @xmath8-distributions . with other distributions of the intensive parameters ,",
    "one comes to other more general superstatistics .",
    "generalized entropies , which are analogous to the tsallis entropy , can be defined for these general superstatistics @xcite .",
    "this formalism has been elaborated and applied successfully to a wide variety of physical problems , e.g. , in @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite ,",
    "the concept of superstatistics was applied to model a mixed system within the framework of rmt .",
    "the joint matrix element distribution was represented as an average over @xmath9   $ ] with respect to the parameter @xmath10 .",
    "an expression for the eigenvalue distributions was deduced .",
    "explicit analytical results were obtained for the special case of two - dimensional random matrix ensembles .",
    "different choices of parameter distribution , which had been studied in beck and cohen s paper @xcite were considered .",

    "the distribution of local mean level densities is estimated by applying the principle of maximum entropy , as done by sattin @xcite . in section 2",
    "we briefly review the superstatistics concept and introduce the necessary generalization required to express the characteristics of the spectrum of a mixed system into an ensemble of chaotic spectra with different local mean level density .",
    "the evolution of the eigenvalue distribution during the stochastic transition induced by increasing the local - density fluctuations is considered in section 3 .",
    "the corresponding nns distributions are obtained in section 4 for systems in which the time - reversal symmetry is conserved or violated .",
    "section 5 considers the two - level correlation functions .",
    "the conclusion of this work is formulated in section 6 .",
    "to start with , we briefly review the superstatistics concept as introduced by beck and cohen @xcite . consider a non - equilibrium system with spatiotemporal fluctuations of the inverse temperature @xmath11 .",
    "locally , i.e. in spatial regions ( cells ) where @xmath11 is approximately constant , the system may be described by a canonical ensemble in which the distribution function is given by the boltzmann factor @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is an effective energy in each cell . in the long - term run ,",
    "the system is described by an average over the fluctuating @xmath11 .",
    "the system is thus characterized by a convolution of two statistics , and hence the name superstatistics .",
    "one statistics is given by the boltzmann factor and the other one by the probability distribution @xmath14 of @xmath11 in the various cells .",
    "one obtains tsallis statistics when @xmath11 has a @xmath8 distribution , but this is not the only possible choice .",
    "beck and cohen give several possible examples of functions which are possible candidates for @xmath14 .",
    "sattin @xcite suggested that , lacking any further information , the most probable realization of @xmath14 will be the one that maximizes the shannon entropy .",
    "namely this version of superstatistics formalism will now be applied to rmt .",
    "gaussian random - matrix ensembles have several common features with the canonical ensembles . in rmt",
    ", the square of a matrix element plays the role of energy of a molecule in a gas .",
    "when the matrix elements are statistically identical , one expects them to become distributed as the boltzmann s .",
    "one obtains a gaussian probability density distribution of the matrix elements @xmath15\\ ] ] by extremizing the shannon entropy @xcite subjected to the constraints of normalization and existence of the expectation value of tr@xmath5 .",
    "the quantity  tr@xmath6  plays the role of the effective energy of the system , while the role of the inverse temperature @xmath11 is played by @xmath10 , being twice the inverse of the matrix - element variance .",
    "our main assumption is that beck and cohen s superstatistics provides a suitable description for systems with mixed regular - chaotic dynamics .",
    "we consider the spectrum of a mixed system as made up of many smaller cells that are temporarily in a chaotic phase .",
    "each cell is large enough to obey the statistical requirements of rmt but has a different distribution parameter @xmath10 associated with it , according to a probability density @xmath16 .",
    "consequently , the superstatistical random - matrix ensemble that describes the mixed system is a mixture of gaussian ensembles .",

    "the distribution @xmath17 has to be normalizable , to have at least a finite first moment @xmath20 and to be reduces a delta function as the system becomes fully chaotic .    the random - matrix distribution  in eq .",
    "( 2 ) is invariant under base transformation because it depends on the hamiltonian matrix elements through the base - invariant quantity  tr@xmath5 .",
    "factorization into products of individual element distributions is lost here , unlike in the distribution functions of the standard rmt and most of its generalizations for mixed systems .",
    "the matrix elements are no more statistically independent .",
    "this handicaps one in carrying numerical calculations by the random - number generation of ensembles and forces one to resort to artificial methods as done in @xcite .",
    "base invariance makes the proposed random - matrix formalism unsuitable for description of nearly integrable systems .",
    "these systems are often described by an ensemble of diagonal matrices in a presumably fixed basis .",
    "for this reason we expect the present superstatistical approach to describe only the final stages of the stochastic transition .",
    "the base invariant theory in the proposed form does not address the important problem of symmetry breaking in a chaotic system , where the initial state is modelled by a block diagonal matrix with @xmath21 blocks , each of which is a goe @xcite .",
    "this problem is well described using deformed random - matrix ensembles as in @xcite or phenomenologically by considering the corresponding spectra as superpositions of independent sub - spectra , each represented by a goe @xcite .",
    "the physics behind the proposed superstatistical generalization of rmt is the following .",
    "the eigenstates of a chaotic system are extended and cover the whole domain of classically permitted motion randomly , but uniformly .",
    "they overlap substantially , as manifested by level repulsion .",
    "there are no preferred eigenstate ; the states are statistically equivalent . as a result ,",
    "the matrix elements of the hamiltonian  in any basis are independently but identically distributed , which leads to the wigner - dyson statistics .",
    "coming out of the chaotic phase , the extended eigenstates become less and less homogeneous in space .",
    "different eigenstates become localized in different places and the matrix elements that couple different pairs are no more statistically equal .",
    "the matrix elements will no more have the same variance ; one has to allow each of them to have its own variance . but",
    "this will dramatically increase the number of parameters of the theory .",
    "the proposed superstatistical approach solves this problem by treating all of the matrix elements as having a common variance , not fixed but fluctuating .",
    "the matrix - element distribution is not directly useful in obtaining numerical results concerning energy - level statistics such as the nearest - neighbor spacing distribution , the two - point correlation function , the spectral rigidity , and the level - number variance .",
    "these quantities are presumably obtainable from the eigenvalue distribution . from ( 1 ) , it is a simple matter  to set up the eigenvalue distribution of a gaussian ensemble . with @xmath22 , where @xmath23  is the global unitary group , we introduce the elements of the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues @xmath24 diag@xmath25 of the eigenvalues and the independent elements of @xmath23 as new variables",

    "similar relations can be obtained for any statistic @xmath35 with @xmath36  that can be obtained from @xmath37  by integration over the eigenvalues @xmath38 .    in practice",
    ", one has a spectrum consisting of a series of levels @xmath39 and is interested in their fluctuation properties . in order to bypass the effect of the level density variation ,",
    "one introduces the so called unfolded spectrum  @xmath40 , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the local mean level spacing .",
    "thus , the mean level density of the unfolded spectrum is unity . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy scale for a gaussian random - matrix ensemble is defined by the parameter @xmath43 the mean level spacing may be expressed as@xmath44 where @xmath45 is a constant depending on the size of the ensemble . therefore , although the parameter @xmath10 is the basic parameter of rmt , it is more convenient for practical purposed to consider the local mean spacing @xmath42 itself instead of @xmath10 as the fluctuating variable for which superstatistics has to be established",
    ".    the new framework of rmt provided by superstatistics should now be clear .",
    "the local mean spacing @xmath42 is no longer a fixed parameter but it is a stochastic variable with probability distribution @xmath46 . instead , the the observed mean level spacing is just its expectation value . the fluctuation of the local mean spacing is due to the correlation of the matrix elements which disappears for chaotic systems . in the absence of these fluctuations , @xmath47 and we obtain the standard rmt . within the superstatistics framework , we can express  any statistic @xmath48 of a mixed system that can in principle be  obtained from the joint eigenvalue distribution by integration over some of the eigenvalues , in terms of the corresponding statistic @xmath49 for a gaussian random ensemble .",
