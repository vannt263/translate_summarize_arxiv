    "the einstein theory of gravitational interactions appears to be strongly coupled at planck scale and is well known to be perturbatively non renormalizable  @xcite . therefore , as a quantum theory , is generally considered to be an effective one , nevertheless useful to compute quantum corrections  @xcite induced by graviton exchanges in low energy processes . at high energies it is generally believed to derive from a fundamental counterpart such as string theory or to be possibly described in terms of spin foams or lattice models .",
    "there have been also proposal that gravity may be induced  @xcite by other degrees of freedom , e.g. matter ones , and recently that gravitational field equations may be derived as thermodinamic properties  @xcite . even in this latter scenario where gravity is considered emergent",
    "we expect the presence , apart from matter quantum fluctuations , of quantum fluctuations of the gravitational degrees of freedom  @xcite , which may therefore be described in some domain by an effective qft .",
    "the higgs sector of the standard model is also regarded as an effective field theory since it can not be arbitrarily extended to ultraviolet ( uv ) energies .",
    "this is related to the triviality problem which manifests itself even in perturbation theory due to the appearence of a landau pole when studying the renormalized self - interaction of the higgs field .    in the context of qft",
    "there is nevertheless the possibility to have an uv complete description of the gravitational and standard model theories , so that they could be considered _ fundamental_. the paradigm of _ asymptotic safety _ has been introduced to provide such a situation , which is realized whenever the renormalization group ( rg ) analysis of the theory reveals the existence of a fixed point ( fp ) with a finite number of uv attractive ( relevant ) directions in the theory space  @xcite .",
    "analytical tools for the investigations of rg flows of qft models in the wilsonian sense  @xcite , leading to functional renormalization group equations  @xcite are available . in particular increasing evidence that gravity might be asymptotically safe ( and therefore a meaningful qft )",
    "comes from the analysis of effective average action ( eaa ) truncations which include terms associated to the einstein - hilbert and cosmological constant  @xcite , and then scalar matter minimally or non minimally coupled @xcite , quartic and higher derivative terms of the metric  @xcite , free matter of all spin less than two  @xcite .    on the other hand , the possibility that asymptotic safety can solve the triviality as well as",
    "the hierarchy problem in the standard model and in particular in the higgs sector has been recently explored .",
    "several models for interacting scalar - fermion matter have been considered , starting from the most simple ones , both in the symmetric and in the ssb phases  @xcite .",
    "the simplest model does not show the possibility to have non trivial fps but for models of increasing complexity there exists a range of parameters suitable for asymptotic safety to be realized .",
    "in this letter we report and discuss the results of a study of einstein gravity interacting with the simplest possible system with one scalar field and @xmath0 dirac fermions with a @xmath1 symmetric yukawa interaction , which by itself has been found to be a non asymptotic safe theory .",
    "the investigations on such a system started in @xcite .",
    "for a pertubative approach at one loop with dimensional regularization see also  @xcite .",
    "the goal is twofold .",
    "on one hand we would like to see if the inclusion of such an interacting matter can spoil the formation of the non trivial fp structure in the gravity sector . in doing this",
    "we also consider for the first time the anomalous dimensions of the matter fields , which have been previously neglected in all asymptotic safety studies which include gravity . on the other hand",
    "we want to analyze if in this simplified model the gravitational interaction leads to the possibility to have an asymptotically safe matter sector , eventually removing the triviality problem in the scalar sector .",
    "this might serve as a prelude for a more general analysis involving the higgs , fermion and gauge fields of the standard model .",
    "there is the possibility that the uv completion of such a theory together with gravity might be realized in a satisfactory way in the qft sense .",
    "this would constitute an alternative to considering a scenario were these theories emerge at low energy from superstring theories or other viable gut .",
    "we adopt wilson s approach to renormalization and introduce an euclidean eaa with a scale dependence .",
    "we truncate it to the form _ k & = & ^4 x ( l_b+l_f+l_g ) where the single terms are l_b & = & z_^_+v ( ) [ scalar action ] + l_f & = & z_(|^d_-d_|^ ) + ih()| ) [ spinor action ] + l_g & = & - z r [ gravitational action ] the multiplet @xmath2 contains all the dynamical fields .",
    "@xmath3 is a sliding renormalization scale that parameterizes the rg flow of the eaa .",
    "the newton constant is contained in @xmath4 , while the cosmological constant is the zero point energy of the potential @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath6 is a generalized yukawa interaction .",
    "the spinor covariant derivative is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the spin connection and @xmath9 $ ] are the @xmath10 generators .",
    "we use the background field method in conjunction to exact renormalization group .",
    "the action is expanded around a background @xmath11 using fluctuations @xmath12 and define _ k & = & _ k+ l_g.f.+l_gh we add a gauge fixing term for the diffeomorphisms and a corresponding ghost action & & l_g.f.= g^f_f _  ; f_=(_^^-g^ _ ) h _ + & & l_gh=|c_(-g^^2 + ^^-r _ ) c _  .",
    "notice that we included the ghosts in the fluctuations multiplet .",

    "the apex numbers @xmath15 indicate that two functional derivatives w.r.t .",
    "the first argument were taken .",
    "the flow of the eaa is governed by the exact rg equation ( erge )  @xcite k_k _ k & = & _ k _ k = [ erge ] where the dot means @xmath16 derivative and @xmath17 is a reference scale ; @xmath18 .",
    "we require the cutoff kernel to be a function of the background metric @xmath19 only , i.e. @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "in particular , the cutoff is required to be a function of the operators @xmath21 and @xmath22 , so that any covariant derivative appearing in @xmath23 $ ] is coarse - grained by @xmath20 $ ] .",
    "the profile function of the cutoff is always the optimized one  @xcite , @xmath24 , for @xmath25 , and allows to perform exacty the trace .",

    "all this , apart for a slightly different choice of the cutoff scheme , goes along the lines of our previous work  @xcite . in order to calculate the flow of @xmath31 and @xmath32 , we take two functional derivatives of ( [ erge ] ) with respect to @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that @xmath35 .",

    "the anomalous dimensions are defined as @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "we use ( [ erge2 ] ) in the background @xmath28 , @xmath40 , @xmath30 and then move to momentum space .",
    "additionally , we require @xmath41 to simplify to some extent . choosing in ( [ erge2 ] ) @xmath42 , or @xmath43 and @xmath44 , we calculate @xmath45 and @xmath46 , isolating the coefficients of the operators @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . @xmath45 and @xmath46 calculated in this way are _ on - shell _ and have a @xmath49 dependence that has to be fixed by physical requirements .    the running @xmath50 is calculated using heat kernel methods .",
    "we set the background to be a @xmath51-sphere with corresponding metric and choose @xmath28 and @xmath40 .",

    "the details of these partial differential equations , and of @xmath56 , @xmath45 and @xmath46 will be given elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "now we truncate further @xmath67 and @xmath68 to get a finite system of ordinary differential equations .",

    "a @xmath70-symmetric phase is analyzed through the expansion @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath74 , we are in a symmetry breaking regime and expand @xmath75 . the crucial difference of the latter regime is that the running of the vev @xmath76 is determined by the requirement @xmath77 . in general the vev beta function acquires gravitational correction only through the anomalous dimensions of matter fields : = -(2 + _ ) + -|_|_r= we further consider a simple yukawa interaction according to @xmath78 . in both phases , with truncations up to fourth order in the scalar potential , the rg flow is encoded in a system of 5 odes .",
    "we mainly considered them in the dedonder gauge ( @xmath79 , @xmath80 ) but investigated also other choices .",
    "let us present the fp structure for the _ symmetric phase _ , which depends on the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "in particular we find the expected fully gaussian ( gfp ) as well as the gaussian matter fixed points ( gmfp ) , that exists for any value of @xmath0 .",

    "the ultraviolet critical surface has dimension @xmath51 ( but @xmath83 for the fully gaussian case for @xmath84 ) .",
    "moreover we find the existence of a fully non trivial fp for @xmath85 , with small anomalous dimensions .",
    "the dimension of the uv critical surface is always @xmath83 , independently of @xmath0 .",
    "we present in table @xmath86 few examples of fp and the asymptotic behavior @xmath87 .",

    "position of the non trivial fixed point , the critical exponents and the matter field anomalous dimensions for varying @xmath0 and their asymptotic values .",
    "the asymptotic constants have been determined analytically  @xcite .",
    "the non trivial fixed point approaches the gmfp in the limit @xmath89 .",
    "we also considered scalar potential truncations with higher order polinomials .",
    "the shape of the potential at the fp changes very little and the fp exists with negligible variations for @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 for all values of @xmath0 .",
    "moreover the matter field anomalous dimensions appear to be small and so we expect the truncation to be reliable .",
    "there is little sensitivity with respect to the choice of the cufoff function , as was already discussed in  @xcite . adopting a pure cutoff scheme , where even the field strength of the fields is not included in @xmath37 , is leading to very similar results .",
    "moreover we have observed a very good stability of the results on changing the gauge parameters @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the dependence on the latter is due to the offshellness of the flat space background choice and to the truncation employed in .",
    "we consider now the _ ssb phase _ with a non zero scalar vev .",
    "the numerical search for the fps has revealed five @xmath0-dependent families of solutions . there is a ( generalized ) gmfp solution ( @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) with @xmath82 and tipically @xmath97 and uv critical dimension @xmath51 .",
    "another solution exists for @xmath98 and has @xmath99 , small anomalous dimensions and is completely uv repulsive .",
    "the other three solutions , completely non trivial , are characterized by at least one large anomalous dimension and therefore are not very appealing .",
    "we have computed , using functional renormalization group techniques , quantum corrections in a special but non trivial interacting gravity matter system , taking into account the anomalous dimensions of the matter fields ( one scalar and @xmath0 dirac fermions ) .",
    "the results we obtained corroborate the scenario of an asymptotically safe gravity .",
    "a non trivial fp in the gravitational sector is realized as gmfp , independently of the cutoff schemes used in both symmetric and broken phases .",
    "moreover we find that in the symmetric phase another fp exists , completely non trivial , i.e. with non constant scalar potential @xmath67 and non zero yukawa coupling associated to a three dimensional critical surface .",
    "such a point is stable under different polynomial expansions of the local scalar potential and change of the gauge fixing parameters .",
    "we found that , when neglecting the anomalous dimensions , this fp exists for @xmath100 , with couplings of the same order of magnitude , and that another non trivial one appears , with much larger values and a different @xmath0 asymptotic dependence .",
    "the lesson we learn is that , in general , anomalous dimensions should be taken into account as this might be crucial to determine the correct fp structure . in the broken phase",
    "several non trivial fp solutions appears , but due to their large anomalous dimensions we do not consider them physically trustable .    in the previous sections we studied in detail the rg flow adopting a type - i cutoff scheme . in such a scheme , for @xmath101 scalar ,",
    "@xmath102 dirac fermions and @xmath103 massless vector fields , the gravitational @xmath94 function acquires a leading term proportional to @xmath104 @xcite . another often used scheme ( type - ii ) is such that the same contribution is proportional to @xmath105 . the contribution to the vacuum energy",
    "is the same , proportional to @xmath106 in both schemes @xcite . studying the rg flow of our simple model using the type - ii cutoff",
    "one finds that , for any @xmath0 , the non trivial fp disappears .",
    "however it is clear that this feature may change when introducing a more realistic matter sector . as a preliminary test we considered our simplified toy model with additional free scalar , dirac fermion and vector fields . having in mind to keep a yukawa coupling for the top quark only , which belongs to a fundamental representation of @xmath107 , we set @xmath108 and the number of the other free fields to match the content of the standard model . repeating the rg flow analysis , we found for both cutoff type schemes ( i and ii ) a non trivial fp .",
    "this fp is non trivial , both in the gravitational and in the interacting scalar - fermion sector and has a yukawa coupling with value about unity .",
    "the non trivial fp exists also when changing the number of the extra free fields around the values corresponding to the standard model content , for a wide range of parameters .",
    "we observe that tipically it has a negative value @xmath90 , which nevertheless may change sign in the rg flow towards the ir .",
    "an analysis of the influence of free fields on the gravitational fp with type - i cutoff was previously presented in  @xcite .",
    "details of our analysis will be given in  @xcite .",
    "in a scenario with an asymptotically safe gravity , there has been a proposal to predict the higgs boson mass  @xcite .",
    "negative gravitational corrections to the top yukawa beta function were required . however ,",
    "if we expand perturbatively our results and retain the leading order , we find a negative gravitational contribution to the fermion anomalous dimensions , but a positive gravity - induced term to the yukawa beta function , @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "it is intriguing that in the symmetric phase we get a fully non trivial fp solution with a yukawa coupling value around unity , which is close to the top yukawa one at low energies .",
    "one may imagine a scenario with a modest flow of the yukawa coupling from uv ( ultra planckian ) to ir ( fermi ) scales .",
    "nevertheless , one should include a mechanism to obtain a low energy ssb phase . on the other hand a full investigation of a situation closer to the standard model",
    "might reveal the possibility that a trustable non trivial fixed point is realized even in an higgs ssb phase .",
    "we plan to study and discuss more these issues elsewhere .",
