    "non - perturbative phenomena of qcd such as confinement can be explored using monte carlo simulations of lattice gauge theory .",
    "the potential @xmath5 between two static quarks at separation @xmath6 in quenched qcd is one of the simplest manifestations of confinement and has been studied intensively . at large @xmath6 the potential rises linearly as predicted by the hadronic string model .",
    "one can also measure the spatial distribution of the colour fields around such static quarks in order to get a detailed picture of the confining flux tube . in ref .",
    "@xcite , which contains references to earlier work , this was done for the ground state and the first excited state of the two - quark potential , having the symmetries of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 representations , respectively , of the lattice symmetry group @xmath9 .",
    "transverse and longitudinal profiles of chromoelectric and -magnetic fields were compared with vibrating string and dual qcd models for the flux tube , with the latter model reproducing quite well the shape of the energy profile measured on a lattice . instead of su(3 ) , the gauge group used was su(2 ) , which is more manageable with present - day computer resources and is expected to have very similar features of confinement .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the flux - tube models considered do not distinguish between su(2 ) and su(3 ) .",
    "the method used to study the colour fields on a lattice is to measure the correlation of a plaquette @xmath10 with the wilson loop @xmath11 that represents the static quark and antiquark at separation @xmath6 .",
    "when the plaquette is located at @xmath12 in the @xmath13 plane , the following expression isolates , in the limit @xmath14 , the contribution of the colour field at position @xmath15 : @xmath16.\\ ] ]    in the naive continuum limit these contributions are related to the mean squared fluctuation of the minkowski colour fields by @xmath17 when the interquark separation axis is chosen as the 1-axis the squares of the longitudinal and transverse electric and magnetic fields can be identified as @xmath18 these can then be combined naively to give the action density @xmath19 and the energy density @xmath20 of the gluon field .    since in this work",
    "we use a plaquette to probe the colour flux , the spatial size of the probe will decrease as the lattice spacing @xmath21 . to define a continuum limit of the colour flux distributions , one would have to use a probe of a fixed physical size as @xmath22 . in this work",
    "we wish to compare flux distributions at different lattice spacing .",
    "one special tool that is available , when a plaquette is used to probe the colour flux with the wilson gauge action , is that exact identities can be derived for the integrals over all space of the flux distributions .",
    "these sum rules  @xcite relate spatial sums of the colour fields measured using eq .",
    "[ fmnt ] to the static potential @xmath5 via generalised @xmath2-functions , which show how the bare couplings of the theory vary with the generalised lattice spacings @xmath23 in four directions .",
    "one can think of these sum rules as providing the appropriate anomalous dimension for the colour flux sums .",
    "this normalises the colour flux and provides a guide for comparing colour flux distributions measured at different @xmath24-values .",
    "the full set of sum rules  @xcite allow these generalised @xmath2-functions to be determined at just one @xmath2-value  ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . here",
    "we investigate this further by comparing estimates at two different @xmath2-values .",
    "this can also help to clear up some inconsistencies between the @xmath2-function determination from the sum rules at one @xmath2-value  @xcite and other methods @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite the simulations were carried out at @xmath25 with a @xmath26 lattice . here",
    "results from similar computations at @xmath27 with a @xmath28 lattice are reported .",
    "most of the simulation and analysis techniques , such as use of a variational basis with different fuzzing levels , are the same and can be found from ref . @xcite .",
    "in addition to more accurate measurements of flux - tube profiles , we also present estimates of @xmath2-functions at both @xmath25 and 2.5 .    in sect",

    "3 the corresponding flux tube profiles calculated . in sect .",
    "4 , @xmath5 and the profiles are related by sum rules and various estimates of the @xmath2-function are made .",
    "some conclusions are made in sect .",
    "we construct lattice operators to create and destroy states with two static quarks at separation @xmath6 joined by gluonic paths which represent the colour flux .",
    "the techniques we use to make efficient operators with a large overlap with the ground state are described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in order to improve the signal we applied `` fuzzing '' , where each spatial link is replaced by a weighted sum of itself and its surrounding spatial staples , before the correlations were measured .",
    "to investigate gluonic excitations and minimize their contribution to the ground state signal we need a variational basis , which was obtained by performing the measurements on lattices with different levels of fuzzing .    at @xmath29 fuzzing levels 40 , 16 , 0 and 40 , 13 , 2 , respectively , formed the variational basis in the case of paths with @xmath7 symmetry .",
    "a three - state basis may be expected to give a reasonable signal for the @xmath30 excitation by reducing the contamination from higher excitations with this symmetry . for paths with @xmath8 symmetry the fuzzing levels 16 ,",
    "13 were used for the two @xmath2 s with two different transverse extents of the paths forming a variational basis .",
    "these transverse extents were one and two lattice spacings for small longitudinal lengths and one and four lattice spacings for larger @xmath6 s . in order to set the scale , the lattice steps @xmath31 and @xmath32 were determined by fitting the two - body parameterisation @xmath33_l + b_s r + v_0 \\label{ev}\\ ] ] to measured potentials at interquark separations @xmath34 , @xmath35 at @xmath1 respectively . here",
    "@xmath36_l$ ] is the latticized form of the coulomb potential @xmath37 due to one - gluon exchange .",
    "the above range of @xmath6 was chosen to correspond to similar physical distance ranges .",
    "the usual method for estimating the lattice spacing is to equate the dimensionless value of @xmath38 from the fit of eq .",
    "[ ev ] to an experimental value .",
    "this is equivalent to utilizing @xmath5 in the limit @xmath39 .",
    "however , our experimental knowledge of the two - quark potential comes from heavy mesons with r.m.s .",
    "radii around 1 fm .",
    "an alternative method due to sommer @xcite compares the force from @xmath5 to experimental values at a distance range more appropriate to these mesons , i.e. @xmath40 fm . in practice the equation @xmath41 is used to find @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the force between two static quarks at separation @xmath44 .",
    "various nonrelativistic continuum potential models give @xmath45 fm for @xmath46 and @xmath47 fm for @xmath48 @xcite .",
    "the resulting scales and ratios of lattice spacings @xmath49 are shown in table [ tscale ] .",
    "the values of @xmath50 from @xmath38 and sommer s scheme are seen to agree .",

    "in this paper the spatial distribution and nature of the electric and magnetic colour fields between two quarks are measured for @xmath25 and @xmath51 .",
    "we discuss carefully the theoretical expectations for scaling versus @xmath2 of these distributions and compare with our results . for the observables with a well - controlled continuum limit ( three - dimensional sums ) , scaling is investigated and found to be good in most cases of interest . for more differential observables ( transverse sums and -profiles ) the changes seen between the two values of @xmath2 can be explained qualitatively from the discretisation : the plateaux stay the same , while the peaks get higher for smaller @xmath24 .",
    "self - energies , as measured by transverse plane sums , diverge in a manner suggested by leading order perturbation theory , with the divergence being faster in the @xmath52 case because of the longitudinal extent of the plaquettes measuring the dominant electric field . by comparing various combinations of the spatial sums of the @xmath53 fields with the interquark potential @xmath54 , estimates can be made of the generalised @xmath2-functions @xmath55 and",
    "@xmath56  see eqs .",
    "[ tasu][tepsu ] .",
    "there are two problems that prevent the direct use of these equations .",
    "firstly , since the whole calculation is performed on a lattice , @xmath5 is only known at discrete values of @xmath6 , so that the values of @xmath57 can not be measured directly .",
    "secondly , both @xmath5 and the spatial sums have self - action or -energy contributions .",
    "to minimize or avoid these problems the extraction of @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be carried out in different ways each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages concerning statistical and systematical errors .    the most direct approach ",
    "method 1 of subsection [ sm1 ]  is to parameterize @xmath5 so that @xmath58 can be readily calculated .",
    "this overcomes the @xmath58 problem at the expense of some systematic error introduced by the form of parameterisation of @xmath5 used . by plotting , as a function of @xmath6 , @xmath59 versus the various spatial sums ,",
    "the slopes give immediately @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "this resulted in @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath56 was much more uncertain when the two sum rules  one involving @xmath62 and the other @xmath63  were used separately . when these two sum rules were fitted simultaneously , a better result emerged , @xmath64 and @xmath65 . already at this stage",
    ", it could be seen that the data causing most of these uncertainties are those involving the longitudinal energy @xmath66 especially for @xmath27 .",
    "one way to avoid the @xmath58 and self - action and -energy problems is to combine the original three sum rules in such a way as to eliminate the problems  see eqs .",
    "[ eb][ef ] for method 2 .",
    "however , in spite of the ideal form of these equations they result in poor estimates of both @xmath55 and @xmath56 . for @xmath25 , @xmath55 and @xmath56",
    "agree with method 1 but with large statistical errors  see fig .",
    "[ fb ] a ) .",
    "but for @xmath27 the values of @xmath55 tend to be too low and of @xmath56 too high  both with large error bars .",
    "these differences can be directly attributed to the inaccuracy of the data for @xmath62 .",
    "the third method for extracting @xmath55 and @xmath56 exploits the form expected of @xmath5 and the flux tube profiles in the limit @xmath67 from string models .",
    "when a continuum parameterisation of @xmath5 is used and two @xmath6 values are subtracted , the sum rules reduce to those in eqs .",
    "[ elrb][elrf2 ] and these yield results consistent with those of method 1 , but with larger statistical errors .",
    "in the large @xmath6 limit , a further approximation is to replace the flux tube profile by one that is constant between the quarks ( @xmath68 ) and dropping to zero rapidly for @xmath69 and @xmath70 . at the largest @xmath6 s the results are consistent with method 1 , but with large statistical errors .",
    "these results are only very weakly dependent on the point where the profile drops to zero beyond the positions of the quarks .",
    "as seen in tables [ tb ] and [ tcf ] , our best estimates for @xmath55 and @xmath56 agree with other recent non - perturbative estimates , most importantly the finite temperature approach of ref .",
    "it thus seems safe to conclude that order @xmath71 effects in the extraction of the @xmath2-function are small at the @xmath2-values studied using the methods described .",
    "thus we have a unique non - perturbative @xmath2-function which describes the deviations from asymptotic scaling at these values of the coupling .    for the state with @xmath30 symmetry ,",
    "our data shows the existence of a dip in the action and transverse energy distributions away from the centre of the flux - tube in the transverse plane between the quarks .",
    "this qualitatively confirms the prediction of the isgur - paton flux - tube model for the energy distribution .",
    "no such node is seen for the longitudinal energy , and for the action it is more pronounced in the transverse component .    in the future",
    "we plan to study four - body flux distributions and their relationship to two - body flux - tubes .",
    "sum rules will be used verify the correctness of the measured distributions .",
