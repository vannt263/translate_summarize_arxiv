    "in this work , we analyze and apply the recent misc method @xcite to the approximation of quantities of interest ( outputs ) from the solutions of linear elliptic partial differential equations ( pdes ) with random coefficients .",
    "such equations arise in many applications in which the coefficients of the pde are described in terms of random variables / fields due either to a lack of knowledge of the system or to its inherent non - predictability .",
    "we focus on the weak approximation of the solution of the following linear elliptic @xmath0-parametric problem : @xmath1 here , @xmath2 with @xmath3 denotes the `` physical domain '' , and the operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 act with respect to the physical variable , @xmath6 , only .",
    "we assume that @xmath7 has a tensor structure , i.e. , @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , see , e.g. , figures  [ subf - bsq ] and  [ subf - cyl ] .",
    "this assumption simplifies the analysis detailed in the following , although misc can be applied to more general domains , such as    * domains obtained by mapping from a reference tensor domain as in figure  [ subf - lean - cyl ] , by suitably extending the approaches in @xcite ; * non - tensor domains that can be immersed in a tensor bounding box , @xmath12 , as in figure  [ subf - nont ] , whose mesh is obtained as a tensor product of meshes on each component , @xmath13 , of the bounding box ; * domains that admit a structured mesh , i.e. , with a regular connectivity , whose level of refinement in each `` direction '' can be set independently , as in figure  [ subf - struct ] ; * domains that can be decomposed in patches satisfying any of the conditions above ( observe that the meshes on each patch need not be conforming ) .     +    the parameter @xmath14 in is a random sequence whose components are independent and uniformly distributed random variables .",
    "more precisely , each @xmath15 has support in @xmath16 $ ] with measure @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the standard lebesgue measure .",
    "we further define @xmath19 $ ] ( hereafter referred to as the `` stochastic domain '' or the `` parameter space '' ) , with the cylindrical probability measure @xmath20 , ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 3 , section 5 ) ) .",
    "the right - hand side of , namely the deterministic function @xmath21 , does not play a central role in this work and it is assumed to be a smooth function of class @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the closure of @xmath7 .",
    "this regularity requirement can be relaxed , but we keep it to ease the presentation , since our main goal in this work is to track the effect of the regularity of the coefficient @xmath24 in on the misc convergence rate . here , we focus on the following family of diffusion coefficients : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a sequence of functions @xmath27 for @xmath28 such that @xmath29 as @xmath30 . hereafter , without loss of generality , we assume that the sequence @xmath31 is ordered in decreasing order . thanks to a straightforward application of the lax - milgram lemma , the well - posedness of in the classical sobolev space , @xmath32 , is guaranteed almost surely ( a.s . ) in @xmath33 if two functions , @xmath34 , exist such that @xmath35 moreover , the equation is well posed in the bochner space , @xmath36 , for some @xmath37 , , @xmath38 . ]",

    ", we consider a decomposition in terms of tensorized univariate details ( i.e. , a tensorized hierarchical decomposition ) , for both the discrete space in which is solved for a fixed value of @xmath45 and for the quadrature operator used to approximate the expected value of @xmath46 , relying on the well - established theory of sparse - grid approximation of pdes on the one hand @xcite and of sparse - grid quadrature on the other hand @xcite .",
    "we use tensor products of such univariate details , obtaining combined deterministic - stochastic , first - order mixed differences to build the misc estimator of @xmath47}}$ ] by selecting the most effective mixed differences with an optimization approach inspired by the literature on the knapsack problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the knapsack approach also was used in @xcite to obtain the so - called quasi - optimal sparse grids for pdes with stochastic coefficients and in @xcite in the context of sparse - grid resolution of high - dimensional pdes .",
    "the resulting method can be seen as an extension of the sparse - grid combination technique for pdes with stochastic coefficients , as well as a fully sparse , non - randomized version of the multilevel monte carlo method @xcite . in particular",
    ", misc differs from other works in the literature that attempt to optimally combine spatial and stochastic resolution levels @xcite in two aspects .",
    "first , misc uses combined deterministic - stochastic , first - order differences , which allows us to exploit not only the regularity of the solution with respect to the spatial variables and the stochastic parameters , but also the mixed deterministic - stochastic regularity whenever available .",
    "second , the misc estimator is built upon an optimization procedure , whereas the above - mentioned works try to balance the error contributions arising from the deterministic and stochastic components of the method without taking into account the corresponding costs . finally , misc can also be seen as a sparse - grid quadrature version of the multi - index monte carlo method that was proposed and analyzed in @xcite .    in @xcite ,",
    "misc was introduced in a general setting and we restricted the analysis to the case of problems of type depending on a _ finite _ number of random variables , @xmath48 , with @xmath49 . here",
    ", we provide a complexity analysis of misc in the more challenging case in which the diffusion coefficient @xmath24 depends on a countable sequence of random variables , @xmath50 .",
    "furthermore , we aim at tracking the dependence of the misc converge rate on the smoothness of the realizations of @xmath24 .",
    "this new framework requires that the tools used to prove the complexity of the method be changed : whereas in @xcite we used a `` direct counting '' argument , i.e. , we derived a complexity estimate by explicitly summing the work and the error contributions associated with each mixed difference included in the misc estimator , here we base our proof on a summability argument and on suitable interpolation estimates in mixed regularity spaces .",
    "we mention that in @xcite an infinite dimensional analysis based on a direct counting argument was recently carried out in the case of hyperbolic cross - type index sets that might arise when quasi - optimizing the work contribution of sparse grid stochastic collocation without spatial discretization .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s : functional_setting ] introduces suitable assumptions and a class of random diffusion coefficients that we consider throughout the work ; functional analysis results that are needed for the subsequent analysis of the misc method are also provided .",
    "the misc method is reviewed in section  [ s : misc - method ] .",
    "a complexity analysis of misc with an infinite number of random variables is carried out in section  [ s : err ] , where we provide a general convergence theorem . in section  [ s :",
    "example_analysis ] , we discuss the application of misc to the specific class of diffusion coefficients that we consider here and track the dependence of the convergence rate on the regularity of the diffusion coefficient . section  [ s : numerics ] presents some numerical tests to verify the convergence analysis conducted in the previous section .",
    "finally , section  [ s : conclusions ] provides some conclusions and final remarks . in the appendix",
    ", we include some technical results on the summability and regularity properties of certain random fields written in terms of their series expansion .    in the following",
    ", @xmath51 denotes the set of integer numbers including zero , while @xmath52 denotes the set of positive integer numbers excluding zero .",
    "we refer to sequences in @xmath53 and @xmath54 as `` multi - indices '' .",
    "moreover , we often use a vector notation for sequences , i.e. , we formally treat sequences as vectors in @xmath53 ( or @xmath55 ) and mark them with bold type .",
    "we employ the following notation , with the understanding that @xmath49 for actual vectors and @xmath56 for sequences :    * @xmath57 denotes a vector in @xmath58 whose components are all equal to one ; * @xmath59 denotes the @xmath60-th canonical vector in @xmath61 , i.e. , @xmath62 if @xmath63 and zero otherwise ; however , for the sake of clarity , we often omit the superscript @xmath64 whenever it is obvious from context .",
    "for instance , if @xmath65 , we write @xmath66 instead of @xmath67 ; * given @xmath65 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 denotes the number of non - zero components of @xmath70 , @xmath71 and @xmath72 ; * @xmath73 denotes the set of sequences with positive components with only finitely many elements larger than 1 , i.e. , @xmath74 ; * given @xmath65 and @xmath75 , @xmath76 denotes the vector obtained by applying @xmath77 to each component of @xmath70 , @xmath78 \\in { \\mathbb{r}}^n$ ] ; * given @xmath79 , the inequality @xmath80 holds true if and only if @xmath81 @xmath82 ; * given @xmath83 and @xmath84 , we denote their concatenation by @xmath85 = ( v_1,\\ldots , v_d , w_1,\\ldots , w_n ) \\in      { \\mathbb{r}}^{d+n}$ ] ; * given a set with finite cardinality , @xmath86 , we define the set @xmath87 .",

    "belong to more regular spaces to prove a convergence rate result for misc . more specifically ,",
    "due to the classic spatial sparse - grid approximation theory , we need certain conditions on the mixed derivatives of @xmath91 with respect to the physical coordinates . to this end",
    ", we introduce suitable functional spaces ( tensor products of fractional sobolev spaces , see also @xcite ) and then a `` shift '' regularity assumption ( see assumption  [ assump : shift ] below ) , i.e. , we assume that the regularity of the realizations of @xmath91 is induced `` in a natural way '' by the regularity of @xmath24 , of the forcing , @xmath21 , and of the smoothness of the physical domain , @xmath7 .",
    "in other words , we rule out `` pathological''/``ad hoc '' examples in which @xmath91 is very regular despite the data is not , e.g. , when the forcing is chosen such that @xmath92 for @xmath93 even in the presence of a domain with corners .",

    ". the tensorized fractional sobolev space can then be defined as @xmath99 for @xmath100 .",

    "instead , we will be content with deducing mixed regularity from inclusions in standard sobolev spaces , to the point that assumption  [ assump : shift ] will be written in terms of standard sobolev spaces .",
    "for this , we observe that @xmath107 holds and in general we have the following inclusion result between standard and mixed fractional sobolev spaces : @xmath108    before stating precisely the shift - regularity assumption on @xmath91 , we need some more notation and setup .",
    "first , observe that this assumption needs to be stated in the complex domain , for reasons that will be made clear later .",
