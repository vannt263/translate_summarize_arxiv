    "massive black holes in galactic nuclei are considered to have co - evolved with their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "since galaxies are well - known to evolve through frequent mergers , this strongly suggests that black hole growth is mainly caused by black hole mergers and subsequent accretion of gas @xcite .",
    "if so , a massive binary black hole ( bbh ) is inevitably formed before the black holes merge by emitting the gravitational radiation . even if there are transiently triple massive black holes in a galactic nucleus , the system finally settles down to the formation of the massive bbh by merging of two black hole or by ejecting one black hole from the system via a gravitational slingshot @xcite .",
    "recent hydrodynamic simulations showed the rapid bbh formation within several @xmath2 by the interaction between the black holes and the surrounding stars and gas in gas - rich galaxy merger @xcite .",
    "it is widely accepted that massive bbh mainly evolves via three stages @xcite .",
    "firstly , each black hole sinks independently towards the center of the common gravitational potential due to the dynamical friction with neighboring stars .",
    "when the separation between two black holes becomes less than @xmath3 or so , an angular momentum loss by the dynamical friction slows down due to the depletion of the stars on orbits intersecting the bbh @xcite .",
    "this is the second evolutionary stage . finally , the bbh coalesces rapidly if the semi - major axis decreases to the point where the emission of the gravitational radiation becomes an efficient mechanism to remove the orbital angular momentum of the bbh .",
    "the transition from the second stage to the final stage is , however , considered to be the bottleneck of evolutionary path for the bbh to coalesce because of cutting off the supply of the stars on intersecting orbits .",
    "this is called the final parsec problem ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "many authors have tackled the final parsec problem in the context of the interaction between the black holes and the stars , but there has been still extensive discussions @xcite .",
    "there is other possible way to extract the energy and the angular momentum from the bbh by the interaction between the black holes and the gas surrounding them . in some cases of circular binaries with extreme mass ratio",
    ", the secondary black hole could be embedded in the gas disk around the primary black hole and then migrates to the primary black hole .",
    "this kind of the binary - disk interaction could also be the candidate to resolve the final parsec problem @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that if the bbh is surrounded by the gaseous disk with the nearly keplerian rotation ( i.e. the circumbinary disk : cbd ) , the gas can be transferred from the cbd to each black hole .",
    "the mass transfer leads to the formation of the accretion disk around each black hole @xcite , and then the bbh system finally has the triple disks which are composed of the accretion disk around each black hole and one circumbinary disk surrounding them ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : system ] for a schematic view of the bbh system ) .",
    "there is , however , little known how the bbh evolves in such a triple - disk system .",
    "we , therefore , study the evolution of the massive bbh interacting with the triple disks .",
    "although we mainly discuss the case of a massive bbh system , our results can be applied to other possible context such as the compact binaries , the young binary star formation , and the extrasolar planet formation because of the scaling nature .",
    "the plan of this paper is organized as follows . in section  2 ,",
    "we describe the derivation of basic equations governing the orbital evolution of the bbh and the formulation of the gravitational torque of the bbh which acts on the cbd .",
    "the solutions for their evolutionary equations are , then , reported in section  3 .",
    "section  4 is devoted to discussions , and finally we summarize results in section  5 .",
    "we assume that two black hole are gravitationally bounded and their motions are followed by the kepler s third law , by which the bbh is defined .",
    "the total energy of the bbh @xmath4 is written by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the semi - major axis of the bbh and @xmath7 is the reduced mass of the bbh . here",
    ", @xmath8 is total black hole mass , @xmath9 is the primary black hole mass , and @xmath10 is the secondary black hole mass . by differentiating both sides of above equation , the energy dissipation rate of the orbital motion can be obtained as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the mass accretion rate of the primary black hole , @xmath13 is the mass accretion rate of the secondary black hole .",
    "the dot over each physical quantity shows the time differentiation , unless otherwise noted .",
    "the orbital angular momentum of the bbh @xmath14 is written by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the orbital eccentricity , @xmath17 is the angular frequency of the bbh .",
    "the relationship between the orbital energy @xmath4 and the orbital angular momentum @xmath14 can be written , from equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) and ( [ eq : jb ] ) , @xmath18 the change rate of the orbital angular momentum @xmath19 can be written as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the total mass - accretion rate .",
    "the orbital evolution of the bbh is generally governed by equations ( [ eq : energy])-([eq : jbdot ] ) . since the total mass accretion rate is much lower than the black hole mass , the second term and the third term in the right hand - side of equations ( [ eq : ebdot ] ) and ( [ eq : jbdot ] )",
    "can be neglected . actually , @xcite showed by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations that the mass accretion rate is two orders of magnitude lower than the mass transfer rate .",
    "therefore , a set of the basic equations of the orbital evolution is finally given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "we consider the resonant interaction between the bbh and the cbd .",
    "the cbd is assumed to be geometrically thin , be aligned with the orbital plane of the bbh , and have nearly keplerian rotation with no self - gravitation .",

    "the radii of these resonances for the cbd are given by @xmath34 and @xmath35 here , the epicyclic frequency @xmath36 for the nearly keplerian disks .",
    "the standard formula for toques at the lr is given by @xcite @xmath37 where @xmath38 . if @xmath39 , @xmath40 for the olr in the cbd ( cf .",
    "similarly , the torque at the cr is written as @xmath41 note that the angular momentum is added from the binary to the cbd via the lrs and the cr . on the other hand ,",
    "the viscous torque formula derived by @xcite is written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter @xcite .",
    "since the viscous torque removes the angular momentum from the cbd , the cbd is truncated and forms the gap between the cbd and the binary if the viscous torque is less than the resonant toque .",
    "the inner edge of the cbd is formed at the given resonance radius where the viscous torque is balanced with the resonant torque : @xmath44 where the summation is taken over all combination of ( m , l ) which give the same resonance radius .",
    "actually , criterion ( [ eq : crit ] ) is determined only by the viscous torque and the torques from the olr of the lowest - order potential component , because the torques from the olr dominate those from the cr in the cbd and high - order potential components contribute little to the total torque , even if the eccentricity of the binary is not small @xcite . following @xcite , the inner edge of the cbd @xmath45",
    "is approximately determined by @xmath46 resonant torque in the binary with a low eccentricity : @xmath47 .",
    "it is confirmed by @xcite that this value is also applicable for the bbh with the moderate eccentricity @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the bbh transfers most angular momentum to the cbd via the 1:3 resonant radius @xmath49 .",
    "below , the set of @xmath50 is regarded as @xmath51 , unless otherwise noted .",
    "the long - term evolution of the semi - major axis and of the orbital eccentricity are mainly driven by the resonant interaction between the bbh and the cbd . in this section ,",
    "we firstly describe the evolutionary relation between the semi - major axis and the orbital eccentricity , the evolution of the semi - major axis , the evolution of the orbital eccentricity , and finally the effect of the mass transfer from the cbd on the orbital evolution of the bbh .      as",

    "the combination of the orbital decay and the eccentricity growth makes it possible for the massive bbh to coalesce with a hubble time .",

    "the orbital eccentricity is rapidly close to @xmath59 during @xmath164 even if the bbh is initially on a circular orbit , while the semi - major axis is 0.0 during @xmath72 regardless of the orbital eccentricity . the high value of the orbital eccentricity results in a rapid merger within a hubble time through the emission of the gravitational radiation .",
    "when the mass transfer rate is larger than the critical one , a semi - major axis grows with time whereas the orbital eccentricity decays with time .",
    "in such a system , the semi - major axis reaches to the hardening radius of the bbh , typically @xmath165 when @xmath166 , and its orbit is completely circularized .",

    "<S> a massive binary black hole ( bbh ) is inevitably formed in a merged galactic nucleus before the black holes finally merge by emitting the gravitational radiation . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is still unknown how the bbh evolves after its semi - major axis reached to the sub - parsec / parsec scale where the dynamical friction with the neighboring stars is no longer effective ( the so - called the final parsec problem ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a new mechanism by which the massive bbh can naturally coalesce within a hubble time . </S>",
    "<S> we study the evolution of the bbh with triple disks which are composed of an accretion disk around each black hole and one circumbinary disk surrounding them . </S>",
    "<S> while the circumbinary disk removes the orbital angular momentum of the bbh via the binary - disk resonant interaction , the mass transfer from the circumbinary disk to each black hole adds some fraction of its angular momentum to the orbital angular momentum of the bbh . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is a critical value of the mass - transfer rate where the extraction of the orbital angular momentum from the bbh is balanced with the addition of the orbital angular momentum to the bbh . </S>",
    "<S> the semi - major axis of the bbh decays with time whereas the orbital eccentricity of the bbh grows with time , if the mass transfer rate is smaller than the critical one , and vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> its evolutionary timescale is characterized by the product of the viscous timescale of the circumbinary disk and the ratio of the total black hole mass to the mass of the circumbinary disk . </S>",
    "<S> since a minimum value of the critical mass - transfer rate is larger than the eddington accretion rate of massive black holes with masses in the @xmath0 to @xmath1 range as far as the evolutionary timescale is shorter than a hubble time , it is promising that the critical mass - transfer rate is larger than the mass transfer rate . </S>",
    "<S> most of massive bbhs , therefore , enable to merge within a hubble time by the proposed mechanism , which helps to solve the final parsec problem . </S>"
