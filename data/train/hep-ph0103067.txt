    "the full minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) parameter space contains dozens of parameters . however , the supersymmetric contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment depends at tree - level only on the quantities @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath20 , @xmath0 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 . therefore it is possible to comprehend the impact of supersymmetry by using scans over parameter space which include experimental constraints",

    "we have conducted an exhaustive examination of the relevant mssm parameter space without imposing conditions that follow from model - building prejudice , in particular without requiring the usual gaugino mass unification condition between @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in general , the supersymmetric contribution to @xmath8 can be made larger for larger values of @xmath0 and smaller masses of the lighter chargino . however , in contrast to some recent reports , we find that it is quite possible to accommodate the e821 results even with rather low @xmath0 and for arbitrarily heavy charginos .",
    "this can be seen directly from eq .",
    "( [ lightbino ] ) , by plugging in typical values . as long as @xmath45 and @xmath46 are not tied together by a unification condition",

    "even for @xmath56 , the contribution can be large enough to fall within the present 2-@xmath54 bounds .",
    "the results for the maximum possible value of @xmath57 are shown in fig .",

    "all of the other parameters are taken to be independent , subject to the constraint that all charged superpartners are heavier than 100 gev and the lightest neutralino is heavier than 50 gev ( to provide approximate agreement with present and imminent bounds from the final results of the lep2 experiments ) . in order to avoid the possibility of charge- and color - breaking vacua ,",
    "we have imposed a constraint @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "the precise value of this bound generally does not have a large effect on the contours shown .",
    "however , in these plots we have found it appropriate to make two significant concessions to model - dependent prejudice , as follows .",
    "first , we have also included a 100 gev lower bound on the lighter stau mass , by assuming universality in soft slepton parameters @xmath60 and @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and then requiring @xmath63 gev . with these assumptions , requiring the staus to be heavier than 100 gev imposes a stronger indirect constraint on the smuon , because of the mixings proportional to @xmath64 for staus and @xmath65 for smuons . strictly speaking",
    ", this type of requirement does not correspond to a model - independent framework , where lepton flavor universality need not be imposed ; all bounds from low - energy lepton - number violation can be evaded by simple alignment in lepton flavor space . however , perhaps the most natural way to satisfy these constraints is to impose lepton universality at high energies .",
    "this constraint is most significant for smaller smuon masses and smaller values of @xmath0 ( less than roughly 10 or so ) , where the chargino - sneutrino loops do not necessarily dominate in @xmath57 . since in most cases",
    "the bounds are saturated by large mixing in the slepton sectors arising dominantly from the effects of large @xmath20 , this requirement is not very sensitive to the precise values used for the soft parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 , which can be affected by renormalization group running from a high scale where universality is imposed . in any case , we emphasize that in principle _ even larger _ values of @xmath57 can be obtained than are presented here .",
    "second , we have imposed a maximum value of @xmath69 gev .",
    "if one chooses to allow larger values of @xmath20 , then one can construct models with larger contributions to @xmath70 , resulting from neutralino - smuon loops dominated by a light smuon with a large mixing angle due to the off - diagonal terms proportional to @xmath20 in the squared - mass matrix .",
    "the prospect of very large @xmath55 often causes discomfort since it requires fine - tuning in the higgs potential in order to obtain electroweak symmetry breaking in accord with experiment .",
    "however , it should be noted that in general the upper bound on contributions to @xmath70 increases with the assumed maximum allowed @xmath55 .",
    "we have not imposed any requirement that the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) is a neutralino . while the existence of a neutralino lsp could make an attractive candidate for the cold dark matter , in a general model framework it is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for an acceptable cosmology .",
    "furthermore , in models which saturate the maximum possible @xmath71 , a neutralino is typically light , so that imposing such a constraint would generally not affect our results , except below when we impose gaugino mass unification on the parameter space .",
    "several features of fig .",
    "[ maxgeneral ] deserve comment . in the graph of maximum @xmath57 as a function of chargino mass , there are distinct regions separated by an  elbow \" ( which is most visibly pronounced in the case of @xmath72 ) . for chargino masses to the right of the elbow in each case ,",
    "the bound is saturated by models with the maximum allowed value of @xmath55 and small @xmath73 , and in fact the graph is nearly flat as the dominant contribution comes mainly from neutralino - smuon loops , as in eq .",
    "( [ lightbino ] ) .",
    "these models also have smuon masses ( and stau masses ) near their lower bound .",
    "for chargino masses to the left of the elbow , the maximum of @xmath57 tends to be saturated for models with much smaller values of @xmath74 , and the chargino loops play a more important role .",
    "as @xmath0 is increased , the chargino loops become relatively more important , and the dependence on the chargino masses extends out to much larger values before they decouple .    in the graph of maximum @xmath57 as a function of smuon mass in fig .",
    "[ maxgeneral ] , the cases with smaller @xmath0 exhibit some structure . for smuon masses just above 100 gev ,",
    "the models that saturate the bound have @xmath74 of order 200 gev ; much larger values of @xmath55 which could otherwise increase @xmath70 would conflict with our assumptions stated above regarding the limit on the lighter stau mass . in an intermediate region for the lightest smuon mass ,",
    "the models that saturate the bound are the ones with the maximum allowed value of @xmath74 and small @xmath73 , as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ lightbino ] ) .",
    "this leads to a bump in the maximum @xmath57 ; this is prominent for @xmath75 , is just barely visible for @xmath72",
    "( near smuon mass of 145 gev ) and disappears entirely for larger values of @xmath0 . for larger @xmath0 or larger smuon masses , the models that saturate the bound again have much smaller @xmath74 ( of order 200 gev ) .",
    "the effect of varying the maximum allowed value for @xmath74 is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ maxgeneralmuvar ] for @xmath76 , using @xmath77 and 2000 gev .",
    "the graph shows that for a given chargino mass , the upper bound on @xmath57 is usually obtained for the maximum allowed @xmath74 .",
    "however , as a function of the lighter smuon mass , the upper bound on @xmath57 is saturated for large @xmath74 only in a finite range of the smuon mass . again , this is because for smuon masses very close to the experimental limit , the effects of large @xmath74 are limited by our requirement that the stau is not too light , while for sufficiently large smuon masses the chargino - sneutrino loops become more important .",
    "it is also interesting to see how our results would change if one restricts to a class of models that make the usual assumption of gaugino mass unification predicted by supergravity - inspired models with unification of gauge couplings and universal soft - supersymmetry breaking couplings , namely m_1 = 53 ^2_w m_20.5 m_2 .",
    "[ gauginomassunification ] it is plausible from a model - building perspective that slepton and higgs soft squared masses can be affected by unknown @xmath78-term contributions @xcite-@xcite and other sources of non - universality .",
    "this supports the idea of an unrestricted parameter space for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath20 , and @xmath53 , while still maintaining the condition eq .",
    "( [ gauginomassunification ] ) .",
    "therefore we show the effects of imposing this assumption on the parameter space in fig .",
    "[ maxgeneralunif ] .",
    "this graph shows that requiring gaugino mass unification does significantly impact the maximum obtainable @xmath57 for larger values of the chargino mass .",
    "this is clearly because if gaugino mass unification is imposed , heavy charginos necessarily means that the neutralino - smuon loop also decouples . without the gaugino mass unification requirement ,",
    "a significant contribution from the lightest smuon and bino - like neutralino loop can be independent of the chargino masses .",
    "however , the results for the maximum @xmath57 as a function of the lighter smuon mass are essentially unaffected by the requirement of gaugino mass unification , since the bounds in that case are saturated by models with lighter charginos anyway .",
    "the above results were obtained for general values of all phases of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath20 , and @xmath53 .",
    "it is useful to remark that the maximum values of @xmath57 , for fixed magnitudes of the parameters , is generally obtained when they are all real .",
    "for example , this is illustrated for a particular choice of parameters ( close to a dilaton - dominated supergravity model ) in fig .",
    "[ phases ] .    in the left graph ,",
    "we show @xmath57 as a function of chargino mass , with fixed @xmath81 , @xmath82 gev , @xmath83 gev , @xmath84 gev , and slepton parameters @xmath85 gev , @xmath86 gev , and @xmath87 gev .",
    "the range of values for @xmath88 , obtained by varying over all possible phase values , fills out the region enclosed in the solid lines , while the circles at the corners denote the points obtained when all parameters are real . in the right - hand graph , the same thing",
    "is done for the same model , but with @xmath89 280 gev ( equal to @xmath46 ) so that chargino mixing and neutralino mixing effects are larger .",
    "this illustrates that while the dependence on the phases is quite strong as has been noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the maximal contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment occurs for real parameters ; in particular it usually occurs for positive real @xmath20 , if @xmath45 and @xmath46 are both positive and real .",
    "this result is not surprising .",
    "unlike chiral violating interactions , cp - violation breaks no symmetry critical to @xmath8 and so its introduction can not overwhelm the calculation .",
    "the extremes of constructive and destructive interference naturally occur for @xmath90 ( i.e. , @xmath91 or @xmath92 ) .",
    "therefore , imposing bounds from cp - violation experiments has no effect on the results shown in figs .  1 - 3 .",
    "the full supersymmetry parameter space , including all supersymmetric masses and mixing angles , contains well over 100 free parameters .",
    "the vast majority of this parameter space is ruled out by experimental measurements of proton lifetime , flavor changing neutral currents , and cp - violating observables . ideas to solve these problems in supersymmetry",
    "are varied . however , there exists two baseline , or minimal models , that are largely immune from all past experimental constraints , and are often employed to estimate accessibility of supersymmetry in new experiments .",
    "these two models are called `` minimal supergravity '' ( sugra ) and `` minimal gauge mediation '' ( gmsb ) .",
    "one advantage of having minimal models as baselines for comparing expectations of supersymmetry is that they existed and were well - motivated before anomalies were seen by experiment .",
    "they therefore provide a more restrictive but still dispassionate view of how easily supersymmetry can accommodate non - sm effects , complementary to that obtained from the fully model - independent framework described in the previous section . when the measurement of @xmath93 appeared to have a @xmath94 deviation from the sm prediction , it was shown that sugra could not accommodate it  @xcite .",
    "one could attain @xmath95 in supersymmetry only by entertaining unusual corners of parameter space .",
    "it might be accurate to say that the sugra analysis of @xmath96 has turned out to be the most enlightening one .",
    "we perform the sugra analysis here for similar dispassionate reasons .",
    "one expects a large class of viable supersymmetric theories to be in the neighborhood of sugra , especially for the subset of mssm parameters that enter into the @xmath8 calculation .",
    "we also do an analysis for gmsb since that constitutes a separate , equally interesting minimal model positioned in a different large neighborhood of viable supersymmetric theories . for the reader",

    "going from right to left , some of the lines terminate abruptly .",
    "the reason for this is that we have required all lines , dashed or solid , to be consistent with @xmath103 , which is our conservative cut based on anticipated limits from the final lep2 analyses . since the stau mass matrix in most models , including this one , is correlated closely with the smuon mass matrix , we can test unambiguously if @xmath104 .",

    "using just this one quantity to divine predictions for other observables is difficult for the obvious reason that each observable requires a different set of supersymmetry masses and mixing angles .",
    "furthermore , even within a narrowly defined version of supersymmetry , such as sugra , a single value of @xmath88 maps to a vast parameter space within the model .      with the above caveats we make a few general comments on expected correlating phenomena .",
    "all remarks are based on one generally drawn conclusion : the large @xmath8 measurement at e821 likes a supersymmetric interpretation with larger @xmath0 and lighter superpartners .",
    "the exact values of @xmath0 and superpartner masses are model - dependent . in the previous sections",
    ", we have shown that in the most general mssm no meaningful bounds can be placed on the chargino mass , and weak bounds can be placed on the lightest smuon mass .",
    "for example , if @xmath144 then @xmath145 .",
    "however , we readily admit that one does not find _ generically _ in mssm parameter space that the lightest smuon mass can be above several hundred gev and @xmath88 within @xmath116 . this assessment is made by analyzing minimal models and making agenda - less tours in supersymmetry parameter space",
    ". therefore , we would _ cautiously _ agree  @xcite",
    "that the first statement to make about correlating phenomena is that smuons should be light .",
    "smuons are notoriously difficult objects to discover at hadron colliders  @xcite .",
    "they are relatively easy to find at @xmath146 machines , but of course the center of mass energy must be sufficient to produce them .",
    "other conclusions are a bit more subtle .",
    "for example , large @xmath0 is also preferred by higgs search results at lep2 .",
    "higgs bosons greater than ( or equal to ) @xmath147 have put strain on low @xmath0 models ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this can be seen most readily by the prediction for the lightest supersymmetric scalar higgs boson mass eigenstate in the @xmath148 limit : m^2_h = m_z^2 ^ 2 2 + .",
    "[ higgs mass ] this formula is exact if one is willing to tolerate an extremely complicated form for @xmath149 , otherwise it can be interpreted as approximate  @xcite with @xmath150 .",
    "the first term representing the tree - level mass prediction grows larger with @xmath0 .",
    "furthermore , although not obvious from the form of eq .",
    "( [ higgs mass ] ) , the radiative corrections to the higgs mass can increase with larger @xmath0 also ( i.e. , @xmath151 depends mildly on @xmath0 ) . as a simple illustration , for @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) we need @xmath154 ( @xmath155 ) to ensure @xmath113",
    "this tendency for higher @xmath0 with lower superpartner masses to satisfy the higgs mass bound is in the same direction as the requirements of @xmath88 .",
    "we remark that we would not be surprised if the higgs sector were different than the simple two higgs doublets of the mssm .",
    "for example , an additional singlet field with superpotential term @xmath156 may even be more preferred since it can lead to spontaneous generation of the @xmath157 term , among other advantages .",
    "the lightest higgs boson in this case would then get a contribution to its mass proportional to @xmath158 , potentially making @xmath0 limits from higgs boson mass in the mssm irrelevant , depending on the size of the yukawa coupling @xmath159 .",
    "another potentially important correlation is in dark matter relic abundance and dark matter detection .",
    "several authors  @xcite have noted that within some specific frameworks , e.g.  sugra , the dark matter detection rate prediction is large when @xmath88 is large . this is partly because coherent scattering of dark matter off nuclei similarly requires a chirality flip and so is enhanced by larger @xmath0 .",
    "recently , dama has claimed a signal in the annual modulation of wimp - nuclei scattering  @xcite .",
    "the supersymmetric interpretation implies a large spin - independent coherent scattering cross - section , which is easier to attain at large @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the dama signal may or may not be real , but the correlation remains : large @xmath0 implied by @xmath88 generally implies larger scattering cross - sections for dark matter detectors .",
    "of course , it is possible that supersymmetry has nothing to do with dark matter because @xmath127-parity is not conserved , or some other reason , in which case these issues become irrelevant .    as for relic abundance of the lightest neutralino",
    ", light sleptons could create a problem for the supersymmetric interpretation of dark matter since they induce an efficient @xmath160-channel annihilation channel in @xmath161 .",
    "the larger the annihilation channel the smaller the relic abundance ( @xmath162 ) .",
    "however , there is a large region of parameter space for light sleptons  @xcite ( but heavier than @xmath143 ) that is consistent with adequate thermal relic abundance to be cosmologically interesting , @xmath163 .",
    "furthermore , in the regions where there is small thermal relic abundance from light sleptons or large coannihilation effects  @xcite , there are non - thermal sources  @xcite of the lsps that could regenerate them as dark matter .",
    "therefore , we do not think relic abundance considerations add significantly to the dialog on @xmath88 at this point .",
    "lastly , we remark on @xmath2 .",
    "there is a close similarity between @xmath8 and @xmath2 in that both get large @xmath0 enhancements from a higgsino - sfermion - fermion interaction vertex with a down - fermion yukawa coupling .",
    "if the e821 experiment had measured @xmath165 instead of @xmath166 , the measurement of @xmath2 would have disfavored many supersymmetric interpretations .",
    "however , it happens that @xmath88 prefers @xmath167 ( for real positive gaugino masses ) and large @xmath0 , and @xmath2 severely restricts @xmath168 and large @xmath0 , but does not significantly restrict @xmath167 .",
    "it is well - known that @xmath169 is not as restricted by b(@xmath170  @xcite as @xmath171 , since the signs of the amplitudes in this circumstance imply partial cancellations .",
    "recently , this conclusion was strengthened even more by the evaluation of higher - order calculations to @xmath2 . at higher order one must self - consistently take into account the finite @xmath172-quark mass corrections which are enhanced dramatically at large @xmath0 .",
    "these corrections imply smaller @xmath172-quark yukawa coupling and therefore smaller magnitude for the higgsino - squark - quark chirality flip . from fig .  2 of  @xcite",
    "one can see the reduction in the supersymmetric prediction for large @xmath0 with @xmath173 , rendering @xmath2 unable to significantly constrain large _ positive _ @xmath88 scenarios .",
    "the above discussion is mostly based on sugra - like relations among superpartner masses .",
    "a similar conclusion can be inferred from ref .",
    "@xcite , wherein @xmath2 has little impact on the viability of the cmssm to explain @xmath88 .",
    "the same discussion holds for gmsb since the squarks are even heavier in that model , and @xmath2 was never much of a serious constraint  @xcite when all the uncertainties are accounted for .",
    "other theories of supersymmetry breaking such as anomaly mediated supersymmetry breaking ( amsb )  @xcite appear to have difficulty accomodating @xmath88  @xcite .",
    "this difficulty arises because @xmath174 and the lightest gauginos are winos with small positive @xmath46 , leading to a severe constraint on @xmath167 parameter space from @xmath2 . the @xmath44 model with a supersymmetry breaking f - term in the * 24 * representation discussed at the end of sec .",
    "( 1.2 ) also has @xmath174 .",
    "however , in this case the ratios @xmath175 and @xmath176 imply that the lightest neutralino and smuon entering the @xmath88 loop corrections would be significantly lighter than the squarks and charginos that affect @xmath2 . even though these mass hierarchies make @xmath2 less important of a constraint than it is in amsb , careful evaluation of the next - to - leading order @xmath177 prediction would need to be compared with experiment to ultimately judge the viability of this model to explain @xmath88 .",
    "one also must approach the @xmath2 observable with a bit of caution when trying to rule out parameter space consistent with @xmath88 .",
    "most analyses implicitly assume that the theory prediction is precise , and it need only fit into the range obtained from experimental measurement , often quoted to be between @xmath178 .",
    "the sm theory prediction  @xcite is ( 3.290.33)10 ^ -4  ( sm  theory ) .",
    "this @xmath179 error , whether one interprets it as a @xmath116 error or @xmath180 c.l . , clearly implies that there should be comparable error in the theory prediction of any theory evaluated at the same nlo rigor .",
    "supersymmetry , it should be noted , has not been calculated fully to nlo .",
    "therefore it is safe to presume that the supersymmetry prediction will be at least 10% uncertain , and it must be taken into account in any careful analysis .    equally important as the accuracy of the theory prediction",
    "is the fact that the experimental measurement of @xmath2 is not a pure observable in that a severe cut on the photon energy is needed to reduce charm backgrounds in the analysis at cleo .",
    "this introduces theoretical uncertainties  @xcite in addition to the obvious ones , such as imprecise knowledge of the @xmath172-quark mass , @xmath181 and the not - completely - known contributions scaling as @xmath182 .",
    "therefore , the cleo measurement is expressed as  @xcite ( 3.150.35 0.32 0.26 ) 10 ^ -4  ( cleo ) where the errors are statistical , systematic , and model - dependence , respectively .",
    "these kinds of varied errors should give pause when advocating a hard cut on @xmath2 in supersymmetry , and one should be wary about deleting any part of parameter space based on an apparent incompatibility with the @xmath2 constraint .    in our more general mssm discussion of section 2 , the @xmath2 constraint does not even need to be discussed since no values of the squarks masses enter .",
    "for this more general model , we can simply claim that the squark masses are sufficiently massive as to contribute little to @xmath177 . from the discussions",
    "above , we conclude that @xmath2 , as with all other observables , usually adds no significant burden in a quest to find a supersymmetric explanation for @xmath88 .        for an historical survey of the calculation ,",

    "<S> this requires a light smuon ; however , we show that , somewhat surprisingly , no model - independent bound can be placed on the mass of the lightest chargino for any @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the maximum contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment are insensitive to cp - violating phases . </S>",
    "<S> we provide analyses of the supersymmetric contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment in dilaton - dominated supergravity models and gauge - mediated supersymmetry - breaking models . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss how other phenomena , such as @xmath2 , relic abundance of the lightest superpartner , and the higgs mass may be correlated with the anomalous magnetic moment , but do not significantly impact the viability of a supersymmetric explanation , or the mass limits obtainable on smuons and charginos .    </S>",
