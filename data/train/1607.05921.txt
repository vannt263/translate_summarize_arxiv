    "quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) is a prominent family of techniques for studying strong correlations in quantum many - body systems @xcite . in particular ,",
    "the variational and diffusion monte carlo methods ( vmc and dmc ) are accurate tools for studying ground - state energies and expectation values .",
    "both methods are predicated on the use of a trial wavefunction , whose similarity to the true ground state determines the accuracy and efficiency of the calculations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to have access to a high fidelity trial wavefunction .",
    "a common foundation for constructing a fermionic trial wavefunction is to begin with the hartree ",

    "the slater determinants encode the fermionic antisymmetry of the trial wavefunction , ensuring pauli exchange is satisfied , but do not include any effects of electron correlation . to describe such correlations ,",
    "we modify the trial wavefunction to be of the slater  jastrow @xcite form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a jastrow factor that is a function of all the electron positions , @xmath5 . for real @xmath6",
    "the jastrow factor is positive definite , and hence does not modify the nodal structure of the hartree  fock wavefunction .    in order to allow the jastrow factor to accurately describe the correlations in a particular system of interest",
    ", @xmath6 depends on a number of variational parameters @xcite .",
    "these parameters can be optimized using the relatively inexpensive vmc method , and then the optimal trial wavefunction used as the starting point for a more accurate but more expensive dmc calculation . in principle",
    "the dmc estimate of the energy depends only on the nodal surface of the trial wavefunction @xcite , but in practice a more accurate trial wavefunction with an optimized jastrow factor allows the method to proceed more efficiently .    in this paper",
    "we consider jastrow factors for infinite , periodic systems .",
    "these systems are amenable to numerical simulation through the use of finite simulation cells which are tessellated , with periodic boundary conditions , to fill all of space .",
    "jastrow factors in the literature tend to either respect the short range radial symmetry of the coulomb interaction , or abide by the symmetry of the simulation cells , but not both @xcite . here",
    "we propose a jastrow factor that interpolates between these symmetries ; is easier to use than current jastrow factors by virtue of having a single parameter that tunes its accuracy , as opposed to two such parameters for other jastrow factors of similar accuracy ; requires fewer variational parameters to reach comparable accuracy ; and is 40% quicker to evaluate than these current jastrow factors .",
    "all of our qmc simulations were performed using the casino package @xcite , and we use hartree atomic units throughout this paper . in section",
    "[ sec : jastrow_factor ] we review common jastrow factors from the literature , and then show how our proposed jastrow factor fits into this hierarchy . in section  [ sec : heg ] and section",
    "[ sec : beryllium ] we examine the accuracy and efficiency of the jastrow factors in the homogeneous electron gas and crystalline beryllium , respectively , before drawing our conclusions in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "we are concerned with jastrow factors that capture correlation between electrons , and hence include functions of electron - electron separation , @xmath7 where @xmath8 , the sum runs over all electrons labeled @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and we refer to @xmath11 as a jastrow function .",
    "the jastrow function contains variational parameters that we optimize within a vmc calculation to minimize the variance in the local energy @xcite .",
    "there are some fundamental constraints on the form of the jastrow function .",
    "firstly , in order to retain the spin expectation value of the hartree ",
    "fock wavefunction @xmath11 must be even under exchange of particles .",
    "secondly , in order to avoid non - physical divergences in the local energy , @xmath11 must be at least twice - differentiable everywhere except at particle coalescence ( @xmath12 )",
    ".    however , at particle coalescence the coulombic potential energy of two electrons diverges . in order to retain a non - divergent local energy",
    "the kinetic energy therefore has to diverge in the opposite direction at particle coalescence .",
    "this may be achieved by imposing the kato cusp conditions @xcite on the wavefunction , which may be expressed as @xmath13 giving spherically - symmetric behavior at short radius @xmath14 , where , for 3d systems , and @xmath15 .",
    "the final constraint on the jastrow factor is that , in periodic systems like those we consider here , @xmath11 must satisfy periodic boundary conditions at the edge of the simulation cell in order to tessellate space .    before presenting and testing our proposal for a jastrow factor ,",
    "we first review other jastrow factors that are commonly used in the literature .",
    "we organize the jastrow factors by their symmetry , starting with a spherically symmetric function and then examining a jastrow factor with the symmetry of the simulation cell before proposing our jastrow factor that interpolates between these symmetries .",
    "the interaction between two isolated electrons is isotropic , and so it is reasonable to take the jastrow factor as being spherically symmetric and purely a function of particle separation where two - body effects dominate , and especially at inter - particle separations shorter than the average nearest - neighbor separation in many - body systems .",
    "however , the simulation cells used in numerical calculations are not spherically symmetric as they have to tessellate to fill 3d space .",
    "because of this requirement , and in order to limit the effect of otherwise infinite - ranged terms to within the simulation cell , radial terms in the jastrow factor are cut off at a finite radius that is less than or equal to the wigner ",
    "seitz radius corresponding to the simulation cell .",
    "this is implemented by including a term @xmath16 in the jastrow function , which goes to zero at a radius @xmath17 , with @xmath18 continuous derivatives .",
    "we take @xmath19 in order to keep the local energy continuous at the cutoff radius @xcite .",
    "@xmath20 is a heaviside step function , which forces the jastrow function to be zero everywhere beyond the radius @xmath17 .",
    "it has been found in the literature @xcite that a taylor expansion in electron - electron separation captures the most important short - ranged isotropic inter - particle correlations , and so here we review that expansion .",

    "the term @xmath25/3 $ ] ensures that the kato cusp conditions are satisfied . using a pseudopotential for the electron - electron interaction @xcite would set @xmath26 .    the @xmath22 term jastrow function with parameters optimized for an homogeneous electron gas with @xmath27 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : functions_u ] .",
    "the short - range behavior of the @xmath22 term is linear to satisfy the kato cusp condition , and then at large separation the cutoff function limits the range of the @xmath22 term to within the wigner - seitz radius of the simulation cell , shown as a gray arc in fig .",
    "[ fig : functions_u ] .",
    "this not only limits the maximum range of the correlations that can be captured by the @xmath22 term , but also prevents it from capturing correlations in the corners of the simulation cell .",
    "+ [ fig : jastrow_fns ]      one method to extend the ability of the jastrow factor to capture correlations over the whole simulation cell is to use a form of jastrow factor that innately has the space - group symmetry of the simulation cell .",
    "a simple but effective example of a jastrow function that has such symmetry is a plane - wave basis , which also explicitly ensures periodicity of the jastrow function .",
    "the so - called @xmath28 term takes the form @xcite @xmath29 here the @xmath30 are the reciprocal lattice vectors of the simulation cell that belong to the @xmath31 star of vectors equivalent under the full symmetry group of the simulation cell , sorted by increasing size of @xmath32 ( and in periodic systems not including the trivial vector @xmath33 ) ; `` @xmath34 '' means that if @xmath35 is included in the sum , @xmath36 is excluded ; and the @xmath37 are variational parameters , of which there are @xmath38 .    a @xmath28 term with @xmath39 for the homogeneous electron gas is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : functions_p ] .",
    "the @xmath28 term exists over the whole simulation cell , including where the @xmath22 term is cut off to zero .",
    "this means the @xmath28 term can capture correlations in the cell corners that the @xmath22 term misses .",
    "however , the @xmath28 term does not tend to a radial form at short radius and so can not satisfy the kato cusp conditions at particle coalescence , meaning that on its own it does not make for an effective jastrow factor . a common approach in the literature @xcite is to combine both @xmath22 and @xmath28 terms to give a composite jastrow function @xmath40 which uses the @xmath22 term to capture short - range correlations and the kato cusp conditions , and the @xmath28 term to capture long - range correlations in the corners of the simulation cell .",
    "we refer to such a combination as a @xmath22 & @xmath28 term .",
    "an example of this composite jastrow function , with @xmath41 and @xmath39 and parameters optimized in an homogeneous electron gas , is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : functions_u1p ] . as expected , the behavior at short range is dominated by the @xmath22 term . yet at large radius this jastrow function has structure due to the @xmath28 term , including in the corner of the simulation cell outside the cutoff radius of the @xmath22 term , shown by the gray arc , which allows the composite @xmath22 & @xmath28 term to capture longer - range correlations .",
    "however , this construction has several undesirable features that limit its effectiveness at capturing inter - particle correlations . for a given amount of computing time to be spent optimizing the parameters in the jastrow factor , a choice needs to be made of the relative number of @xmath22 and @xmath28 terms to be used .",
    "we do not know a priori the optimal ratio of @xmath23 to @xmath38 , and so must explore a two - dimensional parameter space to determine it .",
    "a large proportion of the vmc calculation time is spent evaluating the jastrow factor , and so it is important that the jastrow factor is as simple as possible .",
    "but there is not equality of expense between the @xmath22 and @xmath28 terms , as sinusoidal @xmath28 terms are more expensive to calculate than polynomial @xmath22 terms , and the expense of a @xmath28 term also increases with the number of elements of the reciprocal lattice vector stars used to evaluate it .",
    "higher - order stars generally contain more elements than lower - order ones , meaning high - order @xmath28 terms are even more expensive to calculate . to further complicate the optimization of the @xmath22 & @xmath28 term ,",
    "although the @xmath28 term was intended to capture longer - range correlations , it does also exist at short radius ; this means it interferes with the effect of higher - order contributions from the @xmath22 term .    one further problem with the form of jastrow function given by eq .",
    "( [ up_jastrow ] ) is that the cutoff length @xmath17 enters the expression non - linearly . to optimize the cutoff length and other parameters we need to solve a multi - dimensional non - linear set of equations , which is a significantly more difficult problem than solving a multi - dimensional linear set of equations , where the full force of linear algebra may be applied to increase the efficiency of the process @xcite .",
    "we are interested in finding a form for the jastrow factor that avoids these problems with the current method , by being a term with a single tuning parameter that determines the accuracy of the jastrow factor , and which is also cheap to evaluate with linear coefficients .",
    "at the same time the proposed term should reproduce the advantageous properties of the @xmath22 term , accurately capturing short - range correlations , and also the @xmath28 term , exhibiting the symmetry of the simulation cell at large inter - particle separation .",
    "we propose a jastrow factor that combines the properties and symmetries of the @xmath22 term at small radius with the properties and symmetries of the @xmath28 term at large separation .",
    "the jastrow function , referred to here as the @xmath42 term , is @xmath43 where the @xmath44 parameters @xmath45 are optimized using vmc , and the length @xmath46 is the width of the simulation cell in the cartesian @xmath47-direction . in section  [ sec : gennu ] below we generalize the @xmath42 term to non - cuboidal geometries .    at small radius , the function @xmath48 , and so .",
    "this has the correct spherical symmetry to describe short - range electron - electron correlations , so at short radius the jastrow function @xmath49 consists of an expansion in electron - electron separation , similarly to the @xmath22 term .",
    "this means the @xmath42 term will reproduce the ability of the @xmath22 term to capture short - ranged correlations and it is easy to satisfy the kato cusp conditions by setting @xmath50 .",
    "the function @xmath51 is symmetric under @xmath52 , and automatically satisfies periodic boundary conditions at the edge of the simulation cell , with @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 : this is achieved through the use of the cubic power in the definition of @xmath56 , chosen by analogy to the cutoff function in the @xmath22 term to distinguish long- and short - ranged components of the jastrow function .",
    "importantly , the @xmath56 functions satisfying periodic boundary conditions means any function constructed from them , such as the @xmath42 term , will also correctly satisfy periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the scaling of the @xmath56 functions in the different cartesian directions lends the @xmath42 term the symmetry of the simulation cell at large inter - particle separation , and allows the @xmath42 term to capture long - range correlations , similarly to the @xmath28 term .",
    "not requiring a cut - off function also means all the variational parameters enter the expression for @xmath57 linearly , and so are easier to optimize than the equivalent number of variational parameters in the @xmath22 term @xcite .",
    "the @xmath42 jastrow function optimized for a homogeneous electron gas is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : functions_nu ] , demonstrating that it has the same small - radius behavior as the @xmath22 term .",
    "we can also see that the @xmath42 term still has structure in the corner of the simulation cell , similarly to the @xmath22 & @xmath28 term , which allows it to capture long - range inter - particle correlations .",
    "we will examine this similarity in more detail in a case study of the homogeneous electron gas in section  [ sec : heg ] .",
    "freedom to optimize the behavior of the jastrow factor in the corners of the simulation cell also provides the freedom to change the kinetic energy of the wavefunction in the corners of the simulation cell , as @xmath58 .",
    "this allows the @xmath42 jastrow factor to more accurately respond to a finite and/or varying potential energy in the corners of the simulation cell . from a thomas  fermi perspective",
    "this provides the @xmath42 term with the freedom to counteract changes in the potential energy from interactions with kinetic energy in order to keep the total energy constant .",
    "the @xmath42 term may also be adapted to systems other than the 3d ones considered here . for 2d systems the @xmath59 function",
    "may simply be omitted ; or for slab geometries , with two directions periodic and one non - periodic , @xmath59 should be replaced by a function that reduces to @xmath60 at short radius , for example @xmath61 .    in order to demonstrate the advantages of the @xmath42 jastrow factor , in the next two sections we carry out simulations of the homogeneous electron gas and a crystalline solid .",
    "we examine the accuracy , efficiency , and ease of use of the @xmath42 jastrow factor , and compare it with other forms of jastrow factor used in the literature .",
    "for the first test of our jastrow factor we examine the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) .",
    "this system has been widely studied using qmc @xcite and serves as an analogue for electrons in a conductor . as it does not contain any atoms it allows us to focus on the electron - electron jastrow factor . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the intra - species correlations for the up- and down - spin electrons are identical , and so fix @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we examine a heg with density parameter @xmath27 in a cubic simulation cell subject to periodic boundary conditions , and use slater determinants of plane wave orbitals .",
    "we use a system of 57 up- and 57 down - spin electrons , and confirmed that the main results of this section were reproduced in systems of 33 and 81 electrons per spin species and so are independent of system size .",

    "as opposed to the @xmath78 required for the @xmath22 & @xmath28 terms means the @xmath42 term is easier to optimize .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath42 term has a single parameter @xmath44 that can be increased to improve accuracy , as opposed to having to choose both @xmath23 and @xmath38 for the @xmath22 & @xmath28 term , which reduces the size of the parameter space that needs to be explored .",
    "the @xmath42 term has captured all of the correlation energy available to the @xmath22 & @xmath28 terms in this system , but another important quantity in qmc methods is the variance in the estimate of the energy .",
    "the variance of the local energy determines the efficiency of dmc simulations @xcite and also acts as a proxy for the quality of trial wavefunctions , as the variance in the local energy of the exact ground state is zero . in fig .",

    "we also tested a cuspless form of the @xmath42 jastrow function to capture the electron - ion correlations , which agreed with the energies obtained using @xmath119 to within @xmath120 a.u . with the same number of variational parameters .",
    "this confirms that it is the short - range electron - ion correlations that are the most important to capture , and so we shall use the well - established @xmath119 term in the following investigations .    in all - electron qmc simulations , particularly of molecules , the addition of three - body electron - electron - ion correlations to the jastrow factor lowers the calculated energy @xcite , as these terms allow a more detailed description of tightly - bound electrons .",
    "however , electron - electron - ion correlations are less important in simulations using pseudopotentials , and including them here changes the correlation energy by less than 0.9% .",
    "similarly to the electron - ion term the dominant effect of electron - electron - ion terms is at short radius , and so the @xmath42 jastrow factor formalism is expected to offer limited improvements relative to an isotropic @xmath22-like term in constructing such terms . as electron - electron - ion terms make a small difference to the energy and will not help us to discrimitate between the @xmath22 , , and @xmath42 terms we neglect them here , although they should of course be included in simulations targeting high accuracy",
    ".    the full jastrow function is then obtained by combining the electron - ion term @xmath119 with the electron - electron jastrow functions under examination , the @xmath22 , , and generalized @xmath42 terms .",
    "we now examine the accuracy and efficiency of these jastrow functions for simulating crystalline beryllium .",
    "+ [ fig : beenergy ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : be_energy ] we compare the percentages of the dmc correlation energy missing , @xmath121 , when the various jastrow factors are used with @xmath69 variational parameters in the electron - electron jastrow factor .",
    "we observe that a @xmath22 term alone is always missing nearly 20% of the correlation energy , and moreover that the addition of a single @xmath28 term does not significantly improve the result .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the heg , where the addition of a single @xmath28 term was the most important step in achieving a high - accuracy @xmath22 & @xmath28 term .",
    "this is due to the fact that , in the beryllium simulation cell , the @xmath122 lattice vector orthogonal to the hexagonal planes is shorter than those in the @xmath123 plane , and so the first @xmath28 term only acts along the @xmath124 axis , not providing flexibility to capture correlations in the hexagonal planes .",
    "however , the addition of just one more @xmath28 term reduces the correlation energy missing to around 9% , and the addition of more @xmath28 terms to this does not significantly alter the result .",
    "this means that to achieve convergence we again require @xmath125 when using the @xmath22 & @xmath28 term .    as in the heg ,",
    "the @xmath42 term achieves comparable accuracy to the most accurate @xmath22 & @xmath28 terms , reaching convergence by @xmath126 .",
    "this , combined with the necessity of otherwise using @xmath78 for the @xmath22 and @xmath28 term , of which @xmath83 are expensive @xmath28 terms , means that the @xmath42 term is significantly cheaper to optimize and use than alternative jastrow factors .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : be_variance ] we examine the variance in the local energy using different jastrow factors .",
    "there is significantly less difference here between the jastrow factors than in the proportion of the correlation energy they capture , but the @xmath42 term again performs as well as the most detailed other jastrow factors , meaning that the trial wavefunctions have similar efficiency in dmc .",
    "& & + hexagonal ( be ) & 8.6(1)% & 9.3(1)% + bcc ( li ) & 4.7(1)% & 5.0(1)% + fcc ( si ) & 10.1(2)% & 9.6(2)% +    as well as hexagonal crystalline beryllium , we have also tested the electron - electron @xmath42 term in other crystals with different symmetry .",
    "the missing correlation energy when using the @xmath42 term and the @xmath83 @xmath22 & @xmath28 term is shown in table  [ tab : crystals ] .",
    "the @xmath22 & @xmath28 term is not significantly improved by increasing @xmath38 in any of these crystals , and we use @xmath79 as this is where the @xmath22 & @xmath28 term approaches its converged accuracy ; in each case the @xmath42 term is already converged .",
    "the two jastrow factors capture similar levels of the correlation energy in each system , indicating that the @xmath42 term is a good general choice of jastrow factor for use in crystalline systems , with the slight differences between the @xmath42 and @xmath22 & @xmath28 terms in different systems being due to the exact details of the symmetry of the simulation cell in each case , some of which are better captured by the @xmath42 term than others .",
    "however , overall the differences between jastrow factors are smaller than the differences between systems , and the @xmath42 jastrow factor achieves high accuracy whilst having fewer ( and only linear ) parameters to optimize and being cheaper to evaluate , due to being polynomial as opposed to sinusoidal .",
    "we have proposed and tested a form of electron - electron jastrow factor that interpolates between the radial symmetry of the coulomb potential at short range and the space - group symmetry of the simulation cell at large separation .",
    "the @xmath42 jastrow factor captures comparable levels of the correlation energy to the most detailed @xmath22 & @xmath28 terms used in the literature , and converges with fewer variational parameters .",
    "there is also only one choice of input to the @xmath42 term , the expansion order @xmath44 , which reduces the parameter space to be explored compared to the two variables , @xmath23 and @xmath38 , required for the @xmath22 & @xmath28 term . finally , the polynomial @xmath42 term is quicker to evaluate than the plane - wave @xmath28 term",
    ".    it would be possible to apply the ideas behind the @xmath42 term to higher angular - momentum terms in a jastrow factor : for instance , carrying out the transformation would allow the @xmath127 spherical harmonic to be expressed in a way that satisfies the symmetry of a cuboidal simulation cell .",
    "the @xmath42 term could also be used in systems with interactions other than the coulomb potential ; for instance , qmc may also be used to study the dipolar @xcite and contact @xcite interactions in cold atomic gases , and also more exotic interactions such as those found in 2d semiconductors @xcite .",
    "the interpolation between symmetries of the @xmath42 term could also be applicable more widely than just in jastrow factors .",
    "any expansion in or use of inter - particle separation in a numerical investigation could be written instead in terms of the @xmath56 and @xmath106 functions of the @xmath42 term , and so would immediately satisfy periodic boundary conditions in the simulation cell .",
    "systems that might be well - suited to this approach could include two - particle pairing orbitals in slater determinants @xcite , large - amplitude phonons simulated within density functional theory @xcite , or the construction of force fields that natively reflect bond angles for molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
