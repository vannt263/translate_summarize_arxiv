    "<S> the errors caused by qubit displacements from their prescribed locations in an ensemble of spin chains are estimated analytically and calculated numerically for a quantum computer based on phosphorus donors in silicon . </S>",
    "<S> we show that it is possible to polarize ( initialize ) the nuclear spins even with displaced qubits by using controlled not gates between the electron and nuclear spins of the same phosphorus atom . </S>",
    "<S> however , a controlled not gate between the displaced electron spins is implemented with large error because of the exponential dependence of exchange interaction constant on the distance between the qubits . </S>",
    "<S> if quantum computation is implemented on an ensemble of many spin chains , the errors can be small if the number of chains with displaced qubits is small . </S>"
