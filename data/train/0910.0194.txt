    "stellar plasmas are characterized by their composition and temperature .",
    "the energy distribution of nuclei according to the temperature is given by a maxwell - boltzmann ( mb ) function .",
    "this function peaks at comparatively low energy and thus the astrophysically relevant interaction energies of nuclei are low by nuclear physics standards .",
    "this is a challenge for experimental and theoretical nuclear physics , especially when dealing with charged - particle induced reactions .",
    "the thermalization of nuclei is very fast , even compared to reaction timescales .",
    "this populates excited states and reactions can proceed from the ground state and the excited states , contrary to reactions in the laboratory which only include targets in the ground state .",
    "the resulting change in the effective cross section is called stellar enhancement and usually given by the ratio of the stellar cross section to the ground state one , @xmath0 .",
    "the stellar enhancement factor @xmath1 can only be studied theoretically .",
    "stellar reaction rates are obtained by folding _ stellar _ cross sections with the mb distribution of the projectiles .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that _ stellar _ rates obey reciprocity whereas rates based on laboratory cross sections do not .",
    "since excited states in both the target and the final nucleus contribute , it is easy to see that more transitions beyond the g.s . transitions are involved in the final nucleus of an exothermic reaction compared to its target nucleus @xcite and thus @xmath2 . when studying an astrophysically relevant reaction in the laboratory , @xmath1 should be as close as possible to unity .",
    "therefore , it seems advantageous to study exothermic reactions .",
    "closer inspections reveals @xcite that the above rule is not appropriate in all cases .",
    "if transitions from excited state are systematically suppressed , there can be cases for which @xmath3 although the endothermic reaction in principle may allow more transitions from excited states . charged",
    "particle compound reactions provide such a suppression mechanism . with increasing excitation energy , the relative energy of the transitions between excited states and the compound state is decreasing . with a sufficiently high coulomb barrier ,",
    "the transitions from excited states are efficiently suppressed .",
    "we found @xcite that the stellar enhancement factor of the endothermic direction @xmath4 is lower than the one for the exothermic direction @xmath5 for more than 1200 reactions .",
    "this includes some reactions at or close to stability relevant in the p - process and reactions on highly unstable nuclei in the r- , rp- , and @xmath6p - process paths .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : supp ] , detailed lists of reactions are given in @xcite .",
    "measuring low - energy cross sections for charged - particle reactions is problematic due to the coulomb barrier causing the astrophysically relevant cross sections to be tiny . even more problematic",
    "is the standard way to obtain information on optical potentials through elastic scattering experiments .",
    "the scattering cross section at low - energy becomes indistinguishable from rutherford scattering .",
    "accordingly , the database for reactions involving protons and @xmath7s at astrophysically relevant energies is incomplete .",
    "proton capture rates at @xmath8 gk are important in the @xmath9-process which is thought to produce the majority of p - nuclei .",
    "an important difference to cross sections at higher energies is in the fact that the cross sections of the p - process are mostly sensitive to the particle widths instead of the @xmath9-widths .",
    "this is due to the coulomb barrier , reducing the charged particle width at low energy to values below those of the @xmath9-width .",
    "a series of ( p,@xmath9 ) and ( p , n ) reactions was measured at @xmath9-process energies recently ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the latter reactions are especially useful for testing the proton potential because the neutron width will ( almost always ) be larger than the proton width at all energies .",
    "several optical potentials were tested against the data and it was found that a modification of a widely used microscopic potential reproduces the data best .",
    "this is the potential by @xcite with low - energy modifications by @xcite ( jlm ) which were especially provided for applications in nuclear astrophysics .",
    "this microscopic potential is derived by applying the brueckner - hartree - fock approximation with reid s hard core nucleon - nucleon interaction and adopting a local density approximation .    despite of overall good agreement ,",
    "systematic deviations at low energy are still found ( see , e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : pg ] , more examples are shown in @xcite ) . by variation of the optical potential we found that an increase by 70% in the strength of the imaginary part considerably improved the reproduction of the data in hauser - feshbach calculations ( denoted by `` mod jlm '' in the figures ) .",
    "this increased absorption is allowed within the previous parameterization because the isoscalar and especially the isovector component of the imaginary part is not well constrained at low energies , as also noted by @xcite .",
    "also shown are results obtained with another recent , lane - consistent new parameterization of the jlm potential ( bauge @xcite ) .",
    "it yields worse agreement at low energy but it does neither include the additional modifications of @xcite , nor can it constrain the imaginary isovector part well at low energy @xcite because it was fitted to data at higher energy .    simultaneously with the ( p,@xmath9 ) data , also ( p , n ) data is described well by our newly modified potential , as shown in @xcite .",
    "it also works well when comparing to even more recent data ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] ) which was derived independently @xcite ) .    required input to the calculation of the optical potential is the nuclear density distribution .",
    "[ fig : dens ] also shows the dependence of the results when employing a droplet model density @xcite and one from an hartree - fock - bogolyubov model @xcite . for the reactions considered here ,",
    "the droplet description yields better agreement to the data in both absolute scale and energy dependence of the theoretical s - factor .",
    "therefore , all other shown results make use of this description if not explicitly mentioned otherwise . for comparison , fig .",
    "[ fig : dens ] also shows the results when employing the optical potentials of @xcite with both densities . in the original work ,",
    "hfb densities were employed @xcite .    summarizing , it was found that an improved reproduction of low - energy proton - induced data can be achieved by utilizing the potential of @xcite with a 70% increase in the strength of the imaginary part .",
    "this is not to say that the potential of @xcite should generally be changed but rather that there is room for a possible energy - dependent modification of the imaginary potential strength , acting at low proton energies .",
    "this can either be achieved by adapting ( refitting ) the parameterization of @xcite or by externally applying an enhancement factor of the imaginary part which decreases with increasing energy .",
