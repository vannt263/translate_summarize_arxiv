    "<S> the presence of these two types of backaction ( pure dephasing versus eigenstate information ) draws into question the role of information . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , a recent proposal @xcite has introduced the concept of a `` quasi - measurement''an interaction with the environment that does not necessarily accumulate information about the state  to clarify the role of wavefunction collapse in the zeno effects .    </S>",
    "<S> accordingly , we implement an alternative measurement scheme which only dephases rather than accumulates information about the qubit state . in the proposal @xcite </S>",

    "<S> , we extend this proposal to perform a dephasing - only `` measurement , '' where no information about the energy state is acquired . to do this , we apply a rotation @xmath26 on the @xmath27 transition to excite the circuit from @xmath0 to @xmath1 and then apply a second rotation @xmath28 to return the circuit to the @xmath0 state . </S>",
    "<S> these two rotations result in an accumulated berry phase @xcite on the state @xmath0 . to characterize this berry phase </S>",

    "<S> the relative phase between the two pulses is chosen from a pseudo - random number generator . because each dephasing measurement takes the circuit out of the qubit state manifold , repeated measurements change the effective decay time as shown in figure [ fig : qm]c , where the solid line indicates the expected dependence on the measured @xmath3 based on the measurement rate @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> our data show that dephasing measurements induce zeno effects in a comparable way to projective @xmath11 measurements .    to probe how the repeated measurements alter the qubit  bath coupling we perform continuous wave spectroscopy of the qubit transition . </S>",

    "<S> when random measurement perturbations broaden the emitter s resonance profile , the emitter samples more or less of the bath depending on the spectral density of states . </S>",
    "<S> counter to the original conception of zeno effects , the measurements that induce broadening of the emitter s transition do not need to acquire information about the system energy state , but should simply dephase the quantum state .    </S>",
