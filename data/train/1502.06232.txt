    "the laser - driven ion acceleration from ultrashort ultraintense ( usui ) laser pulse interaction with various solid targets has been studied actively for applications ranging from basic particle physics [ 1 ] , bench - top particle accelerators[2]-[4 ] , medical therapies[3 ] , fast ignition of inertial controlled fusion ( icf)[4][5 ] , etc . up to now , several mechanisms for accelerating ions have been proposed , such as target normal sheath acceleration(tnsa)[2][8 ] , laser breakout after - burner(boa)[9 ] , and radiation pressure acceleration(pra)[10][11 ] .",
    "many potential applications require proton and ion beams with high collimation , monoenergetic , larger particle number and intense energy density , as a result , the enhancement of beam quality becomes of intriguing interest and numerous experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted to achieve this goal[3][12]-[17 ] .    in tnsa regime , which is more stable than other ions acceleration mechanisms ,",
    "when an intense laser pulse irradiates on a thin plain target , a large number of electrons are accelerated by the incident laser and then transport to the target backside , forming an electron cloud and thus a strong electrostatic charge - separation field there . a population of protons near the rear surface of the target then are pulled out and accelerated into the backside vacuum by this so - called target normal sheath electric field[2][18 ] .",
    "one of the challenges here is how to generate a nearly local and uniform sheath field at the target rear surface , as typically the sheath field occupies a large area and is inhomogeneous due to the divergent electrons which establish the sheath field , and more to the point , when the normally incident laser is p - polarized , in which case the electric field of the laser oscillates along the transverse direction and thus pushes electrons to move up or down to either lateral edges of the plain target and assemble there , as a consequence , the target normal sheath electric field is stronger on both the lateral edges symmetrically while relatively much weaker on the central axis , and this edge effect will get greater over time . in order to control the shape of the sheath electric field and then to obtain a collimated proton beam with high quality , several tailored structural targets and ions - doped foil targets are proposed previously[19][20 ] .    in this paper , we study a practical scheme to generate proton beams with controlled divergence and concentrated energy in tnsa regime by a usui laser illuminating the tailored hole - target , and we also employ a same single plain target without the backside hole as a comparison .",
    "two - dimension - in - space and three - dimension - in - velocity ( 2d3v ) particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the tailored hole - target in suppressing the transverse proton beam divergence by confining the sheath electric filed in the hole almost locally and uniformly and also by generating a transverse electric field to focus the protons .",
    "accordingly , the dependence of the proton beam characteristics on the target hole depth is also worthy to investigate in detail .",
    "this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the target model and the simulation parameters . for comparison , both of the single plain and tailored hole - target are considered . in sec .",
    "iii , our simulation results are presented , from which one can see the robust improvement on the beam divergence and protons energy intensity by using the tailored hole - target .",
    "the dependence of proton beam divergence on depth of the hole is examined thoroughly in sec .",

    "the front side of the plain target is located at @xmath9 , of which thickness is @xmath10 and width is @xmath11 . in order to include the prepulse effect , we employ a linear density gradient in @xmath12 at the laser illumination surface .",

    "the optimal hole diameter is of the order of the laser spot size and proton beam divergence and energy characteristics have little dependence on pulse duration , so we fix the laser parameters and hole diameter all through this paper .    the conceptual diagram of the single plain target and the tailored hole - target studied in our simulation .",

    "the main acceleration mechanism we consider here is tnsa , which means the shape of sheath electric field determined by the accelerated hot electron cloud spread is vital to the quaity of the subsequently generated proton beam .",

    "[ figure : fig2](a)-(c ) for the plain target , at early time , say @xmath30 , the maximum sheath field @xmath31 is centralized around the laser incident axis with a diameter of about @xmath32 and the further away from the central axis , the weaker @xmath27 .",
    "however , as the accelerated hot electrons are further exploding into the vacuum , say at @xmath33 , @xmath27 is expanding along both the transverse and longitudinal directions as well , resulting in a wider and longer bell shape . what s more , @xmath27 is still y - axial symmetric but is stronger ( @xmath34 ) at the target top and bottom edges than that ( @xmath35 ) in the region nearer around laser axis . at later time",
    "points @xmath36 , @xmath27 has expanded more decentralized , and the maximum sheath field is obviously located at the top and bottom edges of the plain target , leaving the centraxonial @xmath27 much more weaker . in addition , because the incident laser is p - polarized , the electric field of the laser pushes electrons along the transverse direction , and thus makes the hot electron denser at the edges .",
    "add it all up , the transverse edge effect of @xmath27 is one of the reasons which lead to proton beam divergence and large spot size .",
    "as shown in figs .",
    "[ figure : fig2](d)-(f ) , in the case of the hole - target , the transverse edge effect of @xmath27 is suppressed by the horizontal ramparts made of al , which forces @xmath27 to distribute uniformly and locally in the hole , and from our simulation results , we obtain @xmath37 at @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the reason why the hole can help to eliminate the edge effect is the accelerated hot electrons can not transport freely in the closely - behind al ramparts , in which denser electrons prohibit them from going forward and thus @xmath27 can not be established in these regions like that of the plain target .",
    "distributions of cycle - averaged sheath electric fields @xmath27 at @xmath29 for plain ( a)-(c ) and hole - target ( d)-(f ) , respectively .",

    "as the shape of @xmath27 evolves over time , we pick up three snap shots of sectional view ( the crosssection is at @xmath43 ) at the same time points mentioned above , and the results are presented in figure [ figure : fig3 ] .",
    "compared with @xmath27 of the plain target ( red line ) , which is much broader and has two sharp corners almost symmetrical about the central axis ( @xmath44 ) , @xmath27 of the tailored hole - target ( black line ) is limited just tightly around central axis , being local and uniform . moreover , for the single plain target , as we discussed above , the two corners of @xmath27 are moving outwards to the top and bottom edges of the plain target and meantime the central part of @xmath27 is getting weaker .",
    "the maximum @xmath27 shown in figure [ figure : fig3 ] is smaller for the tailored hole - target due to less accelerated hot electrons produced in the hole than that in vacuum of the plain target rear side .",
    "sectional view for the crosssection located at @xmath43 at time points ( a ) @xmath30 , ( b ) @xmath33 , ( c ) @xmath45 , red line is for the plain target and black line is for the tailored hole - target .",
    "the electric fields @xmath27 are cycle - averaged and normalized by @xmath38 . ]",
    "the tailored hole - target not only has an advantage over the plain one in controlling the shape of @xmath27 , but also has a transverse electric field @xmath46 induced in the hole which does not exist in the case of the plain target .",
    "as one can see in figure [ figure : fig4 ] , @xmath46 has opposite directions in the hole , that is , in the upper side @xmath46 is negatively along @xmath47 while in the lower side @xmath46 is positively along @xmath48 , thus this transverse field tends to focus and confine the protons in the transverse direction as a tight bunch .",
    "the transverse electric field can reach as large as @xmath49 according to our simulation results , which is approximately consistent with @xmath50 where we estimate @xmath51 as the debye length of accelerated hot electrons with temperature @xmath52 .",

    "the electric fields @xmath46 are cycle - averaged and normalized by @xmath38 . ]    in order to have a clear understanding about the energy distribution characteristics of generated protons in the rear side of the targets , we use figure [ figure : fig5 ] to show the distribution of proton energy density in the region beyond @xmath9 at time @xmath45 for both plain and tailored hole - target .",
    "one can ensure that thanks to both the reshaped @xmath27 and the induced transverse electric field @xmath46 , protons produced by the tailored hole - target have been confined in the hole with energy more greatly concentrated compared with that of the plain target .",

    "in section ii when declaring the simulation parameters , we fix diameter of the hole @xmath56 and leave depth @xmath14 as the only geometric variable for good reason . here",
    "we investigate the dependence of proton beam divergence and energy feature on @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ figure : fig6 ] demonstrates the rear sheath field @xmath27 at @xmath45 for the single plain target and tailored hole - target with different depth @xmath57 , which are given respectively by lines in different colors as stated in legend .",
    "as we have proved above , there is severe edge effect for the plain target , leading to proton divergence .",
    "all the hole - targets have their sheath electric fields limited in the inner hole , except for the difference that the field distributions are distinct marginally ( at hole inner margin @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) and in the hole . in the case of @xmath60 ,",
    "marginal sheath field is the strongest among the four targets , which may result in more accelerated electrons in marginal region and thus large beam divergence ; and further more , `` marginal effect '' makes @xmath27 fluctuate more wildly in the hole . for @xmath61 case , we still see the `` marginal effect '' , but a little eased .",
    "the most optimal shape of sheath electric field for accelerating protons is in the case of @xmath26 , where the marginal fields are almost suppressed to equal the level of the electric field in the hole , and therefore , the sheath field @xmath27 is reshaped to be uniform and centralized . from our simulation results , we ensure that @xmath26 is the optimal depth parameter among these cases , for too shallow the `` marginal effect '' affects @xmath27 significantly .",
    "distribution of rear sheath electric fields @xmath27 for the single plain target and tailored hole - target with different depth @xmath57 at @xmath45 , where the black line is for the plain target , red , green and blue lines are for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",

    "now we focus on the dependence of proton beam divergence on depth of the hole .",
    "figure [ figure : fig8 ] shows the divergence spectrum of accelerated forward - going protons in the rear side at @xmath45 for the single plain target and tailored hole - target with different depth @xmath57 . here",
    "divergence angle is defined by the following formula @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are protons transverse and longitudinal relativistic momentum respectively .",
    "one can see clearly that the proton beam from the plain target has two divergence angle peaks in @xmath68 and @xmath69 , while proton beam from the hole - target with @xmath60 has an obvious angular deviation from the central axis and one angle peak in @xmath70 , and proton beams from the hole - targets with @xmath61 and @xmath26 each has angle peaks in @xmath71 and @xmath72 respectively .",
    "although the hole - target with @xmath61 has a smaller peak divergence angle , on the whole its divergence spectrum shape is fatter than hole - target with @xmath26 .",
    "the accelerated proton number in the case @xmath26 from our simulation results is about @xmath73",

    "the divergence angle is in unit of degree , and the proton number is indicated in the vertical axis . ]",
    "a rough estimation of the hole depth ranges depending on @xmath1 of the incident laser . ]",
    "so far , we have learned the primary function of the ramparts of the hole - target is to eliminate the electric sheath field `` edge effect '' , confine the accelerated hot electrons and focus the subsequent protons , and we have demonstrated the dependence of proton beam divergence on depth of the hole , and next , the depth range should be figured out .",
    "as we know , the accelerated hot electrons temperature is @xmath74 , and according to the following formula @xmath75 we can estimate the minimum depth of the hole should be the local plasma scale length @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the ion sound speed , @xmath78 is the longitudinal accelerating field and @xmath79 is taken to be the incident laser duration .",
    "now we make some assumptions about the maximum value of @xmath14 .",
    "wilks et al . found that protons gain energy proportional to the electron temperature[2 ] , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is somewhere between 2 and 12 , depending on the model , and from our simulation results",
    ", we can roughly estimate @xmath82 . as a result",
    ", we can obtain @xmath83 .",
    "figure [ figure : fig9 ] shows the rough range of hole depth , and we can see using our simulation parameters , @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "it is reasonable that for incident laser with large @xmath1 , one should use hole - targets with longer ramparts , and the minimum depth shows little change .",
    "in conclusion , proton acceleration in tnsa regime using a tailored hole - target has been investigated by 2d3v pic simulations . it is found that proton beams with more intense energy density and much smaller divergence angle can be produced from suitably picked hole depth compared with those from the single plain target .",
    "the dependence of proton beam divergence on depth of the hole is also investigated .",
    "we give a rough estimation of the depth ranges depending on @xmath1 of the incident laser , and all the simulation results demonstrate that as long as the depth of the hole roughly satisfies the effective action range of the hole target ramparts , the tailored hole - target works effectively .",
