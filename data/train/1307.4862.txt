    "josephson effects appear in sns junctions where two superconductors ( s ) are electrically coupled through a non - superconducting material ( n ) @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism is the andreev reflection that converts a cooper pair in s into two phase - correlated electrons in n @xcite .    at zero voltage",
    ", the appearance of coherent andreev bound states leads to a non - dissipative supercurrent through the junction and a mini - gap in the density of states ( dos ) of the normal metal . in the case of diffusive junctions and when the length of the normal part @xmath0 is longer than the superconducting phase coherence length , both the supercurrent and the mini - gap scale with the thouless energy given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the diffusive constant of the normal metal .    at finite voltage",
    ", the nonequilibrium sub - gap current is governed by multiple andreev reflections ( mar ) . in this regime , mar s successively raise a quasiparticle s energy until it reaches the superconducting gap @xmath3 . due to the superconductor density of states singularity at the gap edge ,",
    "mar s lead to a sub - gap structure in the junction differential conductance for @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 being an integer .",
    "this structure can be observed in diffusive sns junctions where the diffusion time through the junction is much smaller than the inelastic scattering time .",
    "in addition to this sub - gap quasiparticle transport , josephson currents also appear in a diffusive sns junction .",
    "however , during the diffusion of an andreev pair through the junction , phase coherence is maintained only if the energy of the electron or the hole compared to the superconductor chemical potential is smaller than the thouless energy @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the josephson current can be indirectly revealed under microwave irradiation .",
    "shapiro steps @xcite in the current - voltage characteristics show up when the superconducting phase difference oscillation frequency @xmath7 matches the microwave frequency or some multiple of it .",
    "the mere existence of shapiro steps and therefore the josephson currents essentially requires a quasi - static superconducting phase difference , a diffusion time smaller than the inverse of the josephson frequency @xmath7 , or equivalently @xmath8 .",
    "more recently , multi - terminal junctions started to be investigated and brought a wealth of new properties , among which several remain to be experimentally uncovered .",
    "when two normal conductors are closely connected to a superconducting reservoir , crossed andreev reflections ( car ) can inject two phase - correlated particles , one in each conductor , which amounts to split a cooper pair into two entangled electrons @xcite .",
    "this only occurs when the distance between the two normal conductors is smaller than the superconducting coherence length .",
    "another situation is met in mesoscopic three - terminal josephson junctions in which a single normal conductor is connected to three superconducting contacts @xcite .",
    "the transport properties then depend on two independent ( phase or voltage ) variables .",
    "therefore , in addition to usual josephson processes coupling two terminals , new mechanisms are expected that connect all three reservoirs .",
    "several theoretical predictions have been made for such systems @xcite .",
    "nonlocal mar should show up in the so - called incoherent mar regime where the dwell time exceeds the coherence time @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the coherent regime where several mar s can occur within the coherence time is also very interesting .",
    "shapiro - like resonances in the absence of external microwave have been predicted whenever two josephson frequencies match @xcite . on similar grounds",
    ", the production of non - local quartets , as pairs of correlated cooper pairs , has been proposed as a new dissipationless transport mechanism , which is phase - coherent despite the non - equilibrium conditions @xcite .",
    "this present work reports on a new experimental study of such phenomena .    in this article",
    ", we report about electronic sub - gap transport in three - terminal josephson junctions made upon a piece of diffusive normal metal connected to three superconducting reservoirs .",
    "the junctions are all phase - coherent as their length is smaller than the single particle phase coherence length @xmath9 , and in the long junction regime , e.g. the thouless energy is much smaller than the superconducting gap .",
    "they are also rather symmetric and with a high transparency at every sn interface leading to a large sub - gap andreev current .",
    "compared to a pair of two - terminal junctions , additional sub - gap structures are observed over a wide voltage range , well above the thouless energy in a regime where one does not expect the presence of strong josephson currents .    in the following , section ii contains the experimental details and reports the sub - gap anomalies .",
    "section iii is devoted to a physical discussion of the possible interpretations .",
    "section iv concludes with perspectives .",
    "the samples we have studied have been fabricated by shadow mask evaporation technique ( see scanning electron microscope sem images in fig [ measurement ] and [ separated ] ) .",
    "copper and aluminum were evaporated at different angles through a pmma / maa bilayer mask in an ultra - high vacuum chamber .",
    "the evaporation of a thin cu - layer of 50 nm thickness was followed immediately by the evaporation of thick al electrodes of thickness 500 nm without breaking the vacuum , leading to highly transparent and uniform sn interfaces .",

    ", we get a thouless energy @xmath13 .",
    "this value is confirmed by fitting the temperature dependence of the critical current between two of the superconducting contacts @xcite .",
    "the superconducting aluminum energy gap is @xmath14 @xcite .",

    "the sem image shows a three - terminal junction sample with a t - shape geometry.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    three - terminal differential resistances were measured using an experimental set - up specially designed to perform highly - sensitive measurements of current average and fluctuations in low - impedance nano - devices at very low temperature @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ measurement ] .",
    "the experiment operates down to 30 mk and is equipped with 3 commercial squids as current amplifiers .",
    "each device terminal is connected to the input coil of a squid in series with a macroscopic resistor with a low resistance @xmath19 .",
    "the measurement scheme consists in sending an current modulation @xmath20 on the reference side and recording the current in each branch of the circuit .",
    "the differential resistance @xmath21 then reads :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the current measured in squid @xmath24 or @xmath25 . for all the samples studied here , @xmath26 and @xmath27 give the same behavior . in order to explore the non - linear response in the @xmath28 plane ,",
    "two current sources were used and the voltage differences @xmath29 and @xmath30 were measured with two room - temperature differential voltage amplifiers . in practice , @xmath31 is first set to a fixed value and @xmath32 ramped with current steps of 1 or 2 @xmath33a .",
    "when the ramp is finished , @xmath31 is increased by a larger current step ( typically 20 @xmath33a ) and @xmath32 ramped again .",
    "the density of measurement points is therefore not uniform , which explains the dotted features observed in the contour plots .",
    "of a three - terminal device with separated normal metal parts in the ( @xmath34 ) plane at @xmath35 = 100 mk .",

[ separated ] ) . for this sample geometry ,",
    "the separation holds as the cu underneath the central electrode , although being continuous , is thin enough that the locally induced gap is that of the superconducting gap @xmath3 of aluminum .",
    "only two anomalies corresponding to josephson effects at @xmath37 and @xmath38 are detected .",
    "this confirms the absence of multi - terminal effects in the presence of a central electrode with a width ( @xmath39 900 nm ) larger than the superconducting coherence length @xmath40 , as already reported @xcite .",
    "such a device therefore behaves like two independent sns junctions in parallel .    here and in the following , the voltage range was limited to @xmath41 because going beyond would require a current close to the superconducting electrodes depairing current @xcite . as the investigated voltage range remains well below the superconductor energy gap , the number of multiple andreev reflections ( @xmath42 ) necessary for a quasiparticle to reach the superconducting gap is more than 8 , which would correspond to a total diffusion time much larger than the inelastic scattering time .",
    "this defines a strong interaction regime in which mar cycles are interrupted by inelastic events .",
    "in such a bath of thermalized hot quasiparticles carrying an elevated effective temperature , the mar - induced steps in the energy distribution function are completely washed out @xcite and hence the sub - gap structures related to the singularity of the dos at the s / n interface can not be observed .",
    "we have investigated a novel type of three - terminal junction with a t - shape normal conductor connecting three superconducting electrodes @xmath43 and @xmath44 whose sem image is shown in fig . [ measurement ] . here",
    ", @xmath45 corresponds to the upper central superconducting electrode , @xmath46 and @xmath44 the left and right superconducting electrodes respectively . the differential resistance @xmath26 is shown in fig . [ tri ] at @xmath47 .",
    "for this geometry , we expect three josephson couplings @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , where the two indexes label the two involved superconducting terminals . in fig .",
    "[ tri ] , the couplings @xmath48 and @xmath49 are clearly observed at @xmath51 and @xmath38 respectively . as expected from the definition of the differential resistance ( eq . [ eq : rdiff ] ) , the josephson coupling @xmath48 appears as a dip in the differential resistance @xmath26 whereas the @xmath49 shows up as a peak .",
    "we have checked that the opposite behavior is observed when plotting @xmath27 .     of a t - shape junction in the ( @xmath34 ) plane for various temperatures .",
    "at @xmath35 = 200 mk , the data have been measured for the entire voltage range .",
    "for the other temperatures , only the upper half with @xmath52 has been measured and the graph symmetrized for clarity.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we can see in figure [ tri ] that the coupling @xmath50 does not show up at @xmath53 . in the actual experiment ,",
    "the -modulation was sent to the central electrode @xmath45 so that the separation of this current into the two branches @xmath46 and @xmath44 is not sensitive to the coupling @xmath50 .",
    "we have verified in a similar sample that the latter coupling is indeed revealed when sending the -modulation through @xmath46 or @xmath44 .",
    "in addition to the two josephson features discussed above , three other lines are clearly visible at @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 . notice that in a t - shape geometry , the three superconducting reservoirs are equivalent , meaning that the voltages @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath57 are also equivalent .",
    "we can thus state that these three lines all originate from the same type of mechanism involving the three superconducting contacts .",
    "the observation of this sub - gap structure in the low - bias differential conductance of a three - terminal superconducting hybrid device is the main experimental finding of the present work .    in a second step ,",
    "we have studied the temperature dependence of the differential resistance of the t - shape device .",
    "the results are plotted at the bottom of fig .",
    "apart from the central part that is related to the josephson effect at very low bias , the sub - gap structure does not evolve much with temperature .",
    "all lines are found to be clearly visible up to 700 mk and 40 @xmath58 .",
    "this confirms that , in the voltage range under investigation , the electronic temperature is well above the bath temperature @xcite .    to further investigate these new features ,",
    "we have plotted some line - traces perpendicular to the @xmath54 line ( fig .",
    "[ traces]a ) , to the @xmath37 line ( fig .",
    "[ traces]b ) and to the @xmath38 line ( fig .",
    "[ traces]c ) for various levels of the applied voltages as indicated by the color lines in figure [ tri ] .",
    "as expected , the differential resistance @xmath26 appears as a josephson resonance around @xmath37 for any value of @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "[ traces]b ) .",
    "the same type of response is observed when plotting @xmath27 around @xmath38 for any value of @xmath29 ( fig .",
    "[ traces]c ) .",
    "it turns out that when plotting the overall sample differential resistance recalculated by considering the two branches a and b as being in parallel ( @xmath59 ) as a function of the voltage @xmath60 , the observed profile of the sub - gap structure across the @xmath54 line is also in striking resemblance with a josephson resonance .",
    "this observation suggests that the additional anomalies are due to coherent effects involving the three terminals .",
    "moreover , it is important to notice that the features discussed here are rather robust and constant with respect to the applied voltage . more precisely , as seen in the fig .",
    "[ traces ] , those persist at energies well above the thouless energy .",
    "therefore , the scheme to explain the additional features seen at non zero @xmath29 and @xmath30 and that involve the three terminals , must also be robust against voltage induced dephasing towards all the branches of the device .    , for several values of @xmath61 ,",

    "the color code follows that of the lines in figure [ tri ] .",
    "the data are shifted for clarity except the lower ones.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]",
    "sub - gap structures reminding the ones observed here were predicted and observed in the conductance of coupled but separated junctions @xcite . in this case , two josephson currents coexist with frequencies @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "when the two frequencies match , e.g. @xmath64 , down - mixing through the non - linear response of the device can generate sub - gap structures similar to shapiro steps . in our experimental scheme with a low resistive environment ( @xmath65 )",
    ", this coupling could be obtained through the external circuit . yet , no anomalies are observed in the sample with separate junctions , despite the fact that both samples have exactly the same circuit environment .",
    "in fact , due to the squid inductances and the wiring , the external impedances at the josephson frequency are much larger than the resistances of the bias resistors , preventing any josephson current to circulate in the external circuit .",
    "therefore , the relevant coupling can only be within the sample itself .    an extended resistively shunted junction ( rsj ) model generalizing that of ref",
    "@xcite could provide a phenomenological description .",
    "it involves a triangular josephson array , shunted by the corresponding normal state resistances , that account for the quasiparticle processes within the n region .",
    "with such a model , the observation of strong resonances requires sizeable josephson currents , whereas they are known to decrease when the voltages @xmath66 exceed the thouless energy @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "thus , even if the voltage decrease of josephson currents is expected to be progressive , it should definitively lead to a reduction of the resonance for such a variation of @xmath67 .",
    "this is very much in contrast to what is observed in fig .",
    "[ traces ] .",
    "in addition to be quantitatively inconsistent , such an rsj model is only phenomenological .",
    "due to the long coherence time , transport in the present experimental conditions is truly mesoscopic and the explanation of the observations requires a phase - coherent microscopic mechanism taking place in the normal region .",
    "one might consider a more microscopic approach and seek how the possible josephson oscillations can synchronize together to yield a constant component .",
    "such a problem indeed reminds the one considered in refs .",
    "@xcite . in a clean sns junction polarized with a voltage @xmath68 , oscillations with a frequency double of the basic josephson frequency @xmath69",
    "are generated and show up under microwave irradiation as half - integer shapiro steps .",
    "this was explained by argaman @xcite within a semi - phenomenological description in which the both the andreev levels and their steady state distribution oscillate at the josephson frequency .",
    "the argument applies in the adiabatic regime in which the thouless energy is much larger than the applied voltage .",
    "the same argument could be applied to our three - terminal josephson junctions for which the oscillating josephson current at a frequency @xmath70 between two of the three terminals could be modulated by oscillation of the distribution function due to the josephson coupling between two other terminals at a frequency @xmath71 . in that case , the second harmonic response obtained by argaman et al .",
    "@xcite in the case of a two terminal sns junctions , transposes into a response at a frequency @xmath72 giving rise to dc features when @xmath73 .",
    "again , the conditions for such a scenario to apply are the same as in refs .",
    "@xcite , e.g. that the voltage is small enough to allow an adiabatic approximation both in the current components and in the andreev state distribution .",
    "the first one requires that @xmath74 , the mini - gap scale , and the second is even more restrictive , @xmath75 .",
    "for instance , in lehnert et al.s experiment , the frequency doubling is observed for @xmath76 , an order of magnitude below the thouless energy @xmath77 .",
    "but in the experiment reported in our work , it is the other way around !",
    "the sub - gap anomalies are observed for @xmath78 _ above _ @xmath6 , up to @xmath79 , only limited by experimental constraints , and without any sign of decay .",
    "thus , though qualitatively appealing , the above mechanism do not provide a good explanation for our experimental results .",
    "the limitation of the synchronization scenario is the voltage induced dephasing suffered by the two electrons of each of the cooper pairs transferred between two superconducting terminals .",
    "let us instead show that the quartet mechanism , proposed for clean bijunctions @xcite , can be generalized to a diffusive system and is fully robust against dephasing at voltages much higher than @xmath6 .",
    "the main idea is that two cooper pairs are transferred in a single and fully energy - conserving quantum process in which the two pairs cross in an entangled way , by exchanging an electron between them .    to describe this mechanism ,",
    "let us consider a piece of diffusive normal metal @xmath80 connected to three superconducting reservoirs ( @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath44 ) whose potentials are set to @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 respectively , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ quartet ] .",
    "two cooper pairs from @xmath45 can be simultaneous split in n , each of them in two electrons with opposite energies ( with respect to the fermi energy ) that we define , without loosing generality , as @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "when these energies are larger than the thouless energy @xmath6 , the two electrons of each pair do not follow the same trajectory .",
    "nevertheless , if the energy @xmath86 is small compared to @xmath6 , the electron _ of the first pair _ at @xmath87 can follow the same phase - coherent trajectory as the electron _ of the second pair _ at @xmath88 and for instance , reach @xmath46 . since @xmath82 ,",
    "the two particles have relative opposite energies @xmath89 and can recombine as a cooper pair in @xmath46 .",
    "the same mechanism holds for the two other particles at @xmath44 . in the whole process ,",
    "two cooper pairs from @xmath45 are split altogether to create two spatially - separated cooper pairs in @xmath46 and @xmath44 , a so - called quartet , named hereafter @xmath90 as it originates from @xmath45 .",
    "the key point favoring the quartet mechanism is that the coherence of each andreev pair reaching @xmath46 or @xmath44 can be satisfied at any voltage @xmath91 , even when @xmath92 .",
    "considering again the four electrons emitted from the two split pairs , two of them have energies @xmath93 ( pair ( a ) ) and the two others @xmath94 ( pair ( b ) ) ( see fig . [ quartet ] ) .",
    "as the quartet mechanism is a quantum process , the sum of all the possible diffusion probabilities has to be considered altogether . among those , the situation where pair ( a ) propagates towards @xmath46 and pair ( b ) towards @xmath44 is phase coherent and independent of the applied voltage @xmath68",
    ". indeed , the phase difference accumulated by the pair ( a ) ( pair ( b ) ) scales as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the diffusion time from @xmath45 to @xmath97 .",
    "the quartet mode is therefore a fully coherent d.c .",
    "process taking place in the mesoscopic @xmath80 region and involving four andreev reflections .",
    "this is very different from the scheme where two electrons of a single cooper pair propagate towards @xmath46 or @xmath44 . in that case , the two electrons of a single pair have energies @xmath84 or @xmath85 and the accumulated phase difference scales with @xmath98 .",
    "the effect of such trajectories has , therefore , a vanishing contribution to the electronic transport when @xmath99 .",
    "let us note that the quartet response bears some resemblance with mar s @xcite , with two important differences .",
    "first , the total energy balance of the process is zero , and second , it does not lead to quasiparticle transport above the superconducting gap .",

    "two cooper pairs are split simultaneously at @xmath45 with one electron of each pair propagating towards @xmath46 and @xmath44 where , under the appropriate energy condition ( @xmath100 ) , they recombine to create two separated cooper pairs.,scaledwidth=40.0% ]    in this quartet description , the line at @xmath54 corresponds to the production of quartets @xmath90 , whereas the line at @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) originates from quartets @xmath101 ( @xmath102 ) produced in @xmath46 ( @xmath44 ) towards @xmath45 and @xmath44 ( @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) . at lowest order ,",
    "the quartet mechanism requires only four andreev reflections , much less than needed in the same voltage range for a quasiparticle to reach the gap edge in a usual mar process , which makes the quartet mechanism much more robust to inelastic collisions .",
    "the above arguments can be substantiated by a microscopic calculation ( appendix a ) , valid under the separation of energy scales @xmath103 .",
    "one uses non - equilibrium keldysh green s functions and performs a lowest order calculation in tunnel amplitudes at the different sn interfaces , inspired by ref .",
    "the quartet current is calculated using a hamiltonian formalism and an essential step is averaging over disorder .",
    "the current appears as a sum of contributions , each being a product of six propagating amplitudes associated to the diagrammatic lines in fig .",

    "in fact , two lines are correlated by disorder provided their energies are closer than @xmath6 .",
    "it results that the averaged product of six amplitudes can be decoupled into three factors .",
    "one corresponds to the diffusion of an andreev pair from @xmath45 to @xmath46 , at energies @xmath104 , with @xmath105 , another one to the diffusion of an andreev pair from @xmath45 to @xmath44 , at energies @xmath106 and the third to the anomalous diffusion within @xmath45 that achieves andreev reflection at energies @xmath78 , @xmath107 @xcite .",

    "this calculation shows that the ratio between the quartet maximum current at a bias @xmath68 and the single junction critical current at zero bias is @xmath119 , which is not necessarily small .",

    "in conclusion , we reported about new sub - gap structures in the differential conductance of a metallic nanostructure with three superconducting reservoirs , a so - called bijunction .",
    "the existence of such anomalies well above the thouless energy points towards a new and fully coherent mechanism , different from the synchronization of separated josephson junctions , or any mesoscopic generalization of such a process .",
    "our results are consistent with the production of non - local quartets , as a resonant pair of cooper pairs , splitting and recombining within the n region .",
    "therefore , our results provide a convincing experimental evidence for ( double ) crossed andreev reflections in metallic superconducting / normal metal hybrid three - terminal nanostructures with a signature in the electronic response at low temperature much larger than in metallic cooper pair splitters using only one superconducting reservoir .",

    "those energies correspond to the transitions between @xmath5 and @xmath166 indices ( see eq .",
    "( [ chain ] ) ) induced by the hopping matrix elements . a summation over the labels @xmath133 ( @xmath167 ) and @xmath168 at the interfaces has to be carried out .",
    "this procedure is justified to describe extended contacts at lowest order in the tunnel amplitudes .",
    "as far as the applied voltages are small enough compared to the gap , the energy dependence of the green s functions can be discarded .",
    "the next step is to perform disorder averaging .",
    "a contribution such as @xmath169 should be replaced by its average @xmath170 over disorder in the @xmath80 region and in the superconductors .",
    "expression ( [ amplitudes ] ) contains several amplitudes , matrices in @xmath171 , numbers in @xmath80 .",
    "first , @xmath172 , @xmath173 yielding density of states factors in @xmath46 and @xmath44 .",
    "second , the product @xmath174 of amplitudes in @xmath45 , at energies close to @xmath78 ( electrons ) and @xmath107 ( holes ) that can be averaged separately .",
    "it describes the anomalous diffusion of a quasiparticle within @xmath45 , yielding andreev - reflection at the @xmath175 interface @xcite .",
    "third , the product @xmath176 of amplitudes in @xmath80 .",
    "the two first amplitudes contribute at energies @xmath104 and the two others at energies @xmath106 .",
    "we assume that @xmath177 , and use the fact that the coherence between electron and hole trajectories is limited by the thouless energy",
    ". then it is justified to decouple @xmath178 .",
    "this amounts to separately averaging the diffusive trajectories connecting @xmath46 to @xmath45 , and @xmath44 to @xmath45 , relying on energy rather than spatial separation .",
    "then one obtains : @xmath179 with @xmath180 and where the characteristic phase dependence of the quartet mode stems from the four involved andreev reflections , one at @xmath46 , one at @xmath44 and two at @xmath45 .",
    "a product of three probabilities appear : @xmath181 for electron - hole ( andreev pair ) diffusion from @xmath46 to @xmath45 , @xmath182 for the anomalous diffusion inside @xmath45 , and @xmath183 for the andreev pair diffusion from @xmath45 to @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath182 tracks the probability of two andreev reflections at @xmath45 .",
    "the andreev pair diffusion modes @xmath184 showing out in eq .",
    "[ eq : decouplage ] are obtained by a summation of the ladder diagrams @xcite , standard in the diffusion problem .",
    "the diffusion probability on a distance @xmath185 is @xmath186 and its space fourier transform is proportional to @xmath187 importantly , @xmath188 has no dependence on @xmath68 , in the @xmath189 limit .",
    "most importantly , the quartet current appears even if the voltage is larger than the thouless energy .",
    "the above principle for the quartet current calculation can be benchmarked on the simpler case of an @xmath108 junction at equilibrium .",
    "one considers the dc - josephson current in a @xmath190 junction , and evaluate it on the same line as above , by a expansion of the current to fourth order in the transparencies .",
    "then the fourier transform of the diffusion probability associated to the andreev pair modes @xmath191 in @xmath80 is also given by @xmath188 .",
    "for comparison , in a @xmath192 junction with the mode @xmath193 , the diffusion probability is @xmath194 , thus without the @xmath195 factor in the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : p0 ] ) .    depending on the diffusion taking place in n or s , this",
    "results after integration over @xmath196 : @xmath197 where the thouless energy for a junction of length @xmath185 is @xmath198 .",
    "notice that @xmath199 decays on the effective coherence length in @xmath45 ( taking into account disorder ) @xcite .",
    "the quartet current calculation follows from equations ( a3-a6 ) .",
    "@xmath200 where @xmath201 is the average number of channels , due to integration on one of the interfaces of @xmath202 .",
    "the integration volume @xmath203 accounts for the absorbing boundary conditions for diffusion in the reservoirs @xcite ( @xmath204 is the fermi wavelength ) .",
    "integration over the surface of @xmath45 accounts for the range @xmath118 of the andreev reflection and yields a total factor @xmath205 for the integrated andreev probability in @xmath45 .",
    "integration over frequency yields the factor @xmath6 , each diffusion probability contributes by a factor @xmath206 .",
    "one finally obtains : @xmath207 a yet unknown prefactor has to be added in eq .",
    "( [ eq : iq ] ) , which is expected to be of the same order as that involved in the case of a @xmath108 junction .",
    "the conductance @xmath112 refers to the crossed andreevreflection ( car ) in a @xmath113 hybrid structure .",
    "the maximum quartet current is thus naturally obtained by multiplying the car conductance by the thouless energy that sets the coherence of andreev pairs on both branches a , b of the bi - junction .",
