    "berry phase  @xcite or geometric phase , which does not have classical correspondence , becomes a focus point in modern physics .",
    "it describes a phase factor gained by the wavefunction after the system undergoes an adiabatic and cyclic evolution , which reflects the topological properties  @xcite of the state space of the system and has untrivial connections with the character of the system  @xcite , especially with the entanglement  @xcite .",
    "recently , the berry phase was introduced into quantum computation to construct a universal quantum logic gates that may be robust to certain kinds of errors  @xcite .",
    "cavity qed is an important solid - state system for implementing quantum computation , and is studied extensively . in the theory of cavity qed , the jaynes - cummings  @xcite model ( jcm )",
    "is recognized as the simplest and most effective model on the interaction between radiation and matter , which can be solved exactly . as an important theoretical model",
    ", jcm has led to many nontrivial predictions such as collapse - revival phenomenon  @xcite , squeezing  @xcite , antibunching  @xcite , chaos  @xcite , and trapping states  @xcite , etc . furthermore , despite the simplicity of jcm , it is of great significance because recent technologies enabled scientists to experimentally realize this rather idealized model  @xcite and to verify some of the theoretical predictions .",
    "stimulated by the success of the jcm , many people extends this model to explore new quantum effects .",
    "one simple way of extending is considering multiple atoms and multiple modes field instead of single atom and single mode field  @xcite .",
    "another way is considering the interactions between field and medium and fields itself , such as a cavity filled with kerr medium . introducing of kerr nonlinearity in the system hamiltonian will cause various nonlinear effects , so it attracts much attentions of scientists  @xcite .",
    "one of the many applications of these nonlinear effects is to produce entangled states  @xcite , which is of extensively applications in quantum information , especially in quantum communication .    in this paper",
    ", we try to investigate a two - atom jaynes - cummings model in kerr medium . at first , we calculate the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the system",
    ". then we evaluate the berry phase of ground state for arbitrary photon number @xmath0 in terms of the introduction of the phase shift operator , and for comparing the phase with the entanglement we compute the von neumann entropy as a measurement of entanglement .",
    "after these tedious computation , we compare the ground state energy , berry phase and entropy , and find that there are tight connections between them .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system in the rotating wave approximation can be written as ( assuming   @xmath2 ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the creation and annihilation operators of the single mode field , @xmath6 is the transition frequency of the field , @xmath7 is the atomic transition frequency , @xmath8 is the coupling constant between these two atoms and field , @xmath9 represents the coupling of the fields induced by the kerr medium .",
    "@xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 being the excited and ground states of @xmath15 th atom , @xmath16 .",
    "by the way , there exists a conserved quantity @xmath17 for above hamiltonian , which is @xmath18 the basis of the subspace @xmath19 is @xmath20 and in that basis , the hamiltonian is written as ( in an appropriate interaction picture ) @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the detuning of the cavity field .",
    "the four eigenvalues @xmath23 and corresponding eigenstates @xmath24 have been calculated analytically .",
    "however , it is useless to present their complicated formulas here , but @xmath24 can be written simply as follows : @xmath25 when @xmath26 , the ground state energy , ie .",
    "the lowest eigenvalue of the hamiltonian for @xmath26 , as a function of detuning @xmath27 and coupling constant @xmath8 , is shown in fig .  1 .",
    "we find in the figure that when @xmath8 approaches @xmath28 there exist two discontinuity points in the derivative of the energy , and the image of the function are symmetry against the line @xmath29 to some extent .",
    "as we will see , these two points will be singularities of berry phase , and the symmetry of the energy function will also be inherited by the berry phase .",
    "obviously , the whole system are quantized , to study the geometric properties of this system we resort to the method of @xcite to evaluate the berry phase of the system by introducing a phase shift operator : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is changed from @xmath28 to @xmath32 adiabatically . then the time independent eigen equation of the system : @xmath33 is changed into @xmath34 , with @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "hence the berry phase can be evaluated according to the standard method as follows : @xmath37 for our model , the berry phase is given as @xmath38}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] apparently , @xmath39 are functions of detuning @xmath27 and coupling constant @xmath8 .",
    "so the berry phase of the ground state can be controlled by @xmath27 and @xmath8 .",
    "2 shows its image of the case @xmath26 .    just as we have mentioned before",
    ", there are two singularities when @xmath8 approaches @xmath28 for the berry phase , and the image is centrosymmetric to some extent against the intersection curve of the berry phase image and @xmath32 plane where berry phase identical equals to @xmath32 , which is adjacent to the plane @xmath29 .",
    "this result is similar to that of @xcite . in the article  @xcite ,",
    "the authors calculate the berry phase of ground state of tavis - cummings model , and it is also found that there are correspondence between the singularities of berry phase and ground state energy as well as symmetry .    to compare the berry phase with the entanglement of the system , we calculate the entropy , which can be used to measure the entanglement , using following definition : @xmath40\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the reduced density operator of @xmath42 , and @xmath42 represents the density operator of the system . generally , when the system is in a pure state @xmath43 , its density operator @xmath44 .    according to our computations ,",
    "we present the figure of entropy as a function of detuning @xmath27 and coupling constant @xmath8 when @xmath26 in fig .  3 . apparently as the figures show , there are the same two points and symmetry correspond to that of the berry phase and energy .    according to the image and our calculations",
    ", we find that for each different value of @xmath8 , there exists a maximum value for the energy of the ground state when @xmath27 satisfies following equation : @xmath45 and to our surprise , at these points where @xmath27 and @xmath8 satisfy above equation , the berry phase is right @xmath32 and the entropy of the system reached its relative minimum value when @xmath8 is near @xmath28 .",
    "the equation determines a curve in the @xmath1 plane and because this curve reflects the main character of ground state , we call it the characteristic curve of the ground state",
    ". the existence of the characteristic curves proved the tight connections between energy , berry phase and entanglement .",
    "we also considered the case @xmath46 , and find that the images of ground state energy , berry phase and entropy versus @xmath27 and @xmath8 are similar to the case @xmath26 , such as the symmetry against a line @xmath47 to some extent , and the correspondence of singularities . to illustrate this",
    ", we represent the images of ground state energy , berry phase and entropy when @xmath48 in part ( b ) s of fig .  1 , fig .  2 and fig .",
    "3 respectively . obviously , the main difference between them is that the move of the characteristic curve in the @xmath1 plane and its equation reads @xmath49 : @xmath50 fig .",
    "4 shows the characteristic curves for different values of @xmath0 .",
    "we think this result maybe owe to the fact that the berry phase and entropy are all functions of the ground state energy .",
    "in conclusion , we calculated the berry phase and entropy of a two - atom jaynes - cummings model with kerr medium , and found that there are correspondences between their singularities and symmetry . especially , there exist a class of curves in the @xmath1 plane , along which the berry phase and entropy all reach their special values like @xmath32 for berry phase .",
    "these results reflect the tight relations between the berry phase and entanglement of the system , and maybe it is caused by the fact that they are all functions of energy .",
    "some physicists are trying to measure entanglement using berry phase , and our results may be useful to them .",
