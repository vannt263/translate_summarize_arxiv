    "all sites of @xmath99 start off empty at time 0 ; each site @xmath240 waits until its two neighbours below and to the left , @xmath241 and @xmath242 , have been occupied ; it then waits for a random further amount of time which is exponential with mean 1 , and then becomes occupied itself .",

    "let @xmath252 be the time at which particle p@xmath32 overtakes hole h@xmath34 .",
    "then exactly the same recurrences hold as in the previous paragraph .",
    "once particle p@xmath32 has overtaken hole h@xmath253 , and hole h@xmath34 has been overtaken by particle p@xmath254 , particle p@xmath32 finds itself immediately on the left of hole h@xmath34 ; now an exponential amount of time with rate 1 passes before p@xmath32 overtakes h@xmath34 .",
    "this gives a one - to - one correspondence between a set of states of the ( in which all sites far enough left contain particles and all sites far enough right contain holes ) and a set of states of the growth process ( with finitely many sites of @xmath99 occupied and satisfying the condition that if @xmath240 is occupied then so are @xmath241 and @xmath242 ) .",

    "again we label holes and particles sequentially , and we let @xmath252 be the first time that particle @xmath32 is to the right of hole @xmath34 .",
    "the boundary conditions are as before , except that now @xmath261 ( since we start with particle p1 already to the right of hole h1 ) .    initial condition corresponding to the system with one second - class particle , and one of the two possible first jumps .",

    "we have @xmath266 , since initially the @xmath258paircovers hole h1 and particle p1 .",
    "thereafter , whenever the @xmath258pairjumps right ( as in figure [ jumpexamplefig ] for example ) , @xmath264 increases by one while @xmath265 remains the same ; when the @xmath258pairjumps left , @xmath264 remains the same and @xmath265 increases by one .",
    "in particular , the position @xmath21 of the second - class particle at time @xmath11 corresponds to @xmath267 ( the number of its jumps to the right minus the number of its jumps to the left ) .",
    "see figure [ jumpexamplefig ] for an example .    the evolution of the process @xmath268 can be described as follows . at time @xmath11 , the hole with label @xmath264 is immediately to the left of the particle with label @xmath265 .",
    "hence @xmath269 , but @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "the next jump in the process @xmath272 occurs either when particle with label @xmath265 jumps right , or when the hole with label @xmath264 moves left , whichever happens sooner .",
    "let @xmath273 be the @xmath147th term in the jump chain of the process @xmath272 .",
    "then @xmath274 and we have the following recurrence for the sequence @xmath273 : @xmath275 so in terms of the growth model , @xmath273 behaves as follows .",
    "we start from the initial condition in which only site @xmath107 is occupied , and @xmath274 . then at each step ,",
    "@xmath273 moves from its current position to whichever of its neighbours above and to the right is the first to be occupied .    we now describe how the sequence @xmath273 corresponds to a _ competition interface _ in the same growth model when occupied sites take one of two colours .",
    "the rules are :    * any site @xmath111 , @xmath112 takes the colour blue .",
    "* any site @xmath110 , @xmath276 takes the colour red . * for @xmath277 , the site @xmath101 takes the same colour as whichever of its neighbours @xmath102 and @xmath103 became occupied most recently .",
    "the colour of @xmath107 is not important .",
    "let @xmath278 be the set of sites that take the colour blue ( when they are eventually occupied ) and let @xmath279 be the set of set of sites that take the colour red .",
    "so @xmath280 . using a simple induction argument based on the growth rules above and on ( [ phirec ] )",
    ", we get the following characterisation which justifies the name `` competition interface '' : the set @xmath281 consists precisely of those points @xmath240 such that @xmath282 while @xmath283 .    in addition , if @xmath101 is in the competition interface ( i.e.  if @xmath284 for some @xmath147 , or equivalently if @xmath285 for some @xmath11 ) then all the points @xmath286 to its right are in @xmath278 and all the points @xmath287 above it are in @xmath279 .    see figure [ oneinterfacefig ] for an example of the competition interface .",
    "an example of the evolution of the growth model with one competition interface .",
    "the asterisks indicate those already occupied sites which form part of the competition interface .",
    "for example , since the competition interface passes from @xmath107 to @xmath108 , @xmath116 and @xmath122 , we see that @xmath263 , that @xmath288 and that @xmath289 . ]",
    "now we are finally ready to turn to the with _ two _ second - class particles , and the corresponding coexistence question in theorem [ growththm ] .",
    "in the same way that the system with one second - class particle corresponded to a growth model with one interface , the system with two second - class particles will correspond to the growth model with two interfaces .",
    "consider the starting from the state @xmath26{0.2}{\\circle}}}{\\underline { { \\circledast}}}{{\\circledast}}\\hat{{\\circle}}$ ] .",
    "we can again replace the sites containing second - class particles by pairs of sites , each containing a hole and a particle in that order .",
    "this representation works just as it did in the system with a single second - class particle , _ until the moment when one second - class particle tries to jump onto the other_. at this point we move from @xmath259{0.2}{\\circle}}}][{{\\circle}}{{\\textcolor[gray]{0.2}{\\circle}}}]$ ] to @xmath290{0.2}{\\circle}}}{{\\textcolor[gray]{0.2}{\\circle}}}$ ] and we can no longer maintain the two @xmath259{0.2}{\\circle}}}]$ ] pairs ( although in fact one can identify a * pair in the configuration @xmath260{0.2}{\\circle}}}]{{\\textcolor[gray]{0.2}{\\circle}}}$ ] and show that this * pair is in correspondence with a competition interface  see the remark below ) . in any case , up until the collision moment , the two second - class particle representation is valid , and in particular theorem [ t1](a ) tells us that the probability that such a collision is ever attempted is @xmath38 .",
    "we will again label the particles and holes sequentially .",
    "the initial state is :        in this state particle p1 has overtaken holes h1 and h2 , and particle p2 has overtaken hole h1 .",
    "hence we put @xmath291 .",
    "we will now keep track of both the @xmath258pairs : let @xmath292 and @xmath293 be respectively the labels of the hole and the particle covered by the left - hand @xmath258pair , and let @xmath294 and @xmath295 be those covered by the right - hand @xmath258pair .",
    "we have @xmath296 and @xmath297 .",
    "more generally , if at time @xmath11 the two @xmath258pairsare next to each other at time @xmath11 if and only if @xmath298 the local evolution both of @xmath299 and of @xmath300 depends on the values @xmath243 in just the same way as in the paragraph around ( [ phirec ] ) .",
    "if we define @xmath301 and @xmath302 to be the jump chains of these two processes , then each of them separately obeys the same recurrence as the process @xmath303 at ( [ phirec ] ) .",
    "now recall the rules of the growth model with two interfaces from section [ growthsec ] . in the initial condition ,",
    "the sites @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and all other sites are unoccupied .",
    "when a new site becomes occupied , its colour is chosen as follows :    * any site @xmath110 becomes dark blue .",
    "* any site @xmath111 becomes light blue .",
    "* the site @xmath113 becomes red .",
    "* a site @xmath101 , @xmath112 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 , takes the colour of whichever of its parents became occupied _",
    "more recently_.    [ [ remark-1 ] ] _ remark _ + +",
    "+ + + + + +    in fact , we have elaborated slightly by introducing both dark and light blue colours at this point for convenience , to distinguish the clusters on either side of the red cluster .",
    "the difference is convenient for the argument below , but it is not significant for the result , since we only ask whether or not the red cluster is unbounded , and we are free to identify the two blue clusters as before whenever we like .",
    "in addition , once we make the distinction between the two blue clusters , we can consider the interface between those clusters _",
    "after _ the red cluster disappears .",
    "this interface is identified by the * pair resulting from the coalescence of the * pairs related to the light - blue / red and red / dark - blue interfaces , if we make the jump from @xmath259{0.2}{\\circle}}}][{{\\circle}}{{\\textcolor[gray]{0.2}{\\circle}}}]$ ] to @xmath260{0.2}{\\circle}}}]{{\\textcolor[gray]{0.2}{\\circle}}}$ ] suggested above .    as before ,",
    "the processes @xmath304 and @xmath305 are competition interfaces , with the following properties .",
    "let @xmath306 and @xmath307 .",
    "then any point @xmath308 to the right of the lower / right interface is ( light ) blue , and any point @xmath309 which is above that interface is either red or ( dark ) blue .",
    "similarly any point @xmath310 which is above the upper / left interface is ( dark ) blue , and any point @xmath311 which is to the right of that interface is either red or ( light ) blue .",
    "an example of the evolution of the growth model with two interfaces .",
    "here we see that @xmath312 , since the lower - right interface ( indicated by asterisks ) moved to @xmath117 rather than @xmath113 but the upper - left interface ( indicated by stars ) moved to @xmath113 rather than @xmath116 . in the state",
    "shown , the two interfaces are at @xmath313 and @xmath314 .",
    "if @xmath315 is smaller than both @xmath316 and @xmath317 then both interfaces will move next to the point @xmath318 . in this case",
    "the point @xmath318 will be red but no further points will ever become red ; the red cluster will be surrounded .",
    "if , instead , one of @xmath319 or @xmath320 is occupied before @xmath318 , the red cluster will grow further , perhaps unboundedly . ]    from ( [ nexteq ] ) , we see that the moment ( if it ever happens ) when the two interfaces coincide for the first time is the first moment when the left - hand second - class particle attempts to jump onto the right - hand second - class particle .",
    "once the interfaces meet in this way , the red cluster is `` surrounded '' and can not grow any further .",
    "specifically , the last paragraph tells us that all the points above the upper - left interface will be ( dark ) blue and all those to the right of the lower - right interface will be ( light ) blue , so that no further points will be able to take on the colour red .",
    "see figure [ meetingfig ] for an example .",
    "on the other hand , suppose that the second - class particles have not yet collided , so that the interfaces have not yet coincided .",
    "even if the interfaces are already adjacent , it is still possible for them to move apart again , and any sites between the two interfaces must take the colour red ; so certainly the red cluster is not yet surrounded .",
    "see figure [ meetingfig ] for an illustrative example .",
    "hence the event that the red cluster grows unboundedly corresponds to the event that the two second - class particles never meet . from theorem",
