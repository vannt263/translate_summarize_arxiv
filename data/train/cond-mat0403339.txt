    "there is a growing interest among theoretical physicists in complex phenomena in fields departing from the traditional realm of physics research . in particular , the application of statistical physics methods to social phenomena",
    "is discussed in several reviews @xcite .",
    "one of the sociological problems that attracts much attention is the building or the lack of consensus out of some initial condition .",
    "there are several different models that simulate and analyze the dynamics of such processes in opinion formation , cultural dynamics , etc . @xcite . among all those models ,",
    "the one introduced by galam @xcite to describe the spreading of a minority opinion , incorporates basic mechanisms of social inertia , resulting in democratic rejection of social reforms initially favored by a majority . in this model , individuals gather during their social life in _ meeting cells _ of different sizes where they discuss about a topic until a final decision , in favor or against , is taken by the entire group .",
    "the decision is based on the _ majority rule _ such that everybody in the meeting cell adopts the opinion of the majority .",
    "galam introduced the idea of  social inertia \" in the form of a bias corresponding to a resistance to changes or reforms , that is : in case of tie , one of the decisions ( in the original version , the one against ) is systematically adopted .",
    "we will describe in detail the model and its main conclusions in the next sections .",
    "this simple model is able to explain why an initially minority opinion can become a majority in the long run .",
    "an interesting example was its application to the spread of rumors concerning some september 11-th opinions in france @xcite .",
    "one of the major conclusions of the mean - field - like analysis in ref.@xcite , is the existence of a threshold value @xmath2 for the initial concentration of individuals with the minority opinion ( against the social reform ) . for @xmath3",
    "every individual eventually adopts the opinion of the initial minority , so that the social reform is rejected and the _ status quo _ is maintained .",
    "a related message of this result is that a rumor spreads , although initially supported by a minority , if the society has some bias towards accepting it .",
    "galam traces back his results to dynamical effects produced by the existence of asymmetric unstable points previously considered by granovetter @xcite and schelling @xcite .",
    "these are fixed points of recursion relations describing the dynamics of the fraction of a population adopting one of two possible choices . in _ threshold models _ these relations are obtained considering a mean field type of interaction in which individual thresholds to change choice ( tolerance ) are compared with the fraction of the population that has already adopted the new choice .",
    "granovetter himself @xcite discusses that the stability of the fixed points can be changed by spatial effects , noting that the assumption that each individual is responsive to the behavior of all the others is often inappropriate . in @xcite",
    "such complete connectedness of the population seems to be circumvented by the introduction of the meeting cells .",
    "only individuals in each meeting cell interact among themselves . in this sense",
    "each meeting cell plays the role of a _ bounded neighborhood _ @xcite and it is still possible to obtain analytically recursion relations for the dynamics .",
    "however , contrary to the _ bounded neighborhood _ model of schelling , individuals enter and leave these neighborhoods randomly , and the neighborhoods do not have any characteristic identity other than their sizes .",
    "even if the meeting cells are thought of as sites where local discussions take place , galam s model @xcite does not incorporate local interactions since the individuals are randomly redistributed in the meeting cells at each time step of the dynamics .",
    "the alternative considered by schelling to the _ bounded neighborhood _ model is a _ spatial proximity _ model in which everybody defines his neighborhood by reference to his own spatial location .",
    "the spatial arrangement or configuration within the neighborhood mediates the interactions .",
    "we propose here a different neighborhood model which shares some characteristics with the _ bounded neighborhood _ and _ spatial proximity _ models : the meeting cells are neighborhoods defined by spatial location , therefore introducing important local effects , but the interaction within the neighborhood is independent of the spatial configuration within the cell .",
    "contrary to the model in @xcite the individuals are here located at fixed sites of a lattice . the local neighborhood or meeting cell in which a given individual interacts changes with time , reflecting neighborhoods of changing shape and size .",
    "such neighborhood model could be appropriate for a relatively primitive society in which interactions are predominantly among neighbors , but the size of the neighborhood or interaction range is not fixed .",
    "a different version of galam s model was introduced by stauffer @xcite . at variance with our neighborhood models in which individuals are fixed in the sites of a lattice and the meeting cells",
    "have a maximum size , stauffer considers the situation in which individuals freely diffuse in a lattice with only a fraction of sites being occupied .",
    "this diffusion process leads to the formation of  natural \" clusters which play the role of our meeting cells : it is within each one of these clusters in which the rule of majority opinion and bias towards minority in case of a tie are taken .",
    "stauffer finds in his model that the time to reach a consensus opinion grows logarithmically with system size @xmath0 .",
    "we also find this dependence in the original model of galam , while in our neighborhood models the consensus time takes much larger values and is compatible with a power law dependence . a related model , including the figure of the  contrarians \" ( that is , people that always oppose to the majority position ) , was later introduced by galam @xcite and also analyzed by stauffer @xcite .",
    "a main consequence of introducing the spatial effects considered in our neighborhood models is that the threshold found in @xcite disappears with system size , i.e. @xmath4 , so that in large systems the minority opinion always spreads and overcomes the initial majority for whatever initial proportion of the minority opinion .",
    "this is a consequence of the existence of a critical size for a local domain of minority supporters .",
    "domains of size larger than the critical one will expand and occupy the whole system . for large systems",
    "there is always a finite probability to have a domain of over - critical size in the initial condition .",
    "while in traditional statistical physics we are mostly concerned with the thermodynamic limit of large systems , these findings emphasize the important role of system size in the sociological context of models of interacting individual entities .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 reviews the original definition of galam s model @xcite and introduces our new local neighborhood models . in sect .",
    "3 we go beyond the mean field limit of refs.@xcite by discussing the system size dependence of the predictions of the original model",
    ". steady - state and dynamical properties of our neighborhood models are presented in sects . 4 and 5 .",
    "general conclusions are summarized in sect .",
    "the model considers a population of @xmath0 individuals who randomly gather in  meeting cells \" .",
    "a meeting cell is just defined by the number of individuals @xmath5 that can meet in the cell .",
    "let us define @xmath6 as the probability that a particular person is found in a cell of size @xmath5 .",
    "obviously , it is @xmath7 .",
    "the dynamics of the model is as follows : first the meeting cells are defined by giving each one a size according to the probability distribution @xmath8 , such that the sum of all the cell sizes equals the number of individuals @xmath0 , but otherwise their location or shape are not specified .",
    "these cells are not modified during the whole dynamical process .",
    "the persons have an initial binary ( against , @xmath9 , or in favor , @xmath10 ) opinion about a certain topic . the probability that a person shares the @xmath9 opinion at time @xmath11 is @xmath12 and an equivalent definition for @xmath13 .",
    "initially one sets @xmath14 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath12 can be thought of as the proportion of people supporting opinion @xmath9 at time @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath0 individuals are then distributed randomly among the different cells .",
    "the basic premise of the model is that all the people within a cell adopt the opinion of the majority of the cell .",
    "furthermore , in the case of a tie ( which can only occur if the cell size @xmath5 is an even number ) , one of the opinions , that we arbitrarily identify with the @xmath9 opinion , is adopted .",
    "once an opinion within the different cells has been taken , time increases by one , @xmath15 and the individuals rearrange by distributing themselves again randomly among the different cells .",
    "the main finding of this model is that an initially minority opinion , corresponding to @xmath16 can win in the long term .",
    "this is an effect of the tie rule that selects the @xmath9 opinion in case of a tie .",
    "it is possible to write down a recursion relation for the density of people that at time @xmath11 have the @xmath9 opinion as @xcite @xmath17}^m { k\\choose j } p_+(t)^j \\ , \\left[1-p_+(t)\\right]^{k - j},\\ ] ] simultaneously @xmath18}^m{k\\choose j } p_-(t)^j \\ , \\left[1-p_-(t)\\right]^{k - j},\\ ] ] the notation @xmath19 $ ] indicates the integer part of @xmath20 .",
    "this is a mean - field equation that neglects possible fluctuations .    for a wide range of distributions",

    "individuals are fixed at the sites of a regular lattice and they interact with other individuals in their spatial neighborhood . we have considered several cases :      the @xmath0 individuals are distributed at the sites of a linear lattice @xmath30 . once distributed , they never move again . initially they are assigned a probability @xmath31 of adopting the @xmath9 opinion , and @xmath32 the @xmath10 opinion .",
    "the dynamics starts by defining the meeting cells @xmath33 as the segments @xmath34 $ ] of length @xmath35 .",
    "the cell sizes @xmath36 are distributed according to a uniform distribution in the interval @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "the average cell size is hence @xmath38 and the average number of cells is @xmath39 .",
    "once the cells are defined , the dynamical rules of galam s model are applied synchronously to all the cells , time increases by one @xmath15 . in the next time step , new cells , uncorrelated to the previous ones are defined and the dynamical rules applied again .",
    "the process continues until there is a single common opinion in the whole system .",
    "the two - dimensional case is very similar to the 1d version explained above .",
    "the only difference is the way the meeting cells are defined in the two - dimensional lattice .",
    "an individual is now characterized by two indexes @xmath40 with @xmath41 , such that the total number of individuals is @xmath42 .",
    "we have considered two different definitions of the cells originated in two tessellations of the plane : ( a ) the _ regular _ tessellation and ( b ) the _ locally - grown _ tessellation . in the regular tessellation",
    ", we define segments in the @xmath43 and @xmath44 axis independently , such that the sizes are in both cases uniformly distributed between @xmath45 and @xmath27 in the same way that we did in the one - dimensional case .",
    "figure [ tes - fig]a plots a typical example . in the _ locally - grown tessellation _",
    "we first choose a site of the lattice and then define a rectangle around it whose sides are both uniformly distributed between @xmath45 and @xmath27 .",
    "the cell is defined then as the sites in the resulting rectangle excluding those sites that already were part of a previously defined cell .",
    "figure [ tes - fig]b shows a typical example .",

    "time then increases by one @xmath15 . in the next time step ,",
    "new cells are defined and the process continues until a consensus opinion is reached in the whole population .",
    "the 1d and 2d models have been also considered in the asynchronous update version . in this case , a lattice site is randomly chosen and a cell defined around it as a segment ( 1d ) of size @xmath46 or a rectangle ( 2d ) of size @xmath47 .",
    "it is only within this cell that the biased majority rule is applied .",
    "time increases by @xmath48 in 1d and by @xmath49 in 2d . then a new site is selected randomly and the process iterates until a consensus opinion is obtained .",
    "we present in this section an analysis of galam s original non - local model .",
    "our aim is to go beyond the mean - field approach of references @xcite by studying the system size dependence of the different magnitudes of interest .",
    "some of the results are based on numerical simulations of the model .",
    "we consider @xmath0 individuals that distribute themselves randomly in meeting cells whose size is _ uniformly distributed _ between @xmath45 and @xmath27 .",

    "notice also in this figure that some pairs of consecutive values of @xmath27 give almost the same value for @xmath60 .",
    "the reason is that , for odd values of @xmath27 , the rule that applies in case of a tie is used only up to the value @xmath61 ( which is even ) , so odd numbers give similar values of @xmath60 than the precedent even number .    since eq .",
    "( [ map : mas ] ) neglects possible system size fluctuations , eq .",

    "[ opnl]b shows that the asymptotic results of @xmath63 are achieved by means of the following scaling relation @xmath64 therefore , there is a region of size @xmath65 where there is a significant probability that the results differ from the infinite size limit .",
    "we now analyze the time @xmath66 it takes to reach the consensus opinion . strictly speaking , in the mean field approach the number of iterations needed for eq .",
    "( 1 ) to converge to the fixed point is infinity . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was adopted the criterion that the fixed point had been reached at the time @xmath66 such that @xmath67 differs from the fixed point in less that @xmath68 . in our simulations , and as in reference @xcite , it is natural to define the time @xmath66 as the finite number of steps needed to reach the consensus opinion .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ timenl ] the time @xmath66 as a function of the initial probability @xmath31 of the favored opinion .",
    "it can be seen that the time @xmath66 increases with increasing system size and takes its maximum value at the faith point .",
    "a closer analysis shown in figure [ slopes ] shows that , for all values of @xmath31 , the time needed to reach the consensus increases logarithmically with @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same logarithmic dependence was found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the model accounting for brownian diffusion .",
    "a simple argument can help to understand this logarithmic behavior .",
    "one can mimic the size dependence of the time @xmath66 by noticing that the definition used in the numerical simulations is equivalent to define @xmath66 as the value for which @xmath69 or @xmath70 , since @xmath71 is the minimum possible value for @xmath31 over @xmath72 .",
    "this can be now obtained by linearizing the evolution equation around any of the fixed points @xmath73 .",

    "this is the logarithmic behavior observed in the simulations .",
    "furthermore , the slope of the logarithmic law will depend on the fixed point at which the system tends .",
    "so , at one side of the critical point , the slope should be different than at the other .",
    "figure [ slopes ] shows the confirmation of this prediction , where it is seen that for high values of @xmath31 ( above the faith point ) the slope is quite different than for lower values . for @xmath83 ,",
    "the predicted values for @xmath82 are @xmath84 and @xmath85 for the fixed point at @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively .",
    "the corresponding slopes , @xmath86 , are @xmath87 and @xmath88 . as shown in the figure",
    ", these values agree well with the measured slopes .",
    "the only discrepancy is for @xmath89 for which the time needed to reach consensus must include as well the time needed to leave the fixed point @xmath60 .",
    "in this section we consider the steady state properties of our neighborhood models defined in sect .",
    "[ neigh - models ] .",
    "we will see that the introduction of spatial local effects leads to a very different behavior than for the non - local version of the previous section in which individuals were distributed randomly in fixed cells .    in our neighborhood versions , similarly to the original galam model , it turns out that a consensus opinion is always reached in a finite number of steps .",
    "we first consider the order parameter , @xmath53 , defined as the probability that the consensus opinion coincides with the favored one .",
    "figures [ op1d ] and [ op2d ] show that , both in the 1d and the 2d cases , the order parameter @xmath53 is an increasing function of the initial probability @xmath31 of adopting the favored opinion .",
    "it is possible to define , quite arbitrarily , the transition point @xmath60 as the one for which @xmath90 .",
    "however , @xmath60 depends upon the system size as a power law @xmath91 , hence for increasing @xmath0 the transition point tends to @xmath92 .",
    "in other words , the transition disappears in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath93 , and the favored opinion , in that limit , is always the selected one independently of the initial choice .",
    "more precisely , the data can be described by the scaling law @xmath94 the exponent @xmath95 depends on the dimension and on the maximum size @xmath27 of the domains . in fig .",
    "[ alpha ] we plot the @xmath27-dependence of @xmath95 in several 1d and 2d neighborhood models .",
    "notice that @xmath95 decreases for increasing @xmath27 and it depends on the system dimension , but it is basically independent of the local rules defined .",
    "alternatively , for fixed @xmath31 we can define a critical value @xmath96 such that a small population @xmath97 tends not to propagate the initially minority opinion .",
    "there are several differences between the evolution in the neighborhood and non - local models .",
    "we first analyze the time @xmath66 needed to reach the consensus . as in galam s original model , the data in figs .",
    "[ time1d ] and [ time2d ] for the 1d and 2d cases , respectively , show that for fixed @xmath0 , the time @xmath66 reaches a maximum at the critical point @xmath98 .",

    "we have revisited galam s model @xcite of minority opinion spreading and introduced related neighborhood models that incorporate spatial local effects in the interactions .",
    "these models share basic characteristics with the _ bounded neighborhood _ and _ spatial proximity _ models of schelling @xcite . in both cases",
    "we have considered in detail the role of system size in the properties of the system . for the original nonlocal version @xcite",
    ", we have found that the transition from initial minority final dominance to initial minority disappearance is smeared out in a region of size @xmath65 , while the time it takes to reach complete consensus increases as @xmath1 , as in stauffer s percolation model @xcite .    in our local neighborhood models , we have considered 1d and 2d lattices with regular and locally grown tessellations , both with synchronous and asynchronous updates .",
    "all these local versions behave qualitatively in the same way . the most important",
    "finding is that the threshold value for the initial minority concentration @xmath60 decreases as @xmath132 , such that the transition from initial minority spreading to majority dominance disappears in the thermodynamic limit @xmath62 .",
    "the neighborhood models are , in this sense , more efficient to spread an initially minority opinion . however , while a nonlocal model is very fast in spreading a rumor , the corresponding relaxation times to reach consensus in the neighborhood models are much larger since they turn out to increase with a power of the system size @xmath0 .",
    "we have also shown that the fact that @xmath133 is due to the existence of a critical size for a spatial domain of minority supporters . for large enough systems",
    "there is always an over - critical domain that spreads and occupies the whole system , with a characteristic average radius growing linearly with time .",
    "this critical size domain has some analogies with the critical nucleus of nucleation theory @xcite , but it has different characteristics . in classical nucleation",
    "the existence of a critical radius is due to the competition between surface tension and different bulk energy between the two possible homogeneous states .",
    "the concept of critical nucleus in this context is not meaningful for one - dimensional systems for which no surface tension exists .",
    "an over - critical droplet appears as a rare fluctuation in the bulk of a metastable state and it then grows deterministically .",
    "noisy perturbations in the growth dynamics are generally a second order effect . in our case over -",
    "critical domains appear in the random initial condition .",
    "the critical size is here an average concept resulting from the competition of the bias favoring the minority opinion in case of a tie ( analog of bulk energy difference ) and a stochastic dynamics that might lead to the disappearance of the minority domain , surface tension being a second order effect .",
    "critical size means here equal probability for the domain to spread or to collapse .",
    "the existence of this critical size clearly shows an important difference between typical statistical physics problems and _ sociophysical _ ones . in the former case , one",
    "is mostly concerned with the thermodynamic limit of large systems , while these findings emphasize the important role of system size in the latter case .    *",
