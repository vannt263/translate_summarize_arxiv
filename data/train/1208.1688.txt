    "local search is one of the most common approaches applied in practice to solve hard optimization problems .",
    "it is used as a subroutine in several kinds of heuristics , such as evolutionary algorithms and hybrid heuristics that combine local search and genetic algorithms .",
    "the history of employing local search in combinatorial optimization and operations research dates back to the 1950s with the first edge - exchange algorithms for the traveling salesperson  @xcite .    in general ,",
    "such algorithms start from a feasible solution and iteratively try to improve the current solution . local search algorithms , also known as neighborhood search algorithms , form a large class of improvement algorithms .",
    "to perform local search , a problem specific neighborhood distance function is defined on the solution space and a better solution is searched in the neighborhood of the current solution . in particular ,",
    "many local search algorithms are based on searching the _",
    "@xmath0-exchange neighborhood_. this is the set of solutions that can be obtained from the current solution by exchanging at most @xmath0 elements .",
    "most of the literature on local search is primarily devoted to experimental studies of different heuristics .",
    "the theoretical study of local search has developed mainly in four directions .",
    "the first direction is the study of performance guarantees of local search , i.e. , the quality of the solution  @xcite .",
    "the second direction of the theoretical work is on the asymptotic convergence of local search in probabilistic settings , such as simulated annealing  @xcite .",
    "the third direction concerns the time required to reach a local optimum .",
    "the fourth direction is concerned with so - called kernelization techniques @xcite for local search , and aims at providing the basis for putting our theoretical results to work in practice .    in a recent paper by @xcite  ( @xcite )",
    "another twist in the study of local search has been taken with the goal of answering the following natural question .",
    "is there a faster way of searching the @xmath0-exchange neighborhood than brute - force ?",
    "this question is important because the typical running time of a brute - force algorithm is @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is the input length .",
    "such a running time becomes a real obstacle in using @xmath0-exchange neighborhoods in practice even for very small values of @xmath0 . for many years",
    "most algorithms searching an improved solution in the @xmath0-exchange neighborhood had an @xmath2 running time , creating the impression that this can not be done significantly faster than brute - force search .",
    "but is there mathematical evidence for this common belief ? or is it possible for some problems to search @xmath0-exchange neighborhoods in time @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is a small constant , which can make local search much more powerful ?",
    "an appropriate tool to answer all these questions is _",
    "parameterized complexity_. in the parameterized complexity framework , for decision problems with input size @xmath1 , and a parameter @xmath0 , the goal is to design an algorithm with running time @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a function of @xmath0 alone .",
    "problems having such an algorithm are said to be _ fixed parameter tractable ( fpt)_. there is also a theory of hardness that allows us to identify parameterized problems that are not amenable to such algorithms .",
    "the hardness hierarchy is represented by @xmath7 $ ] for @xmath8 .",
    "the theory of parameterized complexity was developed by @xcite  ( @xcite ) . for recent developments ,",
    "see the book by @xcite  ( @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we consider two variants of the local search problem for the well - known vertex cover problem , that is , the _ strict _ and the _ permissive _ variant of local search  ( marx and schlotter 2011 ; krokhin and marx ) . in the strict variant",
    "the task is to either determine that there is no better solution in the @xmath0-exchange neighborhood , or to find a better solution in the @xmath0-exchange neighborhood . in the permissive variant , however , the task is to either determine that there is no better solution in the @xmath0-exchange neighborhood , or to find a better solution , which may or may not belong to the @xmath0-exchange neighborhood .",
    "thus , permissive local search does not require the improved solution to belong to the local neighborhood , but still requires that at least the local neighborhood has been searched before abandoning the search .",
    "it can therefore be seen as a natural relaxation of strict local search with the potential to make local search applicable to a wider range of problems or instances . indeed",
    ", we will present a class of instances for vertex cover where strict local search is @xmath9}$]-hard , but permissive loal search is fpt .",
    "in heuristic local search , there is an abundance of techniques , such as random restarts and large neighborhood search , to escape local minima and boost the performance of algorithms @xcite .",
    "permissive local search is a specific way to escape the strictness of local search , but allows a rigorous analysis and performance guarantees .",

    "several positive and negative results have been obtained in many areas of ai .",
    "for instance , the local search problem has already been investigated for a variant of the feedback edge set problem  @xcite , for the problem of finding a minimum weight assignment for a boolean constraint satisfaction instance  ( krokhin and marx ) , for the stable marriage problem with ties  @xcite , for combinatorial problems on graphs  @xcite , for feedback arc set problem on tournaments  @xcite , for the satisfiability problem  @xcite , and for bayesian network structure learning  @xcite .",

    "all our results for vertex cover also hold for the independent set problem , and for the clique problem on the complement graph classes .",
    "* we give the first compelling evidence that it is possible to enhance the tractability of local search problems if permissive local search is considered instead of strict local search .",
    "indeed , the permissive variant allows us to solve the local search problem for vertex cover for a significantly larger class of sparse graphs than strict local search .",
    "* we show that the strict local search vertex cover problem remains @xmath10$]-hard for special sparse instances , improving a result from  @xcite  ( @xcite ) . on the way to this result",

    "<S> local search is one of the fundamental approaches to combinatorial optimization and it is used throughout ai . </S>",
    "<S> several local search algorithms are based on searching the @xmath0-exchange neighborhood . </S>",
    "<S> this is the set of solutions that can be obtained from the current solution by exchanging at most @xmath0 elements . as a rule of thumb , the larger </S>",
    "<S> @xmath0 is , the better are the chances of finding an improved solution . </S>",
    "<S> however , for inputs of size @xmath1 , a nave brute - force search of the @xmath0-exchange neighborhood requires @xmath2 time , which is not practical even for very small values of @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> fellows et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( ijcai 2009 ) studied whether this brute - force search is avoidable and gave positive and negative answers for several combinatorial problems . </S>",
    "<S> they used the notion of local search in a strict sense . </S>",
    "<S> that is , an improved solution needs to be found in the @xmath0-exchange neighborhood even if a global optimum can be found efficiently .    </S>",
    "<S> in this paper we consider a natural relaxation of local search , called _ permissive _ local search ( marx and schlotter , iwpec 2009 ) and investigate whether it enhances the domain of tractable inputs . </S>",
    "<S> we exemplify this approach on a fundamental combinatorial problem , vertex cover . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , we show that for a class of inputs , finding an optimum is hard , strict local search is hard , but permissive local search is tractable .    </S>",
    "<S> we carry out this investigation in the framework of parameterized complexity . </S>"
