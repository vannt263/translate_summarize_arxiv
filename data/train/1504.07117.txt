    "such a theory , not completely formulated so far , would reasonably describe the structure of spacetime at the planck scale where both of the gravitational and quantum mechanical effects become important . despite the fact that there is no unique approach to quantum gravity , existence of a universal minimum measurable length , preferably of the order of the planck length @xmath3 , is a common feature of quantum gravity candidates such as string theory and loop quantum gravity @xcite .",
    "it is then widely believed that a non - gravitational theory which includes a universal minimal length scale would appear at the flat limit of quantum gravity .",

    "appearance of curved energy - momentum space is the direct consequence of the doubly special relativity theories @xcite and , interestingly , the snyder noncommutative spacetime could be also realized in this setup by a relevant gauge fixing process @xcite .",
    "apart from the details of the above mentioned phenomenological models as a flat limit for quantum gravity , all of them suggest the deformation to the density of states at the high energy regime which in turn leads to the nonuniform measure over the set of microstates .",
    "indeed , in these setups , the number of accessible microstates will be reduced at the high energy regime due to the existence of a minimal length as an ultraviolet cutoff for the system under consideration .",

    ", we explicitly showed that @xmath0 of the number of degrees of freedom will be frozen at the high temperature regime for the special case of the ideal gas which also confirms our pervious claim .",
    "this result suggests an effective dimensional reduction of the space from three to one dimension at the high temperature regime which is also a common feature in alternative approaches to quantum gravity proposal .",
    "also , our analysis shows that @xmath135 and @xmath128 for the specific heat and the equation of state parameter respectively which are the direct consequences of the effective dimensional reduction of the space at the planck scale .",
    "although the quantum gravity effects would become important only at the high temperature regime , considering the low temperature limit is useful to estimate the order of the magnitude of the quantum gravity corrections to the thermodynamical quantities . evidently , the first order corrections to the internal energy , specific heat , and entropy are of the order of @xmath132 , where @xmath136 is the planck scale thermal de broglie wavelength ( [ lambda - p ] ) and @xmath133 is the standard thermal de broglie wavelength .",
