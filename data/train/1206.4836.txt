    "<S> pbt requires that alice and bob share quantum entanglement and consists of the following steps . </S>",

    "<S> however , it is not trivial to complete this task with only one round of cc . </S>",
    "<S> it was vaidman @xcite who first showed how to implement this task using a recursive scheme based on standard teleportation , which consumes an amount of entanglement growing double exponentially with the number of qubits @xmath7 of the input state @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> however , we justify the restriction that @xmath0 must be localized to a single port by noting that the advantage of pbt as described here , at least for implementing a universal programmable quantum processor and inlc , is that , before receiving alice s message , bob can apply the desired quantum operation to the state at every port , after which , @xmath0 is transformed as desired . </S>",

    "<S> . first , we present a version of the no - cloning theorem , which allows us to show that the probabilities @xmath34 and states @xmath35 can not depend on @xmath0 , while the state @xmath36 must do , as the notation suggests . </S>",
    "<S> second , we use the no - signaling principle to show that the state @xmath37 of port @xmath38 before implementing pbt must be of the form @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are the states to which @xmath38 transforms into after outcomes @xmath42 and @xmath4 are obtained , respectively . since @xmath37 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 are reduced states of @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath36 , respectively , @xmath37 and @xmath40 do not depend on @xmath0 , while @xmath41 does . </S>",

    "<S> this protocol combines the superdense coding protocol @xcite and a modified pbt protocol in which alice holds every port except for @xmath38 , which is held by bob , but does not allow communication . </S>",
    "<S> we show that this protocol succeeds with probability @xmath48 for some probability @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> since there is not communication in such a protocol , the no - signaling principle implies that bob can not obtain any information about alice s message . </S>",
    "<S> this means that bob can only obtain the correct message with the probability of making a random guess : @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> , because this would imply that a modified protocol in which bob applies a permutation to the obtained message succeeds with a probability higher than @xmath51 , violating the no - signaling principle . ] thus , we have @xmath52 summing over @xmath53 and using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq:4 ] ) , we obtain that @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 . </S>",

    "<S> thus , we obtain the desired bound , @xmath63 we continue with the arguments of the proof .    </S>",

    "<S> the fact that the states @xmath77 do not depend on @xmath0 , together with the fact that alice knows the resource state @xmath80 , her unitary @xmath6 , her projective measurement , and its result @xmath2 , implies that alice knows the states @xmath77 . </S>",
