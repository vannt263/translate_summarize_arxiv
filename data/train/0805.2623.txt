    "while such radiative corrections can be large enough to satisfy the lep bounds , they also contribute to the quadratic term of the higgs potential , leading to the `` little hierarchy problem '' .",
    "the mssm also suffers from a @xmath8-problem in that its lone dimensionful susy - invariant parameter , @xmath8 , is phenomenologically required to be of order 100 gev , while its natural scale can in principle be much larger .",

    "extensions of this type have been studied extensively by espinosa and quiros @xcite@xcite , felix - beltran @xcite , setzer and spinner @xcite , and diaz - cruz et al .",
    "while this model does not solve the @xmath8-problem , it is an interesting alternative to the nmssm , as an economical extension of the mssm , because it can also achieve a mass of the lightest @xmath1-even higgs boson that is larger than @xmath2 at tree level .",
    "furthermore , compared to the mssm and the nmssm , we expect there to be more radiative corrections to the mass of the lightest @xmath1-even higgs boson due to the additional states in the triplet . to the extent that these triplet - induced radiative corrections are significant",
    ", we may further alleviate the little hierarchy problem .",
    "unfortunately , in both the nmssm and the tessm , the respective singlet - induced and triplet - induced radiative corrections are typically small when we demand perturbativity at the scale of grand unified theory ( gut ) near @xmath12 gev .",
    "this is because perturbativity at the gut scale imposes the bound @xmath13 at the weak scale , where @xmath14 is respectively the higgs - singlet - higgs and the higgs - triplet - higgs coupling in the superpotential of the nmssm and tessm . in both models , while the tree - level mass of the lightest @xmath1-even higgs boson can be as large as 100 gev , the @xmath15 radiative corrections are not large enough to lift the higgs mass over the lep bounds .",
    "on the other hand , in the tessm , when we have @xmath16 ( so that @xmath14 is comparable with the top yukawa coupling)at the weak scale , we find the tree - level mass of the lightest @xmath1-even higgs boson to be close to the lep bound and the @xmath15 radiative corrections alone can easily lift the higgs mass over the lep bound even with small susy - breaking in the triplet sector . as the small susy - breaking in the triplet sector",
    "translate into small fine - tuning , we can solve the little hierarchy problem at the expense of giving up perturbativity at the gut scale .    without demanding perturbativity at the gut scale",
    ", we also expect the nmssm to be a solution to the little hierarchy problem , with the mass of the lightest @xmath1-even higgs boson that satisfies the lep bounds without significant contribution from the top  s - top sector . however , as an alternative to the nmssm and a reasonably economical extension of the mssm , the tessm and its phenomenology are interesting in their own right .",
    "for example , as we show in this paper , the mssm limit of the tessm is achieved with @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the susy - invariant mass of the triplet , keeping @xmath14 fixed , whereas in the nmssm one requires @xmath19 to achieve the mssm limit . as another example , even though the sub - tev , electrically - neutral component of the triplet acquires a vev , we can still satisfy the precision electroweak constraints without the extreme fine - tuning noted in the triplet - extended sm @xcite .",
    "moreover , there may be other considerations that motivate extending the mssm by a triplet instead of a singlet .",
    "for example , in obtaining neutrino masses through the type - ii @xcite and type - iii seesaw mechanisms , the sm is commonly extended with higgs triplets . though the higgs triplets may have nonzero hypercharge , hypercharge - neutral triplets are often present when the models are supersymmetrized and embedded in a unified gauge group @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "we organize our paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : tessm ] , we lay out the superpotential and the lagrangian of the tessm , compare it to the nmssm , and discuss constraints on its parameter space from electroweak precision tests and the requirement of perturbativity at the gut scale . in sec .",

    "we also discuss the gluon - gluon fusion production and diphoton decay of the lightest , @xmath1-even higgs boson in sec .",
    "[ sec : higgsmass ] .",
    "our discussions of the gluon - gluon fusion production rely only on the existence of light s - tops and the minimal color sector of the mssm , and are therefore applicable to any extensions of the mssm that solves the little hierarchy problem without invoking additional colored states . in sec .",
    "[ sec : finetuning ] , we estimate two sources of fine - tuning in this model , and find that we can achieve a small fine - tuning of about one part in 30 in the higgs sector . finally , we conclude with sec .  [",

    "we extend the mssm with a hypercharge - neutral , @xmath10-triplet @xmath20 with the superpotential @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the higgs doublets of the mssm , @xmath23 is a lagrange - multiplier determined from the potential , and @xmath24 is the mssm superpotential sans the @xmath8-term @xmath25 note that , since @xmath11 is a chiral superfield , its scalar component necessarily contains a _ complex _ @xmath10-triplet , whereas in non - susy extensions of the sm @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite , we can extend the sm with a real @xmath10-triplet . in components",

[ eq : model ] gives us a coefficient of unity for the term @xmath28 as with the case of the nmssm when @xmath29 is replaced by a singlet @xmath9 , and facilitates direct comparisons between tessm and nmssm .",
    "we can achieve gauge coupling unification at @xmath30 by including additional chiral superfields with quantum numbers @xmath31 where the first and second entries inside the parenthesis denote , respectively , the representations under the color @xmath32 and weak @xmath33 gauge groups , and the subscripts denote the charge under hypercharge @xmath34 gauge group .",
    "this added content can have both susy - invariant and susy - breaking masses sufficiently large ( say 2 tev s ) so that they decouple from the electroweak scale physics , while still allowing for gauge coupling unification .",
    "the added matter content ( triplet plus those in eq .",
    "[ eq : addedx ] ) does not constitute a complete multiplet of su(5 ) , but can form a complete multiplet of trinification group @xmath35 @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "in addition to the mssm soft susy - breaking parameters , we also have soft terms involving @xmath11 @xmath36        for simplicity , we assume that all couplings and masses in the superpotential are real . the tree - level potential involving the @xmath37-neutral higgs doublets and triplet is then @xmath38 where @xmath39    compared with the higgs potential in the mssm , we have an enhancement in the quartic coupling of the form @xmath40 and this in principle allows for a tree - level mass eigenvalue larger than @xmath2 after electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "this is similar to the case in the nmssm , where such quartic couplings are also generated from a superpotential of the form @xmath41 as with the nmssm , where the requirement of perturbativity at the gut scale limits @xmath13 at the tev - scale , the tessm also has a bound @xmath42 at the tev - scale while still preserving perturbativity at the gut scale .",
    "though the bounds are similar , the details of obtaining such bounds are different and may be important for further model - building where perturbativity at the gut scale is imposed .",
    "we elaborate briefly on some key differences between the two models from the relevant renormalization group equations ( rges ) given by @xmath43 and note the following points :    * in the nmssm , there are two possible landau poles in @xmath14 and @xmath44 .",
    "the rge of @xmath44 is such that @xmath44 always increases when evolving to higher energies , and @xmath44 feeds into the evolution of @xmath14 . in the tessm",
    ", there is no such contribution because tr@xmath45 , but there are now additional contributions to the @xmath46 coefficient in @xmath47 in the tessm . * in the tessm , @xmath47 has a larger coefficient for the negative contribution of the form @xmath48 because @xmath11 is charged under @xmath10 . as the coupling @xmath49 is non - asymptotically - free in the tessm ( also in the nmssm ) , this gives a stronger suppression at higher energies and could potentially delay the appearance of the @xmath14 landau pole .",
    "* the coupling @xmath49 also flows to larger values in the tessm than in the nmssm because of the added matter content .",
    "this again gives a suppression at higher energies and may delay the @xmath14 landau pole .",
    "( this can be achieved in the nmssm with added matter content , for example , in the nmssm with gauge - mediated susy - breaking . )",
    "thorough studies on the upper bounds of @xmath14 in tessm and its extensions would require examining fixed points from the rges , and we leave these investigations for the future . for our work , it suffices to note that perturbativity at the gut scale imposes @xmath42 at the weak scale , so that @xmath14 is of similar strength to the weak gauge coupling . as such ,",
    "while the tree - level mass of the lightest @xmath1-even higgs boson can be 100 gev ( as we later show ) , we expect the @xmath15 radiative corrections to the mass of the lightest @xmath1-even higgs boson to be insufficient to lift the higgs mass above the lep bounds .",
    "however , motivated by solving the hierarchy problem , we take the view point that the landau pole we encounter at a higher scale ( around @xmath50 gev ) is rescued by some other new physics and analyze the higgs spectra and the phenomenology for larger values of @xmath14 .",
    "we take values of @xmath14 comparable to the top yukawa coupling , so that the tev scale physics is still perturbative . as @xmath14 is now near unity at the tev - scale in the tessm and",
    "we expect there to be more @xmath15 radiative corrections to the mass of the lightest @xmath1-even higgs boson compared to the nmssm , it is worthwhile to investigate these radiative corrections in detail .    in extensions of the nmssm , such as fat higgs models @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite",
