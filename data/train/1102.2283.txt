    "the main objective of this article is to understand the role of space , taking the form of local but also stochastic interactions , in the long - term behavior of ecological communities .",
    "this is carried out through the comparison of analytical and numerical results for an interacting particle system and its nonspatial mean - field approximation .",
    "both the spatial and nonspatial models mimic the dynamics of communities in which each species produces a certain type of resource and has varying abilities to exploit the resources produced by its own species and by the other species .",
    "as explained later in this paper after the rigorous mathematical description of the interacting particle system and its mean - field approximation , this framework can be used to model a wide variety of biological interactions such as competition , mutualism , allelopathy , or predation . in the interacting particle system ,",
    "individuals are located on an infinite grid and only have access to the resources produced by their nearest neighbors .",
    "in contrast , the mean - field approximation assumes that all individuals interact globally therefore the dynamics only depend on the overall densities of species , which results in a nonspatial deterministic model that consists of a system of coupled differential equations .",
    "the reason for this comparative study is mainly motivated by the following key question raised in the seminal article of durrett and levin @xcite about the importance of space : which details should be included in a mathematical model and which ones can be ignored ?",
    "the simplest approach in modeling the evolution of inherently spatial interacting populations is to assume that the system is homogeneously mixing and to use a system of ordinary differential equations , which is a common approach in the life science literature . at the other extreme",
    ", one can use the framework of interacting particle systems in which individuals are discrete and space is treated explicitly . for a wide range of parameter values ,",
    "we show that both approaches result in different predictions as for the sets of species that survive or coexist in the long run .",
    "this indicates that , at least for the type of interactions considered in this article , the use of the mean - field approach to model the evolution of communities in which individuals are static and interact only locally is invalid . in other words ,",
    "local interactions can not be ignored and should be included in the model .    using the terminology of game theory , a species that has a higher ability ,",
    "respectively a lower ability , than all other species to exploit the resources it produces can be seen as a defector , respectively a cooperator . in the presence of only two species , the spatial and nonspatial models strongly disagree when both species are defectors or both species are cooperators . in particular , while mutual cooperation always leads to coexistence in the mean - field model , the inclusion of local interactions translates into a reduction of the coexistence region .",
    "past research has revealed that the inclusion of space can indeed prevent coexistence .",
    "this has been proved analytically for a spatially explicit version of the lotka - volterra model introduced in @xcite and the non mendelian diploid model introduced in @xcite .",
    "these two references and the companion paper @xcite , which provides rigorous proofs of the analytical results stated in this article for the interacting particle system , focus on spatial and nonspatial models with only two types .",
    "our approach is somewhat different .",
    "first , one of our main objectives is to give more explicit intuitive explanations of the reason why the inclusion of local interactions can affect drastically the long - term behavior of ecological communities . in particular",
    ", heuristic arguments are provided to this extent .",
    "second , the emphasis here is on the three - type models .",
    "not only the analysis of the models in the presence of three species is somewhat more challenging but also , and more importantly , both the spatial and the nonspatial three - type models exhibit new interesting behaviors that can not be observed when only two species are involved .",
    "for instance , whereas cooperation is the only mechanism that promotes coexistence in the presence of two species , we prove that there are other such mechanisms when additional species are introduced .",
    "interestingly , our analysis also indicates that the inclusion of local interactions has antagonistic effects on coexistence depending on the mechanism involved , promoting coexistence in some situations but preventing coexistence in other situations .",
    "in particular , we believe that the three - type spatial and nonspatial models can capture most of the important aspects of communities involving a large number of species , whereas the two - type models do not .",
    "in order to understand the role of local interactions ( and stochasticity ) in the dynamics of ecological communities including varying abilities to exploit resources , we introduce and investigate a stochastic spatial model and its deterministic nonspatial analog , and then confront the predictions based on both models .",
    "the first model is an example of interacting particle system while the second one is its mean - field approximation which consists of a system of differential equations . for a description of the theoretical framework of interacting particle systems along with biological motivations ,",
    "we refer the reader to durrett and levin @xcite and neuhauser @xcite . for the sake of concreteness , we think of both models as describing the dynamics of ecological communities with @xmath0 species that we label from species 1 to species @xmath0 , but we point out that these models can also be seen as more general models in game theory with potential applications in population genetics , economics , or political sciences . in the ecological context ,",
    "the individuals of species @xmath1 has to be thought of as producing a resource that we simply call resource @xmath1 .",
    "the interactions , either local in the spatial model or global in the nonspatial one , are dictated by the @xmath2 matrix @xmath3 where coefficient @xmath4 represents the ability of an individual of species @xmath5 to exploit resource @xmath1 .",
    "it is assumed that matrix @xmath6 has only nonnegative entries and , to avoid degenerated cases later , that each column of the matrix has at least one positive entry .",
    "we note that each row can be seen as the abilities of a given species to exploit each of the @xmath0 resources , and each column as the abilities of each of the @xmath0 species to exploit a given resource .",
    "in particular , the assumption that each column of the matrix has at least one positive entry means from an ecological point of view that each of the resources can be exploited by at least one species . since different species have _ a priori _ different abilities to exploit each of the resources , their fitness strongly depends upon the configuration of their environment as well . therefore , there is a constant feedback between the set of fitnesses and the configuration of the environment , which creates nontrivial dynamics .      following the traditional framework of interacting particle systems",
    ", we assume that space is discrete and time is continuous .",
    "more precisely , the spatial structure is represented by the @xmath7-dimensional integer lattice , @xmath8 , while the temporal structure is represented by the variable @xmath9 which is any nonnegative real number .",
    "each lattice site has to be thought of as a spatial location which , at any time , is occupied by an individual of one of the @xmath0 species .",
    "this corresponds to a high - density limit in which , at death , an individual is instantaneously replaced by the offspring of a nearby individual .",
    "hence , the spatial configuration of the system at time @xmath9 is represented by a function @xmath10 that maps the integer lattice into the set of species , with @xmath11 indicating the species of the individual at site @xmath12 at time @xmath9 .    to describe the dynamics of the spatial model but also to derive its mean - field approximation ,",
    "it is convenient to think of the spatial structure as a graph . in the spatial model ,",
    "each lattice site is connected by an edge to each of its @xmath13 nearest neighbors , therefore , writing @xmath14 to indicate that sites @xmath12 and @xmath15 are nearest neighbors , the integer @xmath16 denotes the number of type @xmath5 neighbors of site @xmath12 .",
    "the species at each site is updated at the arrival times of a poisson process with intensity 1 , that is the times between consecutive updates at a given site are independent and exponentially distributed random variables with parameter 1 .",
    "the dynamics are dictated by stochastic and local interactions , meaning that the new type at each update is chosen randomly from the neighborhood , in order to model the inclusion of an explicit space .",
    "more precisely , given that the species at site @xmath12 is of type @xmath1 at the time of an update , the new species at this site is chosen to be species @xmath5 with probability @xmath17 and we assume , in the event that the denominator is equal to zero , that the update is canceled so the species at site @xmath12 remains unchanged .",
    "this probability can be interpreted as follows .",
    "since the coefficient @xmath4 represents the ability of an individual of species @xmath5 to exploit resource @xmath1 , the numerator is simply the overall ability of the type @xmath5 neighbors to exploit the resource at site @xmath12 at the time of the update .",
    "similarly , the denominator represents the overall ability of all the neighbors to exploit the resource at site @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the probability in is the relative ability of the type @xmath5 neighbors to exploit the resource at site @xmath12 , which we also naturally consider as the probability of the new species at site @xmath12 to be species @xmath5 .",
    "hence , the new species at each update is chosen randomly from the local neighborhood with a selective advantage for neighbors that have a higher ability to exploit the resource present at the site to be updated . finally , we point out that , because there are countably many lattice sites , updates at different sites can not occur simultaneously , so the new type can indeed be chosen from the local neighborhood without ambiguity .",
    "the mean - field model is naturally derived from the original interacting particle system by excluding both space and stochasticity .",
    "for a discussion about the connections between interacting particle systems and their mean - field approximations , we refer the reader to durrett and levin @xcite . to motivate the definition of the mean - field model , we first replace the infinite lattice by a finite complete graph , that is a finite graph in which each site is connected to all other sites including itself , so that all sites have the same neighborhood that consists of all the vertex set . describing the interactions as previously but using this universal neighborhood rather than local neighborhoods results in a nonspatial environment in which the types at different sites are independent and identically distributed random variables .",
    "in particular , @xmath18 where @xmath12 is a denominated site , are probabilities that indeed no longer depend on @xmath12 .",
    "the mean - field approximation is then defined as the deterministic system of coupled ordinary differential equations that describes the evolution of these probabilities . to derive this deterministic system from the stochastic dynamics ,",
    "we first observe that @xmath19 moreover , the probability that , at the next update , a type @xmath1 is replaced by a type @xmath5 is also the probability @xmath20 that the site chosen to be updated is of type @xmath1 times the probability that the new type selected is type @xmath5 . since in addition sites are independent and",
    "the probability of an update at site @xmath12 in a very short time interval is roughly equal to the length of this interval , we obtain @xmath21 for @xmath22 small . substituting in , dividing by @xmath23 , and taking the limit as @xmath24 , we get @xmath25 for all @xmath26 .",
    "each fraction in the first sum of is the relative ability of species @xmath5 to exploit resource @xmath1 over all the community which , when different species have different abilities to exploit each of the resources , strongly depends on the species distribution .",
    "therefore , the first sum can be seen as the overall birth rate of individuals of species @xmath5 .",
    "note also that the second sum is simply equal to @xmath27 , so the mean - field approximation reduces to the system @xmath28 the minus one term indicates that the per capita death rate of each species is equal to 1 , which results from the fact that , in the original stochastic process , each lattice site is updated at the arrival times of a poisson process with intensity 1 .      even though , following the traditional terminology , the mean - field model is called _ nonspatial _ deterministic approximation , both models , in fact , include space , but at different levels of details . in the interacting particle system ,",
    "the state space consists of spatial configurations of species on the lattice that can only interact with their nearest neighbors therefore space takes the form of local interactions , which is referred to as _ explicit space_. the mean - field model is obtained by replacing the lattice by a complete graph , in particular space is again included but it now takes the form of global interactions , which is referred to as _",
    "implicit space_. the interacting particle system describes more suitably populations in which individuals are static and can only disperse their offspring over short distances , whereas the mean - field model is more appropriate to mimic populations in which individuals either move or have the ability to disperse their offspring over very long distances .",
    "most mathematical models introduced in the life science literature that describe spatially explicit interacting populations consist however of systems of ordinary differential equations that assume that populations are well - mixed .",
    "the objective of this study is to prove both analytically and numerically that , at least for the type of interactions considered in this article , the use of the mean - field approach is invalid for a wide range of parameters in the sense that both models result in different predictions . before stating our results ,",
    "it is necessary to specify what is meant here by : both models result in different predictions . in the interacting particle system ,",
    "since the types at different lattice sites are not independent , some quantities of interest are the so - called spatial correlations , the correlations between the types at two sites as a function of the distance between these two sites .",
    "there is obviously no analog of these quantities in the mean - field model since it does not include any geometrical structure . also , the traditional approach to compare both models is to compare the density of a given species in the mean - field model with the probability of a denominated site being occupied by this species type in the interacting particle system : whenever one of these two quantities converges to zero whereas the other one is bounded away from zero uniformly in time , we say that both models result in different predictions . in other words ,",
    "both models are said to result in different predictions for a given set of parameters whenever the set of species surviving in the long run differ between both models .",
    "the limiting behavior of both the interacting particle system and its mean - field approximation depends upon two factors : the initial distribution of species , which is a spatial configuration on the lattice for the first model and an @xmath0-tuple of densities that sums up to one for the second model , and more importantly the matrix @xmath6 that describes the type of biological interactions among species .",
    "these different types of biological interactions are modeled by the relationships among the matrix coefficients , which can be conveniently described by using the terminology of game theory .",
    "also , we say that a species is a _",
    ", respectively a _ defector _ , if it has a lower ability , respectively a better ability , than all other species to exploit the resource it produces .",
    "that is , in the column corresponding to the resource produced by this species , the smallest , respectively the largest , coefficient is the coefficient on the diagonal .",
    "while a species can be neither a cooperator nor a defector in communities with more than two species , each species is either a cooperator or a defector in its relationship with a second species , which induces three types of interactions for each pair of species : we call _ cooperation _ the interaction between two cooperators , _ competition _ the interaction between two defectors , and _ cheating _ relationship the interaction between a cooperator and a defector in which case the defector is called a _",
    "cheater_. to understand the variety of biological interactions that can be encoded by the parameter matrix , it is important to point out that , even if the individuals of a certain species do not strictly speaking produce resources that are beneficial for their species or the other species , their death produces nevertheless a resource available to their neighbors : space .",
    "in particular , the matrix coefficient @xmath4 can represent more generally the ability of species @xmath5 to exploit space with whatever an individual of species @xmath1 produces : space with resources that are beneficial for the nearby individuals such as nutrients , or at the opposite space with biochemicals that have a harmful effect on the growth of other species and reduce their ability to exploit the spatial location available in the context of allelopathic interactions .    focusing on interactions involving only two species ,",
    "when none of the species is a producer , the interactions are described by the matrix in which both columns are equal . this models competition for space with the common coefficient in each row representing the ability of the corresponding species to invade space .",
    "the species with the better ability to exploit space is a defector while the other species is a cooperator .",
    "competition for space is common in plant communities , but also occurs among territorial animals such as the grey wolf , _ canis lupus _ , although in this case this is more symptomatic of a defensive behavior . in the former context",
    ", interactions among plants that spread nearby through their rhizome such as _ euphorbia _ are better captured by the interacting particle system while the mean - field model describes more suitably the interactions among seed plants that can disperse over large distances through anemochory , zoochory or hydrochory such as the dandelion , _",
    "taraxacum officinale_. when both species indeed produce resources and these resources are more beneficial for the other species , a symbiotic relationship called mutualism , both species are cooperators : the coefficients off diagonal are larger than the coefficients on the diagonal .",
    "mutualism is common for instance in terrestrial plants which live in association with mycorrhizal fungi , with the plant providing carbon to the fungus and the fungus providing nutrients to the plant . as mentioned above ,",
    "our models are also suited to mimic allelopathic interactions in which a so - called allelopathic species produces biochemicals that have detrimental effects on the growth and reproduction of other organisms . in this case and",
    "when the other species is indeed susceptible to the allelochemicals , the allelopathic species is a defector since it has a better ability to invade a spatial location saturated with allelochemicals , while the susceptible species can be either a defector or a cooperator depending on its relative ability to invade spatial locations void of allelochemicals .",
    "allelopathic interactions are common among invasive plants such as the spotted knapweed , _ centaurea maculosa _ , that uses biochemicals as a defense against other plants and herbivory . in predator - prey systems , the resource that the predator exploits",
    "is not produced by the prey , it is the prey itself , therefore one needs to slightly reinterpret the microscopic rules of the models : a spatial location is not invaded by a nearby predator just after the prey dies but just before , with the death of the prey being caused by the predator . in this context , the prey is always a cooperator , while the predator is either a defector or a cooperator depending on its relative ability to invade empty spatial locations .",
    "note however that our models do not reproduce the oscillations typical of certain predator - prey systems such as the one designed in the popular huffaker s mite experiment @xcite since it assumes that the predator can survive in the absence of the prey . a similar choice of parameters can also be used to model some cases of facultative parasitism in which the parasite can complete its life cycle without being associated with the host , provided one identifies the infected host with the parasite itself , which is only valid in contexts where infected hosts are sterile .",
    "the analysis of the mean - field model in this article and the analysis of the interacting particle system in the companion paper @xcite give a precise picture of the asymptotic properties of systems involving only two species , which includes all the biological interactions mentioned in this paragraph .",
    "for larger ecological communities involving @xmath0 species , the appropriate relationships among the matrix coefficients can be deduced by looking at the type of biological interactions that relates any two species . in this case",
    ", the analysis of the mean - field model pays a particular attention to coexistence and gives sharp results for communities that exhibit rock - paper - scissors dynamics in which three species together may coexist whereas , in the absence of any of these three species , the other two species can not : paper covers rock , scissors cut paper and rock smashes scissors .",
    "such dynamics have been observed in the common side - blotched lizard , _ uta stansburiana _ , that exhibits color polymorphisms @xcite . rather than including three different species ,",
    "the system consists of male individuals of the common side - blotched lizard with three different phenotypes : orange - throated males , yellow stripe throated males , and blue - throated males , corresponding to three different mating strategies .",
    "while evolutionary theory predicts selection of the best fit , all three phenotypes coexist in nature which , according to the model of sinervo and lively @xcite , is due to the fact that the three phenotypes interact like in the rock - paper - scissors game .",
    "our numerical and anaytical results give a valuable insight into this type of dynamics .",
    "in this section , we collect a number of analytical results for the mean - field model . we start with general lemmas that will be applied repeatedly afterwards to understand the limiting behavior of the system with two and three species , respectively .",
    "the first step is to identify the positive invariant sets of the mean - field model . for @xmath29 , @xmath30 ,",
    "we let @xmath31 and simply write @xmath32 and @xmath33 when @xmath34 . from the fact that @xmath27 can be interpreted as a probability , it should be intuitively clear that the set @xmath35 is positive invariant for the mean - field model .",
    "also , since individuals of either type can not appear spontaneously in the interacting particle system , the same holds in the mean - field model , so each set @xmath36 should be positive invariant .",

    "the intuition behind this result is that the fitness of species @xmath5 , which is a function of the configuration of species , is always strictly larger than the fitness of species @xmath1 _ regardless _ of the configuration of the system .",

    "recall that in the presence of @xmath56 species , there are only three possible types of interactions : cooperation , competition , and cheating .",
    "interestingly , the nonspatial model also exhibits exactly three types of long - term behaviors which are directly connected to the type of relationship between the species .",
    "more precisely , we have the following results : cheating implies victory of the cheater , competition implies bistability , and cooperation implies coexistence . to prove these results",

    "we note that , excluding the case @xmath225 in which the process is static , the set of interfaces , defined as the random set of points in the dual lattice @xmath226 that lie between two different types , evolves almost like a system of independent annihilating symmetric random walks .",
    "more precisely , each interface jumps one unit to the left or one unit to the right with equal probability except when two interfaces are distance one apart .",
    "moreover , when an interface jumps to another interface , both interfaces annihilate .",
    "using that symmetric random walks are recurrent in one dimension , it is straightforward to conclude that the set of interfaces goes extinct .",
    "this translates into a clustering of the process , which is defined as the fact that the probability that two lattice sites have different types tends to 0 as time goes to infinity , i.e. , @xmath227 the behavior of the one - dimensional process can thus be summarized as follows .",

    "we refer the reader to @xcite , section 2 , for a rigorous proof of these two statements .",
    "in contrast with the predictions based on the mean - field approximation , theorem [ th : spatial-1d ] indicates that , except in the trivial case when the process is static , coexistence is never possible in one dimension even when both species cooperate strongly by providing resources that increase the fitness of the other species .",

    "this indicates that the type at each site alternates infinitely often , thus giving the impression of coexistence . however , coexistence is not , strictly speaking , possible in the sense that there is no equilibrium in which both types are present : except in the static case , there are only two stationary distributions , namely the ones that correspond to the configurations in which all sites are of type 1 or all sites are of type 2 .",

    "this result is expected since in this case species 2 is a cheater : it has a higher ability than species 1 to exploit resources of either type . since this holds for arbitrarily small parameter @xmath118 and the probability that species 2 outcompetes species 1 is nonincreasing with respect to @xmath93 and nondecreasing with respect to @xmath94 , we obtain the following result .

    "this process is known as the threshold voter model for which liggett @xcite has proved that coexistence occurs in any dimension @xmath231 .",

    ", there is again a duality relationship between the process and a certain system of random walks whose analysis reveals that type 2 wins .",
    "moreover , the techniques of the proof allow for the application of a perturbation argument , so the same conclusion holds in a certain topological neighborhood of the matrix @xmath242 which induces the existence of a parameter region for which coexistence occurs for the mean - field model but not the spatial model .",
    "[ th : spatial - reduction ] there is @xmath118",
    "such that type 2 wins whenever @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "the proof of this theorem can be found in @xcite , section 6 .",
    "this result indicates that even though two species cooperate , they can not coexist in space if their relationship has too much asymmetry , that is when one species cooperates much more than the other .",
    "in such situation , the dominant species is again the least cooperative one .",
    "in order to understand the role of local interactions ( and stochasticity ) , we confront the analytical results obtained for the nonspatial and spatial models as well as additional numerical results provided in this section for the spatial model .",
    "since numerical simulations of stochastic spatial models are somewhat difficult to interpret , we start by devoting few lines to mention important theoretical results that justify the approach we have followed to draw general conclusions from particular simulation results .",
    "numerical and analytical results are used to first obtain a complete picture of the differences between both models when only two species are present .",
    "we note however that a complete understanding of the stochastic three - type model based on simulations is out of reach due to a too large number of parameters .",
    "our approach is to use the results obtained for the nonspatial model and the spatial two - type model as a guide to find certain three - dimensional submanifolds of the set of parameters along which interesting behaviors emerge .",
    "numerical simulations along these manifolds are then performed in order to obtain three - dimensional phase diagrams of the models when the set of parameters is restricted to particular subsets .      in the numerical simulations of the spatial model ,",
    "the population evolves on a @xmath245 lattice with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "that is , sites on the bottom row are neighbors of those on the top row , while sites on the left edge are neighbors of those on the right edge .",
    "in addition , the process starts from a uniform product measure , meaning that the types at different sites are initially independent and of either type with probability @xmath246 where @xmath0 denotes the total number of species , so sites are equally likely to be of either type .",
    "the process always halts after exactly @xmath247 updates which corresponds to approximately 2000 units of time , which is simply obtained by dividing the number of updates by the number of sites and using the fact that each site is updated in average once per unit of time .",
    "the first difficulty in interpreting correctly these spatial simulations is that the stochastic process on a finite connected graph always converges to a configuration in which all sites have the same type , therefore coexistence is not possible on a @xmath245 lattice , whereas our analytical results show that two types can coexist on the infinite lattice .",
    "however , rigorous research in the topic of interacting particle systems indicates that , in the presence of a dominant type , this type typically invades space linearly in all the directions .",
    "in contrast , analytical results notably about the voter model on the torus @xcite show that , in the absence of a dominant type , the time to fixation of the process on large but finite graphs is sufficiently large that numerical simulations indeed reflect a transient behavior of the finite system that is symptomatic of the long - term behavior of its infinite analog . in particular , it is accurate to define a dominant type as a type which is able to invade our finite lattice in less than 2000 units of time while starting from a low density .",
    "the second difficulty is that the absence of a dominant type as defined above , namely the simultaneous survival of at least two types up to time 2000 , is not always symptomatic of coexistence for the infinite analog .",
    "the reason is that , as proved in @xcite for the voter model , in case the infinite system clusters , the time to fixation of its finite analog is excessively large , which gives the impression of coexistence , whereas different types can not coexist at equilibrium even for the infinite system .",
    "however , spatial correlations emerge quickly enough so that properties of the configuration of the finite system at time 2000 allow to speculate about the infinite system . more precisely , in the absence of a dominant type",
    ", the dichotomy between clustering and coexistence will be based on a quantity that we shall call _ clustering coefficient _ and that we define as the percentage of edges that connect sites of the same type .",
    "note that the clustering coefficient also gives a good approximation of the probability that two nearest neighbors are of the same type . to distinguish between clustering and coexistence",
    ", we invoke a result proved in @xcite about the diffusive clustering of the two - dimensional voter model , which roughly indicates that the clustering of the process is extremely slow and motivates the use of the voter model as a test model .",
    "numerical simulations of the voter model , which is obtained from our general model by choosing a matrix in which all the coefficients are equal , give the values 86% and 81% for the clustering coefficient of the two - type voter model and three - type voter model , respectively , at time 2000 .",
    "therefore , in the absence of a dominant type , we will assume that the infinite system clusters if the clustering coefficient of its finite analog is larger or equal to 86% in the presence of two types and larger or equal to 81% in the presence of three types , and that the process coexists otherwise . in conclusion ,",
    "the long - term behavior of the infinite system is related to the clustering coefficient of its finite analog as follows :    1 .",
    "_ coexistence _ occurs when the clustering coefficient of the finite system is smaller than that of the corresponding voter model , that is either 86% or 81% , 2 .",
    "_ clustering _ occurs when the clustering coefficient of the finite system is simultaneously larger than that of the corresponding voter model and different from 100% , 3 .",
    "existence of a _ dominant type _ occurs when the clustering coefficient is equal to 100% ,    and we again point out that past research in the field of interacting particle systems allows to speculate with some confidence about the long - term behavior of the infinite system based on numerical simulations and the previous classification .      in the presence of two species ,",
    "the dynamics only depends on two parameters , namely , the relative abilities @xmath93 and @xmath94 of species 1 and 2 , respectively , to exploit resources of their type .",
    "therefore , the long term - behavior of the spatial and nonspatial models can be simply summarized in a two - dimensional phase diagram .",
    "the phase diagrams of the spatial and nonspatial models are depicted on the left - hand side and right - hand of figure [ fig : two - type ] .",
    "the phase diagram of the nonspatial model is completely understood analytically whereas the one of the spatial model is obtained from a combination of analytical and numerical results .",
    "labels on the parameter regions surrounded with dashed lines refer to the theorems of section [ sec : stochastic ] . in both diagrams ,",
    "the different phases are delineated with thick continuous lines , and we distinguish three cases .",
    "_ presence of a cheater . _ in defector - cooperator relationships , in which case we call the defector a cheater , analytical results for both the spatial and the nonspatial models indicate that the cheater outcompetes the other species ( see theorems [ th : global-2 ] and [ th : spatial - invasion ] ) .",
    "the intuition behind this result is that , since the cheater has a better ability to exploit resources of either type , its fitness is always higher than the fitness of the other species _ regardless _ of the configuration of species .",

    "the parameters being fixed , provided the initial density of either species exceeds some critical threshold , this species outcompetes the other species .",
    "in contrast , analytical results for the spatial model ( see theorem [ th : spatial - pure - birth ] ) reveal the existence of parameter regions in which there is a dominant type that outcompetes the other species regardless of the initial configuration provided it starts with a positive density .",
    "numerical results for the spatial model further indicate that when @xmath229 there is a dominant type which is uniquely determined by the parameters of the system : the dominant type is always the least cooperative species ( see the upper panel of table [ tab : two - type ] ) .",
    "additional simulations have been performed to check that this type indeed outcompetes the other species even when it initially occupies only 5% of the lattice sites . in the neutral case , the system clusters .",
    "the spatial correlations become stronger and stronger and the boundaries of the clusters sharper and sharper as the common value of the relative ability of both species to exploit their own resources increases . observing in addition that under neutrality the number of lattice sites of a given type in the finite system is a martingale , it can be proved that the probability that this type wins is simply equal to its initial density .",
    "we now give a heuristic argument of the reason why competition translates into bistability in the absence of space whereas , excluding the neutral case , the dominant type is uniquely determined by the parameters of the system in the presence of a spatial structure .",
    "we first observe that if a species has a very high ability to exploit the resources it produces but a poor ability to exploit the other resources then , in the absence of space , the fitness of this species is roughly proportional to its density .",
    "therefore , in the presence of competition , species at low density have a negative growth rate and species at high density a positive growth rate , which implies bistability .",
    "including space in the form of local interactions drastically modifies the long - term behavior of the system due to the fact that individuals can only see their nearest neighbors rather than the whole system .",
    "more precisely , since an individual of either type can only appear next to a site already occupied by this type ( the parent site ) , spatial correlations build up in such a way that the density of individuals of a given type seen by an individual of the same type is in average significantly larger in the interacting particle system than in the mean - field approximation .",
    "regardless of the global densities , this fraction of homologous neighbors is roughly the same for both species at the interface between adjacent clusters . since in addition the resources produced at a site are only available for the nearest neighbors , the global densities become irrelevant in determining the fitness of each individual and interfaces expand linearly in favor of the least cooperative species : regardless of its initial density , this species is the dominant type .    _",
    "space and cooperation .",
    "_ in the presence of cooperation , analytical results for the nonspatial model predict coexistence of both species ( see theorem [ th : global-2 ] ) .",

    "coexistence becomes possible although there are regions in which coexistence occurs for the nonspatial model but not for the spatial model ( see theorems [ th : spatial - coexistence ] and [ th : spatial - reduction ] ) .",
    "numerical simulations of the two - dimensional finite system suggest that two cooperative species coexist in the neutral case so the coexistence region of the spatial model stretches up to the point that corresponds to voter model dynamics .",
    "as previously mentioned , analytical results for the voter model show that this critical point is included in the coexistence region if and only if the spatial dimension is strictly larger than two .",
    "there is however a wide range of parameters for which coexistence is not possible though both species cooperate ( see the lower panel of table [ tab : two - type ] ) .",
    "therefore , the inclusion of space translates into a reduction of the coexistence region in any spatial dimension .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in low dimensions and we strongly believe that the coexistence region of the spatial model approaches the one of the nonspatial model as the dimension tends to infinity .",
    "the intuition behind the fact that the inclusion of a spatial structure reduces the ability of species to coexist follows the lines of the heuristic argument introduced above . in cooperative mean - field systems , a species at very low density turns out to be in a very favorable environment due to the high density of the other species and so a large amount of resources to exploit : the smaller the density of a species , the larger the fitness of this species , which is a basic mechanism that leads to coexistence of both types .",
    "in contrast , the inclusion of local interactions translates as previously into the presence of spatial correlations that make the density of individuals of a given type seen by an individual of the other type significantly smaller in the interacting particle system than in the mean - field approximation .",
    "therefore , in the presence of a spatial structure , cooperative species can not fully benefit from the resources produced by the other species simply because these resources are geographically out of reach . under neutrality ,",
    "both species suffer local interactions equally so coexistence is possible , but when the parameters get closer to the region where one species is a cheater , individuals of the other species are unable to expand whenever they have at least one neighbor of their own type : large clusters of this species tend to shrink quickly while small clusters of this species dissolve eventually due to stochasticity .",
    "note also that the number of neighbors is smaller , and so the fraction of neighbors of the same type larger , in low dimensions hence the harmful effect of space on coexistence is more pronounced in low dimensions .",
    "the analysis of the mean - field approximation reveals that , in the presence of three species , the nonspatial model exhibits a wide variety of regimes .",
    "however , analytical and numerical results for the spatial two - type model indicate that the most interesting behaviors in terms of the inclusion of space emerge in parameter regions for which there is either bistability or coexistence for the mean - field approximation .",
    "therefore , we mainly focus on the analogous cases for the three - type models by investigating the effect of space in regions for which there is either tristability or coexistence of all three species when space is absent .",
    "we note that , whereas in the presence of two species cooperation is a necessary and sufficient condition for coexistence in a nonspatial universe , in the presence of three species , there are additional strategies that promote global coexistence .",
    "for instance , coexistence occurs for what we shall call rock - paper - scissors dynamics in which any two species can not coexist but all three species can .",
    "interestingly , numerical simulations of the spatial three - type model reveal that the inclusion of space does not have the same effect on coexistence depending on the strategies species follow , suggesting that some of the strategies that promote coexistence are much more stable than others .    in the presence of two species ,",
    "each species is either a defector or a cooperator , which results in only three types of relationship : cheating , competition , and cooperation .",
    "introducing an additional species increases significantly the number of types of relationships since a species can be a defector with respect to a second species but a cooperator with respect to the third one as in rock - paper - scissors dynamics . in order to extend to the three - type models results obtained for the two - type models , we first assume that any two species have the same ability to exploit resources produced by the third one so that each species is either a `` global '' defector or a `` global '' cooperator . under this assumption",

    "the intuition is the exact same as for the two - type model .",
    "the ability of the cheater to exploit resources of either type is larger or equal to the ability of the other two species to exploit the same resource .",

    ", the dynamics predicted by the nonspatial model under conditions - indeed reflects the dynamics of the spatial model viewed in a small region of the lattice .",

    "the long - term behavior of ecological communities involving competitive defector - defector interactions , cooperative interactions , and defector - cooperator interactions are difficult to predict mainly because the fitness of each individual depends on the environment , which induces a constant feedback between the set fitnesses and the configuration of the community . in situations where one species has a higher ability than all the other species to exploit resources of either type ,",
    "the fitness of the first species is always strictly larger than that of the other ones regardless of the configuration of the community .",
    "excluding such situations , the interacting particle system and its mean - field approximation generally disagree .",
    "this is due to the fact that the environment seen by each individual strongly differs in the presence and in the absence of a spatial structure .",
    "regardless of the size of the community , when all pairs of species are in a competitive relationship , the mean - field model predicts multistability of the system : one type eventually takes over and this dominant type is determined by the combination of both the parameters of the system and the initial densities .",
    "in contrast , in the presence of local interactions , the dominant type is uniquely determined by the parameters .",
    "the reason is that , regardless of the global densities , the fractions of species seen from the spatial interface between two types are roughly the same for both types which results in traveling waves that expand in favor of the dominant type .    in the presence of only two species ,",
    "cooperation is the only mechanism that promotes coexistence : in the absence of space , coexistence occurs if and only if cooperation occurs . introducing additional species",

    "first , even in the mean - field approximation , global cooperation alone does not result in the coexistence of all species since a too strong cooperative behavior between two species can drive the other species to extinction .",
    "in particular , that any two species can coexist does not imply that species all together can coexist .",
    "second , there are additional mechanisms that promote coexistence .",
    "rock - paper - scissors dynamics in which all pairs of species are in a defector - cooperator relationship is an example of such a mechanism . in particular , that any two species can not coexist in the absence of the other species does not imply that species all together can not coexist .",
    "another important aspect is that , at least in the presence of at most three species , whenever two species are in a competitive defector - defector relationship , global coexistence is never possible .",
    "therefore , the collection of mechanisms that promote coexistence when three species are present consist of global cooperative behavior , rock - paper - scissors type dynamics , and mixture of these two extreme cases .",
    "the effect of local interactions in the presence of either global cooperation or rock - paper - scissors dynamics is probably the most interesting aspect of our study : in the presence of mutual cooperative relationships , the inclusion of local interactions translates into a reduction of the coexistence region , whereas in the presence of rock - paper - scissors dynamics , the inclusion of local interactions translates into an expansion of the coexistence region .",
    "the intuition behind the first statement is that the fraction of individuals of a given species seen by an individual of another species is significantly smaller in the interacting particle system than in the mean - field model indicating that , in the presence of local interactions , cooperative species can not fully benefit from the resources produced by the other species .",
    "this effect is more pronounced in low spatial dimensions . finally , the intuition behind the second statement is that the behavior predicted by the mean - field model in the presence of rock - paper - scissors dynamics is only symptomatic of the local behavior of the interacting particle system seen in a fairly small region . since in addition",
    "stochasticity induces a strong asynchrony among disjoint spatial regions , when a species is driven to extinction locally , it is quickly reintroduced from nearby regions ."

    "<S> in order to understand the role of space in ecological communities where each species produces a certain type of resource and has varying abilities to exploit the resources produced by its own species and by the other species , we carry out a comparative study of an interacting particle system and its mean - field approximation . for a wide range of parameter values , we show both analytically and numerically that the spatial model results in predictions that significantly differ from its nonspatial counterpart , indicating that the use of the mean - field approach to describe the evolution of communities in which individuals only interact locally is invalid . in two - species communities , </S>",
    "<S> the disagreements between the models appear either when both species compete by producing resources that are more beneficial for their own species or when both species cooperate by producing resources that are more beneficial for the other species . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , while both species coexist if and only if they cooperate in the mean - field approximation , the inclusion of space in the form of local interactions may prevent coexistence even in cooperative communities . introducing additional species , cooperation is no longer the only mechanism that promotes coexistence . </S>",
    "<S> we prove that , in three - species communities , coexistence results either from a global cooperative behavior , or from rock - paper - scissors type interactions , or from a mixture of these dynamics , which excludes in particular all cases in which two species compete . </S>",
    "<S> finally , and more importantly , we show numerically that the inclusion of space has antagonistic effects on coexistence depending on the mechanism involved , preventing coexistence in the presence of cooperation but promoting coexistence in the presence of rock - paper - scissors interactions . </S>",
    "<S> although these results are partly proved analytically for both models , we also provide somewhat more explicit heuristic arguments to explain the reason why the models result in different predictions . </S>"
