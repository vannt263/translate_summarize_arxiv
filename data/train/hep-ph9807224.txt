    "in this paper i show how to formulate an asymptotically free theory in such a way that it includes perturbative and non - perturbative phenomena simultaneously .",
    "the idea is the following .",
    "contrary to an infrared free theory , in an asymptotically free theory the divergences prevent us from writing even perturbation expansions in a unique , well - defined way .",
    "we can , however , make use of the fact that divergences in the theory enter only the green s functions and the vertices . on the other hand , knowing the green s functions and the vertices we can express all the other amplitudes through them perturbatively in a unique way .",
    "thus , we have to formulate equations for green s functions and vertices in a form which does not contain any divergences .",
    "if this is done , the solutions of these equations will contain both perturbative and non - perturbative phenomena .    to avoid technical complications , in the first section of the paper we will derive these equations in an abelian theory",
    "in which usual perturbation theory is also well defined . in the second section",
    "we generalize the equations for a non - abelian theory and discuss the connection between perturbative and non - perturbative effects .",
    "the equations have an integro - differential structure in which the asymptotic behaviour of the green s functions is defined by the boundary conditions .",
    "the main conclusion in this section is that in the region of large momenta the green s functions of quarks and gluons contain additional parameters compared to normal perturbation theory which can be associated with different types of `` condensates '' .",
    "these non - perturbative parameters can be defined by solving the equations and finding non - singular solutions in the infrared region . a priori it is not clear what type of additional conditions have to be imposed on this system of equations in order to fix a non - singular solution .",
    "it can be , for example , the conservation of the axial current or of other currents which is formally satisfied from the point of view of the lagrangian but is not ensured because of the divergences .    in the third section",
    "we will show that these equations make it possible , for the first time , to analyse the problem of spontaneous symmetry breaking in an asymptotically free theory and to find approximately the value of the critical coupling at which symmetry breaking occurs .",
    "also , they allow us to answer the fundamental question for asymptotically free theories , namely : how the bound states  the hadrons  have to be treated in these theories and how these bound states influence the equations for the green s functions .",
    "the analysis leads to the following conclusion .",
    "the conditions for axial current conservation of flavour non - singlet currents ( in the limit of zero bare quark masses ) require that eight goldstone bosons ( the pseudo - scalar octet ) have to be regarded as elementary objects with couplings defined by ward identities .",
    "this is so in spite of the fact that the couplings of these states to fermions decrease at large fermion virtualities .",
    "the same analysis provides a new possibility for the solution of the @xmath0 problem . in this solution",
    "the flavour singlet pseudoscalar @xmath1 is a normal bound state of @xmath2 without a point - like structure .",
    "the mass of this bound state is different from zero and can be calculated in the limit of massless quarks . for massive quarks",
    "the pseudoscalar octet becomes massive .",
    "their masses , however , are not calculable in terms of bare quark masses because of logarithmic divergences and have to be regarded as unknown parameters which in the real case of confined quarks are defined by the self - consistence of the solution of the infrared problem .",
    "these states have an essential influence on the equations for the green s functions , which , as it will be shown in the next paper , can be used constructively in solving the confinement problem if the effective coupling in the infrared region is not too large . in this case",
    "the integro - differential equations can be reduced to a system of non - linear differential equations and the theory looks like a theory of particle propagation in self - consistent fields defined by the green s functions themselves ( as it is the case in landau s fermi liquid theory ) .",
    "the self - consistent fields are fields of gluons and @xmath3-mesons .",
    "in qed we have two green s functions : that of the photon @xmath4 and of the electron @xmath5 , and a vertex function @xmath6",
    ". the photon green s function is defined by the vacuum polarization operator @xmath7 which can be expressed symbolically by a sum of feynman diagrams @xmath8 in order to obtain series not containing divergences we will try to consider the derivatives of @xmath7 as functions of momenta . due to current conservation , we have @xmath9 where @xmath10 contains only logarithmic divergences .    differentiating ( [ 1.2 ] ) twice we will have @xmath11 we here use @xmath12 the second term in ( [ 1.3 ] ) does not contain divergences , the first one does . in order to obtain a finite expression , consider @xmath13 because of this , the quantity @xmath14 does not contain divergences .    in feynman gauge",
    "@xmath15 is equal @xmath16 any diagram contains only the product @xmath17 and therefore @xmath18 in first order this means @xmath19 the integrals on the right - hand - side are convergent .",
    "this fact has to hold in any order .",
    "hence , we can include in ( [ 1.8 ] ) the exact electron green s functions and the exact vertex functions and add all the corresponding diagrams which were not included . as a result",
    ", we can write @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the sum over the permutations of the indices similarly to ( [ 1.8 ] ) ; a quantity @xmath22 corresponds to each photon line .",
    "( [ 1.9 ] ) is an equation for @xmath23 ( in the form of series in @xmath23 ) provided that @xmath24 and @xmath6 are known .    in order to obtain equations for electron green s functions and vertices",
    "we have to remember that these functions can change rapidly even if @xmath23 is small because they can have infrared singularities of the type @xmath25 or ultraviolet singularities of the type @xmath26 .",
    "it is proven to be possible to arrange the differentiation in such a way that there will be an expansion only in @xmath23 .    to write an equation for the fermion green s function not containing any divergences",
    ", we have to differentiate twice the self - energy of the fermion or its inverse green s function .",
    "let us consider @xmath27 ; the diagrammatic expression for @xmath28 will be the following .",
    "the simplest diagram is @xmath29 diagrams of the next order are @xmath30 it can be easily shown that @xmath31 using this equality , we have @xmath32 @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 restricting ourselves to @xmath36 , we can write @xmath37 @xmath38 and , consequently , @xmath39 the term @xmath40 has a contribution to @xmath41 not containing overlapping divergences and is of the form @xmath42           & & + \\,\\ , {    \\setbox0=\\hbox{\\pandocstartinclude{fig22.pstex_t.tex}\\pandocendinclude{input}{21}{28 } }    \\picraise=-0.5\\ht0     \\advance\\picraise by 0.5\\dp0    \\advance\\picraise by 3pt         \\hbox{\\raise\\picraise \\box0 } } \\,\\ , + \\,\\ , {    \\setbox0=\\hbox{\\pandocstartinclude{fig23.pstex_t.tex}\\pandocendinclude{input}{21}{28 } }    \\picraise=-0.5\\ht0     \\advance\\picraise by 0.5\\dp0    \\advance\\picraise by 3pt         \\hbox{\\raise\\picraise \\box0 } }    \\label{1.12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the calculation of higher order diagrams it is convenient to adopt the following principle .",
    "beginning from the first point of interaction we shall relate the external momentum to the photon line : @xmath43 the next photon interaction can be expressed as @xmath44 now we relate the external momentum to the positron line .",
    "if the positron is emitting a photon , we keep sending the external momentum along the positron line up to its annihilation . as a result",
    ", we get a tree structure @xmath45 in which the initial photon line can end only at the final electron .",
    "it can be shown that every line in the diagram will be passed only once if the photons included in the fermion self energy are not taken into account .",
    "this means that in this approach exact electron green s functions have to be used with bare vertices since the idea is basically the exclusion of overlapping divergences . taking the second derivative of one of the photon propagators and restricting ourselves to the contribution",
    "@xmath46 we obtain both on the left - hand side and the right - hand side photon emission amplitudes with zero momentum . due to gauge invariance ,",
    "however , a zero momentum photon can not change the state of the system ( it is emitted from the external lines ) .",
    "the photon emission amplitude equals @xmath47 [ within this convention the bare vertex is @xmath48 .",
    "the final contribution of the differentiation has the structure ( [ 1.11 ] ) .",
    "the above statement , which essentially means that the emission of a zero momentum photon is determined by the total charge , can be proven by the ward identity .",
    "thus , we have @xmath49 the remaining diagrams contain first derivatives of photon and positron lines and second derivatives of positron lines .",
    "all these diagrams can be expressed in terms of the exact @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 functions .",
    "they do not contain divergences except those graphs which correspond to the photon self energy .    the first term in ( [ 1.16 ] )",
    "has the structure @xmath53 where @xmath54 is a quantity close to the compton scattering amplitude in the sense that they would be equal if we differentiated all fermion propagators including those inside the electron green s function .",
    "( the factor @xmath55 is due to the fact that the compton amplitude contains the sum of diagrams with momenta @xmath56 and @xmath57 ) .",
    "the compton scattering amplitude @xmath58 satisfies the ward identity @xmath59 which has the simple diagrammatical meaning @xmath60 the second term on the right - hand side of ( [ 1.17 ] ) represents the contribution of photons which , if we carried out the mentioned differentiation , would correspond to photons inside the green s function and which are not present in @xmath61 .",
    "hence , @xmath62    all the diagrams for @xmath63 are of the form @xmath64 and contain the photon lines with the exact green s functions ( [ 1.6 ] ) which equal @xmath65 . by differentiating the photon lines we have calculated the contribution of @xmath36 .",
    "so , there remains @xmath66 where we have introduced @xmath67 in order to avoid a contribution from @xmath68 .",
    "this expression contains logarithmic corrections coming from the ultraviolet region ( @xmath69 ) . replacing @xmath70 by @xmath71 and performing an integration by parts , we get @xmath72 the first term in ( [ 1.20 ] )",
    "can be explicitly calculated while the second one does not contain any logarithms because of the presence of the difference @xmath73 .",
    "we can rewrite ( [ 1.20 ] ) in the form @xmath74 consequently , @xmath63 can be expressed as @xmath75 where @xmath76 is defined by [ the second line of ] ( [ 1.20 ] ) and @xmath40 contains first order derivatives of the photon and positron lines and second order derivatives of the positron lines , as it has been explained above .",
    "the first term contains all singularities of the types @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "to obtain the equation for the vertex function , let us express @xmath79 as a set of diagrams containing exact green s functions : @xmath80 we shall relate the external momenta to the lines in the diagrams in the same way as we did when we derived the equation for the green s function . calculating the second order derivative in @xmath81",
    "we obtain @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the contribution to the amplitude of the process @xmath84 which corresponds to the emission of photons with momenta @xmath85 from the external legs : @xmath86 inserting ( [ 2.3 ] ) into ( [ 2.2 ] ) and replacing @xmath67 by @xmath87 we get @xmath88 here we have introduced the notations @xmath89 the correction terms @xmath90 are defined as a set of diagrams with exact green s functions and vertices .",
    "they contain first order derivatives of both the photon lines and the positron lines , second order derivatives of the positron lines and , in the same way as in the case of the green s function , corrections due to the replacement of @xmath67 by @xmath87 .",
    "the same equation is valid for the interaction amplitude of fermions with the external field provided this interaction does not depend on the relative momentum @xmath81 of the fermions .",
    "the equations for the interaction with external fields are essential . indeed ,",
    "if these equations have solutions that decrease at large virtualities of the fermions  i.e. solutions which do not require driving terms  this means the existence of bound states .    for the sake of convenience",
    "we rewrite the equation ( [ 2.4 ] ) in the form @xmath91 which will be understood as the equation for the bound state with a spin which is defined by the invariant structure of the matrix @xmath92 .",
    "it is important to note that the accuracy of the equations for the vertex @xmath79 and for the bound states differs from the accuracy of the equation for the green s function . the functions @xmath79 and @xmath93 depend , among others , on the ratios @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "if these parameters become large , then @xmath50 and @xmath93 contain , in general , the so - called sudakov logarithms which are not included in the equations ( [ 2.4 ] ) and ( [ 2.6 ] ) .",
    "hence , the equations are valid only if @xmath96",
    "qcd is the theory of interacting quarks and gluons .",
    "the description of quarks is more or less the same as in qed .",
    "gluons , however , are very different .",
    "even the fact that being a spin @xmath97 particle the gluon has to have a multi - component wave function is not seen explicitly . in the usual approach",
    "it is described by a green s function @xmath98 which in momentum space ( in feynman gauge ) always can be written in the form @xmath99 it contains only one unknown function .",
    "all spin properties of the gluon are included in the momentum dependence of its interaction . in order to introduce multi - component green s functions",
    ", we have to formulate the theory in a form in which the interaction is momentum independent : we have to replace the usual description of the gluons and their interactions by a duffin - kemmer type formulation . in the framework of this description",

    "because of this , when we regard the equations for @xmath169 and @xmath170 in the way we did for the fermionic green s function in qed , @xmath166 has to disappear .",
    "consequently , we have equations for @xmath169 and @xmath170 with @xmath172 being arbitrary .",
    "the equation for @xmath173 will not help since , due to the equality @xmath171 it has to be an identity .",
    "we will see that an equation for @xmath164 appears when we will consider the correction of the order of @xmath174 .    before formulating the equation for the green s function ,",

    "the equation contains the amplitude @xmath420 of the transition between the goldstone and the axial current .",
    "the expression ( [ 5.15 ] ) for @xmath437 is highly symbolic , because it contains overlapping divergences . in order to write a sensible expression",
    "we can use the same procedure as in section [ i ] where we calculated the polarization operator of the photon . applying the ward identity , we can write instead of ( [ 5.15 ] ) @xmath438 differentiating ( [ 5.22 ] ) over @xmath226 we will get for @xmath388 @xmath439 [ this diagrammatic expression contains exact fermion propagators and bare vertices . ]",
    "if we want to get rid of the @xmath440-s we have to commute @xmath440 with the green s functions and the interaction vertices along one of the fermionic lines . doing this , we obtain @xmath441 due to the conservation of the vector current , the first two terms in ( [ 5.24 ] ) are zero at @xmath388 .",
    "the first one is just the photon polarization operator at @xmath388 , the second one is the amplitude for the decay of a zero momentum scalar into two zero - momentum photons .",
    "the last term looks like the zero - momentum pseudoscalar - photon scattering amplitude which also has to be zero .",
    "this , however , is not true , because it does not contain all the necessary diagrams . observing that this term does not contain overlapping divergences we can write @xmath442 in the zeroth order in @xmath443 , @xmath444",
    "up to now we discussed the goldstone states in a relatively abstract way without fixing the concrete asymptotically free theory . in real qcd",
    "we have quarks with different flavours and there is a difference between flavour singlet and flavour non - singlet states . in order to clarify the picture it will be useful to describe the goldstone state in a different way .",
    "the previous discussion shows that the goldstone states in asymptotically free and non - free theories are rather similar .",
    "therefore it is natural to try to introduce the goldstone boson in the usual way as a point - like state and to see how this state will interact . in the usual discussion of a goldstone particle",
    "we suppose that there is a point - like pseudoscalar interaction between this particle and a fermion with the pseudovector coupling @xmath445 this interaction induces the radiative correction to the propagator @xmath446 of the pseudoscalar @xmath447 where the wavy line describes the bare pseudoscalar green s function @xmath124 .",
    "if the fermion is massless and the axial current is conserved , this pseudoscalar will not interact ; its self - energy @xmath448 is equal to zero .",
    "if , due to symmetry breaking , the fermion becomes massive , it starts to interact and acquires a self - energy different from zero . by using the diagrammatic definition of @xmath449",
    "[ see ( [ 5.22 ] ) ] , we will find @xmath450 where @xmath420 is the same amplitude for the goldstone - current transition as what was discussed in the previous section .",
    "hence , @xmath451 in the limit @xmath452 we will have @xmath453 the pseudovector interaction between goldstone and fermion is @xmath454 with a pseudovector coupling @xmath455 defined by the fermion mass .",
    "the limiting procedure @xmath452 can be understood if we accept that the interaction responsible for symmetry breaking changes the fermion vacuum fluctuations not only at finite momenta but also near the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "this change in the fermion vacuum fluctuations is responsible for the leakage of the axial current in [ from ] the region of finite momenta ; it can produce the driving term for the goldstone state , recovering the current conservation .",
    "in general , the pseudovector coupling has a disadvantage compared to the pseudoscalar coupling which we have discussed before : it looks unrenormalizable .",
    "but in the case of flavour non - singlet states it can always be replaced by the pseudoscalar coupling with the help of the trivial relation [ @xmath418 @xmath456 which leads to the ward identity ( [ 5.14 ] ) for pseudoscalar coupling .",
    "if we include the emission and the absorption of goldstone bosons inside the diagram , then in the process of this replacement a point - like amplitude appears which corresponds to the quark interaction with many goldstone bosons .",
    "nevertheless i believe it is possible to prove that , due to the decrease of these amplitude as functions of quark virtuality , the theory is renormalizable .    due to the anomaly , the case of a flavour singlet current is very different even on the level of the goldstone green s function . in this case the corresponding polarization operator @xmath139 will contain not only the quark loop which we have discussed but also a gluonic contribution @xmath457 the triangle diagram @xmath458 present in ( [ 6.8 ] ) was calculated many years ago by adler , bell and jackiw [ 3 ] @xmath459 with this expression for @xmath458 , @xmath460 still has the form ( [ 6.4 ] ) but it will be quadratically divergent and @xmath461 where @xmath462 is the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "this means that goldstone particles exist in the anomalous case but they are decoupled from all physical states . at the same time the ward identity still makes sense because the product @xmath424 does not depend on @xmath420 .",
    "nevertheless , the concrete form of the ward identity will change .",
    "the reason for this is again the adler - bell - jackiw anomaly [ 3 ] . for the triangle diagram @xmath463 the replacement of the pseudovector coupling by the pseudoscalar coupling gives an incorrect result : instead of the correct expression @xmath464 which was obtained in [ 3 ]",
    ", we get just the first term .",
    "we can try to write the ward identity using ( [ 6.12 ] ) , but this turns out not to be necessary .",
    "the reason is that in this approach the axial current @xmath465 between gluonic states , defined symbolically by the relation @xmath466 ( where the term @xmath467 is defined diagrammatically and @xmath468 ) is just the transverse part of @xmath467 : @xmath469 the axial current between quark states @xmath470 can be written as @xmath471 here @xmath472 is the same set of diagrams as in the non - singlet case and @xmath473 is the `` axial current of gluons '' @xmath474 in the same way the goldstone - quark interaction can also be divided into two parts . in the first part we can replace the pseudovector coupling by the pseudoscalar coupling .",
    "the second part is the longitudinal part of @xmath473 .",
    "consequently , @xmath475 and the ward identity can be written in the form @xmath476 this expression enables us to answer the question , what happens with particles like @xmath1 which would be goldstone states if we did not take into account that they can decay into two gluons .",

    "the divergence @xmath477 has a pole corresponding to @xmath1 : @xmath478 the yukawa coupling of the goldstone state has also a pole : @xmath479 the right - hand side of ( [ 6.19 ] ) has , however , no poles .",
    "this condition can be satisfied if @xmath480 the same ward identity ( [ 6.19 ] ) [ substituting ( [ 6.20 ] ) , ( [ 6.21 ] ) and using ( [ 6.22 ] ) ] gives at @xmath387 @xmath481 from which equation it follows that @xmath482 for @xmath1 is equal ] @xmath483 this means that @xmath1 acquired a mass due to the transition into a goldstone boson which itself is decoupled .",
    "it is interesting to notice that at relatively small @xmath482 when the comparison between ward identities for different values of @xmath391 ( @xmath484 , @xmath387 ) makes sense , ( [ 6.24 ] ) gives us the same result as the equation ( [ 5.9 ] ) ( without the additional point - like term which is present in the @xmath3-meson case ( [ 5.21 ] ) ) . indeed , in ( [ 5.9",
    "] ) we can write @xmath485 the sum of the first two terms is equal to @xmath391 ( as in ( [ 5.21 ] ) ) and therefore @xmath486 in agreement with ( [ 6.24 ] ) ) and ( [ 6.25 ] ) have different signs ; see the previous footnote . ] ] .",
    "we see that the subtraction term in the @xmath3-meson self - energy , reflecting the quasi - local structure of the pion , disappears in the case of @xmath1 . in this sense @xmath1",
    "is a normal bound state without a point - like structure .",
    "the approach we presented here for the resolution of the @xmath0-problem is technically very close to the approach developed by veneziano [ 4 ] but the underlying physics differs essentially . in veneziano s",
    "approach big long - range fluctuations are responsible for the @xmath1 mass . in our approach",
    "@xmath1 is a normal @xmath2 bound state with no local structure which would be responsible for its small mass if it were a goldstone state .",
    "this local structure is destroyed by the decay on hard gluons .",
    "we have discussed in detail an asymptotically free theory with massless fermions .",
    "we came to the conclusion that in order to obtain the correct spectrum of goldstone particles , axial current conservation has to be imposed on the theory .",
    "qcd , however , contains massive quarks and the same spectrum of massive quasi - goldstone particles ( the pseudo - scalar octet ) as the theory with massless quarks .",
    "the problem is , how to impose the condition of axial current conservation on a theory which obviously does not conserve the axial current .",
    "strictly speaking ,",
    "i do nt know how to do this . for our real world",
    ", however , there is a natural possibility to solve the problem .    in the real world qcd",
    "is part of the standard model describing strong , electromagnetic and weak interactions . in the standard model all particles",
    "are supposed to be intrinsically massless and their masses appear as the result of symmetry breaking due to some kind of higgs mechanism with or without elementary higgs particles .",
    "the possibility of such a mechanism is guaranteed by the conservation of the left - handed @xmath487current @xmath488 . for the matrix elements @xmath489 of this current between any two quarks with momenta @xmath490 , @xmath491",
    ", we have the ward identity [ @xmath418 @xmath492 in the case of massive fermions @xmath493 contains the contribution of three goldstone bosons responsible for the masses of @xmath494 and @xmath495 : @xmath496.\\ ] ] for large @xmath273-values @xmath28 contains a massive term @xmath497 .",
    "hence , at large @xmath273 we have @xmath498 .\\ ] ] at small @xmath273 of the order of the qcd scale , @xmath499 is defined by the total quark mass @xmath307 which for the light quark is much larger than @xmath329 . using the relations ( [ 7.1 ] )  ( [ 7.3 ] ) we can calculate the masses of the pseudoscalar octet in the same way as we did for @xmath1 .",
    "suppose there is a bound state of light quarks which is a pseudoscalar particle ( the @xmath3-meson ) with a finite mass @xmath402 .",
    "the pole corresponding to this particle will contribute to both terms in ( [ 7.2 ] ) . with this pole contribution ,",
    "@xmath500 and @xmath499 can be written in the form [ with @xmath501 standing for `` non - pion '' or `` non - pole '' ] @xmath502 @xmath503 as in the case of @xmath1 , the condition for the pole cancellation gives us the value of @xmath482 : @xmath504 at @xmath387 we have @xmath505.\\ ] ] [ here @xmath506 is the light - quark mass matrix , @xmath507 , with @xmath508 . ]",
    "the yukawa coupling @xmath509 of the bound state has to decrease at large @xmath273 .",
    "therefore we have to identify @xmath510 with @xmath511 .",
    "then @xmath512 where @xmath513 is the isotopically invariant part of the quark mass term behaving at @xmath409 as @xmath514 .",
    "finally , @xmath515 is defined by weak interactions with goldstone states , and @xmath516 is determined by pion exchange .",
    "the conclusion of these considerations is that in the case of massive quarks the conservation of the left - handed @xmath487 current can play the same role for the calculation of the coupling and the masses of the flavour non - singlet pseudoscalar particles as in the massless case the conservation of the axial current .",
    "the result is that the masses become different from zero while the yukawa coupling remains the same at least for small @xmath329 values .",
    "the expression ( [ 7.6 ] ) for @xmath482 can be also obtained without discussing the current conservation , just by calculating @xmath517 as it is defined by ( [ 5.21 ] ) for the quark mass @xmath518 , keeping only the term linear in @xmath329 .",
    "it is in agreement with the idea that @xmath329 affects the mass of the goldstone state but not its wave function , which always has been the common belief .",
    "it is not trivial that , if we calculate @xmath482 by using ( [ 7.6 ] ) or ( [ 5.21 ] ) , we get a logarithmic divergence . for the @xmath3-meson mass",
    "the main divergent part equals @xmath519 ( here @xmath520 is of the order of @xmath294 ) .    in the standard model",
    "the behaviour of @xmath329 and @xmath521 can be calculated in a fantastically wide region of @xmath273 : from 1 gev up to the scale where one of the couplings of the standard model ( the @xmath0-coupling @xmath522 , the yukawa coupling @xmath523 or the coupling of the self - interaction of the higgs particles , @xmath524 ) becomes of the order of unity . if the @xmath0-coupling @xmath522 is the first to become large , which seems natural , this scale is @xmath525 gev .",
    "at @xmath526 the behaviour of @xmath329 and @xmath521 is unknown .",
    "because of this , @xmath527 is not calculable in principle and it has to be considered as an arbitrary parameter .",
    "if we , however , assume that at @xmath273 larger than @xmath462 , @xmath528 and @xmath529 vanish , we will be able to calculate @xmath527 and , surprisingly , this calculation gives a reasonable value for @xmath527 with @xmath525 gev [ 2 ] .",
    "the expression ( [ 7.9 ] ) for @xmath530 is also in agreement with the naive expression @xmath531 the important difference is that now @xmath532 is determined not only by strong but also by weak interactions : it goes to infinity if the weak interaction is removed .",
    "from the previous discussion it is obvious that the small - mass pion contribution has to be included in the equation for the light - quark green s function .",
    "fortunately this is very easy to do .",
    "having in mind that now the diagrams contain not only the gluon contribution but also the emission and the absorption of pions we will find that as before , the main contribution to @xmath63 comes from the simplest diagram 0= = -0.50 by 0.50 by 3pt with the coupling @xmath533 at zero momentum instead of the gluon coupling @xmath534 .",
    "it leads to the following equation for the green s function : @xmath535 the equation for bound states ( [ 2.6 ] ) has also to be changed .",
    "the correction comes from the diagrams @xmath536 instead of ( [ 2.6 ] ) we will have @xmath537.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath524 is the emission amplitude of the zero momentum pion in the transition of the bound state to the @xmath2-pair .",
    "this amplitude has to be defined by the axial current conservation .",
    "there is another important quantity in this equation , namely : @xmath538 . in section [ v ]",
    "we have written an explicit expression for @xmath539 including only the gauge field contribution and ignoring the pion contribution .",
    "now we include the pion contribution in the equation for the green s function and , to be self - consistent , we have to do the same for @xmath539 .",
    "i was not able to carry out this in any order in the yukawa coupling , but in the first order in @xmath266 the equation ( [ 5.25 ] ) is correct if one adds the diagrams @xmath540 as we see , the gluonic correction of the order of @xmath443 and the pionic correction of the order of @xmath266 have the same diagrammatic structure . in order to estimate the value of these corrections ,",
    "let us take just the contributions of zero momentum gluons and pions to them .",
    "it can be shown that the contribution of zero momentum gluons cancels in the last two diagrams of ( [ 5.25 ] ) .",
    "zero momentum pion contribution comes only from the first diagram of ( [ 8.3 ] ) .",
    "transferring the differentiation from the fermionic line to the pionic line in this diagram we obtain the contribution of zero momentum pions in the form @xmath541 the expression for @xmath539 which includes the zero - momentum pion contribution is @xmath542 it gives us an understanding of the scale of possible pion contributions .",
    "it is interesting to note , that ( [ 8.5 ] ) is not an expression in terms of the green s functions but an equation for @xmath538 .    in the next paper",
    "we will show that the pion contribution changes essentially the structure of the equation for the green s function .",
    "the new equation has a solution corresponding to the confined quark . at the same time the symmetry breaking solution will not necessarily survive ( at least if @xmath67 is large ) .",
