    "inspiraling compact binaries of stellar mass neutron stars or black holes are among the most important gravitational wave sources accessible to the current generation of ground - based interferometric gravitational wave detectors @xcite .",
    "they are also very `` clean '' systems , in the sense that the gravitational wave signal arising from the inspiral depends only on general relativity ( i.e. , the structure of the binary components is unimportant ) and can be calculated to great accuracy by the well - understood techniques of post - newtonian perturbation theory @xcite . for these reasons , matched filtering and maximum likelihood techniques are well - suited for the detection and characterization of the signal from these systems @xcite and an implementation based on these methods is currently used in the analysis of data from the ligo and geo detectors @xcite .",
    "the gravitational wave signature of inspiral binary systems depends on a set of 15 parameters that characterize the system ( i.e. , component masses , orbital energy and angular momentum at a given epoch , component spins , orientation relative to detector line of sight ) .",
    "to identify an incident signal using a matched filter requires the application of a fair sampling of filter `` templates '' , each defined by a unique choice of the parameters associated with the physical system .",
    "current implementations of matched filtering used in the analysis of gravitational wave detector data involve a very dense sampling of the two - dimensional parameter subspace corresponding to the binary component masses ( intrinsic parameter space ) and assuming zero eccentricity orbits and no body spins in the ligo detector band is several hundred gflops / s @xcite .",
    "when significant body spin is allowed the computational cost grows by several orders of magnitude @xcite . ] : the templates are spaced so closely that the correlation between templates at neighboring points in the subspace is 97% @xcite .",
    "we refer to this as the `` dense '' search strategy .",
    "the rationale underlying the dense search strategy is to reduce the probability that a weak signal , characterized by parameters that fall between those sampled , will be missed by the sampling .",
    "here we describe a straightforward and practical way of using interpolation to take advantage of the correlation between the matched filter output associated with nearby points in the parameter space to significantly reduce the number of matched filter evaluations without sacrificing the efficiency with which real signals are recognized .",
    "we are not the first to observe the significance of the high correlation between neighboring templates nor to consider the opportunity for and advantages of interpolation as part of the implementation of matched filtering for the analysis of binary inspiral signals .",
    "the significance of the high correlation as an indication that fewer templates should be able to recover signals with the same efficiency , was first made in @xcite .",
    "croce et al @xcite explored the use of cardinal interpolation with a truncated sinc function to estimate the value of the matched filter output when the filter used corresponds to the actual parameters that describe the signal .",
    "they found a sampling of parameter space that would insure the interpolated estimate would be no less than 97% of the maximum over a two dimensional intrinsic parameter space . their sampling and interpolation reduced by a factor of 4 , compared to the dense search , the number of templates required to search over a two dimensional intrinsic parameter space .",
    "here we find that we can achieve the same increase in efficiency per parameter space dimension with a simpler template spacing and a simpler and quicker to evaluate interpolation function .",
    "other suggestions have been made for reducing the number of matched filter evaluations without sacrificing detection efficiency .",
    "one promising proposal involves a hierarchical search strategy , wherein a low - threshold trigger generated by the evaluation of the matched filters associated with a much coarser sampling of parameter space followed by ( if necessary ) a higher threshold evaluation matched filters over a much finer sampling of parameter space @xcite .",
    "the interpolation proposal we make here is complementary in the sense that it can be implemented together with the hierarchical strategies that have already been proposed to further improve the computational efficiency of binary inspiral analysis . while the gain in efficiency of the interpolated search over the dense search is approximately constant in the desired false alarm probability , the balance between the coarseness of the grids in the hierarchical steps , the number of hierarchical steps , and the gain in computational efficiency associated with the interpolation is not obvious and requires further study .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ gen_method ] we describe the motivation behind our choice of interpolating function and the difference between our choice and the choice made in @xcite . in section  [ sec : comparison ] we describe in detail the dense and interpolated search strategies , the two - dimensional template space used in current gravitational wave data analyses for inspiraling binary neutron stars , the one - dimensional restriction that we use here to compare the effectiveness of the interpolating search strategy , and ( finally ) compare the performance of the interpolated and dense search strategies by evaluating the sensitivity of each at fixed computational cost and the computational cost required by each to achieve the same sensitivity .",

    "focus attention first on the case where @xmath1 is a scalar @xmath10 .",
    "one particular choice of interpolant @xmath11 , which is especially important in the context of communication theory , is based on the whittaker cardinal function @xmath12 : @xmath13 where @xmath14 shannon @xcite showed that the cardinal interpolation @xmath15 of @xmath16 is the unique interpolant @xmath17 that _ ( i ) _ takes on the values @xmath9 at the @xmath18 , _ ( ii ) _ has no singularities , and _ ( iii ) _ and whose spectrum is limited to a bandwidth @xmath19 . correspondingly , if @xmath20 is bandlimited in @xmath10 and has the values @xmath9 at the equidistant sampled points @xmath18 then @xmath20 is equal to @xmath15 . in the case",

    "cardinal interpolation using the cardinal function @xmath12 forms the basis of the interpolation formula used in @xcite .",
    "if @xmath26 is bandlimited and we choose our samples of @xmath0 appropriately then we can do no better than using the cardinal function to interpolate values of @xmath0 between the samples . in our problem , however , @xmath26 is not bandlimited and we do not have an infinite number of sample points @xmath9 ; correspondingly , the cardinal function @xmath27 is at best an approximation to @xmath26 . with that understanding the cardinal interpolation @xmath27",

    "one can clearly see that the proper value of the ambiguity function at the maximum of the interpolating function is more than the maximum value of the interpolating function and this is what we gain by placing a template at the maximum of the interpolating function .",

    "<S> because the computational cost of the analysis is driven almost exclusively the matched filter evaluations , a reduction in the number of templates evaluations translates directly into an increase in computational efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> because the computational cost of the analysis is large , the increased efficiency translates also into an increase in the size of the parameter space that can be analyzed and , thus , the science that can be accomplished with the data . as a demonstration </S>",
    "<S> we compare the present `` dense sampling '' analysis methodology with our proposed `` interpolation '' methodology , restricted to one dimension of the multi - dimensional analysis problem . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the interpolated search reduces by 25% the number of filter evaluations required by the dense search with 97% correlation to achieve the same efficiency of detection for an expected false alarm probability . </S>",
    "<S> generalized to the two dimensional space used in the computationally - limited current analyses this suggests a factor of two increase in computational efficiency ; generalized to the full seven dimensional parameter space that characterizes the signal associated with an eccentric binary system of spinning neutron stars or black holes it suggests an order of magnitude increase in computational efficiency . </S>"
