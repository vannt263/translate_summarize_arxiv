    "time series photometry from the kepler k2 mission @xcite has led to the discovery of a number of interesting eclipsing binary systems . a particular example and the subject of this paper is an eccentric orbit binary associated with epic  202062176 @xcite .",
    "this star sits at the center of a young cluster of stars embedded in the h  ii region sh  2 - 252e , which in turn is one of six young clusters associated with the large , diffuse h  ii region , ngc  2174 ( sh 2 - 252 , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "all these clusters have an estimated age of 5  myr or less , consistent with the age of the primary ionizing source , the o6.5  v star hd  42088 @xcite .",
    "we analyzed the k2 campaign 0 light curve of epic  202062176 in order to determine the system s orbital elements .",
    "however , there are over 100 main sequence and pre - main sequence stars in the embedded cluster surrounding epic  202062176 @xcite .",
    "the large k2 c0 photometric aperture actually records the flux of dozens of stars including several relatively bright and close by targets , seen in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 images in figure  [ ctio ] .",
    "therefore , there is real uncertainty about which star in the vicinity of epic  202062176 is actually the eclipsing binary . in order to solve this problem , we obtained spectra of the three brightest stars within the k2 c0 aperture based on the color - magnitude diagram of these stars , shown in figure [ cmd ] .",
    "the names and coordinates of our targets are listed in table  [ coord ] .",
    "the brightest target in sh  2 - 252e is sh  2 - 252a , an early b - type star that corresponds to epic  202062176 .",
    "sh  2 - 252a has been studied in the past using both multi - band photometry and low resolution spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "the second brightest target is sh  2 - 252b , a herbig ae star located @xmath2 southwest of sh  2 - 252a @xcite .",
    "the third brightest target is a star @xmath3 southeast of sh  2 - 252a , which we call sh  2 - 252c .",

    "these spectra were reduced using standard procedures in iraf , transformed onto a heliocentric wavelength grid , and continuum normalized .",
    "the k2 c0 light curve of epic  202062176 exhibits shallow eclipses as well as low amplitude variations , possibly caused by stellar pulsation or rotational modulation of star spots .",
    "we used the program period04 @xcite to determine these photometric periods by completing a fourier transform of the eclipse - free light curve .",
    "the resulting power spectrum revealed only two strong periods , @xmath6 days and @xmath7 days , as shown in figure [ powerspec ] .",
    "we subtracted a model of these periodicities from the observed light curve in order to isolate the eclipses , as shown in the middle panel of figure [ pulsations ] .",
    "we folded the k2 c0 light curve based on the orbital period and epoch of primary eclipse found by @xcite , @xmath8 days and @xmath9 bjd 2456775.899 . figure [ foldedlc ] shows the folded light curve . from the eclipse durations and separations , we calculated the eccentricity , @xmath10 , and longitude of periastron , @xmath11 , which are consistent with the values found by @xcite .",
    "we then used a light curve synthesis program , eclipsing light curve code ( elc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to model the eclipses and determine the orbital parameters of the eclipsing binary .",
    "the period , epoch of primary eclipse , eccentricity , and longitude of periastron were held fixed while we varied other parameters , such as the inclination , roche lobe filling factors , and @xmath12 ratio .",
    "we also assumed a mass ratio @xmath13 , although the solutions are relatively insensitive to this estimate .",
    "table [ elctable ] lists the best - fit parameter estimates , found by visual inspection .",
    "figure [ foldedlc ] shows the best - fit elc model .",
    "the eclipse depths of the eclipsing binary are only 3 - 4% percent , which implies a relatively low inclination . however , reducing the inclination was not enough to match the observed light curve . by fitting elc models with different third light components , we found that a third light contribution of 90% is needed to dilute accurately the eclipses , i.e. , 90% of the total flux comes from nebular and stellar light from sh  2 - 252e while only 10% comes from the binary itself .",
    "however , there is a limited family of solutions due to the direct correlation between inclination and third light contamination : the inclination ranges from @xmath14 for a contamination factor of @xmath15 , to @xmath16 for a contamination factor of @xmath17 .",
    "the increase in flux between eclipses ( at phase @xmath18 ) due to tidal distortions provided a lower limit to the inclination and contamination factor , because the models with inclinations lower than @xmath19 and low contamination display a much larger increase in flux than that found in the observed light curve ( figure [ foldedlc ] ) .",

    "due to reflected continuum light from the surrounding nebula @xcite , all of the absorption lines are shallower in the observed spectrum than in the model spectra . to avoid problems of absolute line strength , we measured the ratios of the equivalent widths of several absorption lines in our observed spectrum and in tlusty models of various effective temperatures ( @xmath12 ) and surface gravities ( @xmath28 ) .",

    "figure [ siiii ] also demonstrates how sharp are the absorption lines of sh  2 - 252a .",
    "we found the projected rotational velocity ( @xmath36 ) of sh  2 - 252a by first scaling the line depths of the model spectrum to match the depths of the chiron spectrum .",

    "the spectra of sh  2 - 252a show strong nebular emission lines , such as the balmer series and several forbidden lines , from the diffuse h ii region ( ngc 2174 ) and nebulosity ( sh  2 - 252e ) near sh  2 - 252a .",
    "@xcite found that the balmer lines originate from both ngc 2174 and sh  2 - 252e , while the [ ] and [ ] lines originate only from sh  2 - 252e .",

    "h@xmath40 was saturated in one or more of the three exposures for each night of chiron observations , so we only used exposures where h@xmath40 is unsaturated .",
    "nights when all three exposures are saturated are left blank in the table .",
    "this measurement was made using numerical integration across the emission line profile , with the baseline determined by a linear fit between endpoints of the line .",
    "sh  2 - 252a is much brighter than sh  2 - 252b or sh  2 - 252c , so the nebular emission lines do not appear as strong relative to the bright continuum of sh  2 - 252a .",
    "we measured the radial velocity ( @xmath41 ) of each chiron spectrum using cross - correlation with a tlusty model spectrum of @xmath42 k. we combined the results of multiple echelle orders to calculate the average @xmath41 for each night , listed in table [ rvtable ] .",

    "no prior spectroscopic observations or spectral classifications have been made for this star .",

    "first , there is no evidence of broad hydrogen absorption under the nebular emission , which suggests that sh  2 - 252c is a cooler , lower mass star .",
    "second , we were able to identify several , , and absorption lines , as well as possible , , and absorption lines .",

    "we used a model with @xmath73 k , corresponding to a k2 star and the approximate spectral type of sh  2 - 252c .",
    "an example part of the spectrum is shown in figure [ order72 ] , which shows only marginal agreement with the observed spectrum due to the low signal to noise ratio of our spectrum and contamination with emission components in some lines .",

    "we do not find any absorption lines with these radial velocities nor do we see any evidence of double lines , which excludes sh  2 - 252c as a possible component of the eclipsing binary system .",
    "we conclude that epic  202062176 is not actually the eclipsing binary itself , but its measured flux is contaminated by a nearby binary in the k2 c0 aperture .",
    "the eclipses are highly diluted by light from nearby stars and the surrounding nebulosity within the large aperture , with the binary contributing only 10% of the total flux .",
    "we also found that the component stars are similar in effective temperature and therefore are likely similar masses .",
    "this young , eccentric binary would be an interesting target for studies on apsidal motion due to its young , low mass components and close orbit .",
    "assuming @xmath75 , the semi - major axis of the eclipsing binary system is @xmath76 . combining this with the relative radii determined by elc , the individual stellar radii are thus @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the primary and secondary stars are larger than the expected main sequence radius and are likely pre - main sequence stars .",
    "the periastron distance of the two stars is @xmath79 , much larger than @xmath80 , suggesting that the two components are completely detached .",
    "further work to identify the eclipsing binary could include time series photometry with better spatial resolution than kepler or spectroscopic observations of the other nearby stars .",
    "we ruled out the three brightest stars as possible members of the eclipsing binary , so other candidates are the next two brightest stars within the photometric aperture : 2mass 06095246 + 2030029 ( @xmath81 ) and 2mass 06095300 + 2030011 ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "these stars are labeled on the color - magnitude diagram in figure [ cmd ] .",
    "the remaining nearby stars are very faint ( @xmath83 ) and do not contribute enough light to be probable members of the eclipsing binary system .",
    "the other intriguing element of the k2 c0 light curve was the low amplitude variation , with @xmath6 days and @xmath7 days .",
    "one explanation is that these variations are caused by pulsations of sh  2 - 252a .",
    "the pulsation periods are too long for the @xmath84-mode pulsations of @xmath85 cephei and @xmath86 scuti stars , but the periods are consistent with the @xmath87-mode pulsations of @xmath88 doradus and slowly - pulsating b stars @xcite .",
    "however , the spectral type of sh  2 - 252a is much earlier than the usual spectral types of these pulsating stars .",
    "a more plausible explanation would be that the observed variations are caused by the rotational modulation of star spots .",
    "sh  2 - 252a is not a likely source , because its slow rotation would create variations with much longer periods . on the other hand ,",
    "these periods are reasonable for the rotation of sh  2 - 252b and sh  2 - 252c .    even though we excluded sh  2 - 252a ( epic  202062176 ) , sh  2 - 252b , and sh  2 - 252c as components of the eclipsing binary system , these stars are still very interesting .",
    "sh  2 - 252a is a b0.5  v star with remarkably sharp absorption lines .",
    "we found @xmath89 km  s@xmath37 , which is very slow even for a low inclination .",
    "this is very surprising for such a young , early type star that would have been born with high angular momentum from the molecular cloud .",
    "it is possible that the low @xmath90 is due to a small inclination , but the probability is low that we view the star with a pole - on orientation .",
    "alternatively , sh  2 - 252a could have been spun down by a magnetic field , the case for many early - type slow rotators .",
    "for example , @xcite found that three of the four hottest b stars with magnetic fields are very sharp - lined .",
    "one of these is @xmath91 sco , a well studied magnetic b0.2  v star with @xmath92 km  s@xmath37 @xcite , similar to sh  2 - 252a .",
    "furthermore , about 10% of b stars have magnetic fields @xcite , and young massive stars are even more likely to have magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "therefore , sh  2 - 252a is possibly a magnetic star due to its slow rotation and young age .",
    "if it is magnetic , the strong magnetic field required to slow its rotation in only 5 myr would likely be detectable , making sh  2 - 252a a promising target for the study of magnetic o and b stars . the magnetic field of sh  2 - 252a",
    "could also have influenced the accretion disk during its formation and even confined the outflow of debris to create the dark dust band seen in figure [ ctio ] .",
    "next , sh  2 - 252b is a herbig a0e star with a double - peaked h@xmath40 profile , evidence of a circumstellar disk .",
    "sh  2 - 252c is likely a low mass pre - main sequence star due to its ir excess , over - brightness , and possible dilution from circumstellar gas and dust . while we concluded that these stars are not components of the binary system itself",
    ", we can not exclude the possibility that they could be a distant third companion to the binary system .",
    "nonetheless the eclipsing binary in sh  2 - 252e was clearly born in a dense environment with remarkable neighbors , and further efforts to identify the binary among the cluster stars will help elucidate its role in the early dynamical evolution of the cluster ."
