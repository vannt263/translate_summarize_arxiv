    "<S> it has recently been pointed out that cdf data for the cross section of high-@xmath0 charged particles show an excess of up to three orders of magnitude over qcd predictions , a feature tentatively ascribed to possible violations of factorisation . </S>",

    "<S> combining this information with data on charged particle distributions within jets allows us to rule out the hypothesis that the cdf data could be interpreted in terms of qcd factorisation violation . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , the cdf collaboration at the tevatron collider has published measurements of the inclusive charged particle spectrum at transverse momenta , @xmath0 , up to @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> these data are based on a minimum - bias trigger sample consisting of about 16000000 events and a smaller high track - multiplicity trigger sample . in its analysis , cdf compared the data to monte carlo predictions for a somewhat larger minimum - bias sample from the pythia event generator @xcite and found that approaching @xmath3 the data exceeded predictions by about a factor of three . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison was not extended beyond @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , albino , kniehl and kramer @xcite presented a comparison of the cdf data to a nlo qcd calculation involving parton distribution functions and fragmentation functions from global fits . </S>",
    "<S> such a calculation should be more precise than predictions from pythia and should have better constrained uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it covers the full extent of the high-@xmath0 region in which there are data . </S>",
    "<S> the striking observation in @xcite is that in the highest @xmath0 bin , @xmath4 , the data exceed qcd predictions by a factor of up to @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> independent work by arleo , denterria and yoon @xcite , which appeared while our note was being finalised , made the same observation and also compared to a pythia sample that covered the whole @xmath0 range , confirming the findings of a large excess . </S>",
    "<S> this excess is illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : charged+pythia ] , where we compare the data to the combination of a pythia minimum - bias sample in the low-@xmath0 range with dijet samples at high @xmath0 .        in interpreting their findings , the authors of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite argue that the comparison of data and theory challenges the validity of qcd factorisation , requiring a drastic modification either to the theoretical calculation or the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we can investigate the question of factorisation in more detail by comparing the charged - particle data to tevatron data on inclusive jet production . </S>",

    "<S> the right - hand plot shows the ratio of the charged particle to jet spectra . </S>",

    "<S> an interpretation of this kind is in contradiction with cdf data on charged particle spectra within jets , such as fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cdf - fig20 ] , taken from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite : for a dijet mass range of @xmath9 , corresponding to @xmath10 , those data show that only about @xmath11 of jets contain a charged hadron carrying at least @xmath12 of the jet momentum .. a second restriction of @xcite is that it only considers events in which the two hardest jets are well - balanced in @xmath0 and any 3rd or 4th jet is much softer than the two leading ones . while this does not affect conclusions about the validity of qcd fragmentation within jets , it can have implications for alternative explanations of the origin of the excess . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the argument can be further refined by noting that the jet spectrum @xmath13 falls as @xmath14 with @xmath15 in the relevant @xmath0 range and that the measured inclusive charged particle momentum - fraction distribution within the jet , @xmath16 , does not depend too strongly on the jet @xmath0 . by taking the @xmath17 moment of @xmath16 , @xmath18 , as determined from the points in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : cdf - fig20 ] , one then derives an expectation for the ratio of charged - particle and jet inclusive spectra . </S>",
    "<S> numerically this turns out to be of order @xmath19 with uncertainties of a few tens of percent ( related to the exact choice of @xmath20 and the finite size of the bins of the data for @xmath16 ) . </S>",
    "<S> such a result is consistent with the predictions of parton shower programs like pythia ( cf .  the two pythia curves in fig .  [ fig : charged+jets ] left ) . </S>",
    "<S> this should not be a surprise : the data of @xcite had been compared to herwig @xcite simulations , showing near perfect agreement .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore conclude that the large excess in charged - particle production at high transverse momenta can not be explained by any modification of qcd fragmentation functions ( or of other aspects of qcd factorisation ) , because this would lead to a strong contradiction with tevatron data on charged tracks within jets in the same @xmath0 range . with @xmath0 and with centre of mass energy @xmath21 ( at fixed @xmath22 ) </S>",
    "<S> is anomalously close to the @xmath23 and @xmath24 powers that arise based from pure dimensional arguments without scaling violations . </S>",
    "<S> while we are sympathetic to such an argument , we believe that ours involves fewer theoretical assumptions . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the most likely explanation for the cdf excess , as argued already in  @xcite , is probably some issue with the data . </S>",
    "<S> but it is worth considering what the implications would be if the tracks are real .    unless somehow jets in multijet events fragment in a way so different from jets in dijet events that the plots of @xcite are not applicable in multijet qcd , then the high @xmath25 tracks in @xcite can not form part of an ordinary jet  and so , </S>",
    "<S> if the tracks are real , they can not be ordinary hadrons . nor </S>",
    "<S> can they be electrons or muons ; non - isolated electrons would appear as jets , while such high rates for muons , converted photons or isolated electrons are inconsistent with other data . </S>",
    "<S> could a new metastable exotic object be responsible for these tracks ? </S>",
    "<S> this seems unlikely but is not completely trivial to rule out .    </S>",
    "<S> whatever these objects are , they must be produced with a very large cross - section . from the last 4 bins of the data </S>",
    "<S> , one sees that it must be of order 50 nanobarns , with large errors , if the track - objects are pair produced .    </S>",
    "<S> this big cross section is a major impediment to a new physics explanation . </S>",
    "<S> a colour octet fermion with mass of 25 gev and @xmath26 would be pair produced with @xmath27 nb cross - sections at leading order . </S>",
    "<S> a wide resonance with a small branching fraction to dijets and a large branching fraction to exotica , such as a 150 gev `` coloron '' in the spirit of @xcite , could have a few - nanobarn cross - section through mixing with the gluon , and a decay dominantly to an exotic final state , while drowning in dijet background . </S>",
    "<S> still , even though a 50  nb cross - section pushes the limits of credulity , it seems worthwhile to try to exclude any exotica directly from searches for those objects .    for an object to leave a track </S>",
    "<S> , it must be ionising : it must carry electric charge or magnetic charge on an atomic scale . </S>",
    "<S> ( it could be a neutral object with a large dipole moment . ) </S>",
    "<S> in addition , to not affect the dijet fragmentation results in @xcite , it must not appear frequently in dijet events , or else must deposit only a fraction of its @xmath25 as calorimetric jet energy ( so that it appears as a small contribution at negative @xmath28 in lower dijet - mass bins ) . a possible candidate , massive metastable charged particles ( `` champs '' or `` cmsps '' ) , if colourless and stable , are excluded by cdf @xcite and d@xcite . overestimated in @xcite , but the powerful champ / cmsp bounds of @xcite still exclude it . </S>",
    "<S> any decrease in efficiency in the muon system with the lower charge would be partly countered by a decreasing tracking efficiency , requiring an even larger cross - section . ] </S>",
    "<S> even non - hadronic champs that decay in flight are excluded : given how many must leave tracks , too many would still reach the muon system and be detected by cdf s champ search . </S>",
    "<S> ( the dsearch , requiring two `` muons '' per event , is less sensitive . )    </S>",
    "<S> charged r - hadrons ( bound states of an exotic coloured object @xmath29 with quarks and gluons ) are more subtle . </S>",
    "<S> understanding of their behaviour in matter has continued to evolve ( for a review see @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> it certainly seems unlikely that a few million r - hadrons could escape the cdf champ search , but it is not simple because of charge - flipping , by which an r - hadron colliding with a nucleus may shift its charge by 1 unit . </S>",
    "<S> such flipping reduces dramatically the number of good `` muon '' candidates produced by r - hadrons , and makes the dsearch , with its requirement of two `` muons '' , one with tight isolation , far less sensitive . </S>",
    "<S> the cdf study directly considers stable top squarks , and , with some assumptions regarding their properties in matter , reports a detection efficiency greater than @xmath30 . but loopholes might remain for lower - mass r - hadrons , for example those built from a charge - neutral colour - octet @xmath29 , which is only constrained at lep @xcite to be above about 25 gev . </S>",
    "<S> ( ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite argues that indirect mass limits can be placed at 50 gev . ) and colour octets , less well understood than triplets , may well have a lower detection efficiency @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> there are good reasons to expect substantial missing transverse momentum ( met ) from r - hadrons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one is that slow r - hadrons have much less kinetic energy than @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> another is that fast r - hadrons that are neutral ( if any are produced ) are expected to deposit only a fraction of their kinetic energy in the calorimeter . in association with initial state radiation ( isr ) , a substantial met signal </S>",
    "<S> would then be generated . </S>",
    "<S> indeed in @xcite it is argued that a robust lower bound of 170 gev can be placed on gluino masses : specifically , neutral r - hadrons leave too little energy to register as jets , and therefore contribute to monojet signals @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> but r - hadron energy deposition increases at low masses , so perhaps this argument might break down for sufficiently light r - hadrons . moreover , even accepting the arguments of @xcite , r - hadrons decaying in flight with @xmath31 meters </S>",
    "<S> might still be allowed ; such decays would further reduce the sensitivity of the champ / cmsp searches . </S>",
    "<S> still , it would be necessary either that the r - hadrons appear typically in events with more than two jets , or that their decay include invisible particles , so as to evade the constraints from @xcite discussed above and not distort the jet spectrum .    </S>",
    "<S> we certainly think the r - hadron scenario unlikely . and while there may well be other allowed exotic objects that could give tracks of low curvature without producing corresponding high-@xmath25 jets , track @xcite and yet , because of unusual behaviour in matter , might not be easily detected by existing champ / cmsp searches . </S>",
    "<S> however it seems very difficult to achieve the required cross - sections . ] </S>",
    "<S> a plausible new physics scenario seems difficult to achieve . </S>",
    "<S> but because of the range of possibilities and the uncertainties on their dynamics , we can not claim to have strictly eliminated this option .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore suggest that cdf , with appropriate scepticism , might wish to exclude such possibilities directly from the data , if no technical problem with the data is immediately apparent . </S>",
    "<S> it would seem that any exotic explanation for the tracks is likely to become evident in a direct perusal of the signal events with the high-@xmath25 tracks in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> signatures could include a systematic mismatch of a track s @xmath25 with its associated energy deposition , unusual energy deposition patterns , time - of - flight delay or large @xmath32 , evidence of a late decay , overall calorimeter met , pairs of tracks per event , etc . </S>",
    "<S> ( by contrast a fake track would not lead to calorimetric met , and two such tracks per event would be very rare . note that misreconstructed tracks with unphysically high momentum are removed from the cdf champ search @xcite , though no details on this step are given . ) </S>",
    "<S> should a direct investigation of the existing events prove inconclusive , it is likely that the event sample can be enlarged by looking in other trigger streams , given the signal s high rate and apparent high energy . at a minimum </S>",
    "<S> , isr radiation should contribute events of this type to ( prescaled ) 20 or 50 gev jet triggers .    to conclude </S>",
    "<S> , we have argued that the excess of high-@xmath0 tracks seen in @xcite can not be attributed to qcd factorisation violations , or to any other misunderstanding in qcd calculations of hadron production . </S>",
    "<S> the argument is largely based on data from the tevatron itself , in the same @xmath0 range as the excess . </S>",
    "<S> we have not been able to eliminate fully the possibility that the excess is due to exotic new physics , though we view it as unlikely . </S>",
    "<S> inspection of the data should be able to settle the question . </S>"
