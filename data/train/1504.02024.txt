    "the apollo - type near - earth asteroid ( 4179 ) toutatis was originally discovered on 10 february 1934 and remained a lost asteroid until it was once again detected by c. pollas and colleagues on 4 january 1989 in caussols , france . from a dynamical viewpoint",
    ", the asteroid moves on an approximately 4:1 resonant orbit at a large eccentricity with the earth and has passed through a close encounter with the earth every four years since 1992 @xcite .",
    "dating back to the decadal years of near - earth flybys of the asteroid , the radar observations obtained from arecibo and goldstone reveal that toutatis appears to be an irregularly shaped asteroid with two distinct lobes @xcite .",
    "various types of ground - based observations indicate that toutatis is a tumbling , non - principal axis ( npa)-rotating small body @xcite .",
    "these effects , as observed in earth - approaching flybys , have also been reported based on optical observations and extensive radar measurements @xcite .",
    "the first near - earth flyby for toutatis occurred in december 1992 at a distance of 0.242 au , when the asteroid again came into view .",
    "optical observations were gathered from at least 25 sites around the world through an international campaign .",
    "the observed rotational light curves of toutatis appeared to be highly unusual , with a large amplitude and a non - periodic long rotation period .",
    "subsequently , @xcite reported two major periods of complex rotation of approximately 7.3 and 3.1 days , as estimated from analysis of the data .",
    "in addition , they reported that toutatis was the first asteroid to show strong photometric evidence of complex rotation .",
    "however , the authors did not clarify this complex rotation phenomenon .",
    "furthermore , radar observations were performed by goldstone in california and by arecibo observatory during toutatis approach in 1992 .",
    "the delay - doppler images achieved a spatial resolution of 19 meters in range and 0.15 millimeters per second in radial velocity .",
    "@xcite suggested a rotational period between 4 and 5 days based on these radar data . according to the investigations of @xcite , the damping timescale for the slow non - principal axis rotation of toutatis exceeds the age of the solar system .",
    "thus , @xcite noted that the spin state of toutatis may be primordial .",
    "however , recent investigation suggests that yorp effects may slow the spin states of asteroids .",
    "thus , toutatis spin state remains a mystery .",
    "based on these high - resolution delay - doppler radar observations , @xcite used a least - squares estimation to calculate toutatis three - dimensional shape , spin states , and moment - of - inertia ratios .",
    "they showed that the dimensions along the three principal axes are 1.92 , 2.40 and 4.60 kilometers and that toutatis rotates in a long - axis mode .",
    "the two major periods were found to be 5.41 days for the rotation about the long principal axis and 7.35 days for the long - axis precession about the angular momentum vector .",
    "the results derived from the radar data were inconsistent with the solutions presented by @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite adopted the published optical light curves @xcite and a radar - derived shape and spin - state model @xcite to estimate the hapke parameters of toutatis .",
    "the hapke photometric model was applied , and a @xmath6 minimization proposed by @xcite was performed .",
    "the synthetic light curves that were generated based on their model provided a good fit to the optical data , with an rms residual of 0.12 mag .",
    "they showed that the combination of the optical data and radar observations led to an estimation of the spin - state parameters for toutatis that was superior to the radar - derived outcomes .",
    "the two parameters describing the moment - of - inertia ratios were determined to be 3.22 and 3.02 , respectively .",
    "based on the triaxial ellipsoid shape and spin state given by @xcite , @xcite presented the results of modeling the light curve variations of this unusual rotating asteroid by numerically integrating euler s equation in combination with the explicit expression for an asteroid s brightness as a function of euler angles .",
    "they achieved good agreement between the observed and calculated light curves .",
    "they emphasized that the light curves of toutatis were dominated by the precession effect and by the superposition of precession and rotation , which resulted in an unapparent relationship between the rotation period alone and the light curves .",
    "this understanding yielded an appropriate explanation for the inconsistency between the rotational period of toutatis determined from optical data @xcite and that determined from radar observations @xcite .    during the 1996 near - earth approach ,",
    "toutatis was observed by the goldstone 8510-mhz radar system .",
    "based on the physical model derived from the observations of the 1992 approach , @xcite analyzed the radar measurements and refined the estimates of the spin state of toutatis .",
    "the combination of optical and radar data was proven to better predict the orientational sequence displayed in the images captured in 1996 .",
    "after refinement , the two periods of toutatis were updated and estimated to be @xmath7 days for the rotation about the long principal axis and @xmath8 days for the uniform precession of the long principal axis about the angular momentum vector .",
    "these two parameters yielded moment - of - inertia ratios of @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "thus , the orientation at the 2004 approach could be predicted in both inertial and geocentric coordinate systems .",
    "@xcite determined that mutual gravitational interactions between an asteroid and a planet or another asteroid can play a significant role in shaping the asteroid s spin state .",
    "they analyzed the interactions of a sphere with an arbitrary mass and with toutatis based on the radar - derived shape model .",
    "the results thus obtained could partially explain the phenomenon of toutatis current unusual rotational state .",
    "it was demonstrated that the tumbling spin state of toutatis might have been caused by near - earth flybys over its lifetime .",
    "this hypothesis enabled the estimation of the mass distribution and moment - of - inertia for toutatis @xcite , thereby allowing the likely internal structure to be inferred .    using radar observations of five flybys from 1992 to 2008",
    ", @xcite modeled the rotational dynamics and estimated toutatis spin - state parameters using the least - squares method .",
    "they calculated the euler angles , angular velocities , and moment - of - inertia ratios as well as the center - of - mass ( com)-center - of - figure ( cof ) offset . by directly relating the com - cof offset and the moment - of - inertia ratios to the spherical harmonic coefficients of the first- and second - degree gravity potential",
    ", they could determine the driving force of the external torque due to an external spherical body and evaluate the spin state .",
    "the terrestrial and solar tidal torques were considered in their dynamical models , and all aforementioned parameters were included in the variable state vector to be estimated in the study .",
    "furthermore , the spin states and uncertainties were propagated to the 2012 flyby epoch .    on 13 december 2012",
    ", the first space - borne close observation of toutatis was achieved by the second chinese lunar probe , change-2 , at a distance of @xmath11 meters from toutatis surface @xcite .",
    "optical images of the asteroid were acquired by one of the onboard engineering cameras during the outbound flyby . through analysis of over 400 images , @xcite estimated toutatis osculating orbit , its dimensions along the major axes , and its orientations .",
    "the highest resolution of the images was better than 3 meters .",
    "new discoveries were made , including the presence of a giant depression at the large end , a sharply perpendicular silhouette near the neck region , and direct evidence of boulders and regoliths .",
    "the geological features suggest that toutatis may have a rubble - pile structure .",
    "the physical length and width were determined to be @xmath12 , respectively , and the direction of the @xmath13 axis was calculated to be ( 234.1@xmath14 , 60.7@xmath14 ) .",
    "they showed that the bifurcated configuration may indicate that toutatis is of contact binary origin and that it is composed of two major lobes ( head and body ) .    in this work ,",
    "we perform an extensive investigation of the optical images of toutatis captured by change-2 , and we determine the orientation of the asteroid at the flyby epoch . in combination with radar observations ( @xcite and references therein ) , we estimate the rotational parameters of toutatis . moreover , the solar and terrestrial tidal torques are considered in the establishment of the rotational dynamics model .",
    "the torque due to the misalignment of the center of mass and the origin of the body - fixed frame is evaluated to be insignificant at first order @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we incorporate the external gravitational tidal effects from the moon and jupiter in our dynamical model .    compared with the previous prediction @xcite , our results for toutatis orientation , derived for change-2 s flyby epoch from both radar data and optical images , demonstrate good consistency with the observational results of the spacecraft @xcite .",
    "our simulations reproduce the trajectory of the long axis in space , with a precession amplitude of approximately @xmath15 .",
    "this high amplitude of toutatis precession is supportive of its tumbling attitude as observed from earth .",
    "the characteristics of the angular momentum variations is investigated in detail , and the variation induced by the near - earth flyby in 2004 is estimated to be @xmath16 .",
    "the orientation of its angular momentum in space is found to be described by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , and therefore , this orientation has remained nearly constant over the past two decades .",
    "the rotational periods are estimated from the simulations to be 5.38 and 7.40 days for the rotation and precession , respectively .",
    "these values are in good agreement with the work of @xcite .",
    "this work is structured as follows : section 2 presents the observational data , which comprise ground - based measurements and optical images acquired by change-2 . in this section",
    ", we also analyze the optical data to derive the orientation of toutatis at the flyby epoch . in section 3 ,",
    "we model the rotational dynamics of toutatis based on euler s equation .",
    "the least - squares and multiple shooting methods are employed to fit the variable state vector and the corresponding results .",
    "the simulation results are presented in section 4 . finally , we conclude by discussing the innovations of our investigation compared with previous works .",
    "as described above , toutatis progrades on an approximately 4:1 resonant eccentric trajectory with the earth .",
    "orbital determination and rotational parameters for toutatis have been documented since the asteroid began to be continually observed in 1992 . since that time",
    ", ground - based observations have been performed for its every near - miss of earth . as is well known , on 13 dec 2012",
    ", change-2 completed the first successful close flyby of toutatis and acquired numerous images of this asteroid @xcite .    using the released data from the minor planet center and hundreds of optical observations from the ground - based observational campaign that lasted from july to december of 2012 ,",
    "the orbital determination of toutatis was precisely achieved within uncertainties on the order of several kilometers , and the orbital parameters at the flyby epoch were calculated to be @xmath17=2.5336 au , @xmath18=0.6301 , @xmath19=0.4466@xmath14 , @xmath20=124.3991@xmath14 , @xmath21=278.6910@xmath14 and @xmath22=6.7634@xmath14 .",
    "hence , the initial orbit can be integrated to calculate the relative positions of toutatis with respect to the sun , earth , moon and other major planets in the solar system , which are required for computing the external torques from the solar tides , the terrestrial tides and the gravitational tides from other bodies",
    ".    the positions of the major planets and the moon are calculated based on the de405 ephemerides released by jpl .",
    "the gravitation of the sun , the major planets and 67 asteroids in the main belt as well as post - newtonian effects are considered in the dynamical model to achieve the orbital integration of toutatis . in addition , chebyshev polynomial fitting is numerically implemented to obtain the position of the asteroid at any given epoch .",
    "radar measurements of toutatis acquired by goldstone and arecibo from 1992 to 2008 are used to solve for the asteroid s rotational parameters .",
    "@xcite presented 33 sets of radar observations . together with the orientation obtained by change-2 at the flyby epoch ( see section 2.2 ) , we have 33 sets of ground - based observation outcomes , including euler angles , angular velocities and one space - borne orientation parameter .",
    "the observational data are summarized in table 1 .",
    "the observational errors of the radar data are estimated to be between @xmath23 and @xmath24 @xcite for the euler angles and between 2@xmath25 day@xmath26 and 10@xmath25 day@xmath26 for the components of angular velocity ; these errors are taken into account in our fitting .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the residuals of the euler angles ( 34 sets ) and angular velocity ( 33 sets ) were normalized with respect to the maximum radar observational errors ( @xmath24 for the euler angles and @xmath27/day for the angular velocities ) and are shown in figure 6 . because the previous prediction of the orientation at the change-2 flyby epoch based on the radar - derived results differs from that observed by change-2 , the use of the optical data might have degraded the convergence of the simulation algorithm .",
    "therefore , the magnitude of the residuals is larger than that observed in the results from the radar data ( takahashi et al , 2013 ) .",
    "the residual errors in the simulations were normalized with respect to the observational uncertainties . because of the inconsistency of the observational data , the magnitudes of the residuals are slightly higher than those of the previous results .",
    "however , all deviations lie within the @xmath28 region .",
    "the largest bias is found in the roll angle , which exhibits a remarkable difference between the prediction obtained from the radar measurements and the authentic spin state of toutatis that is directly indicated by change-2 s observations at the flyby epoch .          according to the numerical results derived from radar observations collected before 2008 @xcite",
    ", we considered a render effect for toutatis and generated a predicted imaging outcome prior to change-2 s flyby , as shown in figure 7a @xcite .",
    "in addition , based on the images acquired by change-2 , we corrected the attitude of toutatis by rotating the radar - derived shape model ( see section 2.2.1 ) to search for a good match with the change-2 images acquired at the flyby epoch ( fig .",
    "7b ) , which provide the only space - borne optical data regarding toutatis orientation .",
    "furthermore , the present simulations yielded another solution for toutatis attitude during the near - earth flyby in 2012 .",
    "figure 7c shows the outcomes derived from our rotational model using space- and ground - based observations .    in comparison with the results obtained from the optical images ( fig .",
    "7b ) , the radar - derived results ( fig .",
    "7a ) exhibit a dramatic deviation in the roll angle ; hence , these results yield a different profile of the asteroid .",
    "the simulation results derived from our dynamical model ( fig .",
    "7c ) differ from those of figure 7b with a pitch angle bias of within @xmath29 .",
    "thus , we may safely conclude that our outcomes represent a good improvement in the understanding of toutatis spin state .",
    "the orientation of the long axis in the inertial frame likely reflects the precession of toutatis .",
    "based on the dynamical model of rotation , we calculated the variation in the direction of the long axis .",
    "figure 8 shows the trajectories of the long axis with respect to the j2000 ecliptic coordinate system in a unit sphere over the past two decades .",
    "the motions of the long axis are projected onto the x - y , x - z and y - z planes ( see figs .",
    "8a , 8b and 8c , respectively ) .",
    "the figure reveals that the long - axis motion of the asteroid has remained ellipsoidal in the x - y and y - z planes , whereas it has rectilinearly precessed in the x - z plane .",
    "all curves lie outside the ecliptic plane , implying that the small lobe of toutatis is always located above the large end from a viewpoint close to the ecliptic .    moreover , the orientation of the center axis of precession of toutatis can be approximately determined from figure 8 , and the derived spherical coordinates can be estimated to be @xmath30 in the ecliptic coordinate system . as a result of toutatis clockwise",
    "rotation and precession , the center axis of precession points nearly along the opposite direction to the angular momentum ( see section 4.3 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the precession is approximately @xmath15 , which may shed light on the significantly different attitudes of the asteroid that have been observed from earth .",
    "considering the radar - derived shape model and the components of the inertial matrix inferred by @xcite , we will now explore the angular momentum of toutatis induced by various external gravitational torques .",
    "figure 9 shows the variations in the external gravitational torques acting on the spin state of toutatis from 1992 to 2012 .",
    "the solar torque is on the order of @xmath31 , indicating that its value is 2 - 3 orders higher at the perigee than at the apogee .",
    "its periodic variation is clearly associated with toutatis orbital period .",
    "the variation tendencies of the gravitational torques arising from the earth and moon are similar , as shown by the red and blue curves , respectively .",
    "there is a @xmath32 difference in the orders of these torques because of the magnitudes of the masses of the bodies from which they arise .",
    "the periods of both torques are consistent with that of the black curve because of toutatis resonance orbit with the earth . at present , toutatis is also in a 3:1 mean motion resonance orbit with jupiter @xcite ; thus , one entire period of the torque induced by jupiter is displayed by the green curve @xcite .",
    "based on the rotational dynamical equation and the integrated orbit , the overall influence of these external torques on the variation in the magnitude of toutatis rotational angular momentum from 1992 to 2012 was normalized with respect to the initial magnitude @xmath33 @xcite , as shown in figure 10a .",
    "the terrestrial tidal torque ( see the red curve in fig .",
    "10b ) causes a considerable change in angular momentum when the asteroid approaches earth at the perihelion or during the earth flyby that occurs every four years . the most significant change , with a variation in angular momentum magnitude on the order of 0.03% , occurred in 2004 as a result of toutatis passing the earth within 4.02 lunar distances .",
    "similarly , the tendency of the effect of the lunar torque is consistent with that of the terrestrial torque , as shown in figure 10c .",
    "the solar tides always have a predominant influence on the rotational variation .",
    "however , the terrestrial tides also play an important role in the variation in angular momentum during toutatis regular nearby visits to earth .",
    "figure 10d shows the influence on the angular momentum exerted by jupiter .",
    "the order of magnitude of this effect slightly changed after the 2004 near - earth flyby , and the amplitude continually remains lower than that of the terrestrial torque .",
    "as our simulation results indicate , the angular momentum orientation of toutatis is determined to be described by ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 ) and has remained nearly unchanged in space over the past two decades .",
    "figure 11 shows the variations in toutatis angular momentum orientation from 1992 to 2012 in the j2000 ecliptic frame .",
    "the amplitude of this change is shown to be less than one degree in both longitude and latitude .",
    "jumps in the angular momentum orientation occur at the perihelion of each orbit .",
    "a small change in behavior is evident in figure 11b as a result of the 2004 near - earth flyby , consistent with figure 10b .",
    "the variation with solar distance that is apparent in figure 11c and 11d indicates that the solar and terrestrial torques predominantly affect the rotational motion of the asteroid .",
    "the misalignment of the curves in figure 11d is also a result of the 2004 near - earth flyby .",
    "figure 11e and 11f show the angular momentum orientations of 33 sets of radar observations .",
    "compared with the numerical results , the observation data fall within a reasonable error range , with the exception of a few points at large bias .",
    "the motions of the short or middle axis reflect the status of the rotation about the long axis , whereas the long axis motion represents precession . to calculate the two periods associated with the spin states of toutatis",
    ", we determined the latitudinal variations of the asteroid s long and middle axes in the j2000 ecliptic frame , as shown in figure 12 .",
    "we applied fourier transform to analyze the periods of the two oscillation parameters and found that they are 5.38 days for the rotation about the principal axis and 7.40 days for the precession of the principal axis .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the previous results @xcite .",
    "let @xmath34 and @xmath35 indicate the latitudes of the asteroid s long and middle axes , respectively , in the j2000 ecliptic coordinate system .",
    "figures 12 and 13 show the latitudinal variations of these axes during the 1992 and 1996 flybys , respectively . additionally , the numerical results ( represented by dotted lines in figs . 12 and 13 ) that were calculated from our dynamical model are found to be in good agreement with the radar observations within the error bars ( marked by stars ) @xcite , as listed in table 4 .",
    "hence , we may conclude that the orientation parameters of toutatis obtained from our investigation are very reliable .",
    "this evidence provides further confirmation that our proposed rotational model can be used to correctly evaluate the spin status of toutatis or other asteroids .",
    "in this work , we apply the observations collected during change-2 s outbound flyby to model the rotational dynamics and determine the spin state of toutatis . based on flyby images , we utilize the radar - derived shape model to calculate toutatis orientation at the flyby epoch . in addition , we estimate the 3 - 1 - 3 euler angles to be @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "consequently , our results have greatly improved the estimation of the orientational parameters of toutatis with respect to the previous predictions .    in combination with ground - based observations , we investigated the evolution of the spin parameters using numerical simulations .",
    "in addition to the solar and terrestrial torques , the tidal effects arising from the moon and jupiter are extensively considered in our dynamical model .",
    "the magnitude and influence of these gravitational torques were analyzed in this work .",
    "the solar tide appears to always be the dominant torque acting on the angular momentum of toutatis .",
    "furthermore , the contribution to the external gravitation torque due to the com - cof offset appears to be negligible in the first - order approximation .",
    "we also found that the closest near - earth flyby , at 4.02 lunar distances , resulted in a 0.03% change in the magnitude of the angular momentum of toutatis . the dynamical influence exerted by saturn on the angular momentum",
    "was also assessed in further simulations and found to be approximately @xmath36 lower than that of jupiter .",
    "hence , we can safely conclude that saturn plays a less important role in the variation of toutatis angular momentum .",
    "the attitude at the change-2 flyby epoch that was derived from the numerical simulations yielded a better approximation to the optical results than that previously obtained from radar data alone .",
    "the largest deviation in the euler angles is observed in the pitch angle , with a bias of less than @xmath29 .",
    "the uncertainties corresponding to observational uncertainties and data processing error were considered in the simulations .",
    "the inconsistency in the different types of observational data may have led to higher residuals compared with previous results .",
    "simulations based solely on radar observations were also performed , and the corresponding rms magnitude was much lower .",
    "however , the results obtained using a higher - accuracy dynamical model and a combination of the various types of observations yielded a good result that is highly consistent with the optical images acquired during the change-2 flyby in 2012 .",
    "the precession of toutatis was investigated by considering the motion of its long axis .",
    "the behavior of the orbit in the inertial frame was found to be circular , with a center axis pointing along ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the precession amplitude was estimated to be up to @xmath38 , which may be responsible for the significantly different attitude of the asteroid as observed by ground - based facilities . moreover , by exploring the motions of the long axis and middle axis , we determined the rotation period of toutatis using fourier analysis .",
    "the two major periods were found to be 5.38 days for the principal axis rotation and 7.40 days for the precession , in agreement with the results reported by @xcite .",
    "toutatis angular momentum orientation was determined to be described by @xmath4 and @xmath5 , indicating that it has remained nearly unchanged for the last two decades .",
    "because of the increasing magnitudes of the solar and terrestrial torques , tiny jumps in the angular momentum orientation occur at perihelion in each orbital period . however , the dynamical effects caused by the near - earth flyby in 2004 slightly changed the latitude of toutatis angular momentum orientation .",
    "hence , our simulation results are in good agreement with previous radar observations . in a word , based on the combination of change-2 s observations and radar data",
    ", our investigation offers an improved understanding of the rotational dynamics of toutatis .",
