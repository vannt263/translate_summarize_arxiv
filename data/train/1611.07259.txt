    "<S> neutrino - electron scattering is a purely leptonic fundamental interaction and therefore provides an important channel to test standard model ( sm ) especially at the low energy - momentum transfer regime . </S>",
    "<S> we derived constraints on neutrino non - stardard - interactions ( nsi ) couplings depending on model independent approaches which are described by a four - fermi point like interaction and unparticle physics model with tensorial components . </S>",
    "<S> data on @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering from the texono and lsnd experiments , respectively , are used . </S>",
    "<S> the upper limits and the allowed regions of scalar , pseudoscalar and tensorial nsi couplings of neutrinos are derived at 90% confidence level in both one - parameter and two - parameter analysis . </S>",
    "<S> new upper limits for tensorial unparticle physics coupling constants and mass parameters are also placed . </S>"
