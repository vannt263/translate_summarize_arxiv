    "amongst the chalcogenide glasses , glassy germanium disulfide ( g - ges@xmath0 ) has been heavily studied for many years @xcite and is still the subject of recent experimental investigations @xcite because of its interesting physical properties .",
    "chalcogenide materials can be used as sensitive media for optical recording , as light guides , as high - resolution inorganic photoresistors or anti reflection coatings@xcite .",
    "moreover bulk glasses with for example ag@xmath2 cations are good solid electrolytes with a high ionic conductivity at room temperature @xcite and thin ges@xmath0 films are promising materials for submicron lithography when doped with silver @xcite .",
    "the high quantum efficiency of these glasses appears as a consequence of the relative high masses of the elements involved @xcite .",
    "all these potential applications of glassy ges@xmath0 have led many authors to study the physical properties of these chalcogenide glasses and many experiments have been done on this topic @xcite . however in order to understand the physical mechanisms occurring at the atomic scale and leading to the results observed in experiments , numerical simulations can be an alternative tool and more specifically molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "although cluster modeling simulations were performed on g - ges@xmath0 @xcite , it appears that ges@xmath0 compounds have not been the topic of extensive md investigations yet , contrary to gese@xmath0 @xcite or sise@xmath0 @xcite . in order to perform",
    "such investigations one has to decide what kind of description ( classical or _",
    "ab initio _ ) is adequate for ges@xmath0 . taking the mostly ( but not purely ) covalent bonding into account in g - ges@xmath0 a first - principles approach seems appropriate . in this paper",
    "we present therefore a theoretical study of the structural , dynamical and electronic properties of g - ges@xmath0 using an approximate _ ab initio _ description based on the sankey - niklewski scheme @xcite and materialized in the so - called `` fireball96 '' md code @xcite .",
    "this technique has been successfully used in the study of several different chalcogenide glasses @xcite and in order to check its validity in the case of ges@xmath0 samples we have compared our results with experimental results when those were available . concerning the structure at 300k , the nearest - neighbor distances as well as the static structure factor compare well with the experimental data . using the angle distributions and the radial pair distribution functions we find the correct proportion of edge and corner sharing ges@xmath1 tetrahedra which are the basic building blocks of the germanium disulfide glass . concerning the dynamics of the individual particles , we find in the mean square displacement ( msd ) signatures of individual or collective atomic rearrangements corresponding to either the removal of `` defects '' or to the oscillation of large clusters which could be at the origin of the excess of modes seen at low frequency in the vibrational spectrum .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we present the theoretical foundation of the fireball96 code as well as the approximations used . in section iii the results are presented for the structural , dynamical and electronic properties of the ges@xmath0 sample and section iv gives the major conclusions .",
    "the theoretical framework of our work is the widely used density functional theory ( dft ) @xcite using _ three _ additional approximations .",
    "+ first , we use the well known local density approximation ( lda ) @xcite combined with the pseudopotential approximation , which replaces the core electrons by an effective potential acting on the valence electrons ( hamman - schluter - chiang pseudopotentials are used @xcite ) .",
    "the electronic eigenstates are determined by a tight - binding - like linear combination of pseudo atomic orbitals ( pao s ) that satisfy the atomic self - consistent hohenberg - kohn - sham equations @xcite . a minimal basis set of one _ s _ and three _ p _ confined pseudo - orbitals per site is required .",
    "+ the second approximation has been suggested by harris @xcite .",
    "it consists in using a sum of neutral - atom spherical charge densities as a 0@xmath3-order approximation to the self - consistent density , keeping only the first - order changes from this density in the energy functional .",
    "this approximation avoids the necessity of iterating to self - consistency , so eigenvalues only need to be determined once instead of @xmath410 times at each step .",
    "this approximation also avoids four - center coulomb integrals in our calculations , which is a great simplification .",
    "the harris functional has been used in many studies and has always given surprisingly good agreement with fully self - consistent calculations , except for highly ionic systems@xcite . + a third approximation is made to reduce the range of the tight - binding - like hamiltonian matrix elements . to that purpose , the pao s are slightly excited by imposing the boundary condition that they vanish outside a predetermined radius .",
    "this cut - off radius is chosen equal to @xmath5 , which represents a distance of 2.645  .",
    "atoms do not overlap each other beyond twice this distance , so the number of neighbors of each atom is considerably reduced .",
    "+ all these approximations permit to gain a considerable amount of cpu time compared to _ ab initio _ methods like the car - parrinello scheme @xcite and therefore one can perform longer simulation runs or study larger systems .",
    "moreover this method has proved to be a very efficient tool for a wide variety of problems , and has been used with success in many different investigations @xcite .",
    "+ concerning the details of the present simulation , all of our calculations were performed in the microcanonical ensemble ( n , v , e = constant ) , with a time step of 2.5 fs , and using only the @xmath6 point to sample the brillouin zone .",
    "the initial configuration of our system was a crystalline @xmath7-ges@xmath0 sample containing 96 particles ( 32 ge and 64 s ) confined in a cubic cell of 13.82   to which periodic boundary conditions have been applied .",
    "this represents a density of 2.75 g.@xmath8 , which is the usual experimental density @xcite .",
    "this crystalline configuration was then melted at 2000 k over approximately 2 ps and then equilibrated at 1000 k for an additional 1.5 ps .",
    "we then quenched the system ( by velocity rescaling ) through the glass transition ( t@xmath9=710 k ) to a target temperature of t=300k over 4ps ( for more details on similar systems , see @xcite ) .",
    "starting from this configuration , we performed a very long thermal md simulation at 300 k over 375 ps _",
    "i.e. _ 150000 steps . during this time",
    ", we saved the configurations every 20 steps and consequently all the results presented below have been averaged over these 7500 configurations .",
    "the basic building blocks of glassy g - ges@xmath0 are ges@xmath1 tetrahedra , connected together within a random network .",
    "the structural unit disorder is reflected in the absence of long range order and in the wide distribution of bond lengths and bond angles .",
    "structural information may be extracted from the radial pair correlation function @xmath10 . for a given @xmath11 pair it is defined by : @xmath12 results",
    "are shown in fig .  1 for the three different pairs",
    ". the smallest distance appears for the ge - s pairs ( fig .",
    "1(b ) ) at 2.22   , and is in perfect agreement with the distance determined experimentally ( 2.21  @xcite ) .",
    "the distance between two ge atoms represents the intertetrahedral distance , and depends on the nature of the connection between the tetrahedra .",
    "the first peak at 2.91    in fig .",
    "1(a ) is due to edge - sharing tetrahedra , while the second one , at 3.41   , is due to corner - sharing links as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the experimental distances are respectively estimated at 2.91    and 3.42    @xcite , which is extremely close to our results .",
    "finally the s - s pairs are responsible of the wide peak centered at 3.66    ( fig .",
    "1(c ) ) , which is also extremely close to the experimental first s - s distance of 3.64    @xcite . +",
    "a complementary way to analyze the structure is to compute the static structure factor @xmath13 ( obtained by fourier transformation of @xmath10 ) which can be directly compared to its experimental counterpart . in fig .",
    "3 we present the calculated @xmath13 together with the one obtained by neutron diffraction experiments @xcite .",
    "the good agreement between the two curves shows the quality of the model concerning the structural description of ges@xmath0 glasses .",
    "the first sharp diffraction peak ( fsdp ) , which is a signature of the intermediate range order in amorphous states , appears at @xmath41  @xmath14 and is slightly underestimated compared to the experimental one .",
    "this is probably a consequence of the small size of our system : 1  @xmath14 represents in real space a distance of 6.3    and a sphere with such a radius provides a volume which is close to the total volume of our cell .",
    "therefore the lack of statistics for these large distances can explain the underestimation of the fsdp in our simulation .",
    "+ in order to analyze completely the medium - range structure we have also calculated the bond angle distributions and in particular the intratetrahedral @xmath15 and intertetrahedral @xmath16 bond angles which are represented in fig .",
    "the intratetrahedral angle @xmath15 is centered at 110@xmath17 , which is close to the perfect tetrahedral angle of 109.47@xmath17 .",
    "its large distribution is a signature of the structural disorder of our glassy sample .",
    "the intertetrahedral bond angle @xmath16 is the angle _ between _ tetrahedra and includes two major contributions . the first one , centered at 80@xmath17 , is caused by edge - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "the second , at @xmath4100@xmath17 , is due to corner - sharing tetrahedra .",
    "the integration of these two peaks permits to estimate the fraction of edge - sharing and corner - sharing connections which are respectively 18.6@xmath18 and 81.4@xmath18 .",
    "these results have also been confirmed by a direct counting of each type of connection in our sample .",
    "experimental raman scattering measurements in amorphous g - ges@xmath0 have given 16.6@xmath18 of edge - sharing links and 83.4@xmath18 of corner - sharing links @xcite which is relatively close to our results .",
    "+ in view of all these data , we can safely say that the model describes correctly the structure of amorphous ges@xmath0 .",
    "it remains to be seen if this is also true for the dynamical properties which is the topic of the next section .",
    "the dynamical properties of glassy g - ges@xmath0 have been studied through the mean square displacement ( msd ) and the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) .",
    "the msd is defined as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the position of particle @xmath21 at time @xmath22 .",
    "we can deduce from the slope of the msd the diffusion constant @xmath23 , where @xmath24 . in our calculation",
    ", @xmath23 was found equal to zero ; this means that the thermal energy at ambient temperature is not high enough to reach the diffusive regime during the time scale of our simulation ( 375 ps ) . nevertheless during this time",
    "some specific structural rearrangements can occur which manifest themselves by a brutal increase of the total msd or of the msd of individual atoms . in this later case",
    "the `` jumps '' in the msd are due to the removal of a coordination `` defect '' in the glassy system .",
    "an example of such a rearrangement is shown in fig .  5 : fig .",
    "5(a ) represents the individual msd of ge@xmath25 , a particular germanium atom , with a brutal increase from @xmath4  0.5  @xmath26 ( before the jump ) to @xmath4  2.5  @xmath26 ( after the jump ) around 100  ps .",
    "the jump can clearly be seen in fig .",
    "5(b ) which shows the projection of the displacement of ge@xmath25 on the x - z plane while the reason of the jump becomes apparent in fig .",
    "5(c ) and 5(d ) which illustrates the group of particles surrounding ge@xmath25 just before and after the jump .",
    "indeed we see that the initially 3-coordinated ge@xmath25 atom gets linked with a terminal sulfur atom creating thus 2 edge - sharing tetrahedra which is a configuration energetically more favorable . + the second kind of rearrangement illustrated in fig .",
    "6 involves a larger number of particles and manifests itself by a `` pulse '' in the total msd whose amplitude is more important for the sulfur atoms than for the germanium atoms as shown in fig .",
    "6(a ) . in that case",
    "a group of particles ( @xmath4  20 ) in a certain configuration at @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "6(b ) ) switches to a new state at @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "6(c ) ) which can be called metastable since its life time is relatively short ( @xmath4  10  ps ) before the system comes back again to its original structure .",
    "note that in this case no link has been broken or created .",
    "we observed such `` oscillations '' twice in our simulation with a time interval of 300  ps .",
    "clearly our simulation time is too short to see if these oscillations repeat themselves at a well determined ( low ) frequency and to make a connection with the so - called `` soft''-modes @xcite well known in amorphous systems .",
    "+ to complete the study of the dynamical properties we have computed @xmath29 , the vibrational density of states ( vdos ) , via a fourier transformation of the velocity autocorrelation function : @xmath30    the fourier transformation has been calculated using the wiener - kinchin theorem @xcite over the last 4096 steps of the simulation .",
    "the total spectrum as well as the partial contributions due to ge and s are shown in fig .",
    "7 . despite serious efforts we could not find the experimental counterpart of the total spectrum since apparently no neutron diffraction studies have been performed on g - ges@xmath0 . but comparing our results with those obtained for the analogous gese@xmath0 glasses @xcite the spectrum exhibits the same features .",
    "mainly two bands can be distinguished : a low - energy acoustic band involving mainly extended interblock vibrations and a high - energy optic band consisting of more localized intrablock vibrations .",
    "the two main bands are clearly separated and have approximately the same width ( 7  thz ) .",
    "in addition to the usual acoustic and optical bands , a small band can be seen close to 8  thz corresponding to the so - called a@xmath31 mode @xcite .",
    "the a@xmath31 mode is well known to be a tetrahedral breathing mode ( in which a central ge atom is stationary and its four s neighbors move radially relative to the fixed ge ) .",
    "this feature is strongly revealed in raman measurements@xcite , because the mode is especially raman active . in raman measurements",
    ", there is a clear indication of a  two peak \" structure to the a@xmath31 band . in particular",
    ", one usually sees a high frequency peak or shoulder which is interpreted as arising from edge - sharing tetrahedra ( see fig .",
    "2 ) , and the main band from tetrahedra in corner - sharing conformations@xcite .",
    "the @xmath32 and @xmath33 modes have also been resolved in inelastic neutron scattering studies of g - gese@xmath0@xcite . in our work",
    "the tetrahedral breathing band does show a clearly resolved splitting .",
    "it is possible that a direct analysis of the eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix@xcite would provide more information linking the observed spectral feature to microscopic vibrational excitations . at the low frequency end of the spectrum ,",
    "a shoulder is present between 1 and 2  thz which is coherent with the existence of a `` boson '' peak found experimentally @xcite .",
    "the `` boson '' peak refers to an excess in the vdos with respect to the debye distribution and is located generally around 1.5thz .      in fig .",
    "8 we present the electronic density of states ( edos ) , obtained by binning the density functional electron energy eigenvalues from the starting , fully relaxed model .",
    "the @xmath6 point optical gap is 3.27  ev which compares very well with the experimental value of 3.2  ev obtained by resonant raman - scattering spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "this good agreement is due to the opposite effects of the use of a minimal basis set which is well known to exaggerate the gap and of kohn - sham eigenvalues which tend to underestimate the gap .",
    "it should be noted that this gap is greater than that ( 2.3  ev ) of g - gese@xmath0 .",
    "another point from fig .",
    "8 is the lack of any localized states in the optical gap ( the fermi level is at @xmath34 in our calculation ) .",
    "this lack of gap states is realistic , since the density of gap states is very small in g - ges@xmath0 .",
    "we find that the results obtained for our 96-atom ges@xmath0 model are in excellent agreement with all the corresponding experimental results that are available .",
    "this realism is surprising since the size of our system is relatively small , and accurate md simulations usually require larger systems . + the structural properties of g - ges@xmath0 , which have been extensively studied , are all extremely realistic in our simulation .",
    "the pair - correlation functions lead to interatomic distances that are within @xmath35  compared to the experimental values and the static structure factor is very similar to the one obtained from neutron diffraction studies .",
    "the small underestimation of the fsdp encourages us to use larger models and we are currently preparing samples containing 258 atoms . the fraction of edge and corner - sharing tetrahedra , which can be deduced from the angular distribution , is also close to experiment .",
    "it should be mentioned that we do nt find homopolar ( ge - ge or s - s ) bonds in the present investigation but their existence can not be excluded _ a priori _ in the 258-atom model .",
    "probably a more in - depth study of the large system will permit to solve the apparent disagreement between two recent experimental studies on this point @xcite .",
    "+ concerning the dynamical properties of our sample we find discontinuous atomic displacements at ambient temperature , leading to jumps in the msd .",
    "these jumps can either be due to the removal of coordination defects around a single atom or to oscillations of larger groups of atoms ( @xmath4 20 ) between a stable and metastable configuration which could be at the origin of `` soft''-modes that are often seen in amorphous systems .",
    "the vibrational density of states of glassy ges@xmath0 could not be compared directly to the experimental spectrum since to our knowledge it is not available in the literature yet .",
    "we find basically two bands separated by a `` gap '' in which exists a small structure due to the tetrahedral breathing modes . at low frequency",
    "we find at around 1  thz a shoulder corresponding to the famous boson peak present in many amorphous systems . concerning the electronic properties we find an optical gap of 3.27 ev and no localized states in the gap which is in agreement with experimental data .",
    "+ these first md results obtained for g - ge@xmath0 with the use of the fireball96 code show that one can have confidence in this `` pseudo '' _ ab initio _ scheme giving an excellent description of the physical characteristics of germanium disulfide for a relatively low computer load . + * acknowledgments : * pj would like to thank r. jullien , a. pradel and m. ribes for their help in initiating this project .",
    "we would like to thank also e. bychkov for the data of the experimental structure factor of g - ges@xmath0 as well as jun li for advice in the early stages of this work .",
