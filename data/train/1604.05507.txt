    "the gravitational potential influences the rate at which time passes .",
    "this means that a hypothetical measurement of the age of a massive object like the sun or the earth would yield different results depending on whether performed at the surface or near the center . in this connection ,",
    "clearly , issues such as the initial assembly of cosmic dust to form the protoplanet eventually leading to the earth is not what is alluded to when considering the age .",
    "rather , the age is understood as e.g.  the aging of radioactive elements in the earth , i.e.  that fewer radioactive decays of a particular specimen have taken place in the earth center than on its surface .",
    "furthermore , arguments based on symmetry will convince most skeptics , including those from the general public , that there is no gravitational force at the earth center .",
    "consequently , such an effect can not be due to the force itself , but may instead be due to the accumulated action of gravity ( a layman expression for the gravitational potential energy being the radial integral of the force ) .",
    "thus , there is also a good deal of pedagogical value in this observation .    in a series of lectures presented at caltech in 1962 - 63 ,",
    "feynman is reported to have shared this fascinating insight with the audience using the formulation `` ... since the center of the earth should be a day or two younger than the surface ! ''",
    "this thought experiment is just one among a plethora of fascinating observations about the physical world provided by richard feynman .",
    "although this time difference has been quoted in a few papers , either the lecturer or the transcribers had it wrong ; it should have been given as years instead of days.    in this paper , we first present a simple back - of - the - envelope calculation which compares to what may have been given in the lecture series .",
    "we then present a more elaborate analysis which brings along a number of instructive points .",
    "we believe that this correction only makes the observation of age difference due to gravity even more intriguing .    we stress that this paper is by no means an attempt at besmearing the reputation of neither feynman nor any of the authors who trustingly replicated his statement ( including one of the authors of the present paper , uiu ) .",
    "instead the , admittedly small , mistake is used as a pedagogical point much like the example the human failings of genius that ohanian has used in his book about einstein s mistakes @xcite . realising that even geniuses make mistakes may make the scientist more inclined towards critically examining any postulate on his / her own .",
    "we initially suppose that the object under consideration is a sphere with radius @xmath0 and mass @xmath1 , homogeneously distributed .",
    "its gravitational potential as a function of distance @xmath2 to its center is then given by @xmath3 such that the potential on its surface is @xmath4 and the potential in its center is @xmath5 .",
    "the difference between the gravitational potential at the center and at the surface is then @xmath6 a difference in gravitational potential implies a time dilation at the point with the lower potential .",
    "this is given by the standard gravitational redshift @xmath7 which here relates the ( angular ) frequencies at the center , @xmath8 , and at the surface @xmath9 .",
    "being the inverse of the period , the frequency is indirectly a measure of how quickly time passes .",
    "it is customary to use the symbol @xmath8 in this connection , and we emphasise that this variable has nothing to do with the earth rotation .",
    "we combine equation with the result for @xmath10 in equation and use that @xmath11 , @xmath12 we note that this treatment is based on equation which `` ... refers only to identically constructed clocks located at different distances from the center of mass of a gravitating body along the lines of force .",
    "all that is required is that the clocks obey the weak equivalence principle [ ... ] and the special theory of relativity . ''",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent , instructive example that can be easily performed in the undergraduate laboratory to display one aspect of the equivalence principle .    for the case of the earth , upon rewriting and setting the surface acceleration @xmath13 m / s@xmath14 , with @xmath15 being the earth radius , equation becomes @xmath16 such that the earth mass @xmath17 and the gravitational constant @xmath18 are not needed explicitly .",
    "for the sake of a back - of - the - envelope calculation we may exploit that @xmath19 year ( within 3% , although there is no direct connection between the motion of the earth around the sun and @xmath20 ) . the earth age is @xmath21 years and its average radius is @xmath22 6371 km so that @xmath23 is approximately 10 ms .",
    "a year is approximately @xmath24 s. clearly , the use here of @xmath25 is a mnemonic device , not an expression of precision , although it is precise to about half a percent ( one could use @xmath26 instead of @xmath25 which , however , is imprecise to 5 percent ) .",
    "thus the difference between the age of the earth surface and its center becomes approximately @xmath27 years , with the center being youngest .",
    "this is the _ type _ of back - of - the - envelope calculation that one could imagine that feynman had in mind when he expressed his `` ... since the center of the earth should be a day [ which thus should have read year ] or two younger than the surface ! ''",
    "where the mistake actually entered in the lecture and transcription process is unlikely to ever be ascertained , and its exact origin is not important for the following discussion .    with tabulated values for @xmath28 and @xmath29 a more precise number for the homogeneous earth is obtained : @xmath30 with the center being youngest .      rather than assuming a homogeneous earth",
    ", we now turn to a more realistic density distribution .",
    "this yields a significantly different result and reveals some insights to the origin of the time difference . a rather precise description , but not the only one available , of the earth density profile is tabulated in the so - called preliminary reference earth model ( prem )  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the prem has been applied to give a detailed description of the earth gravity tunnel problem @xcite .",
    "we shall consider a spherically symmetric earth with a density only dependent on radius , @xmath31 , as given by the prem , see figure [ fig : density ] .",
    ".,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the gravitational potential caused by this sphere is then given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the mass specific force , or acceleration @xmath34 , due to gravity , with @xmath35 being the gravitational force ( which is why @xmath36 is the gravitational potential and not the gravitational potential _ energy _ ) .",
    "the gravitational potential energy is equal to the work done by taking a test particle of mass @xmath37 from infinity to a distance @xmath2 away from the center of the earth .",
    "we split the expression in two parts : @xmath38 with the first term being the work per unit mass done inside the object - in this case the earth - and the last term the work per unit mass done moving the test particle from infinity to the earth surface .",
    "the gravitational acceleration at a distance , @xmath2 , outside a sphere of mass @xmath1 is @xmath39 , the sign showing that it is directed towards the center . inside the sphere ,",
    "when @xmath40 , only the mass closer than @xmath2 to the center matters .",
    "we denote this by @xmath41 now we can write the sum specifically for @xmath40 as @xmath42 where the last term is the potential at the surface of the object .",
    "the integrand in the first term is the gravitational acceleration as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "when evaluated at the surface , @xmath43 , the result is the normal gravitational acceleration , @xmath44 .",
    "this can be seen on figure [ fig : acceleration ] where the acceleration felt at different distances to the earth center is shown . due to the mass distribution kink seen in figure [ fig : density ] at a radius of about 3500 km ,",
    "the acceleration becomes almost constantly equal to its surface value from this radius , outwards .",
    "m / s@xmath14 at the surface .",
    "the analytical curve is given by the simple scaling @xmath45 by assuming a homogeneous mass distribution.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    using the prem density distribution @xmath46 in eq .",
    "as an input to eq .  , the more elaborate result for the age difference of the earth center and the surface is @xmath47 with the center being youngest .    as a , perhaps , intriguing side - effect ,",
    "we show the time difference as a function of radius , see figure [ fig : tvariatione ] .",
    "as expected , the two theories predict similar time differences near the surface of the earth .",
    "closer to the center , the prem yields a larger result than the homogeneous distribution .",
    "this is because @xmath48 for small @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , assuming for simplicity that the object of radius @xmath0 consists of a region of high density for @xmath49 and zero density for @xmath50 , respecting that the total mass equals @xmath1 , and with @xmath51 , @xmath52 , the potential difference between center and surface becomes @xmath53 where @xmath54 is that of the homogeneous distribution .",
    "thus , the factor @xmath55 yields the increase in time difference compared to the homogeneous model .",
    "so for the earth , where this approximation is rather crude , we may set @xmath56 to be 3480 km as seen from the prem curve in figure [ fig : density ] , i.e.  @xmath57 such that @xmath58 somewhat above the factor 1.7 obtained by the numerical method , as expected from the crudeness of this approximation .",
    "we end this section by showing that the time dilation due to the rotational speed of the surface of the earth makes a negligible contribution .",
    "the surface speed is given from the period of rotation as @xmath59 m@xmath60s where @xmath61 s is the stellar day ( the earth rotation period with respect to the fixed stars ) .",
    "since the time dilation in special relativity is given from the lorentz factor @xmath62 as @xmath63 we get with @xmath29 that @xmath64 years , which can be neglected in the present discussion .",
    "clearly , the calculations performed in connection with the earth can be performed for essentially any other cosmic object with known mass and radius , at least in the limit of a homogeneous mass distribution .",
    "however , we limit the additional cases to our cosmic neighbourhood , i.e.  to that of the sun , in order to demonstrate the applicability of eq .  .",
    "for the sun , in analogy with the prem which is based on seismic data , we choose the so - called model s for its density distribution , a model in good agreement with helioseismic data @xcite .        in the homogeneous case ,",
    "the age difference between the sun center and surface , which can be rewritten as @xmath65 with @xmath66 being the surface escape velocity , is @xmath67 whereas with the model s solar model it becomes @xmath68 see figure [ fig : tvariations ] .",
    "the factor of @xmath69 difference between these two numbers is substantially larger than that between the same two numbers for the earth .",
    "this is a result of the earth being relatively homogeneous while for the sun , a significantly larger part of its mass is located close to its center . using eq .   and",
    "approximating @xmath70 from the density distribution , the model s curve in figure [ fig : densitysun ] , we get a factor @xmath71 , a much better approximation than for the case of the earth .",
    "as a final discussion we address the question : why did famous , respectable and clever physicists publish feynman s claim ( although not verbatim , actually ) that `` [ feynman ] concluded that the center of the earth should be a day or two younger than its surface '' @xcite , or `` [ feynman ] concludes that the center of the earth should be by a day or two younger than its surface '' @xcite and reversely `` atoms at the surface of the earth are a couple of days older than at its center '' , in the latter case even with the comment `` this was confirmed by airplane experiments in 1970s '' @xcite ? and why did other , equally talented physicists not correct _ that _ particular mistake in the foreword to the transcribed lectures , in spite of quite extensive discussions , spanning 24 pages , of among other things a few misconceptions etc . @xcite",
    "? not to mention the transcribers - postdocs with feynman - who , along the way , probably have corrected a few mistakes here and there ? or the editor , who also provided introductory notes on quantum gravity @xcite",
    "? why did one of us ( uiu ) , repeat the same mistake in a science book for the layman @xcite ?",
    "this , of course , was not because any of these physicists were unable to check the original claim , or found it particularly laborious to do so .",
    "instead , it seems likely that they knew that the qualitative effect had to be there , and simply trusted that feynman and his transcribers had got the number right .",
    "this is here considered an example of proof by ethos @xcite .",
    "the term proof by ethos refers to cases where a scientist s status in the community is so high that everybody else takes this person s calculations or results for granted . in other words ,",
    "nobody questions the validity of that scientist s claim because of the particular ethos that is associated with that person .",
    "the result is accepted merely by trust .",
    "indeed , the proof by ethos is not really a proof as it does not follow logically from a set of premises .",
    "but it is a proof in the sense that it is persuasive , and tells us something about how scientists work in practice when they accept a calculation or an experimental result .",
    "scientists must to a large extent rely on the validation of other fellow s work , and it happens to be a psychological default condition among many ( scientists ) , that if a famous peer has publicly announced a result , it is accepted at face value .",
    "this seems also to be the situation in the case of the flawed estimate of the relativistic age of the earth s core .    in science , one route to becoming famous is being right on some important topics .",
    "however , just because someone has become famous , this person is evidently not necessarily right on all matters .",
    "feynman himself would most likely have agreed with this and he would probably not have fallen for his own miscalculation : for a long time , his own theory of beta decay was at odds with the then prevalent , but false , understanding of existing experimental results . upon finally realizing and correcting",
    "this community - wide misunderstanding feynman wrote : `` since then i never pay any attention to ' ' experts `` .",
    "i calculate everything myself . ''",
    "@xcite . and",
    "when faced with a mistake of his own , he put it even more bluntly : `` what it says in the book [ i have written ] is absolutely wrong ! ''",
    "+ in spite of the small numerical mistake , feynman s observation that the center of the earth is younger than its surface is a fascinating demonstration of time dilation in relativity , and as such a very illustrative example for use in the classroom .",
