    "drell - yan experiments have a long history ( the idea is introduced in@xcite , a brief introduction to later developments may be found in chapter 5 of @xcite and in the reviews@xcite and @xcite , while an extensive data collection has been organized in the hepdata database@xcite .",

    "one of the most interesting and controversial observables measured in unpolarized drell - yan is the so - called @xmath0coefficient@xcite associated with the @xmath1azimuthal asymmetry in the rest frame of the dilepton pair .",
    "this quantity is relevant because of its association with the violation of the pqcd lam - tung relation@xcite , and with the t - odd boer - mulders distribution function@xcite .",
    "the cross section for drell - yan dilepton production in scattering of unpolarized hadrons ( charged pion , proton or antiproton vs a target nucleus ) may be approximately written in the parton model form    @xmath2    where @xmath3 depends on variables associated with the virtual photon ( equivalently : the dilepton pair as an overall ) . even if it is not written explicitly",
    ", @xmath4 depends on @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 as well . the angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 characterize @xmath10 of the two leptons ( since now on : the positive one ) in a suitable frame where the virtual photon is at rest .",
    "although different choices exist for such a frame , here we will use the collins - soper frame@xcite .",
    "we have to do with three relevant frames here : ( 1 ) the lab frame , where the target is at rest , ( 2 ) the `` collider '' frame , i.e. the center of mass frame of the projectile and of the hit nucleon , ( 3 ) the collins - soper frame .",
    "the angular cutoff that is relevant in this work is imposed on the polar angle of both the leptons in the laboratory frame .",
    "we will indicate such angles as @xmath11 . without suffix",
    ", @xmath8 and @xmath9 will be the angles of the positive lepton in the collins - soper frame .",
    "the collider frame is necessary for calculating the longitudinal fractions and some auxiliary variables needed to define the collins - soper frame ( for any event , we have a different collins - soper frame ) .",
    "the difference @xmath12 of the 3-momenta of the colliding hadrons in the collider frame identifies a direction , that is chosen as the @xmath13 axis of the collins - soper frame .",
    "the momentum @xmath14 of the virtual photon ( of the dilepton pair ) in the collider frame identifies the @xmath15 plane in the collins - soper frame .",
    "the angles @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the polar and the azimuthal angles of the positive lepton in this frame .    in unpolarized drell - yan , @xmath4 may be written as a linear sum , where we focusdistribution , but not directly concerning the following considerations .",
    "also , the parameter @xmath16 has been taken at its value 1 , that is equivalent to assuming full dominance of born-1 vector boson exchange .",
    "so the present analysis does not extend to e.g. drell - yan in the charmonium mass region . ] on the @xmath17 term@xcite :    @xmath18    the @xmath1asymmetry is a `` quadrupolar '' azimuthal asymmetry . in the laboratory frame , let us name `` lepton plane '' the plane containing the two lepton momenta @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and collision plane the one containing the beam axis @xmath21 and the dilepton ( or virtual photon ) momentum @xmath14 @xmath22 @xmath19 @xmath23 @xmath20 . in events with positive @xmath24",

    "there is no sensitivity to dipolar ( lepton exchange ) effects @xmath25 @xmath26 . ]    in a fixed target drell - yan experiment it is common to have a dead forward cone in the laboratory , and often a dead backward cone , where lepton tracks are invisible or submerged by noise . in other words , if @xmath11 is the angle of a lepton in the laboratory frame , it is quite normal to have the acceptance limits @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath11 @xmath28 @xmath29 . in the forward direction ,",
    "the cone occupied by the beam and by the diffraction products of the hadron collisions is a zero acceptance region . for a beam energy of magnitude 100 gev",
    "this normally means a few degrees , decreasing at increasing beam energy .    although both a forward and a backward cutoff produce effects like the ones discussed in the following , in this work we will limit the discussion to the effects of a forward cutoff .",
    "we will also restrict to the beam energy region 10 - 300 gev .",
    "this region includes the available measurements@xcite of a nonzero value for @xmath30 , has been found compatible with zero by e866@xcite , but in a high - energy / small-@xmath31 regime that makes this measurement peculiar .",
    "we will not care such situation here . ] and some proposals for measuring it in the near future@xcite .     and @xmath32 are the tracks of a lepton pair composing an event where the lepton plane and the collision plane are parallel , while @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the tracks of a lepton pair in an event where the lepton plane and the collision plane are perpendicular . for both events",
    "@xmath14 @xmath22 @xmath19 @xmath23 @xmath20 is the same and is tangent to the forward dead cone .",
    "evidently , one of the four lepton tracks falls inside the dead cone ( @xmath35 ) , so that the @xmath36 event is not detected .",
    "the @xmath37 event is detected .",
    "[ fig : g2],width=340 ]    the key qualitative statement of this work is that a forward dead cone removes preferentially events where the lepton plane and the collision plane are parallel .",
    "this may be seen in the very peculiar example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] .",
    "the relevant elements appearing in this figure are :    \\1 ) a forward dead cone ( with enlarged opening with respect to reality , for illustration purposes ) ;    \\2 ) two possible lepton pairs ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) with the same @xmath14 @xmath22 @xmath19 @xmath23 @xmath20 , but different space orientation for the lepton - antilepton plane ;    \\3 ) @xmath14 is chosen so to be tangent to the dead cone surface .",
    "in the @xmath36 case one of the two leptons falls inside the dead cone . since the pair is accepted only if @xmath38 opposite - charge lepton tracks are detected , this pair is removed from the event collection of the experiment . in the @xmath37 case",
    "neither @xmath33 nor @xmath34 is inside the dead cone , so this pair is detected and enters the event collection of the experiment .",
    "the @xmath36 pair has negative @xmath24 , the @xmath37 pair positive @xmath24 .",
    "generalizing this example , a forward dead cone introduces a systematic anysotropy with respect to @xmath24 into the distribution of the detected dilepton pairs . how large is this effect",
    "this will be studied in a systematic way by a suitable montecarlo simulation .    in the following ,",
    "we simulate the effects of a forward dead cone in some typical conditions for a fixed target drell - yan experiment with @xmath39 and @xmath40 projectiles , and a target nucleus with @xmath41 @xmath22 0.4 . in these simulations ,",
    "the @xmath30 term is constrained to be zero , so any produced @xmath24 asymmetry originates in statistical fluctuations or in systematic errors .",
    "we will show several simulation results .",
    "the first one among the presented simulations ( fig.2 ) considers a case where there is no forward acceptance cutoff , so that we can have an idea of the magnitude of a false asymmetry due to statistical effects only .",
    "the following figures 3 to 6 present examples of simulated measurements where an artificial asymmetry is produced that sometimes is larger than statistical fluctuations .",
    "then we devote the remaining figures and sections 3 , 4 , and 5 to study the dependence of the false asymmetry on some experimental parameters and some further cutoffs that are often imposed .",
    "in particular we show that a ( strong ) cutoff on polar angle in the collins - soper frame reduces the effects of a laboratory frame angular cutoff .",
    "this should have `` protected '' the results of at least one of the past quoted experiments ( na10 ) from the problem discussed here .",
    "the montecarlo simulation of drell - yan pairs is performed with the same generator code@xcite and general technique used in @xcite and other works .",
    "all details about the event generation technique may be found in the related references . a critical discussion of the underlying formalism may be found in @xcite .",
    "first , 50,000 drell - yan @xmath43 pairs produced in antiproton - nucleus collisions have been generated with the kinematic cutoffs described below .",
    "to estimate statistical fluctuations this 50,000@xmath47event generation has been repeated six times , with different sequencies of random numbers .",
    "we name `` experiment '' a single set of 50,000 events .",
    "so e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : x1 ] summarizes the information extracted from 6 `` experiment repetitions '' .",
    "each point in the plots is the value of an observable , averaged over the six repetitions , whereas each error bar is the standard deviation that quantifies the corresponding fluctuation .",
    "it was tested@xcite that the average value and the size of the fluctuations are stable if the number of repetitions is increased over six .",
    "the general simulation technique is the same for figures 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 .",

    "the cuts on @xmath45 , @xmath48 and @xmath7 previously described are imposed on the virtual photon before , to allow for the @xmath50 decay . in each `` experiment ''",
    "the montecarlo simulation is stopped after 50,000 events have been sorted with the described cutoffs . the resulting @xmath31 distribution and the corresponding asymmetry for the 50,000 events are presented in fig .",

    "the projectile longitudinal fraction is integrated over . is a procedure inspired by those planned single - spin drell - yan experiments where the target is polarized and one will measure at the same time unpolarized and single - spin asymmetries with the aim of extracting transversity@xcite from the combination of the two measurements@xcite ] the events in each bin are then divided into two sub - bins corresponding to positive and negative values of @xmath24 with populations @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "e.g. , the pair @xmath37 of fig .",
    "[ fig : g2 ] has @xmath9 @xmath22 90@xmath59 and would contribute to the population @xmath58 . the asymmetry reported in the lower panel of figs .",
    "[ fig : x1 ] , [ fig : x2 ] , [ fig : x3 ] is the rationalized difference @xmath60 .",
    "this way of calculating the @xmath0related asymmetry is especially simple , and in absence of any forward dead cone , it would lead to measured asymmetries that are roughly @xmath61 @xmath62 .",
    "as it is evident from eq.[eq : e2 ] , @xmath30 coincides with @xmath60 when this quantity is estimated from a subset of events with @xmath8 @xmath63 90@xmath59 . to include the full phase space ( or at least the region @xmath64 @xmath28 0.8 - 0.9 , as it is usual ) means to reduce the resulting asymmetry by about a factor 2 . since @xmath65 reduces @xmath66 while the factor @xmath67 increases @xmath68 in eq.[eq : e2 ] .",
    "as previously stressed , all the simulations of this work were performed with @xmath30 @xmath22 0 , in such way to extract a pure error .",

    ", the cut @xmath89 rejects 30% events .",
    "the additional reduction on the number of accepted events due the forward dead cone comes out to be 4 % only , and to this 4 % we must attribute the residual 2 % false asymmetry effect .",
    "it must be remarked that this still means something like @xmath90 @xmath61 0.5 .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : xtheta ] it can be also deduced that a hard @xmath64 cutoff assures a clean asymmetry measurement even without model - dependent montecarlo corrections , but at the cost of a relevant reduction in the experiment statistics .",
    "the fake asymmetries induced by cuts on the acceptance in the forward region feature a behavior very similar to the one of the asymmetries measured in the experiments previously cited : both decrease at increasing @xmath80 , both increase at increasing @xmath7 .",
    "moreover , the size of the integrated asymmetries is similar .",
    "so , the discussion about the measured @xmath30 values deserves some attention to the details of the analysis of the experimental data .    with more than 10,000 useful events , and in the same kinematical regime considered in this work ( beam energies far below 1000 gev ) , @xmath30 has been measured by the collaborations na3@xcite , na10@xcite , e615@xcite in the decade 1980 - 90 , leading to results that are similar in magnitude ( @xmath30 @xmath61 0.1 at @xmath7 @xmath52 1 gev / c ) and present similar qualitative behaviors , within error bars . although the related papers quoted here report a quite careful description of the data analysis procedure followed , it is impossible to get from them some detailed information like that nowadays accessible via on - line phd theses . however , in at least one paper for each collaboration a figure is presented showing a non - flat acceptance as a function of @xmath9 , so it is likely that all the acceptance problems have been implicitly matched .",
    "because of the limited phase space covered , in the na10 experiment the @xmath64 minimum was set to 0.5 or 0.6 , depending on the run ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding fake asymmetry is negligible , as it can be deduced from fig .",
    "[ fig : xtheta ] .",
    "the other experiments previously considered@xcite do not put such severe constraints on @xmath8 , but their results are similar to those from na10 .    summarizing , we have shown that a forward dead cone in the laboratory frame , in a fixed target unpolarized drell - yan experiment in an intermediate energy range , seriously distortes a measurement of the lam - tung - style lepton asymmetry .",
    "this does not seem to be a problem when considering the results of past experiments .",
    "it could be a more serious problem for future experiments aiming at much smaller error bars than in the past .",
    "the most obvious and model - independent technique to overcome this problem is to artificially reduce the acceptance in terms of collins - soper frame variables , but this has a relevant cost in terms of final available statistics .",
