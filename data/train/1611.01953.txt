    "the rows containing the blueshifted jet extending up to 2  from the star were examined to remove the semi - periodic baseline undulations resulting from wavelength rectification of the undersampled star . to each row , we fit and subtract the baseline with a legendre polynomial up to the tenth order , depending on the distance to the star .",

    "astrophysical emission lines are generally not gaussian , but , where appropriate , single gaussian fits do provide robust estimates of the bulk velocity ( the line centroid ) and the line broadening",
    ". visual inspection of the pv diagrams shows that single gaussians often do not suffice to describe the observed line profiles , so we decomposed the spectra into different velocity components by fitting two independent gaussian profiles every 005 .",
    "these line profiles can appear double - peaked , flat - topped , or skewed , depending on the relative fluxes of gases at different velocities .",
    "this can be visualized through the v - shaped isocontours in the pv diagrams for the innermost 1  of the jet ( figure [ stis_allpv ] ) , which is suggestive of double velocity components .",
    "indeed , it has long been known that double velocity components exist in the dg tau jet @xcite . while the fitting and the decomposition are a mathematical exercise , the component centroids and widths constrain the true physical velocity distributions of the gas .",
    "where two distinct gaussian components are mathematically required , we interpret the two components as distinct regions at different bulk velocities . the variations of these principal velocity components with position along the jet can be either continuous or abrupt depending on the propagation history of the jet .",
    "the relative fluxes of these principal velocity components may also change along the flow .",
    "these variations provide insights into the ejection history and possible variations of properties close to the jet launching region .",
    "we used the iraf / stsdas ngaussfit task to interactively give initial guesses for the gaussian parameters and then recursively minimized @xmath52 with the amoeba algorithm .",

    "two exposures of the same nodding positions were combined during the reduction cascade , and the combined data of the two nodding positions were connected by matching the spectrally summed spatial profiles along the jet axis .",

    "the main differences are the spatial resolution and the settings of the slit observations .",
    "the point spread function ( psf ) of the _ hst _ optical instruments is defraction - limited to @xmath48 , whereas that of the vlt is seeing - limited to @xmath76 at the time of the observation .",
    "the slit widths match the psf at observations , and the widths of 01 and 12 were used for stis and x - shooter , respectively .",
    "although spatial resolutions can not be matched , spatial coverages of the two observations can be kept similar for the analysis .",
    "therefore , the stis spectra transversely averaged across 052 were used when comparisons of velocity centroids were made and longitudally averaged line profiles from both spectra were used to compare the overall representative spectral features between the two observational epochs .",
    "figure [ optical_timevar_vc ] compares the properties of the optical forbidden lines of the hvc and lvc between epochs 1999 and 2010 , based on [ n ii ] @xmath62 emission from the two epochs .",
    "the left panels compare spatial variations of their velocity centroids .",
    "the positions of the 1999 data points have been shifted to the 2010 epoch to account for their proper motions according to their respective velocity centroids .",
    "the velocity centroids of [ ne iii ] @xmath0 were overlaid to indicate the regions based on the features of [ ne iii ] emission : the brightest `` microjet '' from 05 to 25 , non - detected `` interknot '' from 28 to 50 , and `` knot a@xmath121b '' from 5  to 8 . in the right panels , we compare the integrated [ n ii ] line profiles of the microjet between 1999 and 2010 .",
    "the 1999 line profile is obtained by summing over 01 to 07 from the 1999 spectra , corresponding to the innermost microjet .",
    "the 2010 line profiles are obtained in two parts , one summing over the `` microjet '' region as the initial microjet in 2010 , and another summing over the `` interknot '' region .",
    "for the hvc , the portion of the microjet in the 1999 data matches the 2010 `` interknot '' region well in both velocity centroids and positions .",
    "this suggests that the initial microjet moves out without much interaction with previous ejecta in this region .",
    "for the lvc , the emission is not spatially extended and no clear interknot emission can be detected .",
    "the propagation or variation pattern is relatively unclear and does not show clear trends between the two epochs .    from comparisons of the spatial variations of velocity centroids ,",
    "we conclude that the emission from the innermost microjet is not stationary .",
    "the hvc centroids of [ n ii ] @xmath62 have changed from a median value of @xmath7 kms@xmath3  in 1999 to @xmath4 kms@xmath3  in the 2010 x - shooter spectra .",
    "the shifted 1999 data points for the microjet match those for the interknot region well in the 2010 x - shooter data in both velocities and positions .",
    "the transitions appear to be smooth , and the matches in kinematic properties of between the two epochs suggest that the flow does not slow down significantly due to interactions with previous ejecta . the properties of both [ n ii ] and [ ne iii ] emission lines in the microjet are consistent with a recombination flow .",
    "the [ ne iii ] @xmath0 spatial profile is consistent with the flow recombining , and then being reionized , before the knot a@xmath121b . the average [ s ii ] @xmath257 ratio increases from 0.5 to 0.8 , corresponding to a decrease in @xmath258 from @xmath259 to @xmath260 @xmath9 , at distances from 05 to 45 , where the knot a@xmath121b starts to form with an increase in @xmath258 to @xmath261 @xmath9 . in the next subsection",
    ", we suggest a possible mechanism that might cause the decrease in the hvc velocity in the microjet and momentarily account for the dominant initial ionization in the microjet .",
    "comparison of the line profiles at two different epochs shows an overall decrease in jet speed from 1999 to 2010 , without evidence for deceleration by discrete shocks .",
    "one possible cause of such a decrease in jet speed is the increase in the launching radius of the jet . assuming that the terminal speed of the jet is proportional to the keplerian speed at the launching radius and that the proportion remains the same for the two configurations at different epochs , the ratio of the two velocities ( @xmath262 ) corresponds to a change in the launching radius by a factor of @xmath186 ( @xmath263 ) . at the inclination angle to the dg tau system ,",
    "the deprojected flow velocity in 1999 is @xmath264 kms@xmath3 .",
    "as demonstrated in the x - wind sample fits to the jet and counterjet of rw aur a in @xcite , the ratio of the terminal wind speed @xmath265 to the keplerian speed at the truncation radius , @xmath266 , can range from 1.5 to 3.5 , depending on the mass loading in the magnetic field lines of the wind . if @xmath267 is adopted , @xmath268 kms@xmath3 .",
    "the estimated stellar mass of dg tau is @xmath269 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and one may derive the truncation radius @xmath270 au . in this scenario ,",
    "the change in hvc centroids may correspond to a change in truncation radius from 0.05 au in 1999 to 0.10 au in 2010 .",
    "one possible explanation for the increase in the disk truncation radius is an expansion of the stellar magnetosphere , which pushes out the disk . at equilibrium ,",
    "the inner edge of the disk can corrotate with the star due to regulation by the magnetic field connecting the star and the disk .",
    "when the magnetosphere expands , the inner edge of the disk will change from one equilibrium to a new equilibrium position further away from the star with a lower keplerian speed . during the transition , the angular speed of the star and the inner disk edge may not coincide with each other , i.e. , @xmath271 .",
    "this may induce magnetic reconnections for the field lines connecting the star to the disk , and a fraction of the energy release may contribute to the hardening of x - rays . in the fluctuating x - wind theory @xcite , the amount of x - ray luminosity generated through magnetic reconnection is proportional to the square of the ( dimensionless ) dipole flux @xmath272 of order unity and the energy scale for disk accretion , @xmath273 , both computed at the truncation radius .",
    "this proportional factor , which may range from 0.1 to 0.01 , depends on the fraction of magnetic energy released , aside from that used for particle acceleration , and on the efficiency of energy conversion .",
    "taking the disk accretion rate @xmath274 to be of the same order as the mass accretion rate onto the star @xmath275 , the energy scale for disk accretion is of the order of @xmath276 ergs@xmath3 .",
    "the resulting total x - ray luminosity would be of the order of @xmath277 to @xmath231 ergs@xmath3 and is sufficient to power the hard x - ray source close to dg tau and to account for the ionization for [ ne iii ] @xmath0 emission in the jet .",
    "we have studied the kinematics and ionization properties of the dg tau jet using archival _",
    "hst_/stis spectra taken in 1999 january and new vlt / x - shooter spectra taken 11 years later . for both data sets",
    ", we identify an hvc that is spatially extended and connected to outer knots and an lvc that dominates within @xmath278 through gaussian decomposition .",
    "optical [ o i ] , [ s ii ] , and [ n ii ] line emission in the 1999 stis spectra has various velocity centroids ; [ n ii ] has the fastest hvc at @xmath279 kms@xmath3and lvc at @xmath253 kms@xmath3  and [ s ii ] has the slowest hvc at @xmath280 kms@xmath3and lvc at @xmath281 kms@xmath3 .",
    "in contrast , all the forbidden lines in the 2010 x - shooter spectra show a relatively uniform hvc at @xmath282 kms@xmath3  and lvc at @xmath283 kms@xmath3 .    in the 2010 x - shooter spectra , [ ne iii ] @xmath0",
    "is detected in the innermost microjet up to @xmath117 and reappears as the unresolved knots a@xmath121b at @xmath284 , but is virtually undetected in knot c at @xmath285 .",
    "both the hvc and lvc of the microjet peak within @xmath286 of the star .",
    "the hvc has a large line width up to @xmath91 kms@xmath3  close to the source .",
    "the intensity of the hvc and lvc is comparable , with a dereddened flux of @xmath287 erg@xmath40s@xmath3 , assuming @xmath288 @xcite .",
    "the profile at the knot a@xmath121b is singly peaked at @xmath289 kms@xmath3 , close to the [ n ii ] hvc centroid in 1999 .",
    "the flux at this knot is much fainter than the inner microjet by an order of magnitude .",
    "we discuss possible origins of [ ne iii ] emission in light of the known x - ray sources in the dg tau system .",
    "shocks of a few hundred kms@xmath3  suffice to both collisionally ionize neon and heat the gas up to the megakelvin temperatures seen in the soft x - ray source 02 from dg tau .",
    "however , the same shocks that account for the soft x - ray luminosity @xcite can produce only @xmath290 of the [ ne ii ] flux observed .",
    "soft x - ray irradiation from stationary stellar wind shocks @xcite may partially contribute to the ionization , but is swamped by the extant hard coronal x - ray source .",
    "the hard coronal source , with impulsive flares up to @xmath233 ergs@xmath3 , may be able to account for the observed [ ne iii ] flux , although recurring flares are needed to account for the extended emission .",
    "possible soft x - ray or magnetic heating that maintains the @xmath45 k gas associated with the c iv jet @xcite may alternatively freeze the ionization in the jet and account for the observed spatial extent of the [ ne iii ] microjet .",
    "the outer knot a@xmath121b may be reionized by a strong shock @xmath291 kms@xmath3  which would re - invigorate the [ ne iii ] emission and produce the extended soft x - ray emission .",
    "the 11 year baseline also allows us to examine changes in the velocity structure of the optical forbidden emission lines .",
    "the hvc velocity centroids decreased by about 30% over these 11 years , while the lvc was little changed .",
    "a possible explanation for the decrease in jet speed is an increase in the truncation radius ( as well as the jet launching radius ) caused by expansion of the stellar magnetosphere .",
    "the change in velocity would correspond to an increase in radius by a factor of @xmath292 , assuming that the overall magnetospheric configuration does not change after expansion .",
    "magnetic reconnection produced during the readjustment of the inner disk radius may provide a sufficiently luminous x - ray source to explain the observed [ ne ii ] and [ ne iii ] fluxes , but further x - ray and optical spectroscopic observations will be required to test this hypothesis .    the authors would like to thank the anonymous referee whose constructive comments helped to improve the clarity of the manuscript .",
