    "<S> the possible existence of a  bubble \" structure in the proton density of @xmath0si has recently attracted a lot of research interest . to examine the existence of the  bubble \" structure in low - lying states , </S>",
    "<S> we establish a relativistic version of configuration mixing of both particle number and angular momentum projected quadrupole deformed mean - field states and apply this state - of - the - art beyond relativistic mean - field method to study the density distribution of the low - lying states in @xmath0si . an excellent agreement with the data of low - spin spectrum and electric multipole transition strengths </S>",
    "<S> is achieved without introducing any parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the central depression in the proton density is quenched by dynamic quadrupole shape fluctuation , but not as significantly as what has been found in a beyond non - relativistic mean - field study . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that the existence of proton  bubble \" structure in the low - lying excited @xmath1 and @xmath2 states is very unlikely .    </S>",
    "<S> covariant density functional theory , beyond mean - field approximation , low - lying states , density distribution    _ introduction_.@xmath3 in recent years , there has been a growing interest in searching for  bubble \" nuclei , in which the density in the center vanishes or is significantly lower than saturation density . the  bubble \" nuclei </S>",
    "<S> are of particular interest because they have different mean - field potentials from those of normal nuclei with fermi - type density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the splitting of spin - orbit partners located mainly at the nuclear center is reduced in the  bubble \" nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> some modern parametrizations of the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) @xcite and of the skyrme energy density functional ( edf ) @xcite , as well as the mean - field calculation using semi - realistic interactions  @xcite predict a hollow proton density for @xmath4 and some neutron - rich ar isotopes . at the time being , @xmath4 stands out as the only candidate on which many different studies agree . </S>",
    "<S> the possible proton `` bubble '' structure of this nucleus has also been suggested as an explanation for the recently observed reduction of the spin - orbit splitting using the transfer reactions @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the intruder @xmath1 state and its weak electric monopole transition to the ground - state were measured  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results support the coexistence structure of a spherical ground - state with a large deformed @xmath1 state in @xmath0si . </S>",
    "<S> the spectroscopy of low - lying states provides a strong test of the nuclear structure models that have been used to study the density profiles .    </S>",
    "<S> most recently , the stability of  bubble \" structure against dynamical effects in @xmath0si has been examined in the framework of a particle - number ( pn ) and angular - momentum ( am ) projected generator coordinate method ( gcm ) based on hartree - fock - bogoliubov ( hfb ) states with axial quadrupole deformation using the non - relativistic skyrme force sly4  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that the dynamic effect of quadrupole shape fluctuation significantly altered the radial density profile , and brought it closer to a fermi - type density distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we noted , however , that the spectroscopic properties of the observed low - lying states were not reproduced very well  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated two lowest @xmath7 states were too strongly mixed , which might overestimate the effect of shape mixing on the density of ground - state . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in the context of projected gcm based on self - consistent mean - field approaches , the density profiles of excited states have not been studied yet . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the proton  bubble \" structure in the low - lying excited states of @xmath0si is not known .    during the past decades </S>",
    "<S> , the rmf theory has achieved great success in describing many nuclear phenomena for both stable and exotic nuclei over the entire nuclear chart with a few universal parameters  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it incorporates many important relativistic effects , such as the presence of large lorentz scalar and vector fields with approximately equal magnitude and opposite sign . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to a new saturation mechanism via the difference between the scalar and vector densities , and naturally to the large spin - orbit interaction needed for the understanding of magic numbers in finite nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the aim of the present letter is to address the above issue using a beyond rmf approach .    _ </S>",
    "<S> the method_.@xmath3 to this end , we extend the beyond rmf method presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite by including additionally pn projection and restricting it to axially deformed states by imposing triaxial deformation parameter @xmath8 to be @xmath9 or @xmath10 . in this case , the wave function of nuclear low - lying state is given by the superposition of both pn and am projected rmf wave functions constrained to have different intrinsic axial deformations @xmath11 , @xmath12 with @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 being the projection operators onto good number of angular momentum , neutrons and protons , respectively . </S>",

    "<S> the energy overlap in the energy kernel is taken with the same functional form as the nuclear mean - field energy , but replacing the densities and currents with mixed ones  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in recent years several similar beyond mean - field methods ( gcm+pnp+amp ) are developed by different groups based on either non - relativistic or relativistic edfs  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> once the wavefunctions of low - lying states are found , it is straightforward to calculate the density distribution in @xmath22-space . </S>",
    "<S> the density distribution for the state @xmath18 is found as  @xcite @xmath23 where the @xmath24 is defined as @xmath25 the sum over index @xmath26 represents summation over all occupied single - particle states for neutrons or protons .    </S>",
    "<S> the reduced electric quadrupole ( @xmath27 ) transition strengths between low - lying states are given by @xmath28 and are calculated directly in the laboratory frame without approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced matrix elements in the above expression are determined as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the electric quadrupole moment operator . </S>",
    "<S> the nuclear matrix element entering the electric monopole decay from @xmath31 to @xmath32 through the emission of conversion electrons is determined by @xmath33 where @xmath34 is an index running over all proton single - particle states . </S>",
    "<S> the radius @xmath35 is given by @xmath36  fm . </S>",
    "<S> since the electric transition matrix elements are calculated in the full model space of occupied single - particle states , there is no need to introduce effective charges , and the bare charge for protons is used instead .    </S>",
    "<S> _ numerical details_.@xmath3 in the rmf calculations , parity , @xmath37-simplex symmetry , and time - reversal invariance are imposed . </S>",
    "<S> the dirac equation is solved by expanding in the basis of eigenfunctions of a three - dimensional harmonic oscillator in cartesian coordinate with 10 major shells , which are found to be sufficient to obtain reasonably converged results for @xmath0si . a constraint on the axial mass quadrupole moment @xmath38 </S>",

    "<S> this density distribution corresponds to the spherical mean - field configuration , for which case , the occupation probability of proton @xmath66 orbital is zero due to pairing collapse . </S>",
    "<S> the mixing of configurations of different intrinsic shapes resulting from dynamic fluctuation in quadrupole deformations can alter the occupancy of the @xmath66 orbital and therefore change the density distribution in the center . </S>",

    "<S> however , the beyond rmf calculation gives a smaller quenching effect than that the one found in the beyond non - relativistic mean - field calculation , which can be mainly attributed to the difference in the distribution of wave function in the collective space , i.e. , the wave function of ground - state in this work is more concentrated around the spherical shape than that given in ref .  </S>",
