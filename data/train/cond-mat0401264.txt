    "the strongly correlated systems in one spatial dimension ( 1d ) attracted an enormous theoretical and experimental interest last decade .",
    "the 1d fermionic and spin systems were recognized long ago as the useful theoretical models , where the interaction effects are very important and at the same time are subject to rigorous analysis .",
    "@xcite the experimental discovery of the systems of predominantly 1d character inspired the renewed interest to this class of problems . among the experimental realizations of the 1d systems one can mention the bechgaards salts , carbon nanotubes , copper oxides spin ladders and purely organic spin chain compounds .",
    "@xcite    while the physics of purely one - dimensional objects , or chains , is well understood , @xcite the spin ladders are still under intense investigation .",
    "even the isolated spin chains reveal a variety of unusual phenomena , including the haldane gap , spin - peierls transition , magnetization plateaus .",
    "the ladders , consisting of a few coupled spin chains are generally much richer in their behavior , and pose additional theoretical problems .",
    "the interest to the problem of ladders may be traced back to the earlier attempts to construct the continous representation of spin @xmath3 variable in 1d out of @xmath2 quantities .",
    "@xcite the methods elaborated in these studies are now widely used in the analysis of the ladder systems .    the basic model for the spin chain , the antiferromagnetic ( af ) heisenberg @xmath2 chain , is thoroughly studied by various methods .",
    "@xcite this may be one of the reasons , why a majority of the theoretical papers discussing the spin ladders are now confined to the treatment of quantum spin @xmath2 with antiferromagnetic interaction along the legs .",
    "spin ladders with different spins or with a ferromagnetic leg exchange attracted much less attention .",
    "the spin chains and ladders consisting of different spins @xcite and with the af leg exchange were considered recently in @xcite .",
    "particularly , the ferrimagnetic chains with alternating spin-1/2 and spin-1 were discussed there .",
    "it was shown that , contrary to the case of equal spins , the uncompensated spin value in a unit cell leads to the gap in the spectrum and the appearance of the long range magnetic order . @xcite",
    "the spin-1/2 ladder with ferromagnetic exchange along the legs was studied in @xcite .",
    "a rather rich phase diagram was demonstrated , depending on the details of the magnetic anisotropies for the leg and rung couplings .    in the present paper",
    "we study the mixed spin ( @xmath3 , @xmath2 ) spin ladder with the ferromagnetic exchange along the legs and antiferromagnetic interaction on the rungs.in the absence of the rung coupling , the individual chains show the ferromagnetic long - range order ( lro ) , and the ground state is classical . the spectrum and the ground state energy is well described in terms of the linear spin - wave theory .",
    "@xcite we show that the inclusion of the antiferromagnetic rung coupling drives the system into the quantum regime , understood in terms of the af heisenberg spin-1/2 chain . in this regime",
    "the magnetic lro is absent , and the spatial correlations show the power - law decay .",
    "note that the uncompensated spin in a unit cell leads to the absence of the gap in low - lying excitation spectra .",
    "this primary observation is interesting on its own , because two limiting cases of the model allow the asymptotically exact solutions with gapless spectra .",
    "hence our further motivation to study the crossover region starting from both limiting points .",
    "we discuss the regimes of weak and strong rung coupling for different types of the leg exchange anisotropy .",
    "the consideration is somewhat complicated by the absence of the established routines for our case .",
    "the bosonization , an extremely useful tool in dealing with af s=1/2 systems , does not fully work here on two reasons . first is the existence of two sorts of spins in a unit cell , and another is the ferromagnetic leg exchange .",
    "hence we supplement our study by the consideration of a similar model , written entirely for @xmath2 but with the modified rung couplings . using these models and comparing different approaches , the spin - wave theory and bosonization",
    ", we arrive at the unified description of the ferrimagnetic spin ladders .",
    "particuarly , we discuss the spectrum and the correlations and observe the crossover from the weak to strong coupling regime .",
    "an attention is paid to a subtler point in the bosonization procedure , a seemingly unstable gaussian effective action near the ferromagnetic point .",

    "@xcite for non - zero af rung exchange @xmath56 can be reduced to the observation that the scalar product @xmath336 on the rung assumes the non - zero value .",
    "let us characterize each state of two spins on a rung @xmath337 in terms of singlet @xmath338 and triplet @xmath339 .",
    "the ground state @xmath340 of the whole ladder has a component comprised of all rung singlets , @xmath341 .",
    "it is clear that for the case of extremely large af rung exchange the weight @xmath342 of @xmath343 in @xmath340 is unity .",
    "one expects that for moderate af @xmath344 this weight @xmath342 is finite .",
    "consider now the spin product on @xmath337th rung @xmath345 with @xmath346 , which may be represented as @xmath347 with @xmath348 projecting onto the @xmath337th singlet and @xmath349 spin-1 operator for the @xmath337th triplet .",
    "note that the presence of @xmath348 makes ( [ rungprod ] ) different from the operator @xmath350 used by den nijs and rommelse in their discussion @xcite of the spin-1 chain .",

    "some inspection shows that these values correspond to ones reported in @xcite for the infinitely long string op .",
    "hence we conclude that the string op discussed in @xcite for af rung interaction can be identified with the scalar product of spins on a rung and measures the weight @xmath342 of the total singlet in the ground state .",
    "it should be stressed , that our above arguments are not applicable for the fm rung interaction , when the lowest rung state is triplet . in this latter case",
    "the string order parameter discussed in @xcite is the appropriate description and can not be reduced to a local scalar product .",
    "clearly , the non - zero average value of the scalar product is disconnected from the appearance of the on - site magnetization , as discussed below .      applying the same type of consideration to our above systems ,",
    "we can say , e.g. , that for the mixed spin ladder the order parameter is the average value of the scalar product on the rung @xmath357 .",

    "notice , that the discussed order parameter is bilinear in spins , independent of the in - leg spin exchange anisotropy and does not imply the ordering of individual spins .",
    "the spin ordering in a proper sense depends on the sign of the uniaxial anisotropy .",
    "particularly , in the case of the easy - plane anisotropy , both the weak and strong rung coupling regimes correspond to xxz model in the absence of lro . therefore one does not expect the spin ordering here .",
    "the case of the easy - axis anisotropy can be analyzed for the mixed spin model .",
    "we showed in sec .",
    "[ sec : mixed ] that the lswt , applicable for isolated chains , fails for the intermediate @xmath56 .",

    "( [ effspins ] ) , ( [ effspins3 ] ) , both the uniform and the staggered magnetization is present in the system . @xcite",
    "we demonstrate above that the mixed spin ladders and triangular ladders with the ferromagnetic coupling along the legs are generic models for description of a transition from the classical ( ferrimagnetic ) to quantum ( antiferromagnetic ) regime .",
    "the individual legs with the isotropic heisenberg exchange show the classical groundstate and their dynamics is well described by the quasiclassical spin - wave theory . turning on",
    "the af rung coupling introduces strong fluctuations , which destroy the long - range order and eventually make the system equivalent to the quantum af spin @xmath2 heisenberg model .",
    "we showed that in a large domain of parameters for these ladders the spin wave theory , although missing certain features caused by quantum fluctuations in one dimension , is still quite instructive for the qualitative determination of the spectra , which allows the further comparison with more sophisticated methods .",

    "the unified description of the model becomes possible , partly including the complicated crossover region from the weak to strong rung coupling limit .",

    "the asymptotic decay of correlation functions is described by unique critical exponent , @xmath371 , for all three projections of spin .",
